Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

ACT I

SCENE I An apartment in the DUKES Palace

Enter DUKE ESCALUS LORDS and ATTENDANTS

DUKE
Escalus

ESCALUS
My lord

DUKE
Of government the properties to unfold
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds in that the lists of all advice
My strength can give you then no more remains
But that to your sufficiency as your worth is able
And let them work The nature of our people
Our citys institutions and the terms
For common justice you are as pregnant in
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember There is our commission
From which we would not have you warpCall hither
I say bid come before us Angelo

Exit an Attendant

What figure of us think you he will bear
For you must know we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply
Lent him our terror drest him with our love
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power what think you of it

ESCALUS
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour
It is Lord Angelo

Enter ANGELO

DUKE
Look where he comes

ANGELO
Always obedient to your graces will
I come to know your pleasure

DUKE
Angelo
There is a kind of character in thy life
That to th observer doth thy history
Fully unfold Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do
Not light them for themselves for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us twere all alike
As if we had them not Spirits are not finely touchd
But to fine issues nor nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But like a thrifty goddess she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor
Both thanks and use But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise
Hold therefore Angelo
In our remove be thou at full ourself
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart Old Escalus
Though first in question is thy secondary
Take thy commission

ANGELO
Now good my lord
Let there be some more test made of my metal
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamped upon it

DUKE
No more evasion
We have with a leavend and prepared choice
Proceeded to you therefore take your honours
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestiond
Matters of needful value We shall write to you
As time and our concernings shall importune
How it goes with us and do look to know
What doth befall you here So fare you well
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions

ANGELO
Yet give leave my lord
That we may bring you something on the way

DUKE
My haste may not admit it
Nor need you on mine honour have to do
With any scruple your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good Give me your hand
Ill privily away I love the people
But do not like to stage me to their eyes
Though it do well I do not relish well
Their loud applause and aves vehement
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it Once more fare you well

ANGELO
The heavens give safety to your purposes

ESCALUS
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness

DUKE
I thank you Fare you well

Exit

ESCALUS
I shall desire you sir to give me leave
To have free speech with you and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place
A powr I have but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed

ANGELO
Tis so with meLet us withdraw together
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point

ESCALUS
Ill wait upon your honour

Exeunt



SCENE II A street

Enter Lucio and two Gentlemen

LUCIO
If the duke with the other dukes come not to composition
with the King of Hungary why then all the dukes fall upon
the king

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Heaven grant us its peace but not the King of Hungarys

SECOND GENTLEMAN
Amen

LUCIO
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea
with the ten
commandments but scraped one out of the table

SECOND GENTLEMAN
Thou shalt not steal

LUCIO
Ay that he razed

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Why twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest
from their
functions they put forth to steal Theres not a soldier of us
all that in
the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that
prays for
peace

SECOND GENTLEMAN
I never heard any soldier dislike it

LUCIO
I believe thee for I think thou never wast where grace was said


SECOND GENTLEMAN
No A dozen times at least

FIRST GENTLEMAN
What in metre

LUCIO
In any proportion or in any language

FIRST GENTLEMAN
I think or in any religion

LUCIO
Ay why not Grace is grace despite of all controversy As for
examplethou
thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Well there went but a pair of shears between us

LUCIO
I grant as there may between the lists and the velvet Thou art
the list

FIRST GENTLEMAN
And thou the velvet thou art good velvet thourt a threepiled
piece I warrant thee I had as lief be a list of an English
kersey as be piled as thou art piled for a French velvet
Do I speak feelingly now

LUCIO
I think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy
speech I will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy
health but whilst I live forget to drink after thee

FIRST GENTLEMAN
I think I have done myself wrong have I not

SECOND GENTLEMAN
Yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free

LUCIO
Behold behold where Madam Mitigation comes I have purchased as
many diseases under her roof as come to

SECOND GENTLEMAN
To what I pray

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Judge

SECOND GENTLEMAN
To three thousand dollars a year

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Ay and more

LUCIO
A French crown more

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of
error I am sound

LUCIO
Nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that
are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee

Enter BAWD

FIRST GENTLEMAN
How now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica

BAWD
Well well theres one yonder arrested and carried to prison was
worth five thousand of you all

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Whos that I pray thee

BAWD
Marry sir thats Claudio Signior Claudio

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Claudio to prison tis not so

BAWD
Nay but I know tis so I saw him arrested saw him carried
away and which is more within these three days his head to
be chopped off

LUCIO
But after all this fooling I would not have it so Art thou
sure of this

BAWD
I am too sure of it and it is for getting Madam Julietta with
child

LUCIO
Believe me this may be he promised to meet me two hours since
and he was ever precise in promisekeeping

SECOND GENTLEMAN
Besides you know it draws something near to the speech we had
to such a purpose

FIRST GENTLEMAN
But most of all agreeing with the proclamation

LUCIO
Away lets go learn the truth of it

Exeunt Lucio and Gentlemen

BAWD

wise burgher put in for them

BAWD
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down

CLOWN
To the ground mistress

BAWD
Why heres a change indeed in the commonwealth What shall
become of me

CLOWN

eyes almost out in the service you will be considered

BAWD
Whats to do here Thomas Tapster Lets withdraw

CLOWN
Here comes Signior Claudio led by the provost to prison and
theres Madam Juliet

Exeunt



Scene III The same

Enter PROVOST CLAUDIO JULIET and Officers LUCIO and two
Gentlemen

CLAUDIO
Fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world
Bear me to prison where I am committed

PROVOST
I do it not in evil disposition
But from Lord Angelo by special charge

CLAUDIO
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heavenon whom it will it will
On whom it will not so yet still tis just

LUCIO
Why how now Claudio whence comes this restraint

CLAUDIO
From too much liberty my Lucio liberty
As surfeit is the father of much fast
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint Our natures do pursue
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane
A thirsty evil and when we drink we die

LUCIO
If I could speak so wisely under an arrest I would send for
certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth I had as
lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of
imprisonmentWhats thy offence Claudio

CLAUDIO
What but to speak of would offend again

LUCIO
What ist murder

CLAUDIO
No

LUCIO
Lechery

CLAUDIO
Call it so

PROVOST
Away sir you must go

CLAUDIO
One word good friendLucio a word with you

Takes him aside

LUCIO
A hundred if theyll do you any good Is lechery so lookeed
after

CLAUDIO
Thus stands it with meUpon a true contract
I got possession of Juliettas bed
You know the lady she is fast my wife
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order this we came not to
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her friends
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet

LUCIO
With child perhaps

CLAUDIO
Unhappily even so
And the new deputy now for the duke
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride
Who newly in the seat that it may know
He can command lets it straight feel the spur
Whether the tyranny be in his place
Or in his eminence that fills it up
I stagger inBut this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have like unscourd armour hung by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn and for a name
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me tis surely for a name

LUCIO
I warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders
that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off Send after the
duke and appeal to him

CLAUDIO
I have done so but hes not to be found
I prythee Lucio do me this kind service
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And there receive her approbation
Acquaint her with the danger of my state
Implore her in my voice that she make friends
To the strict deputy bid herself assay him
I have great hope in that for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect
Such as moves men beside she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse
And well she can persuade

LUCIO
I pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which
else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying
of thy life who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost
at a game of ticktack Ill to her

CLAUDIO
I thank you good friend Lucio

LUCIO
Within two hours

CLAUDIO
Come officer away

Exeunt



SCENE IV A Monastery

Enter DUKE and FRIAR THOMAS

DUKE
No holy father throw away that thought
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth

FRIAR
May your grace speak of it

DUKE
My holy sir none better knows than you
How I have ever lovd the life removd
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth and cost a witless bravery keeps
I have deliverd to Lord Angelo
A man of stricture and firm abstinence
My absolute power and place here in Vienna
And he supposes me travelld to Poland
For so I have strewd it in the common ear
And so it is received Now pious sir
You will demand of me why I do this

FRIAR
Gladly my lord

DUKE
We have strict statutes and most biting laws
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds
Which for this fourteen years we have let sleep
Even like an oergrown lion in a cave
That goes not out to prey Now as fond fathers
Having bound up the threatning twigs of birch
Only to stick it in their childrens sight
For terror not to use in time the rod
Becomes more mockd than feard so our decrees
Dead to infliction to themselves are dead
And liberty plucks justice by the nose
The baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
Goes all decorum

FRIAR
It rested in your grace
To unloose this tiedup justice when you pleasd
And it in you more dreadful would have seemd
Than in Lord Angelo

DUKE
I do fear too dreadful
Sith twas my fault to give the people scope
Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do for we bid this be done
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment Therefore indeed my father
I have on Angelo imposd the office
Who may in the ambush of my name strike home
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander And to behold his sway
I will as twere a brother of your order
Visit both prince and people therefore I prythee
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar Moe reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you
Only this oneLord Angelo is precise
Stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
That his blood flows or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone hence shall we see
If power change purpose what our seemers be

Exeunt


SCENE V A Nunnery

Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA

ISABELLA
And have you nuns no further privileges

FRANCISCA
Are not these large enough

ISABELLA
Yes truly I speak not as desiring more
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clare

LUCIO
Within Ho Peace be in this place

ISABELLA
Whos that which calls

FRANCISCA
It is a mans voice Gentle Isabella
Turn you the key and know his business of him
You may I may not you are yet unsworn
When you have vowd you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress
Then if you speak you must not show your face
Or if you show your face you must not speak
He calls again I pray you answer him

Exit FRANCISCA

ISABELLA
Peace and prosperity Who ist that calls

Enter LUCIO

LUCIO
Hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses
Proclaim you are no less Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio

ISABELLA
Why her unhappy brother let me ask
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister

LUCIO
Gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
Not to be weary with you hes in prison

ISABELLA
Woe me For what

LUCIO
For that which if myself might be his judge
He should receive his punishment in thanks
He hath got his friend with child

ISABELLA
Sir make me not your story

LUCIO
It is true
I would notthough tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
Tongue far from heartplay with all virgins so
I hold you as a thing enskyd and sainted
By your renouncement an immortal spirit
And to be talkd with in sincerity
As with a saint

ISABELLA
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me

LUCIO
Do not believe it Fewness and truth tis thus
Your brother and his lover have embraced
As those that feed grow full as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry

ISABELLA
Some one with child by himMy cousin Juliet

LUCIO
Is she your cousin

ISABELLA
Adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names
By vain though apt affection

LUCIO
She it is

ISABELLA
O let him marry her

LUCIO
This is the point
The duke is very strangely gone from hence
Bore many gentlemen myself being one
In hand and hope of action but we do learn
By those that know the very nerves of state
His givings out were of an infinite distance
From his truemeant design Upon his place
And with full line of his authority
Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood
Is very snowbroth one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind study and fast
Heto give fear to use and liberty
Which have for long run by the hideous law
As mice by lionshath pickd out an act
Under whose heavy sense your brothers life
Falls into forfeit he arrests him on it
And follows close the rigour of the statute
To make him an example all hope is gone
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo and thats my pith
Of business twixt you and your poor brother

ISABELLA
Doth he so seek his life

LUCIO
Has censurd him
Already and as I hear the provost hath
A warrant for his execution

ISABELLA
Alas what poor abilitys in me
To do him good

LUCIO
Assay the power you have

ISABELLA
My power alas I doubt

LUCIO
Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt Go to Lord Angelo
And let him learn to know when maidens sue
Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them

ISABELLA
Ill see what I can do

LUCIO
But speedily

ISABELLA
I will about it straight
No longer staying but to give the Mother
Notice of my affair I humbly thank you
Commend me to my brother soon at night
Ill send him certain word of my success

LUCIO
I take my leave of you

ISABELLA
Good sir adieu

Exeunt



ACT II

Scene I A hall in ANGELOS house

Enter ANGELO ESCALUS a JUSTICE PROVOST Officers and other
Attendants

ANGELO
We must not make a scarecrow of the law
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey
And let it keep one shape till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror

ESCALUS
Ay but yet
Let us be keen and rather cut a little
Than fall and bruise to death Alas this gentleman
Whom I would save had a most noble father
Let but your honour know
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue
That in the working of your own affections
Had time coherd with place or place with wishing
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Could have attaind the effect of your own purpose
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Errd in this point which now you censure him
And pulld the law upon you

ANGELO
Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus
Another thing to fall I not deny
The jury passing on the prisoners life
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try Whats open made to justice
That justice seizes What knows the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves Tis very pregnant
The jewel that we find we stoop and take it
Because we see it but what we do not see
We tread upon and never think of it
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults but rather tell me
When I that censure him do so offend
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death
And nothing come in partial Sir he must die

ESCALUS
Be it as your wisdom will

ANGELO
Where is the provost

PROVOST
Here if it like your honour

ANGELO
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine tomorrow morning
Bring him his confessor let him be prepard

SERVANT
Hes hearing of a cause he will come straight

He hath but as offended in a dream
All sects all ages smack of this vice and he
To die for it

Enter ANGELO

ANGELO
Now whats the matter provost

PROVOST
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow

ANGELO
Did not I tell thee yea hadst thou not order
Why dost thou ask again

PROVOST
Lest I might be too rash
Under your good correction I have seen
When after execution judgment hath
Repented oer his doom

ANGELO
Go to let that be mine
Do you your office or give up your place
And you shall well be spared

PROVOST
I crave your honours pardon
What shall be done sir with the groaning Juliet
Shes very near her hour

ANGELO
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place and that with speed

Reenter Servant

SERVANT
Here is the sister of the man condemned
Desires access to you

ANGELO

PROVOST
Ay my good lord a very virtuous maid
And to be shortly of a sisterhood
If not already

ANGELO

Exit Servant

Let her have needful but not lavish means
There shall be order for it

Enter Lucio and ISABELLA

PROVOST
Offering to retire Save your honour

ANGELO
Stay a little while To ISABELLA You are welcome Whats
your will

ISABELLA
I am a woeful suitor to your honour
Please but your honour hear me

ANGELO
Well whats your suit

ISABELLA
There is a vice that most I do abhor
And most desire should meet the blow of justice
For which I would not plead but that I must
For which I must not plead but that I am
At war twixt will and will not

ANGELO
Well the matter

ISABELLA
I have a brother is condemnd to die
I do beseech you let it be his fault
And not my brother

PROVOST
Heaven give thee moving graces

ANGELO
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it
Why every faults condemnd ere it be done
Mine were the very cipher of a function
To find the faults whose fine stands in record
And let go by the actor

ISABELLA
O just but severe law
I had a brother thenHeaven keep your honour

Retiring

LUCIO
To ISABELLA Givet not oer so to him again entreat him
Kneel down before him hang upon his gown
You are too cold if you should need a pin
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it
To him I say

ISABELLA
Must he needs die

ANGELO
Maiden no remedy

ISABELLA
Yes I do think that you might pardon him
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy

ANGELO
I will not dot

ISABELLA
But can you if you would

ANGELO
Look what I will not that I cannot do

ISABELLA
But might you dot and do the world no wrong
If so your heart were touchd with that remorse
As mine is to him

ANGELO
Hes sentencd tis too late

LUCIO
To ISABELLA You are too cold

ISABELLA
Too late Why no I that do speak a word
May call it back again Well believe this
No ceremony that to great ones longs
Not the kings crown nor the deputed sword
The marshals truncheon nor the judges robe
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does
If he had been as you and you as he
You would have slippd like him
But he like you would not have been so stern

ANGELO
Pray you be gone

ISABELLA
I would to heaven I had your potency
And you were Isabel should it then be thus
No I would tell what twere to be a judge
And what a prisoner

LUCIO
Aside Ay touch him theres the vein

ANGELO
Your brother is a forfeit of the law
And you but waste your words

ISABELLA
Alas alas
Why all the souls that were were forfeit once
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy How would you be
If He which is the top of judgment should
But judge you as you are O think on that
And mercy then will breathe within your lips
Like man new made

ANGELO
Be you content fair maid
It is the law not I condemns your brother
Were he my kinsman brother or my son
It should be thus with himhe must die tomorrow

ISABELLA
Tomorrow O thats sudden Spare him spare him
Hes not prepared for death Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves Good good my lord bethink you
Who is it that hath died for this offence
Theres many have committed it

LUCIO
Ay well said

ANGELO
The law hath not been dead though it hath slept
Those many had not dared to do that evil
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answerd for his deed now tis awake
Takes note of what is done and like a prophet
Looks in a glass that shows what future evils
Either now or by remissness new conceivd
And so in progress to be hatchd and born
Are now to have no successive degrees
But where they live to end

ISABELLA
Yet show some pity

ANGELO
I show it most of all when I show justice
For then I pity those I do not know
Which a dismissd offence would after gall
And do him right that answering one foul wrong
Lives not to act another Be satisfied
Your brother dies tomorrow be content

ISABELLA
So you must be the first that gives this sentence
And he that suffers O it is excellent
To have a giants strength but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant

LUCIO
Thats well said

ISABELLA
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does Jove would neer be quiet
For every pelting petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder
Merciful Heaven
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle but man proud man
Dressd in a little brief authority
Most ignorant of what hes most assured
His glassy essencelike an angry ape
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As makes the angels weep who with our spleens
Would all themselves laugh mortal

LUCIO
O to him to him wench he will relent
Hes coming I perceive t

PROVOST
Pray heaven she win him

ISABELLA
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself
Great men may jest with saints tis wit in them
But in the less foul profanation

LUCIO
Thourt i the right girl more o that

ISABELLA
That in the captains but a choleric word
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy

LUCIO
Art advised o that more ont

ANGELO
Why do you put these sayings upon me

ISABELLA
Because authority though it err like others
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
That skins the vice o the top Go to your bosom
Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
Thats like my brothers fault if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brothers life

ANGELO
She speaks and tis
Such sense that my sense breeds with it
Fare you well

ISABELLA
Gentle my lord turn back

ANGELO
I will bethink meCome again tomorrow

ISABELLA
Hark how Ill bribe you Good my lord turn back

ANGELO
How bribe me

ISABELLA
Ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you

LUCIO
You had marrd all else

ISABELLA
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal

ANGELO
Well come to me
Tomorrow

LUCIO
Aside to ISABELLA Go to tis well away

ISABELLA
Heaven keep your honour safe

ANGELO
Aside Amen for I
Am that way going to temptation
Where prayers cross

ISABELLA
At what hour tomorrow
Shall I attend your lordship

ANGELO
At any time fore noon

ISABELLA
Save your honour

Exeunt LUCIO ISABELLA PROVOST

ANGELO
From thee even from thy virtue
Whats this whats this Is this her fault or mine
The tempter or the tempted who sins most Ha
Not she nor doth she tempt but it is I
That lying by the violet in the sun
Do as the carrion does not as the flower
Corrupt with virtuous season Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than womans lightness Having waste ground enough
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there O fie fie fie
What dost thou or what art thou Angelo
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good O let her brother live
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves What do I love her
That I desire to hear her speak again
And feast upon her eyes What ist I dream on
O cunning enemy that to catch a saint
With saints dost bait thy hook Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet
With all her double vigour art and nature
Once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quiteEver till now
When men were fond I smild and wonderd how

Exit



SCENE III A Room in a prison

Enter DUKE habited like a Friar and PROVOST

DUKE
Hail to you provost so I think you are

PROVOST
I am the provost Whats your will good friar

DUKE
Bound by my charity and my blessd order
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes that I may minister
To them accordingly

PROVOST
I would do more than that if more were needful

Enter JULIET

Look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine
Who falling in the flaws of her own youth
Hath blisterd her report She is with child
And he that got it sentencd a young man
More fit to do another such offence
Than die for this

DUKE
When must he die

PROVOST
As I do think tomorrow
To JULIET I have provided for you stay awhile
And you shall be conducted

DUKE
Repent you fair one of the sin you carry

JULIET
I do and bear the shame most patiently

DUKE
Ill teach you how you shall arraign your conscience
And try your penitence if it be sound
Or hollowly put on

JULIET
Ill gladly learn

DUKE
Love you the man that wrongd you

JULIET
Yes as I love the woman that wrongd him

DUKE
So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed

JULIET
Mutually

DUKE
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his

JULIET
I do confess it and repent it father

DUKE
Tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame
Which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it
But as we stand in fear

JULIET
I do repent me as it is an evil
And take the shame with joy

DUKE
There rest
Your partner as I hear must die tomorrow
And I am going with instruction to him
Grace go with you

DUKE
Benedicite

Exit

JULIET
Must die tomorrow O injurious law
That respites me a life whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror

PROVOST
Tis pity of him

Exeunt



SCENE IV A Room in ANGELOS house

Enter ANGELO

ANGELO
When I would pray and think I think and pray
To several subjects Heaven hath my empty words
Whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
Anchors on Isabel Heaven in my mouth
As if I did but only chew his name
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception The state whereon I studied
Is like a good thing being often read
Grown seard and tedious yea my gravity
Whereinlet no man hear meI take pride
Could I with boot change for an idle plume
Which the air beats for vain O place O form
How often dost thou with thy case thy habit
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming Blood thou art blood
Lets write good angel on the devils horn
Tis not the devils crest

Enter Servant

How now whos there

SERVANT
One Isabel a sister desires access to you

ANGELO
Teach her the way

Exit SERVANT

O heavens
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart
Making both it unable for itself
And dispossessing all the other parts
Of necessary fitness
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
Come all to help him and so stop the air
By which he should revive and even so
The general subject to a wellwished king
Quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence

Enter ISABELLA

How now fair maid

ISABELLA
I am come to know your pleasure

ANGELO
That you might know it would much better please me
Than to demand what tis Your brother cannot live

ISABELLA
Even soHeaven keep your honour

Retiring

ANGELO
Yet may he live awhile and it may be
As long as you or I yet he must die

ISABELLA
Under your sentence

ANGELO
Yea

ISABELLA
When I beseech you that in his reprieve
Longer or shorter he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not

ANGELO
Ha Fie these filthy vices It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image
In stamps that are forbid tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one

ISABELLA
Tis set down so in heaven but not in earth

ANGELO
Say you so then I shall pose you quickly
Which had you ratherthat the most just law
Now took your brothers life or to redeem him
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath staind

ISABELLA
Sir believe this
I had rather give my body than my soul

ANGELO
I talk not of your soul our compelld sins
Stand more for number than for accompt

ISABELLA
How say you

ANGELO
Nay Ill not warrant that for I can speak
Against the thing I say Answer to this
I now the voice of the recorded law
Pronounce a sentence on your brothers life
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brothers life

ISABELLA
Please you to dot
Ill take it as a peril to my soul
It is no sin at all but charity

ANGELO
Pleasd you to dot at peril of your soul
Were equal poise of sin and charity

ISABELLA
That I do beg his life if it be sin
Heaven let me bear it You granting of my suit
If that be sin Ill make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine
And nothing of your answer

ANGELO
Nay but hear me
Your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant
Or seem so craftily and thats not good

ISABELLA
Let me be ignorant and in nothing good
But graciously to know I am no better

ANGELO
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself as these black masks
Proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could displayedBut mark me
To be received plain Ill speak more gross
Your brother is to die

ISABELLA
So

ANGELO
And his offence is so as it appears
Accountant to the law upon that pain

ISABELLA
True

ANGELO
Admit no other way to save his life
As I subscribe not that nor any other
But in the loss of questionthat you his sister
Finding yourself desird of such a person
Whose credit with the judge or own great place
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the allbinding law and that there were
No earthly mean to save him but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposd or else to let him suffer
What would you do

ISABELLA
As much for my poor brother as myself
That is were I under the terms of death
The impression of keen whips Id wear as rubies
And strip myself to death as to a bed
That longing have been sick for ere Id yield
My body up to shame

ANGELO
Then must your brother die

ISABELLA
And twere the cheaper way
Better it were a brother died at once
Than that a sister by redeeming him
Should die for ever

ANGELO
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slandered so

ISABELLA
Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption

ANGELO
You seemd of late to make the law a tyrant
And rather provd the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice

ISABELLA
O pardon me my lord It oft falls out
To have what we would have we speak not what we mean
I something do excuse the thing I hate
For his advantage that I dearly love

ANGELO
We are all frail

ISABELLA
Else let my brother die
If not a feodary but only he
Owe and succeed by weakness

ANGELO
Nay women are frail too

ISABELLA
Ay as the glasses where they view themselves
Which are as easy broke as they make forms
Women Help heaven men their creation mar
In profiting by them Nay call us ten times frail
For we are soft as our complexions are
And credulous to false prints

ANGELO
I think it well
And from this testimony of your own sex
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frameslet me be bold
I do arrest your words Be that you are
That is a woman if you be more youre none
If you be oneas you are well expressd
By all external warrantsshow it now
By putting on the destind livery

ISABELLA
I have no tongue but one gentle my lord
Let me intreat you speak the former language

ANGELO
Plainly conceive I love you

ISABELLA
My brother did love Juliet and you tell me
That he shall die for it

ANGELO
He shall not Isabel if you give me love

ISABELLA
I know your virtue hath a license int
Which seems a little fouler than it is
To pluck on others

ANGELO
Believe me on mine honour
My words express my purpose

ISABELLA
Ha little honour to be much believed
And most pernicious purposeSeeming seeming
I will proclaim thee Angelo look fort
Sign me a present pardon for my brother
Or with an outstretchd throat Ill tell the world
Aloud what man thou art

ANGELO
Who will believe thee Isabel
My unsoild name th austereness of my life
My vouch against you and my place i the state
Will so your accusation overweigh
That you shall stifle in your own report
And smell of calumny I have begun
And now I give my sensual race the rein
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
That banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will
Or else he must not only die the death
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance answer me tomorrow
Or by the affection that now guides me most
Ill prove a tyrant to him As for you
Say what you can my false oerweighs your true

Exit

ISABELLA
To whom should I complain Did tell this
Who would believe me O perilous mouths
That bear in them one and the selfsame tongue
Either of condemnation or approof
Bidding the law make courtsy to their will
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite
To follow as it draws Ill to my brother
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
That had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks hed yield them up
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorrd pollution
Then Isabel live chaste and brother die
More than our brother is our chastity
Ill tell him yet of Angelos request
And fit his mind to death for his souls rest

Exit

Enter DUKE CLAUDIO and PROVOST

DUKE
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo

CLAUDIO
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope
I have hope to live and am prepard to die

DUKE
Be absolute for death either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter Reason thus with life
If I do lose thee I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep a breath thou art
Servile to all the skiey influences
That dost this habitation where thou keepst
Hourly afflict merey thou art deaths fool
For him thou labourst by thy flight to shun
And yet runnst toward him still Thou art not noble
For all the accommodations that thou bearst
Are nursd by baseness Thou art by no means valiant
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm Thy best of rest is sleep
And that thou oft provokst yet grossly fearst
Thy death which is no more Thou art not thyself
For thou existst on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust Happy thou art not
For what thou hast not still thou strivst to get
And what thou hast forgettst Thou art not certain
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects
After the moon If thou art rich thou art poor
For like an ass whose back with ingots bows
Thou bearst thy heavy riches but a journey
And death unloads thee Friend hast thou none
For thine own bowels which do call thee sire
The mere effusion of thy proper loins
Do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
For ending thee no sooner Thou hast nor youth nor age
But as it were an afterdinners sleep
Dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
Thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
To make thy riches pleasant Whats yet in this
That bears the name of life Yet in this life
Lie hid more thousand deaths yet death we fear
That makes these odds all even

CLAUDIO
I humbly thank you
To sue to live I find I seek to die
And seeking death find life Let it come on

ISABELLA
Within What ho Peace here grace and good company

PROVOST
Whos there come in the wish deserves a welcome

DUKE
Dear sir ere long Ill visit you again

CLAUDIO
Most holy sir I thank you

Enter ISABELLA

ISABELLA
My business is a word or two with Claudio

PROVOST
And very welcome Look signior heres your sister

DUKE
Provost a word with you

PROVOST
As many as you please

DUKE
Bring me to hear them speak where I may be conceald

Exeunt DUKE and PROVOST

CLAUDIO
Now sister whats the comfort

ISABELLA
Why
As all comforts are most good most good in deed
Lord Angelo having affairs to heaven
Intends you for his swift ambassador
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger
Therefore your best appointment make with speed
Tomorrow you set on

CLAUDIO
Is there no remedy

ISABELLA
None but such remedy as to save a head
To cleave a heart in twain

CLAUDIO
But is there any

ISABELLA
Yes brother you may live
There is a devilish mercy in the judge
If youll implore it that will free your life
But fetter you till death

CLAUDIO
Perpetual durance

ISABELLA
Ay just perpetual durance a restraint
Though all the worlds vastidity you had
To a determind scope

CLAUDIO
But in what nature

ISABELLA
In such a one as you consenting tot
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
And leave you naked

CLAUDIO
Let me know the point

ISABELLA
O I do fear thee Claudio and I quake
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour Darst thou die
The sense of death is most in apprehension
And the poor beetle that we tread upon
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies

CLAUDIO
Why give you me this shame
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flowery tenderness If I must die
I will encounter darkness as a bride
And hug it in mine arms

ISABELLA
There spake my brother there my fathers grave
Did utter forth a voice Yes thou must die
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances This outwardsainted deputy
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowlis yet a devil
His filth within being cast he would appear
A pond as deep as hell

CLAUDIO
The precise Angelo

ISABELLA
O tis the cunning livery of hell
The damnedst body to invest and cover
In precise guards Dost thou think Claudio
If I would yield him my virginity
Thou mightst be freed

CLAUDIO
O heavens it cannot be

ISABELLA
Yes he would give it thee from this rank offence
So to offend him still This nights the time
That I should do what I abhor to name
Or else thou diest tomorrow

CLAUDIO
Thou shalt not dot

ISABELLA
O were it but my life
Id throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin

CLAUDIO
Thanks dear Isabel

ISABELLA
Be ready Claudio for your death tomorrow

CLAUDIO
YesHas he affections in him
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose
When he would force it Sure it is no sin
Or of the deadly seven it is the least

ISABELLA
Which is the least

CLAUDIO
If it were damnable he being so wise
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably finedO Isabel

ISABELLA
What says my brother

CLAUDIO
Death is a fearful thing

ISABELLA
And shamed life a hateful

CLAUDIO
Ay but to die and go we know not where
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods or to reside
In thrilling regions of thickribbed ice
To be imprisond in the viewless winds
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howlingtis too horrible
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age ache penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death

ISABELLA
Alas alas

CLAUDIO
Sweet sister let me live
What sin you do to save a brothers life
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue

ISABELLA
O you beast
O faithless coward O dishonest wretch
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
Ist not a kind of incest to take life
From thine own sisters shame What should I think
Heaven shield my mother playd my father fair
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Neer issued from his blood Take my defiance
Die perish might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed
Ill pray a thousand prayers for thy death
No word to save thee

CLAUDIO
Nay hear me Isabel

ISABELLA
O fie fie fie
Thy sins not accidental but a trade
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
Tis best that thou diest quickly

Going

CLAUDIO
O hear me Isabella

Reenter DUKE

DUKE
Vouchsafe a word young sister but one word

ISABELLA
What is your will

DUKE
Might you dispense with your leisure I would by and by have
some speech with you the satisfaction I would require is
likewise your own benefit

ISABELLA
I have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of
other affairs but I will attend you awhile

DUKE
To CLAUDIO aside Son I have overheard what hath passed
between you and your sister Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to
practise his judgment with the disposition of natures she
having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious
denial which he is most glad to receive I am confessor to
Angelo and I know this to be true therefore prepare yourself
to death Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are
fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready

CLAUDIO
Let me ask my sister pardon I am so out of love with life that I
will sue to be rid of it

DUKE
Hold you there Farewell

Exit CLAUDIO

Reenter PROVOST

Provost a word with you

PROVOST
Whats your will father

DUKE
That now you are come you will be gone Leave me a while with
the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her
by my company

PROVOST
In good time

Exit PROVOST

DUKE
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness
that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace
being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever
fair The assault that Angelo hath made to you fortune hath
conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples
for his falling I should wonder at Angelo How will you do to
content this substitute and to save your brother

ISABELLA
I am now going to resolve him I had rather my brother die by the
law than my son should be unlawfully born But O how much is the
good duke deceived in Angelo If ever he return and I can speak
to him I will open my lips in vain or discover his government

DUKE
That shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he
will avoid your accusation he made trial of you onlyTherefore
fasten your ear on my advisings to the love I have in doing good
a remedy presents itself I do make myself believe that you may
most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit
redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own
gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure
he shall ever return to have hearing of this business

ISABELLA
Let me hear you speak further I have spirit to do anything that
appears not foul in the truth of my spirit

DUKE
Virtue is bold and goodness never fearful Have you not heard
speak of Mariana the sister of Frederick the great soldier who
miscarried at sea

ISABELLA
I have heard of the lady and good words went with her name

DUKE
She should this Angelo have married was affianced to her by
oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the
contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was
wrecked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman
there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward
her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of
her fortune her marriagedowry with both her combinate husband
this wellseeming Angelo

ISABELLA
Can this be so Did Angelo so leave her

DUKE
Left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his
comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her
discoveries of dishonour in few bestowd her on her own
lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a
marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not

ISABELLA
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the
world What corruption in this life that it will let this man
liveBut how out of this can she avail

DUKE
It is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not
only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it

ISABELLA
Show me how good father

DUKE
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first
affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have
quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made
it more violent and unruly Go you to Angelo answer his requiring
with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point
only refer yourself to this advantagefirst that your stay with
him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence
in it and the place answer to convenience this being granted in
course and now follows all We shall advise this wronged maid to
stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense
and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted
the poor Mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled The
maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt If you think well
to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends
the deceit from reproof What think you of it

ISABELLA
The image of it gives me content already and I trust it will
grow to a most prosperous perfection

DUKE
It lies much in your holding up Haste you speedily to Angelo if
for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of
satisfaction I will presently to Saint Lukes there at the
moated grange resides this dejected Mariana At that place call
upon me and despatch with Angelo that it may be quickly

ISABELLA
I thank you for this comfort Fare you well good father

Exeunt severally


Scene II The Street before the Prison

Enter DUKE as a Friar to him ELBOW CLOWN and Officers

ELBOW
Nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will needs buy
and sell men and women like beasts we shall have all the world

DUKE

CLOWN

to keep him warm and furred with fox on lambskins too to
signify that craft being richer than innocency stands for the
facing

ELBOW
Come your way sirBless you good father friar

DUKE

a thief too sir for we have found upon him sir a strange
picklock which we have sent to the deputy

DUKE
Fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd
The evil that thou causest to be done
That is thy means to live Do thou but think
What tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice say to thyself
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink I eat array myself and live
Canst thou believe thy living is a life
So stinkingly depending Go mend go mend

CLOWN
Indeed it does stink in some sort sir but yet sir I would
prove

DUKE
Nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin
Thou wilt prove his Take him to prison officer
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit

ELBOW
He must before the deputy sir he has given him warning
The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster if he be a whoremaster
and comes before him he were as good go a mile on his errand

DUKE
That we were all as some would seem to be
Free from our faults as faults from seeming free

ELBOW
His neck will come to your waist a cord sir

CLOWN
I spy comfort I cry bail Heres a gentleman and a friend of
mine

Enter LUCIO

LUCIO
How now noble Pompey What at the wheels of Caesar Art thou
led in triumph What is there none of Pygmalions images newly
made woman to be had now for putting the hand in the pocket
and extracting it clutched What reply ha What sayst thou to
this tune matter and method Ist not drowned i the last rain
ha What sayst thou tot Is the world as it was man Which
is the way Is it sad and few words or how The trick of it

DUKE
Still thus and thus still worse

LUCIO
How doth my dear morsel thy mistress Procures she still ha

CLOWN
Troth sir she hath eaten up all her beef and she is herself in
the tub

LUCIO
Why tis good it is the right of it it must be so ever your
fresh whore and your powdered bawdan unshunned consequence

LUCIO

Exeunt ELBOW CLOWN and Officers

What news friar of the duke

DUKE
I know none Can you tell me of any

LUCIO
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia other some he is in
Rome but where is he think you

DUKE
I know not where but wheresoever I wish him well

LUCIO
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and
usurp the beggary he was never born to Lord Angelo dukes it well
in his absence he puts transgression tot

DUKE
He does well int

LUCIO
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him
something too crabbed that way friar

DUKE
It is too general a vice and severity must cure it

LUCIO
Yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well
allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till
eating and drinking be put down They say this Angelo was not
made by man and woman after this downright way of creation
is it true think you

DUKE
How should he be made then

LUCIO
Some report a seamaid spawned him some that he was begot
between two stockfishesBut it is certain that when he makes
water his urine is congealed ice that I know to be true And
he is a motion ungenerative thats infallible

DUKE
You are pleasant sir and speak apace

LUCIO
Why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a
codpiece to take away the life of a man Would the duke that is
absent have done this Ere he would have hanged a man for the
getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a
thousand He had some feeling of the sport he knew the service
and that instructed him to mercy

DUKE
I never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not
inclined that way

LUCIO
O sir you are deceived

DUKE
Tis not possible

LUCIO
Who not the duke yes your beggar of fiftyand his use was to
put a ducat in her clackdish the duke had crotchets in him
He would be drunk too that let me inform you

DUKE
You do him wrong surely

LUCIO
Sir I was an inward of his A shy fellow was the duke and I
believe I know the cause of his withdrawing

DUKE
What I prythee might be the cause

LUCIO
Nopardontis a secret must be locked within the teeth and
the lips but this I can let you understandthe greater file of
the subject held the duke to be wise

DUKE
Wise why no question but he was

LUCIO
A very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow

DUKE
Either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream
of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a
warranted need give him a better proclamation Let him be but
testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to
the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier Therefore you
speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much
darkened in your malice

LUCIO
Sir I know him and I love him

DUKE
Love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love


LUCIO
Come sir I know what I know

DUKE
I can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak
But if ever the duke returnas our prayers are he may
let me desire you to make your answer before him If it be
honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it I am
bound to call upon you and I pray you your name

LUCIO
Sir my name is Lucio well known to the duke

DUKE
He shall know you better sir if I may live to report you

LUCIO
I fear you not

DUKE
O you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too
unhurtful an opposite But indeed I can do you little harm
youll forswear this again

LUCIO
Ill be hanged first thou art deceived in me friar But no
more of this Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow or no

DUKE
Why should he die sir

LUCIO
Why for filling a bottle with a tundish I would the duke we
talk of were returned again this ungenitured agent will
unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build
in his houseeaves because they are lecherous The duke yet
would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them
to light would he were returned Marry this Claudio is
condemned for untrussing Farewell good friar I prythee pray
for me The duke I say to thee again would eat mutton on
Fridays Hes not past it yet and I say to thee he would
mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic
Say that I said soFarewell

Exit

DUKE
No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure scape backwounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue
But who comes here

Enter ESCALUS PROVOST BAWD and Officers

ESCALUS
Go away with her to prison

BAWD
Good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted a merciful
man good my lord

ESCALUS
Double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind
This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant

PROVOST
A bawd of eleven years continuance may it please your honour

BAWD
My lord this is one Lucios information against me Mistress
Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the dukes time he
promised her marriage his child is a year and a quarter old
come Philip and Jacob I have kept it myself and see how he
goes about to abuse me

ESCALUS
That fellow is a fellow of much licenselet him be called
before usAway with her to prison Go to no more words

Exeunt BAWD and Officers

Provost my brother Angelo will not be altered Claudio must die
tomorrow let him be furnished with divines and have all
charitable preparation if my brother wrought by my pity it
should not be so with him

PROVOST
So please you this friar hath been with him and advised him for
the entertainment of death

ESCALUS
Good even good father

DUKE
Bliss and goodness on you

ESCALUS
Of whence are you

DUKE
Not of this country though my chance is now
To use it for my time I am a brother
Of gracious order late come from the see
In special business from his holiness

ESCALUS
What news abroad i the world

DUKE
None but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the
dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and
as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is
virtuous to be constant in any undertaking There is scarce truth
enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to
make fellowships accurst much upon this riddle runs the wisdom
of the world This news is old enough yet it is every days news
I pray you sir of what disposition was the duke

ESCALUS
One that above all other strifes contended especially to know
himself

DUKE
What pleasure was he given to

ESCALUS
Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at anything
which professed to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance
But leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove
prosperous and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared I am made to understand that you have lent him
visitation

DUKE
He professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge
but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of
justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his
frailty many deceiving promises of life which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him and now he is resolved to die

ESCALUS
You have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the
very debt of your calling I have laboured for the poor gentleman
to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have
I found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed
justice

DUKE
If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall
become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced
himself

ESCALUS
I am going to visit the prisoner
Fare you well

DUKE
Peace be with you

Exeunt ESCALUS and PROVOST

He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe
Pattern in himself to know
Grace to stand and virtue go
More nor less to others paying
Than by selfoffences weighing
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking
Twice treble shame on Angelo
To weed my vice and let his grow
O what may man within him hide
Though angel on the outward side
How may likeness made in crimes
Make a practice on the times
To draw with idle spiders strings
Most pondrous and substantial things
Craft against vice I must apply
With Angelo tonight shall lie
His old betrothed but despisd
So disguise shall by the disguisd
Pay with falsehood false exacting
And perform an old contracting

Exit



Act IV

Scene I A Room in Marianas House

MARIANA discovered sitting a Boy singing

 SONG
 Take O take those lips away
 That so sweetly were forsworn
 And those eyes the break of day
 Lights that do mislead the morn
 But my kisses bring again
 Bring again
 Seals of love but seald in vain
 Sealed in vain

MARIANA
Break off thy song and haste thee quick away
Here comes a man of comfort whose advice
Hath often stilld my brawling discontent

Exit BOY
Enter DUKE

I cry you mercy sir and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical
Let me excuse me and believe me so
My mirth it much displeasd but pleasd my woe

DUKE
Tis good though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good and good provoke to harm
I pray you tell me hath anybody inquired for me here today
much upon this time have I promised here to meet

MARIANA
You have not been inquired after I have sat here all day

Enter ISABELLA

DUKE

Exit

DUKE
Very well met and welcome
What is the news from this good deputy

ISABELLA
He hath a garden circummurd with brick
Whose western side is with a vineyard backd
And to that vineyard is a planched gate
That makes his opening with this bigger key
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads
There have I made my promise to call on him
Upon the heavy middle of the night

DUKE
But shall you on your knowledge find this way

ISABELLA
I have taen a due and wary note upont
With whispering and most guilty diligence
In action all of precept he did show me
The way twice oer

DUKE
Are there no other tokens
Between you greed concerning her observance

ISABELLA
No none but only a repair i the dark
And that I have possessd him my most stay
Can be but brief for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along
That stays upon me whose persuasion is
I come about my brother

DUKE
Tis well borne up
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of thisWhat ho within come forth

Reenter MARIANA

I pray you be acquainted with this maid
She comes to do you good

ISABELLA
I do desire the like

DUKE
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you

MARIANA
Good friar I know you do and have found it

DUKE
Take then this your companion by the hand
Who hath a story ready for your ear
I shall attend your leisure but make haste
The vaporous night approaches

MARIANA
Willt please you walk aside

Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA

DUKE
O place and greatness millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quest
Upon thy doings Thousand scapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dream
And rack thee in their fanciesWelcome how agreed

Reenter MARIANA and ISABELLA

ISABELLA
Shell take the enterprise upon her father
If you advise it

DUKE
It is not my consent
But my entreaty too

ISABELLA
Little have you to say
When you depart from him but soft and low
Remember now my brother

MARIANA
Fear me not

DUKE
Nor gentle daughter fear you not at all
He is your husband on a precontract
To bring you thus together tis no sin
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit Come let us go
Our corns to reap for yet our tithes to sow

Exeunt



SCENE II A Room in the prison

Tomorrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine Here is in
our prison a common executioner who in his office lacks a helper
if you will take it on you to assist him it shall redeem you from
your gyves if not you shall have your full time of imprisonment
and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping for you have been
a notorious bawd

you have but that you have a hanging lookdo you call sir
your occupation a mystery

ABHORSON
Ay sir a mystery

CLOWN
Painting sir I have heard say is a mystery and your whores
sir being members of my occupation using painting do prove
my occupation a mystery but what mystery there should be in
hanging if I should be hanged I cannot imagine

ABHORSON
Sir it is a mystery

CLOWN

ABHORSON
Every true mans apparel fits your thief if it be too little for
your thief your true man thinks it big enough if it be too big
for your thief your thief thinks it little enough so every true
mans apparel fits your thief

Reenter PROVOST

PROVOST
Are you agreed

I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle ClaudioWelcome father

Enter DUKE

DUKE
The best and wholesomst spirits of the night
Envelop you good provost Who calld here of late

PROVOST
None since the curfew rung

DUKE
Not Isabel

PROVOST
No

DUKE
They will then eret be long

PROVOST
What comfort is for Claudio

DUKE
Theres some in hope

PROVOST
It is a bitter deputy

DUKE
Not so not so his life is paralleld
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others were he meald
With that which he corrects then were he tyrannous
But this being so hes justNow are they come

Knocking withinPROVOST goes out

This is a gentle provost seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men
How now what noise That spirits possessd with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes

PROVOST returns speaking to one at the door

PROVOST
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in he is calld up

DUKE
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet
But he must die tomorrow

PROVOST
None sir none

DUKE
As near the dawning Provost as it is
You shall hear more ere morning

PROVOST
Happily
You something know yet I believe there comes
No countermand no such example have we
Besides upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Professd the contrary

Enter a Messenger

DUKE
This is his lordships man

DUKE
And here comes Claudios pardon

MESSENGER
My lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge
that you swerve not from the smallest article of it neither in
time matter or other circumstance Good morrow for as I take
it it is almost day

PROVOST
I shall obey him

Exit Messenger

DUKE
Aside This is his pardon purchasd by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in
Hence hath offence his quick celerity
When it is borne in high authority
When vice makes mercy mercys so extended
That for the faults love is the offender friended
Now sir what news

PROVOST
I told you Lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine
office awakens me with this unwonted puttingon methinks
strangely for he hath not used it before

DUKE
Pray you lets hear

PROVOST
Reads Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let Claudio be
executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon Barnardine
for my better satisfaction let me have Claudios head sent me by
five Let this be duly performed with a thought that more
depends on it than we must yet deliver Thus fail not to do your
office as you will answer it at your peril
What say you to this sir

DUKE
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon

PROVOST
A Bohemian born but here nursed up and bred one that is a
prisoner nine years old

DUKE
How came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to
his liberty or executed him I have heard it was ever his manner
to do so

PROVOST
His friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his
fact till now in the government of Lord Angelo came not to an
undoubtful proof

DUKE
It is now apparent

PROVOST
Most manifest and not denied by himself

DUKE
Hath he borne himself penitently in prison How seems he to be
touched

PROVOST
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken
sleep careless reckless and fearless of whats past present
or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal

DUKE
He wants advice

PROVOST
He will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the
prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many
times aday if not many days entirely drunk We have very oft
awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a
seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all

DUKE
More of him anon There is written in your brow Provost honesty
and constancy if I read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me
but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard
Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater
forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenced him To make you
understand this in a manifested effect I crave but four days
respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy

PROVOST
Pray sir in what

DUKE
In the delaying death

PROVOST
Alack How may I do it having the hour limited and an express
command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of Angelo
I may make my case as Claudios to cross this in the smallest

DUKE
By the vow of mine order I warrant you if my instructions may
be your guide Let this Barnardine be this morning executed
and his head borne to Angelo

PROVOST
Angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour

DUKE
O deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it Shave the
head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent
to be so bared before his death You know the course is common
If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good
fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead against it with
my life

PROVOST
Pardon me good father it is against my oath

DUKE
Were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy

PROVOST
To him and to his substitutes

DUKE
You will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the
justice of your dealing

PROVOST
But what likelihood is in that

DUKE
Not a resemblance but a certainty Yet since I see you fearful
that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease
attempt you I will go further than I meant to pluck all fears
out of you Look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke
You know the character I doubt not and the signet is not
strange to you

PROVOST
I know them both

DUKE
The contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon
overread it at your pleasure where you shall find within these
two days he will be here This is a thing that Angelo knows not
for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour perchance
of the dukes death perchance entering into some monastery but
by chance nothing of what is writ Look the unfolding star calls
up the shepherd Put not yourself into amazement how these things
should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known Call
your executioner and off with Barnardines head I will give him
a present shrift and advise him for a better place Yet you are
amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you Come away it is
almost clear dawn

Exeunt

After him fellows bring him to the block

Exeunt ABHORSON and CLOWN

Enter PROVOST

PROVOST
Now sir how do you find the prisoner

DUKE
A creature unprepard unmeet for death
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable

PROVOST
Here in the prison father
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine a most notorious pirate
A man of Claudios years his beard and head
Just of his colour What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine more like to Claudio

DUKE
O tis an accident that Heaven provides
Despatch it presently the hour draws on
Prefixd by Angelo see this be done
And sent according to command whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die

PROVOST
This shall be done good father presently
But Barnardine must die this afternoon
And how shall we continue Claudio
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive

DUKE
Let this be done
Put them in secret holds both Barnardine and Claudio
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation you shall find
Your safety manifested

PROVOST
I am your free dependant

DUKE
Quick dispatch and send the head to Angelo

Exit PROVOST

Now will I write letters to Angelo
The provost he shall bear themwhose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home
And that by great injunctions I am bound
To enter publicly him Ill desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city and from thence
By cold gradation and wellbalanced form
We shall proceed with Angelo

Reenter PROVOST

PROVOST
Here is the head Ill carry it myself

DUKE
Convenient is it Make a swift return
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours

PROVOST
Ill make all speed

Exit

ISABELLA
Within Peace ho be here

DUKE
The tongue of IsabelShes come to know
If yet her brothers pardon be come hither

To make her heavenly comforts of despair
When it is least expected

Enter ISABELLA

ISABELLA
Ho by your leave

DUKE
Good morning to you fair and gracious daughter

ISABELLA
The better given me by so holy a man
Hath yet the deputy sent my brothers pardon

DUKE
He hath released him Isabel from the world
His head is off and sent to Angelo

ISABELLA
Nay but it is not so

DUKE
It is no other
Show your wisdom daughter in your close patience

ISABELLA
O I will to him and pluck out his eyes

DUKE
You shall not be admitted to his sight

ISABELLA
Unhappy Claudio Wretched Isabel
Injurious world Most damned Angelo

DUKE
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot
Forbear it therefore give your cause to Heaven
Mark what I say which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity
The duke comes home tomorrownay dry your eyes
One of our convent and his confessor
Gives me this instance Already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates
There to give up their power If you can pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch
Grace of the duke revenges to your heart
And general honour

ISABELLA
I am directed by you

DUKE
This letter then to Friar Peter give
Tis that he sent me of the dukes return
Say by this token I desire his company
At Marianas house tonight Her cause and yours
Ill perfect him withal and he shall bring you
Before the duke and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home For my poor self
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent Wend you with this letter
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart trust not my holy order
If I pervert your courseWhos here

Enter LUCIO

LUCIO

By my troth Isabel I loved thy brother If the old fantastical
duke of dark corners had been at home he had lived

Exit ISABELLA

DUKE

woodman than thou takest him for

DUKE

LUCIO

DUKE

LUCIO
I was once before him for getting a wench with child

DUKE

LUCIO
Yes marry did I but I was fain to forswear it they would else

DUKE

LUCIO
By my troth Ill go with thee to the lanes end If bawdy talk
offend you well have very little of it Nay friar I am a kind
of burr I shall stick

Exeunt



SCENE IV A Room in ANGELOS house

Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS

ESCALUS
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other

ANGELO
In most uneven and distracted manner His actions show much like
to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted And why meet him
at the gates and redeliver our authorities there

ESCALUS
I guess not

ANGELO
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering
that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit
their petitions in the street

ESCALUS
He shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of complaints
and to deliver us from devices hereafter which shall then have
no power to stand against us

ANGELO
Well I beseech you let it be proclaimd
Betimes i the morn Ill call you at your house
Give notice to such men of sort and suit
As are to meet him

ESCALUS
I shall sir fare you well

Exit

ANGELO
Good night
This deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings A deflowerd maid
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against itBut that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss
How might she tongue me Yet reason dares herno
For my authority bears a so credent bulk
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather He should have livd
Save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense
Might in the times to come have taen revenge
By so receiving a dishonourd life
With ransom of such shame Would yet he had livd
Alack when once our grace we have forgot
Nothing goes right we would and we would not

Exit



SCENE V Fields without the town

Enter DUKE in his own habit and Friar PETER

DUKE
These letters at fit time deliver me Giving letters
The provost knows our purpose and our plot
The matter being afoot keep your instruction
And hold you ever to our special drift
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
As cause doth minister Go call at Flavius house
And tell him where I stay give the like notice
To Valentinus Rowland and to Crassus
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate
But send me Flavius first

PETER
It shall be speeded well

Exit FRIAR

Enter VARRIUS

DUKE
I thank thee Varrius thou hast made good haste
Come we will walk Theres other of our friends
Will greet us here anon my gentle Varrius

Exeunt



SCENE VI Street near the City Gate

Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA

ISABELLA
To speak so indirectly I am loath
I would say the truth but to accuse him so
That is your part yet I am advisd to do it
He says to vailfull purpose

MARIANA
Be ruled by him

ISABELLA
Besides he tells me that if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side
I should not think it strange for tis a physic
Thats bitter to sweet end

MARIANA
I would Friar Peter

ISABELLA
O peace the friar is come

Enter FRIAR PETER

PETER
Come I have found you out a stand most fit
Where you may have such vantage on the duke
He shall not pass you Twice have the trumpets sounded
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates and very near upon
The duke is entering therefore hence away

Exeunt



ACT V

SCENE I A public place near the city gate

MARIANA veiled ISABELLA and PETER at a distance Enter at
opposite doors DUKE VARRIUS Lords ANGELO ESCALUS LUCIO
PROVOST Officers and Citizens

DUKE
My very worthy cousin fairly met
Our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you

ANGELO and ESCALUS
Happy return be to your royal grace

DUKE
Many and hearty thankings to you both
We have made inquiry of you and we hear
Such goodness of your justice that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks
Forerunning more requital

ANGELO
You make my bonds still greater

DUKE
O your desert speaks loud and I should wrong it
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom
When it deserves with characters of brass
A forted residence gainst the tooth of time
And rasure of oblivion Give me your hand
And let the subject see to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep withinCome Escalus
You must walk by us on our other hand
And good supporters are you

Enter PETER and ISABELLA come forward

PETER
Now is your time speak loud and kneel before him

ISABELLA
Justice O royal duke Vail your regard
Upon a wrongd Id fain have said a maid
O worthy prince dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice justice justice justice

DUKE
Relate your wrongs In what By whom Be brief
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice
Reveal yourself to him

ISABELLA
O worthy duke
You bid me seek redemption of the devil
Hear me yourself for that which I must speak
Must either punish me not being believd
Or wring redress from you hear me O hear me here

ANGELO
My lord her wits I fear me are not firm
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice

ISABELLA
By course of justice

ANGELO
And she will speak most bitterly and strange

ISABELLA
Most strange but yet most truly will I speak
That Angelos forsworn is it not strange
That Angelos a murderer ist not strange
That Angelo is an adulterous thief
An hypocrite a virginviolator
Is it not strange and strange

DUKE
Nay it is ten times strange

ISABELLA
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange
Nay it is ten times true for truth is truth
To the end of reckoning

DUKE
Away with herPoor soul
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense

ISABELLA
O prince I conjure thee as thou believst
There is another comfort than this world
That thou neglect me not with that opinion
That I am touchd with madness make not impossible
That which but seems unlike tis not impossible
But one the wickedst caitiff on the ground
May seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
As Angelo even so may Angelo
In all his dressings characts titles forms
Be an archvillain believe it royal prince
If he be less hes nothing but hes more
Had I more name for badness

DUKE
By mine honesty
If she be mad as I believe no other
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
Such a dependency of thing on thing
As eer I heard in madness

ISABELLA
O gracious duke
Harp not on that nor do not banish reason
For inequality but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid
And hide the false seems true

DUKE
Many that are not mad
Have sure more lack of reasonWhat would you say

ISABELLA
I am the sister of one Claudio
Condemnd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head condemnd by Angelo
I in probation of a sisterhood
Was sent to by my brother one Lucio
As then the messenger

LUCIO
Thats I ant like your grace
I came to her from Claudio and desird her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brothers pardon

ISABELLA
Thats he indeed

DUKE
You were not bid to speak

LUCIO
No my good lord
Nor wishd to hold my peace

DUKE
I wish you now then
Pray you take note of it and when you have
A business for yourself pray Heaven you then
Be perfect

LUCIO
I warrant your honour

DUKE
The warrants for yourself take heed to it

ISABELLA
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale

LUCIO
Right

DUKE
It may be right but you are in the wrong
To speak before your timeProceed

ISABELLA
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy

DUKE
Thats somewhat madly spoken

ISABELLA
Pardon it
The phrase is to the matter

DUKE
Mended again The matterproceed

ISABELLA
In briefto set the needless process by
How I persuaded how I prayd and kneeld
How he refelld me and how I replied
For this was of much lengththe vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter
He would not but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust
Release my brother and after much debatement
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
And I did yield to him But the next morn betimes
His purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
For my poor brothers head

DUKE
This is most likely

ISABELLA
O that it were as like as it is true

DUKE
By heaven fond wretch thou knowst not what thou speakst
Or else thou art subornd against his honour
In hateful practice First his integrity
Stands without blemishnext it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself if he had so offended
He would have weighd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off Some one hath set you on
Confess the truth and say by whose advice
Thou camst here to complain

ISABELLA
And is this all
Then O you blessed ministers above
Keep me in patience and with ripend time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenanceHeaven shield your grace from woe
As I thus wrongd hence unbelieved go

DUKE
I know youd fain be goneAn officer
To prison with herShall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us This needs must be a practice
Who knew of your intent and coming hither

ISABELLA
One that I would were here Friar Lodowick

DUKE
A ghostly father belike Who knows that Lodowick

LUCIO
My lord I know him tis a meddling friar
I do not like the man had he been lay my lord
For certain words he spake against your grace
In your retirement I had swingd him soundly

DUKE
Words against me Thiss a good friar belike
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substituteLet this friar be found

LUCIO
But yesternight my lord she and that friar
I saw them at the prison a saucy friar
A very scurvy fellow

PETER
Blessd be your royal grace
I have stood by my lord and I have heard
Your royal ear abusd First hath this woman
Most wrongfully accusd your substitute
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot

DUKE
We did believe no less
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of

PETER
I know him for a man divine and holy
Not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
As hes reported by this gentleman
And on my trust a man that never yet
Did as he vouches misreport your grace

LUCIO
My lord most villainously believe it

PETER
Well he in time may come to clear himself
But at this instant he is sick my lord
Of a strange fever Upon his mere request
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended gainst Lord Angelocame I hither
To speak as from his mouth what he doth know
Is true and false and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear
Whensoever hes convented First for this woman
To justify this worthy nobleman
So vulgarly and personally accusd
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
Till she herself confess it

DUKE
Good friar lets hear it

ISABELLA is carried off guarded and MARIANA comes forward

Do you not smile at this Lord Angelo
O heaven the vanity of wretched fools
Give us some seatsCome cousin Angelo
In this Ill be impartial be you judge
Of your own causeIs this the witness friar
First let her show her face and after speak

MARIANA
Pardon my lord I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me

DUKE
What are you married

MARIANA
No my lord

DUKE
Are you a maid

MARIANA
No my lord

DUKE
A widow then

MARIANA
Neither my lord

DUKE
Why you are nothing thenneither maid widow nor wife

LUCIO
My lord she may be a punk for many of them are neither maid
widow nor
wife

DUKE
Silence that fellow I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself

LUCIO
Well my lord

MARIANA
My lord I do confess I neer was married
And I confess besides I am no maid
I have known my husband yet my husband knows not
That ever he knew me

LUCIO
He was drunk then my lord it can be no better

DUKE
For the benefit of silence would thou wert so too

LUCIO
Well my lord

DUKE
This is no witness for Lord Angelo

MARIANA
Now I come tot my lord
She that accuses him of fornication
In selfsame manner doth accuse my husband
And charges him my lord with such a time
When Ill depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love

ANGELO
Charges she more than me

MARIANA
Not that I know

DUKE
No you say your husband

MARIANA
Why just my lord and that is Angelo
Who thinks he knows that he neer knew my body
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabels

ANGELO
This is a strange abuseLets see thy face

MARIANA
My husband bids me now I will unmask Unveiling
This is that face thou cruel Angelo
Which once thou sworst was worth the looking on
This is the hand which with a vowd contract
Was fast belockd in thine this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel
And did supply thee at thy gardenhouse
In her imagind person

DUKE
Know you this woman

LUCIO
Carnally she says

DUKE
Sirrah no more

LUCIO
Enough my lord

ANGELO
My lord I must confess I know this woman
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her which was broke off
Partly for that her promisd proportions
Came short of composition but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity since which time of five years
I never spake with her saw her nor heard from her
Upon my faith and honour

MARIANA
Noble prince
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue
I am affiancd this mans wife as strongly
As words could make up vows and my good lord
But Tuesday night last gone in his gardenhouse
He knew me as a wife As this is true
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Or else for ever be confixed here
A marble monument

ANGELO
I did but smile till now
Now good my lord give me the scope of justice
My patience here is touchd I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on Let me have way my lord
To find this practice out

DUKE
Ay with my heart
And punish them to your height of pleasure
Thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman
Compact with her thats gone thinkst thou thy oaths
Though they would swear down each particular saint
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
Thats seald in approbationYou Lord Escalus
Sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse whence tis derivd
There is another friar that set them on
Let him be sent for

PETER
Would lie were here my lord for he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him

DUKE
Go do it instantly

Exit PROVOST

And you my noble and wellwarranted cousin
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth
Do with your injuries as seems you best
In any chastisement I for a while
Will leave you but stir not you till you have well
Determined upon these slanderers

ESCALUS
My lord well do it throughly

Exit DUKE

Signior Lucio did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be
a dishonest person

LUCIO
Cucullus non facit monachum honest in nothing but in his
clothes and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the
duke

ESCALUS
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them
against him we shall find this friar a notable fellow

LUCIO
As any in Vienna on my word

ESCALUS
Call that same Isabel here once again to an Attendant I would
speak with her Pray you my lord give me leave to question you
shall see how Ill handle her

LUCIO
Not better than he by her own report

ESCALUS
Say you

LUCIO
Marry sir I think if you handled her privately she would
sooner confess perchance publicly shell be ashamed

Reenter Officers with ISABELLA

ESCALUS
I will go darkly to work with her

LUCIO
Thats the way for women are light at midnight

ESCALUS
Come on mistress to ISABELLA heres a gentlewoman denies all
that you have said

LUCIO
My lord here comes the rascal I spoke of here with the Provost

Reenter the DUKE in his friars habit and PROVOST

ESCALUS

LUCIO

ESCALUS

DUKE

How Know you where you are

DUKE
Respect to your great place and let the devil
Be sometime honourd for his burning throne
Where is the duke tis he should hear me speak

ESCALUS
The dukes in us and we will hear you speak
Look you speak justly

DUKE
Boldly at least But O poor souls
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox
Good night to your redress Is the duke gone
Then is your cause gone too The dukes unjust
Thus to retort your manifest appeal
And put your trial in the villains mouth
Which here you come to accuse

LUCIO
This is the rascal this is he I spoke of

ESCALUS
Why thou unreverend and unhallowd friar
Ist not enough thou hast subornd these women
To accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear
To call him villain
And then to glance from him to the duke himself
To tax him with injustice Take him hence
To the rack with himWell touze you joint by joint
But we will know his purposeWhat unjust

DUKE
Be not so hot the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own his subject am I not
Nor here provincial My business in this state
Made me a lookeron here in Vienna
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it oerrun the stew laws for all faults
But faults so countenancd that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barbers shop
As much in mock as mark

ESCALUS
Slander to the state Away with him to prison

ANGELO
What can you vouch against him Signior Lucio
Is this the man that you did tell us of

LUCIO
Tis he my lord Come hither goodman baldpate
Do you know me

DUKE
I remember you sir by the sound of your voice I met you at the
prison in the absence of the duke

LUCIO
O did you so And do you remember what you said of the duke

DUKE
Most notedly sir

LUCIO
Do you so sir And was the duke a fleshmonger a fool and a
coward as you then reported him to be

DUKE
You must sir change persons with me ere you make that my
report you indeed spoke so of him and much more much worse

LUCIO
O thou damnable fellow Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy
speeches

DUKE
I protest I love the duke as I love myself

ANGELO
Hark how the villain would gloze now after his treasonable
abuses

ESCALUS
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal Away with him to
prisonWhere is the provostAway with him to prison lay
bolts enough upon him let him speak no moreAway with those
giglots too and with the other confederate companion

The PROVOST lays hands on the DUKE

DUKE
Stay sir stay awhile

ANGELO
What resists heHelp him Lucio

LUCIO
Come sir come sir come sir foh sir Why you baldpated
lying rascal you must be hooded must you Show your knaves
visage with a pox to you show your sheepbiting face and be
hanged an hour Willt not off

Pulls off the Friars hood and discovers the DUKE

DUKE
Thou art the first knave that eer made a duke
First Provost let me bail these gentle three
Sneak not away sirTo Lucio for the friar and you
Must have a word anonLay hold on him

LUCIO
This may prove worse than hanging

DUKE
What you have spoke I pardon sit you downTo ESCALUS
Well borrow place of himTo ANGELO Sir by your leave
Hast thou or word or wit or impudence
That yet can do thee office If thou hast
Rely upon it till my tale be heard
And hold no longer out

ANGELO
O my dread lord
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness
To think I can be undiscernible
When I perceive your grace like power divine
Hath lookd upon my passes Then good Prince
No longer session hold upon my shame
But let my trial be mine own confession
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg

DUKE
Come hither Mariana
Say wast thou eer contracted to this woman

ANGELO
I was my lord

DUKE
Go take her hence and marry her instantly
Do you the office friar which consummate
Return him here againGo with him Provost

Exeunt ANGELO MARIANA PETER and PROVOST

ESCALUS
My lord I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it

DUKE
Come hither Isabel
Your friar is now your prince As I was then
Advertising and holy to your business
Not changing heart with habit I am still
Attorneyd at your service

ISABELLA
O give me pardon
That I your vassal have employd and paind
Your unknown sovereignty

DUKE
You are pardond Isabel
And now dear maid be you as free to us
Your brothers death I know sits at your heart
And you may marvel why I obscurd myself
Labouring to save his life and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost O most kind maid
It was the swift celerity of his death
Which I did think with slower foot came on
That braind my purpose But peace be with him
That life is better life past fearing death
Than that which lives to fear make it your comfort
So happy is your brother

ISABELLA
I do my lord

Reenter ANGELO MARIANA PETER and PROVOST

DUKE
For this newmarried man approaching here
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrongd
Your welldefended honour you must pardon
For Marianas sake but as he adjudgd your brother
Being criminal in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promisebreach
Thereon dependent for your brothers life
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible even from his proper tongue
An Angelo for Claudio death for death
Haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
Like doth quit like and measure still for measure
Then Angelo thy faults thus manifested
Which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoopd to death and with like haste
Away with him

MARIANA
O my most gracious lord
I hope you will not mock me with a husband

DUKE
It is your husband mockd you with a husband
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour
I thought your marriage fit else imputation
For that he knew you might reproach your life
And choke your good to come for his possessions
Although by confiscation they are ours
We do instate and widow you withal
To buy you a better husband

MARIANA
O my dear lord
I crave no other nor no better man

DUKE
Never crave him we are definitive

MARIANA
Gentle my liegeKneeling

DUKE
You do but lose your labour
Away with him to deathTo LUCIO Now sir to you

MARIANA
O my good lordSweet Isabel take my part
Lend me your knees and all my life to come
Ill lend you all my life to do you service

DUKE
Against all sense you do importune her
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact
Her brothers ghost his paved bed would break
And take her hence in horror

MARIANA
Isabel
Sweet Isabel do yet but kneel by me
Hold up your hands say nothingIll speak all
They say best men moulded out of faults
And for the most become much more the better
For being a little bad so may my husband
O Isabel will you not lend a knee

DUKE
He dies for Claudios death

ISABELLA
Kneeling Most bounteous sir
Look if it please you on this man condemnd
As if my brother livd I partly think
A due sincerity governd his deeds
Till he did look on me since it is so
Let him not die My brother had but justice
In that he did the thing for which he died
For Angelo
His act did not oertake his bad intent
And must be buried but as an intent
That perishd by the way Thoughts are no subjects
Intents but merely thoughts

MARIANA
Merely my lord

DUKE
Your suits unprofitable stand up I say
I have bethought me of another fault
Provost how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour

PROVOST
It was commanded so

DUKE
Had you a special warrant for the deed

PROVOST
No my good lord it was by private message

DUKE
For which I do discharge you of your office
Give up your keys

PROVOST
Pardon me noble lord
I thought it was a fault but knew it not
Yet did repent me after more advice
For testimony whereof one in the prison
That should by private order else have died
I have reserved alive

DUKE
Whats he

PROVOST
His name is Barnardine

DUKE
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio
Go fetch him hither let me look upon him

Exit PROVOST

ESCALUS
I am sorry one so learned and so wise
As you Lord Angelo have still appeard
Should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
And lack of temperd judgment afterward

ANGELO
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy
Tis my deserving and I do entreat it

Reenter PROVOST with BARNARDINE CLAUDIO muffled and
JULIET

DUKE
Which is that Barnardine

PROVOST
This my lord

DUKE
There was a friar told me of this man
Sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul
That apprehends no further than this world
And squarst thy life according Thourt condemnd
But for those earthly faults I quit them all
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to comeFriar advise him
I leave him to your handWhat muffled fellows that

PROVOST
This is another prisoner that I savd
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head
As like almost to Claudio as himself

Unmuffles CLAUDIO

DUKE
If he be like your brother to ISABELLA for his sake
Is he pardond and for your lovely sake
Give me your hand and say you will be mine
He is my brother too but fitter time for that
By this Lord Angelo perceives hes safe
Methinks I see a quickning in his eye
Well Angelo your evil quits you well
Look that you love your wife her worth worth yours
I find an apt remission in myself
And yet heres one in place I cannot pardon
You sirrah to Lucio that knew me for a fool a coward
One all of luxury an ass a madman
Wherein have I so deserved of you
That you extol me thus

LUCIO
Faith my lord I spoke it but according to the trick If you
will hang me for
it you may but I had rather it would please you I might be
whipped

DUKE
Whippd first sir and hangd after
Proclaim it Provost round about the city
If any woman wrongd by this lewd fellow
As I have heard him swear himself theres one
Whom he begot with childlet her appear
And he shall marry her the nuptial finishd
Let him be whippd and hangd

LUCIO
I beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore Your
highness said even now I made you a duke good my lord do not
recompense me in making me a cuckold

DUKE
Upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeitsTake him to prison
And see our pleasure herein executed

LUCIO
Marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death whipping and
hanging

DUKE
Slandering a prince deserves it

Exeunt Officers with LUCIO

She Claudio that you wrongd look you restore
Joy to you MarianaLove her Angelo
I have confessd her and I know her virtue
Thanks good friend Escalus for thy much goodness
Theres more behind that is more gratulate
Thanks Provost for thy care and secrecy
We shall employ thee in a worthier place
Forgive him Angelo that brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudios
The offence pardons itselfDear Isabel
I have a motion much imports your good
Whereto if youll a willing ear incline
Whats mine is yours and what is yours is mine
So bring us to our palace where well show
Whats yet behind thats meet you all should know
Exeunt
