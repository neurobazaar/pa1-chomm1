THE WORLD AND THE DOOR


A favourite dodge to get your story read by the public is to assert
that it is true and then add that Truth is stranger than Fiction
I do not know if the yarn I am anxious for you to read is true but
the Spanish purser of the fruit steamer _El Carrero_ swore to me by
the shrine of Santa Guadalupe that he had the facts from the U S
viceconsul at La Paza person who could not possibly have been
cognizant of half of them

As for the adage quoted above I take pleasure in puncturing it by
affirming that I read in a purely fictional story the other day the
line Be it so said the policeman Nothing so strange has yet
cropped out in Truth


When H Ferguson Hedges millionaire promoter investor and
manaboutNewYork turned his thoughts upon matters convivial and
word of it went down the line bouncers took a precautionary turn
at the Indian clubs waiters put ironstone china on his favourite
tables cab drivers crowded close to the curbstone in front of
allnight cafes and careful cashiers in his regular haunts charged
up a few bottles to his account by way of preface and introduction

As a money power a onemillionaire is of small account in a city where
the man who cuts your slice of beef behind the freelunch counter
rides to work in his own automobile But Hedges spent his money as
lavishly loudly and showily as though he were only a clerk
squandering a weeks wages And after all the bartender takes no
interest in your reserve fund He would rather look you up on his
cash register than in Bradstreet

On the evening that the material allegation of facts begins Hedges
was bidding dull care begone in the company of five or six good
fellowsacquaintances and friends who had gathered in his wake

Among them were two younger menRalph Merriam a broker and Wade
his friend

Two deepsea cabmen were chartered At Columbus Circle they hove
to long enough to revile the statue of the great navigator
unpatriotically rebuking him for having voyaged in search of land
instead of liquids Midnight overtook the party marooned in the rear
of a cheap cafe far uptown

Hedges was arrogant overriding and quarrelsome He was burly and
tough irongray but vigorous good for the rest of the night There
was a disputeabout nothing that mattersand the fivefingered words
were passedthe words that represent the glove cast into the lists
Merriam played the role of the verbal Hotspur

Hedges rose quickly seized his chair swung it once and smashed
wildly down at Merriams head Merriam dodged drew a small revolver
and shot Hedges in the chest The leading roysterer stumbled fell in
a wry heap and lay still

Wade a commuter had formed that habit of promptness He juggled
Merriam out a side door walked him to the corner ran him a block and
caught a hansom They rode five minutes and then got out on a dark
corner and dismissed the cab Across the street the lights of a small
saloon betrayed its hectic hospitality

Go in the back room of that saloon said Wade and wait Ill go
find out whats doing and let you know You may take two drinks while
I am goneno more

At ten minutes to one oclock Wade returned Brace up old chap he
said The ambulance got there just as I did The doctor says hes
dead You may have one more drink You let me run this thing for
you Youve got to skip I dont believe a chair is legally a deadly
weapon Youve got to make tracks thats all there is to it

Merriam complained of the cold querulously and asked for another
drink Did you notice what big veins he had on the back of his
hands he said I never could standI never could

Take one more said Wade and then come on Ill see you through

Wade kept his promise so well that at eleven oclock the next morning
Merriam with a new suit case full of new clothes and hairbrushes
stepped quietly on board a little 500ton fruit steamer at an East
River pier The vessel had brought the seasons first cargo of limes
from Port Limon and was homeward bound Merriam had his bank balance
of 2800 in his pocket in large bills and brief instructions to pile
up as much water as he could between himself and New York There was
no time for anything more

From Port Limon Merriam worked down the coast by schooner and sloop to
Colon thence across the isthmus to Panama where he caught a tramp
bound for Callao and such intermediate ports as might tempt the
discursive skipper from his course

It was at La Paz that Merriam decided to landLa Paz the Beautiful
a little harbourless town smothered in a living green ribbon that
banded the foot of a cloudpiercing mountain Here the little
steamer stopped to tread water while the captains dory took him
ashore that he might feel the pulse of the cocoanut market Merriam
went too with his suit case and remained

Kalb the viceconsul a GraecoArmenian citizen of the United States
born in HessenDarmstadt and educated in Cincinnati ward primaries
considered all Americans his brothers and bankers He attached
himself to Merriams elbow introduced him to every one in La Paz who
wore shoes borrowed ten dollars and went back to his hammock

There was a little wooden hotel in the edge of a banana grove facing
the sea that catered to the tastes of the few foreigners that had
dropped out of the world into the _triste_ Peruvian town At Kalbs
introductory Shake hands with  he had obediently exchanged
manual salutations with a German doctor one French and two Italian
merchants and three or four Americans who were spoken of as gold men
rubber men mahogany menanything but men of living tissue

After dinner Merriam sat in a corner of the broad front _galeria_ with
Bibb a Vermonter interested in hydraulic mining and smoked and drank
Scotch smoke The moonlit sea spreading infinitely before him
seemed to separate him beyond all apprehension from his old life The
horrid tragedy in which he had played such a disastrous part now
began for the first time since he stole on board the fruiter a
wretched fugitive to lose its sharper outlines Distance lent
assuagement to his view Bibb had opened the floodgates of a stream
of longdammed discourse overjoyed to have captured an audience that
had not suffered under a hundred repetitions of his views and
theories

One year more said Bibb and Ill go back to Gods country Oh I
know its pretty here and you get _dolce far niente_ handed to you in
chunks but this country wasnt made for a white man to live in
Youve got to have to plug through snow now and then and see a game
of baseball and wear a stiff collar and have a policeman cuss you
Still La Paz is a good sort of a pipedreamy old hole And Mrs
Conant is here When any of us feels particularly like jumping into
the sea we rush around to her house and propose Its nicer to be
rejected by Mrs Conant than it is to be drowned And they say
drowning is a delightful sensation

Many like her here asked Merriam

Not anywhere said Bibb with a comfortable sigh Shes the only
white woman in La Paz The rest range from a dappled dun to the
colour of a bflat piano key Shes been here a year Comes
fromwell you know how a woman can talkask em to say string
and theyll say crows foot or cats cradle Sometimes youd think
she was from Oshkosh and again from Jacksonville Florida and the
next day from Cape Cod

Mystery ventured Merriam

Mwell she looks it but her talks translucent enough But
thats a woman I suppose if the Sphinx were to begin talking shed
merely say Goodness me more visitors coming for dinner and nothing
to eat but the sand which is here But you wont think about that
when you meet her Merriam Youll propose to her too

To make a hard story soft Merriam did meet her and propose to her
He found her to be a woman in black with hair the colour of a bronze
turkeys wings and mysterious _remembering_ eyes thatwell that
looked as if she might have been a trained nurse looking on when Eve
was created Her words and manner though were translucent as Bibb
had said She spoke vaguely of friends in California and some of
the lower parishes in Louisiana The tropical climate and indolent
life suited her she had thought of buying an orange grove later on
La Paz all in all charmed her

Merriams courtship of the Sphinx lasted three months although be did
not know that he was courting her He was using her as an antidote
for remorse until he found too late that he had acquired the habit
During that time he had received no news from home Wade did not know
where he was and he was not sure of Wades exact address and was
afraid to write He thought he had better let matters rest as they
were for a while

One afternoon he and Mrs Conant hired two ponies and rode out along
the mountain trail as far as the little cold river that came tumbling
down the foothills There they stopped for a drink and Merriam spoke
his piecehe proposed as Bibb had prophesied

Mrs Conant gave him one glance of brilliant tenderness and then her
face took on such a strange haggard look that Merriam was shaken out
of his intoxication and back to his senses

I beg your pardon Florence he said releasing her hand but Ill
have to hedge on part of what I said I cant ask you to marry me of
course I killed a man in New Yorka man who was my friendshot
him downin quite a cowardly manner I understand Of course the
drinking didnt excuse it Well I couldnt resist having my say and
Ill always mean it Im here as a fugitive from justice andI
suppose that ends our acquaintance

Mrs Conant plucked little leaves assiduously from the lowhanging
branch of a lime tree

I suppose so she said in low and oddly uneven tones but that
depends upon you Ill be as honest as you were I poisoned my
husband I am a selfmade widow A man cannot love a murderess So
I suppose that ends our acquaintance

She looked up at him slowly His face turned a little pale and he
stared at her blankly like a deafanddumb man who was wondering what
it was all about

She took a swift step toward him with stiffened arms and eyes
blazing

Dont look at me like that she cried as though she were in acute
pain Curse me or turn your back on me but dont look that way
Am I a woman to be beaten If I could show youhere on my arms
and on my back are scarsand it has been more than a yearscars
that he made in his brutal rages A holy nun would have risen and
struck the fiend down Yes I killed him The foul and horrible
words that he hurled at me that last day are repeated in my ears every
night when I sleep And then came his blows and the end of my
endurance I got the poison that afternoon It was his custom to
drink every night in the library before going to bed a hot punch made
of rum and wine Only from my fair hands would he receive it
because he knew the fumes of spirits always sickened me That night
when the maid brought it to me I sent her downstairs on an errand
Before taking him his drink I went to my little private cabinet and
poured into it more than a teaspoonful of tincture of aconite
enough to kill three men so I had learned I had drawn 6000 that I
had in bank and with that and a few things in a satchel I left the
house without any one seeing me As I passed the library I heard him
stagger up and fall heavily on a couch I took a night train for New
Orleans and from there I sailed to the Bermudas I finally cast
anchor in La Paz And now what have you to say Can you open your
mouth

Merriam came back to life

Florence he said earnestly I want you I dont care what youve
done If the world

Ralph she interrupted almost with a scream be my world

Her eyes melted she relaxed magnificently and swayed toward Merriam
so suddenly that he had to jump to catch her

Dear me in such scenes how the talk runs into artificial prose But
it cant be helped Its the subconscious smell of the footlights
smoke thats in all of us Stir the depths of your cooks soul
sufficiently and she will discourse in BulwerLyttonese

Merriam and Mrs Conant were very happy He announced their
engagement at the Hotel Orilla del Mar Eight foreigners and four
native Astors pounded his back and shouted insincere congratulations
at him Pedrito the Castilianmannered barkeep was goaded to extra
duty until his agility would have turned a Boston cherryphosphate
clerk a pale lilac with envy

They were both very happy According to the strange mathematics of
the god of mutual affinity the shadows that clouded their pasts when
united became only half as dense instead of darker They shut the
world out and bolted the doors Each was the others world Mrs
Conant lived again The remembering look left her eyes Merriam was
with her every moment that was possible On a little plateau under a
grove of palms and calabash trees they were going to build a fairy
bungalow They were to be married in two months Many hours of the
day they had their heads together over the house plans Their joint
capital would set up a business in fruit or woods that would yield a
comfortable support Good night my world would say Mrs Conant
every evening when Merriam left her for his hotel They were very
happy Their love had circumstantially that element of melancholy
in it that it seems to require to attain its supremest elevation And
it seemed that their mutual great misfortune or sin was a bond that
nothing could sever

One day a steamer hove in the offing Barelegged and bareshouldered
La Paz scampered down to the beach for the arrival of a steamer was
their looptheloop circus Emancipation Day and fouroclock tea

When the steamer was near enough wise ones proclaimed that she was
the _Pajaro_ bound upcoast from Callao to Panama

The _Pajaro_ put on brakes a mile off shore Soon a boat came bobbing
shoreward Merriam strolled down on the beach to look on In the
shallow water the Carib sailors sprang out and dragged the boat with a
mighty rush to the firm shingle Out climbed the purser the captain
and two passengers ploughing their way through the deep sand toward
the hotel Merriam glanced toward them with the mild interest due to
strangers There was something familiar to him in the walk of one of
the passengers He looked again and his blood seemed to turn to
strawberry ice cream in his veins Burly arrogant debonair as ever
H Ferguson Hedges the man he had killed was coming toward him ten
feet away

When Hedges saw Merriam his face flushed a dark red Then he shouted
in his old bluff way Hello Merriam Glad to see you Didnt
expect to find you out here Quinby this is my old friend Merriam
of New YorkMerriam Mr Quinby

Merriam gave Hedges and then Quinby an icecold hand Brrrr said
Hedges But youve got a frapped flipper Man youre not well
Youre as yellow as a Chinaman Malarial here Steer us to a bar if
there is such a thing and lets take a prophylactic

Merriam still half comatose led them toward the Hotel Orilla del
Mar

Quinby and I explained Hedges puffing through the slippery sand
are looking out along the coast for some investments Weve just
come up from Concepcion and Valparaiso and Lima The captain of this
subsidized ferry boat told us there was some good picking around
here in silver mines So we got off Now where is that cafe
Merriam Oh in this portable soda water pavilion

Leaving Quinby at the bar Hedges drew Merriam aside

Now what does this mean he said with gruff kindness Are you
sulking about that fool row we had

I thought stammered MerriamI heardthey told me you were
that I had

Well you didnt and Im not said Hedges That fool young
ambulance surgeon told Wade I was a candidate for a coffin just
because Id got tired and quit breathing I laid up in a private
hospital for a month but here I am kicking as hard as ever Wade
and I tried to find you but couldnt Now Merriam shake hands and
forget it all I was as much to blame as you were and the shot
really did me goodI came out of the hospital as healthy and fit as
a cab horse Come on that drinks waiting

Old man said Merriam brokenly I dont know how to thank youI
well you know

Oh forget it boomed Hedges Quinbyll die of thirst if we dont
join him

Bibb was sitting on the shady side of the gallery waiting for the
elevenoclock breakfast Presently Merriam came out and joined him
His eye was strangely bright

Bibb my boy said he slowly waving his hand do you see those
mountains and that sea and sky and sunshinetheyre mine Bibbsy
all mine

You go in said Bibb and take eight grains of quinine right away
It wont do in this climate for a man to get to thinking hes
Rockefeller or James ONeill either

Inside the purser was untying a great roll of newspapers many of
them weeks old gathered in the lower ports by the _Pajaro_ to be
distributed at casual stoppingplaces Thus do the beneficent voyagers
scatter news and entertainment among the prisoners of sea and
mountains

Tio Pancho the hotel proprietor set his great silverrimmed _anteojos_
upon his nose and divided the papers into a number of smaller rolls
A barefooted _muchacho_ dashed in desiring the post of messenger

_Bien venido_ said Tio Pancho This to Senora Conant that to el
Doctor SSSchlegel_Dios_ what a name to saythat to Senor Davis
one for Don Alberto These two for the _Casa de Huespedes Numero
6 en la calle de las Buenas Gracias_ And say to them all _muchacho_
that the _Pajaro_ sails for Panama at three this afternoon If any have
letters to send by the post let them come quickly that they may
first pass through the _correo_

Mrs Conant received her roll of newspapers at four oclock The boy
was late in delivering them because he had been deflected from his
duty by an iguana that crossed his path and to which he immediately
gave chase But it made no hardship for she had no letters to send

She was idling in a hammock in the patio of the house that she
occupied half awake half happily dreaming of the paradise that she
and Merriam had created out of the wrecks of their pasts She was
content now for the horizon of that shimmering sea to be the horizon
of her life They had shut out the world and closed the door

Merriam was coming to her house at seven after his dinner at the
hotel She would put on a white dress and an apricotcoloured lace
mantilla and they would walk an hour under the cocoanut palms by the
lagoon She smiled contentedly and chose a paper at random from the
roll the boy had brought

At first the words of a certain headline of a Sunday newspaper meant
nothing to her they conveyed only a visualized sense of familiarity
The largest type ran thus Lloyd B Conant secures divorce And then
the subheadings Wellknown Saint Louis paint manufacturer wins
suit pleading one years absence of wife Her mysterious
disappearance recalled Nothing has been heard of her since

Twisting herself quickly out of the hammock Mrs Conants eye soon
traversed the halfcolumn of the Recall It ended thus It will be
remembered that Mrs Conant disappeared one evening in March of last
year It was freely rumoured that her marriage with Lloyd B Conant
resulted in much unhappiness Stories were not wanting to the effect
that his cruelty toward his wife had more than once taken the form of
physical abuse After her departure a full bottle of tincture of
aconite a deadly poison was found in a small medicine cabinet in her
bedroom This might have been an indication that she meditated
suicide It is supposed that she abandoned such an intention if she
possessed it and left her home instead

Mrs Conant slowly dropped the paper and sat on a chair clasping her
hands tightly

Let me thinkO Godlet me think she whispered I took
the bottle with me    I threw it out of the window of the train
   I    there was another bottle in the cabinet   
there were two side by sidethe aconiteand the valerian that I
took when I could not sleep    If they found the aconite bottle
full whybut he is alive of courseI gave him only a
harmless dose of valerian    I am not a murderess in fact   
Ralph IO God dont let this be a dream

She went into the part of the house that she rented from the old
Peruvian man and his wife shut the door and walked up and down her
room swiftly and feverishly for half an hour Merriams photograph
stood in a frame on a table She picked it up looked at it with a
smile of exquisite tenderness anddropped four tears on it And
Merriam only twenty rods away Then she stood still for ten minutes
looking into space She looked into space through a slowly opening
door On her side of the door was the building material for a castle
of Romancelove an Arcady of waving palms a lullaby of waves on
the shore of a haven of rest respite peace a lotus land of dreamy
ease and securitya life of poetry and hearts ease and refuge
Romanticist will you tell me what Mrs Conant saw on the other side
of the door You cannotthat is you will not Very well then
listen

_She saw herself go into a department store and buy five spools of
silk thread and three yards of gingham to make an apron for the cook
Shall I charge it maam asked the clerk As she walked out a
lady whom she met greeted her cordially Oh where did you get the
pattern for those sleeves dear Mrs Conant she said At the corner
a policeman helped her across the street and touched his helmet Any
callers she asked the maid when she reached home Mrs Waldron
answered the maid and the two Misses Jenkinson Very well she
said You may bring me a cup of tea Maggie_

Mrs Conant went to the door and called Angela the old Peruvian
woman If Mateo is there send him to me Mateo a halfbreed
shuffling and old but efficient came

Is there a steamer or a vessel of any kind leaving this coast
tonight or tomorrow that I can get passage on she asked

Mateo considered

At Punta Reina thirty miles down the coast senora he answered
there is a small steamer loading with cinchona and dyewoods She
sails for San Francisco tomorrow at sunrise So says my brother who
arrived in his sloop today passing by Punta Reina

You must take me in that sloop to that steamer tonight Will you do
that

Perhaps Mateo shrugged a suggestive shoulder Mrs Conant
took a handful of money from a drawer and gave it to him

Get the sloop ready behind the little point of land below the town
she ordered Get sailors and be ready to sail at six oclock In
half an hour bring a cart partly filled with straw into the patio
here and take my trunk to the sloop There is more money yet Now
hurry

For one time Mateo walked away without shuffling his feet

Angela cried Mrs Conant almost fiercely come and help me pack
I am going away Out with this trunk My clothes first Stir
yourself Those dark dresses first Hurry

From the first she did not waver from her decision Her view was clear
and final Her door had opened and let the world in Her love for
Merriam was not lessened but it now appeared a hopeless and
unrealizable thing The visions of their future that had seemed so
blissful and complete had vanished She tried to assure herself that
her renunciation was rather for his sake than for her own Now that
she was cleared of her burdenat least technicallywould not
his own weigh too heavily upon him If she should cling to him would
not the difference forever silently mar and corrode their happiness
Thus she reasoned but there were a thousand little voices calling to
her that she could feel rather than hear like the hum of distant
powerful machinerythe little voices of the world that when
raised in unison can send their insistent call through the thickest
door

Once while packing a brief shadow of the lotus dream came back to
her She held Merriams picture to her heart with one hand while she
threw a pair of shoes into the trunk with her other

At six oclock Mateo returned and reported the sloop ready He and
his brother lifted the trunk into the cart covered it with straw and
conveyed it to the point of embarkation From there they transferred
it on board in the sloops dory Then Mateo returned for additional
orders

Mrs Conant was ready She had settled all business matters with
Angela and was impatiently waiting She wore a long loose blacksilk
duster that she often walked about in when the evenings were chilly
On her head was a small round hat and over it the apricotcoloured
lace mantilla

Dusk had quickly followed the short twilight Mateo led her by dark
and grassgrown streets toward the point behind which the sloop was
anchored On turning a corner they beheld the Hotel Orilla del Mar
three streets away nebulously aglow with its array of kerosene lamps

Mrs Conant paused with streaming eyes I must I _must_ see him
once before I go she murmured in anguish But even then she did not
falter in her decision Quickly she invented a plan by which she might
speak to him and yet make her departure without his knowing She
would walk past the hotel ask some one to call him out and talk a few
moments on some trivial excuse leaving him expecting to see her at
her home at seven

She unpinned her hat and gave it to Mateo Keep this and wait here
till I come she ordered Then she draped the mantilla over her head
as she usually did when walking after sunset and went straight to the
Orilla del Mar

She was glad to see the bulky whiteclad figure of Tio Pancho
standing alone on the gallery

Tio Pancho she said with a charming smile may I trouble you to
ask Mr Merriam to come out for just a few moments that I may speak
with him

Tio Pancho bowed as an elephant bows

Buenas tardes Senora Conant he said as a cavalier talks And
then he went on less at his ease

But does not the senora know that Senor Merriam sailed on the _Pajaro_
for Panama at three oclock of this afternoon




II

THE THEORY AND THE HOUND


Not many days ago my old friend from the tropics J P Bridger
United States consul on the island of Ratona was in the city We
had wassail and jubilee and saw the Flatiron building and missed
seeing the Bronxless menagerie by about a couple of nights And
then at the ebb tide we were walking up a street that parallels and
parodies Broadway

A woman with a comely and mundane countenance passed us holding in
leash a wheezing vicious waddling brute of a yellow pug The dog
entangled himself with Bridgers legs and mumbled his ankles in a
snarling peevish sulky bite Bridger with a happy smile kicked
the breath out of the brute the woman showered us with a quick rain
of wellconceived adjectives that left us in no doubt as to our place
in her opinion and we passed on Ten yards farther an old woman
with disordered white hair and her bankbook tucked well hidden
beneath her tattered shawl begged Bridger stopped and disinterred
for her a quarter from his holiday waistcoat

On the next corner a quarter of a ton of wellclothed man with a
ricepowdered fat white jowl stood holding the chain of a
devilborn bulldog whose forelegs were strangers by the length of a
dachshund A little woman in a lastseasons hat confronted him and
wept which was plainly all she could do while he cursed her in low
sweet practised tones

Bridger smiled againstrictly to himselfand this time he took out
a little memorandum book and made a note of it This he had no right
to do without due explanation and I said so

Its a new theory said Bridger that I picked up down in Ratona
Ive been gathering support for it as I knock about The world isnt
ripe for it yet butwell Ill tell you and then you run your
mind back along the people youve known and see what you make of it

And so I cornered Bridger in a place where they have artificial palms
and wine and he told me the story which is here in my words and on
his responsibility

One afternoon at three oclock on the island of Ratona a boy raced
along the beach screaming _Pajaro_ ahoy

Thus he made known the keenness of his hearing and the justice of his
discrimination in pitch

He who first heard and made oral proclamation concerning the toot
of an approaching steamers whistle and correctly named the steamer
was a small hero in Ratonauntil the next steamer came Wherefore
there was rivalry among the barefoot youth of Ratona and many fell
victims to the softly blown conch shells of sloops which as they
enter harbour sound surprisingly like a distant steamers signal
And some could name you the vessel when its call in your duller
ears sounded no louder than the sigh of the wind through the
branches of the cocoanut palms

But today he who proclaimed the _Pajaro_ gained his honours Ratona
bent its ear to listen and soon the deeptongued blast grew louder
and nearer and at length Ratona saw above the line of palms on the
low point the two black funnels of the fruiter slowly creeping
toward the mouth of the harbour

You must know that Ratona is an island twenty miles off the south of
a South American republic It is a port of that republic and it
sleeps sweetly in a smiling sea toiling not nor spinning fed by the
abundant tropics where all things ripen cease and fall toward the
grave

Eight hundred people dream life away in a greenembowered village
that follows the horseshoe curve of its bijou harbour They are
mostly Spanish and Indian _mestizos_ with a shading of San Domingo
Negroes a lightening of pureblood Spanish officials and a slight
leavening of the froth of three or four pioneering white races No
steamers touch at Ratona save the fruit steamers which take on their
banana inspectors there on their way to the coast They leave Sunday
newspapers ice quinine bacon watermelons and vaccine matter at
the island and that is about all the touch Ratona gets with the
world

The _Pajaro_ paused at the mouth of the harbour rolling heavily in
the swell that sent the whitecaps racing beyond the smooth water
inside Already two dories from the villageone conveying fruit
inspectors the other going for what it could getwere halfway out
to the steamer

The inspectors dory was taken on board with them and the _Pajaro_
steamed away for the mainland for its load of fruit

The other boat returned to Ratona bearing a contribution from the
_Pajaros_ store of ice the usual roll of newspapers and one
passengerTaylor Plunkett sheriff of Chatham County Kentucky

Bridger the United States consul at Ratona was cleaning his rifle
in the official shanty under a breadfruit tree twenty yards from the
water of the harbour The consul occupied a place somewhat near the
tail of his political partys procession The music of the band
wagon sounded very faintly to him in the distance The plums of
office went to others Bridgers share of the spoilsthe
consulship at Ratonawas little more than a prunea dried prune
from the boardinghouse department of the public crib But 900
yearly was opulence in Ratona Besides Bridger had contracted a
passion for shooting alligators in the lagoons near his consulate
and was not unhappy

He looked up from a careful inspection of his rifle lock and saw a
broad man filling his doorway A broad noiseless slowmoving man
sunburned almost to the brown of Vandyke A man of fortyfive
neatly clothed in homespun with scanty light hair a closeclipped
brownandgray beard and paleblue eyes expressing mildness and
simplicity

You are Mr Bridger the consul said the broad man They
directed me here Can you tell me what those big bunches of things
like gourds are in those trees that look like feather dusters along
the edge of the water

Take that chair said the consul reoiling his cleaning rag
No the other onethat bamboo thing wont hold you Why theyre
cocoanutsgreen cocoanuts The shell of em is always a light
green before theyre ripe

Much obliged said the other man sitting down carefully I
didnt quite like to tell the folks at home they were olives unless I
was sure about it My name is Plunkett Im sheriff of Chatham
County Kentucky Ive got extradition papers in my pocket
authorizing the arrest of a man on this island Theyve been signed
by the President of this country and theyre in correct shape The
mans name is Wade Williams Hes in the cocoanut raising
business What hes wanted for is the murder of his wife two years
ago Where can I find him

The consul squinted an eye and looked through his rifle barrel

Theres nobody on the island who calls himself Williams he
remarked

Didnt suppose there was said Plunkett mildly Hell do by any
other name

Besides myself said Bridger there are only two Americans on
RatonaBob Reeves and Henry Morgan

The man I want sells cocoanuts suggested Plunkett

You see that cocoanut walk extending up to the point said the
consul waving his hand toward the open door That belongs to Bob
Reeves Henry Morgan owns half the trees to looard on the island

One month ago said the sheriff Wade Williams wrote a
confidential letter to a man in Chatham county telling him where he
was and how he was getting along The letter was lost and the person
that found it gave it away They sent me after him and Ive got the
papers I reckon hes one of your cocoanut men for certain

Youve got his picture of course said Bridger It might be
Reeves or Morgan but Id hate to think it Theyre both as fine
fellows as youd meet in an allday auto ride

No doubtfully answered Plunkett there wasnt any picture of
Williams to be had And I never saw him myself Ive been sheriff
only a year But Ive got a pretty accurate description of him About
5 feet 11 darkhair and eyes nose inclined to be Roman heavy about
the shoulders strong white teeth with none missing laughs a good
deal talkative drinks considerably but never to intoxication looks
you square in the eye when talking age thirtyfive Which one of
your men does that description fit

The consul grinned broadly

Ill tell you what you do he said laying down his rifle and
slipping on his dingy black alpaca coat You come along Mr
Plunkett and Ill take you up to see the boys If you can tell
which one of em your description fits better than it does the
other you have the advantage of me

Bridger conducted the sheriff out and along the hard beach close to
which the tiny houses of the village were distributed Immediately
back of the town rose sudden small thickly wooded hills Up one of
these by means of steps cut in the hard clay the consul led
Plunkett On the very verge of an eminence was perched a tworoom
wooden cottage with a thatched roof A Carib woman was washing
clothes outside The consul ushered the sheriff to the door of the
room that overlooked the harbour

Two men were in the room about to sit down in their shirt sleeves
to a table spread for dinner They bore little resemblance one to
the other in detail but the general description given by Plunkett
could have been justly applied to either In height colour of hair
shape of nose build and manners each of them tallied with it They
were fair types of jovial readywitted broadgauged Americans who
had gravitated together for companionship in an alien land

Hello Bridger they called in unison at sight Of the consul Come
and have dinner with us And then they noticed Plunkett at his
heels and came forward with hospitable curiosity

Gentlemen said the consul his voice taking on unaccustomed
formality this is Mr Plunkett Mr PlunkettMr Reeves and Mr
Morgan

The cocoanut barons greeted the newcomer joyously Reeves seemed
about an inch taller than Morgan but his laugh was not quite as
loud Morgans eyes were deep brown Reevess were black Reeves
was the host and busied himself with fetching other chairs and
calling to the Carib woman for supplemental table ware It was
explained that Morgan lived in a bamboo shack to looard but that
every day the two friends dined together Plunkett stood still
during the preparations looking about mildly with his paleblue
eyes Bridger looked apologetic and uneasy

At length two other covers were laid and the company was assigned to
places Reeves and Morgan stood side by side across the table from
the visitors Reeves nodded genially as a signal for all to seat
themselves And then suddenly Plunkett raised his hand with a
gesture of authority He was looking straight between Reeves and
Morgan

Wade Williams he said quietly you are under arrest for murder

Reeves and Morgan instantly exchanged a quick bright glance the
quality of which was interrogation with a seasoning of surprise
Then simultaneously they turned to the speaker with a puzzled and
frank deprecation in their gaze

Cant say that we understand you Mr Plunkett said Morgan
cheerfully Did you say Williams

Whats the joke Bridgy asked Reeves turning to the consul with
a smile

Before Bridger could answer Plunkett spoke again

Ill explain he said quietly One of you dont need any
explanation but this is for the other one One of you is Wade
Williams of Chatham County Kentucky You murdered your wife on May
5 two years ago after illtreating and abusing her continually for
five years I have the proper papers in my pocket for taking you
back with me and you are going We will return on the fruit steamer
that comes back by this island tomorrow to leave its inspectors I
acknowledge gentlemen that Im not quite sure which one of you is
Williams But Wade Williams goes back to Chatham County tomorrow I
want you to understand that

A great sound of merry laughter from Morgan and Reeves went out over
the still harbour Two or three fishermen in the fleet of sloops
anchored there looked up at the house of the diablos Americanos on
the hill and wondered

My dear Mr Plunkett cried Morgan conquering his mirth the
dinner is getting cold Let us sit down and eat I am anxious to
get my spoon into that sharkfin soup Business afterward

Sit down gentlemen if you please added Reeves pleasantly I
am sure Mr Plunkett will not object Perhaps a little time may be of
advantage to him in identifyingthe gentleman he wishes to
arrest

No objections Im sure said Plunkett dropping into his chair
heavily Im hungry myself I didnt want to accept the
hospitality of you folks without giving you notice thats all

Reeves set bottles and glasses on the table

Theres cognac he said and anisada and Scotch smoke and rye
Take your choice

Bridger chose rye Reeves poured three fingers of Scotch for himself
Morgan took the same The sheriff against much protestation filled
his glass from the water bottle

Heres to the appetite said Reeves raising his glass of Mr
Williams Morgans laugh and his drink encountering sent him into a
choking splutter All began to pay attention to the dinner which
was well cooked and palatable

Williams called Plunkett suddenly and sharply

All looked up wonderingly Reeves found the sheriffs mild eye
resting upon him He flushed a little

See here he said with some asperity my names Reeves and I
dont want you to But the comedy of the thing came to his rescue
and he ended with a laugh

I suppose Mr Plunkett said Morgan carefully seasoning an
alligator pear that you are aware of the fact that you will import
a good deal of trouble for yourself into Kentucky if you take back
the wrong manthat is of course if you take anybody back

Thank you for the salt said the sheriff Oh Ill take somebody
back Itll be one of you two gentlemen Yes I know Id get stuck
for damages if I make a mistake But Im going to try to get the
right man

Ill tell you what you do said Morgan leaning forward with a
jolly twinkle in his eyes You take me Ill go without any
trouble The cocoanut business hasnt panned out well this year and
Id like to make some extra money out of your bondsmen

Thats not fair chimed in Reeves I got only 16 a thousand for
my last shipment Take me Mr Plunkett

Ill take Wade Williams said the sheriff patiently or Ill come
pretty close to it

Its like dining with a ghost remarked Morgan with a pretended
shiver The ghost of a murderer too Will somebody pass the
toothpicks to the shade of the naughty Mr Williams

Plunkett seemed as unconcerned as if he were dining at his own table
in Chatham County He was a gallant trencherman and the strange
tropic viands tickled his palate Heavy commonplace almost
slothful in his movements he appeared to be devoid of all the
cunning and watchfulness of the sleuth He even ceased to observe
with any sharpness or attempted discrimination the two men one of
whom he had undertaken with surprising selfconfidence to drag
away upon the serious charge of wifemurder Here indeed was a
problem set before him that if wrongly solved would have amounted to
his serious discomfiture yet there he sat puzzling his soul to all
appearances over the novel flavour of a broiled iguana cutlet

The consul felt a decided discomfort Reeves and Morgan were his
friends and pals yet the sheriff from Kentucky had a certain right
to his official aid and moral support So Bridger sat the silentest
around the board and tried to estimate the peculiar situation His
conclusion was that both Reeves and Morgan quickwitted as he knew
them to be had conceived at the moment of Plunketts disclosure of
his missionand in the brief space of a lightning flashthe
idea that the other might be the guilty Williams and that each of
them had decided in that moment loyally to protect his comrade
against the doom that threatened him This was the consuls theory
and if he had been a bookmaker at a race of wits for life and liberty
he would have offered heavy odds against the plodding sheriff from
Chatham County Kentucky

When the meal was concluded the Carib woman came and removed the
dishes and cloth Reeves strewed the table with excellent cigars
and Plunkett with the others lighted one of these with evident
gratification

I may be dull said Morgan with a grin and a wink at Bridger but
I want to know if I am Now I say this is all a joke of Mr
Plunketts concocted to frighten two babesinthewoods Is this
Williamson to be taken seriously or not

Williams corrected Plunkett gravely I never got off any jokes
in my life I know I wouldnt travel 2000 miles to get off a poor
one as this would be if I didnt take Wade Williams back with me
Gentlemen continued the sheriff now letting his mild eyes travel
impartially from one of the company to another see if you can find
any joke in this case Wade Williams is listening to the words I
utter now but out of politeness I will speak of him as a third
person For five years he made his wife lead the life of a dogNo
Ill take that back No dog in Kentucky was ever treated as she
was He spent the money that she brought himspent it at races at
the card table and on horses and hunting He was a good fellow to
his friends but a cold sullen demon at home He wound up the five
years of neglect by striking her with his closed handa hand as
hard as a stonewhen she was ill and weak from suffering She
died the next day and he skipped Thats all there is to it Its
enough I never saw Williams but I knew his wife Im not a man to
tell half She and I were keeping company when she met him She
went to Louisville on a visit and saw him there Ill admit that he
spoilt my chances in no time I lived then on the edge of the
Cumberland mountains I was elected sheriff of Chatham County a year
after Wade Williams killed his wife My official duty sends me out
here after him but Ill admit that theres personal feeling too
And hes going back with me MrerReeves will you pass me a
match

Awfully imprudent of Williams said Morgan putting his feet up
against the wall to strike a Kentucky lady Seems to me Ive heard
they were scrappers

Bad bad Williams said Reeves pouring out more Scotch

The two men spoke lightly but the consul saw and felt the tension
and the carefulness in their actions and words Good old fellows
he said to himself theyre both all right Each of em is standing
by the other like a little brick church

And then a dog walked into the room where they sata blackandtan
hound longeared lazy confident of welcome

Plunkett turned his head and looked at the animal which halted
confidently within a few feet of his chair

Suddenly the sheriff with a deepmouthed oath left his seat and
bestowed upon the dog a vicious and heavy kick with his ponderous
shoe

The hound heartbroken astonished with flapping ears and incurved
tail uttered a piercing yelp of pain and surprise

Reeves and the consul remained in their chairs saying nothing but
astonished at the unexpected show of intolerance from the easygoing
man from Chatham county

But Morgan with a suddenly purpling face leaped to his feet and
raised a threatening arm above the guest

Youbrute he shouted passionately why did you do that

Quickly the amenities returned Plunkett muttered some indistinct
apology and regained his seat Morgan with a decided effort
controlled his indignation and also returned to his chair

And then Plunkett with the spring of a tiger leaped around the
corner of the table and snapped handcuffs on the paralyzed Morgans
wrists

Houndlover and womankiller he cried get ready to meet your
God

When Bridger had finished I asked him

Did he get the right man

He did said the Consul

And how did he know I inquired being in a kind of bewilderment

When he put Morgan in the dory answered Bridger the next day to
take him aboard the _Pajaro_ this man Plunkett stopped to shake hands
with me and I asked him the same question

Mr Bridger said he Im a Kentuckian and Ive seen a great
deal of both men and animals And I never yet saw a man that was
overfond of horses and dogs but what was cruel to women




III

THE HYPOTHESES OF FAILURE


Lawyer Gooch bestowed his undivided attention upon the engrossing arts
of his profession But one flight of fancy did he allow his mind to
entertain He was fond of likening his suite of office rooms to the
bottom of a ship The rooms were three in number with a door
opening from one to another These doors could also be closed

Ships Lawyer Gooch would say are constructed for safety with
separate watertight compartments in their bottoms If one
compartment springs a leak it fills with water but the good ship goes
on unhurt Were it not for the separating bulkheads one leak would
sink the vessel Now it often happens that while I am occupied with
clients other clients with conflicting interests call With the
assistance of Archibaldan office boy with a futureI cause the
dangerous influx to be diverted into separate compartments while I
sound with my legal plummet the depth of each If necessary they
may be baled into the hallway and permitted to escape by way of the
stairs which we may term the lee scuppers Thus the good ship of
business is kept afloat whereas if the element that supports her were
allowed to mingle freely in her hold we might be swampedha ha ha

The law is dry Good jokes are few Surely it might be permitted
Lawyer Gooch to mitigate the bore of briefs the tedium of torts and
the prosiness of processes with even so light a levy upon the good
property of humour

Lawyer Goochs practice leaned largely to the settlement of marital
infelicities Did matrimony languish through complications he
mediated soothed and arbitrated Did it suffer from implications
he readjusted defended and championed Did it arrive at the
extremity of duplications he always got light sentences for his
clients

But not always was Lawyer Gooch the keen armed wily belligerent
ready with his twoedged sword to lop off the shackles of Hymen He
had been known to build up instead of demolishing to reunite instead
of severing to lead erring and foolish ones back into the fold
instead of scattering the flock Often had he by his eloquent and
moving appeals sent husband and wife weeping back into each others
arms Frequently he had coached childhood so successfully that at
the psychological moment and at a given signal the plaintive pipe of
Papa wont you tum home adain to me and muvver had won the day
and upheld the pillars of a tottering home

Unprejudiced persons admitted that Lawyer Gooch received as big fees
from these reyoked clients as would have been paid him had the cases
been contested in court Prejudiced ones intimated that his fees were
doubled because the penitent couples always came back later for the
divorce anyhow

There came a season in June when the legal ship of Lawyer Gooch to
borrow his own figure was nearly becalmed The divorce mill grinds
slowly in June It is the month of Cupid and Hymen

Lawyer Gooch then sat idle in the middle room of his clientless
suite A small anteroom connectedor rather separatedthis
apartment from the hallway Here was stationed Archibald who wrested
from visitors their cards or oral nomenclature which he bore to his
master while they waited

Suddenly on this day there came a great knocking at the outermost
door

Archibald opening it was thrust aside as superfluous by the visitor
who without due reverence at once penetrated to the office of Lawyer
Gooch and threw himself with goodnatured insolence into a comfortable
chair facing that gentlemen

You are Phineas C Gooch attorneyatlaw said the visitor his
tone of voice and inflection making his words at once a question an
assertion and an accusation

Before committing himself by a reply the lawyer estimated his
possible client in one of his brief but shrewd and calculating
glances

The man was of the emphatic typelargesized active bold and
debonair in demeanour vain beyond a doubt slightly swaggering ready
and at ease He was wellclothed but with a shade too much
ornateness He was seeking a lawyer but if that fact would seem to
saddle him with troubles they were not patent in his beaming eye and
courageous air

My name is Gooch at length the lawyer admitted Upon pressure he
would also have confessed to the Phineas C But he did not consider it
good practice to volunteer information I did not receive your
card he continued by way of rebuke so I

I know you didnt remarked the visitor coolly And you wont just
yet Light up He threw a leg over an arm of his chair and tossed
a handful of richhued cigars upon the table Lawyer Gooch knew the
brand He thawed just enough to accept the invitation to smoke

You are a divorce lawyer said the cardless visitor This time there
was no interrogation in his voice Nor did his words constitute a
simple assertion They formed a chargea denunciationas one would
say to a dog You are a dog Lawyer Gooch was silent under the
imputation

You handle continued the visitor all the various ramifications of
bustedup connubiality You are a surgeon we might saw who extracts
Cupids darts when he shoots em into the wrong parties You furnish
patent incandescent lights for premises where the torch of Hymen has
burned so low you cant light a cigar at it Am I right Mr Gooch

I have undertaken cases said the lawyer guardedly in the line to
which your figurative speech seems to refer Do you wish to consult me
professionally Mr The lawyer paused with significance

Not yet said the other with an arch wave of his cigar not just
yet Let us approach the subject with the caution that should have
been used in the original act that makes this powwow necessary
There exists a matrimonial jumble to be straightened out But before
I give you names I want your honestwell anyhow your professional
opinion on the merits of the mixup I want you to size up the
catastropheabstractlyyou understand Im Mr Nobody and Ive got
a story to tell you Then you say whats what Do you get my
wireless

You want to state a hypothetical case suggested Lawyer Gooch

Thats the word I was after Apothecary was the best shot I could
make at it in my mind The hypothetical goes Ill state the case
Suppose theres a womana deuced finelooking womanwho has run
away from her husband and home Shes badly mashed on another man who
went to her town to work up some real estate business Now we may as
well call this womans husband Thomas R Billings for thats his
name Im giving you straight tips on the cognomens The Lothario
chap is Henry K Jessup The Billingses lived in a little town called
Susanvillea good many miles from here Now Jessup leaves
Susanville two weeks ago The next day Mrs Billings follows him
Shes dead gone on this man Jessup you can bet your law library on
that

Lawyer Goochs client said this with such unctuous satisfaction that
even the callous lawyer experienced a slight ripple of repulsion He
now saw clearly in his fatuous visitor the conceit of the ladykiller
the egoistic complacency of the successful trifler

Now continued the visitor suppose this Mrs Billings wasnt happy
at home Well say she and her husband didnt gee worth a cent
Theyve got incompatibility to burn The things she likes Billings
wouldnt have as a gift with tradingstamps Its Tabby and Rover
with them all the time Shes an educated woman in science and
culture and she reads things out loud at meetings Billings is not
on He dont appreciate progress and obelisks and ethics and
things of that sort Old Billings is simply a blink when it comes to
such things The lady is out and out above his class Now lawyer
dont it look like a fair equalization of rights and wrongs that a
woman like that should be allowed to throw down Billings and take the
man that can appreciate her

Incompatibility said Lawyer Gooch is undoubtedly the source of
much marital discord and unhappiness Where it is positively proved
divorce would seem to be the equitable remedy Are youexcuse meis
this man Jessup one to whom the lady may safely trust her future

Oh you can bet on Jessup said the client with a confident wag of
his head Jessups all right Hell do the square thing Why he
left Susanville just to keep people from talking about Mrs Billings
But she followed him up and now of course hell stick to her
When she gets a divorce all legal and proper Jessup will do the
proper thing

And now said Lawyer Gooch continuing the hypothesis if you
prefer and supposing that my services should be desired in the case
what

The client rose impulsively to his feet

Oh dang the hypothetical business he exclaimed impatiently
Lets let her drop and get down to straight talk You ought to know
who I am by this time I want that woman to have her divorce Ill
pay for it The day you set Mrs Billings free Ill pay you five
hundred dollars

Lawyer Goochs client banged his fist upon the table to punctuate his
generosity

If that is the case began the lawyer

Lady to see you sir bawled Archibald bouncing in from his
anteroom He had orders to always announce immediately any client
that might come There was no sense in turning business away

Lawyer Gooch took client number one by the arm and led him suavely
into one of the adjoining rooms Favour me by remaining here a few
minutes sir said he I will return and resume our consultation
with the least possible delay I am rather expecting a visit from a
very wealthy old lady in connection with a will I will not keep you
waiting long

The breezy gentleman seated himself with obliging acquiescence and
took up a magazine The lawyer returned to the middle office
carefully closing behind him the connecting door

Show the lady in Archibald he said to the office boy who was
awaiting the order

A tall lady of commanding presence and sternly handsome entered
the room She wore robesrobes not clothesample and fluent
In her eye could be perceived the lambent flame of genius and soul
In her hand was a green bag of the capacity of a bushel and an
umbrella that also seemed to wear a robe ample and fluent She
accepted a chair

Are you Mr Phineas C Gooch the lawyer she asked in formal and
unconciliatory tones

I am answered Lawyer Gooch without circumlocution He never
circumlocuted when dealing with a woman Women circumlocute Time is
wasted when both sides in debate employ the same tactics

As a lawyer sir began the lady you may have acquired some
knowledge of the human heart Do you believe that the pusillanimous
and petty conventions of our artificial social life should stand as an
obstacle in the way of a noble and affectionate heart when it finds
its true mate among the miserable and worthless wretches in the world
that are called men

Madam said Lawyer Gooch in the tone that he used in curbing his
female clients this is an office for conducting the practice of law
I am a lawyer not a philosopher nor the editor of an Answers to the
Lovelorn column of a newspaper I have other clients waiting I
will ask you kindly to come to the point

Well you neednt get so stiff around the gills about it said the
lady with a snap of her luminous eyes and a startling gyration of her
umbrella Business is what Ive come for I want your opinion in
the matter of a suit for divorce as the vulgar would call it but
which is really only the readjustment of the false and ignoble
conditions that the shortsighted laws of man have interposed between
a loving

I beg your pardon madam interrupted Lawyer Gooch with some
impatience for reminding you again that this is a law office
Perhaps Mrs Wilcox

Mrs Wilcox is all right cut in the lady with a hint of asperity
And so are Tolstoi and Mrs Gertrude Atherton and Omar Khayyam and
Mr Edward Bok Ive read em all I would like to discuss with you
the divine right of the soul as opposed to the freedomdestroying
restrictions of a bigoted and narrowminded society But I will
proceed to business I would prefer to lay the matter before you in
an impersonal way until you pass upon its merits That is to describe
it as a supposable instance without

You wish to state a hypothetical case said Lawyer Gooch

I was going to say that said the lady sharply Now suppose there
is a woman who is all soul and heart and aspirations for a complete
existence This woman has a husband who is far below her in intellect
in tastein everything Bah he is a brute He despises literature
He sneers at the lofty thoughts of the worlds great thinkers He
thinks only of real estate and such sordid things He is no mate for a
woman with soul We will say that this unfortunate wife one day meets
with her ideala man with brain and heart and force She loves him
Although this man feels the thrill of a newfound affinity he is too
noble too honourable to declare himself He flies from the presence
of his beloved She flies after him trampling with superb
indifference upon the fetters with which an unenlightened social
system would bind her Now what will a divorce cost Eliza Ann
Timmins the poetess of Sycamore Gap got one for three hundred and
forty dollars Can II mean can this lady I speak of get one that
cheap

Madam said Lawyer Gooch your last two or three sentences delight
me with their intelligence and clearness Can we not now abandon the
hypothetical and come down to names and business

I should say so exclaimed the lady adopting the practical with
admirable readiness Thomas R Billings is the name of the low
brute who stands between the happiness of his legalhis legal but
not his spiritualwife and Henry K Jessup the noble man whom
nature intended for her mate I concluded the client with an air
of dramatic revelation am Mrs Billings

Gentlemen to see you sir shouted Archibald invading the room
almost at a handspring Lawyer Gooch arose from his chair

Mrs Billings he said courteously allow me to conduct you into
the adjoining office apartment for a few minutes I am expecting a
very wealthy old gentleman on business connected with a will In a
very short while I will join you and continue our consultation

With his accustomed chivalrous manner Lawyer Gooch ushered his
soulful client into the remaining unoccupied room and came out
closing the door with circumspection

The next visitor introduced by Archibald was a thin nervous
irritablelooking man of middle age with a worried and apprehensive
expression of countenance He carried in one hand a small satchel
which he set down upon the floor beside the chair which the lawyer
placed for him His clothing was of good quality but it was worn
without regard to neatness or style and appeared to be covered with
the dust of travel

You make a specialty of divorce cases he said in an agitated but
businesslike tone

I may say began Lawyer Gooch that my practice has not
altogether avoided

I know you do interrupted client number three You neednt tell
me Ive heard all about you I have a case to lay before you
without necessarily disclosing any connection that I might have with
itthat is

You wish said Lawyer Gooch to state a hypothetical case

You may call it that I am a plain man of business I will be as
brief as possible We will first take up hypothetical woman We will
say she is married uncongenially In many ways she is a superior
woman Physically she is considered to be handsome She is devoted
to what she calls literaturepoetry and prose and such stuff Her
husband is a plain man in the business walks of life Their home has
not been happy although the husband has tried to make it so Some
time ago a mana strangercame to the peaceful town in which
they lived and engaged in some real estate operations This woman met
him and became unaccountably infatuated with him Her attentions
became so open that the man felt the community to be no safe place for
him so he left it She abandoned husband and home and followed him
She forsook her home where she was provided with every comfort to
follow this man who had inspired her with such a strange affection
Is there anything more to be deplored concluded the client in a
trembling voice than the wrecking of a home by a womans
uncalculating folly

Lawyer Gooch delivered the cautious opinion that there was not

This man she has gone to join resumed the visitor is not the man
to make her happy It is a wild and foolish selfdeception that makes
her think he will Her husband in spite of their many disagreements
is the only one capable of dealing with her sensitive and peculiar
nature But this she does not realize now

Would you consider a divorce the logical cure in the case you
present asked Lawyer Gooch who felt that the conversation was
wandering too far from the field of business

A divorce exclaimed the client feelinglyalmost tearfully
No nonot that I have read Mr Gooch of many instances where
your sympathy and kindly interest led you to act as a mediator
between estranged husband and wife and brought them together again
Let us drop the hypothetical caseI need conceal no longer that it
is I who am the sufferer in this sad affairthe names you shall
haveThomas R Billings and wifeand Henry K Jessup the man
with whom she is infatuated

Client number three laid his hand upon Mr Goochs arm Deep emotion
was written upon his careworn face For Heavens sake he said
fervently help me in this hour of trouble Seek out Mrs Billings
and persuade her to abandon this distressing pursuit of her lamentable
folly Tell her Mr Gooch that her husband is willing to receive
her back to his heart and homepromise her anything that will
induce her to return I have heard of your success in these matters
Mrs Billings cannot be very far away I am worn out with travel
and weariness Twice during the pursuit I saw her but various
circumstances prevented our having an interview Will you undertake
this mission for me Mr Gooch and earn my everlasting gratitude

It is true said Lawyer Gooch frowning slightly at the others last
words but immediately calling up an expression of virtuous
benevolence that on a number of occasions I have been successful in
persuading couples who sought the severing of their matrimonial bonds
to think better of their rash intentions and return to their homes
reconciled But I assure you that the work is often exceedingly
difficult The amount of argument perseverance and if I may be
allowed to say it eloquence that it requires would astonish you But
this is a case in which my sympathies would be wholly enlisted I
feel deeply for you sir and I would be most happy to see husband and
wife reunited But my time concluded the lawyer looking at his
watch as if suddenly reminded of the fact is valuable

I am aware of that said the client and if you will take the case
and persuade Mrs Billings to return home and leave the man alone that
she is followingon that day I will pay you the sum of one thousand
dollars I have made a little money in real estate during the recent
boom in Susanville and I will not begrudge that amount

Retain your seat for a few moments please said Lawyer Gooch
arising and again consulting his watch I have another client
waiting in an adjoining room whom I had very nearly forgotten I will
return in the briefest possible space

The situation was now one that fully satisfied Lawyer Goochs love of
intricacy and complication He revelled in cases that presented such
subtle problems and possibilities It pleased him to think that he
was master of the happiness and fate of the three individuals who sat
unconscious of one anothers presence within his reach His old
figure of the ship glided into his mind But now the figure failed
for to have filled every compartment of an actual vessel would have
been to endanger her safety with his compartments full his ship of
affairs could but sail on to the advantageous port of a fine fat fee
The thing for him to do of course was to wring the best bargain he
could from some one of his anxious cargo

First he called to the office boy Lock the outer door Archibald
and admit no one Then he moved with long silent strides into the
room in which client number one waited That gentleman sat patiently
scanning the pictures in the magazine with a cigar in his mouth and
his feet upon a table

Well he remarked cheerfully as the lawyer entered have you made
up your mind Does five hundred dollars go for getting the fair lady
a divorce

You mean that as a retainer asked Lawyer Gooch softly
interrogative

Hey No for the whole job Its enough aint it

My fee said Lawyer Gooch would be one thousand five hundred
dollars Five hundred dollars down and the remainder upon issuance
of the divorce

A loud whistle came from client number one His feet descended to the
floor

Guess we cant close the deal he said arising I cleaned up five
hundred dollars in a little real estate dicker down in Susanville
Id do anything I could to free the lady but it outsizes my pile

Could you stand one thousand two hundred dollars asked the lawyer
insinuatingly

Five hundred is my limit I tell you Guess Ill have to hunt up a
cheaper lawyer The client put on his hat

Out this way please said Lawyer Gooch opening the door that led
into the hallway

As the gentleman flowed out of the compartment and down the stairs
Lawyer Gooch smiled to himself Exit Mr Jessup he murmured as he
fingered the Henry Clay tuft of hair at his ear And now for the
forsaken husband He returned to the middle office and assumed a
businesslike manner

I understand he said to client number three that you agree to pay
one thousand dollars if I bring about or am instrumental in bringing
about the return of Mrs Billings to her home and her abandonment of
her infatuated pursuit of the man for whom she has conceived such a
violent fancy Also that the case is now unreservedly in my hands on
that basis Is that correct

Entirely said the other eagerly And I can produce the cash any
time at two hours notice

Lawyer Gooch stood up at his full height His thin figure seemed to
expand His thumbs sought the armholes of his vest Upon his face
was a look of sympathetic benignity that he always wore during such
undertakings

Then sir he said in kindly tones I think I can promise you an
early relief from your troubles I have that much confidence in my
powers of argument and persuasion in the natural impulses of the
human heart toward good and in the strong influence of a husbands
unfaltering love Mrs Billings sir is herein that room the
lawyers long arm pointed to the door I will call her in at once
and our united pleadings

Lawyer Gooch paused for client number three had leaped from his chair
as if propelled by steel springs and clutched his satchel

What the devil he exclaimed harshly do you mean That woman in
there I thought I shook her off forty miles back

He ran to the open window looked out below and threw one leg over
the sill

Stop cried Lawyer Gooch in amazement What would you do Come
Mr Billings and face your erring but innocent wife Our combined
entreaties cannot fail to

Billings shouted the now thoroughly moved client Ill Billings
you you old idiot

Turning he hurled his satchel with fury at the lawyers head It
struck that astounded peacemaker between the eyes causing him to
stagger backward a pace or two When Lawyer Gooch recovered his wits
he saw that his client had disappeared Rushing to the window he
leaned out and saw the recreant gathering himself up from the top of
a shed upon which he had dropped from the secondstory window
Without stopping to collect his hat he then plunged downward the
remaining ten feet to the alley up which he flew with prodigious
celerity until the surrounding building swallowed him up from view

Lawyer Gooch passed his hand tremblingly across his brow It was a
habitual act with him serving to clear his thoughts Perhaps also it
now seemed to soothe the spot where a very hard alligatorhide satchel
had struck

The satchel lay upon the floor wide open with its contents spilled
about Mechanically Lawyer Gooch stooped to gather up the articles
The first was a collar and the omniscient eye of the man of law
perceived wonderingly the initials H K J marked upon it Then
came a comb a brush a folded map and a piece of soap Lastly a
handful of old business letters addressedevery one of themto
Henry K Jessup Esq

Lawyer Gooch closed the satchel and set it upon the table He
hesitated for a moment and then put on his hat and walked into the
office boys anteroom

Archibald he said mildly as he opened the hall door I am going
around to the Supreme Court rooms In five minutes you may step into
the inner office and inform the lady who is waiting there that

CALLOWAYS CODE


The New York _Enterprise_ sent H B Calloway as special correspondent
to the RussoJapanesePortsmouth war

For two months Calloway hung about Yokohama and Tokio shaking dice
with the other correspondents for drinks of rickshawsoh no
thats something to ride in anyhow he wasnt earning the salary
that his paper was paying him But that was not Calloways fault
The little brown men who held the strings of Fate between their
fingers were not ready for the readers of the _Enterprise_ to season
their breakfast bacon and eggs with the battles of the descendants of
the gods

But soon the column of correspondents that were to go out with the
First Army tightened their fieldglass belts and went down to the
Yalu with Kuroki Calloway was one of these

Now this is no history of the battle of the Yalu River That has
been told in detail by the correspondents who gazed at the shrapnel
smoke rings from a distance of three miles But for justices sake
let it be understood that the Japanese commander prohibited a nearer
view

Calloways feat was accomplished before the battle What he did was
to furnish the _Enterprise_ with the biggest beat of the war That
paper published exclusively and in detail the news of the attack on
the lines of the Russian General on the same day that it was made
No other paper printed a word about it for two days afterward except
a London paper whose account was absolutely incorrect and untrue

Calloway did this in face of the fact that General Kuroki was making
his moves and laying his plans with the profoundest secrecy as far
as the world outside his camps was concerned The correspondents
were forbidden to send out any news whatever of his plans and every
message that was allowed on the wires was censored with rigid
severity

The correspondent for the London paper handed in a cablegram
describing Kurokis plans but as it was wrong from beginning to end
the censor grinned and let it go through

So there they wereKuroki on one side of the Yalu with fortytwo
thousand infantry five thousand cavalry and one hundred and
twentyfour guns On the other side Zassulitch waited for him with
only twentythree thousand men and with a long stretch of river to
guard And Calloway had got hold of some important inside information
that he knew would bring the _Enterprise_ staff around a cablegram as
thick as flies around a Park Row lemonade stand If he could only get
that message past the censorthe new censor who had arrived and
taken his post that day

Calloway did the obviously proper thing He lit his pipe and sat down
on a gun carriage to think it over And there we must leave him for
the rest of the story belongs to Vesey a sixteendollaraweek
reporter on the _Enterprise_


Calloways cablegram was handed to the managing editor at four
oclock in the afternoon He read it three times and then drew a
pocket mirror from a pigeonhole in his desk and looked at his
reflection carefully Then he went over to the desk of Boyd his
assistant he usually called Boyd when he wanted him and laid the
cablegram before him

Its from Calloway he said See what you make of it

The message was dated at Wiju and these were the words of it


 Foregone preconcerted rash witching goes muffled rumour mine dark
 silent unfortunate richmond existing great hotly brute select
 mooted parlous beggars ye angel incontrovertible


Boyd read it twice

Its either a cipher or a sunstroke said he

Ever hear of anything like a code in the officea secret code
asked the m e who had held his desk for only two years Managing
editors come and go

None except the vernacular that the lady specials write in said
Boyd Couldnt be an acrostic could it

I thought of that said the m e but the beginning letters
contain only four vowels It must be a code of some sort

Try em in groups suggested Boyd Lets seeRash witching
goesnot with me it doesnt Muffled rumour minemust
have an underground wire Dark silent unfortunate richmondno
reason why he should knock that town so hard Existing great
hotlyno it doesnt pan out Ill call Scott

The city editor came in a hurry and tried his luck A city editor
must know something about everything so Scott knew a little about
cipherwriting

It may be what is called an inverted alphabet cipher said he
Ill try that R seems to be the oftenest used initial letter
with the exception of m Assuming r to mean e the most
frequently used vowel we transpose the lettersso

Scott worked rapidly with his pencil for two minutes and then showed
the first word according to his readingthe word Scejtzez

Great cried Boyd Its a charade My first is a Russian
general Go on Scott

No that wont work said the city editor Its undoubtedly a
code Its impossible to read it without the key Has the office
ever used a cipher code

Just what I was asking said the me Hustle everybody up that
ought to know We must get at it some way Calloway has evidently
got hold of something big and the censor has put the screws on or
he wouldnt have cabled in a lot of chop suey like this

Throughout the office of the _Enterprise_ a dragnet was sent hauling
in such members of the staff as would be likely to know of a code
past or present by reason of their wisdom information natural
intelligence or length of servitude They got together in a group
in the city room with the m e in the centre No one had heard
of a code All began to explain to the head investigator that
newspapers never use a code anyhowthat is a cipher code Of
course the Associated Press stuff is a sort of codean abbreviation
ratherbut

The m e knew all that and said so He asked each man how long he
had worked on the paper Not one of them had drawn pay from an
_Enterprise_ envelope for longer than six years Calloway had been on
the paper twelve years

Try old Heffelbauer said the m e He was here when Park Row was
a potato patch

Heffelbauer was an institution He was half janitor half handyman
about the office and half watchmanthus becoming the peer of
thirteen and onehalf tailors Sent for he came radiating his
nationality

Heffelbauer said the m e did you ever hear of a code belonging
to the office a long time agoa private code You know what a code
is dont you

Yah said Heffelbauer Sure I know vat a code is Yah apout
dwelf or fifteen year ago der office had a code Der reborters in der
cityroom haf it here

Ah said the m e Were getting on the trail now Where was it
kept Heffelbauer What do you know about it

Somedimes said the retainer dey keep it in der little room
behind der library room

Can you find it asked the m e eagerly Do you know where it is

Mein Gott said Heffelbauer How long you dink a code live Der
reborters call him a maskeet But von day he butt mit his head der
editor und

Oh hes talking about a goat said Boyd Get out Heffelbauer

Again discomfited the concerted wit and resource of the _Enterprise_
huddled around Calloways puzzle considering its mysterious words
in vain

Then Vesey came in

Vesey was the youngest reporter He had a thirtytwoinch chest and
wore a number fourteen collar but his bright Scotch plaid suit gave
him presence and conferred no obscurity upon his whereabouts He
wore his hat in such a position that people followed him about to see
him take it off convinced that it must be hung upon a peg driven
into the back of his head He was never without an immense knotted
hardwood cane with a Germansilver tip on its crooked handle Vesey
was the best photograph hustler in the office Scott said it was
because no living human being could resist the personal triumph it
was to hand his picture over to Vesey Vesey always wrote his own
news stories except the big ones which were sent to the rewrite
men Add to this fact that among all the inhabitants temples and
groves of the earth nothing existed that could abash Vesey and his
dim sketch is concluded

Vesey butted into the circle of cipher readers very much as
Heffelbauers code would have done and asked what was up Some
one explained with the touch of halffamiliar condescension that
they always used toward him Vesey reached out and took the
cablegram from the m es hand Under the protection of some
special Providence he was always doing appalling things like that
and coming off unscathed

Its a code said Vesey Anybody got the key

The office has no code said Boyd reaching for the message Vesey
held to it

Then old Calloway expects us to read it anyhow said he Hes up
a tree or something and hes made this up so as to get it by the
censor Its up to us Gee I wish they had sent me too Saywe
cant afford to fall down on our end of it Foregone preconcerted
rash witchinghm

Vesey sat down on a table corner and began to whistle softly
frowning at the cablegram

Lets have it please said the m e Weve got to get to work on
it

I believe Ive got a line on it said Vesey Give me ten
minutes

He walked to his desk threw his hat into a wastebasket spread out
flat on his chest like a gorgeous lizard and started his pencil
going The wit and wisdom of the _Enterprise_ remained in a loose
group and smiled at one another nodding their heads toward Vesey
Then they began to exchange their theories about the cipher

It took Vesey exactly fifteen minutes He brought to the m e a pad
with the codekey written on it

I felt the swing of it as soon as I saw it said Vesey Hurrah for
old Calloway Hes done the Japs and every paper in town that prints
literature instead of news Take a look at that

Thus had Vesey set forth the reading of the code

 Foregone  conclusion
 Preconcerted  arrangement
 Rash  act
 Witching  hour of midnight
 Goes  without saying
 Muffled  report
 Rumour  hath it
 Mine  host
 Dark  horse
 Silent  majority
 Unfortunate  pedestrians
 Richmond  in the field
 Existing  conditions
 Great  White Way
 Hotly  contested
 Brute  force
 Select  few
 Mooted  question
 Parlous  times
 Beggars  description
 Ye  correspondent
 Angel  unawares
 Incontrovertible  fact

 Mr Vesey afterward explained that the logical journalistic
 complement of the word unfortunate was once the word
 victim But since the automobile became so popular the
 correct following word is now pedestrians Of course in
 Calloways code it meant infantry

Its simply newspaper English explained Vesey Ive been
reporting on the _Enterprise_ long enough to know it by heart Old
Calloway gives us the cue word and we use the word that naturally
follows it just as we use em in the paper Read it over and youll
see how pat they drop into their places Now heres the message he
intended us to get

Vesey handed out another sheet of paper

 Concluded arrangement to act at hour of midnight
 without saying Report hath it that a large body of
 cavalry and an overwhelming force of infantry will be
 thrown into the field Conditions white Way contested
 by only a small force Question the Times description
 Its correspondent is unaware of the facts

Great stuff cried Boyd excitedly Kuroki crosses the Yalu
tonight and attacks Oh we wont do a thing to the sheets that make
up with Addisons essays real estate transfers and bowling scores

Mr Vesey said the m e with his jollyingwhichyoushouldregard
asafavour manner you have cast a serious reflection upon the
literary standards of the paper that employs you You have also
assisted materially in giving us the biggest beat of the year I
will let you know in a day or two whether you are to be discharged or
retained at a larger salary Somebody send Ames to me

Ames was the kingpin the snowypetalled Marguerite the starbright
looloo of the rewrite men He saw attempted murder in the pains of
greenapple colic cyclones in the summer zephyr lost children in
every topspinning urchin an uprising of the downtrodden masses in
every hurling of a derelict potato at a passing automobile When not
rewriting Ames sat on the porch of his Brooklyn villa playing
checkers with his tenyearold son

Ames and the war editor shut themselves in a room There was a map
in there stuck full of little pins that represented armies and
divisions Their fingers had been itching for days to move those
pins along the crooked line of the Yalu They did so now and in
words of fire Ames translated Calloways brief message into a front
page masterpiece that set the world talking He told of the secret
councils of the Japanese officers gave Kurokis flaming speeches in
full counted the cavalry and infantry to a man and a horse
described the quick and silent building of the bridge at Suikauchen
across which the Mikados legions were hurled upon the surprised
Zassulitch whose troops were widely scattered along the river And
the battlewell you know what Ames can do with a battle if you give
him just one smell of smoke for a foundation And in the same story
with seemingly supernatural knowledge he gleefully scored the most
profound and ponderous paper in England for the false and misleading
account of the intended movements of the Japanese First Army printed
in its issue of _the same date_

Only one error was made and that was the fault of the cable operator
at Wiju Calloway pointed it out after he came back The word
great in his code should have been gage and its complemental
words of battle But it went to Ames conditions white and of
course he took that to mean snow His description of the Japanese
army struggling through the snowstorm blinded by the whirling flakes
was thrillingly vivid The artists turned out some effective
illustrations that made a hit as pictures of the artillery dragging
their guns through the drifts But as the attack was made on the
first day of May conditions white excited some amusement But it
in made no difference to the _Enterprise_ anyway

It was wonderful And Calloway was wonderful in having made the new
censor believe that his jargon of words meant no more than a
complaint of the dearth of news and a petition for more expense
money And Vesey was wonderful And most wonderful of all are
words and how they make friends one with another being oft
associated until not even obituary notices them do part


On the second day following the city editor halted at Veseys desk
where the reporter was writing the story of a man who had broken his
leg by falling into a coalholeAmes having failed to find a
murder motive in it

The old man says your salary is to be raised to twenty a week said
Scott

All right said Vesey Every little helps SayMr Scott
which would you sayWe can state without fear of successful
contradiction or On the whole it can be safely asserted




V

A MATTER OF MEAN ELEVATION


One winter the Alcazar Opera Company of New Orleans made a speculative
trip along the Mexican Central American and South American coasts
The venture proved a most successful one The musicloving
impressionable SpanishAmericans deluged the company with dollars and
vivas The manager waxed plump and amiable But for the
prohibitive climate he would have put forth the distinctive flower of
his prosperitythe overcoat of fur braided frogged and opulent
Almost was he persuaded to raise the salaries of his company But
with a mighty effort he conquered the impulse toward such an
unprofitable effervescence of joy

At Macuto on the coast of Venezuela the company scored its greatest
success Imagine Coney Island translated into Spanish and you will
comprehend Macuto The fashionable season is from November to March
Down from La Guayra and Caracas and Valencia and other interior towns
flock the people for their holiday season There are bathing and
fiestas and bull fights and scandal And then the people have a
passion for music that the bands in the plaza and on the sea beach
stir but do not satisfy The coming of the Alcazar Opera Company
aroused the utmost ardour and zeal among the pleasure seekers

The illustrious Guzman Blanco President and Dictator of Venezuela
sojourned in Macuto with his court for the season That potent ruler
who himself paid a subsidy of 40000 pesos each year to grand opera
in Caracasordered one of the Government warehouses to be cleared
for a temporary theatre A stage was quickly constructed and rough
wooden benches made for the audience Private boxes were added for
the use of the President and the notables of the army and Government

The company remained in Macuto for two weeks Each performance filled
the house as closely as it could be packed Then the musicmad people
fought for room in the open doors and windows and crowded about
hundreds deep on the outside Those audiences formed a brilliantly
diversified patch of colour The hue of their faces ranged from the
clear olive of the pureblood Spaniards down through the yellow and
brown shades of the Mestizos to the coalblack Carib and the Jamaica
Negro Scattered among them were little groups of Indians with faces
like stone idols wrapped in gaudy fibrewoven blanketsIndians
down from the mountain states of Zamora and Los Andes and Miranda to
trade their gold dust in the coast towns

The spell cast upon these denizens of the interior fastnesses was
remarkable They sat in petrified ecstasy conspicuous among the
excitable Macutians who wildly strove with tongue and hand to give
evidence of their delight Only once did the sombre rapture of these
aboriginals find expression During the rendition of Faust Guzman
Blanco extravagantly pleased by the Jewel Song cast upon the stage
a purse of gold pieces Other distinguished citizens followed his lead
to the extent of whatever loose coin they had convenient while some
of the fair and fashionable senoras were moved in imitation to
fling a jewel or a ring or two at the feet of the Margueritewho
was according to the bills Mlle Nina Giraud Then from different
parts of the house rose sundry of the stolid hillmen and cast upon the
stage little brown and dun bags that fell with soft thumps and did
not rebound It was no doubt pleasure at the tribute to her art
that caused Mlle Girauds eyes to shine so brightly when she opened
these little deerskin bags in her dressing room and found them to
contain pure gold dust If so the pleasure was rightly hers for her
voice in song pure strong and thrilling with the feeling of the
emotional artist deserved the tribute that it earned

But the triumph of the Alcazar Opera Company is not the themeit
but leans upon and colours it There happened in Macuto a tragic
thing an unsolvable mystery that sobered for a time the gaiety of
the happy season

One evening between the short twilight and the time when she should
have whirled upon the stage in the red and black of the ardent Carmen
Mlle Nina Giraud disappeared from the sight and ken of 6000 pairs
of eyes and as many minds in Macuto There was the usual turmoil and
hurrying to seek her Messengers flew to the little Frenchkept hotel
where she stayed others of the company hastened here or there where
she might be lingering in some tienda or unduly prolonging her bath
upon the beach All search was fruitless Mademoiselle had
vanished

Half an hour passed and she did not appear The dictator unused to
the caprices of prime donne became impatient He sent an aide from
his box to say to the manager that if the curtain did not at once rise
he would immediately hale the entire company to the calabosa though
it would desolate his heart indeed to be compelled to such an act
Birds in Macuto could be made to sing

The manager abandoned hope for the time of Mlle Giraud A member of
the chorus who had dreamed hopelessly for years of the blessed
opportunity quickly Carmenized herself and the opera went on

Afterward when the lost cantatrice appeared not the aid of the
authorities was invoked The President at once set the army the
police and all citizens to the search Not one clue to Mlle Girauds
disappearance was found The Alcazar left to fill engagements farther
down the coast

On the way back the steamer stopped at Macuto and the manager made
anxious inquiry Not a trace of the lady had been discovered The
Alcazar could do no more The personal belongings of the missing lady
were stored in the hotel against her possible later reappearance and
the opera company continued upon its homeward voyage to New Orleans

     

On the camino real along the beach the two saddle mules and the four
pack mules of Don Senor Johnny Armstrong stood patiently awaiting the
crack of the whip of the _arriero_ Luis That would be the signal for
the start on another long journey into the mountains The pack mules
were loaded with a varied assortment of hardware and cutlery These
articles Don Johnny traded to the interior Indians for the gold dust
that they washed from the Andean streams and stored in quills and bags
against his coming It was a profitable business and Senor Armstrong
expected soon to be able to purchase the coffee plantation that he
coveted

Armstrong stood on the narrow sidewalk exchanging garbled Spanish
with old Peralto the rich native merchant who had just charged him
four prices for half a gross of potmetal hatchets and abridged
English with Rucker the little German who was Consul for the United
States

Take with you senor said Peralto the blessings of the saints
upon your journey

Better try quinine growled Rucker through his pipe Take two
grains every night And dont make your trip too long Johnny
because we haf needs of you It is ein villainous game dot Melville
play of whist and dere is no oder substitute _Auf wiedersehen_ und
keep your eyes dot mules ears between when you on der edge of der
brecipices ride

The bells of Luiss mule jingled and the pack train filed after the
warning note Armstrong waved a goodbye and took his place at the
tail of the procession Up the narrow street they turned and passed
the twostory wooden Hotel Ingles where Ives and Dawson and Richards
and the rest of the chaps were dawdling on the broad piazza reading
weekold newspapers They crowded to the railing and shouted many
friendly and wise and foolish farewells after him Across the plaza
they trotted slowly past the bronze statue of Guzman Blanco within
its fence of bayoneted rifles captured from revolutionists and out
of the town between the rows of thatched huts swarming with the
unclothed youth of Macuto They plunged into the damp coolness of
banana groves at length to emerge upon a bright stream where brown
women in scant raiment laundered clothes destructively upon the rocks
Then the pack train fording the stream attacked the sudden ascent
and bade adieu to such civilization as the coast afforded

For weeks Armstrong guided by Luis followed his regular route among
the mountains After he had collected an arroba of the precious
metal winning a profit of nearly 5000 the heads of the lightened
mules were turned downtrail again Where the head of the Guarico
River springs from a great gash in the mountainside Luis halted the
train

Half a days journey from here Senor said he is the village of
Tacuzama which we have never visited I think many ounces of gold may
be procured there It is worth the trial

Armstrong concurred and they turned again upward toward Tacuzama
The trail was abrupt and precipitous mounting through a dense
forest As night fell dark and gloomy Luis once more halted
Before them was a black chasm bisecting the path as far as they could
see

Luis dismounted There should be a bridge he called and ran along
the cleft a distance It is here he cried and remounting led the
way In a few moments Armstrong heard a sound as though a thunderous
drum were beating somewhere in the dark It was the falling of the
mules hoofs upon the bridge made of strong hides lashed to poles and
stretched across the chasm Half a mile further was Tacuzama The
village was a congregation of rock and mud huts set in the
profundity of an obscure wood As they rode in a sound inconsistent
with that brooding solitude met their ears From a long low mud hut
that they were nearing rose the glorious voice of a woman in song
The words were English the air familiar to Armstrongs memory but
not to his musical knowledge

He slipped from his mule and stole to a narrow window in one end of
the house Peering cautiously inside he saw within three feet of
him a woman of marvellous imposing beauty clothed in a splendid
loose robe of leopard skins The hut was packed close to the small
space in which she stood with the squatting figures of Indians

The woman finished her song and seated herself close to the little
window as if grateful for the unpolluted air that entered it
When she had ceased several of the audience rose and cast little
softlyfalling bags at her feet A harsh murmurno doubt a
barbarous kind of applause and commentwent through the grim
assembly

Armstrong was used to seizing opportunities promptly Taking
advantage of the noise he called to the woman in a low but distinct
voice Do not turn your head this way but listen I am an American
If you need assistance tell me how I can render it Answer as briefly
as you can

The woman was worthy of his boldness Only by a sudden flush of her
pale cheek did she acknowledge understanding of his words Then she
spoke scarcely moving her lips

I am held a prisoner by these Indians God knows I need help In
two hours come to the little hut twenty yards toward the Mountainside
There will be a light and a red curtain in the window There is
always a guard at the door whom you will have to overcome For the
love of heaven do not fail to come

The story seems to shrink from adventure and rescue and mystery The
theme is one too gentle for those brave and quickening tones And yet
it reaches as far back as time itself It has been named
environment which is as weak a word as any to express the
unnameable kinship of man to nature that queer fraternity that causes
stones and trees and salt water and clouds to play upon our emotions
Why are we made serious and solemn and sublime by mountain heights
grave and contemplative by an abundance of overhanging trees
reduced to inconstancy and monkey capers by the ripples on a sandy
beach Did the protoplasmbut enough The chemists are looking
into the matter and before long they will have all life in the table
of the symbols

Briefly then in order to confine the story within scientific bounds
John Armstrong went to the hut choked the Indian guard and carried
away Mlle Giraud With her was also conveyed a number of pounds of
gold dust she had collected during her six months forced engagement
in Tacuzama The Carabobo Indians are easily the most enthusiastic
lovers of music between the equator and the French Opera House in New
Orleans They are also strong believers that the advice of Emerson
was good when he said The thing thou wantest O discontented man
take it and pay the price A number of them had attended the
performance of the Alcazar Opera Company in Macuto and found Mlle
Girauds style and technique satisfactory They wanted her so they
took her one evening suddenly and without any fuss They treated her
with much consideration exacting only one song recital each day She
was quite pleased at being rescued by Mr Armstrong So much for
mystery and adventure Now to resume the theory of the protoplasm

John Armstrong and Mlle Giraud rode among the Andean peaks enveloped
in their greatness and sublimity The mightiest cousins furthest
removed in natures great family become conscious of the tie Among
those huge piles of primordial upheaval amid those gigantic silences
and elongated fields of distance the littlenesses of men are
precipitated as one chemical throws down a sediment from another
They moved reverently as in a temple Their souls were uplifted in
unison with the stately heights They travelled in a zone of majesty
and peace

To Armstrong the woman seemed almost a holy thing Yet bathed in the
white still dignity of her martyrdom that purified her earthly beauty
and gave out it seemed an aura of transcendent loveliness in those
first hours of companionship she drew from him an adoration that was
half human love half the worship of a descended goddess

Never yet since her rescue had she smiled Over her dress she still
wore the robe of leopard skins for the mountain air was cold She
looked to be some splendid princess belonging to those wild and
awesome altitudes The spirit of the region chimed with hers Her
eyes were always turned upon the sombre cliffs the blue gorges and
the snowclad turrets looking a sublime melancholy equal to their
own At times on the journey she sang thrilling te deums and
misereres that struck the true note of the hills and made their
route seem like a solemn march down a cathedral aisle The rescued
one spoke but seldom her mood partaking of the hush of nature that
surrounded them Armstrong looked upon her as an angel He could not
bring himself to the sacrilege of attempting to woo her as other
women may be wooed

On the third day they had descended as far as the _tierra templada_
the zona of the table lands and foot hills The mountains were
receding in their rear but still towered exhibiting yet impressively
their formidable heads Here they met signs of man They saw the
white houses of coffee plantations gleam across the clearings They
struck into a road where they met travellers and packmules Cattle
were grazing on the slopes They passed a little village where the
roundeyed _ninos_ shrieked and called at sight of them

Mlle Giraud laid aside her leopardskin robe It seemed to be a
trifle incongruous now In the mountains it had appeared fitting
and natural And if Armstrong was not mistaken she laid aside with
it something of the high dignity of her demeanour As the country
became more populous and significant of comfortable life he saw with
a feeling of joy that the exalted princess and priestess of the
Andean peaks was changing to a womanan earth woman but no less
enticing A little colour crept to the surface of her marble cheek
She arranged the conventional dress that the removal of the robe now
disclosed with the solicitous touch of one who is conscious of the
eyes of others She smoothed the careless sweep of her hair A
mundane interest long latent in the chilling atmosphere of the
ascetic peaks showed in her eyes

This thaw in his divinity sent Armstrongs heart going faster So
might an Arctic explorer thrill at his first ken of green fields and
liquescent waters They were on a lower plane of earth and life and
were succumbing to its peculiar subtle influence The austerity of
the hills no longer thinned the air they breathed About them was the
breath of fruit and corn and builded homes the comfortable smell of
smoke and warm earth and the consolations man has placed between
himself and the dust of his brother earth from which he sprung
While traversing those awful mountains Mile Giraud had seemed to
be wrapped in their spirit of reverent reserve Was this that same
womannow palpitating warm eager throbbing with conscious life and
charm feminine to her fingertips Pondering over this Armstrong
felt certain misgivings intrude upon his thoughts He wished he could
stop there with this changing creature descending no farther Here
was the elevation and environment to which her nature seemed to
respond with its best He feared to go down upon the mandominated
levels Would her spirit not yield still further in that artificial
zone to which they were descending

Now from a little plateau they saw the sea flash at the edge of the
green lowlands Mile Giraud gave a little catching sigh

Oh look Mr Armstrong there is the sea Isnt it lovely Im so
tired of mountains She heaved a pretty shoulder in a gesture of
repugnance Those horrid Indians Just think of what I suffered
Although I suppose I attained my ambition of becoming a stellar
attraction I wouldnt care to repeat the engagement It was very
nice of you to bring me away Tell me Mr Armstronghonestly now
do I look such an awful awful fright I havent looked into a
mirror you know for months

Armstrong made answer according to his changed moods Also he laid
his hand upon hers as it rested upon the horn of her saddle Luis was
at the head of the pack train and could not see She allowed it to
remain there and her eyes smiled frankly into his

Then at sundown they dropped upon the coast level under the palms and
lemons among the vivid greens and scarlets and ochres of the _tierra
caliente_ They rode into Macuto and saw the line of volatile bathers
frolicking in the surf The mountains were very far away

Mlle Girauds eyes were shining with a joy that could not have
existed under the chaperonage of the mountaintops There were other
spirits calling to hernymphs of the orange groves pixies from the
chattering surf imps born of the music the perfumes colours and
the insinuating presence of humanity She laughed aloud musically
at a sudden thought

Wont there be a sensation she called to Armstrong Dont I wish
I had an engagement just now though What a picnic the press agent
would have Held a prisoner by a band of savage Indians subdued by
the spell of her wonderful voicewouldnt that make great stuff
But I guess I quit the game winner anyhowthere ought to be a
couple of thousand dollars in that sack of gold dust I collected as
encores dont you think

He left her at the door of the little Hotel de Buen Descansar where
she had stopped before Two hours later he returned to the hotel He
glanced in at the open door of the little combined reception room and
cafe

Half a dozen of Macutos representative social and official
_caballeros_ were distributed about the room Senor Villablanca the
wealthy rubber concessionist reposed his fat figure on two chairs
with an emollient smile beaming upon his chocolatecoloured face
Guilbert the French mining engineer leered through his polished
noseglasses Colonel Mendez of the regular army in goldlaced
uniform and fatuous grin was busily extracting corks from champagne
bottles Other patterns of Macutian gallantry and fashion pranced and
posed The air was hazy with cigarette smoke Wine dripped upon the
floor

Perched upon a table in the centre of the room in an attitude of easy
preeminence was Mlle Giraud A chic costume of white lawn and cherry
ribbons supplanted her travelling garb There was a suggestion of
lace and a frill or two with a discreet small implication of
handembroidered pink hosiery Upon her lap rested a guitar In her
face was the light of resurrection the peace of elysium attained
through fire and suffering She was singing to a lively accompaniment
a little song

 When you see de big round moon
 Comin up like a balloon
 Dis nigger skips fur to kiss de lips
 Ob his stylish blackfaced coon

The singer caught sight of Armstrong

VI

GIRL


In gilt letters on the ground glass of the door of room No 962 were
the words Robbins  Hartley Brokers The clerks had gone It was
past five and with the solid tramp of a drove of prize Percherons
scrubwomen were invading the cloudcapped twentystory office
building A puff of redhot air flavoured with lemon peelings
softcoal smoke and train oil came in through the halfopen windows

Robbins fifty something of an overweight beau and addicted to first
nights and hotel palmrooms pretended to be envious of his partners
commuters joys

Going to be something doing in the humidity line tonight he said
You outoftown chaps will be the people with your katydids and
moonlight and long drinks and things out on the front porch

Hartley twentynine serious thin goodlooking nervous sighed
and frowned a little

Yes said he we always have cool nights in Floralhurst especially
in the winter

A man with an air of mystery came in the door and went up to Hartley

Ive found where she lives he announced in the portentous
halfwhisper that makes the detective at work a marked being to his
fellow men

Hartley scowled him into a state of dramatic silence and quietude
But by that time Robbins had got his cane and set his tie pin to his
liking and with a debonair nod went out to his metropolitan
amusements

Here is the address said the detective in a natural tone being
deprived of an audience to foil

Hartley took the leaf torn out of the sleuths dingy memorandum book
On it were pencilled the words Vivienne Arlington No 341 East
th Street care of Mrs McComus

Moved there a week ago said the detective Now if you want any
shadowing done Mr Hartley I can do you as fine a job in that line
as anybody in the city It will be only 7 a day and expenses Can
send in a daily typewritten report covering

You neednt go on interrupted the broker It isnt a case of that
kind I merely wanted the address How much shall I pay you

One days work said the sleuth A tenner will cover it

Hartley paid the man and dismissed him Then he left the office and
boarded a Broadway car At the first large crosstown artery of travel
he took an eastbound car that deposited him in a decaying avenue
whose ancient structures once sheltered the pride and glory of the
town

Walking a few squares he came to the building that he sought It was
a new flathouse bearing carved upon its cheap stone portal its
sonorous name The Vallambrosa Fireescapes zigzagged down its
frontthese laden with household goods drying clothes and
squalling children evicted by the midsummer heat Here and there a
pale rubber plant peeped from the miscellaneous mass as if wondering
to what kingdom it belongedvegetable animal or artificial

Hartley pressed the McComus button The door latch clicked
spasmodicallynow hospitably now doubtfully as though in
anxiety whether it might be admitting friends or duns Hartley
entered and began to climb the stairs after the manner of those who
seek their friends in city flathouseswhich is the manner of a boy
who climbs an appletree stopping when he comes upon what he wants

On the fourth floor he saw Vivienne standing in an open door She
invited him inside with a nod and a bright genuine smile She
placed a chair for him near a window and poised herself gracefully
upon the edge of one of those JekyllandHyde pieces of furniture that
are masked and mysteriously hooded unguessable bulks by day and
inquisitorial racks of torture by night

Hartley cast a quick critical appreciative glance at her before
speaking and told himself that his taste in choosing had been
flawless

Vivienne was about twentyone She was of the purest Saxon type Her
hair was a ruddy golden each filament of the neatly gathered mass
shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour In
perfect harmony were her ivoryclear complexion and deep seablue eyes
that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or
the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream Her frame was strong
and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness And yet with all
her Northern clearness and frankness of line and colouring there
seemed to be something of the tropics in hersomething of languor
in the droop of her pose of love of ease in her ingenious complacency
of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathingsomething
that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to
exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beautiful
milkwhite dove among its soberhued companions

She was dressed in a white waist and dark skirtthat discreet
masquerade of goosegirl and duchess

Vivienne said Hartley looking at her pleadingly you did not
answer my last letter It was only by nearly a weeks search that I
found where you had moved to Why have you kept me in suspense when
you knew how anxiously I was waiting to see you and hear from you

The girl looked out the window dreamily

Mr Hartley she said hesitatingly I hardly know what to say to
you I realize all the advantages of your offer and sometimes I feel
sure that I could be contented with you But again I am doubtful
I was born a city girl and I am afraid to bind myself to a quiet
suburban life

My dear girl said Hartley ardently have I not told you that you
shall have everything that your heart can desire that is in my power
to give you You shall come to the city for the theatres for
shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to You can
trust me can you not

To the fullest she said turning her frank eyes upon him with a
smile I know you are the kindest of men and that the girl you get
will be a lucky one I learned all about you when I was at the
Montgomerys

Ah exclaimed Hartley with a tender reminiscent light in his eye
I remember well the evening I first saw you at the Montgomerys
Mrs Montgomery was sounding your praises to me all the evening
And she hardly did you justice I shall never forget that supper
Come Vivienne promise me I want you Youll never regret coming
with me No one else will ever give you as pleasant a home

The girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands

A sudden jealous suspicion seized Hartley

Tell me Vivienne he asked regarding her keenly is there
anotheris there some one else

A rosy flush crept slowly over her fair cheeks and neck

You shouldnt ask that Mr Hartley she said in some confusion
But I will tell you There is one otherbut he has no rightI
have promised him nothing

His name demanded Hartley sternly

Townsend

Rafford Townsend exclaimed Hartley with a grim tightening of his
jaw How did that man come to know you After all Ive done for
him

His auto has just stopped below said Vivienne bending over the
windowsill Hes coming for his answer Oh I dont know what to
do

The bell in the flat kitchen whirred Vivienne hurried to press the
latch button

Stay here said Hartley I will meet him in the hall

Townsend looking like a Spanish grandee in his light tweeds Panama
hat and curling black mustache came up the stairs three at a time
He stopped at sight of Hartley and looked foolish

Go back said Hartley firmly pointing downstairs with his
forefinger

Hullo said Townsend feigning surprise Whats up What are you
doing here old man

Go back repeated Hartley inflexibly The Law of the Jungle Do
you want the Pack to tear you in pieces The kill is mine

I came here to see a plumber about the bathroom connections said
Townsend bravely

All right said Hartley You shall have that lying plaster to
stick upon your traitorous soul But go back Townsend went
downstairs leaving a bitter word to be wafted up the draught of the
staircase Hartley went back to his wooing

Vivienne said he masterfully I have got to have you I will
take no more refusals or dillydallying

When do you want me she asked

Now As soon as you can get ready

She stood calmly before him and looked him in the eye

Do you think for one moment she said that I would enter your home
while Heloise is there

Hartley cringed as if from an unexpected blow He folded his arms and
paced the carpet once or twice

She shall go he declared grimly Drops stood upon his brow Why
should I let that woman make my life miserable Never have I seen one
day of freedom from trouble since I have known her You are right
Vivienne Heloise must be sent away before I can take you home But
she shall go I have decided I will turn her from my doors

When will you do this asked the girl

Hartley clinched his teeth and bent his brows together

Tonight he said resolutely I will send her away tonight

Then said Vivienne my answer is yes Come for me when you
will

She looked into his eyes with a sweet sincere light in her own
Hartley could scarcely believe that her surrender was true it was
so swift and complete

Promise me he said feelingly on your word and honour

On my word and honour repeated Vivienne softly

At the door he turned and gazed at her happily but yet as one who
scarcely trusts the foundations of his joy

Tomorrow he said with a forefinger of reminder uplifted

Tomorrow she repeated with a smile of truth and candour

In an hour and forty minutes Hartley stepped off the train at
Floralhurst A brisk walk of ten minutes brought him to the gate of a
handsome twostory cottage set upon a wide and welltended lawn
Halfway to the house he was met by a woman with jetblack braided hair
and flowing white summer gown who half strangled him without apparent
cause

When they stepped into the hall she said

Mammas here The auto is coming for her in half an hour She came
to dinner but theres no dinner

Ive something to tell you said Hartley I thought to break it to
you gently but since your mother is here we may as well out with it

He stooped and whispered something at her ear

His wife screamed Her mother came running into the hall The
darkhaired woman screamed againthe joyful scream of a wellbeloved
and petted woman

Oh mamma she cried ecstatically what do you think Vivienne is
coming to cook for us She is the one that stayed with the
Montgomerys a whole year And now Billy dear she concluded you
must go right down into the kitchen and discharge Heloise She has
been drunk again the whole day long




VII

SOCIOLOGY IN SERGE AND STRAW


The season of irresponsibility is at hand Come let us twine round
our brows wreaths of poison ivy that is for idiocy and wander hand
in hand with sociology in the summer fields

Likely as not the world is flat The wise men have tried to prove
that it is round with indifferent success They pointed out to us a
ship going to sea and bade us observe that at length the convexity
of the earth hid from our view all but the vessels topmast But we
picked up a telescope and looked and saw the decks and hull again
Then the wise men said Oh pshaw anyhow the variation of the
intersection of the equator and the ecliptic proves it We could not
see this through our telescope so we remained silent But it stands
to reason that if the world were round the queues of Chinamen
would stand straight up from their heads instead of hanging down their
backs as travellers assure us they do

Another hotweather corroboration of the flat theory is the fact that
all of life as we know it moves in little unavailing circles
More justly than to anything else it can be likened to the game
of baseball Crack we hit the ball and away we go If we earn a
run in life we call it success we get back to the home plate and
sit upon a bench If we are thrown out we walk back to the home
plateand sit upon a bench

The circumnavigators of the alleged globe may have sailed the rim of a
watery circle back to the same port again The truly great return at
the high tide of their attainments to the simplicity of a child The
billionaire sits down at his mahogany to his bowl of bread and milk
When you reach the end of your career just take down the sign Goal
and look at the other side of it You will find Beginning Point
there It has been reversed while you were going around the track

But this is humour and must be stopped Let us get back to the
serious questions that arise whenever Sociology turns summer boarder
You are invited to consider the scene of the storywild Atlantic
waves thundering against a wooded and rockbound shorein the
Greater City of New York

The town of Fishampton on the south shore of Long Island is noted
for its clam fritters and the summer residence of the Van Plushvelts

The Van Plushvelts have a hundred million dollars and their name is a
household word with tradesmen and photographers

On the fifteenth of June the Van Plushvelts boarded up the front door
of their city house carefully deposited their cat on the sidewalk
instructed the caretaker not to allow it to eat any of the ivy on the
walls and whizzed away in a 40horsepower to Fishampton to stray
alone in the shadeAmaryllis not being in their class If you are a
subscriber to the _Toadies Magazine_ you have oftenYou say you are
not Well you buy it at a newsstand thinking that the newsdealer
is not wise to you But he knows about it all HE knowsHE knows
I say that you have often seen in the _Toadies Magazine_ pictures of
the Van Plushvelts summer home so it will not be described here
Our business is with young Haywood Van Plushvelt sixteen years old
heir to the century of millions darling of the financial gods and
great grandson of Peter Van Plushvelt former owner of a particularly
fine cabbage patch that has been ruined by an intrusive lot of
downtown skyscrapers

One afternoon young Haywood Van Plushvelt strolled out between the
granite gate posts of Dolce far Nientethats what they called
the place and it was an improvement on dolce Far Rockaway I can
tell you

Haywood walked down into the village He was human after all and
his prospective millions weighed upon him Wealth had wreaked upon
him its direfullest He was the product of private tutors Even under
his first hobbyhorse had tan bark been strewn He had been born with
a gold spoon lobster fork and fishset in his mouth For which I
hope later to submit justification I must ask your consideration of
his haberdashery and tailoring

Young Fortunatus was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a
neat white straw hat neat lowcut tan shoes of the wellknown
immaculate trade mark a neat narrow fourinhand tie and carried
a slender neat bamboo cane

Down Persimmon Street theres never tree north of Hagerstown Md
came from the village Smoky Dodson fifteen and a half worst boy in
Fishampton Smoky was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and
weatherworn golf cap runover shoes and trousers of the
serviceable brand Dust clinging to the moisture induced by free
exercise darkened wide areas of his face Smoky carried a baseball
bat and a league ball that advertised itself in the rotundity of his
trousers pocket Haywood stopped and passed the time of day

Going to play ball he asked

Smokys eyes and countenance confronted him with a frank
blueandfreckled scrutiny

Me he said with deadly mildness sure not Cant you see Ive
got a divin suit on Im goin up in a submarine balloon to catch
butterflies with a twoinch auger

Excuse me said Haywood with the insulting politeness of his
caste for mistaking you for a gentleman I might have known
better

How might you have known better if you thought I was one said
Smoky unconsciously a logician

By your appearance said Haywood No gentleman is dirty ragged
and a liar

Smoky hooted once like a ferryboat spat on his hand got a firm
grip on his baseball bat and then dropped it against the fence

Say said he I knows you Youre the pup that belongs in that
swell private summer sanitarium for cityguys over there I seen you
come out of the gate You cant bluff nobody because youre rich
And because you got on swell clothes Arabella Yah

Ragamuffin said Haywood

Smoky picked up a fencerail splinter and laid it on his shoulder

Dare you to knock it off he challenged

I wouldnt soil my hands with you said the aristocrat

Fraid said Smoky concisely Youse cityducks aint got the I
sand I kin lick you with onehand

I dont wish to have any trouble with you said Haywood I asked
you a civil question and you replied like alike aa cad

Wots a cad asked Smoky

A cad is a disagreeable person answered Haywood who lacks manners
and doesnt know his place They sometimes play baseball

I can tell you what a mollycoddle is said Smoky Its a monkey
dressed up by its mother and sent out to pick daisies on the lawn

When you have the honour to refer to the members of my family said
Haywood with some dim ideas of a code in his mind youd better
leave the ladies out of your remarks

Ho ladies mocked the rude one I say ladies I know what them
rich women in the city does They drink cocktails and swear and give
parties to gorillas The papers say so

Then Haywood knew that it must be He took off his coat folded it
neatly and laid it on the roadside grass placed his hat upon it and
began to unknot his blue silk tie

Hadnt yer better ring fer yer maid Arabella taunted Smoky
Wot yer going to dogo to bed

Im going to give you a good trouncing said the hero He did not
hesitate although the enemy was far beneath him socially He
remembered that his father once thrashed a cabman and the papers gave
it two columns first page And the _Toadies Magazine_ had a special
article on Upper Cuts by the Upper Classes and ran new pictures of
the Van Plushvelt country seat at Fishampton

Wots trouncing asked Smoky suspiciously I dont want your
old clothes Im nooh you mean to scrap My my I wont do a
thing to mammas pet Criminy Id hate to be a handlaundered thing
like you

Smoky waited with some awkwardness for his adversary to prepare for
battle His own decks were always clear for action When he should
spit upon the palm of his terrible right it was equivalent to You may
fire now Gridley

The hated patrician advanced with his shirt sleeves neatly rolled up
Smoky waited in an attitude of ease expecting the affair to be
conducted according to Fishamptons rules of war These allowed
combat to be prefaced by stigma recrimination epithet abuse and
insult gradually increasing in emphasis and degree After a round of
these youre anothers would come the chip knocked from the shoulder
or the advance across the dare line drawn with a toe on the ground
Next light taps given and taken these also increasing in force until
finally the blood was up and fists going at their best

But Haywood did not know Fishamptons rules Noblesse oblige kept a
faint smile on his face as he walked slowly up to Smoky and said

Going to play ball

Smoky quickly understood this to be a putting of the previous
question giving him the chance to make practical apology by answering
it with civility and relevance

Listen this time said he Im goin skatin on the river Dont
you see me automobile with Chinese lanterns on it standin and waitin
for me

Haywood knocked him down

Smoky felt wronged To thus deprive him of preliminary wrangle and
objurgation was to send an armoured knight full tilt against a
crashing lance without permitting him first to caracole around the
list to the flourish of trumpets But he scrambled up and fell upon
his foe head feet and fists

The fight lasted one round of an hour and ten minutes It was
lengthened until it was more like a war or a family feud than a fight
Haywood had learned some of the science of boxing and wrestling from
his tutors but these he discarded for the more instinctive methods of
battle handed down by the cavedwelling Van Plushvelts

So when he found himself during the melee seated upon the kicking
and roaring Smokys chest he improved the opportunity by vigorously
kneading handfuls of sand and soil into his adversarys ears eyes
and mouth and when Smoky got the proper leg hold and turned him
he fastened both hands in the Plushvelt hair and pounded the Plushvelt
head against the lap of mother earth Of course the strife was not
incessantly active There were seasons when one sat upon the other
holding him down while each blew like a grampus spat out the more
inconveniently large sections of gravel and earth and strove to subdue
the spirit of his opponent with a frightful and soulparalyzing glare

At last it seemed that in the language of the ring their efforts
lacked steam They broke away and each disappeared in a cloud as he
brushed away the dust of the conflict As soon as his breath
permitted Haywood walked close to Smoky and said

Going to play ball

Smoky looked pensively at the sky at his bat lying on the ground
and at the leaguer rounding his pocket

Sure he said offhandedly The Yellowjackets plays the Long
Islands Im capn of the Long Islands

I guess I didnt mean to say you were ragged said Haywood But
you are dirty you know

Sure said Smoky Yer get that way knockin around Say I
dont believe them New York papers about ladies drinkin and havin
monkeys dinin at the table with em I guess theyre lies like they
print about people eatin out of silver plates and ownin dogs that
cost 100

Certainly said Haywood What do you play on your team

Ketcher Ever play any

Never in my life said Haywood Ive never known any fellows
except one or two of my cousins

Jer like to learn Were goin to have a practicegame before the
match Wanter come along Ill put yer in leftfield and yer wont
be long ketchin on

Id like it bully said Haywood Ive always wanted to play
baseball

The ladies maids of New York and the families of Western mine owners
with social ambitions will remember well the sensation that was
created by the report that the young multimillionaire Haywood Van
Plushvelt was playing ball with the village youths of Fishampton It
was conceded that the millennium of democracy had come Reporters and
photographers swarmed to the island The papers printed halfpage
pictures of him as shortstop stopping a hot grounder The _Toadies
Magazine_ got out a Bat and Ball number that covered the subject
historically beginning with the vampire bat and ending with the
Patriarchs ballillustrated with interior views of the Van
Plushvelt country seat Ministers educators and sociologists
everywhere hailed the event as the tocsin call that proclaimed the
universal brotherhood of man

One afternoon I was reclining under the trees near the shore at
Fishampton in the esteemed company of an eminent baldheaded young
sociologist By way of note it may be inserted that all sociologists
are more or less bald and exactly thirtytwo Look em over

The sociologist was citing the Van Plushvelt case as the most
important uplift symptom of a generation and as an excuse for his
own existence

Immediately before us were the village baseball grounds And now came
the sportive youth of Fishampton and distributed themselves shouting
about the diamond

There said the sociologist pointing there is young Van
Plushvelt

I raised myself so far a cosycophant with Mary Ann and gazed

Young Van Plushvelt sat upon the ground He was dressed in a ragged
red sweater wrecked and weatherworn golf cap runover shoes and
trousers of the serviceable brand Dust clinging to the moisture
induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face

That is he repeated the sociologist If he had said him I could
have been less vindictive

On a bench with an air sat the young millionaires chum

He was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw
hat neat lowcut tan shoes linen of the wellknown immaculate
trade mark a neat narrow fourinhand tie and carried a slender
neat bamboo cane

I laughed loudly and vulgarly

What you want to do said I to the sociologist is to establish a
reformatory for the Logical Vicious Circle Or else Ive got wheels
It looks to me as if things are running round and round in circles
instead of getting anywhere

What do you mean asked the man of progress

Why look what he has done to Smoky I replied

You will always be a fool said my friend the sociologist
getting up and walking away




VIII

THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF


It looked like a good thing but wait till I tell you We were down
South in AlabamaBill Driscoll and myselfwhen this kidnapping
idea struck us It was as Bill afterward expressed it during a
moment of temporary mental apparition but we didnt find that out
till later

There was a town down there as flat as a flannelcake and called
Summit of course It contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and
selfsatisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a
Maypole

Bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars and
we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent
townlot scheme in Western Illinois with We talked it over on the
front steps of the hotel Philoprogenitiveness says we is strong
in semirural communities therefore and for other reasons a
kidnapping project ought to do better there than in the radius of
newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir up talk
about such things We knew that Summit couldnt get after us with
anything stronger than constables and maybe some lackadaisical
bloodhounds and a diatribe or two in the _Weekly Farmers Budget_
So it looked good

We selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named
Ebenezer Dorset The father was respectable and tight a mortgage
fancier and a stern upright collectionplate passer and forecloser
The kid was a boy of ten with basrelief freckles and hair the
colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the newsstand when you
want to catch a train Bill and me figured that Ebenezer would melt
down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent But wait till I
tell you

About two miles from Summit was a little mountain covered with a
dense cedar brake On the rear elevation of this mountain was a cave
There we stored provisions One evening after sundown we drove in a
buggy past old Dorsets house The kid was in the street throwing
rocks at a kitten on the opposite fence

Hey little boy says Bill would you like to have a bag of candy
and a nice ride

The boy catches Bill neatly in the eye with a piece of brick

That will cost the old man an extra five hundred dollars says Bill
climbing over the wheel

That boy put up a fight like a welterweight cinnamon bear but at
last we got him down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away We
took him up to the cave and I hitched the horse in the cedar brake
After dark I drove the buggy to the little village three miles away
where we had hired it and walked back to the mountain

Bill was pasting courtplaster over the scratches and bruises on his
features There was a fire burning behind the big rock at the entrance
of the cave and the boy was watching a pot of boiling coffee with
two buzzard tailfeathers stuck in his red hair He points a stick
at me when I come up and says

Ha cursed paleface do you dare to enter the camp of Red Chief the
terror of the plains

Hes all right now says Bill rolling up his trousers and examining
some bruises on his shins Were playing Indian Were making
Buffalo Bills show look like magiclantern views of Palestine in the
town hall Im Old Hank the Trapper Red Chiefs captive and Im to
be scalped at daybreak By Geronimo that kid can kick hard

Yes sir that boy seemed to be having the time of his life The fun
of camping out in a cave had made him forget that he was a captive
himself He immediately christened me Snakeeye the Spy and
announced that when his braves returned from the warpath I was to be
broiled at the stake at the rising of the sun

Then we had supper and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread
and gravy and began to talk He made a duringdinner speech
something like this

I like this fine I never camped out before but I had a pet possum
once and I was nine last birthday I hate to go to school Rats ate
up sixteen of Jimmy Talbots aunts speckled hens eggs Are there
any real Indians in these woods I want some more gravy Does the
trees moving make the wind blow We had five puppies What makes your
nose so red Hank My father has lots of money Are the stars hot I
whipped Ed Walker twice Saturday I dont like girls You dassent
catch toads unless with a string Do oxen make any noise Why are
oranges round Have you got beds to sleep on in this cave Amos Murray
has got six toes A parrot can talk but a monkey or a fish cant
How many does it take to make twelve

Every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky redskin and
pick up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber
for the scouts of the hated paleface Now and then he would let out a
warwhoop that made Old Hank the Trapper shiver That boy had Bill
terrorized from the start

Red Chief says I to the kid would you like to go home

Aw what for says he I dont have any fun at home I hate to
go to school I like to camp out You wont take me back home again
Snakeeye will you

Not right away says I Well stay here in the cave a while

All right says he Thatll be fine I never had such fun in all
my life

We went to bed about eleven oclock We spread down some wide
blankets and quilts and put Red Chief between us We werent afraid
hed run away He kept us awake for three hours jumping up and
reaching for his rifle and screeching Hist pard in mine and
Bills ears as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf
revealed to his young imagination the stealthy approach of the outlaw
band At last I fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed that I had
been kidnapped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red
hair

Just at daybreak I was awakened by a series of awful screams from
Bill They werent yells or howls or shouts or whoops or yawps
such as youd expect from a manly set of vocal organsthey were
simply indecent terrifying humiliating screams such as women emit
when they see ghosts or caterpillars Its an awful thing to hear a
strong desperate fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak

I jumped up to see what the matter was Red Chief was sitting on
Bills chest with one hand twined in Bills hair In the other he
had the sharp caseknife we used for slicing bacon and he was
industriously and realistically trying to take Bills scalp according
to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before

I got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again But
from that moment Bills spirit was broken He laid down on his side
of the bed but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that
boy was with us I dozed off for a while but along toward sunup I
remembered that Red Chief had said I was to be burned at the stake
at the rising of the sun I wasnt nervous or afraid but I sat up
and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock

What you getting up so soon for Sam asked Bill

Me says I Oh I got a kind of a pain in my shoulder I thought
sitting up would rest it

Youre a liar says Bill Youre afraid You was to be burned at
sunrise and you was afraid hed do it And he would too if he
could find a match Aint it awful Sam Do you think anybody will pay
out money to get a little imp like that back home

Sure said I A rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents
dote on Now you and the Chief get up and cook breakfast while I go
up on the top of this mountain and reconnoitre

I went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the
contiguous vicinity Over toward Summit I expected to see the sturdy
yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the
countryside for the dastardly kidnappers But what I saw was a
peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule
Nobody was dragging the creek no couriers dashed hither and yon
bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents There was a
sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the
external outward surface of Alabama that lay exposed to my view
Perhaps says I to myself it has not yet been discovered that
the wolves have borne away the tender lambkin from the fold Heaven
help the wolves says I and I went down the mountain to breakfast

When I got to the cave I found Bill backed up against the side of it
breathing hard and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half
as big as a cocoanut

He put a redhot boiled potato down my back explained Bill and
then mashed it with his foot and I boxed his ears Have you got a gun
about you Sam

I took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument
Ill fix you says the kid to Bill No man ever yet struck the Red
Chief but what he got paid for it You better beware

After breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped
around it out of his pocket and goes outside the cave unwinding it

Whats he up to now says Bill anxiously You dont think hell
run away do you Sam

No fear of it says I He dont seem to be much of a home body
But weve got to fix up some plan about the ransom There dont seem
to be much excitement around Summit on account of his disappearance
but maybe they havent realized yet that hes gone His folks may
think hes spending the night with Aunt Jane or one of the neighbours
Anyhow hell be missed today Tonight we must get a message to his
father demanding the two thousand dollars for his return

Just then we heard a kind Of warwhoop such as David might have
emitted when he knocked out the champion Goliath It was a sling that
Red Chief had pulled out of his pocket and he was whirling it around
his head

I dodged and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from Bill like
a horse gives out when you take his saddle off A niggerhead rock the
size of an egg had caught Bill just behind his left ear He loosened
himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot
water for washing the dishes I dragged him out and poured cold water
on his head for half an hour

By and by Bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says Sam do
you know who my favourite Biblical character is

Take it easy says I Youll come to your senses presently

King Herod says he You wont go away and leave me here alone
will you Sam

I went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles
rattled

If you dont behave says I Ill take you straight home Now are
you going to be good or not

I was only funning says he sullenly I didnt mean to hurt Old
Hank But what did he hit me for Ill behave Snakeeye if you
wont send me home and if youll let me play the Black Scout today

I dont know the game says I Thats for you and Mr Bill to
decide Hes your playmate for the day Im going away for a while
on business Now you come in and make friends with him and say you
are sorry for hurting him or home you go at once

I made him and Bill shake hands and then I took Bill aside and told
him I was going to Poplar Cove a little village three miles from the
cave and find out what I could about how the kidnapping had been
regarded in Summit Also I thought it best to send a peremptory
letter to old man Dorset that day demanding the ransom and dictating
how it should be paid

You know Sam says Bill Ive stood by you without batting an
eye in earthquakes fire and floodin poker games dynamite
outrages police raids train robberies and cyclones I never lost my
nerve yet till we kidnapped that twolegged skyrocket of a kid Hes
got me going You wont leave me long with him will you Sam

Ill be back some time this afternoon says I You must keep the
boy amused and quiet till I return And now well write the letter to
old Dorset

Bill and I got paper and pencil and worked on the letter while Red
Chief with a blanket wrapped around him strutted up and down
guarding the mouth of the cave Bill begged me tearfully to make the
ransom fifteen hundred dollars instead of two thousand I aint
attempting says he to decry the celebrated moral aspect of
parental affection but were dealing with humans and it aint human
for anybody to give up two thousand dollars for that fortypound chunk
of freckled wildcat Im willing to take a chance at fifteen hundred
dollars You can charge the difference up to me

So to relieve Bill I acceded and we collaborated a letter that ran
this way

 _Ebenezer Dorset Esq_

 We have your boy concealed in a place far from Summit It is useless
 for you or the most skilful detectives to attempt to find him
 Absolutely the only terms on which you can have him restored to you
 are these We demand fifteen hundred dollars in large bills for his
 return the money to be left at midnight tonight at the same spot
 and in the same box as your replyas hereinafter described If
 you agree to these terms send your answer in writing by a solitary
 messenger tonight at halfpast eight oclock After crossing Owl
 Creek on the road to Poplar Cove there are three large trees about
 a hundred yards apart close to the fence of the wheat field on the
 righthand side At the bottom of the fencepost opposite the
 third tree will be found a small pasteboard box

 The messenger will place the answer in this box and return
 immediately to Summit

 If you attempt any treachery or fail to comply with our demand as
 stated you will never see your boy again

 If you pay the money as demanded he will be returned to you safe
 and well within three hours These terms are final and if you do
 not accede to them no further communication will be attempted

 TWO DESPERATE MEN

I addressed this letter to Dorset and put it in my pocket As I was
about to start the kid comes up to me and says

Aw Snakeeye you said I could play the Black Scout while you was
gone

Play it of course says I Mr Bill will play with you What
kind of a game is it

Im the Black Scout says Red Chief and I have to ride to the
stockade to warn the settlers that the Indians are coming Im tired
of playing Indian myself I want to be the Black Scout

All right says I It sounds harmless to me I guess Mr Bill will
help you foil the pesky savages

What am I to do asks Bill looking at the kid suspiciously

You are the hoss says Black Scout Get down on your hands and
knees How can I ride to the stockade without a hoss

Youd better keep him interested said I till we get the scheme
going Loosen up

Bill gets down on his all fours and a look comes in his eye like a
rabbits when you catch it in a trap

How far is it to the stockade kid he asks in a husky manner of
voice

Ninety miles says the Black Scout And you have to hump yourself
to get there on time Whoa now

The Black Scout jumps on Bills back and digs his heels in his side

For Heavens sake says Bill hurry back Sam as soon as you can
I wish we hadnt made the ransom more than a thousand Say you quit
kicking me or Ill get up and warm you good

I walked over to Poplar Cove and sat around the postoffice and
store talking with the chawbacons that came in to trade One
whiskerando says that he hears Summit is all upset on account of Elder
Ebenezer Dorsets boy having been lost or stolen That was all I
wanted to know I bought some smoking tobacco referred casually to
the price of blackeyed peas posted my letter surreptitiously and
came away The postmaster said the mailcarrier would come by in an
hour to take the mail on to Summit

When I got back to the cave Bill and the boy were not to be found I
explored the vicinity of the cave and risked a yodel or two but
there was no response

So I lighted my pipe and sat down on a mossy bank to await
developments

In about half an hour I heard the bushes rustle and Bill wabbled out
into the little glade in front of the cave Behind him was the kid
stepping softly like a scout with a broad grin on his face Bill
stopped took off his hat and wiped his face with a red handkerchief
The kid stopped about eight feet behind him

Sam says Bill I suppose youll think Im a renegade but I
couldnt help it Im a grown person with masculine proclivities and
habits of selfdefense but there is a time when all systems of
egotism and predominance fail The boy is gone I have sent him
home All is off There was martyrs in old times goes on Bill
that suffered death rather than give up the particular graft they
enjoyed None of em ever was subjugated to such supernatural
tortures as I have been I tried to be faithful to our articles of
depredation but there came a limit

Whats the trouble Bill I asks him

I was rode says Bill the ninety miles to the stockade not
barring an inch Then when the settlers was rescued I was given
oats Sand aint a palatable substitute And then for an hour I
had to try to explain to him why there was nothin in holes how
a road can run both ways and what makes the grass green I tell
you Sam a human can only stand so much I takes him by the neck
of his clothes and drags him down the mountain On the way he
kicks my legs blackandblue from the knees down and Ive got to
have two or three bites on my thumb and hand cauterized

But hes gonecontinues Billgone home I showed him the
road to Summit and kicked him about eight feet nearer there at one
kick Im sorry we lose the ransom but it was either that or Bill
Driscoll to the madhouse

Bill is puffing and blowing but there is a look of ineffable peace
and growing content on his rosepink features

Bill says I there isnt any heart disease in your family is
there

No says Bill nothing chronic except malaria and accidents Why

Then you might turn around says I and have a took behind you

Bill turns and sees the boy and loses his complexion and sits down
plump on the round and begins to pluck aimlessly at grass and little
sticks For an hour I was afraid for his mind And then I told him
that my scheme was to put the whole job through immediately and that
we would get the ransom and be off with it by midnight if old Dorset
fell in with our proposition So Bill braced up enough to give the
kid a weak sort of a smile and a promise to play the Russian in a
Japanese war with him is soon as he felt a little better

I had a scheme for collecting that ransom without danger of being
caught by counterplots that ought to commend itself to professional
kidnappers The tree under which the answer was to be leftand the
money later onwas close to the road fence with big bare fields on
all sides If a gang of constables should be watching for any one to
come for the note they could see him a long way off crossing the
fields or in the road But no sirree At halfpast eight I was up in
that tree as well hidden as a tree toad waiting for the messenger to
arrive

Exactly on time a halfgrown boy rides up the road on a bicycle
locates the pasteboard box at the foot of the fencepost slips a
folded piece of paper into it and pedals away again back toward
Summit

I waited an hour and then concluded the thing was square I slid down
the tree got the note slipped along the fence till I struck the
woods and was back at the cave in another half an hour I opened the
note got near the lantern and read it to Bill It was written with a
pen in a crabbed hand and the sum and substance of it was this

 _Two Desperate Men

 Gentlemen_ I received your letter today by post in regard to the
 ransom you ask for the return of my son I think you are a little
 high in your demands and I hereby make you a counterproposition
 which I am inclined to believe you will accept You bring Johnny
 home and pay me two hundred and fifty dollars in cash and I agree
 to take him off your hands You had better come at night for the
 neighbours believe he is lost and I couldnt be responsible for
 what they would do to anybody they saw bringing him back Very
 respectfully

 EBENEZER DORSET

Great pirates of Penzance says I of all the impudent

But I glanced at Bill and hesitated He had the most appealing look
in his eyes I ever saw on the face of a dumb or a talking brute

Sam says he whats two hundred and fifty dollars after all
Weve got the money One more night of this kid will send me to a bed
in Bedlam Besides being a thorough gentleman I think Mr Dorset is
a spendthrift for making us such a liberal offer You aint going
to let the chance go are you

Tell you the truth Bill says I this little he ewe lamb has
somewhat got on my nerves too Well take him home pay the ransom
and make our getaway

We took him home that night We got him to go by telling him that his
father had bought a silvermounted rifle and a pair of moccasins for
him and we were going to hunt bears the next day

It was just twelve oclock when we knocked at Ebenezers front door
Just at the moment when I should have been abstracting the fifteen
hundred dollars from the box under the tree according to the original
proposition Bill was counting out two hundred and fifty dollars into
Dorsets hand

When the kid found out we were going to leave him at home he started
up a howl like a calliope and fastened himself as tight as a leech to
Bills leg His father peeled him away gradually like a porous
plaster

How long can you hold him asks Bill

Im not as strong as I used to be says old Dorset but I think I
can promise you ten minutes

Enough says Bill In ten minutes I shall cross the Central
Southern and Middle Western States and be legging it trippingly for
the Canadian border

And as dark as it was and as fat as Bill was and as good a runner
as I am he was a good mile and a half out of Summit before I could
catch up with him




IX

THE MARRY MONTH OF MAY


Prithee smite the poet in the eye when he would sing to you praises
of the month of May It is a month presided over by the spirits of
mischief and madness Pixies and flibbertigibbets haunt the budding
woods Puck and his train of midgets are busy in town and country

In May nature holds up at us a chiding finger bidding us remember
that we are not gods but overconceited members of her own great
family She reminds us that we are brothers to the chowderdoomed
clam and the donkey lineal scions of the pansy and the chimpanzee
and but cousinsgerman to the cooing doves the quacking ducks and the
housemaids and policemen in the parks

In May Cupid shoots blindfoldedmillionaires marry stenographers
wise professors woo whiteaproned gumchewers behind quicklunch
counters schoolmaams make big bad boys remain after school lads
with ladders steal lightly over lawns where Juliet waits in her
trellissed window with her telescope packed young couples out for a
walk come home married old chaps put on white spats and promenade
near the Normal School even married men grown unwontedly tender and
sentimental whack their spouses on the back and growl How goes it
old girl

This May who is no goddess but Circe masquerading at the dance
given in honour of the fair debutante Summer puts the kibosh on us
all

Old Mr Coulson groaned a little and then sat up straight in his
invalids chair He had the gout very bad in one foot a house near
Gramercy Park half a million dollars and a daughter And he had a
housekeeper Mrs Widdup The fact and the name deserve a sentence
each They have it

When May poked Mr Coulson he became elder brother to the turtledove
In the window near which he sat were boxes of jonquils of hyacinths
geraniums and pansies The breeze brought their odour into the room
Immediately there was a wellcontested round between the breath of the
flowers and the able and active effluvium from gout liniment The
liniment won easily but not before the flowers got an uppercut to
old Mr Coulsons nose The deadly work of the implacable false
enchantress May was done

Across the park to the olfactories of Mr Coulson came other
unmistakable characteristic copyrighted smells of spring that belong
to thebigcityabovetheSubway alone The smells of hot asphalt
underground caverns gasoline patchouli orange peel sewer gas
Albany grabs Egyptian cigarettes mortar and the undried ink on
newspapers The inblowing air was sweet and mild Sparrows wrangled
happily everywhere outdoors Never trust May

Mr Coulson twisted the ends of his white mustache cursed his foot
and pounded a bell on the table by his side

In came Mrs Widdup She was comely to the eye fair flustered
forty and foxy

Higgins is out sir she said with a smile suggestive of vibratory
massage He went to post a letter Can I do anything for you sir

Its time for my aconite said old Mr Coulson Drop it for me
The bottles there Three drops In water D that is confound
Higgins Theres nobody in this house cares if I die here in this
chair for want of attention

Mrs Widdup sighed deeply

Dont be saying that sir she said Theres them that would care
more than any one knows Thirteen drops you said sir

Three said old man Coulson

He took his dose and then Mrs Widdups hand She blushed Oh yes
it can be done Just hold your breath and compress the diaphragm

Mrs Widdup said Mr Coulson the springtimes full upon us

Aint that right said Mrs Widdup The airs real warm And
theres bockbeer signs on every corner And the parks all yaller and
pink and blue with flowers and I have such shooting pains up my legs
and body

In the spring quoted Mr Coulson curling his mustache a y
that is a mansfancy lightly turns to thoughts of love

Lawsy now exclaimed Mrs Widdup aint that right Seems like
its in the air

In the spring continued old Mr Coulson a livelier iris shines
upon the burnished dove

They do be lively the Irish sighed Mrs Widdup pensively

Mrs Widdup said Mr Coulson making a face at a twinge of his gouty
foot this would be a lonesome house without you Im anthat is
Im an elderly manbut Im worth a comfortable lot of money If half
a million dollars worth of Government bonds and the true affection of
a heart that though no longer beating with the first ardour of youth
can still throb with genuine

The loud noise of an overturned chair near the portieres of the
adjoining room interrupted the venerable and scarcely suspecting
victim of May

In stalked Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson bony durable tall
highnosed frigid wellbred thirtyfive intheneighbourhoodof
GramercyParkish She put up a lorgnette Mrs Widdup hastily
stooped and arranged the bandages on Mr Coulsons gouty foot

I thought Higgins was with you said Miss Van Meeker Constantia

Higgins went out explained her father and Mrs Widdup answered
the bell That is better now Mrs Widdup thank you No there is
nothing else I require

The housekeeper retired pink under the cool inquiring stare of Miss
Coulson

This spring weather is lovely isnt it daughter said the old man
consciously conscious

Thats just it replied Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson somewhat
obscurely When does Mrs Widdup start on her vacation papa

I believe she said a week from today said Mr Coulson

Miss Van Meeker Constantia stood for a minute at the window gazing
toward the little park flooded with the mellow afternoon sunlight
With the eye of a botanist she viewed the flowersmost potent
weapons of insidious May With the cool pulses of a virgin of
Cologne she withstood the attack of the ethereal mildness The arrows
of the pleasant sunshine fell back frostbitten from the cold panoply
of her unthrilled bosom The odour of the flowers waked no soft
sentiments in the unexplored recesses of her dormant heart The chirp
of the sparrows gave her a pain She mocked at May

But although Miss Coulson was proof against the season she was
keen enough to estimate its power She knew that elderly men and
thickwaisted women jumped as educated fleas in the ridiculous train
of May the merry mocker of the months She had heard of foolish old
gentlemen marrying their housekeepers before What a humiliating
thing after all was this feeling called love

The next morning at 8 oclock when the iceman called the cook told
him that Miss Coulson wanted to see him in the basement

Well aint I the Olcott and Depew not mentioning the first name at
all said the iceman admiringly of himself

As a concession he rolled his sleeves down dropped his icehooks on a
syringa and went back When Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson
addressed him he took off his hat

There is a rear entrance to this basement said Miss Coulson which
can be reached by driving into the vacant lot next door where they
are excavating for a building I want you to bring in that way within
two hours 1000 pounds of ice You may have to bring another man or
two to help you I will show you where I want it placed I also want
1000 pounds a day delivered the same way for the next four days
Your company may charge the ice on our regular bill This is for your
extra trouble

Miss Coulson tendered a tendollar bill The iceman bowed and held
his hat in his two hands behind him

Not if youll excuse me lady Itll be a pleasure to fix things up
for you any way you please

Alas for May

About noon Mr Coulson knocked two glasses off his table broke the
spring of his bell and yelled for Higgins at the same time

Bring an axe commanded Mr Coulson sardonically or send out
for a quart of prussic acid or have a policeman come in and shoot me
Id rather that than be frozen to death

It does seem to be getting cool Sir said Higgins I hadnt
noticed it before Ill close the window Sir

Do said Mr Coulson They call this spring do they If it keeps
up long Ill go back to Palm Beach House feels like a morgue

Later Miss Coulson dutifully came in to inquire how the gout was
progressing

Stantia said the old man how is the weather outdoors

Bright answered Miss Coulson but chilly

Feels like the dead of winter to me said Mr Coulson

An instance said Constantia gazing abstractedly out the window
of winter lingering in the lap of spring though the metaphor is
not in the most refined taste

A little later she walked down by the side of the little park and on
westward to Broadway to accomplish a little shopping

A little later than that Mrs Widdup entered the invalids room

Did you ring Sir she asked dimpling in many places I asked
Higgins to go to the drug store and I thought I heard your bell

I did not said Mr Coulson

Im afraid said Mrs Widdup I interrupted you sir yesterday when
you were about to say something

How comes it Mrs Widdup said old man Coulson sternly that I
find it so cold in this house

Cold Sir said the housekeeper why now since you speak of it
it do seem cold in this room But outdoors its as warm and fine
as June sir And how this weather do seem to make ones heart jump
out of ones shirt waist sir And the ivy all leaved out on the side
of the house and the handorgans playing and the children dancing on
the sidewalktis a great time for speaking out whats in the
heart You were saying yesterday sir

Woman roared Mr Coulson you are a fool I pay you to take care
of this house I am freezing to death in my own room and you come in
and drivel to me about ivy and handorgans Get me an overcoat at
once See that all doors and windows are closed below An old fat
irresponsible onesided object like you prating about springtime
and flowers in the middle of winter When Higgins comes back tell him
to bring me a hot rum punch And now get out

But who shall shame the bright face of May Rogue though she be and
disturber of sane mens peace no wise virgins cunning nor cold
storage shall make her bow her head in the bright galaxy of months

Oh yes the story was not quite finished

A night passed and Higgins helped old man Coulson in the morning to
his chair by the window The cold of the room was gone Heavenly
odours and fragrant mildness entered

In hurried Mrs Widdup and stood by his chair Mr Coulson reached
his bony hand and grasped her plump one

Mrs Widdup he said this house would be no home without you I
have half a million dollars If that and the true affection of a
heart no longer in its youthful prime but still not cold could

I found out what made it cold said Mrs Widdup leanin against his
chair Twas icetons of itin the basement and in the furnace
room everywhere I shut off the registers that it was coming through
into your room Mr Coulson poor soul And now its Maytime again

A true heart went on old man Coulson a little wanderingly that
the springtime has brought to life again andbut what will my
daughter say Mrs Widdup

Never fear sir said Mrs Widdup cheerfully Miss Coulson she
ran away with the iceman last night sir

A TECHNICAL ERROR


I never cared especially for feuds believing them to be even more
overrated products of our country than grapefruit scrapple or
honeymoons Nevertheless if I may be allowed I will tell you of an
Indian Territory feud of which I was pressagent campfollower and
inaccessory during the fact

I was on a visit to Sam Durkees ranch where I had a great time
falling off unmanicured ponies and waving my bare hand at the lower
jaws of wolves about two miles away Sam was a hardened person of
about twentyfive with a reputation for going home in the dark with
perfect equanimity though often with reluctance

Over in the Creek Nation was a family bearing the name of Tatum I
was told that the Durkees and Tatums had been feuding for years
Several of each family had bitten the grass and it was expected that
more Nebuchadnezzars would follow A younger generation of each
family was growing up and the grass was keeping pace with them But I
gathered that they had fought fairly that they had not lain in
cornfields and aimed at the division of their enemies suspenders in
the backpartly perhaps because there were no cornfields and
nobody wore more than one suspender Nor had any woman or child of
either house ever been harmed In those daysand you will find it
so yettheir women were safe

Sam Durkee had a girl If it were an allfiction magazine that I
expect to sell this story to I should say Mr Durkee rejoiced in a
fiancee Her name was Ella Baynes They appeared to be devoted to
each other and to have perfect confidence in each other as all
couples do who are and have or arent and havent She was tolerably
pretty with a heavy mass of brown hair that helped her along He
introduced me to her which seemed not to lessen her preference for
him so I reasoned that they were surely soulmates

Miss Baynes lived in Kingfisher twenty miles from the ranch Sam
lived on a gallop between the two places

One day there came to Kingfisher a courageous young man rather small
with smooth face and regular features He made many inquiries about
the business of the town and especially of the inhabitants
cognominally He said he was from Muscogee and he looked it with
his yellow shoes and crocheted fourinhand I met him once when I
rode in for the mail He said his name was Beverly Travers which
seemed rather improbable

There were active times on the ranch just then and Sam was too busy
to go to town often As an incompetent and generally worthless guest
it devolved upon me to ride in for little things such as post cards
barrels of flour bakingpowder smokingtobacco andletters from
Ella

One day when I was messenger for half a gross of cigarette papers
and a couple of wagon tires I saw the alleged Beverly Travers in a
yellowwheeled buggy with Ella Baynes driving about town as
ostentatiously as the black waxy mud would permit I knew that
this information would bring no balm of Gilead to Sams soul so I
refrained from including it in the news of the city that I retailed
on my return But on the next afternoon an elongated excowboy of
the name of Simmons an oldtime pal of Sams who kept a feed store
in Kingfisher rode out to the ranch and rolled and burned many
cigarettes before he would talk When he did make oration his words
were these

Say Sam theres been a description of a galoot miscallin himself
Beveledged Travels impairing the atmospheric air of Kingfisher for
the past two weeks You know who he was He was not otherwise than
Ben Tatum from the Creek Nation son of old Gopher Tatum that your
Uncle Newt shot last February You know what he done this morning
He killed your brother Lestershot him in the cothouse yard

I wondered if Sam had heard He pulled a twig from a mesquite bush
chewed it gravely and said

He did did he He killed Lester

The same said Simmons And he did more He run away with your
girl the same as to say Miss Ella Baynes I thought you might like
to know so I rode out to impart the information

I am much obliged Jim said Sam taking the chewed twig from his
mouth Yes Im glad you rode Out Yes Im right glad

Well Ill be ridin back I reckon That boy I left in the feed
store dont know hay from oats He shot Lester in the back

Shot him in the back

Yes while he was hitchin his hoss

Im much obliged Jim

I kind of thought youd like to know as soon as you could

Come in and have some coffee before you ride back Jim

Why no I reckon not I must get back to the store

And you say

Yes Sam Everybody seen em drive away together in a buckboard
with a big bundle like clothes tied up in the back of it He was
drivin the team he brought over with him from Muscogee Theyll be
hard to overtake right away

And which

I was goin on to tell you They left on the Guthrie road but
theres no tellin which forks theyll takeyou know that

All right Jim much obliged

Youre welcome Sam

Simmons rolled a cigarette and stabbed his pony with both heels
Twenty yards away he reined up and called back

You dont want noassistance as you might say

Not any thanks

I didnt think you would Well so long

Sam took out and opened a bonehandled pocketknife and scraped a
dried piece of mud from his left boot I thought at first he was
going to swear a vendetta on the blade of it or recite The Gipsys
Curse The few feuds I had ever seen or read about usually opened
that way This one seemed to be presented with a new treatment
Thus offered on the stage it would have been hissed off and one of
Belascos thrilling melodramas demanded instead

I wonder said Sam with a profoundly thoughtful expression if the
cook has any cold beans left over

He called Wash the Negro cook and finding that he had some ordered
him to heat up the pot and make some strong coffee Then we went into
Sams private room where he slept and kept his armoury dogs and the
saddles of his favourite mounts He took three or four sixshooters
out of a bookcase and began to look them over whistling The Cowboys
Lament abstractedly Afterward he ordered the two best horses on the
ranch saddled and tied to the hitchingpost

Now in the feud business in all sections of the country I have
observed that in one particular there is a delicate but strict
etiquette belonging You must not mention the word or refer to the
subject in the presence of a feudist It would be more reprehensible
than commenting upon the mole on the chin of your rich aunt I found
later on that there is another unwritten rule but I think that
belongs solely to the West

It yet lacked two hours to suppertime but in twenty minutes Sam and
I were plunging deep into the reheated beans hot coffee and cold
beef

Nothing like a good meal before a long ride said Sam Eat hearty

I had a sudden suspicion

Why did you have two horses saddled I asked

One twoone two said Sam You can count cant you

His mathematics carried with it a momentary qualm and a lesson The
thought had not occurred to him that the thought could possibly occur
to me not to ride at his side on that red road to revenge and justice
It was the higher calculus I was booked for the trail I began to
eat more beans

In an hour we set forth at a steady gallop eastward Our horses were
Kentuckybred strengthened by the mesquite grass of the west Ben
Tatums steeds may have been swifter and he had a good lead but if
he had heard the punctual thuds of the hoofs of those trailers of
ours born in the heart of feudland he might have felt that
retribution was creeping up on the hoofprints of his dapper nags

I knew that Ben Tatums card to play was flightflight until he
came within the safer territory of his own henchmen and supporters
He knew that the man pursuing him would follow the trail to any end
where it might lead

During the ride Sam talked of the prospect for rain of the price of
beef and of the musical glasses You would have thought he had never
had a brother or a sweetheart or an enemy on earth There are some
subjects too big even for the words in the Unabridged Knowing
this phase of the feud code but not having practised it sufficiently
I overdid the thing by telling some slightly funny anecdotes Sam
laughed at exactly the right placelaughed with his mouth When I
caught sight of his mouth I wished I had been blessed with enough
sense of humour to have suppressed those anecdotes

Our first sight of them we had in Guthrie Tired and hungry we
stumbled unwashed into a little yellowpine hotel and sat at a
table In the opposite corner we saw the fugitives They were bent
upon their meal but looked around at times uneasily

The girl was dressed in brownone of these smooth halfshiny
silkylooking affairs with lace collar and cuffs and what I believe
they call an accordionplaited skirt She wore a thick brown veil down
to her nose and a broadbrimmed straw hat with some kind of feathers
adorning it The man wore plain dark clothes and his hair was
trimmed very short He was such a man as you might see anywhere

There they werethe murderer and the woman he had stolen There we
werethe rightful avenger according to the code and the
supernumerary who writes these words

For one time at least in the heart of the supernumerary there rose
the killing instinct For one moment he joined the force of
combatantsorally

What are you waiting for Sam I said in a whisper Let him have
it now

Sam gave a melancholy sigh

You dont understand but _he_ does he said _He_ knows Mr
Tenderfoot theres a rule out here among white men in the Nation that
you cant shoot a man when hes with a woman I never knew it to be
broke yet You _cant_ do it Youve got to get him in a gang of men or
by himself Thats why He knows it too We all know So thats
Mr Ben Tatum One of the pretty men Ill cut him out of the herd
before they leave the hotel and regulate his account

After supper the flying pair disappeared quickly Although Sam haunted
lobby and stairway and halls half the night in some mysterious way
the fugitives eluded him and in the morning the veiled lady in the
brown dress with the accordionplaited skirt and the dapper young man
with the closeclipped hair and the buckboard with the prancing nags
were gone


It is a monotonous story that of the ride so it shall be
curtailed Once again we overtook them on a road We were about
fifty yards behind They turned in the buckboard and looked at us
then drove on without whipping up their horses Their safety no
longer lay in speed Ben Tatum knew He knew that the only rock of
safety left to him was the code There is no doubt that had he
been alone the matter would have been settled quickly with Sam
Durkee in the usual way but he had something at his side that
kept still the triggerfinger of both It seemed likely that he
was no coward

So you may perceive that woman on occasions may postpone instead of
precipitating conflict between man and man But not willingly or
consciously She is oblivious of codes

Five miles farther we came upon the future great Western city of
Chandler The horses of pursuers and pursued were starved and weary
There was one hotel that offered danger to man and entertainment to
beast so the four of us met again in the dining room at the ringing
of a bell so resonant and large that it had cracked the welkin long
ago The dining room was not as large as the one at Guthrie

Just as we were eating apple piehow Ben Davises and tragedy
impinge upon each otherI noticed Sam looking with keen
intentness at our quarry where they were seated at a table across the
room The girl still wore the brown dress with lace collar and cuffs
and the veil drawn down to her nose The man bent over his plate
with his close cropped head held low

Theres a code I heard Sam say either to me or to himself that
wont let you shoot a man in the company of a woman but by thunder
there aint one to keep you from killing a woman in the company of a
man

And quicker than my mind could follow his argument he whipped a
Colts automatic from under his left arm and pumped six bullets into
the body that the brown dress coveredthe brown dress with the lace

The young person in the dark sack suit from whose head and from whose
life a womans glory had been clipped laid her head on her arms
stretched upon the table while people came running to raise Ben Tatum
from the floor in his feminine masquerade that had given Sam the
opportunity to set aside technically the obligations of the code




XI

SUITE HOMES AND THEIR ROMANCE


Few young couples in the BigCityofBluff began their married
existence with greater promise of happiness than did Mr and Mrs
Claude Turpin They felt no especial animosity toward each other
they were comfortably established in a handsome apartment house that
had a name and accommodations like those of a sleepingcar they were
living as expensively as the couple on the next floor above who had
twice their income and their marriage had occurred on a wager a
ferryboat and first acquaintance thus securing a sensational
newspaper notice with their names attached to pictures of the Queen of
Roumania and M SantosDumont

Turpins income was 200 per month On pay day after calculating the
amounts due for rent instalments on furniture and piano gas and
bills owed to the florist confectioner milliner tailor wine
merchant and cab company the Turpins would find that they still had
200 left to spend How to do this is one of the secrets of
metropolitan life

The domestic life of the Turpins was a beautiful picture to see But
you couldnt gaze upon it as you could at an oleograph of Dont Wake
Grandma or Brooklyn by Moonlight

You had to blink when looked at it and you heard a fizzing sound just
like the machine with a scope at the end of it Yes there wasnt
much repose about the picture of the Turpins domestic life It was
something like Spearing Salmon in the Columbia River or Japanese
Artillery in Action

Every day was just like another as the days are in New York In the
morning Turpin would take bromoseltzer his pocket change from under
the clock his hat no breakfast and his departure for the office At
noon Mrs Turpin would get out of bed and humour put on a kimono
airs and the water to boil for coffee

Turpin lunched downtown He came home at 6 to dress for dinner They
always dined out They strayed from the chophouse to chopsueydom
from terrace to table dhote from rathskeller to roadhouse from cafe
to casino from Marias to the Martha Washington Such is domestic
life in the great city Your vine is the mistletoe your fig tree
bears dates Your household gods are Mercury and John Howard Payne
For the wedding march you now hear only Come with the Gypsy Bride
You rarely dine at the same place twice in succession You tire of
the food and besides you want to give them time for the question of
that souvenir silver sugar bowl to blow over

The Turpins were therefore happy They made many warm and delightful
friends some of whom they remembered the next day Their home life
was an ideal one according to the rules and regulations of the Book
of Bluff

There came a time when it dawned upon Turpin that his wife was getting
away with too much money If you belong to the nearswell class in the
Big City and your income is 200 per month and you find at the end
of the month after looking over the bills for current expenses that
you yourself have spent 150 you very naturally wonder what has
become of the other 50 So you suspect your wife And perhaps you
give her a hint that something needs explanation

I say Vivien said Turpin one afternoon when they were enjoying in
rapt silence the peace and quiet of their cozy apartment youve been
creating a hiatus big enough for a dog to crawl through in this
months honorarium You havent been paying your dressmaker
anything on account have you

There was a moments silence No sounds could be heard except the
breathing of the fox terrier and the subdued monotonous sizzling of
Viviens fulvous locks against the insensate curling irons Claude
Turpin sitting upon a pillow that he had thoughtfully placed upon the
convolutions of the apartment sofa narrowly watched the riante
lovely face of his wife

Claudie dear said she touching her finger to her ruby tongue and
testing the unresponsive curling irons you do me an injustice Mme
Toinette has not seen a cent of mine since the day you paid your
tailor ten dollars on account

Turpins suspicions were allayed for the time But one day soon there
came an anonymous letter to him that read


 Watch your wife She is blowing in your money secretly I was
 a sufferer just as you are The place is No 345 Blank Street
 A word to the wise etc
 A MAN WHO KNOWS


Turpin took this letter to the captain of police of the precinct that
he lived in

My precinct is as clean as a hounds tooth said the captain The
lids shut down as close there as it is over the eye of a Williamsburg
girl when shes kissed at a party But if you think theres anything
queer at the address Ill go there with ye

On the next afternoon at 3 Turpin and the captain crept softly up the
stairs of No 345 Blank Street A dozen plainclothes men dressed in
full police uniforms so as to allay suspicion waited in the hall
below

At the top of the stairs was a door which was found to be locked
The captain took a key from his pocket and unlocked it The two men
entered

They found themselves in a large room occupied by twenty or
twentyfive elegantly clothed ladies Racing charts hung against the
walls a ticker clicked in one corner with a telephone receiver to
his ear a man was calling out the various positions of the horses in
a very exciting race The occupants of the room looked up at the
intruders but as if reassured by the sight of the captains uniform
they reverted their attention to the man at the telephone

You see said the captain to Turpin the value of an anonymous
letter No highminded and selfrespecting gentleman should
consider one worthy of notice Is your wife among this assembly Mr
Turpin

She is not said Turpin

And if she was continued the captain would she be within the
reach of the tongue of slander These ladies constitute a Browning
Society They meet to discuss the meaning of the great poet The
telephone is connected with Boston whence the parent society
transmits frequently its interpretations of the poems Be ashamed of
yer suspicions Mr Turpin

Go soak your shield said Turpin Vivien knows how to take care of
herself in a poolroom Shes not dropping anything on the ponies
There must be something queer going on here

Nothing but Browning said the captain Hear that

Thanatopsis by a nose drawled the man at the telephone

Thats not Browning thats Longfellow said Turpin who sometimes
read books

Back to the pasture exclaimed the captain Longfellow made the
pacingtowagon record of 753 way back in 1868

I believe theres something queer about this joint repeated Turpin

I dont see it said the captain

I know it looks like a poolroom all right persisted Turpin but
thats all a blind Vivien has been dropping a lot of coin somewhere
I believe theres some underhanded work going on here

A number of racing sheets were tacked close together covering a large
space on one of the walls Turpin suspicious tore several of them
down A door previously hidden was revealed Turpin placed an
ear to the crack and listened intently He heard the soft hum of many
voices low and guarded laughter and a sharp metallic clicking and
scraping as if from a multitude of tiny but busy objects

My God It is as I feared whispered Turpin to himself Summon
your men at once he called to the captain She is in there I
know

At the blowing of the captains whistle the uniformed plainclothes
men rushed up the stairs into the poolroom When they saw the
betting paraphernalia distributed around they halted surprised and
puzzled to know why they had been summoned

But the captain pointed to the locked door and bade them break it
down In a few moments they demolished it with the axes they carried
Into the other room sprang Claude Turpin with the captain at his
heels

The scene was one that lingered long in Turpins mind Nearly a score
of womenwomen expensively and fashionably clothed many beautiful
and of refined appearancehad been seated at little marbletopped
tables When the police burst open the door they shrieked and ran
here and there like gayly plumed birds that had been disturbed in a
tropical grove Some became hysterical one or two fainted several
knelt at the feet of the officers and besought them for mercy on
account of their families and social position

A man who had been seated behind a desk had seized a roll of currency
as large as the ankle of a Paradise Roof Gardens chorus girl and
jumped out of the window Half a dozen attendants huddled at one end
of the room breathless from fear

Upon the tables remained the damning and incontrovertible evidences
of the guilt of the habituees of that sinister roomdish after dish
heaped high with ice cream and surrounded by stacks of empty ones
scraped to the last spoonful

Ladies said the captain to his weeping circle of prisoners Ill
not hold any of yez Some of yez I recognize as having fine houses and
good standing in the community with hardworking husbands and childer
at home But Ill read ye a bit of a lecture before ye go In the
next room theres a 20to1 shot just dropped in under the wire three
lengths ahead of the field Is this the way ye waste your husbands
money instead of helping earn it Home wid yez The lids on the
icecream freezer in this precinct

Claude Turpins wife was among the patrons of the raided room He led
her to their apartment in stern silence There she wept so
remorsefully and besought his forgiveness so pleadingly that he forgot
his just anger and soon he gathered his penitent goldenhaired Vivien
in his arms and forgave her

Darling she murmured half sobbingly as the moonlight drifted
through the open window glorifying her sweet upturned face I know
I done wrong I will never touch ice cream again I forgot you were
not a millionaire I used to go there every day But today I felt
some strange sad presentiment of evil and I was not myself I ate
only eleven saucers

Say no more said Claude gently as he fondly caressed her waving
curls

And you are sure that you fully forgive me asked Vivien gazing at
him entreatingly with dewy eyes of heavenly blue

Almost sure little one answered Claude stooping and lightly
touching her snowy forehead with his lips Ill let you know
later on Ive got a months salary down on Vanilla to win the
threeyearold steeplechase tomorrow and if the icecream hunch
is to the good you are It againsee

THE WHIRLIGIG OF LIFE


JusticeofthePeace Benaja Widdup sat in the door of his office
smoking his elderstem pipe Halfway to the zenith the Cumberland
range rose bluegray in the afternoon haze A speckled hen swaggered
down the main street of the settlement cackling foolishly

Up the road came a sound of creaking axles and then a slow cloud of
dust and then a bullcart bearing Ransie Bilbro and his wife The
cart stopped at the Justices door and the two climbed down Ransie
was a narrow six feet of sallow brown skin and yellow hair The
imperturbability of the mountains hung upon him like a suit of armour
The woman was calicoed angled snuffbrushed and weary with unknown
desires Through it all gleamed a faint protest of cheated youth
unconscious of its loss

The Justice of the Peace slipped his feet into his shoes for the sake
of dignity and moved to let them enter

Weall said the woman in a voice like the wind blowing through pine
boughs wants a divoce She looked at Ransie to see if he noted any
flaw or ambiguity or evasion or partiality or selfpartisanship in her
statement of their business

A divoce repeated Ransie with a solemn nod Weall cant git
along together nohow Its lonesome enough fur to live in the
mountins when a man and a woman keers fur one another But when
shes aspittin like a wildcat or asullenin like a hootowl in the
cabin a man aint got no call to live with her

When hes a nocount varmint said the woman without any especial
warmth atraipsin along of scalawags and moonshiners and alayin on
his back pizen ith con whiskey and apesterin folks with a pack o
hungry triflin houns to feed

When she keeps athrowin skillet lids came Ransies antiphony
and slings bilin water on the best coondog in the Cumberlands and
sets herself agin cookin a mans victuals and keeps him awake o
nights accusin him of a sight of doins

When hes alays afightin the revenues and gits a hard name in the
mountins fur a mean man whos gwine to be able fur to sleep o
nights

The Justice of the Peace stirred deliberately to his duties He
placed his one chair and a wooden stool for his petitioners He
opened his book of statutes on the table and scanned the index
Presently he wiped his spectacles and shifted his inkstand

The law and the statutes said he air silent on the subjeck of
divoce as fur as the jurisdiction of this cot air concerned But
accordin to equity and the Constitution and the golden rule its a
bad bargin that cant run both ways If a justice of the peace can
marry a couple its plain that he is bound to be able to divoce em
This here office will issue a decree of divoce and abide by the
decision of the Supreme Cot to hold it good

Ransie Bilbro drew a small tobaccobag from his trousers pocket Out
of this he shook upon the table a fivedollar note Sold a barskin
and two foxes fur that he remarked Its all the money we got

The regular price of a divoce in this cot said the Justice air
five dollars He stuffed the bill into the pocket of his homespun
vest with a deceptive air of indifference With much bodily toil
and mental travail he wrote the decree upon half a sheet of foolscap
and then copied it upon the other Ransie Bilbro and his wife
listened to his reading of the document that was to give them freedom

Know all men by these presents that Ransie Bilbro and his wife
Ariela Bilbro this day personally appeared before me and promises
that hereinafter they will neither love honour nor obey each other
neither for better nor worse being of sound mind and body and accept
summons for divorce according to the peace and dignity of the State
Herein fail not so help you God Benaja Widdup justice of the peace
in and for the county of Piedmont State of Tennessee

The Justice was about to hand one of the documents to Ransie The
voice of Ariela delayed the transfer Both men looked at her Their
dull masculinity was confronted by something sudden and unexpected in
the woman

Judge dont you give him that air paper yit Taint all settled
nohow I got to have my rights first I got to have my alimoney
Taint no kind of a way to do fur a man to divoce his wife thout
her havin a cent fur to do with Im alayin off to be agoin up
to brother Eds up on Hogback Mountin Im bound fur to hev a par
of shoes and some snuff and things besides Ef Rance kin affod a
divoce let him pay me alimoney

Ransie Bilbro was stricken to dumb perplexity There had been no
previous hint of alimony Women were always bringing up startling and
unlookedfor issues

Justice Benaja Widdup felt that the point demanded judicial decision
The authorities were also silent on the subject of alimony But the
womans feet were bare The trail to Hogback Mountain was steep and
flinty

Ariela Bilbro he asked in official tones how much did you low
would be good and sufficient alimoney in the case befo the cot

I lowed she answered fur the shoes and all to say five dollars
That aint much fur alimoney but I reckon thatll git me to up
brother Eds

The amount said the Justice air not onreasonable Ransie Bilbro
you air ordered by the cot to pay the plaintiff the sum of five
dollars befo the decree of divoce air issued

I haint no mo money breathed Ransie heavily I done paid you
all I had

Otherwise said the Justice looking severely over his spectacles
you air in contempt of cot

I reckon if you gimme till tomorrow pleaded the husband I mout
be able to rake or scrape it up somewhars I never looked for to be
apayin no alimoney

The case air adjourned said Benaja Widdup till tomorrow when
youall will present yoselves and obey the order of the cot
Followin of which the decrees of divoce will be delivered He sat
down in the door and began to loosen a shoestring

We mout as well go down to Uncle Ziahs decided Ransie and spend
the night He climbed into the cart on one side and Ariela climbed
in on the other Obeying the flap of his rope the little red bull
slowly came around on a tack and the cart crawled away in the nimbus
arising from its wheels

Justiceofthepeace Benaja Widdup smoked his elderstem pipe Late
in the afternoon he got his weekly paper and read it until the
twilight dimmed its lines Then he lit the tallow candle on his
table and read until the moon rose marking the time for supper He
lived in the double log cabin on the slope near the girdled poplar
Going home to supper he crossed a little branch darkened by a laurel
thicket The dark figure of a man stepped from the laurels and
pointed a rifle at his breast His hat was pulled down low and
something covered most of his face

I want yo money said the figure thout any talk Im gettin
nervous and my fingers awabblin on this here trigger

Ive only got fffive dollars said the Justice producing it
from his vest pocket

Roll it up came the order and stick it in the end of this here
gunbarl

The bill was crisp and new Even fingers that were clumsy and
trembling found little difficulty in making a spill of it and
inserting it this with less ease into the muzzle of the rifle

Now I reckon you kin be goin along said the robber

The Justice lingered not on his way


The next day came the little red bull drawing the cart to the
office door Justice Benaja Widdup had his shoes on for he was
expecting the visit In his presence Ransie Bilbro handed to his
wife a fivedollar bill The officials eye sharply viewed it
It seemed to curl up as though it had been rolled and inserted into
the end of a gunbarrel But the Justice refrained from comment
It is true that other bills might be inclined to curl He handed
each one a decree of divorce Each stood awkwardly silent slowly
folding the guarantee of freedom The woman cast a shy glance
full of constraint at Ransie

I reckon youll be goin back up to the cabin she said along
ith the bullcart Theres bread in the tin box settin on the
shelf I put the bacon in the bilinpot to keep the hounds from
gittin it Dont forget to wind the clock tonight

You air agoin to your brother Eds asked Ransie with fine
unconcern

I was lowin to get along up thar afore night I aint sayin as
theyll pester theyselves any to make me welcome but I haint nowhar
else fur to go Its a right smart ways and I reckon I better be
goin Ill be asayin goodbye Ransethat is if you keer fur to
say so

I dont know as anybodys a hound dog said Ransie in a martyrs
voice fur to not want to say goodbyeless you air so anxious to
git away that you dont want me to say it

Ariela was silent She folded the fivedollar bill and her decree
carefully and placed them in the bosom of her dress Benaja Widdup
watched the money disappear with mournful eyes behind his spectacles

And then with his next words he achieved rank as his thoughts ran
with either the great crowd of the worlds sympathizers or the little
crowd of its great financiers

Be kind o lonesome in the old cabin tonight Ranse he said

Ransie Bilbro stared out at the Cumberlands clear blue now in the
sunlight He did not look at Ariela

I low it might be lonesome he said but when folks gits mad and
wants a divoce you cant make folks stay

Theres others wanted a divoce said Ariela speaking to the wooden
stool Besides nobody dont want nobody to stay

Nobody never said they didnt

Nobody never said they did I reckon I better start on now to
brother Eds

Nobody cant wind that old clock

Want me to go back along ith you in the cart and wind it fur you
Ranse

The mountaineers countenance was proof against emotion But he
reached out a big hand and enclosed Arielas thin brown one Her soul
peeped out once through her impassive face hallowing it

Them hounds shant pester you no more said Ransie I reckon I
been mean and low down You wind that clock Ariela

My heart hits in that cabin Ranse she whispered along ith you
I aint agoin to git mad no more Les be startin Ranse sos we
kin git home by sundown

Justiceofthepeace Benaja Widdup interposed as they started for the
door forgetting his presence

In the name of the State of Tennessee he said I forbid youall to
be adefyin of its laws and statutes This cot is mo than willin
and full of joy to see the clouds of discord and misunderstandin
rollin away from two lovin hearts but it air the duty of the cot
to peserve the morals and integrity of the State The cot reminds
you that you air no longer man and wife but air divoced by regular
decree and as such air not entitled to the benefits and purtenances
of the mattermonal estate

Ariela caught Ransies arm Did those words mean that she must lose
him now when they had just learned the lesson of life

But the cot air prepared went on the Justice fur to remove the
disabilities set up by the decree of divoce The cot air on hand to
perform the solemn ceremony of marrige thus fixin things up and
enablin the parties in the case to resume the honourble and
elevatin state of mattermony which they desires The fee fur
performin said ceremony will be in this case to wit five dollars

Ariela caught the gleam of promise in his words Swiftly her hand went
to her bosom Freely as an alighting dove the bill fluttered to the
Justices table Her sallow cheek coloured as she stood hand in hand
with Ransie and listened to the reuniting words

Ransie helped her into the cart and climbed in beside her The
little red bull turned once more and they set out handclasped for
the mountains

Justiceofthepeace Benaja Widdup sat in his door and took off his
shoes Once again he fingered the bill tucked down in his vest
pocket Once again he smoked his elderstem pipe Once again the
speckled hen swaggered down the main street of the settlement
cackling foolishly

A SACRIFICE HIT


The editor of the _Hearthstone Magazine_ has his own ideas about the
selection of manuscript for his publication His theory is no secret
in fact he will expound it to you willingly sitting at his mahogany
desk smiling benignantly and tapping his knee gently with his
goldrimmed eyeglasses

The _Hearthstone_ he will say does not employ a staff of
readers We obtain opinions of the manuscripts submitted to us
directly from types of the various classes of our readers

That is the editors theory and this is the way he carries it out

When a batch of MSS is received the editor stuffs every one of his
pockets full of them and distributes them as he goes about during the
day The office employees the hall porter the janitor the elevator
man messenger boys the waiters at the cafe where the editor has
luncheon the man at the newsstand where he buys his evening paper
the grocer and milkman the guard on the 530 uptown elevated train
the ticketchopper at Sixty th street the cook and maid at his
homethese are the readers who pass upon MSS sent in to the
_Hearthstone Magazine_ If his pockets are not entirely emptied by
the time he reaches the bosom of his family the remaining ones are
handed over to his wife to read after the baby goes to sleep A few
days later the editor gathers in the MSS during his regular rounds
and considers the verdict of his assorted readers

This system of making up a magazine has been very successful and the
circulation paced by the advertising rates is making a wonderful
record of speed

The _Hearthstone_ Company also publishes books and its imprint is to
be found on several successful worksall recommended says the
editor by the _Hearthstones_ army of volunteer readers Now and
then according to talkative members of the editorial staff the
_Hearthstone_ has allowed manuscripts to slip through its fingers on
the advice of its heterogeneous readers that afterward proved to be
famous sellers when brought out by other houses

For instance the gossips say The Rise and Fall of Silas Latham
was unfavourably passed upon by the elevatorman the officeboy
unanimously rejected The Boss In the Bishops Carriage was
contemptuously looked upon by the streetcar conductor The
Deliverance was turned down by a clerk in the subscription department
whose wifes mother had just begun a twomonths visit at his home
The Queens Quair came back from the janitor with the comment So
is the book

But nevertheless the _Hearthstone_ adheres to its theory and system
and it will never lack volunteer readers for each one of the widely
scattered staff from the young lady stenographer in the editorial
office to the man who shovels in coal whose adverse decision lost to
the _Hearthstone_ Company the manuscript of The Under World has
expectations of becoming editor of the magazine some day

This method of the _Hearthstone_ was well known to Allen Slayton when
he wrote his novelette entitled Love Is All Slayton had hung about
the editorial offices of all the magazines so persistently that he was
acquainted with the inner workings of every one in Gotham

He knew not only that the editor of the Hearthstone handed his MSS
around among different types of people for reading but that the
stories of sentimental loveinterest went to Miss Puffkin the
editors stenographer Another of the editors peculiar customs was to
conceal invariably the name of the writer from his readers of MSS so
that a glittering name might not influence the sincerity of their
reports

Slayton made Love Is All the effort of his life He gave it six
months of the best work of his heart and brain It was a pure
lovestory fine elevated romantic passionatea prose poem that
set the divine blessing of love I am transposing from the manuscript
high above all earthly gifts and honours and listed it in the
catalogue of heavens choicest rewards Slaytons literary ambition
was intense He would have sacrificed all other worldly possessions
to have gained fame in his chosen art He would almost have cut off
his right hand or have offered himself to the knife of the
appendicitis fancier to have realized his dream of seeing one of his
efforts published in the _Hearthstone_

Slayton finished Love Is All and took it to the _Hearthstone_ in
person The office of the magazine was in a large conglomerate
building presided under by a janitor

As the writer stepped inside the door on his way to the elevator a
potato masher flew through the hall wrecking Slaytons hat and
smashing the glass of the door Closely following in the wake of the
utensil flew the janitor a bulky unwholesome man suspenderless and
sordid panicstricken and breathless A frowsy fat woman with
flying hair followed the missile The janitors foot slipped on the
tiled floor he fell in a heap with an exclamation of despair The
woman pounced upon him and seized his hair The man bellowed lustily

Her vengeance wreaked the virago rose and stalked triumphant as
Minerva back to some cryptic domestic retreat at the rear The
janitor got to his feet blown and humiliated

This is married life he said to Slayton with a certain bruised
humour Thats the girl I used to lay awake of nights thinking
about Sorry about your hat mister Say dont snitch to the tenants
about this will yer I dont want to lose me job

Slayton took the elevator at the end of the hall and went up to the
offices of the _Hearthstone_ He left the MS of Love Is All with
the editor who agreed to give him an answer as to its availability
at the end of a week

Slayton formulated his great winning scheme on his way down It
struck him with one brilliant flash and he could not refrain from
admiring his own genius in conceiving the idea That very night he
set about carrying it into execution

Miss Puffkin the _Hearthstone_ stenographer boarded in the same house
with the author She was an oldish thin exclusive languishing
sentimental maid and Slayton had been introduced to her some time
before

The writers daring and selfsacrificing project was this He knew
that the editor of the _Hearthstone_ relied strongly upon Miss
Puffkins judgment in the manuscript of romantic and sentimental
fiction Her taste represented the immense average of mediocre women
who devour novels and stories of that type The central idea and
keynote of Love Is All was love at first sightthe enrapturing
irresistible soulthrilling feeling that compels a man or a woman
to recognize his or her spiritmate as soon as heart speaks to heart
Suppose he should impress this divine truth upon Miss Puffkin
personallywould she not surely indorse her new and rapturous
sensations by recommending highly to the editor of the _Hearthstone_
the novelette Love Is All

Slayton thought so And that night he took Miss Puffkin to the
theatre The next night he made vehement love to her in the dim
parlour of the boardinghouse He quoted freely from Love Is All
and he wound up with Miss Puffkins head on his shoulder and visions
of literary fame dancing in his head

But Slayton did not stop at lovemaking This he said to himself
was the turning point of his life and like a true sportsman he
went the limit On Thursday night he and Miss Puffkin walked over
to the Big Church in the Middle of the Block and were married

Brave Slayton Chateaubriand died in a garret Byron courted a widow
Keats starved to death Poe mixed his drinks De Quincey hit the pipe
Ade lived in Chicago James kept on doing it Dickens wore white
socks De Maupassant wore a straitjacket Tom Watson became a
Populist Jeremiah wept all these authors did these things for the
sake of literature but thou didst cap them all thou marriedst a wife
for to carve for thyself a niche in the temple of fame

On Friday morning Mrs Slayton said she would go over to the
_Hearthstone_ office hand in one or two manuscripts that the editor
had given to her to read and resign her position as stenographer

Was there anythingerthateryou particularly fancied
in the stories you are going to turn in asked Slayton with a
thumping heart

There was onea novelette that I liked so much said his wife I
havent read anything in years that I thought was half as nice and
true to life

That afternoon Slayton hurried down to the _Hearthstone_ office He
felt that his reward was close at hand With a novelette in the
_Hearthstone_ literary reputation would soon be his

The office boy met him at the railing in the outer office It was not
for unsuccessful authors to hold personal colloquy with the editor
except at rare intervals

Slayton hugging himself internally was nursing in his heart the
exquisite hope of being able to crush the office boy with his
forthcoming success

He inquired concerning his novelette The office boy went into the
sacred precincts and brought forth a large envelope thick with more
than the bulk of a thousand checks

The boss told me to tell you hes sorry said the boy but your
manuscript aint available for the magazine

Slayton stood dazed Can you tell me he stammered whether or
no Miss Puffthat is myI mean Miss Puffkinhanded in a novelette
this morning that she had been asked to read

Sure she did answered the office boy wisely I heard the old man
say that Miss Puffkin said it was a daisy The name of it was
Married for the Mazuma or a Working Girls Triumph

Say you said the office boy confidentially your names Slayton
aint it I guess I mixed cases on you without meanin to do it The
boss give me some manuscript to hand around the other day and I got
the ones for Miss Puffkin and the janitor mixed I guess its all
right though

And then Slayton looked closer and saw on the cover of his manuscript
under the title Love Is All the janitors comment scribbled with a
piece of charcoal

The  you say

THE ROADS WE TAKE


Twenty miles west of Tucson the Sunset Express stopped at a tank to
take on water Besides the aqueous addition the engine of that famous
flyer acquired some other things that were not good for it

While the fireman was lowering the feeding hose Bob Tidball Shark
Dodson and a quarterbred Creek Indian called John Big Dog climbed on
the engine and showed the engineer three round orifices in pieces of
ordnance that they carried These orifices so impressed the engineer
with their possibilities that he raised both hands in a gesture such
as accompanies the ejaculation Do tell

At the crisp command of Shark Dodson who was leader of the attacking
force the engineer descended to the ground and uncoupled the engine
and tender Then John Big Dog perched upon the coal sportively held
two guns upon the engine driver and the fireman and suggested that
they run the engine fifty yards away and there await further orders

Shark Dodson and Bob Tidball scorning to put such lowgrade ore as
the passengers through the mill struck out for the rich pocket of the
express car They found the messenger serene in the belief that the
Sunset Express was taking on nothing more stimulating and dangerous
than aqua pura While Bob was knocking this idea out of his head with
the buttend of his sixshooter Shark Dodson was already dosing the
expresscar safe with dynamite

The safe exploded to the tune of 30000 all gold and currency The
passengers thrust their heads casually out of the windows to look for
the thundercloud The conductor jerked at the bellrope which
sagged down loose and unresisting at his tug Shark Dodson and Bob
Tidball with their booty in a stout canvas bag tumbled out of the
express car and ran awkwardly in their highheeled boots to the
engine

The engineer sullenly angry but wise ran the engine according to
orders rapidly away from the inert train But before this was
accomplished the express messenger recovered from Bob Tidballs
persuader to neutrality jumped out of his car with a Winchester rifle
and took a trick in the game Mr John Big Dog sitting on the coal
tender unwittingly made a wrong lead by giving an imitation of a
target and the messenger trumped him With a ball exactly between
his shoulder blades the Creek chevalier of industry rolled off to
the ground thus increasing the share of his comrades in the loot by
onesixth each

Two miles from the tank the engineer was ordered to stop

The robbers waved a defiant adieu and plunged down the steep slope
into the thick woods that lined the track Five minutes of crashing
through a thicket of chaparral brought them to open woods where three
horses were tied to lowhanging branches One was waiting for John
Big Dog who would never ride by night or day again This animal the
robbers divested of saddle and bridle and set free They mounted the
other two with the bag across one pommel and rode fast and with
discretion through the forest and up a primeval lonely gorge Here
the animal that bore Bob Tidball slipped on a mossy boulder and broke
a foreleg They shot him through the head at once and sat down to
hold a council of flight Made secure for the present by the tortuous
trail they had travelled the question of time was no longer so big
Many miles and hours lay between them and the spryest posse that could
follow Shark Dodsons horse with trailing rope and dropped bridle
panted and cropped thankfully of the grass along the stream in the
gorge Bob Tidball opened the sack drew out double handfuls of the
neat packages of currency and the one sack of gold and chuckled with
the glee of a child

Say you old doubledecked pirate he called joyfully to Dodson
you said we could do ityou got a head for financing that knocks
the horns off of anything in Arizona

What are we going to do about a hoss for you Bob We aint got long
to wait here Theyll be on our trail before daylight in the
mornin

Oh I guess that cayuse of yournll carry double for a while
answered the sanguine Bob Well annex the first animal we come
across By jingoes we made a haul didnt we Accordin to the
marks on this money theres 3000015000 apiece

Its short of what I expected said Shark Dodson kicking softly at
the packages with the toe of his boot And then he looked pensively at
the wet sides of his tired horse

Old Bolivars mighty nigh played out he said slowly I wish that
sorrel of yours hadnt got hurt

So do I said Bob heartily but it cant be helped Bolivars got
plenty of bottomhell get us both far enough to get fresh mounts
Dang it Shark I cant help thinkin how funny it is that an
Easterner like you can come out here and give us Western fellows cards
and spades in the desperado business What part of the East was you
from anyway

New York State said Shark Dodson sitting down on a boulder and
chewing a twig I was born on a farm in Ulster County I ran away
from home when I was seventeen It was an accident my coming West I
was walkin along the road with my clothes in a bundle makin for New
York City I had an idea of goin there and makin lots of money I
always felt like I could do it I came to a place one evenin where
the road forked and I didnt know which fork to take I studied about
it for half an hour and then I took the lefthand That night I run
into the camp of a Wild West show that was travellin among the little
towns and I went West with it Ive often wondered if I wouldnt
have turned out different if Id took the other road

Oh I reckon youd have ended up about the same said Bob Tidball
cheerfully philosophical It aint the roads we take its whats
inside of us that makes us turn out the way we do

Shark Dodson got up and leaned against a tree

Id a good deal rather that sorrel of yourn hadnt hurt himself
Bob he said again almost pathetically

Same here agreed Bob he was sure a firstrate kind of a crowbait
But Bolivar hell pull us through all right Reckon wed better be
movin on hadnt we Shark Ill bag this boodle agin and well hit
the trail for higher timber

Bob Tidball replaced the spoil in the bag and tied the mouth of it
tightly with a cord When he looked up the most prominent object that
he saw was the muzzle of Shark Dodsons 45 held upon him without a
waver

Stop your funnin said Bob with a grin We got to be hittin the
breeze

Set still said Shark You aint goin to hit no breeze Bob I
hate to tell you but there aint any chance for but one of us
Bolivar hes plenty tired and he cant carry double

We been pards me and you Shark Dodson for three year Bob said
quietly Weve risked our lives together time and again Ive
always give you a square deal and I thought you was a man Ive
heard some queer stories about you shootin one or two men in a
peculiar way but I never believed em Now if youre just havin a
little fun with me Shark put your gun up and well get on Bolivar
and vamose If you mean to shootshoot you blackhearted son of a
tarantula

Shark Dodsons face bore a deeply sorrowful look You dont know how
bad I feel he sighed about that sorrel of yourn breakin his leg
Bob

The expression on Dodsons face changed in an instant to one of cold
ferocity mingled with inexorable cupidity The soul of the man showed
itself for a moment like an evil face in the window of a reputable
house

Truly Bob Tidball was never to hit the breeze again The deadly 45
of the false friend cracked and filled the gorge with a roar that the
walls hurled back with indignant echoes And Bolivar unconscious
accomplice swiftly bore away the last of the holdersup of the
Sunset Express not put to the stress of carrying double

But as Shark Dodson galloped away the woods seemed to fade from his
view the revolver in his right hand turned to the curved arm of a
mahogany chair his saddle was strangely upholstered and he opened
his eyes and saw his feet not in stirrups but resting quietly on the
edge of a quarteredoak desk


I am telling you that Dodson of the firm of Dodson  Decker Wall
Street brokers opened his eyes Peabody the confidential clerk was
standing by his chair hesitating to speak There was a confused hum
of wheels below and the sedative buzz of an electric fan

Ahem Peabody said Dodson blinking I must have fallen asleep
I had a most remarkable dream What is it Peabody

Mr Williams sir of Tracy  Williams is outside He has come to
settle his deal in X Y Z The market caught him short sir if you
remember

Yes I remember What is X Y Z quoted at today Peabody

One eightyfive sir

Then thats his price

Excuse me said Peabody rather nervously for speaking of it but
Ive been talking to Williams Hes an old friend of yours Mr
Dodson and you practically have a corner in X Y Z I thought you
mightthat is I thought you might not remember that he sold you
the stock at 98 If he settles at the market price it will take every
cent he has in the world and his home too to deliver the shares

The expression on Dodsons face changed in an instant to one of cold
ferocity mingled with inexorable cupidity The soul of the man showed
itself for a moment like an evil face in the window of a reputable
house

He will settle at one eightyfive said Dodson Bolivar cannot
carry double




XV

A BLACKJACK BARGAINER


The most disreputable thing in Yancey Gorees law office was Goree
himself sprawled in his creaky old armchair The rickety little
office built of red brick was set flush with the streetthe main
street of the town of Bethel

Bethel rested upon the foothills of the Blue Ridge Above it the
mountains were piled to the sky Far below it the turbid Catawba
gleamed yellow along its disconsolate valley

The June day was at its sultriest hour Bethel dozed in the tepid
shade Trade was not It was so still that Goree reclining in his
chair distinctly heard the clicking of the chips in the grandjury
room where the courthouse gang was playing poker From the open
back door of the office a wellworn path meandered across the grassy
lot to the courthouse The treading out of that path had cost Goree
all he ever hadfirst inheritance of a few thousand dollars next
the old family home and latterly the last shreds of his selfrespect
and manhood The gang had cleaned him out The broken gambler had
turned drunkard and parasite he had lived to see this day come when
the men who had stripped him denied him a seat at the game His word
was no longer to be taken The daily bouts at cards had arranged
itself accordingly and to him was assigned the ignoble part of the
onlooker The sheriff the county clerk a sportive deputy a gay
attorney and a chalkfaced man hailing from the valley sat at
table and the sheared one was thus tacitly advised to go and grow
more wool

Soon wearying of his ostracism Goree had departed for his office
muttering to himself as he unsteadily traversed the unlucky pathway
After a drink of corn whiskey from a demijohn under the table he had
flung himself into the chair staring in a sort of maudlin apathy
out at the mountains immersed in the summer haze The little white
patch he saw away up on the side of Blackjack was Laurel the village
near which he had been born and bred There also was the birthplace
of the feud between the Gorees and the Coltranes Now no direct heir
of the Gorees survived except this plucked and singed bird of
misfortune To the Coltranes also but one male supporter was left
Colonel Abner Coltrane a man of substance and standing a member
of the State Legislature and a contemporary with Gorees father The
feud had been a typical one of the region it had left a red record of
hate wrong and slaughter

But Yancey Goree was not thinking of feuds His befuddled brain was
hopelessly attacking the problem of the future maintenance of himself
and his favourite follies Of late old friends of the family had
seen to it that he had whereof to eat and a place to sleepbut whiskey
they would not buy for him and he must have whiskey His law business
was extinct no case had been intrusted to him in two years He had
been a borrower and a sponge and it seemed that if he fell no lower
it would be from lack of opportunity One more chancehe was saying
to himselfif he had one more stake at the game he thought he could
win but he had nothing left to sell and his credit was more than
exhausted

He could not help smiling even in his misery as he thought of the
man to whom six months before he had sold the old Goree homestead
There had come from back yan in the mountains two of the strangest
creatures a man named Pike Garvey and his wife Back yan with a
wave of the hand toward the hills was understood among the
mountaineers to designate the remotest fastnesses the unplumbed
gorges the haunts of lawbreakers the wolfs den and the boudoir of
the bear In the cabin far up on Blackjacks shoulder in the wildest
part of these retreats this odd couple had lived for twenty years
They had neither dog nor children to mitigate the heavy silence of the
hills Pike Garvey was little known in the settlements but all who
had dealt with him pronounced him crazy as a loon He acknowledged
no occupation save that of a squirrel hunter but he moonshined
occasionally by way of diversion Once the revenues had dragged him
from his lair fighting silently and desperately like a terrier and
he had been sent to states prison for two years Released he popped
back into his hole like an angry weasel

Fortune passing over many anxious wooers made a freakish flight into
Blackjacks bosky pockets to smile upon Pike and his faithful partner

One day a party of spectacled knickerbockered and altogether absurd
prospectors invaded the vicinity of the Garveys cabin Pike lifted
his squirrel rifle off the hooks and took a shot at them at long range
on the chance of their being revenues Happily he missed and the
unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer disclosing their
innocence of anything resembling law or justice Later on they
offered the Garveys an enormous quantity of ready green crisp money
for their thirtyacre patch of cleared land mentioning as an excuse
for such a mad action some irrelevant and inadequate nonsense about a
bed of mica underlying the said property

When the Garveys became possessed of so many dollars that they
faltered in computing them the deficiencies of life on Blackjack
began to grow prominent Pike began to talk of new shoes a hogshead
of tobacco to set in the corner a new lock to his rifle and leading
Martella to a certain spot on the mountainside he pointed out to her
how a small cannondoubtless a thing not beyond the scope of their
fortune in pricemight be planted so as to command and defend the
sole accessible trail to the cabin to the confusion of revenues and
meddling strangers forever

But Adam reckoned without his Eve These things represented to him
the applied power of wealth but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an
ambition that soared far above his primitive wants Somewhere in Mrs
Garveys bosom still survived a spot of femininity unstarved by twenty
years of Blackjack For so long a time the sounds in her ears had
been the scalybarks dropping in the woods at noon and the wolves
singing among the rocks at night and it was enough to have purged her
of vanities She had grown fat and sad and yellow and dull But when
the means came she felt a rekindled desire to assume the perquisites
of her sexto sit at tea tables to buy futile things to whitewash
the hideous veracity of life with a little form and ceremony So she
coldly vetoed Pikes proposed system of fortifications and
announced that they would descend upon the world and gyrate socially

And thus at length it was decided and the thing done The village
of Laurel was their compromise between Mrs Garveys preference for
one of the large valley towns and Pikes hankering for primeval
solitudes Laurel yielded a halting round of feeble social
distractions comportable with Martellas ambitions and was not
entirely without recommendation to Pike its contiguity to the
mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case fashionable
society should make it advisable

Their descent upon Laurel had been coincident with Yancey Gorees
feverish desire to convert property into cash and they bought the old
Goree homestead paying four thousand dollars ready money into the
spendthrifts shaking hands

Thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the Gorees
sprawled in his disreputable office at the end of his row spurned by
the cronies whom he had gorged strangers dwelt in the halls of his
fathers

A cloud of dust was rolling slowly up the parched street with
something travelling in the midst of it A little breeze wafted the
cloud to one side and a new brightly painted carryall drawn by a
slothful gray horse became visible The vehicle deflected from the
middle of the street as it neared Gorees office and stopped in the
gutter directly in front of his door

On the front seat sat a gaunt tall man dressed in black broadcloth
his rigid hands incarcerated in yellow kid gloves On the back seat
was a lady who triumphed over the June heat Her stout form was
armoured in a skintight silk dress of the description known as
changeable being a gorgeous combination of shifting hues She sat
erect waving a muchornamented fan with her eyes fixed stonily far
down the street However Martella Garveys heart might be rejoicing
at the pleasures of her new life Blackjack had done his work with her
exterior He had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and
inanity had imbued her with the stolidity of his crags and the
reserve of his hushed interiors She always seemed to hear whatever
her surroundings were the scalybarks falling and pattering down the
mountainside She could always hear the awful silence of Blackjack
sounding through the stillest of nights

Goree watched this solemn equipage as it drove to his door with only
faint interest but when the lank driver wrapped the reins about his
whip awkwardly descended and stepped into the office he rose
unsteadily to receive him recognizing Pike Garvey the new the
transformed the recently civilized

The mountaineer took the chair Goree offered him They who cast doubts
upon Garveys soundness of mind had a strong witness in the mans
countenance His face was too long a dull saffron in hue and
immobile as a statues Paleblue unwinking round eyes without
lashes added to the singularity of his gruesome visage Goree was at a
loss to account for the visit

Everything all right at Laurel Mr Garvey he inquired

Everything all right sir and mighty pleased is Missis Garvey and me
with the property Missis Garvey likes yo old place and she likes
the neighbourhood Society is what she lows she wants and she is
gettin of it The Rogerses the Hapgoods the Pratts and the Troys
hev been to see Missis Garvey and she hev et meals to most of thar
houses The best folks hev axed her to differnt kinds of doins I
cyant say Mr Goree that sech things suits mefur me give me
them thar Garveys huge yellowgloved hand flourished in the
direction of the mountains Thats whar I blong mongst the wild
honey bees and the bars But that aint what I come fur to say Mr
Goree Thars somethin you got what me and Missis Garvey wants to
buy

Buy echoed Goree From me Then he laughed harshly I reckon
you are mistaken about that I reckon you are mistaken about that I
sold out to you as you yourself expressed it lock stock and
barrel There isnt even a ramrod left to sell

Youve got it and we uns want it Take the money says Missis
Garvey and buy it far and squar

Goree shook his head The cupboards bare he said

Weve riz pursued the mountaineer undeflected from his object a
heap We was pore as possums and now we could hev folks to dinner
every day We been recognized Missis Garvey says by the best
society But theres somethin we need we aint got She says it
ought to been put in the ventory ov the sale but it taint thar
Take the money then says she and buy it far and squar

Out with it said Goree his racked nerves growing impatient

Garvey threw his slouch hat upon the table and leaned forward fixing
his unblinking eyes upon Gorees

Theres a old feud he said distinctly and slowly tween you uns
and the Coltranes

Goree frowned ominously To speak of his feud to a feudist is a
serious breach of the mountain etiquette The man from back yan
knew it as well as the lawyer did

Na offense he went on but purely in the way of business Missis
Garvey hev studied all about feuds Most of the quality folks in the
mountains hev em The Settles and the Goforths the Rankins and the
Boyds the Silers and the Galloways hev all been cyarin on feuds
fom twenty to a hundred year The last man to drap was when yo
uncle Jedge Paisley Goree journed cot and shot Len Coltrane fom
the bench Missis Garvey and me we come fom the po white trash
Nobody wouldnt pick a feud with we uns no mon with a famly of
treetoads Quality people everywhar says Missis Garvey has feuds
We uns aint quality but were buyin into it as fur as we can
Take the money then says Missis Garvey and buy Mr Gorees feud
far and squar

The squirrel hunter straightened a leg half across the room drew a
roll of bills from his pocket and threw them on the table

Thars two hundred dollars Mr Goree what you would call a far
price for a feud thats been lowed to run down like yourn hev
Thars only you left to cyar on yo side of it and youd make mighty
po killin Ill take it off yo hands and itll set me and Missis
Garvey up among the quality Thars the money

The little roll of currency on the table slowly untwisted itself
writhing and jumping as its folds relaxed In the silence that
followed Garveys last speech the rattling of the poker chips in the
courthouse could be plainly heard Goree knew that the sheriff had
just won a pot for the subdued whoop with which he always greeted
a victory floated across the square upon the crinkly heat waves
Beads of moisture stood on Gorees brow Stooping he drew the
wickercovered demijohn from under the table and filled a tumbler
from it

A little corn liquor Mr Garvey Of course you are joking about
what you spoke of Opens quite a new market doesnt it Feuds
Prime twofifty to three Feuds slightly damagedtwo hundred I
believe you said Mr Garvey

Goree laughed selfconsciously

The mountaineer took the glass Goree handed him and drank the whisky
without a tremor of the lids of his staring eyes The lawyer
applauded the feat by a look of envious admiration He poured his own
drink and took it like a drunkard by gulps and with shudders at the
smell and taste

Two hundred repeated Garvey Thars the money

A sudden passion flared up in Gorees brain He struck the table with
his fist One of the bills flipped over and touched his hand He
flinched as if something had stung him

Do you come to me he shouted seriously with such a ridiculous
insulting darnedfool proposition

Its far and squar said the squirrel hunter but he reached out
his hand as if to take back the money and then Goree knew that his
own flurry of rage had not been from pride or resentment but from
anger at himself knowing that he would set foot in the deeper depths
that were being opened to him He turned in an instant from an
outraged gentleman to an anxious chafferer recommending his goods

Dont be in a hurry Garvey he said his face crimson and his
speech thick I accept your ppproposition though its dirt cheap
at two hundred A ttrades all right when both ppurchaser and
bbuyer are ssatisfied Shall I wwrap it up for you Mr Garvey

Garvey rose and shook out his broadcloth Missis Garvey will be
pleased You air out of it and it stands Coltrane and Garvey Just
a scrap ov writin Mr Goree you bein a lawyer to show we traded

Goree seized a sheet of paper and a pen The money was clutched in
his moist hand Everything else suddenly seemed to grow trivial and
light

Bill of sale by all means Right title and interest in and to
   forever warrant and No Garvey well have to leave out that
defend said Goree with a loud laugh Youll have to defend this
title yourself

The mountaineer received the amazing screed that the lawyer handed
him folded it with immense labour and laced it carefully in his
pocket

Goree was standing near the window Step here he said raising his
finger and Ill show you your recently purchased enemy There he
goes down the other side of the street

The mountaineer crooked his long frame to look through the window in
the direction indicated by the other Colonel Abner Coltrane an
erect portly gentleman of about fifty wearing the inevitable long
doublebreasted frock coat of the Southern lawmaker and an old high
silk hat was passing on the opposite sidewalk As Garvey looked
Goree glanced at his face If there be such a thing as a yellow wolf
here was its counterpart Garvey snarled as his unhuman eyes followed
the moving figure disclosing long ambercoloured fangs

Is that him Why thats the man who sent me to the pententiary
once

He used to be district attorney said Goree carelessly And by
the way hes a firstclass shot

I kin hit a squirrels eye at a hundred yard said Garvey So that
thars Coltrane I made a better trade than I was thinkin Ill
take keer ov this feud Mr Goree bettern you ever did

He moved toward the door but lingered there betraying a slight
perplexity

Anything else today inquired Goree with frothy sarcasm Any
family traditions ancestral ghosts or skeletons in the closet
Prices as low as the lowest

Thar was another thing replied the unmoved squirrel hunter that
Missis Garvey was thinkin of Taint so much in my line as tother
but she wanted particlar that I should inquire and ef you was
willin pay fur it she says far and squar Thars a buryin
groun as you know Mr Goree in the yard of yo old place under
the cedars Them that lies thar is yo folks what was killed by the
Coltranes The monyments has the names on em Missis Garvey says a
famly buryin groun is a sho sign of quality She says ef we git
the feud thars somethin else ought to go with it The names on
them monyments is Goree but they can be changed to ourn by

Go Go screamed Goree his face turning purple He stretched out
both hands toward the mountaineer his fingers hooked and shaking
Go you ghoul Even a ChChinaman protects the ggraves of his
ancestorsgo

The squirrel hunter slouched out of the door to his carryall While
he was climbing over the wheel Goree was collecting with feverish
celerity the money that had fallen from his hand to the floor As
the vehicle slowly turned about the sheep with a coat of newly
grown wool was hurrying in indecent haste along the path to the
courthouse

At three oclock in the morning they brought him back to his office
shorn and unconscious The sheriff the sportive deputy the county
clerk and the gay attorney carried him the chalkfaced man from the
valley acting as escort

On the table said one of them and they deposited him there among
the litter of his unprofitable books and papers

Yance thinks a lot of a pair of deuces when hes liquored up sighed
the sheriff reflectively

Too much said the gay attorney A man has no business to play
poker who drinks as much as he does I wonder how much he dropped
tonight

Close to two hundred What I wonder is whar he got it Yance aint
had a cent fur over a month I know

Struck a client maybe Well lets get home before daylight Hell
be all right when he wakes up except for a sort of beehive about the
cranium

The gang slipped away through the early morning twilight The next
eye to gaze upon the miserable Goree was the orb of day He peered
through the uncurtained window first deluging the sleeper in a flood
of faint gold but soon pouring upon the mottled red of his flesh a
searching white summer heat Goree stirred half unconsciously
among the tables debris and turned his face from the window His
movement dislodged a heavy law book which crashed upon the floor
Opening his eyes he saw bending over him a man in a black frock
coat Looking higher he discovered a wellworn silk hat and beneath
it the kindly smooth face of Colonel Abner Coltrane

A little uncertain of the outcome the colonel waited for the other to
make some sign of recognition Not in twenty years had male members
of these two families faced each other in peace Gorees eyelids
puckered as he strained his blurred sight toward this visitor and
then he smiled serenely

Have you brought Stella and Lucy over to play he said calmly

Do you know me Yancey asked Coltrane

Of course I do You brought me a whip with a whistle in the end

So he hadtwentyfour years ago when Yanceys father was his best
friend

Gorees eyes wandered about the room The colonel understood Lie
still and Ill bring you some said he There was a pump in the yard
at the rear and Goree closed his eyes listening with rapture to the
click of its handle and the bubbling of the falling stream Coltrane
brought a pitcher of the cool water and held it for him to drink
Presently Goree sat upa most forlorn object his summer suit of flax
soiled and crumpled his discreditable head tousled and unsteady He
tried to wave one of his hands toward the colonel

Exexcuseeverything will you he said I must have drunk too
much whiskey last night and gone to bed on the table His brows
knitted into a puzzled frown

Out with the boys awhile asked Coltrane kindly

No I went nowhere I havent had a dollar to spend in the last two
months Struck the demijohn too often I reckon as usual

Colonel Coltrane touched him on the shoulder

A little while ago Yancey he began you asked me if I had brought
Stella and Lucy over to play You werent quite awake then and must
have been dreaming you were a boy again You are awake now and I
want you to listen to me I have come from Stella and Lucy to their
old playmate and to my old friends son They know that I am going
to bring you home with me and you will find them as ready with a
welcome as they were in the old days I want you to come to my house
and stay until you are yourself again and as much longer as you will
We heard of your being down in the world and in the midst of
temptation and we agreed that you should come over and play at our
house once more Will you come my boy Will you drop our old family
trouble and come with me

Trouble said Goree opening his eyes wide There was never any
trouble between us that I know of Im sure weve always been the
best friends But good Lord Colonel how could I go to your home as
I ama drunken wretch a miserable degraded spendthrift and
gambler

He lurched from the table into his armchair and began to weep maudlin
tears mingled with genuine drops of remorse and shame Coltrane
talked to him persistently and reasonably reminding him of the
simple mountain pleasures of which he had once been so fond and
insisting upon the genuineness of the invitation

Finally he landed Goree by telling him he was counting upon his help
in the engineering and transportation of a large amount of felled
timber from a high mountainside to a waterway He knew that Goree
had once invented a device for this purposea series of slides and
chutes upon which he had justly prided himself In an instant the
poor fellow delighted at the idea of his being of use to any one had
paper spread upon the table and was drawing rapid but pitifully shaky
lines in demonstration of what he could and would do

The man was sickened of the husks his prodigal heart was turning
again toward the mountains His mind was yet strangely clogged and
his thoughts and memories were returning to his brain one by one like
carrier pigeons over a stormy sea But Coltrane was satisfied with
the progress he had made

Bethel received the surprise of its existence that afternoon when a
Coltrane and a Goree rode amicably together through the town Side by
side they rode out from the dusty streets and gaping townspeople
down across the creek bridge and up toward the mountain The
prodigal had brushed and washed and combed himself to a more decent
figure but he was unsteady in the saddle and he seemed to be deep in
the contemplation of some vexing problem Coltrane left him in his
mood relying upon the influence of changed surroundings to restore
his equilibrium

Once Goree was seized with a shaking fit and almost came to a
collapse He had to dismount and rest at the side of the road The
colonel foreseeing such a condition had provided a small flask of
whisky for the journey but when it was offered to him Goree refused it
almost with violence declaring he would never touch it again By and
by he was recovered and went quietly enough for a mile or two Then
he pulled up his horse suddenly and said

I lost two hundred dollars last night playing poker Now where did
I get that money

Take it easy Yancey The mountain air will soon clear it up Well
go fishing first thing at the Pinnacle Falls The trout are jumping
there like bullfrogs Well take Stella and Lucy along and have a
picnic on Eagle Rock Have you forgotten how a hickorycuredham
sandwich tastes Yancey to a hungry fisherman

Evidently the colonel did not believe the story of his lost wealth so
Goree retired again into brooding silence

By late Afternoon they had travelled ten of the twelve miles between
Bethel and Laurel Half a mile this side of Laurel lay the old Goree
place a mile or two beyond the village lived the Coltranes The road
was now steep and laborious but the compensations were many The
tilted aisles of the forest were opulent with leaf and bird and bloom
The tonic air put to shame the pharmacopaeia The glades were dark
with mossy shade and bright with shy rivulets winking from the ferns
and laurels On the lower side they viewed framed in the near
foliage exquisite sketches of the far valley swooning in its opal
haze

Coltrane was pleased to see that his companion was yielding to the
spell of the hills and woods For now they had but to skirt the base
of Painters Cliff to cross Elder Branch and mount the hill beyond
and Goree would have to face the squandered home of his fathers Every
rock he passed every tree every foot of the rocky way was familiar
to him Though he had forgotten the woods they thrilled him like the
music of Home Sweet Home

They rounded the cliff descended into Elder Branch and paused there
to let the horses drink and splash in the swift water On the right
was a rail fence that cornered there and followed the road and
stream Inclosed by it was the old apple orchard of the home place
the house was yet concealed by the brow of the steep hill Inside and
along the fence pokeberries elders sassafras and sumac grew high
and dense At a rustle of their branches both Goree and Coltrane
glanced up and saw a long yellow wolfish face above the fence
staring at them with pale unwinking eyes The head quickly
disappeared there was a violent swaying of the bushes and an
ungainly figure ran up through the apple orchard in the direction of
the house zigzagging among the trees

Thats Garvey said Coltrane the man you sold out to Theres no
doubt but hes considerably cracked I had to send him up for
moonshining once several years ago in spite of the fact that I
believed him irresponsible Why whats the matter Yancey

Goree was wiping his forehead and his face had lost its colour Do
I look queer too he asked trying to smile Im just remembering
a few more things Some of the alcohol had evaporated from his brain
I recollect now where I got that two hundred dollars

Dont think of it said Coltrane cheerfully Later on well figure
it all out together

They rode out of the branch and when they reached the foot of the
hill Goree stopped again

Did you ever suspect I was a very vain kind of fellow Colonel he
asked Sort of foolish proud about appearances

The colonels eyes refused to wander to the soiled sagging suit of
flax and the faded slouch hat

It seems to me he replied mystified but humouring him I
remember a young buck about twenty with the tightest coat the
sleekest hair and the prancingest saddle horse in the Blue Ridge

Right you are said Goree eagerly And its in me yet though it
dont show Oh Im as vain as a turkey gobbler and as proud as
Lucifer Im going to ask you to indulge this weakness of mine in a
little matter

Speak out Yancey Well create you Duke of Laurel and Baron of Blue
Ridge if you choose and you shall have a feather out of Stellas
peacocks tail to wear in your hat

Im in earnest In a few minutes well pass the house up there on
the hill where I was born and where my people have lived for nearly a
century Strangers live there nowand look at me I am about to
show myself to them ragged and povertystricken a wastrel and a
beggar Colonel Coltrane Im ashamed to do it I want you to let me
wear your coat and hat until we are out of sight beyond I know you
think it a foolish pride but I want to make as good a showing as I
can when I pass the old place

Now what does this mean said Coltrane to himself as he
compared his companions sane looks and quiet demeanour with his
strange request But he was already unbuttoning the coat assenting
readily as if the fancy were in no wise to be considered strange

The coat and hat fitted Goree well He buttoned the former about him
with a look of satisfaction and dignity He and Coltrane were nearly
the same sizerather tall portly and erect Twentyfive years
were between them but in appearance they might have been brothers
Goree looked older than his age his face was puffy and lined the
colonel had the smooth fresh complexion of a temperate liver He put
on Gorees disreputable old flax coat and faded slouch hat

Now said Goree taking up the reins Im all right I want you to
ride about ten feet in the rear as we go by Colonel so that they can
get a good look at me Theyll see Im no back number yet by any
means I guess Ill show up pretty well to them once more anyhow
Lets ride on

He set out up the hill at a smart trot the colonel following as he
had been requested

Goree sat straight in the saddle with head erect but his eyes were
turned to the right sharply scanning every shrub and fence and
hidingplace in the old homestead yard Once he muttered to himself
Will the crazy fool try it or did I dream half of it

It was when he came opposite the little family burying ground that he
saw what he had been looking fora puff of white smoke coming from
the thick cedars in one corner He toppled so slowly to the left that
Coltrane had time to urge his horse to that side and catch him with
one arm

The squirrel hunter had not overpraised his aim He had sent the
bullet where he intended and where Goree had expected that it would
passthrough the breast of Colonel Abner Coltranes black frock
coat

Goree leaned heavily against Coltrane but he did not fall The
horses kept pace side by side and the Colonels arm kept him steady
The little white houses of Laurel shone through the trees half a mile
away Goree reached out one hand and groped until it rested upon
Coltranes fingers which held his bridle

Good friend he said and that was all

Thus did Yancey Goree as he rode past his old home make considering
all things the best showing that was in his power

THE SONG AND THE SERGEANT


Half a dozen people supping at a table in one of the upperBroadway
allnight restaurants were making too much noise Three times the
manager walked past them with a politely warning glance but their
argument had waxed too warm to be quelled by a managers gaze It was
midnight and the restaurant was filled with patrons from the theatres
of that district Some among the dispersed audiences must have
recognized among the quarrelsome sextet the faces of the players
belonging to the Carroll Comedy Company

Four of the six made up the company Another was the author of the
comedietta A Gay Coquette which the quartette of players had been
presenting with fair success at several vaudeville houses in the city
The sixth at the table was a person inconsequent in the realm of art
but one at whose bidding many lobsters had perished

Loudly the six maintained their clamorous debate No one of the Party
was silent except when answers were stormed from him by the excited
ones That was the comedian of A Gay Coquette He was a young man
with a face even too melancholy for his profession

The oral warfare of four immoderate tongues was directed at Miss
Clarice Carroll the twinkling star of the small aggregation
Excepting the downcast comedian all members of the party united in
casting upon her with vehemence the blame of some momentous
misfortune Fifty times they told her It is your fault Clariceit
is you alone who spoilt the scene It is only of late that you have
acted this way At this rate the sketch will have to be taken off

Miss Carroll was a match for any four Gallic ancestry gave her a
vivacity that could easily mount to fury Her large eyes flashed a
scorching denial at her accusers Her slender eloquent arms
constantly menaced the tableware Her high clear soprano voice rose
to what would have been a scream had it not possessed so pure a
musical quality She hurled back at the attacking four their
denunciations in tones sweet but of too great carrying power for a
Broadway restaurant

Finally they exhausted her patience both as a woman and an artist
She sprang up like a panther managed to smash half a dozen plates and
glasses with one royal sweep of her arm and defied her critics They
rose and wrangled more loudly The comedian sighed and looked a
trifle sadder and disinterested The manager came tripping and
suggested peace He was told to go to the popular synonym for war so
promptly that the affair might have happened at The Hague

Thus was the manager angered He made a sign with his hand and a
waiter slipped out of the door In twenty minutes the party of six
was in a police station facing a grizzled and philosophical desk
sergeant

Disorderly conduct in a restaurant said the policeman who had
brought the party in

The author of A Gay Coquette stepped to the front He wore
noseglasses and evening clothes even if his shoes had been tans
before they met the patentleatherpolish bottle

Mr Sergeant said he out of his throat like Actor Irving I
would like to protest against this arrest The company of actors who
are performing in a little play that I have written in company with a
friend and myself were having a little supper We became deeply
interested in the discussion as to which one of the cast is
responsible for a scene in the sketch that lately has fallen so flat
that the piece is about to become a failure We may have been rather
noisy and intolerant of interruption by the restaurant people but the
matter was of considerable importance to all of us You see that we
are sober and are not the kind of people who desire to raise
disturbances I hope that the case will not be pressed and that we may
be allowed to go

Who makes the charge asked the sergeant

Me said a whiteaproned voice in the rear De restaurant sent me
to De gang was raisin a roughhouse and breakin dishes

The dishes were paid for said the playwright They were not broken
purposely In her anger because we remonstrated with her for
spoiling the scene Miss

Its not true sergeant cried the clear voice of Miss Clarice
Carroll In a long coat of tan silk and a redplumed hat she
bounded before the desk

Its not my fault she cried indignantly How dare they say such
a thing Ive played the title role ever since it was staged and if
you want to know who made it a success ask the publicthats all

What Miss Carroll says is true in part said the author For five
months the comedietta was a drawingcard in the best houses But
during the last two weeks it has lost favour There is one scene in
it in which Miss Carroll made a big hit Now she hardly gets a hand
out of it She spoils it by acting it entirely different from her old
way

It is not my fault reiterated the actress

There are only two of you on in the scene argued the playwright
hotly you and Delmars here

Then its his fault declared Miss Carroll with a lightning glance
of scorn from her dark eyes The comedian caught it and gazed with
increased melancholy at the panels of the sergeants desk

The night was a dull one in that particular police station

The sergeants longblunted curiosity awoke a little

Ive heard you he said to the author And then he addressed the
thinfaced and asceticlooking lady of the company who played Aunt
Turniptop in the little comedy

Who do you think spoils the scene you are fussing about he asked

Im no knocker said that lady and everybody knows it So when I
say that Clarice falls down every time in that scene Im judging her
art and not herself She was great in it once She does it something
fierce now Itll dope the show if she keeps it up

The sergeant looked at the comedian

You and the lady have this scene together I understand I suppose
theres no use asking you which one of you queers it

The comedian avoided the direct rays from the two fixed stars of Miss
Carrolls eyes

I dont know he said looking down at his patentleather toes

Are you one of the actors asked the sergeant of a dwarfish youth
with a middleaged face

Why say replied the last Thespian witness you dont notice any
tin spear in my hands do you You havent heard me shout See the
Emperor comes since Ive been in here have you I guess Im on the
stage long enough for em not to start a panic by mistaking me for a
thin curl of smoke rising above the footlights

In your opinion if youve got one said the sergeant is the frost
that gathers on the scene in question the work of the lady or the
gentleman who takes part in it

The middleaged youth looked pained

I regret to say he answered that Miss Carroll seems to have
lost her grip on that scene Shes all right in the rest of the
play butbut I tell you sergeant she can do itshe has done
it equal to any of emand she can do it again

Miss Carroll ran forward glowing and palpitating

Thank you Jimmy for the first good word Ive had in many a day
she cried And then she turned her eager face toward the desk

Ill show you sergeant whether I am to blame Ill show them
whether I can do that scene Come Mr Delmars let us begin You
will let us wont you sergeant

How long will it take asked the sergeant dubiously

Eight minutes said the playwright The entire play consumes but
thirty

You may go ahead said the sergeant Most of you seem to side
against the little lady Maybe she had a right to crack up a saucer
or two in that restaurant Well see how she does the turn before we
take that up

The matron of the police station had been standing near listening to
the singular argument She came nigher and stood near the sergeants
chair Two or three of the reserves strolled in big and yawning

Before beginning the scene said the playwright and assuming that
you have not seen a production of A Gay Coquette I will make a
brief but necessary explanation It is a musicalfarcecomedy
burlesquecomedietta As the title implies Miss Carrolls role is
that of a gay rollicking mischievous heartless coquette She
sustains that character throughout the entire comedy part of the
production And I have designed the extravaganza features so that she
may preserve and present the same coquettish idea

Now the scene in which we take exception to Miss Carrolls acting is
called the gorilla dance She is costumed to represent a wood nymph
and there is a great songanddance scene with a gorillaplayed by
Mr Delmars the comedian A tropicalforest stage is set

That used to get four and five recalls The main thing was the
acting and the danceit was the funniest thing in New York for five
months Delmarss song Ill Woo Thee to My Sylvan Home while he
and Miss Carroll were cutting hideandseek capers among the tropical
plants was a winner

Whats the trouble with the scene now asked the sergeant

Miss Carroll spoils it right in the middle of it said the
playwright wrathfully

With a wide gesture of her evermoving arms the actress waved back the
little group of spectators leaving a space in front of the desk for
the scene of her vindication or fall Then she whipped off her long
tan cloak and tossed it across the arm of the policeman who still
stood officially among them

Miss Carroll had gone to supper well cloaked but in the costume of
the tropic wood nymph A skirt of fern leaves touched her knee she
was like a hummingbirdgreen and golden and purple

And then she danced a fluttering fantastic dance so agile and light
and mazy in her steps that the other three members of the Carroll
Comedy Company broke into applause at the art of it

And at the proper time Delmars leaped out at her side mimicking
the uncouth hideous bounds of the gorilla so funnily that the
grizzled sergeant himself gave a short laugh like the closing of a
padlock They danced together the gorilla dance and won a hand from
all

Then began the most fantastic part of the scenethe wooing of the
nymph by the gorilla It was a kind of dance itselfeccentric and
prankish with the nymph in coquettish and seductive retreat followed
by the gorilla as he sang Ill Woo Thee to My Sylvan Home

The song was a lyric of merit The words were nonsense as befitted
the play but the music was worthy of something better Delmars
struck into it in a rich tenor that owned a quality that shamed the
flippant words

During one verse of the song the wood nymph performed the grotesque
evolutions designed for the scene At the middle of the second verse
she stood still with a strange look on her face seeming to gaze
dreamily into the depths of the scenic forest The gorillas last
leap had brought him to her feet and there he knelt holding her
hand until he had finished the hauntinglyric that was set in the
absurd comedy like a diamond in a piece of putty

When Delmars ceased Miss Carroll started and covered a sudden flow of
tears with both hands

There cried the playwright gesticulating with violence there
you have it sergeant For two weeks she has spoiled that scene in
just that manner at every performance I have begged her to consider
that it is not Ophelia or Juliet that she is playing Do you wonder
now at our impatience Tears for the gorilla song The play is lost

Out of her bewitchment whatever it was the wood nymph flared
suddenly and pointed a desperate finger at Delmars

It is youyou who have done this she cried wildly You never
sang that song that way until lately It is your doing

I give it up said the sergeant

And then the grayhaired matron of the police station came forward
from behind the sergeants chair

Must an old woman teach you all she said She went up to Miss
Carroll and took her hand

The mans wearing his heart out for you my dear Couldnt you tell
it the first note you heard him sing All of his monkey flipflops
wouldnt have kept it from me Must you be deaf as well as blind
Thats why you couldnt act your part child Do you love him or must
he be a gorilla for the rest of his days

Miss Carroll whirled around and caught Delmars with a lightning glance
of her eye He came toward her melancholy

Did you hear Mr Delmars she asked with a catching breath

I did said the comedian It is true I didnt think there was
any use I tried to let you know with the song

Silly said the matron why didnt you speak

No no cried the wood nymph his way was the best I didnt know
butit was just what I wanted Bobby

She sprang like a green grasshopper and the comedian opened his arms
andsmiled

Get out of this roared the desk sergeant to the waiting waiter from
the restaurant Theres nothing doing here for you

ONE DOLLARS WORTH


The judge of the United States court of the district lying along the
Rio Grande border found the following letter one morning in his mail


 JUDGE
 When you sent me up for four years you made a talk
 Among other hard things you called me a rattlesnake
 Maybe I am oneanyhow you hear me rattling now
 One year after I got to the pen my daughter died of
 well they said it was poverty and the disgrace together
 Youve got a daughter Judge and Im going to make
 you know how it feels to lose one And Im going to
 bite that district attorney that spoke against me Im
 free now and I guess Ive turned to rattlesnake all right
 I feel like one I dont say much but this is my rattle
 Look out when I strike
 Yours respectfully
 RATTLESNAKE


Judge Derwent threw the letter carelessly aside It was nothing new
to receive such epistles from desperate men whom he had been called
upon to judge He felt no alarm Later on he showed the letter to
Littlefield the young district attorney for Littlefields name was
included in the threat and the judge was punctilious in matters
between himself and his fellow men

Littlefield honoured the rattle of the writer as far as it concerned
himself with a smile of contempt but he frowned a little over the
reference to the Judges daughter for he and Nancy Derwent were to be
married in the fall

Littlefield went to the clerk of the court and looked over the records
with him They decided that the letter might have been sent by Mexico
Sam a halfbreed border desperado who had been imprisoned for
manslaughter four years before Then official duties crowded the
matter from his mind and the rattle of the revengeful serpent was
forgotten

Court was in session at Brownsville Most of the cases to be tried
were charges of smuggling counterfeiting postoffice robberies and
violations of Federal laws along the border One case was that of a
young Mexican Rafael Ortiz who had been rounded up by a clever
deputy marshal in the act of passing a counterfeit silver dollar He
had been suspected of many such deviations from rectitude but this
was the first time that anything provable had been fixed upon him
Ortiz languished cozily in jail smoking brown cigarettes and waiting
for trial Kilpatrick the deputy brought the counterfeit dollar and
handed it to the district attorney in his office in the courthouse
The deputy and a reputable druggist were prepared to swear that Ortiz
paid for a bottle of medicine with it The coin was a poor
counterfeit soft dulllooking and made principally of lead It was
the day before the morning on which the docket would reach the case of
Ortiz and the district attorney was preparing himself for trial

Not much need of having in highpriced experts to prove the coins
queer is there Kil smiled Littlefield as he thumped the dollar
down upon the table where it fell with no more ring than would have
come from a lump of putty

I guess the Greasers as good as behind the bars said the deputy
easing up his holsters Youve got him dead If it had been just
one time these Mexicans cant tell good money from bad but this
little yaller rascal belongs to a gang of counterfeiters I know
This is the first time Ive been able to catch him doing the trick
Hes got a girl down there in them Mexican jacals on the river bank
I seen her one day when I was watching him Shes as pretty as a red
heifer in a flower bed

Littlefield shoved the counterfeit dollar into his pocket and slipped
his memoranda of the case into an envelope Just then a bright
winsome face as frank and jolly as a boys appeared in the doorway
and in walked Nancy Derwent

Oh Bob didnt court adjourn at twelve today until tomorrow she
asked of Littlefield

It did said the district attorney and Im very glad of it Ive
got a lot of rulings to look up and

Now thats just like you I wonder you and father dont turn
to law books or rulings or something I want you to take me out
plovershooting this afternoon Long Prairie is just alive with them
Dont say no please I want to try my new twelvebore hammerless
Ive sent to the livery stable to engage Fly and Bess for the
buckboard they stand fire so nicely I was sure you would go

They were to be married in the fall The glamour was at its
height The plovers won the dayor rather the afternoonover
the calfbound authorities Littlefield began to put his papers
away

There was a knock at the door Kilpatrick answered it A beautiful
darkeyed girl with a skin tinged with the faintest lemon colour
walked into the room A black shawl was thrown over her head and
wound once around her neck

She began to talk in Spanish a voluble mournful stream of melancholy
music Littlefield did not understand Spanish The deputy did and
he translated her talk by portions at intervals holding up his hand
to check the flow of her words

She came to see you Mr Littlefield Her names Joya Trevinas She
wants to see you aboutwell shes mixed up with that Rafael Ortiz
Shes hisshes his girl She says hes innocent She says she
made the money and got him to pass it Dont you believe her Mr
Littlefield Thats the way with these Mexican girls theyll lie
steal or kill for a fellow when they get stuck on him Never trust a
woman thats in love

Mr Kilpatrick

Nancy Derwents indignant exclamation caused the deputy to flounder
for a moment in attempting to explain that he had misquoted his own
sentiments and then he went on with the translation

She says shes willing to take his place in the jail if youll let
him out She says she was down sick with the fever and the doctor
said shed die if she didnt have medicine Thats why he passed the
lead dollar on the drug store She says it saved her life This
Rafael seems to be her honey all right theres a lot of stuff in her
talk about love and such things that you dont want to hear

It was an old story to the district attorney

Tell her said he that I can do nothing The case comes up in the
morning and he will have to make his fight before the court

Nancy Derwent was not so hardened She was looking with sympathetic
interest at Joya Trevinas and at Littlefield alternately The deputy
repeated the district attorneys words to the girl She spoke a
sentence or two in a low voice pulled her shawl closely about her
face and left the room

What did she say then asked the district attorney

Nothing special said the deputy She said If the life of the
onelets see how it went_Si la vida de ella a quien tu amas_
if the life of the girl you love is ever in danger remember Rafael
Ortiz

Kilpatrick strolled out through the corridor in the direction of the
marshals office

Cant you do anything for them Bob asked Nancy Its such a
little thingjust one counterfeit dollarto ruin the happiness
of two lives She was in danger of death and he did it to save her
Doesnt the law know the feeling of pity

It hasnt a place in jurisprudence Nan said Littlefield
especially _in re_ the district attorneys duty Ill promise you
that the prosecution will not be vindictive but the man is as good as
convicted when the case is called Witnesses will swear to his passing
the bad dollar which I have in my pocket at this moment as Exhibit
A There are no Mexicans on the jury and it will vote Mr Greaser
guilty without leaving the box


The plovershooting was fine that afternoon and in the excitement of
the sport the case of Rafael and the grief of Joya Trevinas was
forgotten The district attorney and Nancy Derwent drove out from
the town three miles along a smooth grassy road and then struck
across a rolling prairie toward a heavy line of timber on Piedra
Creek Beyond this creek lay Long Prairie the favourite haunt of the
plover As they were nearing the creek they heard the galloping of a
horse to their right and saw a man with black hair and a swarthy face
riding toward the woods at a tangent as if he had come up behind
them

Ive seen that fellow somewhere said Littlefield who had a memory
for faces but I cant exactly place him Some ranchman I suppose
taking a short cut home

They spent an hour on Long Prairie shooting from the buckboard
Nancy Derwent an active outdoor Western girl was pleased with her
twelvebore She had bagged within two brace of her companions
score

They started homeward at a gentle trot When within a hundred yards
of Piedra Creek a man rode out of the timber directly toward them

It looks like the man we saw coming over remarked Miss Derwent

As the distance between them lessened the district attorney suddenly
pulled up his team sharply with his eyes fixed upon the advancing
horseman That individual had drawn a Winchester from its scabbard
on his saddle and thrown it over his arm

Now I know you Mexico Sam muttered Littlefield to himself It
was you who shook your rattles in that gentle epistle

Mexico Sam did not leave things long in doubt He had a nice eye in
all matters relating to firearms so when he was within good rifle
range but outside of danger from No 8 shot he threw up his
Winchester and opened fire upon the occupants of the buckboard

The first shot cracked the back of the seat within the twoinch space
between the shoulders of Littlefield and Miss Derwent The next went
through the dashboard and Littlefields trouser leg

The district attorney hustled Nancy out of the buckboard to the
ground She was a little pale but asked no questions She had the
frontier instinct that accepts conditions in an emergency without
superfluous argument They kept their guns in hand and Littlefield
hastily gathered some handfuls of cartridges from the pasteboard box
on the seat and crowded them into his pockets

Keep behind the horses Nan he commanded That fellow is a ruffian
I sent to prison once Hes trying to get even He knows our shot
wont hurt him at that distance

All right Bob said Nancy steadily Im not afraid But you come
close too Whoa Bess stand still now

She stroked Besss mane Littlefield stood with his gun ready
praying that the desperado would come within range

But Mexico Sam was playing his vendetta along safe lines He was
a bird of different feather from the plover His accurate eye drew
an imaginary line of circumference around the area of danger from
birdshot and upon this line lie rode His horse wheeled to the
right and as his victims rounded to the safe side of their equine
breastwork he sent a ball through the district attorneys hat Once
he miscalculated in making a detour and overstepped his margin
Littlefields gun flashed and Mexico Sam ducked his head to the
harmless patter of the shot A few of them stung his horse which
pranced promptly back to the safety line

The desperado fired again A little cry came from Nancy Derwent
Littlefield whirled with blazing eyes and saw the blood trickling
down her cheek

Im not hurt Bobonly a splinter struck me I think he hit one
of the wheelspokes

Lord groaned Littlefield If I only had a charge of buckshot

The ruffian got his horse still and took careful aim Fly gave a
snort and fell in the harness struck in the neck Bess now
disabused of the idea that plover were being fired at broke her
traces and galloped wildly away Mexican Sam sent a ball neatly
through the fulness of Nancy Derwents shooting jacket

Lie downlie down snapped Littlefield Close to the horseflat
on the groundso He almost threw her upon the grass against the
back of the recumbent Fly Oddly enough at that moment the words
of the Mexican girl returned to his mind

If the life of the girl you love is ever in danger remember Rafael
Ortiz

Littlefield uttered an exclamation

Open fire on him Nan across the horses back Fire as fast as you
can You cant hurt him but keep him dodging shot for one minute
while I try to work a little scheme

Nancy gave a quick glance at Littlefield and saw him take out his
pocketknife and open it Then she turned her face to obey orders
keeping up a rapid fire at the enemy

Mexico Sam waited patiently until this innocuous fusillade ceased
He had plenty of time and he did not care to risk the chance of a
birdshot in his eye when it could be avoided by a little caution
He pulled his heavy Stetson low down over his face until the shots
ceased Then he drew a little nearer and fired with careful aim at
what he could see of his victims above the fallen horse

Neither of them moved He urged his horse a few steps nearer He
saw the district attorney rise to one knee and deliberately level
his shotgun He pulled his hat down and awaited the harmless rattle
of the tiny pellets

The shotgun blazed with a heavy report Mexico Sam sighed turned
limp all over and slowly fell from his horsea dead rattlesnake


At ten oclock the next morning court opened and the case of the
United States versus Rafael Ortiz was called The district attorney
with his arm in a sling rose and addressed the court

May it please your honour he said I desire to enter a _nolle
pros_ in this case Even though the defendant should be guilty
there is not sufficient evidence in the hands of the government to
secure a conviction The piece of counterfeit coin upon the
identity of which the case was built is not now available as
evidence I ask therefore that the case be stricken off

At the noon recess Kilpatrick strolled into the district attorneys
office

Ive just been down to take a squint at old Mexico Sam said the
deputy Theyve got him laid out Old Mexico was a tough outfit I
reckon The boys was wonderin down there what you shot him with
Some said it must have been nails I never see a gun carry anything
to make holes like he had

I shot him said the district attorney with Exhibit A of your
counterfeiting case Lucky thing for meand somebody elsethat
it was as bad money as it was It sliced up into slugs very nicely
Say Kil cant you go down to the jacals and find where that Mexican
girl lives Miss Derwent wants to know

A NEWSPAPER STORY


At 8 A M it lay on Giuseppis newsstand still damp from the
presses Giuseppi with the cunning of his ilk philandered on the
opposite corner leaving his patrons to help themselves no doubt on
a theory related to the hypothesis of the watched pot

This particular newspaper was according to its custom and design an
educator a guide a monitor a champion and a household counsellor
and _vade mecum_

From its many excellencies might be selected three editorials One
was in simple and chaste but illuminating language directed to
parents and teachers deprecating corporal punishment for children

Another was an accusive and significant warning addressed to a
notorious labour leader who was on the point of instigating his
clients to a troublesome strike

The third was an eloquent demand that the police force be sustained
and aided in everything that tended to increase its efficiency as
public guardians and servants

Besides these more important chidings and requisitions upon the store
of good citizenship was a wise prescription or form of procedure laid
out by the editor of the hearttoheart column in the specific case
of a young man who had complained of the obduracy of his lady love
teaching him how he might win her

Again there was on the beauty page a complete answer to a young
lady inquirer who desired admonition toward the securing of bright
eyes rosy cheeks and a beautiful countenance

One other item requiring special cognizance was a brief personal
running thus


 DEAR JACKForgive me You were right Meet me corner Madison and
 th at 830 this morning We leave at noon PENITENT


At 8 oclock a young man with a haggard look and the feverish gleam of
unrest in his eye dropped a penny and picked up the top paper as he
passed Giuseppis stand A sleepless night had left him a late riser
There was an office to be reached by nine and a shave and a hasty cup
of coffee to be crowded into the interval

He visited his barber shop and then hurried on his way He pocketed
his paper meditating a belated perusal of it at the luncheon hour
At the next corner it fell from his pocket carrying with it his pair
of new gloves Three blocks he walked missed the gloves and turned
back fuming

Just on the halfhour he reached the corner where lay the gloves and
the paper But he strangely ignored that which he had come to seek
He was holding two little hands as tightly as ever he could and
looking into two penitent brown eyes while joy rioted in his heart

Dear Jack she said I knew you would be here on time

I wonder what she means by that he was saying to himself but its
all right its all right

A big wind puffed out of the west picked up the paper from the
sidewalk opened it out and sent it flying and whirling down a side
street Up that street was driving a skittish bay to a spiderwheel
buggy the young man who had written to the hearttoheart editor for
a recipe that he might win her for whom he sighed

The wind with a prankish flurry flapped the flying newspaper against
the face of the skittish bay There was a lengthened streak of bay
mingled with the red of running gear that stretched itself out for
four blocks Then a waterhydrant played its part in the cosmogony
the buggy became matchwood as foreordained and the driver rested very
quietly where he had been flung on the asphalt in front of a certain
brownstone mansion

They came out and had him inside very promptly And there was one who
made herself a pillow for his head and cared for no curious eyes
bending over and saying Oh it was you it was you all the time
Bobby Couldnt you see it And if you die why so must I and

But in all this wind we must hurry to keep in touch with our paper

Policeman OBrine arrested it as a character dangerous to traffic
Straightening its dishevelled leaves with his big slow fingers he
stood a few feet from the family entrance of the Shandon Bells Cafe
One headline he spelled out ponderously The Papers to the Front in a
Move to Help the Police

But whisht The voice of Danny the head bartender through the
crack of the door Heres a nip for ye Mike ould man

Behind the widespread amicable columns of the press Policeman OBrine
receives swiftly his nip of the real stuff He moves away stalwart
refreshed fortified to his duties Might not the editor man view
with pride the early the spiritual the literal fruit that had
blessed his labours

Policeman OBrine folded the paper and poked it playfully under the
arm of a small boy that was passing That boy was named Johnny and he
took the paper home with him His sister was named Gladys and she
had written to the beauty editor of the paper asking for the
practicable touchstone of beauty That was weeks ago and she had
ceased to look for an answer Gladys was a pale girl with dull eyes
and a discontented expression She was dressing to go up to the
avenue to get some braid Beneath her skirt she pinned two leaves of
the paper Johnny had brought When she walked the rustling sound was
an exact imitation of the real thing

On the street she met the Brown girl from the flat below and stopped
to talk The Brown girl turned green Only silk at 5 a yard could
make the sound that she heard when Gladys moved The Brown girl
consumed by jealousy said something spiteful and went her way with
pinched lips

Gladys proceeded toward the avenue Her eyes now sparkled like
jagerfonteins A rosy bloom visited her cheeks a triumphant subtle
vivifying smile transfigured her face She was beautiful Could the
beauty editor have seen her then There was something in her answer
in the paper I believe about cultivating kind feelings toward others
in order to make plain features attractive

The labour leader against whom the papers solemn and weighty
editorial injunction was laid was the father of Gladys and Johnny He
picked up the remains of the journal from which Gladys had ravished a
cosmetic of silken sounds The editorial did not come under his eye
but instead it was greeted by one of those ingenious and specious
puzzle problems that enthrall alike the simpleton and the sage

The labour leader tore off half of the page provided himself with
table pencil and paper and glued himself to his puzzle

Three hours later after waiting vainly for him at the appointed
place other more conservative leaders declared and ruled in favour of
arbitration and the strike with its attendant dangers was averted
Subsequent editions of the paper referred in coloured inks to the
clarion tone of its successful denunciation of the labour leaders
intended designs

The remaining leaves of the active journal also went loyally to the
proving of its potency

When Johnny returned from school he sought a secluded spot and removed
the missing columns from the inside of his clothing where they had
been artfully distributed so as to successfully defend such areas as
are generally attacked during scholastic castigations Johnny
attended a private school and had had trouble with his teacher As
has been said there was an excellent editorial against corporal
punishment in that mornings issue and no doubt it had its effect

After this can any one doubt the power of the press

TOMMYS BURGLAR


At ten oclock P M Felicia the maid left by the basement door with
the policeman to get a raspberry phosphate around the corner She
detested the policeman and objected earnestly to the arrangement
She pointed out not unreasonably that she might have been allowed to
fall asleep over one of St George Rathbones novels on the third
floor but she was overruled Raspberries and cops were not created
for nothing

The burglar got into the house without much difficulty because we
must have action and not too much description in a 2000word story

In the dining room he opened the slide of his dark lantern With a
brace and centrebit he began to bore into the lock of the silvercloset

Suddenly a click was heard The room was flooded with electric light
The dark velvet portieres parted to admit a fairhaired boy of eight
in pink pajamas bearing a bottle of olive oil in his hand

Are you a burglar he asked in a sweet childish voice

Listen to that exclaimed the man in a hoarse voice Am I a
burglar Wot do you suppose I have a threedays growth of bristly
beard on my face for and a cap with flaps Give me the oil quick
and let me grease the bit so I wont wake up your mamma who is lying
down with a headache and left you in charge of Felicia who has been
faithless to her trust

Oh dear said Tommy with a sigh I thought you would be more
uptodate This oil is for the salad when I bring lunch from the
pantry for you And mamma and papa have gone to the Metropolitan to
hear De Reszke But that isnt my fault It only shows how long the
story has been knocking around among the editors If the author had
been wise hed have changed it to Caruso in the proofs

Be quiet hissed the burglar under his breath If you raise an
alarm Ill wring your neck like a rabbits

Like a chickens corrected Tommy You had that wrong You dont
wring rabbits necks

Arent you afraid of me asked the burglar

You know Im not answered Tommy Dont you suppose I know fact
from fiction If this wasnt a story Id yell like an Indian when I
saw you and youd probably tumble downstairs and get pinched on the
sidewalk

I see said the burglar that youre on to your job Go on with
the performance

Tommy seated himself in an armchair and drew his toes up under him

Why do you go around robbing strangers Mr Burglar Have you no
friends

I see what youre driving at said the burglar with a dark frown
Its the same old story Your innocence and childish insouciance is
going to lead me back into an honest life Every time I crack a crib
where theres a kid around it happens

Would you mind gazing with wolfish eyes at the plate of cold beef
that the butler has left on the dining table said Tommy Im
afraid its growing late

The burglar accommodated

Poor man said Tommy You must be hungry If you will please stand
in a listless attitude I will get you something to eat

The boy brought a roast chicken a jar of marmalade and a bottle of
wine from the pantry The burglar seized a knife and fork sullenly

Its only been an hour he grumbled since I had a lobster and a
pint of musty ale up on Broadway I wish these story writers would
let a fellow have a pepsin tablet anyhow between feeds

My papa writes books remarked Tommy

The burglar jumped to his feet quickly

You said he had gone to the opera he hissed hoarsely and with
immediate suspicion

I ought to have explained said Tommy He didnt buy the tickets
The burglar sat again and toyed with the wishbone

Why do you burgle houses asked the boy wonderingly

Because replied the burglar with a sudden flow of tears God
bless my little brownhaired boy Bessie at home

Ah said Tommy wrinkling his nose you got that answer in the
wrong place You want to tell your hardluck story before you pull
out the child stop

Oh yes said the burglar I forgot Well once I lived in
Milwaukee and

Take the silver said Tommy rising from his chair

Hold on said the burglar But I moved away I could find no
other employment For a while I managed to support my wife and
child by passing confederate money but alas I was forced to give
that up because it did not belong to the union I became desperate
and a burglar

Have you ever fallen into the hands of the police asked Tommy

I said burglar not beggar answered the cracksman

After you finish your lunch said Tommy and experience the usual
change of heart how shall we wind up the story

Suppose said the burglar thoughtfully that Tony Pastor turns out
earlier than usual tonight and your father gets in from Parsifal
at 1030 I am thoroughly repentant because you have made me think of
my own little boy Bessie and

Say said Tommy havent you got that wrong

Not on your coloured crayon drawings by B Cory Kilvert said the
burglar Its always a Bessie that I have at home artlessly
prattling to the palecheeked burglars bride As I was saying your
father opens the front door just as I am departing with admonitions
and sandwiches that you have wrapped up for me Upon recognizing me
as an old Harvard classmate he starts back in

Not in surprise interrupted Tommy with wide open eyes

He starts back in the doorway continued the burglar And then he
rose to his feet and began to shout Rah rah rah rah rah rah
rah rah rah

Well said Tommy wonderingly thats the first time I ever knew a
burglar to give a college yell when he was burglarizing a house even
in a story

Thats one on you said the burglar with a laugh I was practising
the dramatization If this is put on the stage that college touch is
about the only thing that will make it go

Tommy looked his admiration

Youre on all right he said

And theres another mistake youve made said the burglar You
should have gone some time ago and brought me the 9 gold piece your
mother gave you on your birthday to take to Bessie

But she didnt give it to me to take to Bessie said Tommy pouting

Come come said the burglar sternly Its not nice of you to
take advantage because the story contains an ambiguous sentence You
know what I mean Its mighty little I get out of these fictional
jobs anyhow I lose all the loot and I have to reform every time
and all the swag Im allowed is the blamed little folderols and
luckpieces that you kids hand over Why in one story all I got was
a kiss from a little girl who came in on me when I was opening a safe
And it tasted of molasses candy too Ive a good notion to tie this
table cover over your head and keep on into the silvercloset

Oh no you havent said Tommy wrapping his arms around his knees
Because if you did no editor would buy the story You know youve
got to preserve the unities

Sove you said the burglar rather glumly Instead of sitting here
talking impudence and taking the bread out of a poor mans mouth what
youd like to be doing is hiding under the bed and screeching at the
top of your voice

Youre right old man said Tommy heartily I wonder what they
make us do it for I think the S P C C ought to interfere Im
sure its neither agreeable nor usual for a kid of my age to butt in
when a fullgrown burglar is at work and offer him a red sled and a
pair of skates not to awaken his sick mother And look how they make
the burglars act Youd think editors would knowbut whats the
use

The burglar wiped his hands on the tablecloth and arose with a yawn

Well lets get through with it he said God bless you my little
boy you have saved a man from committing a crime this night Bessie
shall pray for you as soon as I get home and give her her orders I
shall never burglarize another houseat least not until the June
magazines are out Itll be your little sisters turn then to run in
on me while I am abstracting the U S 4 per cent from the tea urn
and buy me off with her coral necklace and a falsetto kiss

You havent got all the kicks coming to you sighed Tommy crawling
out of his chair Think of the sleep Im losing But its tough on
both of us old man I wish you could get out of the story and really
rob somebody Maybe youll have the chance if they dramatize us

Never said the burglar gloomily Between the box office and my
better impulses that your leading juveniles are supposed to awaken
and the magazines that pay on publication I guess Ill always be
broke

Im sorry said Tommy sympathetically But I cant help myself
any more than you can Its one of the canons of household fiction
that no burglar shall be successful The burglar must be foiled by
a kid like me or by a young lady heroine or at the last moment by
his old pal Red Mike who recognizes the house as one in which he
used to be the coachman You have got the worst end of it in any kind
of a story

Well I suppose I must be clearing out now said the burglar taking
up his lantern and bracebit

You have to take the rest of this chicken and the bottle of wine with
you for Bessie and her mother said Tommy calmly

But confound it exclaimed the burglar in an annoyed tone they
dont want it Ive got five cases of Chateau de Beychsvelle at home
that was bottled in 1853 That claret of yours is corked And you
couldnt get either of them to look at a chicken unless it was stewed
in champagne You know after I get out of the story I dont have so
many limitations I make a turn now and then

Yes but you must take them said Tommy loading his arms with the
bundles

Bless you young master recited the burglar obedient SecondStory
Saul will never forget you And now hurry and let me out kid Our
2000 words must be nearly up

Tommy led the way through the hall toward the front door Suddenly
the burglar stopped and called to him softly Aint there a cop out
there in front somewhere sparking the girl

Yes said Tommy but what

Im afraid hell catch me said the burglar You mustnt forget
that this is fiction

Great head said Tommy turning Come out by the back door




XX

A CHAPARRAL CHRISTMAS GIFT


The original cause of the trouble was about twenty years in growing

At the end of that time it was worth it

Had you lived anywhere within fifty miles of Sundown Ranch you would
have heard of it It possessed a quantity of jetblack hair a pair
of extremely frank deepbrown eyes and a laugh that rippled across
the prairie like the sound of a hidden brook The name of it was
Rosita McMullen and she was the daughter of old man McMullen of the
Sundown Sheep Ranch

There came riding on red roan steedsor to be more explicit on a
paint and a fleabitten sorreltwo wooers One was Madison Lane
and the other was the Frio Kid But at that time they did not call him
the Frio Kid for he had not earned the honours of special
nomenclature His name was simply Johnny McRoy

It must not be supposed that these two were the sum of the agreeable
Rositas admirers The bronchos of a dozen others champed their bits
at the long hitching rack of the Sundown Ranch Many were the
sheepseyes that were cast in those savannas that did not belong to
the flocks of Dan McMullen But of all the cavaliers Madison Lane
and Johnny McRoy galloped far ahead wherefore they are to be
chronicled

Madison Lane a young cattleman from the Nueces country won the race
He and Rosita were married one Christmas day Armed hilarious
vociferous magnanimous the cowmen and the sheepmen laying aside
their hereditary hatred joined forces to celebrate the occasion

Sundown Ranch was sonorous with the cracking of jokes and sixshooters
the shine of buckles and bright eyes the outspoken congratulations of
the herders of kine

But while the wedding feast was at its liveliest there descended upon
it Johnny McRoy bitten by jealousy like one possessed

Ill give you a Christmas present he yelled shrilly at the door
with his 45 in his hand Even then he had some reputation as an
offhand shot

His first bullet cut a neat underbit in Madison Lanes right ear The
barrel of his gun moved an inch The next shot would have been the
brides had not Carson a sheepman possessed a mind with triggers
somewhat well oiled and in repair The guns of the wedding party had
been hung in their belts upon nails in the wall when they sat at
table as a concession to good taste But Carson with great
promptness hurled his plate of roast venison and frijoles at McRoy
spoiling his aim The second bullet then only shattered the white
petals of a Spanish dagger flower suspended two feet above Rositas
head

The guests spurned their chairs and jumped for their weapons It was
considered an improper act to shoot the bride and groom at a wedding
In about six seconds there were twenty or so bullets due to be
whizzing in the direction of Mr McRoy

Ill shoot better next time yelled Johnny and therell be a next
time He backed rapidly out the door

Carson the sheepman spurred on to attempt further exploits by the
success of his platethrowing was first to reach the door McRoys
bullet from the darkness laid him low

The cattlemen then swept out upon him calling for vengeance for
while the slaughter of a sheepman has not always lacked condonement
it was a decided misdemeanour in this instance Carson was
innocent he was no accomplice at the matrimonial proceedings nor had
any one heard him quote the line Christmas comes but once a year to
the guests

But the sortie failed in its vengeance McRoy was on his horse and
away shouting back curses and threats as he galloped into the
concealing chaparral

That night was the birthnight of the Frio Kid He became the bad
man of that portion of the State The rejection of his suit by Miss
McMullen turned him to a dangerous man When officers went after him
for the shooting of Carson he killed two of them and entered upon
the life of an outlaw He became a marvellous shot with either hand
He would turn up in towns and settlements raise a quarrel at the
slightest opportunity pick off his man and laugh at the officers
of the law He was so cool so deadly so rapid so inhumanly
bloodthirsty that none but faint attempts were ever made to capture
him When he was at last shot and killed by a little onearmed Mexican
who was nearly dead himself from fright the Frio Kid had the deaths
of eighteen men on his head About half of these were killed in fair
duels depending upon the quickness of the draw The other half were
men whom he assassinated from absolute wantonness and cruelty

Many tales are told along the border of his impudent courage and
daring But he was not one of the breed of desperadoes who have
seasons of generosity and even of softness They say he never had
mercy on the object of his anger Yet at this and every Christmastide
it is well to give each one credit if it can be done for whatever
speck of good he may have possessed If the Frio Kid ever did a
kindly act or felt a throb of generosity in his heart it was once at
such a time and season and this is the way it happened


One who has been crossed in love should never breathe the odour from
the blossoms of the ratama tree It stirs the memory to a dangerous
degree

One December in the Frio country there was a ratama tree in full
bloom for the winter had been as warm as springtime That way rode
the Frio Kid and his satellite and comurderer Mexican Frank The kid
reined in his mustang and sat in his saddle thoughtful and grim
with dangerously narrowing eyes The rich sweet scent touched him
somewhere beneath his ice and iron

I dont know what Ive been thinking about Mex he remarked in his
usual mild drawl to have forgot all about a Christmas present I got
to give Im going to ride over tomorrow night and shoot Madison
Lane in his own house He got my girlRosita would have had me if
he hadnt cut into the game I wonder why I happened to overlook it
up to now

Ah shucks Kid said Mexican dont talk foolishness You know
you cant get within a mile of Mad Lanes house tomorrow night I
see old man Allen day before yesterday and he says Mad is going to
have Christmas doings at his house You remember how you shot up the
festivities when Mad was married and about the threats you made
Dont you suppose Mad Lanell kind of keep his eye open for a certain
Mr Kid You plumb make me tired Kid with such remarks

Im going repeated the Frio Kid without heat to go to Madison
Lanes Christmas doings and kill him I ought to have done it a long
time ago Why Mex just two weeks ago I dreamed me and Rosita was
married instead of her and him and we was living in a house and I
could see her smiling at me andoh hl Mex he got her and
Ill get himyes sir on Christmas Eve he got her and thens when
Ill get him

Theres other ways of committing suicide advised Mexican Why
dont you go and surrender to the sheriff

Ill get him said the Kid

Christmas Eve fell as balmy as April Perhaps there was a hint of
faraway frostiness in the air but it tingles like seltzer perfumed
faintly with late prairie blossoms and the mesquite grass

When night came the five or six rooms of the ranchhouse were
brightly lit In one room was a Christmas tree for the Lanes had a
boy of three and a dozen or more guests were expected from the nearer
ranches

At nightfall Madison Lane called aside Jim Belcher and three other
cowboys employed on his ranch

Now boys said Lane keep your eyes open Walk around the house
and watch the road well All of you know the Frio Kid as they call
him now and if you see him open fire on him without asking any
questions Im not afraid of his coming around but Rosita is Shes
been afraid hed come in on us every Christmas since we were married

The guests had arrived in buckboards and on horseback and were making
themselves comfortable inside

The evening went along pleasantly The guests enjoyed and praised
Rositas excellent supper and afterward the men scattered in groups
about the rooms or on the broad gallery smoking and chatting

The Christmas tree of course delighted the youngsters and above all
were they pleased when Santa Claus himself in magnificent white beard
and furs appeared and began to distribute the toys

Its my papa announced Billy Sampson aged six Ive seen him wear
em before

Berkly a sheepman an old friend of Lane stopped Rosita as she was
passing by him on the gallery where he was sitting smoking

Well Mrs Lane said he I suppose by this Christmas youve
gotten over being afraid of that fellow McRoy havent you Madison
and I have talked about it you know

Very nearly said Rosita smiling but I am still nervous
sometimes I shall never forget that awful time when he came so near
to killing us

Hes the most coldhearted villain in the world said Berkly The
citizens all along the border ought to turn out and hunt him down like
a wolf

He has committed awful crimes said Rosita butIdontknow
I think there is a spot of good somewhere in everybody He was not
always badthat I know

Rosita turned into the hallway between the rooms Santa Claus in
muffling whiskers and furs was just coming through

I heard what you said through the window Mrs Lane he said I
was just going down in my pocket for a Christmas present for your
husband But Ive left one for you instead Its in the room to
your right

Oh thank you kind Santa Claus said Rosita brightly

Rosita went into the room while Santa Claus stepped into the cooler
air of the yard

She found no one in the room but Madison

Where is my present that Santa said he left for me in here she
asked

Havent seen anything in the way of a present said her husband
laughing unless he could have meant me


The next day Gabriel Radd the foreman of the X O Ranch dropped into
the postoffice at Loma Alta

Well the Frio Kids got his dose of lead at last he remarked to
the postmaster

That so Howd it happen

One of old Sanchezs Mexican sheep herders did itthink of it
the Frio Kid killed by a sheep herder The Greaser saw him riding
along past his camp about twelve oclock last night and was so
skeered that he up with a Winchester and let him have it Funniest
part of it was that the Kid was dressed all up with white Angoraskin
whiskers and a regular Santy Claus rigout from head to foot Think
of the Frio Kid playing Santy

A LITTLE LOCAL COLOUR


I mentioned to Rivington that I was in search of characteristic New
York scenes and incidentssomething typical I told him without
necessarily having to spell the first syllable with an i

Oh for your writing business said Rivington you couldnt have
applied to a better shop What I dont know about little old New York
wouldnt make a sonnet to a sunbonnet Ill put you right in the
middle of so much local colour that you wont know whether you are a
magazine cover or in the erysipelas ward When do you want to begin

Rivington is a youngmanabouttown and a New Yorker by birth
preference and incommutability

I told him that I would be glad to accept his escort and guardianship
so that I might take notes of Manhattans grand gloomy and peculiar
idiosyncrasies and that the time of so doing would be at his own
convenience

Well begin this very evening said Rivington himself interested
like a good fellow Dine with me at seven and then Ill steer you
up against metropolitan phases so thick youll have to have a
kinetoscope to record em

So I dined with Rivington pleasantly at his club in Fortyeleventh
street and then we set forth in pursuit of the elusive tincture of
affairs

As we came out of the club there stood two men on the sidewalk near
the steps in earnest conversation

And by what process of ratiocination said one of them do you
arrive at the conclusion that the division of society into producing
and nonpossessing classes predicates failure when compared with
competitive systems that are monopolizing in tendency and result
inimically to industrial evolution

Oh come off your perch said the other man who wore glasses
Your premises wont come out in the wash You windjammers who apply
bandylegged theories to concrete categorical syllogisms send logical
conclusions skallybootin into the infinitesimal ragbag You cant
pull my leg with an old sophism with whiskers on it You quote Marx
and Hyndman and Kautskywhat are theyshines Tolstoihis
garret is full of rats I put it to you over the homeplate that the
idea of a cooperative commonwealth and an abolishment of competitive
systems simply takes the rag off the bush and gives me hyperesthesia
of the roopteetoop The skookum house for yours

I stopped a few yards away and took out my little notebook

Oh come ahead said Rivington somewhat nervously you dont
want to listen to that

Why man I whispered this is just what I do want to hear These
slang types are among your citys most distinguishing features Is
this the Bowery variety I really must hear more of it

If I follow you said the man who had spoken first you do not
believe it possible to reorganize society on the basis of common
interest

Shinny on your own side said the man with glasses You never
heard any such music from my foghorn What I said was that I did not
believe it practicable just now The guys with wads are not in the
frame of mind to slack up on the mazuma and the man with the portable
tin banqueting canister isnt exactly ready to join the Bible class
You can bet your variegated socks that the situation is all
spifflicated up from the Battery to breakfast What the country needs
is for some bully old bloke like Cobden or some wise guy like old Ben
Franklin to sashay up to the front and biff the niggers head with
the baseball Do you catch my smoke What

Rivington pulled me by the arm impatiently

Please come on he said Lets go see something This isnt what
you want

Indeed it is I said resisting This tough talk is the very stuff
that counts There is a picturesqueness about the speech of the lower
order of people that is quite unique Did you say that this is the
Bowery variety of slang

Oh well said Rivington giving it up Ill tell you straight
Thats one of our college professors talking He ran down for a day or
two at the club Its a sort of fad with him lately to use slang in
his conversation He thinks it improves language The man he is
talking to is one of New Yorks famous social economists Now will
you come on You cant use that you know

No I agreed I cant use that Would you call that typical of New
York

Of course not said Rivington with a sigh of relief Im glad you
see the difference But if you want to hear the real old tough Bowery
slang Ill take you down where youll get your fill of it

I would like it I said that is if its the real thing Ive
often read it in books but I never heard it Do you think it will be
dangerous to go unprotected among those characters

Oh no said Rivington not at this time of night To tell the
truth I havent been along the Bowery in a long time but I know it
as well as I do Broadway Well look up some of the typical Bowery
boys and get them to talk Itll be worth your while They talk a
peculiar dialect that you wont hear anywhere else on earth

Rivington and I went east in a Fortysecond street car and then south
on the Third avenue line

At Houston street we got off and walked

We are now on the famous Bowery said Rivington the Bowery
celebrated in song and story

We passed block after block of gents furnishing storesthe
windows full of shirts with prices attached and cuffs inside In
other windows were neckties and no shirts People walked up and down
the sidewalks

In some ways said I this reminds me of Kokomono Ind during
the peachcrating season

Rivington was nettled

Step into one of these saloons or vaudeville shows said he with a
large roll of money and see how quickly the Bowery will sustain its
reputation

You make impossible conditions said I coldly

By and by Rivington stopped and said we were in the heart of the
Bowery There was a policeman on the corner whom Rivington knew

Hallo Donahue said my guide How goes it My friend and I are
down this way looking up a bit of local colour Hes anxious to meet
one of the Bowery types Cant you put us on to something genuine in
that linesomething thats got the colour you know

Policeman Donahue turned himself about ponderously his florid face
full of goodnature He pointed with his club down the street

Sure he said huskily Here comes a lad now that was born on the
Bowery and knows every inch of it If hes ever been above Bleecker
street hes kept it to himself

A man about twentyeight or twentynine with a smooth face was
sauntering toward us with his hands in his coat pockets Policeman
Donahue stopped him with a courteous wave of his club

Evening Kerry he said Heres a couple of gents friends of
mine that want to hear you spiel something about the Bowery Can you
reel em off a few yards

Certainly Donahue said the young man pleasantly Good
evening gentlemen he said to us with a pleasant smile Donahue
walked off on his beat

This is the goods whispered Rivington nudging me with his elbow
Look at his jaw

Say cull said Rivington pushing back his hat wots doin
Me and my friends taking a look down de old linesee De copper
tipped us off dat you was wise to de bowery Is dat right

I could not help admiring Rivingtons power of adapting himself to
his surroundings

Donahue was right said the young man frankly I was brought up
on the Bowery I have been newsboy teamster pugilist member of
an organized band of toughs bartender and a sport in various
meanings of the word The experience certainly warrants the
supposition that I have at least a passing acquaintance with a few
phases of Bowery life I will be pleased to place whatever knowledge
and experience I have at the service of my friend Donahues friends

Rivington seemed ill at ease

I say he saidsomewhat entreatingly I thoughtyoure not
stringing us are you It isnt just the kind of talk we expected
You havent even said Hully gee once Do you really belong on the
Bowery

I am afraid said the Bowery boy smilingly that at some time you
have been enticed into one of the dives of literature and had the
counterfeit coin of the Bowery passed upon you The argot to which
you doubtless refer was the invention of certain of your literary
discoverers who invaded the unknown wilds below Third avenue and
put strange sounds into the mouths of the inhabitants Safe in their
homes far to the north and west the credulous readers who were
beguiled by this new dialect perused and believed Like Marco Polo
and Mungo Parkpioneers indeed but ambitious souls who could not
draw the line of demarcation between discovery and inventionthe
literary bones of these explorers are dotting the trackless wastes of
the subway While it is true that after the publication of the
mythical language attributed to the dwellers along the Bowery certain
of its pat phrases and apt metaphors were adopted and to a limited
extent used in this locality it was because our people are prompt in
assimilating whatever is to their commercial advantage To the
tourists who visited our newly discovered clime and who expected a
realization of their literary guide books they supplied the demands
of the market

But perhaps I am wandering from the question In what way can I
assist you gentlemen I beg you will believe that the hospitality of
the street is extended to all There are I regret to say many
catchpenny places of entertainment but I cannot conceive that they
would entice you

I felt Rivington lean somewhat heavily against me Say he
remarked with uncertain utterance come and have a drink with us

Thank you but I never drink I find that alcohol even in the
smallest quantities alters the perspective And I must preserve my
perspective for I am studying the Bowery I have lived in it nearly
thirty years and I am just beginning to understand its heartbeats
It is like a great river fed by a hundred alien streams Each influx
brings strange seeds on its flood strange silt and weeds and now and
then a flower of rare promise To construe this river requires a man
who can build dykes against the overflow who is a naturalist a
geologist a humanitarian a diver and a strong swimmer I love my
Bowery It was my cradle and is my inspiration I have published one
book The critics have been kind I put my heart in it I am writing
another into which I hope to put both heart and brain Consider me
your guide gentlemen Is there anything I can take you to see any
place to which I can conduct you

I was afraid to look at Rivington except with one eye

Thanks said Rivington We were looking up    that is    my
friend    confound it its against all precedent you know   
awfully obliged    just the same

In case said our friend you would like to meet some of our Bowery
young men I would be pleased to have you visit the quarters of our
East Side Kappa Delta Phi Society only two blocks east of here

Awfully sorry said Rivington but my friends got me on the jump
tonight Hes a terror when hes out after local colour Now
theres nothing I would like better than to drop in at the Kappa Delta
Phi butsome other time

We said our farewells and boarded a homebound car We had a rabbit on
upper Broadway and then I parted with Rivington on a street corner

Well anyhow said he braced and recovered it couldnt have
happened anywhere but in little old New York

Which to say the least was typical of Rivington

GEORGIAS RULING


If you should chance to visit the General Land Office step into the
draughtsmens room and ask to be shown the map of Salado County A
leisurely Germanpossibly old Kampfer himselfwill bring it to
you It will be four feet square on heavy drawingcloth The
lettering and the figures will be beautifully clear and distinct The
title will be in splendid undecipherable German text ornamented with
classic Teutonic designsvery likely Ceres or Pomona leaning
against the initial letters with cornucopias venting grapes and
wieners You must tell him that this is not the map you wish to see
that he will kindly bring you its official predecessor He will then
say Ach so and bring out a map half the size of the first dim
old tattered and faded

By looking carefully near its northwest corner you will presently come
upon the worn contours of Chiquito River and maybe if your eyes are
good discern the silent witness to this story


The Commissioner of the Land Office was of the old style his
antique courtesy was too formal for his day He dressed in fine
black and there was a suggestion of Roman drapery in his long
coatskirts His collars were undetached blame haberdashery
for the word his tie was a narrow funereal strip tied in the
same knot as were his shoestrings His gray hair was a trifle
too long behind but he kept it smooth and orderly His face was
cleanshaven like the old statesmens Most people thought it a
stern face but when its official expression was off a few had
seen altogether a different countenance Especially tender and
gentle it had appeared to those who were about him during the last
illness of his only child

The Commissioner had been a widower for years and his life outside
his official duties had been so devoted to little Georgia that people
spoke of it as a touching and admirable thing He was a reserved man
and dignified almost to austerity but the child had come below it all
and rested upon his very heart so that she scarcely missed the
mothers love that had been taken away There was a wonderful
companionship between them for she had many of his own ways being
thoughtful and serious beyond her years

One day while she was lying with the fever burning brightly in her
checks she said suddenly

Papa I wish I could do something good for a whole lot of children

What would you like to do dear asked the Commissioner Give
them a party

Oh I dont mean those kind I mean poor children who havent homes
and arent loved and cared for as I am I tell you what papa

What my own child

If I shouldnt get well Ill leave them younot _give_ you but
just lend you for you must come to mamma and me when you die too If
you can find time wouldnt you do something to help them if I ask
you papa

Hush hush dear dear child said the Commissioner holding her hot
little hand against his cheek youll get well real soon and you and
I will see what we can do for them together

But in whatsoever paths of benevolence thus vaguely premeditated the
Commissioner might tread he was not to have the company of his
beloved That night the little frail body grew suddenly too tired to
struggle further and Georgias exit was made from the great stage
when she had scarcely begun to speak her little piece before the
footlights But there must be a stage manager who understands She
had given the cue to the one who was to speak after her

A week after she was laid away the Commissioner reappeared at the
office a little more courteous a little paler and sterner with the
black frockcoat hanging a little more loosely from his tall figure

His desk was piled with work that had accumulated during the four
heartbreaking weeks of his absence His chief clerk had done what he
could but there were questions of law of fine judicial decisions
to be made concerning the issue of patents the marketing and
leasing of school lands the classification into grazing
agricultural watered and timbered of new tracts to be opened to
settlers

The Commissioner went to work silently and obstinately putting
back his grief as far as possible forcing his mind to attack the
complicated and important business of his office On the second day
after his return he called the porter pointed to a leathercovered
chair that stood near his own and ordered it removed to a lumberroom
at the top of the building In that chair Georgia would always sit
when she came to the office for him of afternoons

As time passed the Commissioner seemed to grow more silent solitary
and reserved A new phase of mind developed in him He could not
endure the presence of a child Often when a clattering youngster
belonging to one of the clerks would come chattering into the big
businessroom adjoining his little apartment the Commissioner would
steal softly and close the door He would always cross the street to
avoid meeting the schoolchildren when they came dancing along in
happy groups upon the sidewalk and his firm mouth would close into a
mere line

It was nearly three months after the rains had washed the last dead
flowerpetals from the mound above little Georgia when the landshark
firm of Hamlin and Avery filed papers upon what they considered the
fattest vacancy of the year

It should not be supposed that all who were termed landsharks
deserved the name Many of them were reputable men of good business
character Some of them could walk into the most august councils of
the State and say Gentlemen we would like to have this and that
and matters go thus But next to a three years drought and the
bollworm the Actual Settler hated the Landshark The landshark
haunted the Land Office where all the land records were kept and
hunted vacanciesthat is tracts of unappropriated public
domain generally invisible upon the official maps but actually
existing upon the ground The law entitled any one possessing
certain State scrip to file by virtue of same upon any land not
previously legally appropriated Most of the scrip was now in the
hands of the landsharks Thus at the cost of a few hundred dollars
they often secured lands worth as many thousands Naturally the
search for vacancies was lively

But oftenvery oftenthe land they thus secured though legally
unappropriated would be occupied by happy and contented settlers
who had laboured for years to build up their homes only to discover
that their titles were worthless and to receive peremptory notice to
quit Thus came about the bitter and not unjustifiable hatred felt by
the toiling settlers toward the shrewd and seldom merciful speculators
who so often turned them forth destitute and homeless from their
fruitless labours The history of the state teems with their
antagonism Mr Landshark seldom showed his face on locations from
which he should have to eject the unfortunate victims of a monstrously
tangled land system but let his emissaries do the work There was
lead in every cabin moulded into balls for him many of his brothers
had enriched the grass with their blood The fault of it all lay far
back

When the state was young she felt the need of attracting newcomers
and of rewarding those pioneers already within her borders Year
after year she issued land scripHeadrights Bounties Veteran
Donations Confederates and to railroads irrigation companies
colonies and tillers of the soil galore All required of the grantee
was that he or it should have the scrip properly surveyed upon the
public domain by the county or district surveyor and the land thus
appropriated became the property of him or it or his or its heirs and
assigns forever

In those daysand here is where the trouble beganthe states
domain was practically inexhaustible and the old surveyors with
princelyyea even Western Americanliberality gave good
measure and overflowing Often the jovial man of metes and bounds
would dispense altogether with the tripod and chain Mounted on a pony
that could cover something near a vara at a step with a pocket
compass to direct his course he would trot out a survey by counting
the beat of his ponys hoofs mark his corners and write out his
field notes with the complacency produced by an act of duty well
performed Sometimesand who could blame the surveyorwhen
the pony was feeling his oats he might step a little higher and
farther and in that case the beneficiary of the scrip might get a
thousand or two more acres in his survey than the scrip called for
But look at the boundless leagues the state had to spare However no
one ever had to complain of the pony understepping Nearly every
old survey in the state contained an excess of land

In later years when the state became more populous and land values
increased this careless work entailed incalculable trouble endless
litigation a period of riotous landgrabbing and no little
bloodshed The landsharks voraciously attacked these excesses in
the old surveys and filed upon such portions with new scrip as
unappropriated public domain Wherever the identifications of the
old tracts were vague and the corners were not to be clearly
established the Land Office would recognize the newer locations as
valid and issue title to the locators Here was the greatest
hardship to be found These old surveys taken from the pick of the
land were already nearly all occupied by unsuspecting and peaceful
settlers and thus their titles were demolished and the choice was
placed before them either to buy their land over at a double price or
to vacate it with their families and personal belongings
immediately Land locators sprang up by hundreds The country was
held up and searched for vacancies at the point of a compass
Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of splendid acres were wrested
from their innocent purchasers and holders There began a vast hegira
of evicted settlers in tattered wagons going nowhere cursing
injustice stunned purposeless homeless hopeless Their children
began to look up to them for bread and cry


It was in consequence of these conditions that Hamilton and Avery
had filed upon a strip of land about a mile wide and three miles long
comprising about two thousand acres it being the excess over
complement of the Elias Denny threeleague survey on Chiquito River
in one of the middlewestern counties This twothousandacre body
of land was asserted by them to be vacant land and improperly
considered a part of the Denny survey They based this assertion and
their claim upon the land upon the demonstrated facts that the
beginning corner of the Denny survey was plainly identified that its
field notes called to run west 5760 varas and then called for
Chiquito River thence it ran south with the meandersand so on
and that the Chiquito River was on the ground fully a mile farther
west from the point reached by course and distance To sum up there
were two thousand acres of vacant land between the Denny survey proper
and Chiquito River

One sweltering day in July the Commissioner called for the papers in
connection with this new location They were brought and heaped a
foot deep upon his deskfield notes statements sketches
affidavits connecting linesdocuments of every description that
shrewdness and money could call to the aid of Hamlin and Avery

The firm was pressing the Commissioner to issue a patent upon their
location They possesed inside information concerning a new
railroad that would probably pass somewhere near this land

The General Land Office was very still while the Commissioner was
delving into the heart of the mass of evidence The pigeons could
be heard on the roof of the old castlelike building cooing and
fretting The clerks were droning everywhere scarcely pretending
to earn their salaries Each little sound echoed hollow and loud
from the bare stoneflagged floors the plastered walls and the
ironjoisted ceiling The impalpable perpetual limestone dust that
never settled whitened a long streamer of sunlight that pierced the
tattered windowawning

It seemed that Hamlin and Avery had builded well The Denny survey was
carelessly made even for a careless period Its beginning corner
was identical with that of a welldefined old Spanish grant but its
other calls were sinfully vague The field notes contained no other
object that survivedno tree no natural object save Chiquito
River and it was a mile wrong there According to precedent the
Office would be justified in giving it its complement by course and
distance and considering the remainder vacant instead of a mere
excess

The Actual Settler was besieging the office with wild protests _in re_
Having the nose of a pointer and the eye of a hawk for the landshark
he had observed his myrmidons running the lines upon his ground
Making inquiries he learned that the spoiler had attacked his home
and he left the plough in the furrow and took his pen in hand

One of the protests the Commissioner read twice It was from a woman
a widow the granddaughter of Elias Denny himself She told how her
grandfather had sold most of the survey years before at a trivial
priceland that was now a principality in extent and value Her
mother had also sold a part and she herself had succeeded to this
western portion along Chiquito River Much of it she had been forced
to part with in order to live and now she owned only about three
hundred acres on which she had her home Her letter wound up rather
pathetically

Ive got eight children the oldest fifteen years I work all day
and half the night to till what little land I can and keep us in
clothes and books I teach my children too My neighbours is all
poor and has big families The drought kills the crops every two or
three years and then we has hard times to get enough to eat There is
ten families on this land what the landsharks is trying to rob us of
and all of them got titles from me I sold to them cheap and they
aint paid out yet but part of them is and if their land should be
took from them I would die My grandfather was an honest man and he
helped to build up this state and he taught his children to be
honest and how could I make it up to them who bought from me Mr
Commissioner if you let them landsharks take the roof from over my
children and the little from them as they has to live on whoever
again calls this state great or its government just will have a lie in
their mouths

The Commissioner laid this letter aside with a sigh Many many such
letters he had received He had never been hurt by them nor had he
ever felt that they appealed to him personally He was but the
states servant and must follow its laws And yet somehow this
reflection did not always eliminate a certain responsible feeling that
hung upon him Of all the states officers he was supremest in his
department not even excepting the Governor Broad general land laws
he followed it was true but he had a wide latitude in particular
ramifications Rather than law what he followed was Rulings
Office Rulings and precedents In the complicated and new questions
that were being engendered by the states development the
Commissioners ruling was rarely appealed from Even the courts
sustained it when its equity was apparent

The Commissioner stepped to the door and spoke to a clerk in the other
roomspoke as he always did as if he were addressing a prince of
the blood

Mr Weldon will you be kind enough to ask Mr Ashe the state
schoolland appraiser to please come to my office as soon as
convenient

Ashe came quickly from the big table where he was arranging his
reports

Mr Ashe said the Commissioner you worked along the Chiquito
River in Salado County during your last trip I believe Do you
remember anything of the Elias Denny threeleague survey

Yes sir I do the blunt breezy surveyor answered I crossed it
on my way to Block H on the north side of it The road runs with the
Chiquito River along the valley The Denny survey fronts three miles
on the Chiquito

It is claimed continued the commissioner that it fails to reach
the river by as much as a mile

The appraiser shrugged his shoulder He was by birth and instinct an
Actual Settler and the natural foe of the landshark

It has always been considered to extend to the river he said
dryly

But that is not the point I desired to discuss said the
Commissioner What kind of country is this valley portion of let us
say then the Denny tract

The spirit of the Actual Settler beamed in Ashes face

Beautiful he said with enthusiasm Valley as level as this
floor with just a little swell on like the sea and rich as cream
Just enough brakes to shelter the cattle in winter Black loamy soil
for six feet and then clay Holds water A dozen nice little houses
on it with windmills and gardens People pretty poor I guesstoo
far from marketbut comfortable Never saw so many kids in my
life

They raise flocks inquired the Commissioner

Ho ho I mean twolegged kids laughed the surveyor twolegged
and barelegged and towheaded

Children oh children mused the Commissioner as though a new
view had opened to him they raise children

Its a lonesome country Commissioner said the surveyor Can you
blame em

I suppose continued the Commissioner slowly as one carefully
pursues deductions from a new stupendous theory not all of them are
towheaded It would not be unreasonable Mr Ashe I conjecture to
believe that a portion of them have brown or even black hair

Brown and black sure said Ashe also red

No doubt said the Commissioner Well I thank you for your
courtesy in informing me Mr Ashe I will not detain you any longer
from your duties

Later in the afternoon came Hamlin and Avery big handsome genial
sauntering men clothed in white duck and lowcut shoes They
permeated the whole office with an aura of debonair prosperity They
passed among the clerks and left a wake of abbreviated given names and
fat brown cigars

These were the aristocracy of the landsharks who went in for big
things Full of serene confidence in themselves there was no
corporation no syndicate no railroad company or attorney general
too big for them to tackle The peculiar smoke of their rare fat
brown cigars was to be perceived in the sanctum of every department of
state in every committeeroom of the Legislature in every bank
parlour and every private caucusroom in the state Capital Always
pleasant never in a hurry in seeming to possess unlimited leisure
people wondered when they gave their attention to the many audacious
enterprises in which they were known to be engaged

By and by the two dropped carelessly into the Commissioners room
and reclined lazily in the big leatherupholstered armchairs They
drawled a goodnatured complaint of the weather and Hamlin told the
Commissioner an excellent story he had amassed that morning from
the Secretary of State

But the Commissioner knew why they were there He had half promised
to render a decision that day upon their location

The chief clerk now brought in a batch of duplicate certificates for
the Commissioner to sign As he traced his sprawling signature
Hollis Summerfield Comr Genl Land Office on each one the chief
clerk stood deftly removing them and applying the blotter

I notice said the chief clerk youve been going through that
Salado County location Kampfer is making a new map of Salado and
I believe is platting in that section of the county now

I will see it said the Commissioner A few moments later he went to
the draughtsmens room

As he entered he saw five or six of the draughtsmen grouped about
Kampfers desk gargling away at each other in pectoral German and
gazing at something thereupon At the Commissioners approach they
scattered to their several places Kampfer a wizened little German
with long frizzled ringlets and a watery eye began to stammer
forth some sort of an apology the Commissioner thought for the
congregation of his fellows about his desk

Never mind said the Commissioner I wish to see the map you are
making and passing around the old German seated himself upon the
high draughtsmans stool Kampfer continued to break English in
trying to explain

Herr Gommissioner I assure you blenty sat I haf not it bremeditated
sat it wasssat it itself make Look you from se field notes
wass it blattedblease to observe se calls South 10 degrees west
1050 varas south 10 degrees east 300 varas south 100 south 9
west 200 south 40 degrees west 400and so on Herr Gommissioner
nefer would I have

The Commissioner raised one white hand silently Kampfer dropped his
pipe and fled

With a hand at each side of his face and his elbows resting upon the
desk the Commissioner sat staring at the map which was spread and
fastened therestaring at the sweet and living profile of little
Georgia drawn thereuponat her face pensive delicate and
infantile outlined in a perfect likeness

When his mind at length came to inquire into the reason of it he
saw that it must have been as Kampfer had said unpremeditated The
old draughtsman had been platting in the Elias Denny survey and
Georgias likeness striking though it was was formed by nothing more
than the meanders of Chiquito River Indeed Kampfers blotter
whereon his preliminary work was done showed the laborious tracings
of the calls and the countless pricks of the compasses Then over
his faint pencilling Kampfer had drawn in India ink with a full firm
pen the similitude of Chiquito River and forth had blossomed
mysteriously the dainty pathetic profile of the child

The Commissioner sat for half an hour with his face in his hands
gazing downward and none dared approach him Then he arose and
walked out In the business office he paused long enough to ask that
the Denny file be brought to his desk

He found Hamlin and Avery still reclining in their chairs apparently
oblivious of business They were lazily discussing summer opera it
being their habitperhaps their pride alsoto appear supernaturally
indifferent whenever they stood with large interests imperilled And
they stood to win more on this stake than most people knew They
possessed inside information to the effect that a new railroad would
within a year split this very Chiquito River valley and send land
values ballooning all along its route A dollar under thirty thousand
profit on this location if it should hold good would be a loss to
their expectations So while they chatted lightly and waited for the
Commissioner to open the subject there was a quick sidelong sparkle
in their eyes evincing a desire to read their title clear to those
fair acres on the Chiquito

A clerk brought in the file The Commissioner seated himself and
wrote upon it in red ink Then he rose to his feet and stood for a
while looking straight out of the window The Land Office capped the
summit of a bold hill The eyes of the Commissioner passed over the
roofs of many houses set in a packing of deep green the whole
checkered by strips of blinding white streets The horizon where his
gaze was focussed swelled to a fair wooded eminence flecked with
faint dots of shining white There was the cemetery where lay many
who were forgotten and a few who had not lived in vain And one
lay there occupying very small space whose childish heart had been
large enough to desire while near its last beats good to others
The Commissioners lips moved slightly as he whispered to himself It
was her last will and testament and I have neglected it so long

The big brown cigars of Hamlin and Avery were fireless but they still
gripped them between their teeth and waited while they marvelled at
the absent expression upon the Commissioners face

By and by he spoke suddenly and promptly

Gentlemen I have just indorsed the Elias Denny survey for patenting
This office will not regard your location upon a part of it as legal
He paused a moment and then extending his hand as those dear oldtime
ones used to do in debate he enunciated the spirit of that Ruling that
subsequently drove the landsharks to the wall and placed the seal of
peace and security over the doors of ten thousand homes

And furthermore he continued with a clear soft light upon his
face it may interest you to know that from this time on this office
will consider that when a survey of land made by virtue of a
certificate granted by this state to the men who wrested it from the
wilderness and the savagemade in good faith settled in good faith
and left in good faith to their children or innocent purchaserswhen
such a survey although overrunning its complement shall call for
any natural object visible to the eye of man to that object it shall
hold and be good and valid And the children of this state shall
lie down to sleep at night and rumours of disturbers of title shall
not disquiet them For concluded the Commissioner of such is the
Kingdom of Heaven

In the silence that followed a laugh floated up from the patentroom
below The man who carried down the Denny file was exhibiting it
among the clerks

Look here he said delightedly the old man has forgotten his
name Hes written Patent to original grantee and signed it
Georgia Summerfield Comr

The speech of the Commissioner rebounded lightly from the impregnable
Hamlin and Avery They smiled rose gracefully spoke of the baseball
team and argued feelingly that quite a perceptible breeze had arisen
from the east They lit fresh fat brown cigars and drifted
courteously away But later they made another tigerspring for their
quarry in the courts But the courts according to reports in the
papers coolly roasted them a remarkable performance suggestive of
liquidair didoes and sustained the Commissioners Ruling

And this Ruling itself grew to be a Precedent and the Actual Settler
framed it and taught his children to spell from it and there was
sound sleep o nights from the pines to the sagebrush and from the
chaparral to the great brown river of the north

But I think and I am sure the Commissioner never thought otherwise
that whether Kampfer was a snuffy old instrument of destiny or
whether the meanders of the Chiquito accidentally platted themselves
into that memorable sweet profile or not there was brought about
something good for a whole lot of children and the result ought
to be called Georgias Ruling

BLIND MANS HOLIDAY


Alas for the man and for the artist with the shifting point of
perspective Life shall be a confusion of ways to the one the
landscape shall rise up and confound the other Take the case of
Lorison At one time he appeared to himself to be the feeblest of
fools at another he conceived that he followed ideals so fine that
the world was not yet ready to accept them During one mood he cursed
his folly possessed by the other he bore himself with a serene
grandeur akin to greatness in neither did he attain the perspective

Generations before the name had been Larsen His race had
bequeathed him its finestrung melancholy temperament its saving
balance of thrift and industry

From his point of perspective he saw himself an outcast from society
forever to be a shady skulker along the ragged edge of respectability
a denizen _des troisquartz de monde_ that pathetic spheroid lying
between the _haut_ and the _demi_ whose inhabitants envy each of their
neighbours and are scorned by both He was selfcondemned to this
opinion as he was selfexiled through it to this quaint Southern
city a thousand miles from his former home Here he had dwelt for
longer than a year knowing but few keeping in a subjective world
of shadows which was invaded at times by the perplexing bulks of
jarring realities Then he fell in love with a girl whom he met in a
cheap restaurant and his story begins


The Rue Chartres in New Orleans is a street of ghosts It lies in
the quarter where the Frenchman in his prime set up his translated
pride and glory where also the arrogant don had swaggered and
dreamed of gold and grants and ladies gloves Every flagstone has
its grooves worn by footsteps going royally to the wooing and the
fighting Every house has a princely heartbreak each doorway its
untold tale of gallant promise and slow decay

By night the Rue Chartres is now but a murky fissure from which the
groping wayfarer sees flung against the sky the tangled filigree of
Moorish iron balconies The old houses of monsieur stand yet
indomitable against the century but their essence is gone The
street is one of ghosts to whosoever can see them

A faint heartbeat of the streets ancient glory still survives in a
corner occupied by the Cafe Carabine dOr Once men gathered there to
plot against kings and to warn presidents They do so yet but they
are not the same kind of men A brass button will scatter these
those would have set their faces against an army Above the door
hangs the sign board upon which has been depicted a vast animal of
unfamiliar species In the act of firing upon this monster is
represented an unobtrusive human levelling an obtrusive gun once the
colour of bright gold Now the legend above the picture is faded
beyond conjecture the guns relation to the title is a matter of
faith the menaced animal wearied of the long aim of the hunter has
resolved itself into a shapeless blot

The place is known as Antonios as the name white upon the redlit
transparency and gilt upon the windows attests There is a promise
in Antonio a justifiable expectancy of savoury things in oil and
pepper and wine and perhaps an angels whisper of garlic But the
rest of the name is ORiley Antonio ORiley

The Carabine dOr is an ignominious ghost of the Rue Chartres The
cafe where Bienville and Conti dined where a prince has broken bread
is become a family ristaurant

Its customers are working men and women almost to a unit
Occasionally you will see chorus girls from the cheaper theatres
and men who follow avocations subject to quick vicissitudes but at
Antoniosname rich in Bohemian promise but tame in fulfillment
manners debonair and gay are toned down to the family standard
Should you light a cigarette mine host will touch you on the arrum
and remind you that the proprieties are menaced Antonio entices
and beguiles from fiery legend without but ORiley teaches decorum
within

It was at this restaurant that Lorison first saw the girl A flashy
fellow with a predatory eye had followed her in and had advanced to
take the other chair at the little table where she stopped but
Lorison slipped into the seat before him Their acquaintance began
and grew and now for two months they had sat at the same table each
evening not meeting by appointment but as if by a series of
fortuitous and happy accidents After dining they would take a walk
together in one of the little city parks or among the panoramic
markets where exhibits a continuous vaudeville of sights and sounds
Always at eight oclock their steps led them to a certain street
corner where she prettily but firmly bade him good night and left
him I do not live far from here she frequently said and you
must let me go the rest of the way alone

But now Lorison had discovered that he wanted to go the rest of the
way with her or happiness would depart leaving him on a very lonely
corner of life And at the same time that he made the discovery the
secret of his banishment from the society of the good laid its finger
in his face and told him it must not be

Man is too thoroughly an egoist not to be also an egotist if he love
the object shall know it During a lifetime he may conceal it through
stress of expediency and honour but it shall bubble from his dying
lips though it disrupt a neighbourhood It is known however that
most men do not wait so long to disclose their passion In the case
of Lorison his particular ethics positively forbade him to declare
his sentiments but he must needs dally with the subject and woo by
innuendo at least

On this night after the usual meal at the Carabine dOr he strolled
with his companion down the dim old street toward the river

The Rue Chartres perishes in the old Place dArmes The ancient
Cabildo where Spanish justice fell like hail faces it and the
Cathedral another provincial ghost overlooks it Its centre is a
little ironrailed park of flowers and immaculate gravelled walks
where citizens take the air of evenings Pedestalled high above it
the general sits his cavorting steed with his face turned stonily
down the river toward English Turn whence come no more Britons to
bombard his cotton bales

Often the two sat in this square but tonight Lorison guided her past
the stonestepped gate and still riverward As they walked he smiled
to himself to think that all he knew of herexcept that be loved
herwas her name Norah Greenway and that she lived with her
brother They had talked about everything except themselves Perhaps
her reticence had been caused by his

They came at length upon the levee and sat upon a great prostrate
beam The air was pungent with the dust of commerce The great river
slipped yellowly past Across it Algiers lay a longitudinous black
bulk against a vibrant electric haze sprinkled with exact stars

The girl was young and of the piquant order A certain bright
melancholy pervaded her she possessed an untarnished pale prettiness
doomed to please Her voice when she spoke dwarfed her theme It
was the voice capable of investing little subjects with a large
interest She sat at ease bestowing her skirts with the little
womanly touch serene as if the begrimed pier were a summer garden
Lorison poked the rotting boards with his cane

He began by telling her that he was in love with some one to whom he
durst not speak of it And why not she asked accepting swiftly
his fatuous presentation of a third person of straw My place in the
world he answered is none to ask a woman to share I am an
outcast from honest people I am wrongly accused of one crime and am
I believe guilty of another

Thence he plunged into the story of his abdication from society The
story pruned of his moral philosophy deserves no more than the
slightest touch It is no new tale that of the gamblers declension
During one nights sitting he lost and then had imperilled a certain
amount of his employers money which by accident he carried with
him He continued to lose to the last wager and then began to gain
leaving the game winner to a somewhat formidable sum The same night
his employers safe was robbed A search was had the winnings of
Lorison were found in his room their total forming an accusative
nearness to the sum purloined He was taken tried and through
incomplete evidence released smutched with the sinister _devoirs_
of a disagreeing jury

It is not in the unjust accusation he said to the girl that my
burden lies but in the knowledge that from the moment I staked the
first dollar of the firms money I was a criminalno matter whether
I lost or won You see why it is impossible for me to speak of love
to her

It is a sad thing said Norah after a little pause to think what
very good people there are in the world

Good said Lorison

I was thinking of this superior person whom you say you love She
must be a very poor sort of creature

I do not understand

Nearly she continued as poor a sort of creature as yourself

You do not understand said Lorison removing his hat and sweeping
back his fine light hair Suppose she loved me in return and
were willing to marry me Think if you can what would follow Never
a day would pass but she would be reminded of her sacrifice I would
read a condescension in her smile a pity even in her affection that
would madden me No The thing would stand between us forever Only
equals should mate I could never ask her to come down upon my lower
plane

An arc light faintly shone upon Lorisons face An illumination from
within also pervaded it The girl saw the rapt ascetic look it was
the face either of Sir Galahad or Sir Fool

Quite starlike she said is this unapproachable angel Really too
high to be grasped

By me yes

She faced him suddenly My dear friend would you prefer your star
fallen Lorison made a wide gesture

You push me to the bald fact he declared you are not in sympathy
with my argument But I will answer you so If I could reach my
particular star to drag it down I would not do it but if it were
fallen I would pick it up and thank Heaven for the privilege

They were silent for some minutes Norah shivered and thrust her
hands deep into the pockets of her jacket Lorison uttered a
remorseful exclamation

Im not cold she said I was just thinking I ought to tell you
something You have selected a strange confidante But you cannot
expect a chance acquaintance picked up in a doubtful restaurant to
be an angel

Norah cried Lorison

Let me go on You have told me about yourself We have been such
good friends I must tell you now what I never wanted you to know
I amworse than you are I was on the stage    I sang in the
chorus    I was pretty bad I guess    I stole diamonds from
the prima donna    they arrested me    I gave most of them up
and they let me go    I drank wine every night    a great
deal    I was very wicked but

Lorison knelt quickly by her side and took her hands

Dear Norah he said exultantly It is you it is you I love
You never guessed it did you Tis you I meant all the time Now I
can speak Let me make you forget the past We have both suffered
let us shut out the world and live for each other Norah do you
hear me say I love you

In spite of

Rather say because of it You have come out of your past noble and
good Your heart is an angels Give it to me

A little while ago you feared the future too much to even speak

But for you not for myself Can you love me

She cast herself wildly sobbing upon his breast

Better than lifethan truth itselfthan everything

And my own past said Lorison with a note of solicitudecan you
forgive and

I answered you that she whispered when I told you I loved you
She leaned away and looked thoughtfully at him If I had not told
you about myself would you havewould you

No he interrupted I would never have let you know I loved you I
would never have asked you thisNorah will you be my wife

She wept again

Oh believe me I am good nowI am no longer wicked I will be
the best wife in the world Dont think I ambad any more If you
do I shall die I shall die

While he was consoling her she brightened up eager and impetuous
Will you marry me tonight she said Will you prove it that way
I have a reason for wishing it to be tonight Will you

Of one of two things was this exceeding frankness the outcome either
of importunate brazenness or of utter innocence The lovers
perspective contained only the one

The sooner said Lorison the happier I shall be

What is there to do she asked What do you have to get Come
You should know

Her energy stirred the dreamer to action

A city directory first he cried gayly to find where the man
lives who gives licenses to happiness We will go together and rout
him out Cabs cars policemen telephones and ministers shall aid
us

Father Rogan shall marry us said the girl with ardour I will
take you to him


An hour later the two stood at the open doorway of an immense gloomy
brick building in a narrow and lonely street The license was tight
in Norahs hand

Wait here a moment she said till I find Father Rogan

She plunged into the black hallway and the lover was left standing
as it were on one leg outside His impatience was not greatly
taxed Gazing curiously into what seemed the hallway to Erebus
he was presently reassured by a stream of light that bisected the
darkness far down the passage Then he heard her call and
fluttered lampward like the moth She beckoned him through a
doorway into the room whence emanated the light The room was
bare of nearly everything except books which had subjugated all
its space Here and there little spots of territory had been
reconquered An elderly bald man with a superlatively calm
remote eye stood by a table with a book in his hand his finger
still marking a page His dress was sombre and appertained to a
religious order His eye denoted an acquaintance with the
perspective

Father Rogan said Norah this is _he_

The two of ye said Father Rogan want to get married

They did not deny it He married them The ceremony was quickly
done One who could have witnessed it and felt its scope might have
trembled at the terrible inadequacy of it to rise to the dignity of
its endless chain of results

Afterward the priest spake briefly as if by rote of certain other
civil and legal addenda that either might or should at a later time
cap the ceremony Lorison tendered a fee which was declined and
before the door closed after the departing couple Father Rogans book
popped open again where his finger marked it

In the dark hall Norah whirled and clung to her companion tearful

Will you never never be sorry

At last she was reassured

At the first light they reached upon the street she asked the time
just as she had each night Lorison looked at his watch Halfpast
eight

Lorison thought it was from habit that she guided their steps toward
the corner where they always parted But arrived there she
hesitated and then released his arm A drug store stood on the
corner its bright soft light shone upon them

Please leave me here as usual tonight said Norah sweetly I
mustI would rather you would You will not object At six
tomorrow evening I will meet you at Antonios I want to sit with
you there once more And thenI will go where you say She gave
him a bewildering bright smile and walked swiftly away

Surely it needed all the strength of her charm to carry off this
astounding behaviour It was no discredit to Lorisons strength of
mind that his head began to whirl Pocketing his hands he rambled
vacuously over to the druggists windows and began assiduously to
spell over the names of the patent medicines therein displayed

As soon as be had recovered his wits he proceeded along the street in
an aimless fashion After drifting for two or three squares he
flowed into a somewhat more pretentious thoroughfare a way much
frequented by him in his solitary ramblings For here was a row of
shops devoted to traffic in goods of the widest range of choice
handiworks of art skill and fancy products of nature and labour from
every zone

Here for a time he loitered among the conspicuous windows where was
set emphasized by congested floods of light the cunningest spoil of
the interiors There were few passers and of this Lorison was glad
He was not of the world For a long time he had touched his fellow
man only at the gear of a levelled cogwheelat right angles and
upon a different axis He had dropped into a distinctly new orbit
The stroke of ill fortune had acted upon him in effect as a blow
delivered upon the apex of a certain ingenious toy the musical top
which when thus buffeted while spinning gives forth with scarcely
retarded motion a complete change of key and chord

Strolling along the pacific avenue he experienced singular
supernatural calm accompanied by an unusual a activity of brain
Reflecting upon recent affairs he assured himself of his happiness in
having won for a bride the one he had so greatly desired yet he
wondered mildly at his dearth of active emotion Her strange
behaviour in abandoning him without valid excuse on his bridal eve
aroused in him only a vague and curious speculation Again he found
himself contemplating with complaisant serenity the incidents of her
somewhat lively career His perspective seemed to have been queerly
shifted

As he stood before a window near a corner his ears were assailed by a
waxing clamour and commotion He stood close to the window to allow
passage to the cause of the hubbuba procession of human beings
which rounded the corner and headed in his direction He perceived a
salient hue of blue and a glitter of brass about a central figure of
dazzling white and silver and a ragged wake of black bobbing
figures

Two ponderous policemen were conducting between them a woman dressed
as if for the stage in a short white satiny skirt reaching to the
knees pink stockings and a sort of sleeveless bodice bright with
relucent armourlike scales Upon her curly light hair was perched
at a rollicking angle a shining tin helmet The costume was to be
instantly recognized as one of those amazing conceptions to which
competition has harried the inventors of the spectacular ballet One
of the officers bore a long cloak upon his arm which doubtless had
been intended to veil the I candid attractions of their effulgent
prisoner but for some reason it had not been called into use to
the vociferous delight of the tail of the procession

Compelled by a sudden and vigorous movement of the woman the parade
halted before the window by which Lorison stood He saw that she was
young and at the first glance was deceived by a sophistical
prettiness of her face which waned before a more judicious scrutiny
Her look was bold and reckless and upon her countenance where yet
the contours of youth survived were the fingermarks of old ages
credentialed courier Late Hours

The young woman fixed her unshrinking gaze upon Lorison and called to
him in the voice of the wronged heroine in straits

Say You look like a good fellow come and put up the bail wont
you Ive done nothing to get pinched for Its all a mistake See
how theyre treating me You wont be sorry if youll help me out of
this Think of your sister or your girl being dragged along the
streets this way I say come along now like a good fellow

It may be that Lorison in spite of the unconvincing bathos of this
appeal showed a sympathetic face for one of the officers left the
womans side and went over to him

Its all right Sir he said in a husky confidential tone shes
the right party We took her after the first act at the Green Light
Theatre on a wire from the chief of police of Chicago Its only a
square or two to the station Her rigs pretty bad but she refused
to change clothesor rather added the officer with a smile to
put on some I thought Id explain matters to you so you wouldnt
think she was being imposed upon

What is the charge asked Lorison

Grand larceny Diamonds Her husband is a jeweller in Chicago She
cleaned his show case of the sparklers and skipped with a comicopera
troupe

The policeman perceiving that the interest of the entire group of
spectators was centred upon himself and Lorisontheir conference
being regarded as a possible new complicationwas fain to prolong
the situationwhich reflected his own importanceby a little
afterpiece of philosophical comment

A gentleman like you Sir he went on affably would never notice
it but it comes in my line to observe what an immense amount of
trouble is made by that combinationI mean the stage diamonds
and lightheaded women who arent satisfied with good homes I tell
you Sir a man these days and nights wants to know what his women
folks are up to

The policeman smiled a good night and returned to the side of his
charge who had been intently watching Lorisons face during the
conversation no doubt for some indication of his intention to render
succour Now at the failure of the sign and at the movement made to
continue the ignominious progress she abandoned hope and addressed
him thus pointedly

You damn chalkfaced quitter You was thinking of giving me a hand
but you let the cop talk you out of it the first word Youre a dandy
to tie to Say if you ever get a girl shell have a picnic Wont
she work you to the queens taste Oh my She concluded with a
taunting shrill laugh that rasped Lorison like a saw The policemen
urged her forward the delighted train of gaping followers closed up
the rear and the captive Amazon accepting her fate extended the
scope of her maledictions so that none in hearing might seem to be
slighted

Then there came upon Lorison an overwhelming revulsion of his
perspective It may be that he had been ripe for it that the
abnormal condition of mind in which he had for so long existed was
already about to revert to its balance however it is certain that
the events of the last few minutes had furnished the channel if not
the impetus for the change

The initial determining influence had been so small a thing as the
fact and manner of his having been approached by the officer That
agent had by the style of his accost restored the loiterer to his
former place in society In an instant he had been transformed from a
somewhat rancid prowler along the fishy side streets of gentility into
an honest gentleman with whom even so lordly a guardian of the peace
might agreeably exchange the compliments

This then first broke the spell and set thrilling in him a
resurrected longing for the fellowship of his kind and the rewards of
the virtuous To what end he vehemently asked himself was this
fanciful selfaccusation this empty renunciation this moral
squeamishness through which he had been led to abandon what was his
heritage in life and not beyond his deserts Technically he was
uncondemned his sole guilty spot was in thought rather than deed and
cognizance of it unshared by others For what good moral or
sentimental did he slink retreating like the hedgehog from his own
shadow to and fro in this musty Bohemia that lacked even the
picturesque

But the thing that struck home and set him raging was the part played
by the Amazonian prisoner To the counterpart of that astounding
belligerentidentical at least in the way of experienceto one
by her own confession thus far fallen had he not three hours since
been united in marriage How desirable and natural it had seemed to
him then and how monstrous it seemed now How the words of diamond
thief number two yet burned in his ears If you ever get a girl
shell have a picnic What did that mean but that women instinctively
knew him for one they could hoodwink Still again there reverberated
the policemans sapient contribution to his agony A man these days
and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to Oh yes he
had been a fool he had looked at things from the wrong standpoint

But the wildest note in all the clamour was struck by pains
forefinger jealousy Now at least he felt that keenest stinga
mounting love unworthily bestowed Whatever she might be he loved
her he bore in his own breast his doom A grating comic flavour to
his predicament struck him suddenly and he laughed creakingly as he
swung down the echoing pavement An impetuous desire to act to
battle with his fate seized him He stopped upon his heel and smote
his palms together triumphantly His wife waswhere But there
was a tangible link an outlet more or less navigable through which
his derelict ship of matrimony might yet be safely towedthe
priest

Like all imaginative men with pliable natures Lorison was when
thoroughly stirred apt to become tempestuous With a high and
stubborn indignation upon him be retraced his steps to the
intersecting street by which he had come Down this he hurried to the
corner where he had parted withan astringent grimace tinctured the
thoughthis wife Thence still back he harked following through
an unfamiliar district his stimulated recollections of the way they
had come from that preposterous wedding Many times he went abroad
and nosed his way back to the trail furious

At last when he reached the dark calamitous building in which his
madness had culminated and found the black hallway he dashed down
it perceiving no light or sound But he raised his voice hailing
loudly reckless of everything but that he should find the old
mischiefmaker with the eyes that looked too far away to see the
disaster he had wrought The door opened and in the stream of light
Father Rogan stood his book in hand with his finger marking the
place

Ah cried Lorison You are the man I want I had a wife of you a
few hours ago I would not trouble you but I neglected to note how
it was done Will you oblige me with the information whether the
business is beyond remedy

Come inside said the priest there are other lodgers in the
house who might prefer sleep to even a gratified curiosity

Lorison entered the room and took the chair offered him The priests
eyes looked a courteous interrogation

I must apologize again said the young man for so soon intruding
upon you with my marital infelicities but as my wife has neglected
to furnish me with her address I am deprived of the legitimate
recourse of a family row

I am quite a plain man said Father Rogan pleasantly but I do
not see how I am to ask you questions

Pardon my indirectness said Lorison I will ask one In this room
tonight you pronounced me to be a husband You afterward spoke of
additional rites or performances that either should or could be
effected I paid little attention to your words then but I am hungry
to hear them repeated now As matters stand am I married past all
help

You are as legally and as firmly bound said the priest as though
it had been done in a cathedral in the presence of thousands The
additional observances I referred to are not necessary to the
strictest legality of the act but were advised as a precaution for
the futurefor convenience of proof in such contingencies as wills
inheritances and the like

Lorison laughed harshly

Many thanks he said Then there is no mistake and I am the happy
benedict I suppose I should go stand upon the bridal corner and
when my wife gets through walking the streets she will look me up

Father Rogan regarded him calmly

My son he said when a man and woman come to me to be married I
always marry them I do this for the sake of other people whom they
might go away and marry if they did not marry each other As you see
I do not seek your confidence but your case seems to me to be one not
altogether devoid of interest Very few marriages that have come to
my notice have brought such wellexpressed regret within so short a
time I will hazard one question were you not under the impression
that you loved the lady you married at the time you did so

Loved her cried Lorison wildly Never so well as now though
she told me she deceived and sinned and stole Never more than now
when perhaps she is laughing at the fool she cajoled and left with
scarcely a word to return to God only knows what particular line of
her former folly

Father Rogan answered nothing During the silence that succeeded he
sat with a quiet expectation beaming in his full lambent eye

If you would listen began Lorison The priest held up his hand

As I hoped he said I thought you would trust me Wait but a
moment He brought a long clay pipe filled and lighted it

Now my son he said

Lorison poured a twelve months accumulated confidence into Father
Rogans ear He told all not sparing himself or omitting the facts
of his past the events of the night or his disturbing conjectures
and fears

The main point said the priest when he had concluded seems to
me to be thisare you reasonably sure that you love this woman whom
you have married

Why exclaimed Lorison rising impulsively to his feetwhy
should I deny it But look at meam fish flesh or fowl That is
the main point to me I assure you

I understand you said the priest also rising and laying down his
pipe The situation is one that has taxed the endurance of much
older men than youin fact especially much older men than you I
will try to relieve you from it and this night You shall see for
yourself into exactly what predicament you have fallen and how you
shall possibly be extricated There is no evidence so credible as
that of the eyesight

Father Rogan moved about the room and donned a soft black hat
Buttoning his coat to his throat he laid his hand on the doorknob
Let us walk he said

The two went out upon the street The priest turned his face down it
and Lorison walked with him through a squalid district where the
houses loomed awry and desolatelooking high above them Presently
they turned into a less dismal side street where the houses were
smaller and though hinting of the most meagre comfort lacked the
concentrated wretchedness of the more populous byways

At a segregated twostory house Father Rogan halted and mounted the
steps with the confidence of a familiar visitor He ushered Lorison
into a narrow hallway faintly lighted by a cobwebbed hanging lamp
Almost immediately a door to the right opened and a dingy Irishwoman
protruded her head

Good evening to ye Mistress Geehan said the priest unconsciously
it seemed falling into a delicately flavoured brogue And is it
yourself can tell me if Norah has gone out again the night maybe

Oh its yer blissid riverence Sure and I can tell ye the same
The purty darlin wint out as usual but a bit later And she says
Mother Geehan says she its me last noight out praise the
saints this noight is And oh yer riverence the swate beautiful
drame of a dress she had this toime White satin and silk and
ribbons and lace about the neck and arrumstwas a sin yer
reverence the gold was spint upon it

The priest heard Lorison catch his breath painfully and a faint smile
flickered across his own cleancut mouth

Well then Mistress Geehan said he Ill just step upstairs and
see the bit boy for a minute and Ill take this gentleman up with
me

Hes awake thin said the woman Ive just come down from sitting
wid him the last hour tilling him fine shtories of ould County
Tyrone Tis a greedy gossoon it is yer riverence for me
shtories

Small the doubt said Father Rogan Theres no rocking would put
him to slape the quicker Im thinking

Amid the womans shrill protest against the retort the two men
ascended the steep stairway The priest pushed open the door of a
room near its top

Is that you already sister drawled a sweet childish voice from
the darkness

Its only ould Father Denny come to see ye darlin and a foine
gentleman Ive brought to make ye a grrand call And ye resaves us
fast aslape in bed Shame on yez manners

Oh Father Denny is that you Im glad And will you light the
lamp please Its on the table by the door And quit talking like
Mother Geehan Father Denny

The priest lit the lamp and Lorison saw a tiny towsledhaired boy
with a thin delicate face sitting up in a small bed in a corner
Quickly also his rapid glance considered the room and its
contents It was furnished with more than comfort and its adornments
plainly indicated a womans discerning taste An open door beyond
revealed the blackness of an adjoining rooms interior

The boy clutched both of Father Rogans hands Im so glad you
came he said but why did you come in the night Did sister send
you

Off wid ye Am I to be sint about at me age as was Terence
McShane of Ballymahone I come on me own rrresponsibility

Lorison had also advanced to the boys bedside He was fond of
children and the wee fellow laying himself down to sleep alone in
that dark room stirredhis heart

Arent you afraid little man he asked stooping down beside him

Sometimes answered the boy with a shy smile when the rats make
too much noise But nearly every night when sister goes out Mother
Geehan stays a while with me and tells me funny stories Im not
often afraid sir

This brave little gentleman said Father Rogan is a scholar of
mine Every day from halfpast six to halfpast eightwhen sister
comes for himhe stops in my study and we find out whats in the
inside of books He knows multiplication division and fractions and
hes troubling me to begin wid the chronicles of Ciaran of
Clonmacnoise Corurac McCullenan and Cuan OLochain the grrreat
Irish histhorians The boy was evidently accustomed to the priests
Celtic pleasantries A little appreciative grin was all the attention
the insinuation of pedantry received

Lorison to have saved his life could not have put to the child one
of those vital questions that were wildly beating about unanswered
in his own brain The little fellow was very like Norah he had the
same shining hair and candid eyes

Oh Father Denny cried the boy suddenly I forgot to tell you
Sister is not going away at night any more She told me so when she
kissed me good night as she was leaving And she said she was so
happy and then she cried Wasnt that queer But Im glad arent
you

Yes lad And now ye omadhaun go to sleep and say good night we
must be going

Which shall I do first Father Denny

Faith hes caught me again Wait till I get the sassenach into the
annals of Tageruach the hagiographer Ill give him enough of the
Irish idiom to make him more respectful

The light was out and the small brave voice bidding them good night
from the dark room They groped downstairs and tore away from the
garrulity of Mother Geehan

Again the priest steered them through the dim ways but this time in
another direction His conductor was serenely silent and Lorison
followed his example to the extent of seldom speaking Serene he
could not be His heart beat suffocatingly in his breast The
following of this blind menacing trail was pregnant with he knew not
what humiliating revelation to be delivered at its end

They came into a more pretentious street where trade it could be
surmised flourished by day And again the priest paused this time
before a lofty building whose great doors and windows in the lowest
floor were carefully shuttered and barred Its higher apertures were
dark save in the third story the windows of which were brilliantly
lighted Lorisons ear caught a distant regular pleasing thrumming
as of music above They stood at an angle of the building Up along
the side nearest them mounted an iron stairway At its top was an
upright illuminated parallelogram Father Rogan had stopped and
stood musing

I will say this much he remarked thoughtfully I believe you to
be a better man than you think yourself to be and a better man than I
thought some hours ago But do not take this he added with a smile
as much praise I promised you a possible deliverance from an
unhappy perplexity I will have to modify that promise I can only
remove the mystery that enhanced that perplexity Your deliverance
depends upon yourself Come

He led his companion up the stairway Halfway up Lorison caught him
by the sleeve Remember he gasped I love that woman

You desired to know

IGo on

The priest reached the landing at the top of the stairway Lorison
behind him saw that the illuminated space was the glass upper half of
a door opening into the lighted room The rhythmic music increased as
they neared it the stairs shook with the mellow vibrations

Lorison stopped breathing when he set foot upon the highest step for
the priest stood aside and motioned him to look through the glass of
the door

His eye accustomed to the darkness met first a blinding glare
and then he made out the faces and forms of many people amid
an extravagant display of splendid robingsbillowy laces
brillianthued finery ribbons silks and misty drapery And then
he caught the meaning of that jarring hum and he saw the tired
pale happy face of his wife bending as were a score of others
over her sewing machinetoiling toiling Here was the folly she
pursued and the end of his quest

But not his deliverance though even then remorse struck him His
shamed soul fluttered once more before it retired to make room for the
other and better one For to temper his thrill of joy the shine of
the satin and the glimmer of ornaments recalled the disturbing figure
of the bespangled Amazon and the base duplicate histories lit by the
glare of footlights and stolen diamonds It is past the wisdom of him
who only sets the scenes either to praise or blame the man But this
time his love overcame his scruples He took a quick step and
reached out his hand for the doorknob Father Rogan was quicker to
arrest it and draw him back

You use my trust in you queerly said the priest sternly What are
you about to do

I am going to my wife said Lorison Let me pass

Listen said the priest holding him firmly by the arm I am about
to put you in possession of a piece of knowledge of which thus far
you have scarcely proved deserving I do not think you ever will but
I will not dwell upon that You see in that room the woman you
married working for a frugal living for herself and a generous
comfort for an idolized brother This building belongs to the chief
costumer of the city For months the advance orders for the coming
Mardi Gras festivals have kept the work going day and night I myself
secured employment here for Norah She toils here each night from
nine oclock until daylight and besides carries home with her some
of the finer costumes requiring more delicate needlework and works
there part of the day Somehow you two have remained strangely
ignorant of each others lives Are you convinced now that your wife
is not walking the streets

Let me go to her cried Lorison again struggling and beg her
forgiveness

Sir said the priest do you owe me nothing Be quiet It seems
so often that Heaven lets fall its choicest gifts into hands that must
be taught to hold them Listen again You forgot that repentant sin
must not compromise but look up for redemption to the purest and
best You went to her with the finespun sophistry that peace could be
found in a mutual guilt and she fearful of losing what her heart so
craved thought it worth the price to buy it with a desperate pure
beautiful lie I have known her since the day she was born she is as
innocent and unsullied in life and deed as a holy saint In that
lowly street where she dwells she first saw the light and she has
lived there ever since spending her days in generous selfsacrifice
for others Och ye spalpeen continued Father Rogan raising his
finger in kindly anger at Lorison What for I wonder could she be
after making a fool of hersilf and shamin her swate soul with lies
for the like of you

Sir said Lorison trembling say what you please of me Doubt it
as you must I will yet prove my gratitude to you and my devotion to
her But let me speak to her once now let me kneel for just one
moment at her feet and

Tut tut said the priest How many acts of a love drama do you
think an old bookworm like me capable of witnessing Besides what
kind of figures do we cut spying upon the mysteries of midnight
millinery Go to meet your wife tomorrow as she ordered you and
obey her thereafter and maybe some time I shall get forgiveness for
the part I have played in this nights work Off wid yez down the
shtairs now Tis late and an ould man like me should be takin his
rest

MADAME BOPEEP OF THE RANCHES


Aunt Ellen said Octavia cheerfully as she threw her black kid
gloves carefully at the dignified Persian cat on the windowseat Im
a pauper

You are so extreme in your statements Octavia dear said Aunt
Ellen mildly looking up from her paper If you find yourself
temporarily in need of some small change for bonbons you will find
my purse in the drawer of the writing desk

Octavia Beaupree removed her hat and seated herself on a footstool
near her aunts chair clasping her hands about her knees Her slim
and flexible figure clad in a modish mourning costume accommodated
itself easily and gracefully to the trying position Her bright and
youthful face with its pair of sparkling lifeenamoured eyes tried
to compose itself to the seriousness that the occasion seemed to
demand

You good auntie it isnt a case of bonbons it is abject staring
unpicturesque poverty with readymade clothes gasolined gloves and
probably one oclock dinners all waiting with the traditional wolf at
the door Ive just come from my lawyer auntie and Please maam
I aint got nothink t all Flowers lady Buttonhole gentleman
Pencils sir three for five to help a poor widow Do I do it
nicely auntie or as a breadwinner accomplishment were my lessons
in elocution entirely wasted

Do be serious my dear said Aunt Ellen letting her paper fall to
the floor long enough to tell me what you mean Colonel Beauprees
estate

Colonel Beauprees estate interrupted Octavia emphasizing her
words with appropriate dramatic gestures is of Spanish castellar
architecture Colonel Beauprees resources arewind Colonel
Beauprees stocks arewater Colonel Beauprees income isall
in The statement lacks the legal technicalities to which I have been
listening for an hour but that is what it means when translated

Octavia Aunt Ellen was now visibly possessed by consternation I
can hardly believe it And it was the impression that he was worth a
million And the De Peysters themselves introduced him

Octavia rippled out a laugh and then became properly grave

_De mortuis nil_ auntienot even the rest of it The dear old
colonelwhat a gold brick he was after all I paid for my bargain
fairlyIm all here am I notitems eyes fingers toes
youth old family unquestionable position in society as called for
in the contractno wildcat stock here Octavia picked up the morning
paper from the floor But Im not going to squealisnt that
what they call it when you rail at Fortune because youve lost the
game She turned the pages of the paper calmly Stock marketno
use for that Societys doingsthats done Here is my pagethe
wish column A Van Dresser could not be said to want for anything
of course Chambermaids cooks canvassers stenographers

Dear said Aunt Ellen with a little tremor in her voice please do
not talk in that way Even if your affairs are in so unfortunate a
condition there is my three thousand

Octavia sprang up lithely and deposited a smart kiss on the delicate
cheek of the prim little elderly maid

Blessed auntie your three thousand is just sufficient to insure your
Hyson to be free from willow leaves and keep the Persian in sterilized
cream I know Id be welcome but I prefer to strike bottom like
Beelzebub rather than hang around like the Peri listening to the music
from the side entrance Im going to earn my own living Theres
nothing else to do Im aOh oh ohI had forgotten Theres
one thing saved from the wreck Its a corralno a ranch inlet
me seeTexas an asset dear old Mr Bannister called it How
pleased he was to show me something he could describe as unencumbered
Ive a description of it among those stupid papers he made me bring
away with me from his office Ill try to find it

Octavia found her shoppingbag and drew from it a long envelope
filled with typewritten documents

A ranch in Texas sighed Aunt Ellen It sounds to me more like a
liability than an asset Those are the places where the centipedes are
found and cowboys and fandangos

The Rancho de las Sombras read Octavia from a sheet of violently
purple typewriting is situated one hundred and ten miles southeast
of San Antonio and thirtyeight miles from its nearest railroad
station Nopal on the I and G N Ranch consists of 7680 acres
of wellwatered land with title conferred by State patents and
twentytwo sections or 14080 acres partly under yearly running
lease and partly bought under States twentyyearpurchase act Eight
thousand graded merino sheep with the necessary equipment of horses
vehicles and general ranch paraphernalia Ranchhouse built of brick
with six rooms comfortably furnished according to the requirements of
the climate All within a strong barbedwire fence

The present ranch manager seems to be competent and reliable and is
rapidly placing upon a paying basis a business that in other hands
had been allowed to suffer from neglect and misconduct

This property was secured by Colonel Beaupree in a deal with a
Western irrigation syndicate and the title to it seems to be perfect
With careful management and the natural increase of land values it
ought to be made the foundation for a comfortable fortune for its
owner

When Octavia ceased reading Aunt Ellen uttered something as near a
sniff as her breeding permitted

The prospectus she said with uncompromising metropolitan
suspicion doesnt mention the centipedes or the Indians And you
never did like mutton Octavia I dont see what advantage you can
derive from thisdesert

But Octavia was in a trance Her eyes were steadily regarding
something quite beyond their focus Her lips were parted and her face
was lighted by the kindling furor of the explorer the ardent
stirring disquiet of the adventurer Suddenly she clasped her hands
together exultantly

The problem solves itself auntie she cried Im going to that
ranch Im going to live on it Im going to learn to like mutton
and even concede the good qualities of centipedesat a respectful
distance Its just what I need Its a new life that comes when my
old one is just ending Its a release auntie it isnt a narrowing
Think of the gallops over those leagues of prairies with the wind
tugging at the roots of your hair the coming close to the earth
and learning over again the stories of the growing grass and the
little wild flowers without names Glorious is what it will be Shall
I be a shepherdess with a Watteau hat and a crook to keep the bad
wolves from the lambs or a typical Western ranch girl with short
hair like the pictures of her in the Sunday papers I think the
latter And theyll have my picture too with the wildcats Ive
slain singlehanded hanging from my saddle horn From the Four
Hundred to the Flocks is the way theyll headline it and theyll
print photographs of the old Van Dresser mansion and the church where
I was married They wont have my picture but theyll get an artist
to draw it Ill be wild and woolly and Ill grow my own wool

Octavia Aunt Ellen condensed into the one word all the protests
she was unable to utter

Dont say a word auntie Im going Ill see the sky at night fit
down on the world like a big butterdish cover and Ill make friends
again with the stars that I havent had a chat with since I was a wee
child I wish to go Im tired of all this Im glad I havent any
money I could bless Colonel Beaupree for that ranch and forgive him
for all his bubbles What if the life will be rough and lonely II
deserve it I shut my heart to everything except that miserable
ambition Ioh I wish to go away and forgetforget

Octavia swerved suddenly to her knees laid her flushed face in her
aunts lap and shook with turbulent sobs

Aunt Ellen bent over her and smoothed the copperybrown hair

I didnt know she said gently I didnt knowthat Who was it
dear


When Mrs Octavia Beaupree nee Van Dresser stepped from the train at
Nopal her manner lost for the moment some of that easy certitude
which had always marked her movements The town was of recent
establishment and seemed to have been hastily constructed of undressed
lumber and flapping canvas The element that had congregated about the
station though not offensively demonstrative was clearly composed of
citizens accustomed to and prepared for rude alarms

Octavia stood on the platform against the telegraph office and
attempted to choose by intuition from the swaggering straggling
string of loungers the manager of the Rancho de las Sombras who
had been instructed by Mr Bannister to meet her there That tall
serious looking elderly man in the blue flannel shirt and white tie
she thought must be he But no he passed by removing his gaze from
the lady as hers rested on him according to the Southern custom The
manager she thought with some impatience at being kept waiting
should have no difficulty in selecting her Young women wearing the
most recent thing in ashcoloured travelling suits were not so
plentiful in Nopal

Thus keeping a speculative watch on all persons of possible managerial
aspect Octavia with a catching breath and a start of surprise
suddenly became aware of Teddy Westlake hurrying along the platform in
the direction of the trainof Teddy Westlake or his sunbrowned
ghost in cheviot boots and leathergirdled hatTheodore Westlake
Jr amateur polo almost champion allround butterfly and cumberer
of the soil but a broader surer more emphasized and determined
Teddy than the one she had known a year ago when last she saw him

He perceived Octavia at almost the same time deflected his course
and steered for her in his old straightforward way Something like
awe came upon her as the strangeness of his metamorphosis was
brought into closer range the rich redbrown of his complexion
brought out so vividly his strawcoloured mustache and steelgray
eyes He seemed more grownup and somehow farther away But when
he spoke the old boyish Teddy came back again They had been friends
from childhood

Why Tave he exclaimed unable to reduce his perplexity to
coherence Howwhatwhenwhere

Train said Octavia necessity ten minutes ago home Your
complexions gone Teddy Now howwhatwhenwhere

Im working down here said Teddy He cast side glances about the
station as one does who tries to combine politeness with duty

You didnt notice on the train he asked an old lady with gray
curls and a poodle who occupied two seats with her bundles and
quarrelled with the conductor did you

I think not answered Octavia reflecting And you havent by
any chance noticed a big graymustached man in a blue shirt and
sixshooters with little flakes of merino wool sticking in his hair
have you

Lots of em said Teddy with symptoms of mental delirium under the
strain Do you happen to know any such individual

No the description is imaginary Is your interest in the old lady
whom you describe a personal one

Never saw her in my life Shes painted entirely from fancy She owns
the little piece of property where I earn my bread and butterthe
Rancho de las Sombras I drove up to meet her according to arrangement
with her lawyer

Octavia leaned against the wall of the telegraph office Was this
possible And didnt he know

Are you the manager of that ranch she asked weakly

I am said Teddy with pride

I am Mrs Beaupree said Octavia faintly but my hair never would
curl and I was polite to the conductor

For a moment that strange grownup look came back and removed Teddy
miles away from her

I hope youll excuse me he said rather awkwardly You see Ive
been down here in the chaparral a year I hadnt heard Give me your
checks please and Ill have your traps loaded into the wagon Jose
will follow with them We travel ahead in the buckboard

Seated by Teddy in a featherweight buckboard behind a pair of wild
creamcoloured Spanish ponies Octavia abandoned all thought for the
exhilaration of the present They swept out of the little town and
down the level road toward the south Soon the road dwindled and
disappeared and they struck across a world carpeted with an endless
reach of curly mesquite grass The wheels made no sound The tireless
ponies bounded ahead at an unbroken gallop The temperate wind made
fragrant by thousands of acres of blue and yellow wild flowers roared
gloriously in their ears The motion was aerial ecstatic with a
thrilling sense of perpetuity in its effect Octavia sat silent
possessed by a feeling of elemental sensual bliss Teddy seemed to be
wrestling with some internal problem

Im going to call you madama he announced as the result of his
labours That is what the Mexicans will call youtheyre nearly
all Mexicans on the ranch you know That seems to me about the proper
thing

Very well Mr Westlake said Octavia primly

Oh now said Teddy in some consternation thats carrying the
thing too far isnt it

Dont worry me with your beastly etiquette Im just beginning to
live Dont remind me of anything artificial If only this air could
be bottled This much alone is worth coming for Oh look I there goes
a deer

Jackrabbit said Teddy without turning his head

Could Imight I drive suggested Octavia panting with rosetinted
cheeks and the eye of an eager child

On one condition Could Imight I smoke

Forever cried Octavia taking the lines with solemn joy How shall
I know which way to drive

Keep her sou by soueast and all sail set You see that black speck
on the horizon under that lowermost Gulf cloud Thats a group of
liveoaks and a landmark Steer halfway between that and the little
hill to the left Ill recite you the whole code of driving rules for
the Texas prairies keep the reins from under the horses feet and
swear at em frequent

Im too happy to swear Ted Oh why do people buy yachts or travel
in palacecars when a buckboard and a pair of plugs and a spring
morning like this can satisfy all desire

Now Ill ask you protested Teddy who was futilely striking match
after match on the dashboard not to call those denizens of the air
plugs They can kick out a hundred miles between daylight and dark
At last he succeeded in snatching a light for his cigar from the flame
held in the hollow of his hands

Room said Octavia intensely Thats what produces the effect I
know now what Ive wantedscoperangeroom

Smokingroom said Teddy unsentimentally I love to smoke in a
buckboard The wind blows the smoke into you and out again It saves
exertion

The two fell so naturally into their oldtime goodfellowship that it
was only by degrees that a sense of the strangeness of the new
relations between them came to be felt

Madama said Teddy wonderingly however did you get it into your
bead to cut the crowd and come down here Is it a fad now among the
upper classes to trot off to sheep ranches instead of to Newport

I was broke Teddy said Octavia sweetly with her interest centred
upon steering safely between a Spanish dagger plant and a clump of
chaparral I havent a thing in the world but this ranchnot even
any other home to go to

Come now said Teddy anxiously but incredulously you dont
mean it

When my husband said Octavia with a shy slurring of the word
died three months ago I thought I had a reasonable amount of the
worlds goods His lawyer exploded that theory in a sixtyminute fully
illustrated lecture I took to the sheep as a last resort Do you
happen to know of any fashionable caprice among the gilded youth of
Manhattan that induces them to abandon polo and club windows to become
managers of sheep ranches

Its easily explained in my case responded Teddy promptly I
had to go to work I couldnt have earned my board in New York so I
chummed a while with old Sandford one of the syndicate that owned the
ranch before Colonel Beaupree bought it and got a place down here I
wasnt manager at first I jogged around on ponies and studied the
business in detail until I got all the points in my head I saw where
it was losing and what the remedies were and then Sandford put me
in charge I get a hundred dollars a month and I earn it

Poor Teddy said Octavia with a smile

You neednt I like it I save half my wages and Im as hard as a
water plug It beats polo

Will it furnish bread and tea and jam for another outcast from
civilization

The spring shearing said the manager just cleaned up a deficit in
last years business Wastefulness and inattention have been the rule
heretofore The autumn clip will leave a small profit over all
expenses Next year there will be jam

When about four oclock in the afternoon the ponies rounded a
gentle brushcovered hill and then swooped like a double
creamcoloured cyclone upon the Rancho de las Sombras Octavia gave
a little cry of delight A lordly grove of magnificent liveoaks cast
an area of grateful cool shade whence the ranch had drawn its name
de las Sombrasof the shadows The house of red brick one story
ran low and long beneath the trees Through its middle dividing its
six rooms in half extended a broad arched passageway picturesque
with flowering cactus and hanging red earthern jars A gallery low
and broad encircled the building Vines climbed about it and the
adjacent ground was for a space covered with transplanted grass and
shrubs A little lake long and narrow glimmered in the sun at the
rear Further away stood the shacks of the Mexican workers the
corrals wool sheds and shearing pens To the right lay the low hills
splattered with dark patches of chaparral to the left the unbounded
green prairie blending against the blue heavens

Its a home Teddy said Octavia breathlessly thats what it
isits a home

Not so bad for a sheep ranch admitted Teddy with excusable pride
Ive been tinkering on it at odd times

A Mexican youth sprang from somewhere in the grass and took charge of
the creams The mistress and the manager entered the house

Heres Mrs MacIntyre said Teddy as a placid neat elderly lady
came out upon the gallery to meet them Mrs Mac heres the boss
Very likely she will be wanting a hunk of ham and a dish of beans
after her drive

Mrs MacIntyre the housekeeper as much a fixture on the place as the
lake or the liveoaks received the imputation of the ranchs
resources of refreshment with mild indignation and was about to give
it utterance when Octavia spoke

Oh Mrs MacIntyre dont apologize for Teddy Yes I call him Teddy
So does every one whom he hasnt duped into taking him seriously You
see we used to cut paper dolls and play jackstraws together ages ago
No one minds what he says

No said Teddy no one minds what he says just so he doesnt do it
again

Octavia cast one of those subtle sidelong glances toward him from
beneath her lowered eyelidsa glance that Teddy used to describe as
an uppercut But there was nothing in his ingenuous weathertanned
face to warrant a suspicion that he was making an allusionnothing
Beyond a doubt thought Octavia he had forgotten

Mr Westlake likes his fun said Mrs Maclntyre as she conducted
Octavia to her rooms But she added loyally people around here
usually pay attention to what he says when he talks in earnest I
dont know what would have become of this place without him

Two rooms at the east end of the house had been arranged for the
occupancy of the ranchs mistress When she entered them a slight
dismay seized her at their bare appearance and the scantiness of
their furniture but she quickly reflected that the climate was a
semitropical one and was moved to appreciation of the wellconceived
efforts to conform to it The sashes had already been removed from the
big windows and white curtains waved in the Gulf breeze that streamed
through the wide jalousies The bare floor was amply strewn with cool
rugs the chairs were inviting deep dreamy willows the walls were
papered with a light cheerful olive One whole side of her sitting
room was covered with books on smooth unpainted pine shelves She
flew to these at once Before her was a wellselected library She
caught glimpses of titles of volumes of fiction and travel not yet
seasoned from the dampness of the press

Presently recollecting that she was now in a wilderness given over to
mutton centipedes and privations the incongruity of these luxuries
struck her and with intuitive feminine suspicion she began turning
to the flyleaves of volume after volume Upon each one was inscribed
in fluent characters the name of Theodore Westlake Jr

Octavia fatigued by her long journey retired early that night Lying
upon her white cool bed she rested deliciously but sleep coquetted
long with her She listened to faint noises whose strangeness kept her
faculties on the alertthe fractious yelping of the coyotes the
ceaseless low symphony of the wind the distant booming of the frogs
about the lake the lamentation of a concertina in the Mexicans
quarters There were many conflicting feelings in her heart
thankfulness and rebellion peace and disquietude loneliness and a
sense of protecting care happiness and an old haunting pain

She did what any other woman would have donesought relief in a
wholesome tide of unreasonable tears and her last words murmured to
herself before slumber capitulating came softly to woo her were He
has forgotten

The manager of the Rancho de las Sombras was no dilettante He was a
hustler He was generally up mounted and away of mornings before
the rest of the household were awake making the rounds of the flocks
and camps This was the duty of the majordomo a stately old Mexican
with a princely air and manner but Teddy seemed to have a great deal
of confidence in his own eyesight Except in the busy seasons he
nearly always returned to the ranch to breakfast at eight oclock
with Octavia and Mrs Maclntyre at the little table set in the
central hallway bringing with him a tonic and breezy cheerfulness
full of the health and flavour of the prairies

A few days after Octavias arrival he made her get out one of her
riding skirts and curtail it to a shortness demanded by the chaparral
brakes

With some misgivings she donned this and the pair of buckskin leggings
he prescribed in addition and mounted upon a dancing pony rode with
him to view her possessions He showed her everythingthe flocks
of ewes muttons and grazing lambs the dipping vats the shearing
pens the uncouth merino rams in their little pasture the watertanks
prepared against the summer droughtgiving account of his stewardship
with a boyish enthusiasm that never flagged

Where was the old Teddy that she knew so well This side of him was
the same and it was a side that pleased her but this was all she
ever saw of him now Where was his sentimentalitythose old
varying moods of impetuous lovemaking of fanciful quixotic
devotion of heartbreaking gloom of alternating absurd tenderness
and haughty dignity His nature had been a sensitive one his
temperament bordering closely on the artistic She knew that besides
being a follower of fashion and its fads and sports he had cultivated
tastes of a finer nature He had written things he had tampered with
colours he was something of a student in certain branches of art and
once she had been admitted to all his aspirations and thoughts But
nowand she could not avoid the conclusionTeddy had barricaded
against her every side of himself except onethe side that showed the
manager of the Rancho de las Sombras and a jolly chum who had forgiven
and forgotten Queerly enough the words of Mr Bannisters description
of her property came into her mindall inclosed within a strong
barbedwire fence

Teddys fenced too said Octavia to herself

It was not difficult for her to reason out the cause of his
fortifications It had originated one night at the Hammersmiths ball
It occurred at a time soon after she had decided to accept Colonel
Beaupree and his million which was no more than her looks and the
entree she held to the inner circles were worth Teddy had proposed
with all his impetuosity and fire and she looked him straight in the
eyes an said coldly and finally Never let me hear any such silly
nonsense from you again You wont said Teddy with an expression
around his mouth andnow Teddy was inclosed within a strong
barbedwire fence

It was on this first ride of inspection that Teddy was seized by the
inspiration that suggested the name of Mother Gooses heroine and he
at once bestowed it upon Octavia The idea supported by both a
similarity of names and identity of occupations seemed to strike him
as a peculiarly happy one and he never tired of using it The
Mexicans on the ranch also took up the name adding another syllable
to accommodate their lingual incapacity for the final p gravely
referring to her as La Madama BoPeepy Eventually it spread and
Madame BoPeeps ranch was as often mentioned as the Rancho de las
Sombras

Came the long hot season from May to September when work is scarce
on the ranches Octavia passed the days in a kind of lotuseaters
dream Books hammocks correspondence with a few intimate friends a
renewed interest in her old watercolour box and easelthese
disposed of the sultry hours of daylight The evenings were always
sure to bring enjoyment Best of all were the rapturous horseback
rides with Teddy when the moon gave light over the windswept
leagues chaperoned by the wheeling nighthawk and the startled owl
Often the Mexicans would come up from their shacks with their guitars
and sing the weirdest of heartbreaking songs There were long cosy
chats on the breezy gallery and an interminable warfare of wits
between Teddy and Mrs MacIntyre whose abundant Scotch shrewdness
often more than overmatched the lighter humour in which she was
lacking

And the nights came one after another and were filed away by weeks
and monthsnights soft and languorous and fragrant that should
have driven Strephon to Chloe over wires however barbed that might
have drawn Cupid himself to hunt lasso in hand among those amorous
pasturesbut Teddy kept his fences up

One July night Madame BoPeep and her ranch manager were sitting on
the east gallery Teddy had been exhausting the science of
prognostication as to the probabilities of a price of twentyfour
cents for the autumn clip and had then subsided into an anesthetic
cloud of Havana smoke Only as incompetent a judge as a woman would
have failed to note long ago that at least a third of his salary must
have gone up in the fumes of those imported Regalias

Teddy said Octavia suddenly and rather sharply what are you
working down here on a ranch for

One hundred per said Teddy glibly and found

Ive a good mind to discharge you

Cant do it said Teddy with a grin

Why not demanded Octavia with argumentative heat

Under contract Terms of sale respect all unexpired contracts Mine
runs until 12 P M December thirtyfirst You might get up at
midnight on that date and fire me If you try it sooner Ill be in a
position to bring legal proceedings

Octavia seemed to be considering the prospects of litigation

But continued Teddy cheerfully Ive been thinking of resigning
anyway

Octavias rockingchair ceased its motion There were centipedes in
this country she felt sure and Indians and vast lonely desolate
empty wastes all within strong barbedwire fence There was a Van
Dresser pride but there was also a Van Dresser heart She must know
for certain whether or not he had forgotten

Ah well Teddy she said with a fine assumption of polite
interest its lonely down here youre longing to get back to the
old lifeto polo and lobsters and theatres and balls

Never cared much for balls said Teddy virtuously

Youre getting old Teddy Your memory is failing Nobody ever knew
you to miss a dance unless it occurred on the same night with another
one which you attended And you showed such shocking bad taste too
in dancing too often with the same partner Let me see what was that
Forbes girls namethe one with wall eyesMabel wasnt it

No Adele Mabel was the one with the bony elbows That wasnt wall
in Adeles eyes It was soul We used to talk sonnets together and
Verlaine Just then I was trying to run a pipe from the Pierian
spring

You were on the floor with her said Octavia undeflected five
times at the Hammersmiths

Hammersmiths what questioned Teddy vacuously

Ballball said Octavia viciously What were we talking of

Eyes I thought said Teddy after some reflection and elbows

Those Hammersmiths went on Octavia in her sweetest society
prattle after subduing an intense desire to yank a handful of
sunburnt sandy hair from the head lying back contentedly against the
canvas of the steamer chair had too much money Mines wasnt it It
was something that paid something to the ton You couldnt get a glass
of plain water in their house Everything at that ball was dreadfully
overdone

It was said Teddy

Such a crowd there was Octavia continued conscious that she was
talking the rapid drivel of a schoolgirl describing her first dance
The balconies were as warm as the rooms Ilostsomething at
that ball The last sentence was uttered in a tone calculated to
remove the barbs from miles of wire

So did I confessed Teddy in a lower voice

A glove said Octavia falling back as the enemy approached her
ditches

Caste said Teddy halting his firing line without loss I
hobnobbed half the evening with one of Hammersmiths miners a fellow
who kept his hands in his pockets and talked like an archangel about
reduction plants and drifts and levels and sluiceboxes

A pearlgray glove nearly new sighed Octavia mournfully

A bangup chap that McArdle maintained Teddy approvingly A
man who hated olives and elevators a man who handled mountains as
croquettes and built tunnels in the air a man who never uttered a
word of silly nonsense in his life Did you sign those leaserenewal
applications yet madama Theyve got to be on file in the land office
by the thirtyfirst

Teddy turned his head lazily Octavias chair was vacant


A certain centipede crawling along the lines marked out by fate
expounded the situation It was early one morning while Octavia and
Mrs Maclntyre were trimming the honeysuckle on the west gallery
Teddy had risen and departed hastily before daylight in response to
word that a flock of ewes had been scattered from their bedding ground
during the night by a thunderstorm

The centipede driven by destiny showed himself on the floor of the
gallery and then the screeches of the two women giving him his cue
he scuttled with all his yellow legs through the open door into the
furthermost west room which was Teddys Arming themselves with
domestic utensils selected with regard to their length Octavia and
Mrs Maclntyre with much clutching of skirts and skirmishing for the
position of rear guard in the attacking force followed

Once outside the centipede seemed to have disappeared and his
prospective murderers began a thorough but cautious search for their
victim

Even in the midst of such a dangerous and absorbing adventure Octavia
was conscious of an awed curiosity on finding herself in Teddys
sanctum In that room he sat alone silently communing with those
secret thoughts that he now shared with no one dreamed there whatever
dreams he now called on no one to interpret

It was the room of a Spartan or a soldier In one corner stood a wide
canvascovered cot in another a small bookcase in another a grim
stand of Winchesters and shotguns An immense table strewn with
letters papers and documents and surmounted by a set of pigeonholes
occupied one side

The centipede showed genius in concealing himself in such bare
quarters Mrs Maclntyre was poking a broomhandle behind the
bookcase Octavia approached Teddys cot The room was just as the
manager had left it in his hurry The Mexican maid had not yet given
it her attention There was his big pillow with the imprint of his
head still in the centre She thought the horrid beast might have
climbed the cot and hidden itself to bite Teddy Centipedes were thus
cruel and vindictive toward managers

She cautiously overturned the pillow and then parted her lips to give
the signal for reinforcements at sight of a long slender dark object
lying there But repressing it in time she caught up a glove a
pearlgray glove flattenedit might be conceivedby many many
months of nightly pressure beneath the pillow of the man who had
forgotten the Hammersmiths ball Teddy must have left so hurriedly
that morning that he had for once forgotten to transfer it to its
restingplace by day Even managers who are notoriously wily and
cunning are sometimes caught up with

Octavia slid the gray glove into the bosom of her summery morning gown
It was hers Men who put themselves within a strong barbedwire fence
and remember Hammersmith balls only by the talk of miners about
sluiceboxes should not be allowed to possess such articles

After all what a paradise this prairie country was How it blossomed
like the rose when you found things that were thought to be lost How
delicious was that morning breeze coming in the windows fresh and
sweet with the breath of the yellow ratama blooms Might one not
stand for a minute with shining fargazing eyes and dream that
mistakes might be corrected

Why was Mrs Maclntyre poking about so absurdly with a broom

Ive found it said Mrs MacIntyre banging the door Here it is

Did you lose something asked Octavia with sweetly polite
noninterest

The little devil said Mrs Maclntyre driven to violence Yeve no
forgotten him alretty

Between them they slew the centipede Thus was he rewarded for his
agency toward the recovery of things lost at the Hammersmiths ball

It seems that Teddy in due course remembered the glove and when he
returned to the house at sunset made a secret but exhaustive search
for it Not until evening upon the moonlit eastern gallery did he
find it It was upon the hand that he had thought lost to him forever
and so he was moved to repeat certain nonsense that he had been
commanded never never to utter again Teddys fences were down

This time there was no ambition to stand in the way and the wooing
was as natural and successful as should be between ardent shepherd and
gentle shepherdess

The prairies changed to a garden The Rancho de las Sombras became the
Ranch of Light

A few days later Octavia received a letter from Mr Bannister in
reply to one she had written to him asking some questions about her
business A portion of the letter ran as follows


 I am at a loss to account for your references to the sheep ranch
 Two months after your departure to take up your residence upon it
 it was discovered that Colonel Beauprees title was worthless A
 deed came to light showing that he disposed of the property before
 his death The matter was reported to your manager Mr Westlake
 who at once repurchased the property It is entirely beyond my
 powers of conjecture to imagine how you have remained in ignorance
 of this fact I beg that you that will at once confer with that
 gentleman who will at least corroborate my statement


Octavia sought Teddy with battle in her eye

What are you working on this ranch for she asked once more

One hundred he began to repeat but saw in her face that she
knew She held Mr Bannisters letter in her hand He knew that the
game was up

Its my ranch said Teddy like a schoolboy detected in evil Its
a mighty poor manager that isnt able to absorb the bosss business if
you give him time

Why were you working down here pursued Octavia still struggling
after the key to the riddle of Teddy

To tell the truth Tave said Teddy with quiet candour it wasnt
for the salary That about kept me in cigars and sunburn lotions I
was sent south by my doctor Twas that right lung that was going to
the bad on account of overexercise and strain at polo and gymnastics
I needed climate and ozone and rest and things of that sort

In an instant Octavia was close against the vicinity of the affected
organ Mr Bannisters letter fluttered to the floor

Itsits well now isnt it Teddy

Sound as a mesquite chunk I deceived you in one thing I paid fifty
thousand for your ranch as soon as I found you had no title I had
just about that much income accumulated at my bankers while Ive been
herding sheep down here so it was almost like picking the thing up on
a bargaincounter for a penny Theres another little surplus of
unearned increment piling up there Tave Ive been thinking of a
wedding trip in a yacht with white ribbons tied to the mast through
the Mediterranean and then up among the Hebrides and down Norway to
the Zuyder Zee

And I was thinking said Octavia softly of a wedding gallop with
my manager among the flocks of sheep and back to a wedding breakfast
with Mrs MacIntyre on the gallery with maybe a sprig of orange
blossom fastened to the red jar above the table

Teddy laughed and began to chant

 Little BoPeep has lost her sheep
 And doesnt know where to find em
 Let em alone and theyll come home
 And

Octavia drew his head down and whispered in his ear But that is one
of the tales they brought behind them

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergorgfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
