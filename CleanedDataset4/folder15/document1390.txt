THE JIMMYJOHN BOSS AND OTHER STORIES

By Owen Wister




To Messrs Harper  Bothers and Henry Mills Alden whose friendliness and
fair dealing I am glad of this chance to record

Preface

 Its very plain that if a things the fashion
 Too much the fashionif the people leap
 To do it or to be it in a passion
 Of haste and crowding like a herd of sheep

 Why then that thing becomes through imitation
 Vulgar excessive obvious and cheap

 No gentleman desires to be pursuing

 What every Tom and Dick and Harrys doing

 Stranger do you write books I ask the question
 Because Im told that everybody writes
 That what with scribbling eating and digestion
 And proper slumber all our days and nights

 Are wholly filled It seems an odd suggestion
 But if you do write stop it leave the masses
 Read me and join the small selected classes




The Jimmyjohn Boss


I

One day at Nampa which is in Idaho a ruddy old massive jovial man
stood by the Silver City stage patting his beard with his left hand
and with his right the shoulder of a boy who stood beside him He had
come with the boy on the branch train from Boise because he was a
careful German and liked to say everything twicetwice at least when it
was a matter of business This was a matter of very particular business
and the German had repeated himself for nineteen miles Presently the
eastbound on the main line would arrive from Portland then the Silver
City stage would take the boy south on his new mission and the man
would journey by the branch train back to Boise From Boise no one could
say where he might not go west or east He was a great and pervasive
cattle man in Oregon California and other places Vogel and Lexeven
today you may hear the two ranch partners spoken of So the veteran
Vogel was now once more going over his notions and commands to his
youthful deputy during the last precious minutes until the eastbound
should arrive

Und if only you haf someding like dis said the old man as he tapped
his beard and patted the boy it would be five hoondert more dollars
salary in your liddle pants

The boy winked up at his employer He had a gray humorous eye he was
slim and alert like a sparrowhawkthe sort of boy his father openly
rejoices in and his mother is secretly in prayer over Only this boy
had neither father nor mother Since the age of twelve he had looked out
for himself never quite without bread sometimes attaining champagne
getting along in his American way variously on horse or afoot across
regions of wide plains and mountains through towns where not a soul
knew his name He closed one of his gray eyes at his employer and
beyond this made no remark

Vat you mean by dat vink anyhow demanded the elder

Say said the boy confidentiallyhonest now How about you and me
Five hundred dollars if I had your beard Youve got a record and Ive
got a future And my blooms on me rich without a scratch How many
dollars you gif me for dat bloom The sparrowhawk sailed into a
freakish imitation of his master

You are a liddle rascal cried the master shaking with entertainment
Und if der peoples vas to hear you sass old Max Vogel in dis style they
would say Poor old Max he lose his grrip But I dont lose it His
great hand closed suddenly on the boys shoulder his voice cut clean
and heavy as an axe and then no more joking about him Haf you
understand that he said

Yes sir

How old are you son

Nineteen sir

Oh my that is offle young for the job I gif you Some of dose man you
go to boss might be your father Und how much do you weigh

About a hundred and thirty

Too light too light Und I haf keep my eye on you in Boise You are
not so goot a boy as you might be

Well sir I guess not

But you was not so bad a boy as you might be neider You dont lie
about it Now it must be farewell to all that foolishness Haf you
understand You go to set an example where one is needed very bad If
those men see you drink a liddle they drink a big lot You forbid them
they laugh at you You must not allow one drop of whiskey at the whole
place Haf you well understand

Yes sir Me and whiskey are not necessary to each others happiness

It is not you it is them How are you mit your gun

Vogel took the boys pistol from its holster and aimed at an empty
bottle which was sticking in the thin Deceiver snow Can you do this
he said carelessly and fired The snow struck the bottle but the
unharming bullet was buried half an inch to the left

The boy took his pistol with solemnity No he said Guess I cant do
that He fired and the glass splintered into shapelessness Told you
I couldnt miss as close as you did said he

You are a darling said Mr Vogel Gif me dat lofely weapon

A fortunate store of bottles lay leaned or stood about in the white
snow of Nampa and Mr Vogel began at them

May I ask if anything is the matter inquired a mild voice from the
stage

Stick that lily head indoors shouted Vogel and the face and
eyeglasses withdrew again into the stage The schoolteacher he will
be beautifool virtuous company for you at Malheur Agency continued
Vogel shooting again and presently the large old German destroyed a
bottle with a crashing smack Ah said he in unison with the smack
Ahha No von shall say der old Max lose his grrip I shoot it efry
time now but the train she whistle I hear her

The boy affected to listen earnestly

Bah I tell you I hear de whistle coming

Did you say there was a whistle ventured the occupant of the stage
The snow shone white on his glasses as he peered out

Nobody whistle for you returned the robust Vogel You listen to me
he continued to the boy You are offle yoong But I watch you plenty
this long time I see you work mit my stock on the Owyhee and the
Malheur I see you mit my oder men My men they say always more and
more Yoong Drake he is a goot one und I think you are a goot one
mine own self I am the biggest cattle man on the Pacific slope und I
am also an old devil I have think a lot und I like you

Im obliged to you sir

Shut oop I like you und therefore I make you my new sooperintendent
at my Malheur Agency rranch mit a bigger salary as you dont get
before If you are a sookcess I rraise you some more

I am satisfied now sir

Bah Never do you tell any goot business man you are satisfied mit vat
he gif you for eider he dont believe you or else he think you are a
fool Und eider ways you go down in his estimation You make those men
at Malheur Agency behave themselves und I rraise you Only I do vish I
do certainly vish you had some beard on that yoong chin

The boy glanced at his pistol

No no no my son said the sharp old German I dont want gunpowder
in dis affair You must act kviet und decisif und keep your liddle shirt
on What you accomplish shootin You kill somebody und then pop
somebody kills you What goot is all that nonsense to me

It would annoy me some too retorted the boy eyeing the capitalist
Dont leave me out of the proposition

Broposition Broposition Now you get hot mit old Max for nothing

If you didnt contemplate trouble pursued the boy what was your
point just now in sampling my marksmanship He kicked some snow in the
direction of the shattered bottle Its understood no whiskey comes on
that ranch But if no gunpowder goes along with me either lets call
the deal off Buy some other fool

You haf not understand my boy Und you get very hot because I happen
to make that liddle joke about somebody killing you Was you thinking
maybe old Max not care what happen to you

A moment of silence passed before the answer came Suppose we talk
business

Very well very well Only notice this thing When oder peoples talk
oop to me like you haf done many times it is not they who does the
getting hot It is meold Max Und when old Max gets hot he slings them
out of his road anywheres Some haf been very sorry they get so slung
You invite me to buy some oder fool Oh my boy I will buy no oder fool
except you for that was just like me when I was yoong Max Again the
ruddy and grizzled magnate put his hand on the shoulder of the boy who
stood looking away at the bottles at the railroad track at anything
save his employer

The employer proceeded I was afraid of nobody und noding in those
days You are afraid of nobody and noding But those days was different
No Pullman sleepers no railroad at all We come oop the Columbia in
the steamboat we travel hoonderts of miles by team we sleep we eat
nowheres in particular mit many unexpected interooptions There was
Indians there was offle bad white men und if you was not offle
yourself you vanished quickly Therefore in those days was Max Vogel
hell und repeat

The magnate smiled a broad fond smile over the past which he had kicked
driven shot bled and battled through to present power and the boy
winked up at him again now

I dont propose to vanish myself said he

Ahha you was no longer mad mit der old Max Of coorse I care what
happens to you I was alone in the world myself in those lofely wicked
days

Reserve again made flinty the boys face

Neider did I talk about my feelings continued Max Vogel but I nefer
show them too quick If I was injured I wait and I strike to kill We
all paddles our own dugout eh We ask no favors from nobody we must
win our spurs Not so Now I talk business with you where you interroopt
me If cowboys was not so offle scarce in the country I would long ago
haf bounce the lot of those drunken fellows But they cannot be spared
we must get along so I cannot send Brock he is needed at Harpers The
dumb fellow at Alvord Lake is too dumb he is not quickly courageous
They would play high jinks mit him Therefore I send you Brock he say
to me you haf joodgement I watch and I say to myself also this boy
haf goot joodgement And when you look at your pistol so quick I tell
you quick I dont send you to kill men when they are so scarce already
My boy it is ever the moral the saynoding strength what gets
theremit always the liddle pistol behind in casejoost in case Haf
you understand I ask you to shoot I see you know how as Brock told
me I recommend you to let them see that aggomplishment in a friendly
way Maybe a shootingmatch mit prizesI pay for thempretty soon
after you come Und joodgementund joodgement Here comes that train
Haf you well understand

Upon this the two shook hands looking square friendship in each others
eyes The eastbound long quiet and dark beneath its flowing clots of
smoke slowed to a halt A few valises and legs descended ascended
herding and hurrying a few trunks were thrown resoundingly in and out
of the train a woolly crooked old man came with a box and a bandanna
bundle from the secondclass car the travellers of a thousand miles
looked torpidly at him through the dim dusty windows of their Pullman
and settled again for a thousand miles more Then the eastbound
shooting heavier clots of smoke laboriously into the air drew its slow
length out of Nampa and away

Wheres that stage shrilled the woolly old man Thats what Im
after

Why hello shouted Vogel Hello Uncle Pasco I heard you was dead

Uncle Pasco blinked his small eyes to see who hailed him Oh said he
in his light crusty voice Dutchy Vogel No I aint dead You guessed
wrong Not dead Help me up Dutchy

A tolerant smile broadened Vogels face It was ten years since I see
you said he carrying the old mans box

Shouldnt wonder Maybe itll be another ten till you see me next He
stopped by the stage step and wheeling nimbly surveyed his oldtime
acquaintance noting the good hat the prosperous watchchain the big
wellblacked boots Not seen me for ten years Heehee No Usent to
have a cent more than me Twins in poverty Thats how Dutchy and me
started If we was buried tomorrow theyd mark him Pecunious and me
Impecunious Thats what Twins in poverty

I stick to von business at a time Uncle said goodnatured
successful Max

A flicker of aberration lighted in the old mans eye Hm yes said
he pondering Stuck to one business So you did Hm Then suddenly
sly he chirped But Ive struck it rich now He tapped his box
Jewelry he halfwhispered Miners and cowboys

Yes said Vogel Those poor deluded fellows they buy such stuff
And he laughed at the seedy visionary who had begun frontier life
with him on the bottom rung and would end it there Do you play that
concertina yet Uncle he inquired

Yes yes I always play Its in here with my toothbrush and socks
Uncle Pasco held up the bandanna Well hes getting ready to start I
guess Ill be climbing inside Holy Gertrude

This shrill comment was at sight of the schoolmaster patient within
the stage What business are you in demanded Uncle Pasco

I am in the spelling business replied the teacher and smiled
faintly

Hell piped Uncle Pasco Take this

He handed in his bandanna to the traveller who received it politely
Max Vogel lifted the box of cheap jewelry and both he and the boy came
behind to boost the old man up on the stage step But with a nettled
look he leaped up to evade them tottered halfway and then light as a
husk of grain got himself to his seat and scowled at the schoolmaster

After a brief inspection of that pale spectacled face Dutchy he
called out of the door this country is not what it was

But old Max Vogel was inattentive He was speaking to the boy Dean
Drake and held a flask in his hand He reached the flask to his new
superintendent Drink hearty said he There son Dont be shy Haf
you forgot it is forbidden fruit after now

Kid sworn off inquired Uncle Pasco of the schoolmaster

I understand replied this person that Mr Vogel will not allow
his cowboys at the Malheur Agency to have any whiskey brought there
Personally I feel gratified And Mr Bolles the new schoolmaster
gave his faint smile

Oh muttered Uncle Pasco Forbidden to bring whiskey on the ranch
Hm His eyes wandered to the jewelrybox Hm said he again and
becoming thoughtful he laid back his motheaten sly head and spoke no
further with Mr Bolles

Dean Drake climbed into the stage and the vehicle started

Goot luck goot luck my son shouted the hearty Max and opened and
waved both his big arms at the departing boy He stood looking after the
stage I hope he come back said he I think he come back If he come
I rraise him fifty dollars without any beard


II

The stage had not trundled so far on its Silver City road but that a
whistle from Nampa station reached its three occupants This was the
branch train starting back to Boise with Max Vogel aboard and the boy
looked out at the locomotive with a sigh

Only five days of town he murmured Six months more wilderness now

My life has been too much town said the new schoolmaster I am
looking forward to a little wilderness for a change

Old Uncle Pasco leaning back said nothing he kept his eyes shut and
his ears open

Change is what I dont get sighed Dean Drake In a few miles
however before they had come to the ferry over Snake River the recent
leavetaking and his employers kind but dominating repression lifted
from the boys spirit His gray eye wakened keen again and he began
to whistle light opera tunes looking about him alertly like the
sparrowhawk that he was Ever see Jeannie Winston in Fatinitza he
inquired of Mr Bolles

The schoolmaster with a startled thankful countenance stated that he
had never

Ought to said Drake

 You a man that cant be true
 Men have never eyes like you

Thats what the girls in the harem sing in the second act Golly whiz
The boy gleamed over the memory of that evening

You have a hard job before you said the schoolmaster changing the
subject

Yep Hard The wary Drake shook his head warningly at Mr Bolles to
keep off that subject and he glanced in the direction of slumbering
Uncle Pasco Uncle Pasco was quite aware of all this I wouldnt take
another lonesome job so soon pursued Drake but I want the money
Ive been working eleven months along the Owyhee as a sort of junior
boss and Id earned my vacation Just got it started hot in Portland
when biff old Vogel telegraphs me Well Ill be saving instead of
squandering But it feels so good to squander

I have never had anything to squander said Bolles rather sadly

You dont say Well old man I hope you will It gives a man a lot
hell never get out of spellingbooks Are you cold Here And despite
the schoolmasters protest Dean Drake tucked his buffalo coat round
and over him Some day when Im old he went on I mean to live
respectable under my own cabin and vine Wife and everything But not
anyway till Im thirtyfive

He dropped into his opera tunes for a while but evidently it was
not Fatinitza and his vanished holiday over which he was chiefly
meditating for presently he exclaimed Ill give them a shootingmatch
in the morning You shoot

Bolles hoped he was going to learn in this country and exhibited a
Smith  Wesson revolver

Drake grieved over it Wrap it up warm said he Ill lend you a
real one when we get to the Malheur Agency But you can eat anyhow
Christmas being next week you see my programme is shoot all AM and
eat all PM I wish you could light on a notion what prizes to give my
buccaroos

Buccaroos said Bolles

Yep Cowpunchers Vaqueros Buccaroos in Oregon Bastard Spanish word
you see drifted up from Mexico Vogel would not care to have me give
em money as prizes

At this Uncle Pasco opened an eye

How many buccaroos will there be Bolles inquired

At the Malheur Agency Its the headquarters of five of our ranches
There ought to be quite a crowd A dozen probably at this time of
year

Uncle Pasco opened his other eye Here you he said dragging at his
box under the seat Pull it cant you There Just what youre after
Theres your prizes Querulous and watchful like some aged rickety
ape the old man drew out his trinkets in shallow shelves

Sooner give em nothing said Dean Drake

Whats that Whats the matter with them

Guess the boys have had all the brass rings and glass diamonds they
want

Thats all you know then I sold that box clean empty through the
Palouse country last week cept the bottom drawer and an outfit on
Meachams hill took that Shows all you know Im going clean through
your country after Ive quit Silver City Ill start in by Baker City
again and Ill strike Harney and maybe Ill go to Linkville I know
what buccaroos want Ill go to Fort Rinehart and Ill go to the Island
Ranch and first thing youll be seeing your boys wearing my stuff all
over their fingers and Sunday shirts and giving their girls my stuff
right in Harney City Thats what

All right Uncle Its a free country

Shaw Guess it is I was in it before you was too You were wet behind
the ears when I was jammin all around here How many are they up at
your place did you say

I said about twelve If youre coming our way stop and eat with us

Maybe I will and maybe I wont Uncle Pasco crossly shoved his box
back

All right Uncle Its a free country repeated Drake

Not much was said after this Uncle Pasco unwrapped his concertina from
the red handkerchief and played nimbly for his own benefit At Silver
City he disappeared and finding he had stolen nothing from them they
did not regret him Dean Drake had some affairs to see to here before
starting for Harpers ranch and it was pleasant to Bolles to find how
Drake was esteemed through this country The schoolmaster was to board
at the Malheur Agency and had come this way round because the new
superintendent must so travel They were scarcely birds of a feather
Drake and Bolles yet since one remote roof was to cover them the
indoor man was glad this boyhost had won so much goodwill from
high and low That the shrewd old Vogel should trust so much in a
nineteenyearold was proof enough at least of his character but when
Brock the foreman from Harpers came for them at Silver City Bolles
witnessed the affection that the rougher man held for Drake Brock shook
the boys hand with that serious quietness and absence of words which
shows the Western heart is speaking After a look at Bolles and a silent
bestowing of the baggage aboard the team he cracked his long whip and
the three rattled happily away through the dips of an open country where
clear streams ran blue beneath the winter air They followed the Jordan
that Idaho Jordan west towards Oregon and the Owyhee Brock often
turning in his drivers seat so as to speak with Drake He had a long
gradual chapter of confidences and events through miles he unburdened
these to his favorite

The California mare was coring well in harness The eagle over at
Whitehorse ranch had fought the cat most terrible Gilbert had got a
mulekick in the stomach but was eating his three meals They had a new
boy who played the guitar He used maplesyrup an his meat and claimed
he was from Alabama Brock guessed things were about as usual in most
ways The new well had caved in again Then in the midst of his gossip
the thing he had wanted to say all along came out Were pleased about
your promotion said he and blushing shook Drakes hand again

Warmth kindled the boys face and next with a sudden severity he
said Youre keeping back something

The honest Brock looked blank then labored in his memory

Has the sorrel girl in Harney married you yet said Drake Brock
slapped his leg and the horses jumped at his mirth He was mostly
gravemannered but when his boy superintendent joked he rejoiced with
the same pride that he took in all of Drakes excellences

The boys in this country will back you up said he next day and
Drake inquired What news from the Malheur Agency

Since the new Chinaman has been cooking for them said Brock they
have been peaceful as a man could wish

Theyll approve of me then Drake answered Im feeding em hyas
Christmas muckamuck

And what may that be asked the schoolmaster

You no kumtux Chinook inquired Drake Travel with me and youll
learn all sorts of languages It means just a big feed All whiskey is
barred he added to Brock

Its the only way said the foreman Theyve got those Pennsylvania
men up there

Drake had not encountered these

The three brothers Drinker said Brock Full Halfpast Full and
Drunk are what they call them Thems the names theyve brought them
from Klamath and Rogue River

I should not think a Chinaman would enjoy such comrades ventured Mr
Bolles

Chinamen dont have comrades in this country said Brock briefly
They like his cooking Its a lonesome section up there and a Chinaman
could hardly quit it not if he was expected to stay Suppose they kick
about the whiskey rule he suggested to Drake

Cant help what they do Oh Ill give each boy his turn in Harney City
when he gets anxious Its the whole united lot I dont propose to have
cut up on me

A look of concern for the boy came over the face of foreman Brock
Several times again before their parting did he thus look at his
favorite They paused at Harpers for a day to attend to some matters
and when Drake was leaving this place one of the men said to him Well
stand by you But from his blithe appearance and talk as the slim boy
journeyed to the Malheur River and Headquarter ranch nothing seemed
to be on his mind Oregon twinkled with sun and fine white snow They
crossed through a world of pines and creviced streams and exhilarating
silence The little waters fell tinkling through icicles in the
loneliness of the woods and snowshoe rabbits dived into the brush East
Oregon the Owyhee and the Malheur country the old trails of General
Crook the willows by the streams the open swales the high woods
where once Buffalo Horn and Chief Eegante and Oits the medicineman
prospered through this domain of war and memories went Bolles the
schoolmaster with Dean Drake and Brock The third noon from Harpers
they came leisurely down to the old Malheur Agency where once the
hostile Indians had drawn pictures on the door and where Castle Rock
frowned down unchanged

I wish I was going to stay here with you said Brock to Drake By
Indian Creek you can send word to me quicker than weve come

Why youre an old bat said the boy to his foreman and clapped him
farewell on the shoulder

Brock drove away thoughtful He was not a large man His face was
cleancut almost delicate He had a welltrimmed yellow mustache and
it was chiefly in his blue eye and lean cheekbone that the frontiersman
showed He loved Dean Drake more than he would ever tell even to
himself

The young superintendent set at work to ranchwork this afternoon of
Brocks leaving and the buccaroos made his acquaintance one by one and
stared at him Villany did not sit outwardly upon their faces they were
not villains but they stared at the boy sent to control them and they
spoke together laughing Drake took the head of the table at supper
with Bolles on his right Down the table some silence some staring
much laughing went onthe rich brute laugh of the belly untroubled by
the brain Sam the Chinaman rapid and noiseless served the dishes

What is it said a buccaroo

Can it bite said another

If you guess what it is you can have it said a third

Its meat remarked Drake incisively helping himself and tougher
than it looks

The brute laugh rose from the crowd and fell into surprised silence but
no rejoinder came and they ate their supper somewhat thoughtfully The
Chinamans quick soft eye had glanced at Dean Drake when they laughed
He served his dinner solicitously In his kitchen that evening he and
Bolles unpacked the good thingsthe olives the dried fruits the
cigarsbrought by the new superintendent for Christmas and finding
Bolles harmless like his gentle Asiatic self Sam looked cautiously
about and spoke

You not know why they laugh said he They not talk about my meat
then They mean new boss Misser Dlake He velly young boss

I think said Bolles Mr Drake understood their meaning Sam I have
noticed that at times he expresses himself peculiarly I also think they
understood his meaning

The Oriental pondered Me like Misser Dlake said he And drawing
quite close he observed They not nice man velly much

Next day and every day Misser Dlake went gayly about his business at
his desk or on his horse vigilant near and far with no sign save a
steadier keenness in his eye For the Christmas dinner he provided
still further sending to the Grande Ronde country for turkeys and other
things He won the heart of Bolles by lending him a good horse but the
buccaroos though they were boisterous over the coming Christmas joy
did not seem especially grateful Drake however kept his worries to
himself

This thing happens anywhere he said one night in the office to
Bolles puffing a cigar Ive seen a troop of cavalry demoralize itself
by a sort of contagion from two or three men

I think it was wicked to send you here by yourself blurted Bolles

Poppycock Its the chance of my life and Ill jam her through or
bust

I think they have decided you are getting turkeys because you are
afraid of them said Bolles

Why of course But d you figure Im the man to abandon my Christmas
turkey because my motives for eating it are misconstrued

Dean Drake smoked for a while then a knock came at the door Five
buccaroos entered and stood close as is the way with the guilty who
feel uncertain

We were thinking as maybe youd let us go over to town said Halfpast
Full the spokesman

When

Oh any day along this week

Cant spare you till after Christmas

Maybe youll not object to one of us goin

Youll each have your turn after this week

A slight pause followed Then Halfpast Full said What would you do if
I went anyway

Cant imagine Drake answered easily Go and Ill be in a position
to inform you

The buccaroo dropped his stolid bull eyes but raised them again and
grinned Well Im not particular about goin this week boss

Thats not my name said Drake but its what I am

They stood a moment Then they shuffled out It was an orderly
retreatalmost

Drake winked over to Bolles That was a graze said he and smoked for
a while Theyll not go this time Question is will they go next


III

Drake took a fresh cigar and threw his legs over the chair arm

I think you smoke too much said Bolles whom three days had made
familiar and friendly

Yep Have to just now Thats what as Uncle Pasco would say They are
a halfbreed lot though the boy continued returning to the buccaroos
and their recent visit Weaken in the face of a straight bluff you
see unless they get whiskeycourageous And Ive called em down on
that

Oh said Bolles comprehending

Didnt you see that was their game But he will not go after it

The flesh is all they seem to understand murmured Bolles

Halfpast Full did not go to Harney City for the tabooed whiskey nor
did any one Drake read his buccaroos like the children that they were
After the late encounter of grit the atmosphere was relieved of storm
The children the primitive pagan dangerous children forgot all about
whiskey and lusted joyously for Christmas Christmas was coming No
work A shootingmatch A big feed Cheerfulness bubbled at the Malheur
Agency The weather itself was in tune Castle Rock seemed no longer
to frown but rose into the shining air a mass of friendly strength
Except when a rare sledge or horseman passed Mr Bolless journeys to
the school were all to show it was not some pioneer colony in a new
white silent world that heard only the playful shouts and songs of the
buccaroos The sun overhead and the hardcrushing snow underfoot filled
every one with a crisp tingling hilarity

Before the sun first touched Castle Rock on the morning of the feast
they were up and in high feather over at the bunkhouse They raced
across to see what Sam was cooking they begged and joyfully swallowed
lumps of his raw plumpudding Merry Christmas they wished him and
Melly Clismas said he to them They played leapfrog over by the
stable they put snow down each others backs Their shouts rang round
corners it was like boys let out of school When Drake gathered them
for the shootingmatch they cheered him when he told them there were
no prizes what did they care for prizes When he beat them all the
first round they cheered him again Pity he hadnt offered prizes He
wasnt a good business man after all

The rounds at the target proceeded through the forenoon Drake the
acclaimed leader and the Christmas sun drew to midsky But as its
splendor in the heavens increased the happy shoutings on earth began
to wane The body was all that the buccaroos knew well the flesh comes
pretty natural to all of usand who had ever taught these men about
the spirit The further they were from breakfast the nearer they were
to dinner yet the happy shootings waned The spirit is a strange thing
Often it dwells dumb in human clay then unexpectedly speaks out of the
clays darkness

It was no longer a crowd Drake had at the target He became aware that
quietness had been gradually coming over the buccaroos He looked and
saw a man wandering by himself in the lane Another leaned by the stable
corner with a vacant face Through the windows of the bunkhouse
he could see two or three on their beds The children were tired of
shouting Drake went indoors and threw a great log on the fire It
blazed up high with sparks and he watched it although the sun shown
bright on the windowsill Presently he noticed that a man had come in
and taken a chair It was Halfpast Full and with his boots stretched
to the warmth he sat gazing into the fire The door opened and another
buckaroo entered and sat off in a corner He had a bundle of old
letters smeared sheets tied trite a twisted old ribbon While his
large toptoughened fingers softly loosened the ribbon he sat with his
back to the room and presently began to read the letters over one
by one Most of the men came in before long and silently joined the
watchers round the treat fireplace Drake threw another log on and in
a short time this too broke into ample flame The silence was long
a slice of shadow had fallen across the windowsill when a young man
spoke addressing the logs

I skinned a coon in San Saba Texas this day a year

At the sound of a voice some of their eyes turned on the speaker but
turned back to the fire again The spirit had spoken from the clay
aloud and the clay was uncomfortable at hearing it

After some more minutes a neighbor whispered to a neighbor Play you a
game of crib

The man nodded stole over to where the board was and brought it across
the floor on creaking tiptoe They set it between them and now and
then the cards made a light sound in the room

I treed that coon on Honey said the young man after a whileHoney
Creek San Saba Kind o dry creek Used to flow into Big Brady when it
rained

The flames crackled on the neighbors still played their cribbage Still
was the day bright but the shrinking wedge of sun had gone entirely
from the windowsill Halfpast Full had drawn from his pocket a
mouthorgan breathing halftunes upon it in the middle of Suwanee
River the man who sat in the corner laid the letter he was beginning
upon the heap on his knees and read no more The great genial logs lay
glowing burning from the fresher one the flames flowed and forked
along the embered surface of the others ran red and blue shivers of
iridescence With legs and arms crooked and sprawled the buccaroos
brooded staring into the glow with seldomwinking eyes while deep
inside the clay the spirit spoke quietly Christmas Day was passing
but the sun shone still two good hours high Outside over the snow
and pines it was only in the deeper folds of the hills that the blue
shadows had come the rest of the world was gold and silver and from
far across that silence into this silence by the fire came a tinkling
stir of sound Sleighbells it was steadily coming too early for Bolles
to be back from his school festival

The toythrill of the jingling grew clear and sweet a spirit of
enchantment that did not wake the stillness but cast it into a deeper
dream The bells came near the door and stopped and then Drake opened
it

Hello Uncle Pasco said he Thought you were Santa Claus

Santa Claus Hm Yes Thats what Told you maybe Id come

So you did Turkey is due inlets seeninety minutes Here boys
some of you take Uncle Pascos horse

No no I wont You leave me alone I aint stoppin here I aint
hungry I just grubbed at the school Sleepin at Missouri Petes
tonight Got to make the railroad tomorrow The old man stopped his
precipitate statements He sat in his sledge deeply muffled blinking
at Drake and the buccaroos who had strolled out to look at him Done a
big business this trip said he Told you I would Now if you was only
givin your children a Christmastree like that I seen that feller yer
schoolmarm doin just nowheehee From his blankets he revealed the
wellknown case Them things would shine on a tree concluded Uncle
Pasco

Hang em in the woods then said Drake

Jewelry is it inquired the young Texas man

Uncle Pasco whipped open his case There you are said he All whats
left That ringll cost you a dollar

Ive a dollar somewheres said the young man fumbling

Halfpast Full on the other side of the sleigh stood visibly
fascinated by the wares he was given a skilful glimpse of down among the
blankets He peered and he pondered while Uncle Pasco glibly spoke to
him

Scatter your truck out plain the buccaroo exclaimed suddenly Im
not buying in the dark Come over to the bunkhouse and scatter

Brass will look just the same anywhere said Drake

Brass screamed Uncle Brass your eye

But the buccaroos plainly glad for distraction took the woolly old
scolding man with them Drake shouted that if getting cheated cheered
them by all means to invest heavily and he returned alone to his fire
where Bolles soon joined him They waited accordingly and byandby
the sleighbells jingled again As they had come out of the silence
so did they go into it their little silvery tinkle dancing away in the
distance faint and fainter then like a breath gone

Uncle Pascos trinkets had audibly raised the mens spirits They
remained in the bunkhouse their laughter reaching Drake and Bolles more
and more Sometimes they would scuffle and laugh loudly

Do you imagine its more leapfrog inquired the schoolmaster

Gambling said Drake Theyll keep at it now till one of them wins
everything the rest have bought

Have they been lively ever since morning

Had a reaction about noon said Drake Regular homesick spell I
felt sorry for em

They seem full of reaction said Bolles Listen to that

It was now near four oclock and Sam came in announcing dinner

All ready said the smiling Chinaman

Pass the good word to the bunkhouse said Drake if they can hear
you

Sam went across and the shouting stopped Then arose a thick volley of
screams and cheers

That dont sound right said Drake leaping to his feet In the next
instant the Chinaman terrified returned through the open door Behind
him lurched Halfpast Full and stumbled into the room His boot caught
and he pitched but saved himself and stood swaying heavily looking at
Drake The hair curled dense over his bull head his mustache was spread
with his grin the light of cloddish humor and destruction burned in his
big eye The clay had buried the spirit like a caving pit

Twas false jewelry all right he roared at the top of his voice A
good old jimmyjohn full boss Say boss goin to run our jimmyjohn off
the ranch Try it on kid Come over and try it on The bull beat on
the table

Dean Drake had sat quickly down in his chair his gray eye upon the
hulking buccaroo Small and dauntless he sat a sparrowhawk caught in a
trap and game to the endwhatever end

Its a trifle tardy to outline any policy about your demijohn said
he seriously You folks had better come in and eat before youre
beyond appreciating

Ho well eat your grub boss Sams cooking goes The buccaroo
lurched out and away to the bunkhouse where new bellowing was set up

Ive got to carve this turkey friend said the boy to Bolles

Ill do my best to help eat it returned the schoolmaster smiling

Misser Dlake said poor Sam I solly you I velly solly you


IV

Reserve your sorrow Sam said Dean Drake Give us your soup for a
starter Come he said to Bolles Quick

He went into the diningroom prompt in his seat at the head of the
table with the schoolmaster next to him

Nice man Uncle Pasco he continued But his time is not now We have
nothing to do for the present but sit like every day and act perfectly
natural

I have known simpler tasks said Mr Bolles but Ill begin by
spreading this excellently clean napkin

Youre no schoolmarm exclaimed Drake you please me

The worst of a bad thing said the mild Bolles is having time to
think about it and we have been spared that

Here they come said Drake

They did come But Drakes alert strategy served the end he had tried
for The drunken buccaroos swarmed disorderly to the door and halted
Once more the new superintendents ways took them aback Here was the
decent table with lights serenely burning with unwonted good things
arranged upon itthe olives the oranges the preserves Neat as parade
drill were the mens places all the cups and forks symmetrical along
the white cloth There waiting his guests at the far end sat the slim
young boss talking with his boarder Mr Bolles the parts in their
smooth hair going with all the rest of this propriety Even the daily
tin dishes were banished in favor of crockery

Bashful of Sams napkins boys said the boss Or is it the
baldheaded china

At this bidding they came in uncertainly Their whiskey was ashamed
inside They took their seats glancing across at each other in a
transient silence drawing their chairs gingerly beneath them Thus
ceremony fell unexpected upon the gathering and for a while they
swallowed in awkwardness what the swift noiseless Sam brought them
He in a long white apron passed and repassed with his things from his
kitchen doubly efficient and civil under stress of anxiety for
his young master In the pauses of his serving he watched from the
background with a face that presently caught the notice of one of them

Smile you almondeyed highbinder said the buccaroo And the Chinaman
smiled his best

Ive forgot something said Halfpast Full rising Dont let em
skip a course on me Halfpast left the room

Thats what I have been hoping for said Drake to Bolles

Halfpast returned presently and caught Drakes look of expectancy Oh
no boss said the buccaroo instantly from the door Youre on to
me but Im on to you He slammed the door with ostentation and dropped
with a loud laugh into his seat

First smart thing Ive known him do said Drake to Bolles I am
disappointed

Two buccaroos next left the room together

They may get lost in the snow said the humorous Halfpast Ill just
show em the trail Once more he rose from the dinner and went out

Yes he knew too much to bring it in here said Drake to Bolles He
knew none but two or three would dare drink with me looking on

Dont you think he is afraid to bring it in the same room with you at
all Bolles suggested

And me temperance this season Now Bolles thats unkind

Oh dear that is not at all what

I know what you meant Bolles I was only just making a little merry
over this casualty No he dont mind me to that extent except when
hes sober Look at him

Halfpast was returning with his friends Quite evidently they had all
found the trail

Uncle Pasco is a nice old man pursued Drake I havent got my gun
on Have you

Yes said Bolles but with a sheepish swerve of the eye

Drake guessed at once Not Baby Bunting Oh Lord and I promised
to give you an adult weaponthe kind theyre wearing now by way of
fulldress

Talkin secrets boss said Halfpast Full

The wellmeaning Sam filled his cup and this proceeding shifted the
buccaroos truculent attention

Whats that mud he demanded

Coffee said Sam politely

The buccaroo swept his cup to the ground and the next man howled
dismay

Burn your poor legs said Halfpast He poured his glass over the
victim They wrestled the company pounded the table betting hoarsely
until Halfpast went to the floor and his plate with him

Go easy said Drake Youre smashing the companys property

Baldheaded china for sure boss said a second of the brothers
Drinker and dropped a dish

Ill merely tell you said Drake that the company dont pay for this
china twice

Not twice said Halfpast Full smashing some more How about
thrice

Want your money now another inquired

A riot of banter seized upon all of them and they began to laugh and
destroy

How much did this cost said one prying askew his threetined fork

How much did you cost yourself said another to Drake

What our kid boss Two bits I guess

Hyas markook Too dear

They bawled at their own jokes loud and ominous threat sounded beneath
their lightest word the new crashes of china that they threw on the
floor struck sharply through the foreboding din of their mirth The
spirit that Drake since his arrival had kept under in them day by day
but not quelled rose visibly each few succeeding minutes swelling
upward as the tide does Buoyed up on the whiskey it glittered in their
eyes and yelled mutinously in their voices

Im waiting all orders said Bolles to Drake

I havent any said Drake New ones that is Weve sat down to see
this meal out Got to keep sitting

He leaned back eating deliberately saying no more to the buccaroos
thus they saw he would never leave the room till they did As he had
taken his chair the first so was the boy bound to quit it the last The
game of prying forktines staled on them one by one and they took to
songs mostly of love and parting With the red whiskey in their eyes
they shouted plaintively of sweethearts and vows and lips and meeting
in the wild wood From these they went to ballads of the cattletrail
and the Yuba River and so inevitably worked to the old coast song made
of three languages with its verses rhymed on each year since the first
beginning Tradition laid it heavy upon each singer in his turn to keep
the pot aboiling by memory or by new invention and the chant went
forward with hypnotic cadence to a tune of larkish ripping gayety He
who had read over his old stained letters in the homesick afternoon had
waked from such dreaming and now sang

 Once jes onced in the year o 49
 I met a fancy thing by the name o Keroline
 I never could persuade her for to leave me be
 She went and she took and she married me

His neighbor was ready with an original contribution

 Once once again in the year o 64
 By the city of Whatcom down along the shore
 I never could persuade them for to leave me be
 A Siwash squaw went and took and married me

What was you doin between all them years called Halfpast Full

Shut yer mouth said the next singer

 Once once again in the year o 71
 Twas the suddenest deed that I ever done
 I never could persuade them for to leave me be
 A rich bankers daughter she took and married me

This is looking better said Bolles to Drake

Dont you believe it said the boy

Ten or a dozen years were thus sung

I never could persuade them for to leave me be tempestuously brought
down the chorus and the fists until the drunkards could sit no more
but stood up to sing tramping the tune heavily together Then just as
the turn came round to Drake himself they dashed their chairs down and
herded out of the room behind Halfpast Full slamming the door

Drake sat a moment at the head of his Christmas dinner the fallen
chairs the lumpy wreck Blood charged his face from his hair to his
collar Lets smoke said he They went from the dinner through the
room of the great fireplace to his office beyond

Have a mild one he said to the schoolmaster

No a strong one tonight if you please And Bolles gave his mild
smile

You do me good now and then said Drake

Dear me said the teacher I have found it the other way

All the rooms fronted on the road with doorsthe oldtime agency doors
where the hostiles had drawn their pictures in the days before peace had
come to reign over this country Drake looked out because the singing
had stopped and they were very quiet in the bunkhouse He saw the
Chinaman steal from his kitchen

Sam is tired of us he said to Bolles

Tired

Running away I guess Id prefer a new situation myself Thats where
youre deficient Bolles Only got sense enough to stay where you happen
to be Hello What is he up to

Sam had gone beside a window of the bunkhouse and was listening there
flat like a shadow Suddenly he crouched and was gone among the sheds
Out of the bunkhouse immediately came a procession the buccaroos still
quiet a careful gradual body

Drake closed his door and sat in the chair again Theyre escorting
that jug over here said he A new move and a big one

He and Bolles heard them enter the next room always without much noise
or talkthe loudest sound was the jug when they set it on the floor
Then they seemed to sit talking little

Bolles said Drake the sun has set If you want to take after Sam

But the door of the sittingroom opened and the Chinaman himself came
in He left the door aswing and spoke clearly Misser Dlake said he
slove bloke stove broke

The superintendent came out of his office following Sam to the kitchen
He gave no look or word to the buccaroos with their demijohn he merely
held his cigar sidewise in his teeth and walked with no hurry through
the sittingroom Sam took him through to the kitchen and round to a
hind corner of the stove pointing

Misser Dlake said he slove no bloke I hear them inside They going
kill you

Thats about the way I was figuring it mused Dean Drake

Misser Dlake said the Chinaman with appealing eyes I velly solly
you They no hurtee me Me cook

Sam there is much meat in your words Condensed beef dont class with
you But reserve your sorrows yet a while Now whats my policy he
debated tapping the stove here and there for appearances somebody
might look in Shall I go back to my office and get my guns

You not goin run now said the Chinaman anxiously

Oh yes Sam But I like my gun travelling Keeps me kind of warm Now
if they should get a sight of me armingno shes got to stay here till
I come back for her So long Sam See you later And Ill have time to
thank you then

Drake went to the corral in a strolling manner There he roped the
strongest of the horses and also the schoolmasters In the midst of
his saddling Bolles came down

Can I help you in any way said Bolles

Youve done it Saved me a bothering touchandgo play to get you out
here and seem innocent Im going to drift

Drift

There are times to stay and times to leave Bolles and this is a case
of the latter Have you a real gun on now

Poor Bolles brought out guiltily his22 Smith  Wesson I dont seem to
think of things said he

Cheer up said Drake How could you thoughtread me Hide Baby
Bunting though Now were off Quietly at the start As if we were
merely jogging to pasture

Sam stood at his kitchen door mutely wishing them well The horses were
walking without noise but Halfpast Full looked out of the window

Were by anyhow said Drake Quick now Burn the earth The
horse sprang at his spurs Dust you son of a gun Rattle your hocks
Brindle Vamoose Each shouted word was a lash with his quirt Duck
he called to Bolles

Bolles ducked and bullets grooved the spraying snow They rounded a
corner and saw the crowd jumping into the corral and Sams door empty
of that prudent Celestial

Hes a very wise Chinaman shouted Drake as they rushed

What screamed Bolles

Very wise Chinaman Hell break that stove now to prove his innocence

Who did you say was innocent screamed Bolles

Oh I said you were yelled Drake disgusted and he gave over this
effort at conversation as their horses rushed along


V

It was a dim wide stretch of winter into which Drake and Bolles
galloped from the howling pursuit Twilight already veiled the base of
Castle Rock and as they forged heavily up a ridge through the caking
snow and the yells came after them Bolles looked seriously at Dean
Drake but that youth wore an expression of rising merriment Bolles
looked back at the dusk from which the yells were sounding then forward
to the spreading skein of night where the trail was taking him and the
boy and in neither direction could he discern cause for gayety

May I ask where we are going said he

Away Drake answered Just away Bolles Its a healthy resort

Ten miles were travelled before either spoke again The drunken
buccaroos yelled hot on their heels at first holding more obstinately
to this chase than sober ruffians would have attempted Ten cold dark
miles across the hills it took to cure them but when their shootings
that had followed over heights where the pines grew and down through
the open swales between dropped off and died finally away among the
willows along the south fork of the Malheur Drake reined in his horse
with a jerk

Now isnt that too bad he exclaimed

It is all very bad said Bolles sorry to hear the boys tone of
disappointment

I didnt think theyd fool me again continued Drake jumping down

Again inquired the interested Bolles

Why theyve gone home said the boy in disgust

I was hoping so said the schoolmaster

Hoping Why its sad Bolles Four miles farther and Id have had them
lost

Oh said Bolles

I wanted them to keep after us complained Drake Soon as we had a
good lead I coaxed them Coaxed them along on purpose by a trail they
knew and four miles from here Id have swung south into the mountains
they dont know There theyd have been good and far from home in the
snow without supper like you and me Bolles But after all my trouble
theyve gone back snug to that fireside Well let us be as cosey as we
can

He built a bright fire and he whistled as he kicked the snow from his
boots busying over the horses and the blankets Take a rest he said
to Bolles One mans enough to do the work Be with you soon to share
our little cottage Presently Bolles heard him reciting confidentially
to his horse Twas the night after Christmas and all in the
houseonly we are not all in the house He slapped the belly of his
horse Tyee who gambolled away to the limit of his picketrope

Appreciating the moon Bolles said he returning at length to the
fire What are you so gazeful about father

This is all my own doing lamented the schoolmaster

What the moon is

It has just come over me Bolles continued It was before you got in
the stage at Nampa I was talking I told Uncle Pasco that I was glad no
whiskey was to be allowed on the ranch It all comes from my folly

Why you hungry old New England conscience cried the boy clapping
him on the shoulder How in the world could you foresee the crookedness
of that hoary Beelzebub

Thats all very well said Bolles miserably You would never have
mentioned it yourself to him

You and I Bolles are different I was raised on miscellaneous
wickedness A look at my insides would be liable to make you say your
prayers

The schoolmaster smiled If I said any prayers he replied you
would be in them

Drake looked moodily at the fire The Lord helps those who help
themselves said he Ive prospered For a nineteenyearold Ive
hooked my claw fairly deep here and there As for todaywhy thats
in the game too It was their deal Could they have won it on their own
play A joker dropped into their hand Its my deal now and I have some
jokers myself Go to sleep Bolles Weve a ride ahead of us

The boy rolled himself in his blanket skillfully Bolles heard him say
once or twice in a sort of judicial conversation with the blanketand
all in the housebut we were not all in the house Not all Not a full
house His tones drowsed comfortably into murmur and then to quiet
breathing Bolles fed the fire thatched the unneeded windbreak for
the calm dry night was breathless and for a long while watched the
moon and a tuft of the sleeping boys hair

If he is blamed said the schoolmaster Ill never forgive myself
Ill never forgive myself anyhow

A paternal or rather maternal expression came over Bolless face and
he removed his large serious glasses He did not sleep very well

The boy did Im feeling like a bird said he as they crossed through
the mountains next morning on a short cut to the Owybee Breakfast will
brace you up Bolles Therell be a cabin pretty soon after we strike
the other road Keep thinking hard about coffee

I wish I could said poor Bolles He was forgiving himself less and
less

Their start had been very early as Drake bid the schoolmaster observe
to have nothing to detain you nothing to eat and nothing to pack is a
great help in journeys of haste The warming day and Indian Creek well
behind them brought Drake to whistling again but depression sat upon
the selfaccusing Bolles Even when they sighted the Owyhee road below
them no cheerfulness waked in him not at the nearing coffee nor
yet at the companionable tinkle of sleighbells dancing faintly upward
through the bright silent air

Why if it aint Uncle Pasco said Drake peering down through a gap
in the foothill Well get breakfast sooner than I expected Quick
Give me Baby Bunting

Are you going to kill him whispered the schoolmaster with a beaming
countenance And he scuffled with his pocket to hand over his hitherto
belittled weapon

Drake considered him Bolles Bolles said he you have got the
New England conscience rank Plymouth Rock is a pudding to your heart
Remind me to pray for you first spare minute I get Now follow me close
Hell be much more useful to us alive

They slipped from their horses stole swiftly down a shoulder of the
hill and waited among some brush The bells jingled unsuspectingly
onward to this ambush

Only hear em said Drake All full of silver and Merry Christmas
Dont gaze at me like that Bolles or Ill laugh and give the whole
snap away See him come The old mans breath streams out so calm Hes
not worried with New England conscience One two three Just before
the sleigh came opposite Dean Drake stepped out Morning Uncle said
he Throw up your hands

Uncle Pasco stopped dead his eyes blinking Then he stood up in the
sleigh among his blankets Hm said he the kid

Throw up your hands Quit fooling with that blanket Drake spoke
dangerously now Bolles he continued pitch everything out of the
sleigh while I cover him Hes got a shotgun under that blanket Sling
it out

It was slung The wraps followed Uncle Pasco stepped obediently down
and soon the chattels of the emptied sleigh littered the snow The old
gentleman was invited to undress until they reached the sixshooter that
Drake suspected Then they ate his lunch drank some whiskey that he had
not sold to the buccaroos told him to repack the sleigh allowed him
to wrap up again bade him take the reins and they would use his
sixshooter and shotgun to point out the road to him

He had said very little had Uncle Pasco but stood blinking obedient
and malignant Hm said he now goin to ride with me are you

He was told yes that for the present he was their coachman Their
horses were tired and would follow tied behind Were weary too
said Drake getting in Take your legs out of my way or Ill kick off
your shins Bolles are you fixed warm and comfortable Now start her up
for Harper ranch Uncle

What are you proposing to do with me inquired Uncle Pasco

Not going to wring your neck and thats enough for the present
Faster Uncle Get a gait on Bolles heres Baby Bunting Much obliged
to you for the loan of it old man

Uncle Pascos eye fell on the 22caliber pistol Did you hold me up
with that lemonade straw he asked huskily

Yep said Drake Thats what

Oh hell murmured Uncle Pasco And for the first time he seemed
dispirited

Uncle youre not making time said Drake after a few miles Ill
thank you for the reins Open your bandanna and get your concertina
Jerk the bellows for us

That Ill not screamed Uncle Pasco

Its music or walk home said the boy Take your choice

Uncle Pasco took his choice opening with the melody of The Last Rose
of Summer The sleigh whirled up the Owyhee by the winter willows and
the levels and the meadow pools bright frozen under the blue sky
Late in this day the amazed Brock by his corrals at Harpers beheld
arrive his favorite his boy superintendent driving in with the
schoolmaster staring through his glasses and Uncle Pasco throwing
out active strains upon his concertina The old man had been bidden to
bellows away for his neck

Drake was not long in explaining his need to the men This thing must
be worked quick said he Wholl stand by me

All of them would and he took ten with the faithful Brock Brock would
not allow Gilbert to go because he had received another mulekick in
the stomach Nor was Bolles permitted to be of the expedition To all
his protests Drake had but the single word This is not your fight
old man Youve done your share with Baby Bunting

Thus was the schoolmaster in sorrow compelled to see them start back
to Indian Creek and the Malheur without him With him Uncle Pasco would
have joyfully exchanged He was taken along with the avengers They
would not wring his neck but they would play cat and mouse with him and
his concertina and they did But the conscience of Bolles still toiled
When Drake and the men were safe away he got on the wagon going for the
mail thus making his way next morning to the railroad and Boise where
Max Vogel listened to him and together this couple hastily took train
and team for the Malheur Agency

The avengers reached Indian Creek duly and the fourth day after his
Christmas dinner Drake came once more in sight of Castle Rock

I am doing this thing myself understand he said to Brock I am
responsible

Were here to take your orders returned the foreman But as the
agency buildings grew plain and the time for action was coming Brocks
anxious heart spoke out of its fulness If they start in totothey
mightI wish youd let me get in front he begged all at once

I thought you thought better of me said Drake

Excuse me said the man Then presently I dont see how anybody
could a told hed smuggle whiskey that way If the old man Brock
meant Max Vogel goes to blame you Ill give him my opinion straight

The old mans got no use for opinions said Drake He goes on
results He trusted me with this job and were going to have results
now

The drunkards were sitting round outside the ranch house It was
evening They cast a sullen inspection on the newcomers who returned
them no inspection whatever Drake had his men together and took them
to the stable first a shed with mangers Here he had them unsaddle
Because he mentioned to Brock in case of trouble well be sure of
their all staying Im taking no chances now

Soon the drunkards strolled over saying goodday hazarding a few
comments on the weather and like topics and meeting sufficient answers

Goin to stay

Dont know

Thats a good horse youve got

Fair

But Sam was the blithest spirit at the Malheur Agency Hiyah he
exclaimed Misser Dlake How fashion you come quick so And the
excellent Chinaman took pride in the meal of welcome that he prepared

Suppers now said Drake to his men Sit anywhere you feel like
Dont mind whose chair youre takingand well keep our guns on

Thus they followed him and sat The boy took his customary perch at the
head of the table with Brock at his right I miss old Bolles he told
his foreman You dont appreciate Bolles

From what you tell of him said Brock Ill examine him more
careful

Seeing their boss the sparrowhawk back in his place flanked with
supporters and his gray eye indifferently upon them the buccaroos grew
polite to oppressiveness While Sam handed his dishes to Drake and
the newcomers and the newcomers eat what was good before the old
inhabitants got a taste these latter grew more and more solicitous
They offered sugar to the strangers they offered their beds Halfpast
Full urged them to sit companionably in the room where the fire was
burning But when the meal was over the visitors went to another room
with their arms and lighted their own fire They brought blankets from
their saddles and after a little concertina they permitted the nearly
perished Uncle Pasco to slumber Soon they slumbered themselves with
the door left open and Drake watching He would not even share vigil
with Brock and all night he heard the voices of the buccaroos holding
grand unending council

When the relentless morning came and breakfast with the visitors again
in their seats unapproachable the drunkards felt the crisis to be a
strain upon their sobered nerves They glanced up from their plates and
down along to Dean Drake eating his hearty porridge and back at one
another and at the hungry welloccupied strangers

Say we dont want trouble they began to the strangers

Course you dont Breakfasts what youre after

Oh well youd have got gay A man gets gay

Sure

Mr Drake said Halfpast Full sweating with his effort we were
sorry while we was afogging you up

Yes said Drake You must have been just overcome by contrition

A large laugh went up from the visitors and the meal was finished
without further diplomacy

One matter Mr Drake stammered Halfpast Full as the party rose
Our jobs Were glad to pay for any things what got sort of broke

Sort of broke repeated the boy eyeing him So you want to hold your
jobs

If began the buccaroo and halted

Fact is youre a set of cowards said Drake briefly I notice
youve forgot to remove that whiskey jug The demijohn still stood
by the great fireplace Drake entered and laid hold of it the crowd
standing back and watching He took it out with what remained in its
capacious bottom set it on a stump stepped back levelled his gun and
shattered the vessel to pieces The whiskey drained down wetting the
stump creeping to the ground

Much potency lies in the objectlesson and a grin was on the faces of
all present save Uncle Pascos It had been his demijohn and when the
shot struck it he blinked nervously

You ornery old mink said Drake looking at him You keep to the
jewelry business hereafter

The buccaroos grinned again It was reassuring to witness wrath turn
upon another

You want to hold your jobs Drake resumed to them You can trust
yourselves

Yes sir said Halfpast Full

But I dont trust you stated Drake genially and the buccaroos
hopeful eyes dropped Im going to divide you pursued the new
superintendent Split you far and wide among the companys ranches
Stir you in with decenter blood Youll go to Whitehorse ranch just
across the line of Nevada he said to Halfpast Full Im tired of the
brothers Drinker Youll golets see

Drake paused in his apportionment and a sleigh came swiftly round the
turn the horse loping and lathery

What vas dat shooting I hear joost now shouted Max Vogel before he
could arrive He did not wait for any answer Thank the good God he
exclaimed at seeing the boy Dean Drake unharmed standing with a gun
And to their amazement he sped past them never slacking his horses
lope until he reached the corral There he tossed the reins to the
placid Bolles and springing out like a surefooted elephant counted his
saddlehorses for he was a general Satisfied he strode back to the
crowd by the demijohn When dem men get restless he explained to
Drake at once always look out Somebody might steal a horse

The boy closed one gray confidential eye at his employer Just my
idea said he when I counted em before breakfast

You liddle rrascal said Max fondly What you shoot at

Drake pointed at the demijohn It was bigger than those bottles at
Nampa said he Guess you could have hit it yourself

Maxs great belly shook He took in the situation It had a flavor that
he liked He paused to relish it a little more in silence

Und you have killed noding else said he looking at Uncle Pasco who
blinked copiously Mine old friend you never get rich if you change
your business so frequent I tell you that thirty years now Maxs hand
found Drakes shoulder but he addressed Brock He is all what you tell
me said he to the foreman He have joodgement

Thus the huge jovial Teuton took command but found Drake had left
little for him to do The buccaroos were dispersed at Harpers at Fort
Rinehart at Alvord Lake towards Steins peak and at the Island Ranch
by Harney Lake And if you know east Oregon or the land where Chief
Eegante helped out Specimen Jones his white soldier friend when the
hostile Bannocks were planning his immediate death as a spy you will
know what wide regions separated the buccaroos Bolles was taken into
Max Vogels esteem also was Chinese Sam But Max sat smoking in the
office with his boy superintendent in particular satisfaction

You are a liddle rrascal said he Und I rraise you fifty dollars




A Kinsman of Red Cloud


I

It was thirty minutes before a June sundown at the post and the first
call had sounded for parade Over in the barracks the two companies
and the single troop lounged a moment longer then laid their police
literature down and lifted their stocking feet from the beds to get
ready In the officers quarters the captain rose regretfully from
afterdinner digestion and the three lieutenants sought their helmets
with a sigh Lieutenant Balwin had been dining an unconventional and
impressive guest at the mess and he now interrupted the anecdote which
the guest was achieving with frontier deliberation

Make yourself comfortable he said Ill have to hear the rest about
the halfbreed when I get back

There aint no moreyet He got my cash with his private poker deck
that onced and Im fixing for to get hisn

Second call sounded the lines filed out and formed the sergeant of
the guard and two privates took their station by the flag and when
battalion was formed the commanding officer towering steeplestiff
beneath his plumes received the adjutants salute ordered him to his
post and began drill At all this the unconventional guest looked on
comfortably from Lieutenant Balwins porch

I doubt if I could put up with that there discipline all the week he
mused Carryarms PresentArms I guess thats all I know of it
The winking white line of gloves stirred his approval Pretty good
that Gosh see the sun on them bayonets

The last note of retreat merged in the sonorous gun and the flag
shining in the light of evening slid down and rested upon the earth
The blue ranks marched to a single buglethe post was short of men and
officersand the captain with the released lieutenants again sought
digestion and cigars Balwin returned to his guest and together they
watched the day forsake the plain Presently the guest rose to take his
leave He looked old enough to be the father of the young officer but
he was a civilian and the military man proceeded to give him excellent
advice

Now dont get into trouble Cutler

The slouchshouldered scout rolled his quid gently and smiled at his
superior with indulgent regard

See here Cutler you have a highly unoccupied look about you this
evening Ive been studying the customs of this population and Ive
noted a fact or two

Let em loose on me sir

Fact one When any male inhabitant of Fort Laramie has a few spare
moments he hunts up a game of cards

Well sir youve called the turn on me

Fact two At Fort Laramie a game of cards frequently ends in
discussion

Fact three Mr Calvin in them discussions Jarvis Cutler has the last
word You put that in your census report alongside the other two

Well Cutler if somebodys gun should happen to beat yours in an
argument I should have to hunt another wagonmaster

Ill not forget that When was you expecting to pull out north

Whenever the other companies get here May be three daysmay be three
weeks

Then I will have plenty time for a game tonight

With this slight dig of his civilian independence into the lieutenants
military ribs the scout walked away his long lugubrious frockcoat
worn in honor of the mess occasionally flapping open in the breeze
and giving a view of a belt richly fluted with cartridges and the ivory
handle of a pistol looking out of its holster He got on his horse
crossed the flat and struck out for the cabin of his sociable friends
Loomis and Kelley on the hill The open door and a light inside showed
the company and Cutler gave a grunt for sitting on the table was the
halfbreed the winner of his unavenged dollars He rode slower in
order to think and arriving at the corral below the cabin tied his
horse to the stump of a cottonwood A few steps towards the door and he
wheeled on a sudden thought and under cover of the night did a crafty
something which to the pony was altogether unaccountable He unloosed
both front and rear cinch of his saddle so they hung entirely free in
wide bands beneath the ponys belly He tested their slackness with his
hand several times stopping instantly when the more and more surprised
pony turned his head to see what new thing in his experience might be
going on and seeing gave a delicate bounce with his hindquarters

Never you mind Duster muttered the scout Did you ever see a
skunktrap Oughts is for mushrats and number ones is mostly used
for coons and possums and I guess theyd do for a skunk But you and
well call this here trap a number two Duster for the skunk Im after
is a big one All youve to do is to act natural

Cutler took the rope off the stump by which Duster had been tied
securely wound and strapped it to the tilted saddle and instead of
this former tether made a weak knot in the reins and tossed them over
the stump He entered the cabin with a countenance sweeter than honey

Goodevening boys he said Why Toussaint how do you do

The hand of Toussaint had made a slight a very slight movement towards
his hip but at sight of Cutlers mellow smile resumed its clasp upon
his knee

Golly but youre gaylike this evening said Kelley

Blamed if I knowed he could look so frisky added Loomis

Sporting his oncedayear coat Kelley pursued That aint for our
benefit Joole

No were not that high in society Both these cheerful waifs had
drifted from the Atlantic coast westward

Cutler looked from them to his costume and then amiably surveyed the
halfbreed

Well boys Im in big luck I am Hows yourn nowadays Toussaint

Pretty good sometime Sometime heap hell The voice of the halfbreed
came as near heartiness as its singularly false quality would allow and
as he smiled he watched Cutler with the inside of his eyes

The scout watched nobody and nothing with great care looked about him
pleasantly inquired for the whiskey threw aside hat and gloves sat
down leaning the chair back against the wall and talked with artful
candor Them sprigs of lieutenants down there said he theyre a
surprising lot for learning virtue to a man You take Balwin Why he
aint been out of the Academy only two years and hes been telling me
how cardplaying aint good for you And what do you suppose hes been
and offered Jarvis Cutler for a job Im to be wagonmaster He
paused and the halfbreeds attention to his next words increased
Wagonmaster and good pay too Clean up to the Black Hills and the
troopsll move soon as ever them reinforcements come Drinks on it
boys Set em up Joole Loomis My contracts sealed with some of Uncle
Sams cash and Im going to play it right here Hello Somebody coming
to join us Hes in a hurry

There was a sound of lashing straps and hoofs beating the ground and
Cutler looked out of the door As he had calculated the saddle had
gradually turned with Dusters movements and set the pony bucking

Stampeded said the scout and swore the proper amount called for by
such circumstances Some o you boys help me stop the durned fool

Loomis and Kelley ran Duster had jerked the prepared reins from the
cottonwood and was lurching down a small dry gulch with the saddle
bouncing between his belly and the stones

Cutler cast a backward eye at the cabin where Toussaint had stayed
behind alone Head him off below boys and Ill head him off above
the scout sang out He left his companions and quickly circled round
behind the cabin stumbling once heavily and hurrying on anxious lest
the noise had reached the lurking halfbreed But the ivoryhandled
pistol jostled from its holster lay unheeded among the stones where he
had stumbled He advanced over the rough ground came close to the logs
and craftily peered in at the small window in the back of the cabin It
was evident that he had not been heard The sinister figure within still
sat on the table but was crouched listening like an animal to the
shouts that were coming from a safe distance down in the gulch Cutler
outside of the window could not see the face of Toussaint but he saw
one long brown hand sliding up and down the mans leg and its movement
put him in mind of the tail of a cat The hand stopped to pull out a
pistol into which fresh cartridges were slipped Cutler had already
done this same thing after dismounting and he now felt confident that
his weapon needed no further examination He did not put his hand to his
holster The figure rose from the table and crossed the room to a set
of shelves in front of which hung a little yellow curtain Behind it
were cups cans bottles a pistol counters red white and blue and
two fresh packs of cards blue and pink side by side Seeing these
Toussaint drew a handkerchief from his pocket and unwrapped two further
packs both blue and at this Cutlers intent face grew into plain shape
close to the window but receded again into uncertain dimness From down
in the gulch came shouts that the runaway horse was captured Toussaint
listened ran to the door and quickly returning put the blue pack
from the shelf into his pocket leaving in exchange one of his own He
hesitated about altering the position of the cards on the shelf but
Kelley and Loomis were unobservant young men and the halfbreed placed
the pink cards on top of his blue ones The little yellow curtain again
hung innocently over the shelves and Toussaint pouring himself a drink
of whiskey faced round and for the first time saw the window that had
been behind his back He was at it in an instant wrenching its rusty
pin that did not give but stuck motionless in the wood Cursing
he turned and hurried out of the door and round the cabin No one was
there Some hundred yards away the noiseless Cutler crawled farther
among the thickets that filled the head of the gulch Toussaint whipped
out a match and had it against his trousers to strike and look if there
were footprints when second thoughts warned him this might be seen and
was not worth risking suspicion over since so many feet came and went
by this cabin He told himself no one could have been there to see him
and slowly returned inside with a mind that fell a hairs breadth short
of conviction

The boys coming up with the horse met Cutler who listened to how
Duster had stood still as soon as he had kicked free of his saddle
making no objection to being caught They suggested that he would not
have broken loose had he been tied with a rope and hearing this Cutler
bit off a piece of tobacco and told them they were quite right a
horse should never be tied by his bridle For a savory moment the scout
cuddled his secret and turned it over like the tobacco lump under his
tongue Then he explained and received serenely the amazement of Loomis
and Kelley

When you kids have travelled this Western country awhile youll keep
your cards locked said he Hes going to let us win first Youll
see hell play a poor game with the pink deck Then if we dont call
for fresh cards why hell call for em himself But just for the fun
of the thing if any of us loses steady why well call Then when he
gets hold of his strippers watch out When he makes his big play and
is stretchin for to rake the counters in you grab em Joole for by
then Ill have my gun on him and if he makes any trouble well feed him
to the coyotes I expect that must have been it boys he continued in
a new tone as they came within possible earshot of the halfbreed in
the cabin A coyote come around him where he was tied The fool horse
has seen enough of em to git used to em youd think but he dont
There thatll hold him I guess hell have to pull the world along with
him if he starts to run again

The lamp was placed on the windowshelf and the four took seats Cutler
to the left of Toussaint with Kelley opposite The pink cards fell
harmless and for a while the game was a dull one to see Holding a pair
of kings Cutler won a little from Toussaint who remarked that luck
must go with the money of Uncle Sam After a few hands the halfbreed
began to bet with ostentatious folly and losing to one man and
another was joked upon the falling off of his game In an hours time
his blue chips had been twice reinforced and twice melted from the neat
oftencounted pile in which he arranged them moreover he had lost a
horse from his string down on Chug Water

Lend me ten dollar he said to Cutler You rich man now

In the next few deals Kelley became poor Im sick of this luck said
he

Then change it why dont you Lets have a new deck And Loomis rose

Joole you always are for something new said Cutler Now Im doing
pretty well with these pink cards But Im no hog Fetch on your fresh
ones

The eyes of the halfbreed swerved to the yellow curtain He was by
a French trapper from Canada out of a Sioux squaw one of Red Clouds
sisters and his heart beat hot with the evil of two races and none of
their good He was at this moment irrationally angry with the men who
had won from him through his own devices and malice undisguised shone
in his lean flat face At sight of the blue cards falling in the first
deal silence came over the company and from the distant paradeground
the bugle sounded the melancholy strain of taps Faint far solemn
melodious the music travelled unhindered across the empty night

Them men are being checked off in their bunks now said Cutler

What you bet this game demanded Toussaint

Ive heard em play that same music over a soldiers grave said
Kelley

You goin to bet Toussaint repeated

Cutler pushed forward the two necessary white chips No ones hand was
high and Loomis made a slight winning The deal went its round several
times and once when it was Toussaints Cutler suspected that special
cards had been thrown to him by the halfbreed as an experiment He
therefore played the gull to a nicety betting gently upon his three
kings but when he stepped out boldly and bet the limit it was not
Toussaint but Kelley who held the higher hand winning with three aces
Why the coup should be held off longer puzzled the scout unless it was
that Toussaint was carefully testing the edges of his marked cards to
see if he controlled them to a certainty So Cutler played on calmly
Presently two aces came to him in Toussaints deal and he wondered how
many more would be in his threecard draw Very pretty One only and he
lost to Loomis who had drawn three and held four kings The hands
were getting higher they said The game had something to it now But
Toussaint grumbled for his luck was bad all this year he said Cutler
had now made sure that the aces and kings went where the halfbreed
wished and could be slid undetected from the top or the middle or the
bottom of the pack but he had no test yet how far down the scale the
marking went At Toussaints next deal Cutler judged the time had come
and at the second round of betting he knew it The three white men
played their parts raising each other without pause and again there
was total silence in the cabin Every face bent to the table watching
the turn repeat its circle with obstinate increase until new chips and
more new chips had been brought to keep on with and the heap in the
middle had mounted high in the hundreds while in front of Toussaint
lay his knife and a matchboxpledges of two more horses which he had
staked He had drawn three cards while the others took two except
Cutler who had a pair of kings again and drawing three picked up two
more Kelley dropped out remarking he had bet more than his hand was
worth which was true and Loomis followed him Their persistence had
surprised Toussaint a little He had not given every one suspicious
hands Cutlers four kings were enough He bet once more was raised by
the scout called and threw down his four aces

That beats me said Cutler quietly and his hand moved under his
frockcoat as the halfbreed eyeing the central pile of counters in
triumph closed his fingers over it They were dashed off by Kelley who
looked expectantly across at Cutler and seeing the scouts face wither
into sudden old age cried out For Gods sake Jarvis wheres your
gun Kelley sprang for the yellow curtain and reeled backward at the
shot of Toussaint His arm thrashed along the windowsill as he fell
sweeping over the lamp and flaring channels of oil ran over his body
and spread on the ground But these could no longer hurt him The
halfbreed had leaped outside the cabin enraged that Cutler should have
got out during the moment he had been dealing with Kelley The scout was
groping for his ivoryhandled pistol off in the darkness He found
it and hurried to the little window at a second shot he heard inside
Loomis beating the rising flame away had seized the pistol from the
shelf and aimlessly fired into the night at Toussaint He fired again
running to the door from the scorching heat Cutler got round the house
to save him if he could and saw the halfbreeds weapon flash and the
body pitch out across the threshold Toussaint gaining his horse shot
three times and missed Cutler whom he could not clearly see and he
heard the scouts bullets sing past him as his horse bore him rushing
away


II

Jarvis Cutler lifted the dead Loomis out of the cabin He made a try
for Kelleys body but the room had become a cave of flame and he was
driven from the door He wrung his hands giving himself bitter blame
aloud as he covered Loomis with his saddleblanket and jumped bareback
upon Duster to go to the post He had not been riding a minute when
several men met him They had seen the fire from below and on their way
up the halfbreed had passed them at a run

Heres our point said Cutler Will he hide with the Sioux or
will he take to the railroad Well thats my business more than being
wagonmaster Ill get a warrant You tell Lieutenant Balwinand
somebody give me a fresh horse

A short while later as Cutler with the warrant in his pocket rode
out of Fort Laramie the call of the sentinels came across the night
Number One Twelve oclock and alls well A moment and the refrain
sounded more distant given by Number Two When the fourth took it up
far away along the line the words were lost leaving something like the
faint echo of a song The halfbreed had crossed the Platte as if he
were making for his kindred tribe but the scout did not believe in this
too plain trail

Theres Chug Water lying right the other way from where he went and
I guess its there Mr Toussaint is aiming for With this idea Cutler
swung from north to southwest along the Laramie He went slowly over
his shortcut not to leave the widely circling Toussaint too much in his
rear The fugitive would keep himself carefully far on the other side of
the Laramie and very likely not cross it until the forks of Chug Water
Dawn had ceased to be gray and the doves were cooing incessantly among
the river thickets when Cutler reaching the forks found a bottom
where the sagebrush grew seven and eight feet high and buried himself
and his horse in its cover Here was comfort here both rivers could be
safely watched It seemed a good leisuretime for a little fire and some
breakfast He eased his horse of the saddle sliced some bacon and put
a match to his pile of small sticks As the flame caught he stood up to
enjoy the cool of a breeze that was passing through the stillness and
he suddenly stamped his fire out The smell of another fire had come
across Chug Water on the wind It was incredible that Toussaint should
be there already There was no seeing from this bottom and if Cutler
walked up out of it the other man would see too If it were Toussaint
he would not stay long in the vast exposed plain across Chug Water but
would go on after his meal In twenty minutes it would be the thing
to swim or wade the stream and crawl up the mud bank to take a look
Meanwhile Cutler dipped in water some old bread that he had and sucked
it down while the little breeze from opposite hook the cottonwood
leaves and brought over the smell of cooking meat The sun grew warmer
and the doves ceased Cutler opened his big watch and clapped it shut
as the sound of mud heavily slopping into the other river reached
him He crawled to where he could look at the Laramie from among his
sagebrush and there was Toussaint leading his horse down to the water
The halfbreed gave a shrill call and waved his hat His call was
answered and as he crossed the Laramie three Sioux appeared riding to
the bank They waited till he gained their level when all four rode up
the Chug Water and went out of sight opposite the watching Cutler The
scout threw off some of his clothes for the water was still high and
when he had crossed and drawn himself to a level with the plain there
were the four squatted among the sagebrush beside a fire They sat
talking and eating for some time One of them rose at last pointed
south and mounting his horse dwindled to a dot blurred and
evaporated in the heated trembling distance Cutler at the edge of the
bank still watched the other three who sat on the ground A faint shot
came and they rose at once mounted and vanished southward There was
no following them now in this exposed country and Cutler feeling sure
that the signal had meant something about Toussaints horses made his
fire watered his own horse and letting him drag a rope where the feed
was green ate his breakfast in ease Toussaint would get a fresh mount
and proceed to the railroad With the comfort of certainty and tobacco
the scout lolled by the river under the cottonwood and even slept In
the cool of the afternoon he reached the cabin of an acquaintance twenty
miles south and changed his horse A man had passed by he was told
Looked as if bound for Cheyenne No Cutler said hes known there
and he went on watching Toussaints tracks Within ten miles they
veered away from Cheyenne to the southeast and Cutler struck out on a
trail of his own more freely By midnight he was on LodgePole Creek
sleeping sound among the last trees that he would pass He slept
twelve hours having gone to bed knowing he must not come into town
by daylight About nine oclock he arrived and went to the railroad
station there the operator knew him The lowest haunt in the town had
a tent south of the Union Pacific tracks and Cutler getting his irons
and a man from the saloon went there and stepped in covering the room
with his pistol The fiddle stopped the shrieking women scattered and
Toussaint who had a glass in his hand let it fly at Cutlers head for
he was drunk There were two customers besides himself

Nobody shall get hurt here said Cutler above the bedlam that was
now set up Only that mans wanted The quieter I get him the quieter
itll be for others

Toussaint had dived for his pistol but the proprietor of the
dancehall scenting law struck the halfbreed with the butt of
another and he rolled over and was harmless for some minutes Then
he got on his legs and was led out of the entertainment which resumed
more gayly than ever Feet shuffled the fiddle whined and truculent
treble laughter sounded through the canvas walls as Toussaint walked
between Cutler and the saloonman to jail He was duly indicted and
upon the scouts deposition committed to trial for the murder of Loomis
and Kelley Cutler hoping still to be wagonmaster wrote to Lieutenant
Balwin hearing in reply that the reinforcements would not arrive for
two months The session of the court came in one and Cutler was the
Territorys only witness He gave his name and age and hesitated over
his occupation

Call it pokerdealer sneered Toussaints attorney

I would but Im such a fool one observed the witness Put me down
as wagonmaster to the military outfit thats going to White River

What is your residence

Well I reside in the section that lies between the Missouri River and
the Pacific Ocean

A pleasant neighborhood said the judge who knew Cutler perfectly
and precisely how well he could deal poker hands

Its not a pleasant neighborhood for some And Cutler looked at
Toussaint

You think you done with me Toussaint inquired upon which silence was
ordered in the court

Upon Cutlers testimony the halfbreed was found guilty and sentenced
to be hanged in six weeks from that day Hearing this he looked at the
witness I see you one day agin he said

The scout returned to Fort Laramie and soon the expected troops
arrived and the expedition started for White River to join Captain
Brent The captain was stationed there to impress Red Cloud and had
written to headquarters that this chief did not seem impressed very
deeply and that the lives of the settlers were insecure Reinforcements
were accordingly sent to him On the evening before these soldiers left
Laramie news came from the south Toussaint had escaped from jail The
country was full of roving dubious Indians and with the authentic news
went a rumor that the jailer had received various messages These were
to the effect that the Sioux nation did not desire Toussaint to be
killed by the white man that Toussaints mother was the sister of Red
Cloud and that many friends of Toussaint often passed the jailers
house Perhaps he did get such messages They are not a nice sort to
receive However all this may have been the prisoner was gone


III

Fort Robinson on the White River is backed by yellow bluffs that break
out of the foothills in turret and toadstool shapes with stunt pines
starving between their torrid bastions In front of the fort the land
slants away into the flat unfeatured desert and in summer the sky is a
bluesteel covet that each day shuts the sun and the earth and mankind
into one box together while it lifts at night to let in the cool of the
stars The White River which is not wide runs in a curve and around
this curve below the fort some distance was the agency and beyond it
a stockade inside which in those days dwelt the settlers All this was
strung out on one side of the White River outside of the curve and at
a point near the agency a footbridge of two cottonwood trunks crossed
to the concave of the rivers benda bottom of some extent filled with
growing cottonwoods and the tepees of many Sioux families Along the
river and on the plain other tepees stood

One morning after Lieutenant Balwin had become established at Fort
Robinson he was talking with his friend Lieutenant Powell when Cutler
knocked at the wire door The wagonmaster was a privileged character
and he sat down and commented irrelevantly upon the lieutenants
pictures Indian curiosities and other wellmeant attempts to conceal
the walk

Whats the trouble Cutler

Dont know as theres any trouble

Come to your point man youre not a scout now

Toussaints here

What in camp

Hiding with the Sioux Two Knives heard about it Two Knives was a
friendly Indian Hes laying for me Cutler added

Youve seen him

No I want to quit my job and go after him

Nonsense said Powell

You cant Cutler said Balwin I cant spare you

Youll be having to fill my place then I guess

You mean to go without permission said Powell sternly

Lord no Hell shoot me Thats all

The two lieutenants pondered

And its today continued Cutler plaintively that he should be
gettin hanged in Cheyenne

Still the lieutenants pondered while the wagonmaster inspected a
photograph of Marie Rose as Marguerite

I have it exclaimed Powell Lets kill him

How about the commanding officer

Hed back usbut well tell him afterwards Cutler can you find
Toussaint

If I get the time

Very well youre off duty till you do Then report to me at once

Just after guardmounting two days later Cutler came in without
knocking Toussaint was found He was down on the river now beyond the
stockade In ten minutes the wagonmaster and the two lieutenants were
rattling down to the agency in an ambulance behind four tall blue
government mules These were handily driven by a seventeenyearold boy
whom Balwin had picked up liking his sterling American ways He had
come West to be a cowboy but a chance of helping to impress Red Cloud
had seemed still dearer to his heart They drew up at the agency store
and all went in leaving the boy nearly out of his mind with curiosity
and pretending to be absorbed with the reins Presently they came out
Balwin with fieldglasses

Now said he where

You see the stockade sir

Well said Powell sticking his chin on Cutlers shoulder to look
along his arm as he pouted But the scout proposed to be deliberate

Now the gate of the stockade is this way aint it

Well well

You start there and follow the fence to the cornerthe left corner
towards the river Then you follow the side thats nearest the river
down to the other corner Now that corner is about a hundred yards from
the bank You take a beeline to the bank and go down stream maybe
thirty yards No itll be forty yards I guess Theres a lone
pinetree right agin the edge The wagonmaster stopped

I see all that said Lieutenant Balwin screwing the fieldglasses
Theres a buck and a squaw lying under the tree

Naw sir drawled Cutler that aint no buck Thats him lying in his
Injun blanket and chinnin a squaw

Why that mans an Indian Cutler I tell you I can see his braids

Oh hes rigged up Injun fashion fust rate sir But them braids of
his aint hisn False hair

The lieutenants passed each other the fieldglasses three times and
glared at the lone pine and the two figures in blankets The boy on the
ambulance was unable to pretend any longer and leaned off his seat till
he nearly fell

Well said Balwin I never saw anything look more like a buck Sioux
Look at his paint Take the glasses yourself Cutler

But Cutler refused Hes like an Injun he said But thats just what
he wants to be The scouts conviction bore down their doubt

They were persuaded You cant come with us Cutler said Powell You
must wait for us here

I know sir hed spot us sure But it aint right I started this
whole business with my poker scheme at that cabin and I ought to stay
with it clear through

The officers went into the agency store and took down two rifles hanging
at the entrance always ready for use Were going to kill a man they
explained and the owner was entirely satisfied They left the rueful
Cutler inside and proceeded to the gate of the stockade turning there
to the right away from the river and following the paling round the
corner down to the farther righthand corner Looking from behind it
the lone pinetree stood near and plain against the sky The striped
figures lay still in their blankets talking with their faces to the
river Here and there across the stream the smokestained peak of a
tepee showed among the green leaves

Did you ever see a more genuine Indian inquired Baldwin

We must let her rip now anyhow said Powell and they stepped out
into the open They walked towards the pine till it was a hundred yards
from them and the two beneath it lay talking all the while Balwin
covered the man with his rifle and called The man turned his head and
seeing the rifle sat up in his blanket The squaw sat up also Again
the officer called keeping his rifle steadily pointed and the man
dived like a frog over the bank Like magic his blanket had left his
limbs and painted body naked except for the breechclout Balwins
tardy bullet threw earth over the squaw who went flapping and
screeching down the river Balwin and Powell ran to the edge which
dropped six abrupt feet of clay to a trail then shelved into the swift
little stream The red figure was making up the trail to the footbridge
that led to the Indian houses and both officers fired The man
continued his limber flight and they jumped down and followed firing
They heard a yell on the plain above and an answer to it and then
confused yells above and below gathering all the while The figure ran
on above the river trail below the bank and their bullets whizzed after
it

Indian asserted Balwin panting

Ran away though said Powell

Sod you run Think any Siouxd stay when an army officer comes gunning
for him

Shoot said Powell S getting near bridge and they went on
running and firing The yells all over the plain were thickening The
air seemed like a substance of solid flashing sound The naked runner
came round the river curve into view of the people at the agency store

Wheres a rifle said Cutler to the agent

Officers got em the agent explained

Well I cant stand this said the scout and away he went

That mans crazy said the agent

You bet he aint remarked the ambulance boy

Cutler was much nearer to the bridge than was the man in the
breechclout and reaching the bank he took half a minutes keen
pleasure in watching the race come up the trail When the figure
was within ten yards Cutler slowly drew an ivoryhandled pistol The
lieutenants below saw the man leap to the middle of the bridge sway
suddenly with arms thrown up and topple into White River The current
swept the body down and as it came it alternately lifted and turned and
sank as the stream played with it Sometimes it struck submerged stumps
or shallows and bounded half out of water then drew under with nothing
but the back of the head in sight turning round and round The din of
Indians increased and from the tepees in the cottonwoods the red Sioux
began to boil swarming on the opposite bank but uncertain what had
happened The man rolling in the water was close to the officers

Its not our man said Balwin Did you or I hit him

Were gone anyhow said Powell quietly Look

A dozen rifles were pointing at their heads on the bank above The
Indians still hesitated for there was Two Knives telling them these
officers were not enemies and had hurt no Sioux Suddenly Cutler pushed
among the rifles dashing up the nearest two with his arm and their
explosion rang in the ears of the lieutenants Powell stood grinning at
the general complication of matters that had passed beyond his control
and Balwin made a grab as the head of the man in the river washed by
The false braid came off in his hand

Quick shouted Cutler from the bank Shove him up here

Two Knives redoubled his harangue and the Indians stood puzzled while
the lieutenants pulled Toussaint out not dead but shot through the
hip They dragged him over the clay and hoisted him till Cutler caught
hold and jerked him to the level as a new noise of rattling descended
on the crowd and the four blue mules wheeled up and halted The boy had
done it himself Massing the officers need he had pelted down among
the Sioux heedless of their yells and keeping his gray eyes on his
team In got the three pushing Toussaint in front and scoured away for
the post as the squaw arrived to shriek the truth to her tribewhat Red
Clouds relation had been the victim

Cutler sat smiling as the ambulance swung along I told you I belonged
in this here affair he said And when they reached the fort he was
saying it still occasionally

Captain Brent considered it neatly done But that boy put the finishing
touches he said Lets have him in

The boy was had in and ate a dinner with the officers in glum
embarrassment smoking a cigar after it without joy Toussaint was given
into the doctors hands and his wounds carefully dressed

This will probably cost an Indian outbreak said Captain Brent
looking down at the plain Blanketed riders galloped over it and
yelling filled the air But Toussaint was not destined to cause this
further harm An unexpected influence intervened

All afternoon the cries and galloping went on and next morning worse
sign there seemed to be no Indians in the world The horizon was
empty the air was silent the smoking tepees were vanished from the
cottonwoods and where those in the plain had been lay the lodgepoles
and the fires were circles of white cold ashes By noon an interpreter
came from Red Cloud Red Cloud would like to have Toussaint If the
white man was not willing it should be war

Captain Brent told the story of Loomis and Kelley Say to Red Cloud
he ended that when a white man does such things among us he is
killed Ask Red Cloud if Toussaint should live If he thinks yes let
him come and take Toussaint

The next day with ceremony and feathers of state Red Cloud came
bringing his interpreter and after listening until every word had been
told him again requested to see the halfbreed He was taken to the
hospital A sentry stood on post outside the tent and inside lay
Toussaint with whom Cutler and the ambulanceboy were playing
whiskeypoker While the patient was waiting to be hanged he might as
well enjoy himself within reason Such was Cutlers frontier philosophy
We should always do what we can for the sick At sight of Red Cloud
looming in the doorway gorgeous and grim as Fate the game was
suspended The Indian took no notice of the white men and walked to the
bed Toussaint clutched at his relations fringe but Red Cloud looked
at him Then the mongrel strain of blood told and the halfbreed poured
out a chattering appeal while Red Cloud by the bedside waited till it
had spent itself Then he grunted and left the room He had not spoken
and his crest of long feathers as it turned the corner was the last
vision of him that the cardplayers had

Red Cloud came back to the officers and in their presence formally
spoke to his interpreter who delivered the message Red Cloud says
Toussaint heap no good No Injun anyhow He not want him White man
hunt pretty hard for him Can keep him

Thus was Toussaint twice sentenced He improved under treatment played
many games of whiskeypoker and was conveyed to Cheyenne and hanged

These things happened in the early seventies but there are Sioux
still living who remember the two lieutenants and how they pulled the
halfbreed out of White River by his false hair It makes them laugh to
this day Almost any Indian is full of talk when he chooses and when he
gets hold of a joke he never lets go




Sharons Choice


Under Providence a man may achieve the making of many thingsships

But he had reckoned without the inhabitants to say nothing of nature

prejudices they asked me to serve with the telegraphoperator and the
ticketagent and the hotelmanager on the literary committee of
judges at the school festival There would be a stage and flags
and elocution and parents assembled and afterwards icecream with
strawberries from El Paso

Have you ever awarded prizes for school speaking inquired the
telegraphoperator Stuart

Yes I told him At Concord in New Hampshire

Ever have a chat afterwards with a mother whose girl did not get the
prize

It was boys I replied And parents had no say in it

Its boys and girls in Sharon said he Parents have no say in it
here either But that dont seem to occur to them at the moment Well
all stick together of course

I think I had best resign said I You would find me no hand at
pacifying a mother

There are fathers also said Stuart But individual parents are small
trouble compared with a big split in public opinion Weve missed that
so far though

Then why have judges Why not a popular vote I inquired

Dont go back on us said Stuart We are so few here And you know
education cant be democratic or where will good taste find itself
Eastman knows that much at least And Stuart explained that Eastman
was the head of the school and chairman of our committee He is from
Massachusetts and his taste is good but he is total abstinence Wont
allow any literature with the least smell of a drink in it not even
in the singingclass Would not have Heres a health to King Charles
inside the door Narrowing that as many of the finest classics speak
of wine freely Eastman is useful but a crank Now take Lochinvar
We are to have it on strawberry night but say Eastman kicked about it
Told the kid to speak something else Kid came to me and I

A smile lurked for one instant in the corner of Stuarts eye and
disappeared again Then he drew his arm through mine as we walked

You have never seen anything in your days like Sharon said he You
could not sit down by yourself and make such a thing up Shakespeare
might have but he would have strained himself doing it Well Eastman
says Lochinvar will go in my expurgated version Too bad Sir Walter
cannot know Ever read his Familiar Letters Great grief but he was a
good man Eastman stuck about that mention of wine Remember

 So now am I come with this lost love of mine
 To lead but one measure drink one cup of wine

Well thought I Eastman would agree to water Water and daughter
would go but is frequently used and spoils the meter So I fiddled
with my pencil down in the telegraph office and I fixed the thing up
Hows this

 So now am I come with this beautiful maid
 To lead but one measure drink one lemonade

Eastman accepts that Says its purer Oh its not all sadness here

How did you come to be in Sharon I asked my exotic acquaintance

Ah how did I How did all our crowd at the railroad Somebody has got
to sell tickets somebody has got to run that hotel and telegraphs have
got to exist here Thats how we foreigners came Many travellers change
cars here and one train usually misses the other because the two
companies do not love each other You hear lots of language especially
in December Eastern consumptives bound for southern California get left
here and drummers are also thick Remarks range from How provoking
to things I would not even say myself So that big hotel and depot has
to be kept running and we fellows get a laugh now and then Our lot is
better than these peoples He made a general gesture at Sharon

I should have thought it was worse said I No for well be
transferred some day These poor folks are shipwrecked Though it is
their own foolishness all this

Again my eye followed as he indicated the town with a sweep of his hand
and from the town I looked to the four quarters of heaven I may have
seen across into Old Mexico No sign labels the boundary the vacuum
of continent goes on you might think to Patagonia Symptoms of
neighboring Mexico basked on the sand heaps along Sharons spacious
avenueslittle torpid indecent gnomes in sashes and open rags with
crowningsteeple straw hats and murder dozing in their small black
eyes They might have crawled from holes in the sand or hatched out
of brown cracked pods on some weeds that trailed through the broken
bottles the old shoes and the wire fences Outside these ramparts
began the vacuum white gray indigo florescent where all the year
the sun shines Not the semblance of any tree dances in the heat only
rocks and lumps of higher sand waver and dissolve and reappear in the
shaking crystal of mirage Not the scar of any riverbed furrows the
void A river there is flowing somewhere out of the shiny violet
mountains to the north but it dies subterraneously on its way to
Sharon misses the town and emerges thirty miles south across the
sunlight in a shallow futile lake a cienaga called Las Palomas Then
it evaporates into the ceaseless blue sky

The water you get in Sharon is dragged by a herd of windwheels from
the bowels of the sand Over the town they turn and turnSharons upper
storya filmy colony of slats In some of the homes beneath them you
may go upstairsin the American homes not in the adobe Mexican
caves of song woman and knives and brick and stone edifices occur
Monuments of perished trade these rise among their flatter neighbors
cubical and stark undershirts firearms and groceries for sale
in the groundfloor blind dustwindows above Most of the mansions
however squat ephemerally upon the soil no cellar to them and no
staircase the total fragile box ready to bounce and caracole should the
wind drive hard enough Inside them eating mending the newspaper and
more babies eke out the twelvemonth outside the citizens loiter to
their errands along the brief wide avenues of Sharon that empty into
space Men women and children move about in the town sparse and
casual and over their heads in a white tribe the windwheels on their
rudders veer to the breeze and indolently revolve above the gaping
obsoleteness Through the dumb town the locomotive bell tolls
pervadingly when a train of freight or passengers trundles in from the
horizon or out along the dwindling fence of telegraph poles No matter
where you are you can hear it come and go leaving Sharon behind an
airy carcass bleached and ventilated sitting on the sand with the sun
and the hot wind pouring through its bones

This town was the magnates child the thing that was to keep his memory
green and as I took it in on that first walk of discovery Stuart told
me its story how the magnate had decreed the railroad shops should be
here how at that corner lots grew in a night how horsemen galloped
the streets shooting for joy and the hasty tents rose while the
houses were hammered together how they had song dance cards whiskey
license murder marriage operathe whole usual thingregular as the
clock in our West in Australia in Africa in every virgin corner
of the world where the AngloSaxon rushes to spend his animal
spiritsregular as the clock and in Sharons case about fifteen
minutes long For they became greedy the cornerlot people They ran
up prices for land which the railroad the breath of their nostrils
wanted They grew ugly forgetting they were dealing with a magnate and
that a railroad from ocean to ocean can take its shops somewhere else
with appalling ease Thus did the corner lots become sand again in a
night And in the words of the poet concluded Stuart Sharon has an
immense future behind it

Our talk was changed by the sight of a lady leaning and calling over a
fence

Mrs Jeffries said she Oh Mrs Jeffries

Well called a voice next door

I want to send Leola and Arvasita into your yard

Well the voice repeated

Our toolhouse blew over into your yard last night Its jammed behind
your tank

Oh indeed

A window in the next house was opened a head put out and this
occasioned my presentation to both ladies They were Mrs Mattern
and Mrs Jeffries and they fell instantly into a stiff caution of
deportment but they speedily found I was not worth being cautious
over Stuart whispered to me that they were widows of high standing and
mothers of competing favorites for the elocution prize and I hastened
to court their esteem Mrs Mattern was in body more ample standing
high and yellow and fluffy but Mrs Jeffries was smooth and small and
behind her spectacles she had an eye

You must not let us interrupt you ladies said I after some
civilities Did I understand that something was to be carried
somewhere

You did said Mrs Jeffries she had come out of her house and I am
pleased to notice no damage has been done to our fencethis time

It would have been fixed right up at my expense as always Mrs
Jeffries retorted her neighbor and started to keep abreast of Mrs
Jeffries as that lady walked and inspected the fence Thus the two
marched parallel along the frontier to the rear of their respective
territories

Youll not resign said Stuart to me It is yours till death aint
it

I told him that it was

About once a month I can expect this said Mrs Jeffries returning
along her frontier

Well its not the only case in Sharon Mrs Jeffries said Mrs
Mattern Ill remind you of them three coops when you kept poultry and
they got away across the railroad along with the barbers shop

But cannot we help you get it out said I with a zealous wish for
peace

You are very accommodating sir said Mrs Mattern

One of the prizeawarding committee said Stuart An elegant judge of
oratory Has decided many contests at Concord the home of Emerson

Concord New Hampshire I corrected but neither lady heard me

How splendid for Leola cried Mrs Mattern instantly Leola Oh
Leola Come right out here

Mrs Jeffries has been more prompt She was already in her house and
now came from it bringing a pleasantlooking boy of sixteen it
might be The youth grinned at me as he stood awkwardly brought in
shirtsleeves from the performance of some household work

This is Guy said his mother Guy took the prize last year Guy
hopes

Shut up mother said Guy with entire sweetness I dont hope
twice

Twice or a dozen times should raise no hard feelings if my son is
Sharons best speaker cried Mrs Jeffries and looked across the fence
viciously

Shut up mother I aint said Guy

He is a master of humor recitations his mother now said to me
Perhaps you know or perhaps you do not know how high up that is
reckoned

Why mother Leola can speak all around me She can Guy added to me
nodding his head confidentially

I did not believe him I think because I preferred his name to that of
Leola

Leola will study in Paris France announced Mrs Mattern arriving
with her child She has no advantages here This is the gentleman
Leola

But before I had more than noted a darkeyed maiden who would not look
at me but stood in skirts too young for her figure black stockings
and a dangle of hair that should have been up her large parent had
thrust into my hand a scrapbook

Here is what the Santa Fe Observer says and when I would have read
she read aloud for me The next is the Los Angeles Christian Home And
heres what they wrote about her in El Paso Her histrionic genius for
one so youngit commences below that picture Thats Leola I now
recognized the black stockings and the hair Heres what a literary
lady in Lordsburg thinks pursued Mrs Mattern

Never mind that murmured Leola

I shall And the mother read the letter to me Leola has spoke in
five cultured cities she went on Arvasita can depict how she was
encored at Albuquerque last EasterMonday

Yes sir three recalls said Arvasita arriving at our group by the
fence An elder sister she was evidently Are you acquainted with
Camill she asked me with a trifle of sternness and upon my
hesitating the celebrated French drayma of Camill she repeated
with a trifle more of sternness Camill is the lady in it who dies of
consumption Leola recites the letterandcoughing scene Act Third Mr
Patterson of Coloraydo Springs pronounces it superior to Modjeska

That is Leola again said Mrs Mattern showing me another newspaper
cuthair stockings and a candle this time

Sleepwalking scene Macbeth said Arvasita Leolas great night
at the church fair and bazar El Paso in Shakespeares acknowledged
masterpiece Leolas repetwar likewise includes Catherine the Queen
before her Judges Quality of Mercy is not Strained Death of Little
Nell Death of Paul Dombey Death of the Old Year Burial of Sir
John Moore and other standard gems suitable for ladies

Leola said her mother recite When the British Warrior Queen to
the gentleman

No momma please not said Leola and her voice made me look at her
something of appeal sounded in it

Leola is that young you must excuse her said her motherand I
thought the girl winced

Come away Guy suddenly snapped little Mrs Jeffries We are wasting
the gentlemans time You are no infant prodigy and we have no pictures
of your calves to show him in the papers

Why mother cried the boy and he gave a brotherly look to Leola

But the girl scarlet and upset now ran inside the house

As for wasting time madam said I with indignation you are wasting
yours in attempting to prejudice the judges

There said Guy

And Mrs Mattern continued if I may say so without offense
the age real or imaginary of the speakers may make a difference in
Albuquerque but with our committee not the slightest

Thank you Im sure said Mrs Mattern bridling

Eastern ideas are ever welcome in Sharon said Mrs Jeffries
Goodmorning And she removed Guy and herself into her house while
Mrs Mattern and Arvasita stiffly ignoring me passed into their own
door

Come have a drink said Stuart to me I am glad you said it Old
Mother Mattern will let down those prodigy skirts The poor girl has
been ashamed of them these two years but momma has bulldozed her into
staying young for stage effect The girls not conceited for a wonder
and she speaks well It is even betting which of the two widows you have
made the maddest

Close by the saloon we were impeded by a rush of small boys They ran
before and behind us suddenly from barrels and unforeseen places and
wedging and bumping between us they shouted Chickenlegs Ah look at
the chickenlegs

For a sensitive moment I feared they were speaking of me but the
folding slatdoors of the saloon burst open outward and a giant
barkeeper came among the boys and caught and shook them to silence

You want to behave was his single remark and they dispersed like a
Sundayschool

I did not see why they should thus describe him He stood and nodded to
us and jerked big thumb towards the departing flock Funny how a boy
will never think said he with amiability But theyll grow up to be
about as good as the rest of us I guess Dont you let them monkey with
you Josey he called

Naw I wont said a voice I turned and saw by a barrel a youth in
kneebreeches glowering down the street at his routed enemies He
was possibly eight and one hand was bound in a grimy rag This was
Chickenlegs

Did they harm you Josey asked the giant

Naw they didnt

Not troubled your hand any

Naw they didnt

Well dont you let them touch you Well see you through And as
we followed him in towards our drink through his folding slatdoors he
continued discoursing to me the newcomer I am against interfering
with kids I like to leave em fight and fool just as much as they see
fit Now them boys aint malicious but theyre young you see theyre
young and misfortune dont appeal to them Josey lost his father last
spring and his mother died last month Last week he played with a
freight car and left two of his fingers with it Now you might think
that was enough hardship

Indeed yes I answered

But the little stake he inherited was gambled away by his stinking old
aunt

Well I cried

So were seeing him through

You bet said a citizen in boots and pistol who was playing
billiards

This town is not going to permit any man to fool with Josey stated
his opponent in the game

Or women either added a lounger by the bar shaggybearded and also
with a pistol

Mr Abe Hanson said the barkeeper presenting me to him Joseys
fathers partner Hes took the boy from the aunt and is going to see
him through

How r ye said Mr Hanson hoarsely and without enthusiasm

A member of the prizeawarding committee explained Stuart and waved
a hand at me

They all brightened up and came round me

Heard my boy speak inquired one Reub Gadsdens his name

I told him I had heard no speaker thus far and I mentioned Leola and
Guy

Hope the boyll give us The Jumping Frog again said one I near
bust

Whats the heifer speakin this trip another inquired

Huh Her said a third

Youll talk different maybe this time retorted the other

Not agin The Jumping Frog he wont the first insisted I near
bust he repeated

Id like for you to know my boy Reub said Mr Gadsden to me
insinuatingly

Quit fixing the judge Al said Leolas backer Reub forgets his
words an says em over an balks an mires down an backs out an
starts fresh en its confusin to foller him

Im glad to see you take so much interest gentlemen said I

Yes were apt to see it through said the barkeeper And Stuart and I
bade them a goodmorning

As we neared the schoolmasters house where Stuart was next taking me
we came again upon the boys with Josey and no barkeeper at hand to see
him through But Josey made it needless At the word Chickenlegs he
flew in a limber manner upon the nearest and knocking him immediately
flat turned with spirit upon a second and kicked him At this they set
up a screeching and fell all together and the schoolmaster came out of
his door

Boys boys said he And the Sabbath too

As this did not immediately affect them Mr Eastman made a charge and
they fled from him then A long stocking of Joseys was torn and hung
in two streamers round his ankles and his dangling shoelaces were
trodden to fringe

If you want your hand to get well for strawberry night began Mr
Eastman

Ah bother strawberry night said Josey and hopped at one of his
playmates But Mr Eastman caught him skilfully by the collar

I am glad his misfortunes have not crushed him altogether said I

Josey Yeatts is an anxious case sir returned the teacher Several
influences threaten his welfare Yesterday I found tobacco on him
Chewing sir

Just you hurt me said Josey and Ill tell Abe

Abe exclaimed Mr Eastman lifting his brow He means a man old
enough to be his father sir I endeavor to instill him with some few
notions of respect but the town spoils him Indulges him completely I
may say And when Sharons sympathies are stirred sir it will espouse a
cause very warmlyGive me that broke off the schoolmaster and there
followed a brief wrestle Chewing again today sir he added to me

Abe lemme have it shrieked Josey Lemme go or hell come over and
fix you

But the calm chilly Eastman had ground the tobacco under his heel You
can understand how my hands are tied he said to me

Readily I answered

The men give Josey his way in everything He has aI may say an
unworthy aunt

Yes said I So I have gathered

At this point Josey ducked and slid free and the united flock vanished
with jeers at us Josey forgot they had insulted him they forgot he had
beaten them against a common enemy was their friendship cemented

You spoke of Sharons warm way of espousing causes said I to Eastman

I did sir No one could live here long without noticing it

Sharon is a quiet town but sudden remarked Stuart Apt to be
sudden Theyre beginning about strawberry night he said to Eastman
Wanted to know about things down in the saloon

How does their taste in elocution chiefly lie I inquired

Eastman smiled He was young totally bald the moral dome of his skull
rising white above visionary eyes and a serious auburn beard He
was clothed in a bleak smooth slategray suit and at any climax of
emphasis he lifted slightly upon his toes and relaxed again shutting
his lips tight on the finished sentence Your question said he has
often perplexed me Sometimes they seem to prefer verse sometimes prose
stirs them greatly We shall have a liberal crop of both this year I am
proud to tell you I have augmented our number of strawberry speakers by
nearly fifty per cent

How many will there be said I

Eleven You might wish some could be excused But I let them speak to
stimulate their interest in culture Will you not take dinner with me
gentlemen I was just sitting down when little Josey Yeatts brought me
out

We were glad to do this and he opened another can of corned beef for
us I cannot offer you wine sir said he to me though I am aware it
is a general habit in luxurious homes And he tightened his lips

General habit wherever they dont prefer whiskey said Stuart

I fear so the schoolmaster replied smiling That poison shall
never enter my house gentlemen any more than tobacco And as I cannot
reform the adults of Sharon I am doing what I can for their children
Little Hugh Straight is going to say his Lochinvar very pleasingly
Mr Stuart I went over it with him last night I like them to be word
perfect he continued to me as failures on exhibition night elicit
unfavorable comment

And are we to expect failures also I inquired

Reuben Gadsden is likely to mortify us He is an earnest boy but
nervous and one or two others But I have limited their length Reuben
Gadsdens father declined to have his boy cut short and he will give
us a speech of Burkes but I hope for the best It narrows down it
narrows down Guy Jeffries and Leola Mattern are the two

The parents seem to take keen interest said I

Mr Eastman smiled at Stuart We have no reason to suppose they have
changed since last year said he Why sir he suddenly exclaimed
if I did not feel I was doing something for the young generation
here I should leave Sharon tomorrow One is not appreciated not
appreciated

He spoke fervently of various local enterprises his failures his
hopes his achievements and I left his house honoring him but
amazedhis heart was so wide and his head so narrow a man who would
purify with simultaneous austerity the morals of Lochinvar and of
Sharon

About once a month said Stuart I run against a new side he is blind
on Take his puzzlement as to whether they prefer verse or prose Queer
and dumb of him that you see Sharon does not know the difference
between verse and prose

Thats going too far said I

They dont he repeated when it comes to strawberry night If the
piece is about something they understand rhymes do not help or hinder
And of course sex is apt to settle the question

Then I should have thought Leola I began

Not the sex of the speaker Its the listeners Now you take women
Women generally prefer something that will give them a good cry We men
want to laugh mostly

Yes said I I would rather laugh myself I think

Youd know youd rather if you had to live in Sharon The laugh is one
of the big differences between women and men and I would give you my
views about it only my Sundayoff time is up and Ive got to go to
telegraphing

Our ways are together said I Im going back to the railroad hotel

Theres Guy continued Stuart He took the prize on The Jumping
Frog Spoke better than Leola anyhow She spoke The Wreck of
the Hesperus But Guy had the back benchesthats where the men
sitpretty well useless Guess if there had been a fire some of
the fellows would have been scorched before theyd have got strength
sufficient to run out But the ladies did not laugh much Said they saw
nothing much in jumping a frog And if Leola had made em cry good and
hard that night the committees decision would have kicked up more of a
fuss than it did As it was Mrs Mattern got me alone but I worked us
around to where Mrs Jeffries was having her icecream and I left them
to argue it out

Let us adhere to that policy I said to Stuart and he replied
nothing but into the corner of his eye wandered that lurking smile
which revealed that life brought him compensations

He went to telegraphing and I to revery concerning strawberry night
I found myself wishing now that there could have been two prizes I
desired both Leola and Guy to be happy and presently I found the matter
would be very close so far at least as my judgment went For boy and
girl both brought me their selections begging I would coach them and
this I had plenty of leisure to do I preferred Guys choicethe story
of that bluejay who dropped nuts through the hole in a roof expecting
to fill it and his friends came to look on and discovered the hole went
into the entire house It is better even than The Jumping Frogbetter
than anything I thinkand young Guy told it well But Leola brought a
potent rival on the tearful side of things The Death of Paul Dombey
is plated pathos not wholly sterling but Sharon could not know this
and while Leola most prettily recited it to me I would lose my recent
opinion in favor of Guy and acknowledge the value of her performance
Guy might have the men strong for him but this time the women were
going to cry I got also a certain other sort of entertainment out of
the competing mothers Mrs Jeffries and Mrs Mattern had a way of being
in the hotel office at hours when I passed through to meals They never
came together and always were taken by surprise at meeting me

Leola is ever so grateful to you Mrs Mattern would say

Oh I would answer do not speak of it Have you ever heard Guys
BlueJay story

Well if its anything like that frog business I dont want to And
the lady would leave me

Guy tells me you are helping him so kindly said Mrs Jeffries

Oh yes Im severe I answered brightly I let nothing pass I only
wish I was as careful with Leola But as soon as she begins Paul had
never risen from his little bed I just lose myself listening to her

On the whole there were also compensations for me in these mothers and
I thought it as well to secure them in advance

When the train arrived from El Paso and I saw our strawberries and our
icecream taken out I felt the hour to be at hand and that whatever
our decision no bias could be laid to me According to his prudent
habit Eastman had the speakers follow each other alphabetically This
happened to place Leola after Guy and perhaps might give her the last
word as it were with the people but our committee was there and
superior to such accidents The flags and the bunting hung gay around
the draped stage While the audience rustled or resoundingly trod to
its chairs and seated neighbors conferred solemnly together over the
programme Stuart behind the bunting played Silver Threads among the
Gold upon a melodeon

Pretty good this he said to me pumping his feet

What I said

Tune Sharon is for free silver

Do you think they will catch your allusion I asked him

No But I have a way of enjoying a thing by myself And he pumped
away playing with tasteful variations until the hall was full and the
singingclass assembled in gloves and ribbons

They opened the ceremonies for us by rendering Sweet and Low very
happily and I trusted it was an omen

Sharon was hearty and we had Sweet and Low twice Then the speaking
began and the speakers were welcomed coming and going with mild and
friendly demonstrations Nothing that one would especially mark went
wrong until Reuben Gadsden He strode to the middle of the boards and
they creaked beneath his tread He stood a moment in large glittering
boots and with hair flat and prominently watered As he straightened
from his bow his suspenderbuttons came into view and remained so for
some singular internal reason while he sent his right hand down into
the nearest pocket and began his oratory

It is sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of France he
said impressively and stopped

We waited and presently he resumed

It is sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of France He
took the right hand out and put the left hand in

It is sixteen or seventeen years said he and stared frowning at his
boots

I found the silence was getting on my nerves I felt as if it were
myself who was drifting to idiocy and tremulous empty sensations began
to occur in my stomach Had I been able to recall the next sentence I
should have prompted him

It is sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of France said
the orator rapidly

And down deep back among the men came a voice Well I guess it must
be Reub

This snapped the tension I saw Reubens boots march away Mr Eastman
came from behind the bunting and spoke I suppose words of protest I
could not hear them but in a minute or perhaps two we grew calm and
the speaking continued

There was no question what they thought of Guy and Leola He conquered
the back of the room They called his name they blessed him with
endearing audible oaths and even the ladies smiled at his pleasant
honest facethe ladies except Mrs Mattern She sat near Mrs
Jeffries and throughout Guys BlueJay fanned herself exhibiting a
wellsustained inattention She might have foreseen that Mrs Jeffries
would have her turn When the Death of Paul Dombey came and
handkerchiefs began to twinkle out among the audience and various
noises of grief were rising around us and the men themselves murmured
in sympathy Mrs Jeffries not only preserved a suppressedhilarity
countenance but managed to cough twice with a cough that visibly bit
into Mrs Matterns soul

But Leolas appealing cadences moved me also When Paul was dead
she made her pretty little bow and we sat spellbound then gave her
applause surpassing Guys Unexpectedly I found embarrassment of choice
dazing me and I sat without attending to the later speakers Was not
successful humor more difficult than pathos Were not tears more cheaply
raised than laughter Yet on the other hand Guy had one prize and
where merit was so evenI sat I say forgetful of the rest of the
speakers when suddenly I was aware of louder shouts of welcome and I
awaked to Josey Yeatts bowing at us

Spit it out Josey a large encouraging voice was crying in the back
of the hall Well see you through

Dont be scared Josey yelled another

Then Josey opened his mouth and rhythmically rattled the following

I love little pussy her coat is so warm And if I dont hurt her shell
do me no harm Ill sit by the fiyer and give her some food And pussy
will love me because I am good

That was all It had come without falter or pause even for breath
Josey stood and the room rose to him

Again again they roared He aint a bit scared Go it Josey
You dont forgit yer piece And a great deal more while they pounded
with their boots

I love little pussy began Josey

Poor darling said a lady next me No mother

Ill sit by the fiyer

Josey was continuing But nobody heard him finish The room was a Babel

Look at his little hand Only three fingers inside them rags
Nobody to mend his clothes any more They all talked to each other
and clapped and cheered while Josey stood one leg slightly advanced
and proudly stiff somewhat after the manner of those military
engravings where some general is seen erect upon an eminence at the
moment of victory

Mr Eastman again appeared from the bunting and was telling us I have
no doubt something of importance but the giant barkeeper now shouted
above the din Who says Josey Yeatts aint the speaker for this night

At that striking of the common chord I saw them heave promiscuous and
unanimous up the steps to the stage Josey was set upon Abe Hansons
shoulder while ladies wept around him What the literary committee
might have done I do not know for we had not the time even to resign
Guy and Leola now appeared bearing the prize between thema picture of
Washington handing the Bible out of clouds to Abraham Lincolnand very
immediately I found myself part of a procession Men and women we were
marching about Sharon The barkeeper led four of Sharons fathers
followed him escorting Josey borne aloft on Abe Hansons shoulder
and rigid and military in his bearing Leola and Guy followed with the
picture Stuart walked with me whistling melodies of the warDixie
and others Eastman was not with us When the ladies found themselves
conducted to the saloon they discreetly withdrew back to the
entertainment we had broken out from Josey saw them go and shrilly
spoke his first word

Aint I going to have any icecream

This presently caused us to return to the ladies and we finished the
evening with entire unity of sentiment Eastman alone took the incident
to heart inquired how he was to accomplish anything with hands tied
and murmured his constant burden once more One is not appreciated not
appreciated

I do not stop over in Sharon any more My ranch friend whose presence
there brought me to visit him is gone away But such was my virgin
experience of the place and in later days fate led me to be concerned
with two more local competitionsone military and one civilwhich
greatly stirred the population So that I never pass Sharon on my long
travels without affectionately surveying the sandy quivering bleached
town unshaded by its twinkling forest of windwheels Surely the heart
always remembers a spot where it has been merry And one thing I should
like to knowshall know perhaps what sort of citizen in our republic
Josey will grow to be For whom will he vote May he not himself come to
sit in Washington and make laws for us Universal suffrage holds so many
possibilities




Napoleon ShaveTail


Augustus Albumblatt young and new and sleek with the latest
bookknowledge of war reported to his first troop commander at Fort
Brown The ladies had watched for him because he would increase the
number of men the officers because he would lessen the number of
duties and he joined at a crisis favorable to becoming speedily known
by them all Upon that same day had household servants become an
extinct race The last one the commanding officers cook had told the
commanding officers wife that she was used to living where she could
see the cars She added that there was no society here fit for man or
baste at all This opinion was formed on the preceding afternoon when
Casey a sergeant of roguish attractions in G troop had told her that
he was not a marrying man Three hours later she wedded a gambler
and this morning at six they had taken the stage for Green River two
hundred miles south the nearest point where the bride could see the
cars

Frank said the commanding officers wife send over to H troop for
York

Catherine he answered my dear our statesmen at Washington say
its wicked to hire the free American soldier to cook for you Its too
menial for his manhood

Frank stuff

Hush my love Therefore York must be spared the insult of twenty
more dollars a month our statesmen must be reelected and you and I
Catherine being cookless must join the general mess

Thus did all separate housekeeping end and the garrison began unitedly
to eat three times a day what a Chinaman set before them when the
longexpected Albumblatt stepped into their midst just in time for
supper

This youth was spicandspan from the Military Academy with a
topdressing of three months thoughtful travel in Germany I was
deeply impressed with the modernity of their scientific attitude he
pleasantly remarked to the commanding officer For Captain Duane silent
usually talked at this first meal to make the boy welcome in this
forlorn twocompany post

Were cut off from all that sort of thing here said he Ive not
been east of the Missouri since 69 But weve got the railroad across
and weve killed some Indians and weve had some fun and were glad
were aliveeh Mrs Starr

I should think so said the lady

Especially now weve got a bachelor at the post said Mrs Bainbridge
That has been the one drawback Mr Albumblatt

I thank you for the compliment said Augustus bending solemnly from
his hips and Mrs Starr looked at him and then at Mrs Bainbridge

Were not overgay I fear the Captain continued but the flats
full of antelope and theres good shooting up both canyons

Have you followed the recent target experiments at Metz inquired
the traveller I refer to the flattened trajectory and the obus
controversy

We have not heard the reports answered the commandant with becoming
gravity But we own a mountain howitzer

The modernity of German ordnance began Augustus

Do you dance Mr Albumblatt asked Mrs Starr

For well have a hop and all be your partners Mrs Bainbridge
exclaimed

I will be pleased to accommodate you ladies

Its anything for varietys sake with us you see said Mrs Starr
smoothly smiling and once again Augustus bent blandly from his hips

But the commanding officer wished leniency You see us all he
hastened to say Commissioned officers and dancingmen Pretty
shabby

Oh Captain said a lady

And pretty old

Captain said another lady

But alive and kicking Captain Starr Mr Bainbridge the Doctor and
me We are seven

Augustus looked accurately about him Do I understand seven Captain

We are seven the senior officer repeated

Again Mr Albumblatt counted heads I imagine you include the ladies
Captain Ha ha

Seven commissioned males sir Our Major is on sickleave and two of
our Lieutenants are related to the Presidents wife She cant bear them
to be exposed None of us in the churchyard liebut we are seven

Ha ha Captain Thats an elegant double entendre on Wordsworths
poem and the War Department Only if I may correct your additionha
haour total including myself is eight And Augustus grew as
hilarious as a wooden nutmeg

The commanding officer rolled an intimate eye at his wife

The lady was sitting big with rage but her words were cordial still
Indeed Mr Albumblatt the way officers who have influence in
Washington shirk duty here and get details East is something I
cant laugh about At one time the Captain was his own adjutant and
quartermaster There are more officers at this table tonight than
Ive seen in three years So we are doubly glad to welcome you at Fort
Brown

I am fortunate to be on duty where my services are so required though
I could object to calling it Fort Brown And Augustus exhaled a new
smile

Prefer Smith said Captain Starr

You misunderstand me When we say Fort Brown Fort Russell Fort Et
Cetera we are inexact They are not fortified

Cantonment Et Cetera would be a trifle lengthy wouldnt it put in
the Doctor his endurance on the wane

Perhaps but technically descriptive of our Western posts The Germans
criticise these military laxities

Captain Duane now ceased talking but urbanely listened and from time
to time his eye would scan Augustus and then a certain sublimated
laugh to his wife well known would seize him for a single voiceless
spasm and pass The experienced Albumblatt meanwhile continued
Bytheway Doctor you know the Charite of course

Doctor Guild had visited that great hospital but being now a goaded man
he stuck his nose in his plate and said unwisely Sharrity Whats
that For then Augustus told him what and where it was and that
Krankenhaus is German for hospital and that he had been deeply
impressed with the modernity of the ventilation Thirtyfive cubic
metres to a bed in new wards he stated How many do you allow
Doctor

None answered the surgeon

Do I understand none Doctor

You do sir My patients breathe in cubic feet and swallow their doses
in grains and have their inflation measured in inches

Now there again exclaimed Augustus cheerily More antiquity to be
swept away And people say we young officers have no work cut out for
us

Patients dont die then under the metric system said the Doctor

No wonder Europes overcrowded said Starr

But the students mind inhabited heights above such trifling Death
he said occurs in ratios not differentiated from our statistics And
he told them much more while they booked at him over their plates He
managed to say modernity and differentiate again for he came from
our middle West where they encounter education too suddenly and it
would take three generations of him to speak clean English But with
all his polysyllabic wallowing he showed himself keenminded pat with
authorities a spruce young graduate among these dingy Rocky Mountain
campaigners They had fought and thirsted and frozen the books that he
knew were not written when they went to school and so far as war is to
be mastered on paper his equipment was full and polished while theirs
was meagre and rusty

And yet if you know things that other and older men do not it is as
well not to mention them too hastily These soldiers wished that they
could have been taught what he knew but they watched young Augustus
unfolding himself with a gaze that might have seemed chill to a less
highly abstract thinker He however rose from the table pleasantly
edified by himself and hopeful for them And as he left them
Goodnight ladies and gentlemen he said we shall meet again

Oh yes said the Doctor Again and again

Hes given me indigestion said Bainbridge

Take some metric system said Starr

And lie flat on your trajectory said the Doctor

I hate hair parted in the middle for a man said Mrs Guild

And his superior eyeglasses said Mrs Bainbridge

His staring conceited teeth hissed Mrs Starr

I dont like children slopping their knowledge all over me said the
Doctors wife

Hes well brushed though said Mrs Duane seeking the bright side
Hell wipe his feet on the mat when he comes to call

Id rather have mud on my carpet than that bandbox in any of my
chairs said Mrs Starr

Hes no fool mused the Doctor But kingdom come what an ass

Well gentlemen said the commanding officer and they perceived a
flavor of the official in his tone Mr Albumblatt is just twentyone
I dont know about you but Ill never have that excuse again

Very well Captain well be good said Mrs Bainbridge

And grrateful said Mrs Starr rolling her eyes piously I
prophecy hell entertain us

The Captains demeanor remained slightly official but walking home his
Catherine by his side in the dark was twice aware of that laugh of his
twinkling in the recesses of his opinions And later going to bed a
little joke took him so unready that it got out before he could suppress
it My love said he my Second Lieutenant is grievously mislaid in
the cavalry Providence designed him for the artillery

It was wifely but not right in Catherine to repeat this strict
confidence in strictest confidence to her neighbor Mrs Bainbridge
over the fence next morning before breakfast At breakfast Mrs
Bainbridge spoke of artillery reinforcing the post and her husband
giggled girlishly and looked at the puzzled Duane and at dinner Mrs
Starr asked Albumblatt would not artillery strengthen the garrison

Even a light battery pronounced Augustus promptly would be absurd
and useless

Whereupon the mess rattled knives sneezed and became variously
disturbed So they called him Albumbattery and then Blattery which is
more condensed and Captain Duanes official tone availed him nothing
in this matter But he made no more little military jokes he disliked
garrison personalities Civilized by birth and ripe from weatherbeaten
years of men and observing he looked his Second Lieutenant over and
remembered to have seen worse than this He had no quarrel with the
metric system truly the most sensible and thinking to leaven it with
a little rule of thumb he made Augustus his acting quartermaster But
he presently indulged his wife with the soldiercook she wanted at home
so they no longer had to eat their meals in Albumblatts society and
Mrs Starr said that this showed her husband dreaded his quartermaster
worse than the Secretary of War

Alas for the Quartermasters sergeant Johannes Schmoll that routined
and clockwork German He found Augustus so much more German than he
had ever been himself that he went speechless for three days Upon his
lists his red ink and his ciphering Augustus swooped like a bird
of prey and all his fond redtape devices were shredded to the winds
Augustus set going new quadratic ones of his own with an index and
crossreferences It was then that Schmoll recovered his speech and
walked alone saying Mein Gott And often thereafter wandering among
the piled stores and apparel he would fling both arms heavenward and
repeat the exclamation He had rated himself the unique human soul at
Fort Brown able to count and arrange underclothing Augustus rejected
his laborious tally and together they vigiled after hours verifying
socks and drawers Next Augustus found more horseshoes than his papers
called for

That man gif me der stomach pain efry day wailed Schmoll to Sergeant
Casey I tell him Lieutenant dose horseshoes is expendable We dont
acgount for efry shoe like they was mens shoes und oder dings dot is
issued I prefer to cake them cop says Baby Bismarck Und he smile
mit his two beaver teeth

Baby Bismarck cried joyfully the rosyfaced Casey Yohanny take
a drink

Und so continued the outraged Schmoll he haf a Board of Soorvey on
dreepound horseshoes und I haf der stomach pain

It was buckles the next month The allowance exceeded the expenditure
Augustuss arithmetic came out wrong and another board sat on buckles

Yohanny youre lookin jaded under Colonel Safetypin said Casey
Have something

Safetypin is my treat said Schmoll und very apt

But Augustus found leisure to pervade the post with his modernity He
set himself military problems and solved them he wrote an essay on
The Contact Squadron he corrected Bainbridge for saying throw back
the left flank instead of refuse the left flank he had readingroom
ideas canteen ideas ideas for the Indians and the Agency and
recruitdrill ideas which he presented to Sergeant Casey Casey gave
him in exchange the name of Napoleon ShaveTail and had his whiskey
again paid for by the sympathetic Schmoll

But bless his educated heart said Casey he dont learn me nothing
thatll soil my innercence

Thus did the sunnyhumored Sergeant take it but not thus the mess
Had Augustus seen himself as they saw him could he have heard Mrs
StarrBut he did not the youth was impervious and to remove his
complacency would require so Mrs Starr said an operation probably
fatal The commanding officer held always aloof from gibing yet often
when Augustus passed him his gray eye would dwell upon the Lieutenants
back and his voiceless laugh would possess him That is the picture I
retain of these daysthe unending golden sun the wide gentlecolored
plain the splendid mountains the Indians ambling through the flat
clear distance and here close along the paradeground eyeglassed
Augustus neatly hastening with the Captain on his porch asleep you
might suppose

One early morning the agent with two Indian chiefs waited on the
commanding officer and after their departure his wife found him
breakfasting in solitary mirth

Without me she chided sitting down And I know youve had some good
news

The best my love Providence has been tempted at last The wholesome
irony of life is about to function

Frank dont tease so And where are you rushing now before the cakes

To set our Augustus a little military problem dearest Plain living
for today and high thinking be jolly well

Frank youre going to swear and I must know

But Frank had sworn and hurried out to the right to the Adjutants
office while his Catherine flew to the left to the fence

Ella she cried Oh Ella

Mrs Bainbridge instantly on the other side of the fence brought
scanty light A telegram had come she knew from the Crow Agency in
Montana Her husband had admitted this three nights ago and Captain
Duane she knew had given him some orders about something and could
it be the Crows Ella I dont know said Catherine Frank talked all
about Providence in his incurable way and it may be anything So the
two ladies wondered together over the fence until Mrs Duane seeing
the Captain return ran to him and asked were the Crows on the
warpath Then her Frank told her yes and that he had detailed
Albumblatt to vanquish them and escort them to Carlisle School to learn
German and Beethovens sonatas

Stuff stuff stuff Why there he does go cried the unsettled
Catherine Its something at the Agency But Captain Duane was gone
into the house for a cigar

Albumblatt with Sergeant Casey and a detail of six men was in truth
hastening over that broad mile which opens between Fort Brown and the
Agency On either side of them the level plain stretched gray with
its sage buff with intervening grass haycocked with the smoky
mellowstained meerschaumlike canvas tepees of the Indians quiet as a
painting far eastward lay long low rosered hills half dissolved in
the trembling mystery of sun and distance and westward close at hand
and high shone the great paleblue serene mountains through the vaster
serenity of the air The sounding hoofs of the troops brought the
Indians out of their tepees to see When Albumblatt reached the Agency
there waited the agent and his two chiefs who pointed to one lodge
standing apart some three hundred yards and said He is there So
then Augustus beheld his problem the military duty fallen to him from
Providence and Captain Duane

It seems elementary for him who has written of The Contact Squadron
It was to arrest one Indian This man Ute Jack had done a murder among
the Crows and fled south for shelter The telegram heralded him but
with boundless miles for hiding he had stolen in under the cover of
night No welcome met him These Fort Brown Indians were not his friends
at any time and less so now when he arrived wild drunk among their
families Hounded out he sought this empty lodge and here he was
at bay his hand against every mans counting his own life worthless
except for destroying others before he must himself die

Is he armed Albumblatt inquired and was told yes

Augustus considered the peaked cone tent The opening was on this side
but a canvas drop closed it Not much of a problemone man inside a
sack with eight outside to catch him But the books gave no rule for
this combination and Augustus had met with nothing of the sort in
Germany He considered at some length Smoke began to rise through the
meeting poles of the tepee leisurely and natural and one of the chiefs
said

Maybe Ute Jack cooking He hungry

This is not a laughing matter said Augustus to the bystanders who
were swiftly gathering Tell him that I command him to surrender he
added to the agent who shouted this forthwith and silence followed

Tell him I say he must come out at once said Augustus then and
received further silence

He eat now observed the chief Cant talk much

Sergeant Casey bellowed Albumblatt go over there and take him out

The Lootenant understands said Casey slowly that Ute Jack has got
the drop on us and there aint no getting any drop on him

Sergeant you will execute your orders without further comment

At this amazing step the silence fell cold indeed but Augustus was in
command

Shall I take any men along sir said Casey in his soldiers machine
voice

Eryes Erno Erdo as you please

The six troopers stepped forward to go for they loved Casey but he
ordered them sharply to fall back Then looking in their eyes he
whispered Goodbye boys if its to be that way and walked to the
lodge lifted the flap and fell shot instantly dead through the heart
Two bullets into him muttered a trooper heavily breathing as the
sounds rang Hes down another spoke to himself with fixed eyes and
a sigh they did not know of passed among them The two chiefs looked at
Augustus and grunted short talk together and one with a sweeping lift
of his hand out towards the tepee and the dead man by it said Maybe
Ute Jack only got threefourcartridgesso his fingers counted
it After he kill threefourmen you get him pretty good The
Indian took the white mans death thus but the white men could not yet
be even saturnine

This will require reinforcement said Augustus to the audience The
place must be attacked by a front and flank movement It must be knocked
down I tell you I must have it knocked down How are you to see where
he is Id like to know if its not knocked down Augustuss voice was
getting high

I want the howitzer he screeched generally

A soldier saluted and Augustus chattered at him

The howitzer the mountain howitzer I tell you Dont you hear me To
knock the cursed thing hes in down Go to Captain Duane and give him my
compliments andno Ill go myself Wheres my horse My horse I tell
you Its got to be knocked down

If you please Lieutenant said the trooper may we have the Red
Cross ambulance

Red Cross Whats that for Whats that

Sergeant Casey sir Hes alyin there

Ambulance Certainly The howitzerperhaps theyre only flesh wounds
I hope they are only flesh wounds I must have more menyoull come
with me

From his porch Duane viewed both Augustus approach and the man stop
at the hospital and having expected a bungle sat to hear but at
Albumblatts mottled face he stood up quickly and said Whats the
matter And hearing burst out Casey Why he was worth fifty ofGo
on Mr Albumblatt What next did you achieve sir And as the tale was
told he cooled bitter but official

Reinforcements is it Mr Albumblatt

The howitzer Captain

Good And G troop

For my double flank movement I

Perhaps youd like H troop as reserve

Not reserve Captain I should establish

This is your duty Mr Albumblatt Perform it as you can with what
force you need

Thank you sir It is not exactly a battle but with a sotospeak
intrenched

Take your troops and go sir and report to me when you have arrested
your man

Then Duane went to the hospital and out with the ambulance hoping that
the soldier might not be dead But the wholesome irony of life reckons
beyond our calculations and the unreproachful sunny face of his
Sergeant evoked in Duanes memory many marches through long heat and
cold back in the rough good times

Hit twice I thought they told me said he and the steward surmised
that one had missed

Perhaps mused Duane And perhaps it went as intended too Whats
all that fuss

He turned sharply having lost Augustus among his sadder thoughts and
here were the operations going briskly Powdersmoke in three directions
at once Here were pickets far outlying and a double line of
skirmishers deployed in extended order and a mounted reserve and men
standing to horsea command of near a hundred a pudding of pompous
incompetent callow bosh with Augustus by his howitzer scientifically
raising and lowering it to bear on the lone white tepee that shone in
the plain Four races were assembled to look onthe mess Chinaman two
black laundresses all the whites in the place on horse and foot some
with their hats left behind and several hundred Indians in blankets
Duane had a thought to go away and leave this galling farce under the
eye of Starr for the officers were at hand also But his second thought
bade him remain and looking at Augustus and the howitzer his laugh
would have returned to him but his heart was sore for Casey

It was an hour of strategy and cannonade a humiliating hour which Fort
Brown tells of to this day and the tepee lived through it all For it
stood upon fifteen slender poles not speedily to be chopped down by
shooting lead from afar When low bullets drilled the canvas the chief
suggested to Augustus that Ute Jack had climbed up and when the bullets
flew high then Ute Jack was doubtless in a hole Nor did Augustus
contrive to drop a shell from the howitzer upon Ute Jack and explode
hima shrewd and deadly conception the shells went beyond except one
that ripped through the canvas somewhat near the ground and Augustus
dripping turned at length and saying It wont go down stood
vacantly wiping his white face Then the two chiefs got his leave to
stretch a rope between their horses and ride hard against the tepee It
was military neither in essence nor to see but it prevailed The tepee
sank a huge umbrella wreck along the earth and there lay Ute Jack
across the fires slight hollow his kneecap gone with the howitzer
shell But no blood had flown from that blood will not run you know
when a man has been dead some time One single other shot had struck
himone through his own heart It had singed the flesh

You see Mr Albumblatt said Duane in the whole crowds hearing
he killed himself directly after killing Casey A very rare act for
an Indian as you are doubtless aware But if your manoeuvres with his
corpse have taught you anything you did not know before we shall all be
gainers

Captain said Mrs Starr on a later day you and Ute Jack have ended
our fun Since the Court of Inquiry let Mr Albumblatt off he has not
said Germany onceand thats three months tomorrow




Twenty Minutes for Refreshments


Upon turning over again my diary of that excursion to the Pacific I
find that I set out from Atlantic waters on the 30th day of a backward
and forlorn April which had come and done nothing towards making its
share of spring but had gone missing its chance leaving the trees as
bare as it had received them from the winds of March It was not bleak
weather alone but care that I sought to escape by a change of sky
and I hoped for some fellowtraveller who might begin to interest my
thoughts at once No such person met me in the several Pullmans which
I inhabited from that afternoon until the forenoon of the following
Friday Through that long distance though I had slanted southwestward
across a multitude of States and vegetations and the Mississippi lay
eleven hundred miles to my rear the single event is my purchasing
some catseyes of the newsagent at Sierra Blanca Save this my diary
contains only neat additions of daily expenses and moral reflections
of a delicate and restrained melancholy They were Pecos catseyes he
told me obtained in the rocky canyons of that stream and destined to
be worth little until fashion turned from foreign jewels to become aware
of these fine native stones And I glad to possess the jewels of my
country chose two bracelets and a necklace of them paying but twenty
dollars for fifteen or sixteen catseyes and resolved to give them
a setting worthy of their beauty The diary continues with moral
reflections upon the servility of our taste before anything European
and the handwriting is clear and deliberate It abruptly becomes
hurried and at length wellnigh illegible It is best I think
that you should have this portion as it comes unpolished unamended
unarrangedhot so to speak from my immediate pencil instead of cold
from my subsequent pen I shall disguise certain names but that is all

Friday forenoon May 5I dont have to gaze at my catseyes to kill
time any more Im not the only passenger any more Theres a lady
She got in at El Paso She has taken the drawingroom but sits outside
reading newspaper cuttings and writing letters She is sixty I should
say and has a cap and one gray curl This comes down over her left ear
as far as a purple ribbon which suspends a medallion at her throat She
came in wearing a sagegreen duster of pongee silk pretty nice only
the buttons are as big as those largest mintdrops You porter she
said brush this He put down her many things and received it Her
dress was sage green and pretty nice too You porter said she open
every window Why they are I declare Whats the thermometer in this
car Ninetyfive maam Folks mostly travelling That will do
porter Now you go make me a pitcher of lemonade right quick She went
into the stateroom and shut the door When she came out she was dressed
in what appeared to be chintz bedroom curtains They hang and flow
loosely about her and are covered with a pattern of pink peonies She
has slippersTurkishthat stare up in the air pretty handsome and
comfortable But I never before saw any one travel with flypaper It
must be hard to pack But its quite an idea in this train Fully a
dozen flies have stuck to it already and she reads her clippings
and writes away and sips another glass of lemonade all with the most
extreme appearance of leisure not to say sloth I cant imagine how she
manages to produce this atmosphere of indolence when in reality she is
steadily occupied Possibly the way she sits But I think its partly
the bedroom curtains

These notes were interrupted by the entrance of the new conductor
If you folks have chartered a private car just say so he shouted
instantly at the sight of us He stood still at the extreme end and
removed his hat which was acknowledged by the lady Travel is surely
very light Gadsden she assented and went on with her writing But
he remained standing still and shouting like an orator Sprinkle the
floor of this car Julius and let the pore passengers get a breath of
cool My lands He fanned himself sweepingly with his hat He seemed
but little larger than a red squirrel and precisely that color Sorrel
hair sorrel eyebrows sorrel freckles light sorrel mustache thin
aggressive nose receding chin and black attentive prominent eyes
He approached and I gave him my ticket which is as long as a necktie
and has my height the color of my eyes and hair and my general
description punched in the margin Why you aint middleaged
he shouted and a singular croak sounded behind me But the lady was
writing I have been growing younger since I bought that ticket I
explained Thats it thats it he sang a mans always as old as he
feels and a womanis ever young he finished I see you are true to
the old teachings and the oldtime chivalry Gadsden said the lady
continuously busy Yes maam Jacob served seven years for Leah and
seven more for Rachel Such men are raised today in every worthy
Louisiana home Gadsden be it ever so humble Yes maam Give a
fresh sprinkle to the floor Julius soon as it goes to get dry Excuse
me but do you shave yourself sir I told him that I did but without
excusing him You will see that I have a reason for asking he
consequently pursued and took out of his coattails a round tin box
handsomely labelled Nat Fly Paper Co so that I supposed it was
thus of course that the lady came by her flypaper But this was pure
coincidence and the conductor explained That companys me and a man
at Shreveport but he dissatisfies me right frequently You know what
heaven a good razor is for a man and what you feel about a bad one
Vaseline and ground shells he said opening the box and Im not
saying anything except it will last your lifetime and never hardens Rub
the size of a pea on the fine side of your strop spread it to an inch
with your thumb May I beg a favor on so short a meeting Join me in
the gentlemens lavatory with your razorstrop in five minutes I have
to attend to a corpse in the baggagecar and will return at once
Anybodys corpse I know Gadsden said the lady No maam Just a
corpse

When I joined him for I was now willing to do anything he was
apologetic again Tis a short acquaintance he said but may I also
beg your razor Quick as I get out of the National Fly I am going to
register my new label First there will be Uncle Sam embracing the
world signifying this mixture is universal then my name then the
word Stropine which is a novelty and carries copyright and I shall
win comfort and doubtless luxury The post barber at Fort Bayard took a
dozen off me at sight to retail to the niggers of the Twentyfourth and
as he did not happen to have the requisite cash on his person I charged
him two roosters and fifty cents and both of us done well Hes after
more Stropine and I got Pullman prices for my roosters the buffetcar
being out of chicken a la Marengo There is your razor sir and I
appreciate your courtesy It was beautifully sharpened and I bought
a box of the Stropine and asked him who the lady was Mrs Porcher
Brewton he exclaimed Have you never met her socially Why shewhy
she is the most intellectual lady in Bee Bayou Indeed I said Why
she visits New Orleans and Charleston and all the principal centres of
refinement and is welcomed in Washington She converses freely with our
statesmen and is considered a queen of learning Why she writes potry
sir and is strongminded But a man wouldnt want to pick her up for a
fool all the samey I shouldnt I dont said I Dont you do it
sir Shes run her plantation all alone since the Colonel was killed in
sixtytwo She taught me Sundayschool when I was a lad and she used to
catch me at her pecantrees most every time in Bee Bayou

He went forward and I went back with the Stropine in my pocket The
lady was sipping the last of the lemonade and looking haughtily over the
top of her glass into I suppose the world of her thoughts Her eyes
met mine however Has Gadsdenyes I perceive he has been telling
about me she said in her languid formidable voice She set her glass
down and reclined among the folds of the bedroom curtains considering
me Gadsden has always been lavish she mused caressingly He seems
destined to succeed in life I hazarded ah na she sighed with
decision He will fail As she said no more and as I began to resent
the manner in which she surveyed me I remarked You seem rather sure
of his failure I am old enough to be his mother and yours said
Mrs Porcher Brewton among her curtains He is a noblehearted fellow
and would have been a highsouled Southern gentleman if born to
that station But what should a conductor earning 10350 a month be
dispersing his attention on silly patents for Manys the time Ive
told him what I think but Gadsden will always be flighty No further
observations occurring to me I took up my necklace and bracelets from
the seat and put them in my pocket Will you permit a meddlesome old
woman to inquire what made you buy those catseyes said Mrs Brewton
Why I dubiously began Never mind she cried archly If you were
thinking of some one in your Northern home they will be prized because
the thought at any rate was beautiful and genuine Whereer I roam
whatever realms to see my heart untravelled fondly turns to thee
Now dont you be embarrassed by an old woman I desired to inform her
that I disliked her but one can never do those things and anxious
to learn what was the matter with the catseyes I spoke amiably and
politely to her Twenty dollars she murmured And he told you they
came from the Pecos She gave that single melodious croak I had heard
once before Then she sat up with her back as straight as if she was
twenty My dear young fellow never do you buy trash in these trains
Here you are with your coat full ofwhats Gadsdens absurd razor
concoctionsstrutstropbother And Chinese paste buttons Last
summer on the Northern Pacific the man offered your catseyes to me
as native gems found exclusively in Dakota But I just sat and mentioned
to him that I was on my way home from a holiday in China and he went
right out of the car The last day I was in Canton I bought a box of
those catseyes at eight cents a dozen After this we spoke a little
on other subjects and now shes busy writing again Shes on business
in California but will read a paper at Los Angeles at the annual
meeting of the Golden Daughters of the West The meal station is coming
but we have agreed to

Later Friday afternoonI have been interrupted again Gadsden
entered removed his hat and shouted Sharon Twenty minutes for
dinner I was calling the porter to order a buffet lunch in the car
when there tramped in upon us three large men of such appearance that
a flash of thankfulness went through me at having so little readymoney
and only a silver watch Mrs Brewton looked at them and said Well
gentlemen and they took off their embroidered Mexican hats Weve got
a baby show here said one of them slowly looking at me and wed
be kind of obliged if youd hold the box Theres lunch put up in
a basket for you to take along said the next and a bottle of
winechampagne So losing your dinner wont lose you nothing Were
looking for somebody raised East and without local prejudice said the
third So we come to the Pullman I now saw that so far from purposing
to rob us they were in a great and honest distress of mind But I am
no judge of a baby said I not being mar You dont have to be
broke in the first more slowly and earnestly Its a fair and secret
ballot were striving for The votes is wrote out and ready and all
were shy of is a stranger without family ties or business interests to
hold the box and do the counting His deep tones ceased and he wiped
heavy drops from his forehead with his shirt sleeve Wed be kind of
awful obliged to you he urged The town would be liable to make it
two bottles said the second The third brought his fist down on the
back of a seat and said Ill make it that now But gentlemen said
I five six and seven years ago I was not a stranger in Sharon If my
friend Dean Drake was still here But he aint Now you might as well
help folks and eat later This town will trust you And if you quit
us Once more he wiped the heavy drops away while in a voice full of
appeal his friend finished his thought If we lose you well likely
have to wait till this train comes in tomorrow for a man satisfactory
to this town And the show is costing us a heap A light hand tapped
my arm and here was Mrs Brewton saying For shame Show your
enterprise Ill hold this yere train shouted Gadsden if
necessary Mrs Brewton rose alertly and they all hurried me out My
slippers will stay right on when Im down the steps said Mrs Brewton
and Gadsden helped her descend into the blazing dust and sun of Sharon
Gracious said she what a place But I make it a point to see
everything as I go Nothing had changed There as of old lay the
flat litter of the townsheds stores and dwellings a shapeless
congregation in the desert gaping wide everywhere to the glassy
quivering immensity and there above the roofs turned the slatted
windwheels But close to the tracks opposite the hotel was an
edifice a sort of tent of bunting from which brass music issued
while about a hundred pink and blue sunbonnets moved and mixed near
the entrance Little black Mexicans like charred toys lounged and lay
staring among the ungraded dunes of sand Gracious said Mrs Brewton
again Her eye lost nothing and as she made for the tent the chintz
peonies flowed around her and her step was surprisingly light We
passed through the sunbonnets and entered where the music played The
precious blessed darlings she exclaimed clasping her hands This
will do for the Golden Daughters she rapidly added yes this will
distinctly do And she hastened away from me into the throng

I had no time to look at much this first general minute I could see
there were booths each containing a separate baby I passed a whole
section of naked babies and one baby farther along had on golden wings
and a crown and was bawling frightfully Their names were over the
booths and I noticed Lucille Erskine Wales Banquo Lick Nolin Cuba
Manilla Ellabelle Bosco Grady James J Corbett Nash and Aqua Marine
There was a great sign at the end painted Mrs Edens Manna in the
Wilderness and another sign labelled Shotgun Smiths twins In the
midst of these first few impressions I found myself seated behind a bare
table raised three feet or so with two boxes on it and a quantity
of blank paper and pencils while one of the men was explaining me
the rules and facts I cant remember them all now because I couldnt
understand them all then and Mrs Brewton was distant among the
sunbonnets talking to a gathering crowd and feeling in the mouths of
babies that were being snatched out of the booths and brought to her
The man was instructing me steadily all the while and it occurred to me
to nod silently and coldly now and then as if I was doing this sort of
thing every day But I insisted that some one should help me count and
they gave me Gadsden

Now these facts I do remember very clearly and shall never forget them
The babies came from two townsSharon and Rincon its neighbor Alone
neither had enough for a good show though in both it was every familys
pride to have a baby every year The babies were in three classes Six
months and under one prize offered eighteen months two prizes three
years two prizes A threefourths vote of all cast was necessary to
a choice No one entitled to vote unless of immediate family of a
competing baby No one entitled to cast more than one vote There were
rules of entry and fees but I forget them except that no one could
have two exhibits in the same class When I read this I asked how about
twins Well we didnt kind of foresee that muttered my instructor
painfully what would be your idea Look here you sir interposed
Mrs Brewton he came in to count votes I was very glad to have her
back Thats right maam admitted the man he neednt to say a
thing Weve only got one twins entered he pursued which were glad
of Shotgun Where is this Mr Smith interrupted Mrs Brewton
Uptown drinking maam And who may Mr Smith be Most popular
citizen of Rincon maam We had to accept his twins becausewell
he come down here himself and most of Rincon come with him and as we
aimed to have everything pass off pleasantlike I quite comprehend
said Mrs Brewton And I should consider twins within the rule or any
number born at one time But little Aqua Marine is the finest single
child in that six months class I told her mother she ought to take that
splurgy ring off the poor little things thumb Its most unsafe But
I should vote for that child myself Thank you for your valuable
endorsement said a spruce slim young man But the public is not
allowed to vote here he added He was standing on the floor and
resting his elbows on the table Mrs Brewton stared down at him Are
you the father of the child she inquired Oh no I am the agent I
Aqua Marines agent said Mrs Brewton sharply Ha ha went the
young man Ha ha Well thats good too Shes part of our exhibit
Im in charge of the mannafeds dont you know I dont know said
Mrs Brewton Why Mrs Edens Manna in the Wilderness Nourishes
strengthens and makes no unhealthy fat Take a circular and welcome
Im travelling for the manna I organized this show Ive conducted
twentyeight similar shows in two years We hold them in every State
and Territory Second of last March I gave Denveryou heard of it
probably I did not said Mrs Brewton Well Ha ha I thought
every person up to date had heard of Denvers Olympic Offspring Olio
Is it up to date to loll your elbows on the table when youre speaking
to a lady inquired Mrs Brewton He jumped and then grew scarlet
with rage I didnt expect to learn manners in New Mexico said he
I doubt if you will said Mrs Brewton and turned her back on him He
was white now but better instincts or else business prevailed in his
injured bosom Well said he I had no bad intentions I was going
to say youd have seen ten thousand people and five hundred babies at
Denver And our mannafeds won out to beat the band Three first medals
and all exclusively mannafed We took the costume prize also Of course
here in Sharon Ive simplified No special medal for weight beauty
costume or decorated perambulator Well I must go back to our exhibit
Glad to have you give us a call up there and see the medals were
offering and our fifteen mannafeds and take a package away with you
He was gone

The voters had been now voting in my two boxes for some time and I
found myself hoping the manna would not win whoever did but it seemed
this agent was a very capable person To begin with every family
entering a baby drew a package of the manna free and one package
contained a diamond ring Then he had managed to have the finest babies
of all classes in his own exhibit This was incontestable Mrs Brewton
admitted after returning from a general inspection and it seemed to us
extraordinary Thats easy maam said Gadsden he came around here
a month ago Dont you see I did not see but Mrs Brewton saw at
once He had made a quiet selection of babies beforehand and then
introduced the manna into those homes And everybody in the room was
remarking that his show was very superior taken as a whole they all
added taken as a whole I heard them as they came up to vote for
the 3year and the 18month classes The 6month was to wait till
last because the third box had been accidentally smashed by Mr Smith
Gadsden caught several trying to vote twice No you dont he would
shout I know faces Im not a conductor for nothing And the victim
would fall back amid jeers from the sunbonnets Once the passengers
sent over to know when the train was going Tell them to step over here
and theyll not feel so lonesome shouted Gadsden and I think a good
many came The band was playing White Wings with quite a number
singing it when Gadsden noticed the voting had ceased and announced
this ballot closed The music paused for him and we could suddenly hear
how many babies were in distress but for a moment only as we began
our counting White Wings resumed and the sunbonnets outsang their
progeny There was something quite singular in the way they had voted
Here are some of the 3yearold tickets First choice Ulysses Grant
Blum 2d choice Lewis Hendricks First choice James Redfield 2d
Lewis Hendricks First Elk Chester 2d Lewis Hendricks Can
it be said the excited Gadsden Finish these quick Ill open the
18monthers But he swung round to me at once See there he cried
Read that and that He plunged among more and I read First choice
Lawrence Nepton Ford Jr 2d Iona Judd First choice Mary Louise
Kenton 2d Iona Judd Hurry up said Gadsden thats it And as we
counted Mrs Brewton looked over my shoulder and uttered her melodious
croak for which I saw no reason That young whippersnapper will go
far she observed nor did I understand this But when they stopped the
band for me to announce the returns one fact did dawn on me even
while I was reading Threeyearolds Whole number of votes cast 300
necessary to a choice 225 Second prize Lewis Hendricks receiving
300 First prize largest number of votes cast 11 for Salvisa van
Meter No award Eighteenmonth class Whole number of votes cast 300
necessary to a choice 225 Second prize Iona Judd receiving 300
Lillian Brown gets 15 for 1st prize None awarded There was a very
feeble applause and then silence for a second and then the sunbonnets
rushed together rushed away to others rushed back and talk swept like
hail through the place Yes that is what they had done They had all
voted for Lewis Hendricks and Iona Judd for second prize and every
family had voted the first prize to its own baby The Browns and van
Meters happened to be the largest families present Hell go far hell
go far repeated Mrs Brewton Sport glittered in her eye She gathered
her curtains and was among the sunbonnets in a moment Then it fully
dawned on me The agent for Mrs Edens Manna in the Wilderness was
indeed a shrewd strategist and knew his people to the roots of the
grass They had never seen a babyshow They were innocent He came
among them He gave away packages of manna and a diamond ring He
offered the prizes But he proposed to win some Therefore he made that
rule about only the immediate families voting He foresaw what they
would do and now they had done it Whatever happened two prizes went
to his mannafeds They dont see through it in the least which is
just as well said Mrs Brewton returning And its little matter
that only second prizes go to the best babies But whats to be done
now I had no idea but it was not necessary that I should

You folks of Rincon and Sharon spoke a deep voice It was the first
man in the Pullman and drops were rolling from his forehead and his
eyes were the eyes of a beleaguered ox You fathers and mothers he
said and took another breath They grew quiet Im a father myself
as is well known They applauded this Salvisa is mine and she got
my vote The father that will not support his own child is notdoes
notis worse than if they were orphans He breathed again while they
loudly applauded But folks Ive got to get home to Rincon Ive
got to And Ill give up Salvisa if Im met fair Yes yes youll
be met said voices of men Well heres my proposition Mrs Edens
manna has took two and Im satisfied it should We voted and will stay
voted Yes yes Well now heres Sharon and Rincon two of the
finest towns in this section and I say Sharon and Rincon has equal
rights to get something out of this and drop private feelings and
everybody back their town And I say let this lady and gentleman who
will act elegant and on the square take a view and nominate the finest
Rincon 3yearold and the finest Sharon 18month they can cut out of the
herd And I say lets vote unanimous on their pick and let each town
hold a first prize and go home in friendship feeling it has been
treated right

Universal cheers endorsed him and he got down panting The band played
Union Forever and I accompanied Mrs Brewton to the booths Youll
remember shouted the orator urgently after us one apiece We
nodded Dont get mixed he appealingly insisted We shook our heads
and out of the booths rushed two women and simultaneously dashed their
infants in our faces Youll never pass Cuba by entreated one This
is Bosco Grady said the other Cuba wore an immense garment made of
the American flag but her mother whirled her out of it in a second
See them dimples see them knees she said See them feet Only feel
of her toes Look at his arms screamed the mother of Bosco Doubled
his weight in four months Did he indeed maam said Cubas mother
well he hadnt much to double Didnt he then Didnt he indeed
No at you he didnt indeed and indeed I guess Cuba is known to
Sharon I guess Sharonll not let Cuba be slighted Well and I guess
Rinconll see that Bosco Grady gets his rights Ladies said Mrs
Brewton towering but poetical with her curl I am a mother myself and
raised five noble boys and two sweet peerless girls This stopped them
immediately they stared at her and her chintz peonies as she put the
curl gently away from her medallion and proceeded But never did I
think of myself in those dark weary days of the long ago I thought of
my country and the Lost Cause They stared at her fascinated Yes
mm whispered they quite humbly Now said Mrs Brewton what is
more sacred than an American mothers love Therefore let her not shame
it with anger and strife All little boys and girls are precious gems to
me and to you What is a cold lifeless medal compared to one of them
Though I would that all could get the prize But they cant you know
No mm Many mothers with their children in their arms were now
dumbly watching Mrs Brewton who held them with a honeyed convincing
smile If I choose only one in this beautiful and encouraging harvest
it is because I have no other choice Thank you so much for letting
me see that little hero and that lovely angel she added with a yet
sweeter glance to the mothers of Bosco and Cuba And I wish them all
luck when their turn comes Ive no say about the 6month class you
know And now a little room please

The mothers fell back But my head swam slightly The 6month class to
be sure The orator had forgotten all about it In the general joy over
his wise and fair proposition nobody had thought of it But they would
pretty soon Cuba and Bosco were likely to remind them Then we should
still be face to face with a state of things thatI cast a glance
behind at those two mothers of Sharon and Rincon following us and I
asked Mrs Brewton to look at them Dont think about it now said
she it will only mix you I always like to take a thing when it comes
and not before We now reached the 18month class They were the
naked ones The 6month had stayed nicely in peoples arms these were
crawling hastily everywhere like crabs upset in the market and
they screamed fiercely when taken upon the lap The mother of Thomas
Jefferson Brayin Lucas showed us a framed letter from the statesman for
whom her child was called The letter reeked with gratitude and
said that offspring was mans proudest privilege that a souvenir
sixteentoone spoon would have been cheerfully sent but 428 babies had
been named after Mr Brayin since January It congratulated the swelling
army of the Peoples Cause But there was nothing eminent about little
Thomas except the letter and we selected Reese Moran a vigorous Sharon
baby who when they attempted to set him down and pacify him stiffened
his legs dashed his candy to the floor and burst into lamentation We
were soon on our way to the 3year class for Mrs Brewton was rapid
and thorough As we went by the Manna Exhibit the agent among his
packages and babies invited us in He was loudly declaring that he would
vote for Bosco if he could But when he examined Cuba he became sure
that Denver had nothing finer than that Mrs Brewton took no notice of
him but bade me admire Aqua Marine as far surpassing any other 6month
child I proclaimed her splendid she was a wideeyed contented thing
with a head shaped like a croquet mallet and the agent smiled modestly
and told the mothers that as for his babies two prizes was luck enough
for them they didnt want the earth If that thing happened to be
brass said Mrs Brewton bending over the ring that Aqua was still
sucking and again remonstrating with the mother for this imprudence
she passed on The threeyearolds were many of them in costume with
extraordinary arrangements of hair and here was the child with gold
wings and a crown I had seen on arriving Her name was Verbena M and
she personated Faith She had colored slippers and was drinking
tea from her mothers cup Another child named Broderick McGowan
represented Columbus and joyfully shouted Kiyi every halfminute
One child was attired as a prominent admiral another as a prominent
general and one stood in a boat and was Washington As Mrs Brewton
examined them and dealt with the mothers the names struck me
afreshnot so much the boys Ulysses Grant and James J Corbett
explained themselves but I read the names of five adjacent girlsLula
Ocilla Nila Cusseta and Maylene And I asked Mrs Brewton how they
got them From romances she told me in papers that we of the upper
classes never see In choosing Horace Boyd of Rincon for his hair
his full set of front teeth well cared for and his general beauty I
think both of us were also influenced by his good sensible name and his
good clean sensible clothes With both our selections once they were
settled were Sharon and Rincon satisfied We were turning back to the
table to announce our choice when a sudden clamor arose behind us
and we saw confusion in the Manna Department Women were running and
shrieking and I hastened after Mrs Brewton to see what was the matter
Aqua Marine had swallowed the ring on her thumb It was gold it was
pure gold wailed the mother clutching Mrs Brewton It cost a whole
dollar in El Paso She must have white of egg instantly said Mrs
Brewton handing me her purse Run to the hotel Save your money
said the agent springing forward with some eggs in a bowl Lord you
dont catch us without all the appliances handy Wed run behind the
trade in no time There now there he added comfortingly to the
mother Will you make her swallow it Better let mebetter let meAnd
heres the emetic Lord why we had three swallowed rings at the Denver
Olio and I got em all safe back within ten minutes after time of
swallowing You go away said Mrs Brewton to me and tell them our
nominations The mothers sympathetically surrounded poor little Aqua
saying to each other Shes a beautiful child Sure indeed she is
But the mannafeds has had their turn Sure indeed theyve been
recognized and so forth while I was glad to retire to the voting
table The music paused for me and as the crowd cheered my small
speech some one said And now what are you going to do about me It
was Bosco Grady back again and close behind him Cuba They had escaped
from Mrs Brewtons eye and had got me alone But I pretended in the
noise and cheering not to see these mothers I noticed a woman hurrying
out of the tent and hoped Aqua was not in further troubleshe was
still surrounded I could see Then the orator made some silence
thanked us in the names of Sharon and Rincon and proposed our
candidates be voted on by acclamation This was done Rincon voted for
Sharon and Reese Moran in a solid roar and Sharon voted for Rincon and
Horace Boyd in a roar equally solid So now each had a prize and the
whole place was applauding happily and the band was beginning again
when the mothers with Cuba and Bosco jumped up beside me on the
platform and the sight of them produced immediate silence

Theres a good many here has a right to feel satisfied said Mrs
Grady looking about and theyre welcome to their feelings But if
this meeting thinks it is through with its business I can tell it that
it aintnot if it acts honorable it aint Does those that have had
their chance and those that can take home their prizes expect us 6month
mothers come here for nothing Do they expect I brought my Bosco from
Rincon to be insulted and him the pride of the town Cuba is known
to Sharon spoke the other lady Ill say no more Jumping Jeans
murmured the orator to himself I cant hold this train much longer
said Gadsden shes due at Lordsburg now Youll have made it up by
Tucson Gadsden spoke Mrs Brewton quietly across the whole assembly
from the Manna Department As for towns continued Mrs Grady that
think anything of a baby thats only got three teeth Ha Ha
laughed Cubas mother shrilly Teeth Well were not proud of bald
babies in Sharon Bosco was certainly bald All the men were looking
wretched and all the women were growing more and more like eagles
Moreover they were separating into two bands and taking their husbands
with themSharon and Rincon drawing to opposite parts of the tentand
what was coming I cannot say for we all had to think of something else
A third woman bringing a man mounted the platform It was she I
had seen hurry out My names Shotgun Smith said the man very
carefully and Im told youve reached my case He was extremely
goodlooking with a blue eye and a blond mustache not above thirty
and was trying hard to be sober holding himself with dignity Are you
the judge said he to me Hell I began Nnot guilty your honor
said he At this his wife looked anxious Sselfdefence he slowly
continued told you once already Why Rolfe exclaimed his wife
touching his elbow Dont you cry little woman said he thisll
come out all right Where re the witnesses Why Rolfe Rolfe She
shook him as you shake a sleepy child Now see here said he and
wagged a finger at her affectionately you promised me youd not cry
if I let you come Rolfe dear its not that today its the twins
Its your twins Shotgun this time said many mens voices We
acquitted you all right last month Justifiable homicide said
Gadsden Dont you remember Twins said Shotgun drowsily Oh yes
mine Why He opened on us his blue eyes that looked about as innocent
as Aqua Marines and he grew more awake Then he blushed deeply face
and forehead I was not coming to this kind of thing he explained
But she wanted the twins to get something He put his hand on her
shoulder and straightened himself I done a heap of prospecting before
I struck this claim said he patting her shoulder We got married
last March a year Its our firstfirstfirsthe turned to me with a
confiding smileits our first dividend judge Rolfe I never You
come right down And now lets go get a prize he declared with his
confiding pleasantness I remember now I remember They claimed twins
was barred And I kicked down the bars Take me to those twins Theyre
not named yet judge After they get the prize well name them fine
names as good as any they got anywhereEurope Asia Africaanywhere
My gracious I wish they was boys Come on judge You and mell go give
em a prize and then well drink to em He hugged me suddenly and
affectionately and we half fell down the steps But Gadsden as suddenly
caught him and righted him and we proceeded to the twins Mrs Smith
looked at me helplessly saying Im that sorry sir I had no idea
he was going to be that gamesome Not at all I said not at all
Under many circumstances I should have delighted in Shotguns society
He seemed so utterly sure that now he had explained himself everybody
would rejoice to give the remainingmedal to his little girls But
Bosco and Cuba had not been idle Shotgun did not notice the spread of
whispers nor feel the divided and jealous currents in the air as he
sat and in expanding goodwill talked himself almost sober To entice
him out there was no way Several of his friends had tried it But
beneath his innocence there seemed to lurk something wary and I grew
apprehensive about holding the box this last time But Gadsden relieved
me as our count began Shotgun is a splendid man said he and he
has trailed more trainrobbers than any deputy in New Mexico But he has
seen too many friends today and is not quite himself So when he fell
down that time I just took this off him He opened the drawer and
there lay a sixshooter It was touch and go said Gadsden but hes
thinking that hard about his twins that hes not missed it yet Twould
have been the act of an enemy to leave that on him todayWell dyou
say he broke off Well well well It was the tickets we took out
of the box that set him exclaiming I began to read them and saw that
the agent was no mere politician but a statesman His Aqua Marine had a
solid vote I remembered his extreme praise of both Bosco and Cuba This
had set Rincon and Sharon bitterly against each other I remembered his
modesty about Aqua Marine Of course Each town unable to bear the
idea of the others beating it had voted for the mannafed who had 299
votes Shotgun and his wife had voted for their twins I looked towards
the Manna Department and could see that Aqua Marine was placid once
more and Mrs Brewton was dancing the ring before her eyes I hope I
announced the returns in a firm voice What said Shotgun Smith and
at that sound Mrs Brewton stopped dancing the ring He strode to our
table Theres the winner said Gadsden quickly pointing to the
Manna Exhibit What shouted Smith again and they quit me for that
hammerheaded sonofagun He whirled around The men stood ready and
the women fled shrieking and cowering to their infants in the booths
Gentlemen Gentlemen cried Gadsden dont hurt him Look here And
from the drawer he displayed Shotguns weapon They understood in a
second and calmly watched the enraged and disappointed Shotgun But he
was a man He saw how he had frightened the women and he stood in the
middle of the floor with eyes that did not at all resemble Aqua Marines
at present Im all right now boys he said I hope Ive harmed no
one Ladies will you try and forget about me making such a break It
got ahead of me I guess for I had promised the little woman He
stopped himself and then his eye fell upon the Manna Department I
guess I dont like one thing much now Im not after prizes Id not
accept one from a goldbugcombinetrust that comes sneaking around
stuffing wholesale concoctions into our childrens systems My twins are
not mannafed My twins are raised as nature intended Perhaps if they
were swelled out with trash that acts like bakingpowder they would
have a medal toofor I notice he has made you vote his way pretty often
this afternoon I saw the agent at the end of the room look very queer
Thats so said several I think Ill clear out his boxes said
Shotgun with rising joy I feel like Ive got to do something before
I go home Come on judge He swooped towards the manna with a yell
and the men swooped with him and Gadsden and I were swooped with them
Again the women shrieked But Mrs Brewton stood out before the boxes
with her curl and her chintz

Mr Smith said she you are not going to do anything like that You
are going to behave yourself like the gentleman you are and not like
the wild beast thats inside you Never in his life before probably
had Shotgun been addressed in such a manner and he too became
hypnotized fixing his blue eyes upon the strange lady I do not
believe in patent foods for children said Mrs Brewton We agree
on that Mr Smith and I am a grandmother and I attend to what my
grandchildren eat But this highly adroit young man has done you no
harm If he has the prizes whose doing is that please And who paid
for them Will you tell me please Ah you are all silent And she
croaked melodiously Now let him and his manna go along But I have
enjoyed meeting you all and I shall not forget you soon And Mr
Smith I want you to remember me Will you please She walked to Mrs
Smith and the twins and Shotgun followed her entirely hypnotized She
beckoned to me Your judge and I she said consider not only your
beautiful twins worthy of a prize but also the mother and father
that can so proudly claim them She put her hand in my pocket These
catseyes she said you will wear and think of me and the judge
who presents them She placed a bracelet on each twin and the necklace
upon Mrs Smiths neck Give him Gadsdens stuff she whispered to me
Do you shave yourself sir said I taking out the Stropine Vaseline
and ground shells and will last your life Rub the size of a pea on
your strop and spread it to an inch I placed the box in Shotguns
motionless hand And now Gadsden well take the train said Mrs
Brewton Heres your lunch Heres your wine said the orator forcing
a basket upon me I dont know what wed have done without you and your
mother A flash of indignation crossed Mrs Brewtons face but changed
to a smile Youve forgot to name my girls exclaimed Shotgun
suddenly finding his voice Suppose you try that said Mrs Brewton to
me a trifle viciously Thank you I said to Smith Thank you
I Something handsome he urged How would Cynthia do for one I
suggested Shucks no Ive known two Cynthias You dont want that
he asked Mrs Smith and she did not at all Something extra something
fine something not stale said he I looked about the room There was
no time for thought but my eye fell once more upon Cuba This reminded
me of Spain and the Spanish and my brain leaped I have them
I cried Armada and Loyola Thats what theyre named said
Shotgun write it for us And I did Once more the band played and
we left them all calling Goodbye maam Goodbye judge happy
as possible The train was soon going sixty miles an hour through the
desert We had passed Lordsburg San Simon and were nearly at Benson
before Mrs Brewton and Gadsden whom she made sit down with us and I
finished the lunch and champagne I wonder how long hell remember me
mused Mrs Brewton at Tucson where we were on time That woman is not
worth one of his boots

Saturday afternoon May 6Near Los Angeles I have been writing all
day to be sure and get everything in and now Sharon is twentyfour
hours ago and here there are roses gardens and many nice houses at
the waystations Oh George Washington father of your country what a
brindled litter have you sired

But here the moral reflections begin again and I copy no more diary
Mrs Brewton liked my names for the twins Theyll pronounce it
Loyola she said and that sounds right lovely Later she sent me
her paper for the Golden Daughters It is full of poetry and sentiment
and all the things I have missed She wrote that if she had been sure
the agent had helped Aqua Marine to swallow the ring she would have let
them smash his boxes And I think she was a little in love with Shotgun
Smith But what a pity we shall soon have no more Mrs Brewtons The
causes that produced herslavery isolation literary tendencies
adversity game bloodthat combination is broken forever I shall speak
to Mr Howells about her She ought to be recorded




The Promised Land


Perhaps there were ten of themthese galloping dots were hard to
countdown in the distant bottom across the river Their swiftly moving
dust hung with them close thinning to a yellow veil when they halted
short They clustered a moment then parted like beads and went wide
asunder on the plain They veered singly over the level merged in twos
and threes apparently racing shrank together like elastic and broke
ranks again to swerve over the stretching waste From this visioned
pantomime presently came a sound a tiny shot The figures were too
far for discerning which fired it It evidently did no harm and was
repeated at once A babel of diminutive explosions followed while the
horsemen galloped on in unexpected circles Soon for no visible reason
the dots ran together bunching compactly The shooting stopped the
dust rose thick again from the crowded hoofs cloaking the group and so
passed back and was lost among the silent barren hills

Four emigrants had watched this from the high bleak rim of the Big Bend
They stood where the flat of the desert broke and tilted down in grooves
and bulges deep to the lurking Columbia Empty levels lay opposite
narrowing up into the high country

Thats the Colville Reservation across the river from us said the
man

Another sighed his wife

The last Indians well strike Our trail to the Okanagon goes over a
corner of it

Were going to those hills The mother looked at her little girl and
back where the cloud had gone

Only a corner Liza The ferry puts us over on it and weve got to
go by the ferry or stay this side of the Columbia You wouldnt want to
start a home here

They had driven twentyone hundred miles at a walk Standing by them
were the six horses with the wagon and its tunneled roof of canvas
shone duskily on the empty verge of the wilderness A dry windless
air hung over the tableland of the Big Bend but a sound rose from
somewhere floating voluminous upon the silence and sank again

Rapids The man pointed far up the giant rut of the stream to where a
streak of white water twinkled at the foot of the hills Weve struck
the river too high he added

Then we dont cross here said the woman quickly

No By what they told me the cabin and the ferry ought to be five miles
down

Her face fell Only five miles I was wondering JohnWouldnt there
be a way round for the children to

Now mother interrupted the husband that aint like you Weve
crossed plenty Indian reservations this trip already

I dont want to go round the little girl said Father dont make me
go round

Mart the boy with a loose hook of hair hanging down to his eyes from
his hat did not trouble to speak He had been disappointed in the
westward journey to find all the Indians peaceful He knew which way
he should go now and he went to the wagon to look once again down the
clean barrel of his rifle

Why Nancy you dont like Indians said her mother

Yes I do I like chiefs

Mrs Clallam looked across the river It was so strange John the way
they acted It seems to get stranger thinking about it

They didnt see us They didnt have a notion

But if were going right over

Were not going over there Liza That quick waters the Mahkin Rapids
and our ferrys clear down below from this place

What could they have been after do you think

Those chaps Oh nothing I guess They werent killing anybody

Playing crosstag said Mart

Id like to know John how you know they werent killing anybody They
might have been trying to

Then were perfectly safe Liza We can set and let em kill us all
day

Well I dont think its any kind of way to behave running around
shooting right off your horse

And Fourth of July over too said Mart from the wagon He was putting
cartridges into the magazine of his Winchester His commonsense told
him that those horsemen would not cross the river but the notion of a
night attack pleased the imagination of young sixteen

It was the children said Mrs Clallam And nobodys getting me any
wood How am I going to cook supper Stir yourselves

They had carried water in the wagon and father and son went for wood
Some way down the hill they came upon a gully with some dead brush and
climbed back with this Supper was eaten on the ground the horses were
watered given grain and turned loose to find what pickings they might
in the lean growth and dusk had not turned to dark when the emigrants
were in their beds on the soft dust The noise of the rapids dominated
the air with distant sonority and the children slept at once the boy
with his rifle along his blankets edge John Clallam lay till the moon
rose hard and brilliant and then quietly lest his wife should hear
from her bed by the wagon went to look across the river Where the
downward slope began he came upon her She had been watching for some
time They were the only objects in that bald moonlight No shrub grew
anywhere that reached to the waist and the two figures drew together on
the lonely hill They stood hand in hand and motionless except that the
man bent over the woman and kissed her When she spoke of Iowa they had
left he talked of the new region of their hopes the country that lay
behind the void hills opposite where it would not be a struggle to
live He dwelt on the home they would make and her mood followed his
at last till husband and wife were building distant plans together The
Dipper had swung low when he remarked that they were a couple of fools
and they went back to their beds Cold came over the ground and their
musings turned to dreams Next morning both were ashamed of their fears

By four the wagon was on the move Inside Nancys voice was heard
discussing with her mother whether the schoolteacher where they were
going to live now would have a black dog with a white tail that could
swim with a basket in his mouth They crawled along the edge of the vast
descent making slow progress for at times the valley widened and they
receded far from the river and then circuitously drew close again where
the slant sank abruptly When the ferrymans cabin came in sight the
canvas interior of the wagon was hot in the longrisen sun The lay of
the land had brought them close above the stream but no one seemed to
be at the cabin on the other side nor was there any sign of a ferry
Groves of trees lay in the narrow folds of the valley and the water
swept black between untenanted shores Nothing living could be seen
along the scant levels of the bottomland Yet there stood the cabin as
they had been told the only one between the rapids and the Okanagon
and bright in the sun the Colville Reservation confronted them They
came upon tracks going down over the hill marks of wagons and horses
plain in the soil and charred sticks with empty cans lying where
camps had been Heartened by this proof that they were on the right
road John Clallam turned his horses over the brink The slant steepened
suddenly in a hundred yards tilting the wagon so no brake or shoe would
hold it if it moved farther

All out said Clallam Either folks travel light in this country
or they unpack He went down a little way Thats the trail too he
said Wheel marks down there and the little bushes are snapped off

Nancy slipped out Im unpacked said she Oh what a splendid hill
to go down Well go like anything

Yes that surely is the trail Clallam pursued I can see away down
where somebodys left a wheel among them big stones But where does he
keep his ferryboat And where does he keep himself

Now John if its here were to go down dont you get to studying
over something else Itll be time enough after were at the bottom
Nancy heres your chair Mrs Clallam began lifting the lighter things
from the wagon

Mart said the father well have to chain lock the wheels after
were empty I guess well start with the worst You and mell take the
stove apart and get her down somehow Were in luck to have open country
and no timber to work through Drop that bedding mother Yourself is all
youre going to carry Well pack that truck on the horses

Then pack it now and let me start first Ill make two trips while
youre at the stove

Theres the man said Nancy

A mana white manwas riding up the other side of the river Near the
cabin he leaned to see something on the ground Ten yards more and he
was off the horse and picked up something and threw it away He loitered
along picking up and throwing till he was at the door He pushed it
open and took a survey of the interior Then he went to his horse and
when they saw him going away on the road he had come they set up a
shouting and Mart fired a signal The rider dived from his saddle and
made headlong into the cabin where the door clapped to like a trap
Nothing happened further and the horse stood on the bank

Thats the funniest man I ever saw said Nancy

Theyre all funny over there said Mart Ill signal him again But
the cabin remained shut and the deserted horse turned took a few first
steels of freedom then trotted briskly down the river

Why then he dont belong there at all said Nancy

Wait child till we know something about it

Shes liable to be right Liza The horse anyway dont belong or
hed not run off Thats good judgment Nancy Right good for a little
girl

I am six years old said Nancy and I know lots more than that

Well lets get mother and the bedding started down Itll be noon
before we know it

There were two packsaddles in the wagon ready against such straits as
this The rolls were made balanced as side packs and circled with the
swingropes loose cloths clothes fryingpans the lantern and the
axe tossed in to fill the gap in the middle canvas flung over the
whole and the diamondhitch hauled taut on the first pack when a
second rider appeared across the river He came out of a space between
the opposite hills into which the trail seemed to turn and he was
leading the first mans horse The heavy work before them was forgotten
and the Clallams sat down in a row to watch

Hes stealing it said Mrs Clallam

Then the other man will come out and catch him said Nancy

Mart corrected them A man never steals horses that way He drives them
up in the mountains where the owner dont travel much

The new rider had arrived at the bank and came steadily along till
opposite the door where he paused and looked up and down the river

See him stoop said Clallam the father Hes seen the tracks dont go
further

I guess hes after the other one added Clallam the son

Which of them is the ferryman said Mrs Clallam

The man had got off and gone straight inside the cabin In the black of
the doorway appeared immediately the first man dangling in the grip of
the other who kicked him along to the horse There the victim mounted
his own animal and rode back down the river The chastiser was returning
to the cabin when Mart fired his rifle The man stopped short saw the
emigrants and waved his hand He dismounted and came to the edge of the
water They could hear he was shouting to them but it was too far for
the words to carry From a certain reiterated cadence he seemed to be
saying one thing John and Mart tried to show they did not understand
and indicated their wagon walking to it and getting aboard On that the
stranger redoubled his signs and shootings ran to the cabin where he
opened and shut the door several times came back and pointed to the
hills

Hes going away and cant ferry us over said Mrs Clallam

And the other man thought hed gone said Nancy and he came and
caught him in his house

This dont suit me Clallam remarked Mart well go to the shore and
talk to him

When the man saw them descending the hill he got on his horse and swam
the stream It carried him below but he was waiting for them when they
reached the level He was tall shambling and bony and roved over them
with a pleasant restless eye

Goodmorning said he Fine weather I was baptized Edward Wilson
but you inquire for WildGoose Jake Them other names are retired and
pensioned I expect you seen me kick him

Couldnt help seeing

Oh I aint blamin you son not a bit I aint He cant bile water
without burnin it and his toes turns in and hes blurry round the
fingernails Hes jest kultus he is Hev some With a furtive smile
that often ran across his lips he pulled out a flat bottle and all
took an acquaintanceship swallow while the Clallams explained their
journey How many air there of yu slidin down the hill he inquired
shifting his eye to the wagon

Ive got my wife and little girl up there Thats all of us

Ladies along Then Ill step behind this bush He was dragging his
feet from his waterlogged boots Hear them suck now he commented
Didnt hev to think about a wetting onced But I aint young any more
There I guess I aint caught a chill He had whipped his breeches off
and spread them on the sand Now you arrive down this here hill from
Ioway and says you Wheres that ferry Aint we hit the right
spot Well thats what you hev hit Youre all right and the spot is
hunkydory and its the durned old boat hez made the mistake begosh
A cloud busted in this country and she tore out fer the coast and the
jokes on her Youd ought to hev heerd her cable snap Whoosh if that
wire didnt screech Jest last week it was and the river come round the
corner on us in a wave four feet high same as a wall I was up here
on business and seen the whole thing So the ferry she up and bid us
goodbye and lit out for Astoria with her cargo Beggin pardon
hev you tobacco for mines in my wet pants Twentyfour hogs and the
driver and two Sheeny drummers bound to the mines with brass jewlry
all gone to hell for they didnt near git to Astoria They sank in the
sight of all as we run along the bank I seen their arms wave and them
hogs rolling over like taters bilin round in the kettle WildGoose
Jakes words came slow and went more slowly as he looked at the river
and spoke but rather to himself It warnt long though I expect it
warnt three minutes till the water was all there was left there My
stars what a lot of it And I might hev been part of that cargo easy
as not Freight behind time was all that come between me and them that
went So wed hev gone bobbin down that flood me and my piahchuck

Your piahchuck Mart inquired

The man faced the boy like a rat but the alertness faded instantly from
his eye and his lip slackened into a slipshod smile Why yes sonny
me and my grubstake Youve been to school Ill bet but they didnt
learn yu Chinook now did they Chinooks the lingo us white folks
trade in with the Siwashes and we kinder falls into it talking along
I was thinkin how but for delay me and my grubstakeprovisions ye
knowthat was consigned to me clear away at Spokane might hev been
drownded along with them hogs and Hebrews Thats what the good folks
calls a dispensation of the Sauklee TyeeProvidence ye know in
Chinook One shall be taken and the other left And thats what beats
methey got left and Im a bigger sinner than them drummers for Im
ten years older than they was And the poor hogs was better than any of
us That cant be gainsaid Oh no oh no

Mart laughed

I mean it son Some day such thoughts will come to you He stared at
the river unsteadily with his light gray eyes

Well if the ferrys gone said John Clallam getting on his legs
well go on down to the next one

Hold on hold on Did you never hear tell of a raft Ill put you folks
over this river Wait till I git my pants on said he stalking nimbly
to where they lay

Its just this way Clallam continued were bound for the upper
Okanagon country and we must get in there to build our cabin before
cold weather

Dont you worry about that Itll take you three days to the next
ferry while you and me and the boy kin build a raft right here by
tomorrow noon You hev an axe I expect Well here is timber close
and your trail takes over to my place on the Okanagon where youve got
another crossin to make And all this time were keeping the ladies
waitin up the hill Well talk business as we go along and see here
if I dont suit yu or fail in my bargain you neednt to pay me a
cent

He began climbing and on the way they came to an agreement WildGoose
Jake bowed low to Mrs Clallam and as low to Nancy who held her
mothers dress and said nothing keeping one finger in her mouth
All began emptying the wagon quickly and tins of bakingpowder with
rockingchairs and flowered quilts lay on the hill WildGoose Jake
worked hard and sustained a pleasant talk by himself His fluency was
of an eagerness that parried interruption or inquiry

So youve come acrosst the Big Bend Aint it a cosey place Reminds me
of them medicine pictures Before and After Using The Big Bends the
way this world looked before usingbefore the Bible fixed it up ye
know Ever seen specimens of Big Bend produce maam They send
em East Grain and plums and such The feller that gathered them
curiosities hed hunt forty square miles apiece for em But its
goodpayin policy and it fetches lots of settlers to the Territory
They come here hummin and walks around the wilderness and Wheres the
plums says they Cant you see Im busy says the land agent and
out they goes But you neednt to worry maam The country where youre
goin aint like that Theres water and timber and rich soil and mines
Billy Moon has gone therehes the man run the ferry When she wrecked
he pulled his freight for the new mines at Loop Loop

Did the man live in the little house said Nancy

Right there miss And nobody lives there any more so you take it if
youre wantin a place of your own

What made you kick the other man if it wasnt your house

Well now if it aint a good one on him to hev you see that Ill tell
him a little girl seen that and maybe hell feel the disgrace Only
hes no account and dont take any experience the reglar way Hes
nigh onto thirty and youll not believe me I know but he aint never
even learned to spit right

Is he yours inquired Nancy

Gosh no missbeggin pardon Hes jest workin for me

Did he know you were coming to kick him when he hid

Hid Whats that The mans eyes narrowed again into points You
folks seen him hide he said to Clallam

Why of course didnt he say anything

He didnt get much chance muttered Jake What did he hide at

Us

You begosh

I guess so said Mart We took him for the ferryman and when he
couldnt hear us

What was he doin

Just riding along And so I fired to signal him and he flew into the
door

So you fired and he flew into the door Oh hm Jake continued to
pack the second horse attending carefully to the ropes I never knowed
he was that weak in the upper story he said in about five minutes
Knew his brains was tenas but didnt suspect he were that weak in the
upper story Youre sure he didnt go in till he heerd your gun

Hed taken a look and was going away said Mart

Now aint some people jest odd Now you follow me and Ill tell you
folks what Id figured hed been at Billy Moon he lived in that cabin
yu see And he had his stuff there yu see and run the ferry and a
kind of a store He kept coffee and canned goods and starplug and this
and that to supply the prospectin outfits that come acrosst on his
ferry on the trail to the mines Then a cloudburst hits his boat and
his jobs spoiled on the river and he quits for the mines takin his
stuff alongdo you follow me But he hed to leave some and he give me
the key and I was to send the balance after him next freight team that
come along my way Leanderthats him I was kickinhe knowed about
it and hell steal a hot stove hes that dumb He knowed there was
stuff here of Billy Moons Well last night we hed some horses stray
and I says to him Andy you get up by daylight and find them And he
gits But by seven the horses come in all right of theirselves and
Mr Leander he was missin and says I to myself Ill ketch you yu
blamed hobo And I thought I had ketched him yu see Werent that
reasonable of me Wouldnt any of you folks hev drawed that conclusion
The man had fallen into a wheedling tone as he studied their faces
Jest put yourselves in my place he said

Then what was he after said Mart

Stealin But he figured hed come again

He didnt like my gun much

Guns always skeers him when he dont know the parties shootin
Thats his dumbness Maybe he thought I was after him hes jest that
distrustful Begosh well have the laugh on him when he finds he run
from a little girl

He didnt wait to see who he was running from said Mart

Of course he didnt Andy hears your gun and he dont inquire further
but hits the first hole he kin crawl into Thats Andy Thats the kind
of boy I hev to work for me All the good ones goes where youre goin
where the grain grows without irrigation and the blacktail deer comes
out on the hill and asks yu to shoot em for dinner Whos ready for
the bottom If I stay talkin the sunll go down on us Dont yu let
me get started agin Just you shet me off twiced anyway each twentyfour
hours

He began to descend with his packhorse and the first load All
afternoon they went up and down over the hot bare face of the hill
until the baggage heavy and light was transported and dropped
piecemeal on the shore The tornout insides of their home littered the
stones with familiar shapes and colors and Nancy played among them
visiting each parcel and folded thing

Theres the red tablecover she exclaimed and the big
coffeegrinder And theres our table and the hole Mart burned in it
She took a long look at this Oh how I wish I could see our pump she
said and began to cry

You talk to her mother said Clallam Shes tuckered out

The men returned to bring the wagon With chainlocked wheels and
tilted half over by the cross slant of the mountain it came heavily
down reeling and sliding on the slippery yellow weeds and grinding
deep ruts across the faces of the shelving beds of gravel Jake guided
it as he could straining back on the bits of the two hunched horses
when their hoofs glanced from the stones that rolled to the bottom
and the others leaned their weight on a pole lodged between the spokes
making a balance to the wagon for it leaned the other way so far that
at any jolt the two wheels left the ground When it was safe at the
level of the stream dusk had come and a white flat of mist lay along
the river striping its course among the gaunt hills They slept without
moving and rose early to cut logs which the horses dragged to the
shore The outside trunks were nailed and lashed with ropes and sank
almost below the surface with the weight of the wood fastened crosswise
on top But the whole floated dry with its cargo and crossed clumsily
on the quickwrinkled current Then it brought the wagon and the six
horses swam The force of the river had landed them below the cabin
and when they had repacked there was too little left of day to go on
Clallam suggested it was a good time to take Moons leavings over to
the Okanagon but WildGoose Jake said at once that their load was heavy
enough and about this they could not change his mind He made a journey
to the cabin by himself and returned saying that he had managed to lock
the door

Father said Mart as they were harnessing next day Ive been up
there I went awful early Theres no lock to the door and the cabins
empty

I guessed that might be

There has been a lock pried off pretty lately There was a lot of
broken bottles around everywheres inside and out

What do you make out of it said Mart

Nothing yet He wants to get us away and Im with him there I want to
get up the Okanagon as soon as we can

Well Im takin yu the soonest way said WildGoose Jake behind
them From his casual smile there was no telling what he had heard
Ill put your stuff acrosst the Okanagon tomorrow mornin But
tonight yourselvesll all be over and the ladies kin sleep in my
room

The wagon made good time The trail crossed easy valleys and over
the yellow grass of the hills while now and then their guide took
a shortcut He wished to get home he said since there could be no
estimating what Leander might be doing While the sun was still well up
in the sky they came over a round knob and saw the Okanagon blue in the
bright afternoon and the cabin on its further bank This was a roomier
building to see than common and a hayfield was by it and a bit
of green pasture fenced in Saddlehorses were tied in front heads
hanging and feet knuckled askew with long waiting and from inside an
uneven riotous din whiffled lightly across the river and intervening
meadow to the hill

If youll excuse me said Jake Ill jest git along ahead and see
what game them folks is puttin up on Andy Likely as not hes weighin
em out flour at two cents with it costin me two and a half on
freightin alone Ill hev supper ready time you ketch up

He was gone at once getting away at a sharp pace till presently they
could see him swimming the stream When he was in the cabin the sounds
changed dropping off to one at a time and expired But when the riders
came out into the air they leaned and collided at random whirled their
arms and screaming till they gathered heart charged with wavering
menace at the door The foremost was flung from the sill and he shot
along toppling and scraped his length in the dust while the owner of
the cabin stood in the entrance The Indian picked himself up and at
some word of Jakes which the emigrants could half follow by the fierce
lift of his arm all got on their horses and set up a wailing like
vultures driven off They went up the river a little and crossed but
did not come down this side and Mrs Clallam was thankful when their
evil noise had died away up the valley They had seen the wagon coming
but gave it no attention A man soon came over the river from the
cabin and was lounging against a tree when the emigrants drew up at the
margin

I dont know what you know he whined defiantly from the tree but
Im goin to Cornwall Connecticut and I dont care who knows it He
sent a cowed look at the cabin across the river

Get out of the wagon Nancy said Clallam Mart help her down

Im going back said the man blinking like a scolded dog I aint
stayin here for nobody You can tell him I said so too Again his eye
slunk sidewise towards the cabin and instantly back

While youre staying said Mart you might as well give a hand here

He came with alacrity and made a shift of unhitching the horses I was
better off coupling freight cars on the Housatonic he soon remarked
His voice came shallow from no deeper than his throat and a peevish
apprehension rattled through it That was a good job And Ive had
better too forty fifty sixty dollars better

Shall we unpack the wagon Clallam inquired

I dont know You ever been to New Milford I sold shoes there
Thirtyfive dollars and board

The emigrants attended to their affairs watering the horses and driving
picket stakes Leander uselessly followed behind them with conversation
blinking and with lower lip sagged showing a couple of teeth My
brothers in business in Pittsfield Massachusetts said he and I can
get a salary in Bridgeport any day I say so That a Marlin

No said Mart Its a Winchester

I had a Marlin Hes took it from me Ill bet you never got shot at

Anybody want to shoot you Mart inquired

Well and I guess youll believe they did day before yesterday

If youre talking about up at that cabin it was me

Leander gave Mart a leer That wont do said he Hes put you up to
telling me that and Im going to Cornwall Connecticut I know whats
good for me I guess

I tell you we were looking for the ferry and I signalled you across
the river

No no said Leander I never seen you in my life Dont you be like
him and take me for a fool

All right Why did they want to murder you

Why said the man shrilly Why Hadnt they broke in and filled
themselves up on his piahchuck till they were crazydrunk And when I
came along didnt they

When you came along they were nowhere near there said Mart

Now youre going to claim it was me drunk it and scattered all them
bottles of his screamed Leander backing away I tell you I didnt
I told him I didnt and he knowed it well too But hes just that mean
when hes mad he likes to put a thing on me whether or no when he never
seen me touch a drop of whiskey nor any one else neither They were
riding and shooting loose over the country like they always do on a
drunk And Im glad they stole his stuff What business had he to keep
it at Billy Moons old cabin and send me away up there to see it was all
right Let him do his own dirty work I aint going to break the laws on
the salary he pays me

The Clallam family had gathered round Leander who was stricken with
volubility It aint once in a while but its every day and every
week he went on always in a woolly scream And the longer he aint
caught the bolder he gets and puts everything that goes wrong on to me
Was it me traded them for that liquor this afternoon It was his squaw
Big Tracks and he knowed it well He lets that mudfaced baboon run the
house when hes off and I dont have the keys nor nothing and never
did have But of course he had to come in and say it was me just because
he was mad about having you see them Siwashes hollering around And he
come and shook me where I was sittin and oh my he knowed well the
lie he was acting I bet Ive got the marks on my neck now See any red
marks Leander exhibited the back of his head but the violence done
him had evidently been fleeting Hell be awful good to you for hes
that scared

Leander stood tremulously straight in silence his lip sagging as
WildGoose Jake called pleasantly from the other bank Come to supper
you folks said he Why Andy I told you to bring them across and
youve let them picket their horses Was you expectin Mrs Clallam to
take your arm and ford six feet of water For some reason his voice
sounded kind as he spoke to his assistant

Well mother said Clallam

If it was not for Nancy John

I know I know Out on the shore here on this side would be a
pleasanter bedroom for you but he looked up the valley I guess our
friends plan is more sensible tonight

So they decided to leave the wagon behind and cross to the cabin The
horses put them with not much wetting to the other bank where Jake
most eager and friendly hovered to meet his party and when they were
safe ashore pervaded his premises in their behalf

Turn them horses into the pasture Andy said he and first feed em
a couple of quarts It may have been hearing himself say this but
tone and voice dropped to the confidential and his sentences came with a
chuckle Quarts to the horses and quarts to the Siwashes and a skookum
pack of trouble all round Mrs Clallam If I hednt acame to stop it a
while ago why about all the spirits thats in stock jest now was bein
traded off for some blamed ponies the bears hev let hobble on the range
unswallered ever since I settled here A store on a trail like this
here ye see it hez to keep spirits of course andwell well heres
my room you ladiesll excuse and make yourselves at home as well as
you can

It was of a surprising neatness due all to him they presently saw the
log walls covered with a sort of bunting that was also stretched across
to make a ceiling below the shingles of the roof fresh soap and towels
china service a clean floor and bed on the wall a print of some white
and red village among elms with a covered bridge and the water running
over an aprondam just above and a rich smell of whiskey everywhere
Fix up as comfortable as yu can the host repeated and Ill see how
Mrs Jakes tossin the flapjacks Shes Injun yu know and five years
of married life hadnt learned her to toss flapjacks Now if I was you
he was lingering in the doorway I wouldnt shet that winder so quick
It dont smell nice yet for ladies in here and Id hev liked to git the
time to do better for ye but them Siwasheswell of course you folks
see how it is Maybe it aint always and only white men that patronizes
our goods Uncle Sam is a long way off and I dont say wed ought to
but when the cats away why the mice will ye knowthey most always
will

There was a rattle of boards outside at which he shut the door quickly
and they heard him run A light muttering came in at the window and the
mother peeping out saw Andy fallen among a rubbish of crates and empty
cans where he lay staring while his two fists beat up and down like a
disordered toy WildGoose Jake came and having lifted him with great
tenderness was laying him flat as Elizabeth Clallam hurried to his
help

No maam he sighed you cant do nothing I guess

Just let me go over and get our medicines

Thank you maam said Jake and the pain on his face was miserable to
see there aint no medicine Were kind of used to this Andy and me
Maybe if you wouldnt mind stayin till he comes toWhy a sick man
takes comfort at the sight of a lady

When the fit had passed they helped him to his feet and Jake led him
away

Mrs Jake made her first appearance upon the guests sitting down to
their meal when she waited on table passing busily forth from the
kitchen with her dishes She had but three or four English words and
her best years were plainly behind her but her cooking was good
fried and boiled with sticks of her own chopping and she served with
industry Indeed a squaw is one of the few species of the domestic wife
that survive today upon our continent Andy seemed now to keep all
his dislike for her and followed her with a scowling eye while he
frequented Jake drawing a chair to sit next him when he smoked by the
wall after supper and sometimes watching him with a sort of clouded
affection upon his face He did not talk and the seizure had evidently
jarred his mind as well as his frame When the squaw was about lighting
a lamp he brushed her arm in a childish way so that the match went out
and set him laughing She poured out a harangue in Chinook showing the
dead match to Jake who rose and gravely lighted the lamp himself Andy
laughing more than ever When Mrs Clallam had taken Nancy with her
to bed Jake walked John Clallam to the riverbank and looking up and
down spoke a little of his real mind

I guess you see how it is with me Anyway I dont commonly hev use
for strangerfolks in this house But that little girl of yourn started
cryin about not havin the pump along that shed been used to seein in
the yard at home And I says to myself Look ahere Jake I dont care
if they do ketch on to you and yer blamed whiskey business Theyre not
the sort to tell on you Gee but that about the pump got me And I
says Jake youre goin to give them the best you hev got Why that
Big Bend desert and lonesome valley of the Columbia hez chilled my heart
in the days that are gone when I werent used to things and the little
girl hed came so fur And I knowed how she was afeelin

He stopped and seemed to be turning matters over

Im much obliged to you said Clallam

And your wife was jest beautiful about Andy Youve saw me wicked to
Andy I am and often for I rile turruble quick and God forgive me
But when that boy gits at his meannessyuve seen jest a touch of
ittheres scarcely livin with him It seems like he got reglar
inspired Some days hell liemake up big lies to the fust man comes
in at the door They aint harmless his lies aint Then hell trick my
woman thats real good to him and I believe hed lick whiskey up off
the dirt And every drop is poison for him with his complaint But Id
ought to remember Youd surely think I could remember and forbear
Most likely he made a big talk to you about that cabin

John Clallam told him

Well thats all true for onced I did think hed been up to stealin
that whiskey gradual stead of fishin the times he was out all day
And the salary I give himJake laughed a littleaint enough to
justify a mans breaking the law I did take his rifle away when he
tried to shoot my woman I guess it was Siwashes bruck into that cabin

Im pretty certain of it said Clallam

You What makes you

John began the tale of the galloping dots and Jake stopped walking to
listen the harder Yes he said thats bad Thats jest bad They
hev carried a lot off to drink Thats the worst

He had little to say after this but talked under his tongue as they
went to the house where he offered a bed to Clallam and Mart They
would not turn him out so he showed them over to a haystack where they
crawled in and went to sleep

Most white men know when they have had enough whiskey Most Indians
do not This is a difference between the races of which government
has taken notice Government says that no ardent spirits shall be
introduced under any presence into the Indian country It also says
that the white man who attempts to break this law shall be punished by
imprisonment for not more than two years and by a fine of not more than
three hundred dollars It further says that if any superintendent of
Indian affairs has reason to suspect a man he may cause the boats
stores packages wagons sleds and places of deposit of such person
to be searched and if ardent spirits be found it shall be forfeit
together with the boats and all other substances with it connected one
half to the informer and the other half to the use of the United States
The courts and all legal machines necessary for trial and punishment of
offenders are oiled and ready two years is a long while in jail three
hundred dollars and confiscation sounds heavy altogether the penalty
looks severe on the printed pageand all the while theres no brisker
success in our far West than selling whiskey to Indians Very few people
know what the whiskey is made of and the Indian does not care He
drinks till he drops senseless If he has killed nobody and nobody him
during the process it is a good thing for then the matter ends with
his getting sober and going home to his tent till such happy time when
he can put his hand on some further possession to trade away The white
offender is caught now and then but Okanagon County lies pretty snug
from the arm of the law Its against Canada to the north and the empty
county of Stevens to the east south of it rushes the Columbia with
the naked horrible Big Bend beyond and to its west rises a domain
of unfooted mountains There is law up in the top of it at Conconully
sometimes but not much even today for that is still a new country
where flow the Methow the Ashinola and the Similikameen

Consequently a cabin like WildGoose Jakes was a holiday place The
blanketed denizens of the reservation crossed to it and the citizens
who had neighboring cabins along the trail repaired here to spend what
money they had As Mrs Clallam lay in her bed she heard customers
arrive Two or three loud voices spoke in English and several Indians
and squaws seemed to be with the party bantering in Chinook The
visitors were in too strong force for Jakes word about coming some
other night to be of any avail

Open your cellar and quit your talk Elizabeth heard and next she
heard some door that stuck pulled open with a shriek of the warped
timber Next they were gambling and made not much noise over it at
first but the Indians in due time began to lose to the soberer whites
becoming quarrelsome and raising a clumsy disturbance though it was
plain the whites had their own way and were feared The voices rose and
soon there was no moment that several were not shouting curses at once
till Mrs Clallam stopped her ears She was still for a time hearing
only in a muffled way when all at once the smell of drink and tobacco
that had sifted only a little through the cracks grew heavy in the
room and she felt Nancy shrink close to her side

Mother mother the child whispered whats that

It had gone beyond cardplaying with the company in the saloon they
seemed now to be having a savage horseplay those on their feet
tramping in their scuffles upon others on the floor who bellowed
incoherently Elizabeth Clallam took Nancy in her arms and told her that
nobody would come where they were

But the child was shaking Yes they will she whispered in terror
They are And she began a tearless sobbing holding her mother with
her whole strength

A little sound came close by the bed and Elizabeths senses stopped so
that for half a minute she could not stir She stayed rigid beneath the
quilt and Nancy clung to her Something was moving over the floor It
came quite near but turned and its slight rustle crawled away towards
the window

Who is that demanded Mrs Clallam sitting up

There was no answer but the slow creeping continued always close along
the floor like the folds of stuff rubbing and hands feeling their way
in short slides against the boards She had no way to find where her
husband was sleeping and while she thought of this and whether or not
to rush out at the door the table was gently shaken there was a drawer
opened and some object fell

Only a thief she said to herself and in a sort of sharp joy cried
out her question again

The singular broken voice of a woman answered seemingly in fear
Matches it said and Matches said a second voice pronouncing
with difficulty like the first She knew it was some of the squaws and
sprang from the bed asking what they were doing there Matches
they murmured and when she had struck a light she saw how the two were
cringing their blankets huddled round them Their motionless black eyes
looked up at her from the floor where they lay sprawled making no offer
to get up It was clear to her from the pleading fear in the one word
they answered to whatever she said that they had come here to hide from
the fury of the next room and as she stood listening to this she would
have let them remain but their escape had been noticed A man burst
into the room and at sight of her and Nancy stopped and was blundering
excuses when Jake caught his arm and had dragged him almost out but he
saw the two on the floor at this getting himself free he half swept
the crouching figures with his boot as they fled out of the room and
the door was swung shut Mrs Clallam heard his violent words to the
squaws for daring to disturb the strangers and there followed the heavy
lashing of a quirt with screams and lamenting No trouble came from the
Indian husbands for they were stupefied on the ground and when their
intelligences quickened enough for them to move the punishment was
long over and no one in the house awake but Elizabeth and Nancy seated
together in their bed watching for the day Mother and daughter heard
them rise to go out one by one and the hoofbeats of their horses grew
distant up and down the river As the rustling trees lighted and turned
transparent in the rising sun Jake roused those that remained and got
them away Later he knocked at the door

I hev a little raft fixed this morning said he and I guess we can
swim the wagon over here

Whatevers quickest to take us from this place Elizabeth answered

Breakfastll be ready maam whenever you say

I am ready now I shall want to start ferrying our thingsWheres Mr
Clallam Tell him to come here

I will maam Im sorry

Tell Mr Clallam to come here please

John had slept sound in his haystack and heard nothing Well he
said after comforting his wife and Nancy you were better off in the
room anyway Id not blame him so Liza How was he going to help it

But Elizabeth was a woman and just now saw one thing alone if selling
whiskey led to such things in this country the man who sold it was much
worse than any mere lawbreaker John Clallam being now a long time
married made no argument He was looking absently at the open drawer of
a table Thats queer he said and picked up a tintype

She had no curiosity for anything in that room and he laid it in the
drawer again his thoughts being taken up with the next step of their
journey and what might be coming to them all

During breakfast Jake was humble about the fright the ladies had
received in his house explaining how he thought he had acted for the
best at which Clallam and Mart said that in a rough country folks must
look for rough doings and get along as well as they can but Elizabeth
said nothing The little raft took all but Nancy over the river to the
wagon where they set about dividing their belongings in loads that
could be floated back one at a time and Jake returned to repair some
of the disorder that remained from the night at the cabin John and Mart
poled the first cargo across and while they were on the other side
Elizabeth looked out of the wagon where she was working alone and saw
five Indian riders coming down the valley The dust hung in the air they
had rushed through and they swung apart and closed again as she had
seen before so she looked for a rifle but the firearms had gone over
the Okanagon with the first load She got down and stood at the front
wheel of the wagon confronting the riders when they pulled up their
horses One climbed unsteadily from his saddle and swayed towards her

Drink said he half friendly and held out a bottle

Elizabeth shook her head

Drink he grunted again pushing the bottle at her Piahchuck
Skookurn He had a slugglish animal grin and when she drew back
tipped the bottle into his mouth and directly choked so that his
friends on their horses laughed loud as he stood coughing Heap good
he remarked looking at Elizabeth who watched his eyes swim with the
plot of the drink Where you come back he inquired touching the
wagon You cross Okanagon Me cross you cross horses cross all Heap
cheap What yes

The others nodded Heap cheap they said

We dont want you said Elizabeth

No cross Maybe he going cross you What yes

Again Elizabeth nodded

Maybe he Jake pursued the Indian

Yes he is We dont want you

We cross you all same He not

The Indian spoke loud and thick and Elizabeth looked over the river
where her husband was running with a rifle and Jake behind him holding
a warning hand on his arm Jake called across to the Indians who
listened sullenly but got on their horses and went up the river

Now said Jake to Clallam they aint gone Get your wife over here
so she kin set in my room till I see what kin be done

John left him at once and crossed on the raft His wife was stepping on
it when the noise and flight of riders descended along the other bank
where Jake was waiting They went in a circle with hoarse shouts round
the cabin as Mart with Nancy came from the pasture The boy no sooner
saw them than he caught his sister up and carried her quickly away among
the corrals and sheds where the two went out of sight

You stay here Liza her husband said Ill go back over

But Mrs Clallam laughed

Get ashore he cried to her Quick

Where you go I go John

What good what good in the name

Then Ill get myself over said she And he seized her as she would
have jumped into the stream

While they crossed the Indians had tied their horses and rambled into
the cabin Jake came from it to stop the Clallams

Theyre after your contract said he quietly They say theyre going
to have the job of takin the balance of your stuff thats left acrosst
the Okanagon over to this side

What did you say asked Mrs Clallam

I set em up drinks to gain time

Do you want me there said Clallam

Begosh no That would mix things worse

Cant you make them go away Elizabeth inquired

Me and them ye see maam we hev a sort of bargain theyre to git
certain ferryin I cant make em savvy how I took charge of you If
you want them He paused

We want them exclaimed Elizabeth If youre joking its a poor
joke

It aint no joke at all maam Jakes face grew brooding Of course
folks kin say who theyll be ferried by And you may believe Id rather
do it I didnt look for jest this complication but maybe I kin steer
through and its myself Ive got to thank Of course if them Siwashes
did git your job theyd sober up gittin ready And

The emigrants waited but he did not go on with what was in his mind
Its all right said he in a brisk tone Whatevers acomins
acomin He turned abruptly towards the door Keep yerselves away
jest now he added and went inside

The parents sought their children finding Mart had concealed Nancy in
the haystack They put Mrs Clallam also in a protected place as a
loud altercation seemed to be rising at the cabin this grew as they
listened and Jakes squaw came running to hide herself She could tell
them nothing nor make them understand more than they knew but she
touched Johns rifle signing to know if it were loaded and was
greatly relieved when he showed her the magazine full of cartridges
The quarrelling had fallen silent but rose in a new gust of fierceness
sounding as if in the open air and coming their way No Indian appeared
however and the noise passed to the river where the emigrants soon
could hear wood being split in pieces

John risked a survey Its the raft he said Theyre smashing it
Now theyre going back Stay with the children Liza

Youre never going to that cabin she said

Hes in a scrape mother

John started away heedless of his wifes despair At his coming the
Indians shouted and surrounded him while he heard Jake say Drop your
gun and drink with them

Drink said Andy laughing with the same screech he had made at the
match going out We re all going to Canaan Connecticut

Each Indian held a tin cup and at the instant these were emptied
they were thrust towards Jake who filled them again going and coming
through a door that led a step or two down into a dark place which was
half underground Once he was not quick or was imagined to be refusing
for an Indian raised his cup and drunkenly dashed it on Jakes head
Jake laughed goodhumoredly and filled the cup

Its our one chance said he to John as the Indian propping himself
by a hand on the wall offered the whiskey to Clallam

We cross you Okanagon he said What yes

Maybe you say no said another pressing the emigrant to the wall

A third interfered saying something in their language at which the
other two disagreed They talked a moment with threatening rage till
suddenly all drew pistols At this the two remaining stumbled among the
group and a shot went into the roof Jake was there in one step with
a keg that they no sooner saw than they fell upon it and the liquor
jetted out as they clinched wrestling over the room till one lay on
his back with his mouth at the open bung It was wrenched from him and
directly there was not a drop more in it They tilted it and when none
ran out flung the keg out of doors and crowded to the door of the dark
place where Jake barred the way Dont take to that yet he said to
Clallam for John was lifting his rifle

Piahchuck yelled the Indians scarcely able to stand All other
thought had left them and a new thought came to Jake He reached for a
fresh keg while they held their tin cups in the left hand and pistols
in the right pushing so it was a slow matter to get the keg opened
They were fast nearing the sodden stage and one sank on the floor Jake
glanced in at the door behind him and filled the cups once again While
all were drinking he went in the storeroom and set more liquor open
beckoning them to come as they looked up from the rims to which their
lips had been glued They moved round behind the table grasping it to
keep on their feet with the one on the floor crawling among the legs
of the rest When they were all inside Jake leaped out and locked the
door

They kin sleep now said he Gunpowder wont be needed Keep wide
away from in front

There was a minute of stillness within and then a groveling noise and
struggle A couple of bullets came harmless through the door Those
inside fought together as well as they could while those outside
listened as it grew less the bodies falling stupefied without further
sound of rising One or two still active began striking at the boards
with what heavy thing they could find until suddenly the blade of an
axe crashed through

Keep away cried Jake But Andy had leaped insanely in front of the
door and fell dead with a bullet through him With a terrible scream
Jake flung himself at the place and poured six shots through the panel
then as Clallam caught him wrenched at the lock and they saw inside
Whiskey and blood dripped together and no one was moving there It
was liquor with some and death with others and all of it lay upon the
guilty soul of Jake

You deserve killing yourself said Clallam

Thats been attended to replied Jake and he reeled for during his
fire some Indian had shot once more

Clallam supported him to the room where his wife and Nancy had passed
the night and laid him on the bed Ill get Mrs Clallam said he

If shell be willin to see me said the wounded man humbly

She came dazed beyond feeling any horror or even any joy and she did
what she could

It was seein em hit Andy said Jake Is Andy gone Yes I kin tell
hes gone from your face He shut his eyes and lay still so long a
time that they thought he might be dying now but he moved at length
and looked slowly round the wall till he saw the print of the village
among the elms and the covered bridge His hand lifted to show them
this Thats the road said he Andy and me used to go fishin
acrosst that bridge Did you ever see the Housatonic River Ive fished
a lot there Cornwall Connecticut The hills are pretty there Then
Andy got worse You look in that drawer John remembered and when he
got out the tintype Jake stretched for it eagerly His mother and him
age ten he explained to Elizabeth and held it for her to see then
studied the faces in silence You kin tell its Andy cant yu She
told him yes That was before we knowed he werentwerent goin to
grow up like the other boys he played with So after a while when she
was gone I got ashamed seein Andys friends makin their way when
he couldnt seem to and so I took him away where nobody hed ever been
acquainted with us I was layin money by to get him the best doctor in
Europe I aint been a good man

A faintness mastered him and Elizabeth would have put the picture
on the table but his hand closed round it They let him lie so and
Elizabeth sat there while John with Mart kept Nancy away till the
horror in the outer room was made invisible They came and went quietly
and Jake seemed in a deepening torpor once only rousing suddenly to
call his sons name and then upon looking from one to the other he
recollected and his eyes closed again His mind wandered but very
little for torpor seemed to be overcoming him The squaw had stolen in
and sat cowering and useless Towards sundown Johns heart sickened at
the sound of more horsemen but it was only two white men a sheriff and
his deputy

Go easy said John Hes not going to resist

Whats up here anyway Who are you

Clallam explained and was evidently not so much as half believed

If there are Indians killed said the sheriff theres still another
matter for the law to settle with him Were sent to search for whiskey
The countys about tired of him

Youll find him pretty sick said John

People I find always are pretty sick said the sheriff and pushed
his way in stopping at sight of Mrs Clallam and the figure on the bed
Im arresting that man madam he said with a shade of apology The
county court wants him

Jake sat up and knew the sheriff Youre a little late Proctor said
he The Supreme Courts agoin to call my case Then he fell back
for his case had been called




Hanks Woman


I

Many fish were still in the pool and though luck seemed to have left
me still I stood at the end of the point casting and casting my vain
line while the Virginian lay and watched Noondays extreme brightness
had left the river and the plain in cooling shadow but spread and
glowed over the yet undimmed mountains Westward the Tetons lifted
their peaks pale and keen as steel through the high radiant air Deep
down between the blue gashes of their canons the sun sank long shafts of
light and the glazed laps of their snowfields shone separate and white
upon their lofty vastness like handkerchiefs laid out to dry Opposite
above the valley rose that other range the Continental Divide not
sharp but long and ample It was bare in some high places and below
these it stretched everywhere high and low in brown and yellow parks
or in purple miles of pine a world of serene undulations a great sweet
country of silence

A passing band of antelope stood herded suddenly together at sight of
us then a little breeze blew for a moment from us to them and
they drifted like phantoms away and were lost in the levels of the
sagebrush

If humans could do like that said the Virginian watching them go

Run you mean said I

Tell a foe by the smell of him explained the cowpuncher at fifty
yardsor a mile

Yes I said men would be hard to catch

A woman needs it most he murmured He lay down again in his lounging
sprawl with his grave eyes intently fixed upon my flycasting

The gradual day mounted up the hills farther from the floor of earth
Warm airs eddied in its wake slowly stirring the scents of the plain
together I looked at the Southerner and there was no guessing what
his thoughts might be at work upon behind that drowsy glance Then for a
moment a trout rose but only to look and whip down again into the pool
that wedged its calm into the riffle from below

Second thoughts mused the Virginian and as the trout came no more
Second thoughts he repeated and even a fish will have them sooner
than folks has them in this mighty hasty country And he rolled over
into a new position of ease

At whom or what was he aiming these shafts of truth Or did he moralize
merely because health and the weather had steeped him in that serenity
which lifts us among the spheres Well sometimes he went on from these
beginnings and told me wonderful things

I reckon said he presently that knowing when to change your mind
would be pretty near knowledge enough for plain people

Since my acquaintance with himthis was the second summer of itI had
come to understand him enough to know that he was unfathomable Still
for a moment it crossed my thoughts that perhaps now he was discoursing
about himself He had allowed a jealous foreman to fall out with him at
Sunk Creek ranch in the spring during Judge Henrys absence The man
having a brief authority parted with him The Southerner had chosen
that this should be the means of ultimately getting the foreman
dismissed and himself recalled It was strategic As he put it to me
When I am gone it will be right easy for the Judge to see which of
us two he wants And Ill not have done any talking All of which duly
befell in the autumn as he had planned the foreman was sent off
his assistant promoted and the Virginian again hired But this was
meanwhile He was indulging himself in a several months drifting and
while thus drifting he had written to me That is how we two came to be
on our way from the railroad to hunt the elk and the mountainsheep
and were pausing to fish where Buffalo Fork joins its waters with Snake
River In those days the antelope still ran there in hundreds the
Yellowstone Park was a new thing and mankind lived very far away Since
meeting me with the horses in Idaho the Virginian had been silent even
for him So now I stood casting my fly and trusting that he was not
troubled with second thoughts over his strategy

Have yu studded much about marriage he now inquired His serious
eyes met mine as he lay stretched along the ground

Not much I said not very much

Lets swim he said They have changed their minds

Forthwith we shook off our boots and dropped our few clothes and
heedless of what fish we might now drive away we went into the cool
slow deep breadth of backwater which the bend makes just there As
he came up near me shaking his head of black hair the cowpuncher was
smiling a little

Not that any number of baths he remarked would conceal a mans
objectionableness from an antelopenot even a sheone

Then he went under water and came up again a long way off

We dried before the fire without haste To need no clothes is better
than purple and fine linen Then he tossed the flapjacks and I served
the trout and after this we lay on our backs upon a buffalohide to
smoke and watch the Tetons grow more solemn as the large stars opened
out over the sky

I dont care if I never go home said I

The Virginian nodded It gives all the peace o being asleep with all
the pleasure o feeling the widest kind of awake said he Yu might
say the whole years strength flows hearty in every waggle of your
thumb We lay still for a while How many things surprise yu any
more he next asked

I began considering but his silence had at length worked round to
speech

Inventions of course said he these hyeh telephones an truck yu
see so much about in the papersbut I aint speaking o such things
of the brain It is just the common things I mean The things that a
livin noticin man is liable to see and maybe sample for himself How
many o them kind can surprise yu still

I still considered

Most everything surprised me onced the cowpuncher continued in his
gentle Southern voice I must have been a mighty green boy Till I
was fourteen or fifteen I expect I was astonished by ten oclock every
morning But a man begins to ketch on to folks and things after a while
I dont consideh that whenthat afteh a man is say twentyfive it is
creditable he should get astonished too easy And so yuve not examined
yourself thataway

I had not

Well theres two things anywayI know them for surethat I expect
will always get medont care if I live to thirtyfive or fortyfive
or eighty And ones the ways lightning can strike He paused Then
he got up and kicked the fire and stood by it staring at me And the
other is the people that other people will marry

He stopped again and I said nothing

The people that other people will marry he repeated That will
surprise me till I die

If my sympathy I began

But the brief sound that he gave was answer enough and more than enough
cure for my levity

No said he reflectively not any such thing as a famly for me
yet Never it may be Not till I cant help it And that woman has
not come along so far But I have been sorry for a woman lately I keep
thinking what she will do For she will have to do something Do yu
know Austrians Are they quick in their feelings like Italians Or
are they apt to be sluggish same as Norwegians and them other
Dutchspeakin races

I told him what little I knew about Austrians

This woman is the first I have ever saw of em he continued Of
course men will stampede into marriage in this hyeh Western country
where a woman is a scanty thing It aint what Hank has done that
surprises me And it is not on him that the sorrow will fall For she is
good She is very good Do yu remember little black Hank From Texas he
claims he is He was working on the main ditch over at Sunk Creek last
summer when that Emly hen was around Well seh yu would not have
pleasured in his company And this year Hank is placermining on Galena
Creek where well likely go for sheep Theres Honey Wiggin and a young
fello named Lin McLean and some others along with the outfit But
Hanks woman will not look at any of them though the McLean boy is a
likely hand I have seen that for I have done a right smart o business
thataway myself here and there She will mend their clothes for them
and she will cook lunches for them any time o day and her conduct gave
them hopes at the start But I reckon Austrians have good religion

No better than Americans said I

But the Virginian shook his head Bettern what Ive saw any Americans
have Of course I am not judging a whole nation by one citizen and
especially her a woman And of course in them big Austrian towns the
folks has shook their virtuous sayins loose from their daily doins
same as we have I expect selling yourself brings the quickest returns
to man or woman all the world over But I am speakin not of towns but
of the back country where folks dont just merely arrive on the cyars
but come into the world the natural way and grow up slow Onced a week
anyway they see the bunch of old gravestones that marks their famly
Their blood and name are knowed about in the neighborhood and its not
often one of such will sell themselves But their religion aint to them
like this womans They can be ripsnortin ortnary in ways Now she
is getting naught but hindrance and temptation and meanness from her
husband and every livin thing around heryet she keeps right along
nor does she mostly bear any signs in her face She has certnly come
from where they are used to believing in God and a hereafter mighty
hard and all day long She has got one o them crucifixes and Hank
cant make her quit prayin to it But what is she going to do

He will probably leave her I said

Yes said the Virginianleave her Alone her money all spent
knowin maybe twenty words of English and thousands of miles away
from everything she can understand For our words and ways is all alike
strange to her

Then why did he want such a person I exclaimed

There was surprise in the grave glance which the cowpuncher gave me
Why any man would he answered I wanted her myself till I found
she was good

I looked at this son of the wilderness standing thoughtful and splendid
by the fire and unconscious of his own religion that had unexpectedly
shone forth in these last words But I said nothing for words too
intimate especially words of esteem put him invariably to silence

I had forgot to mention her looks to yu he pursued simply She is
fit for a man He stopped again

Then there was her wages that Hank saw paid to her he resumed And
so marriage was but a little thing to Hankagaynst such a heap of
advantages As for her idea in takin such as himmaybe it was that he
was small and she was big tall and big Or maybe it was just his white
teeth Them ridiculous reasons will bring a woman to a man havent
yu noticed But maybe it was just her sorrowful helpless state left
stranded as she was and him keeping himself near her and sober for a
week

I had been seein this hyeh Yellowstone Park takin in its geysers
and this and that for my enjoyment and when I found what they claimed
about its strange sights to be pretty near so I landed up at Galena
Creek to watch the boys prospectin Honey Wiggin yu know and McLean
and the rest And so they got me to go down with Hank to Gardner for
flour and sugar and truck which we had to wait for We lay around the
Mammoth Springs and Gardner for three days playin cyards with friends
And I got plumb interested in them tourists For I had partly forgot
about Eastern people And hyeh they came fresh every day to remind a man
of the great size of his country Most always they would talk to yu if
yu gave em the chance and I did I have come mighty nigh regrettin
that I did not keep a tally of the questions them folks asked me And
as they seemed genuwinely anxious to believe anything at all and the
worser the thing the believinger theyd grow why Iwell theres times
when I have got to lie to keep in good health

So I fooled and I fooled And one noon I was on the front poach of the
big hotel they have opened at the Mammoth Springs for tourists and the
hotel kid bein on the watchout he sees the dust comin up the hill
and he yells out Stage

Yuve not saw that hotel yet seh Well when the kid says Stage the
consequences is most sudden About as conspicuous yu may say as when
Old Faithful Geyser lets loose Yu see one batch o tourists pulls
out right after breakfast for Norris Basin leavin things empty and
yawnin By noon the whole hotel outfit has been slumberin in its
chairs steady for three hours Maybe yu might hear a fly buzz but
maybe not Everythings liable to be restin barrin the kid Hes
awatchin out Then he sees the dust and he says Stage and it
touches the folks off like a hot pokeh The Syndicate manager he lopes
to a lookinglass and then organizes himself behind the book and the
young photograph chap bounces out o his private door like one o them
cuckoo clocks and the fossil man claws his specimens and curiosities
into shape and the porters line up same as parade and away goes the
piano and fiddles upstairs It is mighty conspicuous So Hank he come
rennin out from somewheres too and the stage drives up

Then out gets a tall woman and I noticed her yello hair She was
kind o dumbeyed yet fine to see I reckon Hank noticed her too right
away And right away her trouble begins For she was a ladys maid and
her lady was out of the stage and roundin her up quick And its
Where have you put the keys Willomene The lady was rich and stinkin
lookin and had come from New Yawk in her husbands private cyar

Well Willomene fussed around in her pockets and them keys was not
there So she started explaining in tanglefoot English to her lady how
her lady must have took them from her before leavin the cyar But the
lady seemed to relish hustlin herself into a rage She got tolerable
conspicuous too And after a heap o words You are discharged she
says and off she struts Soon her husband came out to Willomene still
standin like statuary and he pays her a good sum of cash and he goes
away and she keeps a standing yet for a spell Then all of a sudden
she says something I reckon was O Jesus and sits down and starts a
cryin

I would like to have given her comfort But we all stood around on the
hotel poach and the right thing would not come into my haid Then the
baggagewagon came in from Cinnabar and they had picked the keys up on
the road between Cinnabar and Gardner So the lady and her toilet was
rescued but that did no good to Willomene They stood her trunk down
along with the resta brassnailed little old concernand there was
Willomene out of a job and afoot a long long ways from her own range
and so she kept sitting and onced in a while shed cry some more We
got her a room in the cheap hotel where the Park drivers sleeps when
theyre in at the Springs and she acted grateful like thanking the
boys in her tanglefoot English Next mawnin her folks druv off in a
private team to Norris Basin and she seemed dazed For I talked with
her then and questioned her as to her wishes but she could not say
what she wished nor if it was East or West she would go and I reckon
she was too stricken to have wishes

Our stuff for Galena Creek delayed on the railroad and I got to know
her and then I quit givin Hank cause for jealousy I kept myself with
the boys and I played more cyards while Hank he scacely played at
all One night I came on themHank and Willomenewalkin among the
pines where the road goes down the hill Yu should have saw that pair
o lovers Her big shape was plain and kind o steadfast in the moon
and alongside of her little black Hank And there it was Of course it
aint nothing to be surprised at that a mean and triflin man tries to
seem what he is not when he wants to please a good woman But why does
she get fooled when its so plain to other folks that are not givin
it any special thought All the rest of the men and women at the Mammoth
understood Hank They knowed he was a worthless proposition And I
certnly relied on his gettin back to his whiskey and openin her eyes
that way But he did not I met them next evening again by the Liberty
Cap Supposin Id been her brother or her mother what use was it me
warning her Brothers and mothers dont get believed

The railroad brought the stuff for Galena Creek and Hank would
not look at it on account of his courtin I took it alone myself by
Yanceys and the second bridge and Miller Creek to the camp nor
I didnt tell Willomene goodbye for I had got disgusted at her
blindness

The Virginian shifted his position and jerked his overalls to a more
comfortable fit Then he continued

They was married the Tuesday after at Livingston and Hank must
have been powful pleased at himself For he gave Willomene a wedding
present with the balance of his cash spending his last nickel on
buying her a redtailed parrot they had for sale at the First National
Bank The sonofagun hollad so freely at the bank the president
awded the cashier to get shed of the outragious bird or he would
wring its neck

So Hank and Willomene stayed a week up in Livingston on her money and
then he fetched her back to Gardner and bought their grub and bride
and groom came up to the camp we had on Galena Creek

She had never slep out before She had never been on a hawss neither
And she mighty near rolled off down into Pitchstone Canyon comin up by
the cutoff trail Why seh I would not willingly take you through that
place except yu promised me yu would lead your hawss when I said
to But Hank takes the woman he had married and he takes heavyloaded
packhawsses Tis the first time such a thing has been known of in the
country Yu remember them big tall grasstopped mountains over in the
Hoodoo country and how they descends slam down through the crosstimber
that yu cant scatcely work through afoot till they pitches over into
lots an lots o little canyons with maybe two inches of water runnin
in the bottom All that is East Fork water and over the divide is
Clarks Fork or Stinkin Water if yu take the country yondeh to the
southeast But any place yu go is them undesirable steep slopes and
the cutoff trail takes along about the worst in the business

Well Hank he got his outfit over it somehow and gentlemen hush
but yud ought tve seen him and that poor girl pull into our camp Yud
certnly never have conjectured them two was a weddin journey He was
leadin but skewed around in his saddle to jaw back at Willomene for
riding so ignorant Suppose it was a thing she was responsible for yud
not have talked to her thataway even in private and hyeh was the
camp alookin and alistenin and some of us ashamed She was setting
straddleways like a mountain and between him and her went the three
packanimals plumb shiverin played out and the flourthey had two
hundred poundstilted over hellwards with the redtailed parrot
shoutin landslides in his cage tied on top o the leanin sacks

It was that mean to see that shameless and unkind that even a
thoughtless kid like the McLean boy felt offended and favorable to some
sort of remonstrance The sonofa he said to me The sonofa
If he dont stop lets stop him And I reckon we might have

But Hank he quit Twas plain to see hed got a genuwine scare comin
through Pitchstone Canyon and it turned him sour so hed hardly talk
to us but just mumbled How kind o gruff when the boys come up to
congratulate him as to his marriage

But Willomene she says when she saw me Oh I am so glad and we
shook hands right friendly And I wished Id told her goodbye that
day at the Mammoth For she bore no spite and maybe I had forgot her
feelings in thinkin of my own I had talked to her down at the
Mammoth at first yu know and she said a word about old friends
Our friendship was three weeks old that day but I expect her new
experiences looked like years to her And she told me how near she come
to gettin killed

Yu aint ever been over that trail seh Yu certnly must see
Pitchstone Canyon But well not go there with packs And we will get
off our hawsses a good ways back For many animals feels that theres
something the matter with that place and they act very strange about
it

The Grand Canyon is grand and makes yu feel good to look at it and
a geyser is grand and all right too But this hyeh Pitchstone hole
if Willomene had went down into thatwell Ill tell yu that you may
judge

She seen the trail adrawin nearer and nearer the aidge between the
timber and the jumpinoff place and she seen how them little loose
stones and the crumble stuff would slide and slide away under the
hawsss feet She could hear the stuff rattlin continually from his
steps and when she turned her haid to look she seen it goin down
close beside her but into what it went she could not see Only there
was a queer steam would come up now and agayn and her hawss trembled
So she tried to get off and walk without sayin nothin to Hank He kep
on ahaid and her hawss she had pulled up started to follo as she was
half off him and that gave her a tumble but there was an old crooked
dead tree It growed right out o the aidge There she hung

Down below is a little green water tricklin green as the stuff that
gets on brass and tricklin along over soft creamcolored formation
like pie And it aint so far to fall but what a man might not be
too much hurt for crawlin out But there aint no crawlin out o
Pitchstone Canyon they say Down in there is caves that yu cannot see
Tis them that coughs up the stream now and agayn With the wind yu
can smell em a mile away and in the night I have been layin quiet and
heard em Not that its a big noise even when a man is close up
Its a fluffy kind of a sigh But it sounds as if some awful thing
was amakin it deep down in the guts of the world They claim theres
poison air comes out o the caves and lays low along the water They
claim if a bear or an elk strays in from below and the caves sets up
their coughin which they dont regular every day the animals die I
have seen it come in two seconds And when it comes thataway risin
upon yu with that fluffy kind of a sigh yu feel mighty lonesome seh

So Hank he happened to look back and see Willomene hangin at the aidge
o them black rocks And his scare made him mad And his mad stayed
with him till they come into camp She looked around and when she seen
Hanks tent that him and her was to sleep in she showed surprise And he
showed surprise when he see the bread she cooked

What kind of a Dutch woman are yu says he strainin for a joke
if yu cant use a Dutchoven

You say to me you have a house to live in says Willomene Where is
that house

I did not figure on gettin a woman when I left camp says Hank
grinnin but not pleasant or Id have hurried up with the shack Im a
buildin

He was buildin one When I left Galena Creek and come away from that
country to meet you the house was finished enough for the couple to
move in I hefted her brassnailed trunk up the hill from their tent
myself and I watched her take out her crucifix But she would not let
me help her with that Shed not let me touch it Shed fixed it up
agaynst the wall her own self her own way But she accepted some flowers
I picked and set them in a can front of the crucifix Then Hank he come
in and seein says to me Are you one of the kind that squats before
them silly dolls I would tell yu I answered him but it would not
interest yu And I cleared out and left him and Willomene to begin
their housekeepin

Already they had quit havin much to say to each other down in their
tent The only steady talkin done in that house was done by the parrot
Ive never saw any go ahaid of that bird I have told yu about Hank
and how when hed come home and see her prayin to that crucifix hed
always get riled up He would mention it freely to the boys Not that
she neglected him yu know She done her part workin mighty hard for
she was a willin woman But he could not make her quit her religion
and Willomene she had got to bein very silent before I come away She
used to talk to me some at first but she dropped it I dont know
why I expect maybe it was hard for her to have us that close in camp
witnessin her troubles every day and she a foreigner I reckon if she
got any comfort it would be when we was off prospectin or huntin and
she could shut the cabin door and be alone

The Virginian stopped for a moment

It will soon be a month since I left Galena Creek he resumed But I
cannot get the business out o my haid I keep a studyin over it

His talk was done He had unburdened his mind Night lay deep and quiet
around us with no sound far or near save Buffalo Fork plashing over
its riffle


II

We left Snake River We went up Pacific Creek and through Two Ocean
Pass and down among the watery willowbottoms and beaverdams of the
Upper Yellowstone We fished we enjoyed existence along the lake Then
we went over Pelican Creek trail and came steeply down into the giant
country of grasstopped mountains At dawn and dusk the elk had begun to
call across the stillness And one morning in the Hoodoo country
where we were looking for sheep we came round a jut of the strange
organpipe formation upon a longlegged boy of about nineteen also
hunting

Still hyeh said the Virginian without emotion

I guess so returned the boy equally matteroffact Yu seem to be
around yourself he added

They might have been nextdoor neighbors meeting in a town street for
the second time in the same day

The Virginian made me known to Mr Lin McLean who gave me a brief nod

Any luck he inquired but not of me

Oh drawled the Virginian luck enough

Knowing the ways of the country I said no word It was bootless to
interrupt their own methods of getting at what was really in both their
minds

The boy fixed his wideopen hazel eyes upon me Fine weather he
mentioned

Very fine said I

I seen your horses a while ago he said Camp far from here he
asked the Virginian

Not specially Stay and eat with us Weve got elk meat

Thats what Im after for camp said McLean All of us is out on a
hunt todayexcept him

How many are yu now

The whole six

Makin money

Oh some days the gold washes out good in the pan and others its that
fine itll float off without settlin

So Hank aint huntin today

Huntin We left him layin out in that clump obrush below their
cabin Been drinkin all night

The Virginian broke off a piece of the Hoodoo mudrock from the weird
eroded pillar that we stood beside He threw it into a bank of last
years snow We all watched it as if it were important Up through the
mountain silence pierced the long quivering whistle of a bullelk It
was like an unearthly singer practising an unearthly scale

First time she heard that said McLean she was scared

Nothin maybe to resemble it in Austria said the Virginian

Thats so said McLean Thats so you bet Nothin just like Hank
over there neither

Well flesh is mostly flesh in all lands I reckon said the
Virginian I expect yu can be drunk and disorderly in every language
But an Austrian Hank would be liable to respect her crucifix

Thats so

He aint made her quit it yet

Not him But hes got meaner

Drunk this mawnin yu say

Thats his most harmless condition now

Nobodys in camp but them two Her and him alone

Oh he dassent touch her

Who did he tell that to

Oh the camp is backin her The camp has explained that to him several
times you bet And whats more she has got the upper hand of him
herself She has him beat

How beat

She has downed him with her eye Just by endurin him peacefully and
with her eye Ive saw it Things changed some after yu pulled out We
had a good crowd still and it was pleasant and not too lively nor yet
too slow And Willomene she come more among us Shed not stay shut
indoors like she done at first Id have like tove showed her how to
punish Hank

Afteh she had downed yu with her eye inquired the Virginian

Young McLean reddened and threw a furtive look upon me the stranger
the outsider Oh well he said I done nothing onusual But thats
all different now All of us likes her and respects her and makes
allowances for her bein Dutch Yu cant help but respect her And she
shows she knows

I reckon maybe she knows how to deal with Hank said the Virginian

Shucks said McLean scornfully And her so big and him so puny Shed
ought to lift him off the earth with one arm and lam him with a baste or
two with the other and hed improve

Maybe thats why she dont mused the Virginian slowly because
she is so big Big in the spirit I mean Shed not stoop to his
level Dont yu see she is kind o way up above him and camp and
everythingjust her and her crucifix

Her and her crucifix repeated young Lin McLean staring at this
interpretation which was beyond his lively understanding Her and her
crucifix Turruble lonesome company Well them are things yu dont
know about I kind o laughed myself the first time I seen her at it
Hank he says to me soft Come here Lin and I peeped in where she
was aprayin She seen us two but she didnt quit So I quit and Hank
came with me sayin tough words about it Yes them are things yu
sure dont know about Whats the matter with you camping with us boys
tonight

We had been going to visit them the next day We made it today
instead And Mr McLean helped us with our packs and we carried our
welcome in the shape of elk meat So we turned our faces down the
grasstopped mountains towards Galena Creek Once far through an
open gap away below us we sighted the cabin with the help of our
fieldglasses

Pity we cant make out Hank sleepin in that brush said McLean

He has probably gone into the cabin by now said I

Not him He prefers the brush all day when hes that drunk you bet

Afraid of her

Welloneasy in her presence Not that shes liable to be in there
now She dont stay inside nowadays so much Shes been comin round
the ditch silentlike but friendly And shell watch us workin for a
spell and then shes apt to move off alone into the woods singin them
Dutch songs of hern that aint got no toon Ive met her walkin that
way tall and earnest lots of times But she dont want your company
though shell patch your overalls and give yu lunch always Nor she
wont take pay

Thus we proceeded down from the open summits into the close pines
and while we made our way among the crosstimber and over the little
streams McLean told us of various days and nights at the camp and how
Hank had come to venting his cowardice upon his wifes faith

Why he informed her one day when he was goin take his dust to town
that if he come back and found that thing in the house hed do it up
for her So yu better pack off your wooden dummy somewheres says he
And she just looked at him kind o stonelike and solemn For she dont
care for his words no more

And while he was away shed have us all in to supper up at the shack
and look at us eatin while shed walk around puttin grub on your
plate Day time shed come around the ditch watchin for a while and
move off slow singin her Dutch songs And when Hank comes back from
spendin his dust he sees the crucifix same as always and he says
Didnt I tell yu to take that down You did says Willomene
lookin at him very quiet And he quit

And Honey Wiggin says to him Hank leave her alone And Hank bein
all trembly from spreein in town he says Youre all agin me like
as if he were a baby

I should think you would run him out of camp said I

Well weve studied over that some McLean answered But whats to be
done with Willomene

I did not know None of us seemed to know

The boys got together night before last continued McLean and after
holdin a unanimous meetin we visited her and spoke to her about goin
back to her home She was slow in corrallin our idea on account of her
bein no English scholar But when she did after three of us takin
their turn at puttin the proposition to her she would not accept
any of our dust And though she started to thank us the handsomest she
knowed how it seemed to grieve her for she cried So we thought wed
better get out Shes tried to tell us the name of her home but yu
cant pronounce such outlandishness

As we went down the mountains we talked of other things but always
came back to this and we were turning it over still when the sun had
departed from the narrow cleft that we were following and shone only
on the distant grassy tops which rose round us into an upper world of
light

Well all soon have to move out of this camp anyway said McLean
unstrapping his coat from his saddle and drawing it on It gets chill
now in the afternoons D yu see the quakinasps all turned yello
and the leaves keeps fallin without no wind to blow em down Were
liable to get snowed in on short notice in this mountain country If the
water goes to freeze on us well have to quit workin Theres camp

We had rounded a corner and once more sighted the cabin I suppose it
may have been still half a mile away upon the further side of a ravine
into which our little valley opened But fieldglasses were not needed
now to make out the cabin clearly windows and door Smoke rose from it
for suppertime was nearing and we stopped to survey the scene As we
were looking another hunter joined us coming from the deep woods to
the edge of the pines where we were standing This was Honey Wiggin He
had killed a deer and he surmised that all the boys would be back soon
Others had met luck besides himself he had left one dressing an elk
over the next ridge Nobody seemed to have got in yet from appearances
Didnt the camp look lonesome

Theres somebody though said McLean

The Virginian took the glasses I reckonyes thats Hank The cold
has woke him up and hes comin in out o the brush

Each of us took the glasses in turn and I watched the figure go up the
hill to the door of the cabin It seemed to pause and diverge to the
window At the window it stood still head bent looking in Then it
returned quickly to the door It was too far to discern even through
the glasses what the figure was doing Whether the door was locked
whether he was knocking or fumbling with a key or whether he spoke
through the door to the person withinI cannot tell what it was that
came through the glasses straight to my nerves so that I jumped at a
sudden sound and it was only the distant shrill call of an elk I was
handing the glasses to the Virginian for him to see when the figure
opened the door and disappeared in the dark interior As I watched the
square of darkness which the doors opening made something seemed to
happen thereor else it was a spark a flash in my own straining eyes

But at that same instant the Virginian dashed forward upon his horse
leaving the glasses in my hand And with the contagion of his act the
rest of us followed him leaving the pack animals to follow us as they
should choose

Look cried McLean Hes not shot her

I saw the tall figure of a woman rush out of the door and pass quickly
round the house

Hes missed her cried McLean again Shes savin herself

But the mans figure did not appear in pursuit Instead of this
the woman returned as quickly as she had gone and entered the dark
interior

She had something said Wiggin What would that be

Maybe its all right after all said McLean She went out to get
wood

The rough steepness of our trail had brought us down to a walk and
as we continued to press forward at this pace as fast as we could we
compared a few notes McLean did not think he saw any flash Wiggin
thought that he had heard a sound but it was at the moment when the
Virginians horse had noisily started away

Our trail had now taken us down where we could no longer look across and
see the cabin And the halfmile proved a long one over this ground At
length we reached and crossed the rocky ford overtaking the Virginian
there

These hawsses said he are played out Well climb up to camp afoot
And just keep behind me for the present

We obeyed our natural leader and made ready for whatever we might be
going into We passed up the steep bank and came again in sight of the
door It was still wide open We stood and felt a sort of silence which
the approach of two newcomers could not break They joined us They
had been coming home from hunting and had plainly heard a shot here
We stood for a moment more after learning this and then one of the
men called out the names of Hank and Willomene Again weor I at
leastfelt that same silence which to my disturbed imagination seemed
to be rising round us as mists rise from water

Theres nobody in there stated the Virginian Nobody thats alive
he added And he crossed the cabin and walked into the door

Though he made no gesture I saw astonishment pass through his body as
he stopped still and all of us came after him There hung the crucifix
with a round hole through the middle of it One of the men went to it
and took it down and behind it sunk in the log was the bullet The
cabin was but a single room and every object that it contained could be
seen at a glance nor was there hidingroom for anything On the floor
lay the axe from the woodpile but I will not tell of its appearance
So he had shot her crucifix her Rock of Ages the thing which enabled
her to bear her life and that lifted her above life and shebut there
was the axe to show what she had done then Was this cabin really empty
I looked more slowly about half dreading to find that I had overlooked
something But it was as the Virginian had said nobody was there

As we were wondering there was a noise above our heads and I was not
the only one who started and stared It was the parrot and we stood
away in a circle looking up at his cage Crouching flat on the floor of
the cage his wings huddled tight to his body he was swinging his head
from side to side and when he saw that we watched him he began a low
croaking and monotonous utterance which never changed but remained
rapid and continuous I heard McLean whisper to the Virginian You bet
he knows

The Virginian stepped to the door and then he bent to the gravel
and beckoned us to come and see Among the recent footprints at the
threshold the mans bootheel was plain as well as the womans broad
tread But while the mans steps led into the cabin they did not lead
away from it We tracked his course just as we had seen it through the
glasses up the hill from the brush to the window and then to the door
But he had never walked out again Yet in the cabin he was not we tore
up the halffloor that it had There was no use to dig in the earth And
all the while that we were at this search the parrot remained crouched
in the bottom of his cage his black eye fixed upon our movements

She has carried him said the Virginian We must follow up
Willomene

The latest heavy set of footprints led us from the door along the ditch
where they sank deep in the softer soil then they turned off sharply
into the mountains

This is the cutoff trail said McLean to me The same he brought her
in by

The tracks were very clear and evidently had been made by a person
moving slowly Whatever theories our various minds were now shaping no
one spoke a word to his neighbor but we went along with a hush over us

After some walking Wiggin suddenly stopped and pointed

We had come to the edge of the timber where a narrow black canyon
began and ahead of us the trail drew near a slanting ledge where the
footing was of small loose stones I recognized the odor the volcanic
whiff that so often prowls and meets one in the lonely woods of that
region but at first I failed to make out what had set us all running

Is he looking down into the hole himself some one asked and then
I did see a figure the figure I had looked at through the glasses
leaning strangely over the edge of Pitchstone Canyon as if indeed he
was peering to watch what might be in the bottom

We came near But those eyes were sightless and in the skull the story
of the axe was carved By a piece of his clothing he was hooked in the
twisted roots of a dead tree and hung there at the extreme verge I
went to look over and Lin McLean caught me as I staggered at the sight
I saw He would have lost his own foothold in saving me had not one of
the others held him from above

She was there below Hanks woman brought from Austria to the New
World The vision of that brown bundle lying in the water will never
leave me I think She had carried the body to this point but had she
intended this end Or was some part of it an accident Had she meant to
take him with her Had she meant to stay behind herself No word came
from these dead to answer us But as we stood speaking there a giant
puff of breath rose up to us between the black walls

Theres that fluffy sigh I told yu about said the Virginian

Hes talkin to her I tell yu hes talkin to her burst out McLean
suddenly in such a voice that we stared as he pointed at the man in the
tree See him lean over Hes sayin I have yu beat after all And
McLean fell to whimpering

Wiggin took the boys arm kindly and walked him along the trail He did
not seem twenty yet Life had not shown this side of itself to him so
plainly before

Lets get out of here said the Virginian

It seemed one more pitiful straw that the lonely bundle should be
left in such a vault of doom with no last touches of care from its
fellowbeings and no heap of kind earth to hide it But whether the
place is deadly or not man dares not venture into it So they took Hank
from the tree that night and early next morning they buried him near
camp on the top of a little mound

But the thought of Willomene lying in Pitchstone Canyon had kept sleep
from me through that whole night nor did I wish to attend Hanks
burial I rose very early while the sunshine had still a long way to
come down to us from the mountaintops and I walked back along the
cutoff trail I was moved to look once more upon that frightful place
And as I came to the edge of the timber there was the Virginian He did
not expect any one He had set up the crucifix as near the dead tree as
it could be firmly planted

It belongs to her anyway he explained

Some lines of verse came into my memory and with a change or two I
wrote them as deep as I could with my pencil upon a small board that he
smoothed for me

Call for the robin redbreast and the wren Since oer shady groves they
hover And with flowers and leaves do cover The friendless bodies of
unburied men Call to this funeral dole The ant the fieldmouse and
the mole To rear her hillocks that shall keep her warm

That kind o quaint language reminds me of a play I seen onced in Saynt
Paul said the Virginian About young Prince Henry

I told him that another poet was the author

They are both good writers said the Virginian And as he was
finishing the monument that we had made young Lin McLean joined us
He was a little ashamed of the feelings that he had shown yesterday a
little anxious to cover those feelings with brass

Well he said taking an offish manoftheworld tone all this fuss
just because a woman believed in God

You have put it down wrong said the Virginian its just because a
man didnt




Padre Ignazio


At Santa Ysabel del Mar the season was at one of its moments when the
air hangs quiet over land and sea The old breezes had gone the new
ones were not yet risen The flowers in the mission garden opened wide
for no wind came by day or night to shake the loose petals from their
stems Along the basking silent manycolored shore gathered and
lingered the crisp odors of the mountains The dust floated golden and
motionless long after the rider was behind the hill and the Pacific lay
like a floor of sapphire on which to walk beyond the setting sun into
the East One white sail shone there Instead of an hour it had been
from dawn till afternoon in sight between the short headlands and the
padre had hoped that it might be his ship But it had slowly passed
Now from an arch in his garden cloisters he was watching the last of it
Presently it was gone and the great ocean lay empty The padre put his
glasses in his lap For a short while he read in his breviary but soon
forgot it again He looked at the flowers and sunny ridges then at
the huge blue triangle of sea which the opening of the hills let into
sight Paradise he murmured need not hold more beauty and peace But
I think I would exchange all my remaining years of this for one sight
again of Paris or Seville May God forgive me such a thought

Across the unstirred fragrance of oleanders the bell for vespers began
to ring Its tones passed over the padre as he watched the sea in his
garden They reached his parishioners in their adobe dwellings near
by The gentle circles of sound floated outward upon the smooth immense
silenceover the vines and peartrees down the avenues of the olives
into the planted fields whence women and children began to return then
out of the lap of the valley along the yellow uplands where the men
that rode among the cattle paused looking down like birds at the map
of their home Then the sound widened faint unbroken until it met
Temptation riding towards the padre from the south and cheered the
steps of Temptations jaded horse

For a day one single day of Paris repeated the padre gazing through
his cloisters at the empty sea

Once in the year the motherworld remembered him Once in the year a
barkentine came sailing with news and tokens from Spain It was in
1685 that a galleon had begun such voyages up to the lower country from
Acapulco where she loaded the cargo that had come across Tehuantepec on
mules from Vera Cruz By 1768 she had added the new mission of San Diego
to her ports In the year that we a thin strip of colonists away over
on the Atlantic edge of the continent declared ourselves an independent
nation that Spanish ship in the name of Saint Francis was unloading
the centuries of her own civilization at the Golden Gate Then slowly
as mission after mission was planted along the soft coast wilderness
she made new stopsat Santa Barbara for instance and by Point San
Luis for San Luis Obispo that lay inland a little way up the gorge
where it opened among the hills Thus the world reached these places
by water while on land through the mountains a road came to lead to
them and also to many more that were too distant behind the hills
for ships to servea long lonely rough road punctuated with church
towers and gardens For the fathers gradually so stationed their
settlements that the traveller might each morning ride out from one
mission and by evening of a days fair journey ride into the next A
long rough road and in its way pretty to think of now

So there byandby was our continent with the locomotive whistling
from Savannah to Boston along its eastern edge and on the other the
scattered chimes of Spain ringing among the unpeopled mountains Thus
grew the two sorts of civilizationnot equally We know what has
happened since Today the locomotive is whistling also from the Golden
Gate to San Diego but the old mission road goes through the mountains
still and on it the steps of vanished Spain are marked with roses and
white cloisters and the crucifix

But this was 1855 Only the barkentine brought the world that he loved
to the padre As for the new world which was making a rude noise to the
northward he trusted that it might keep away from Santa Ysabel and he
waited for the vessel that was overdue with its package containing his
single worldly indulgence

As the little ancient bronze bell continued its swinging in the tower
its plaintive call reached something in the padres memory Without
knowing he began to sing He took up the slow strain not quite
correctly and dropped it and took it up again always in cadence with
the bell

Musical Score Appears Here

At length he heard himself and glancing at the belfry smiled a little
It is a pretty tune he said and it always made me sorry for poor
Fra Diavolo Auber himself confessed to me that he had made it sad
and put the hermitage bell to go with it because he too was grieved at
having to kill his villain and wanted him to die if possible in a
religious frame of mind And Auber touched glasses with me and saidhow
well I remember itIs it the good Lord or is it merely the devil
that makes me always have a weakness for rascals I told him it was the
devil I was not a priest then I could not be so sure with my answer
now And then Padre Ignazio repeated Aubers remark in French Estce
le bon Dieu on estce bien le diable qui me fait tonjours aimer les
coquins I dont know I dont know I wonder if Auber has composed
anything lately I wonder who is singing Zerlina now

He cast a farewell look at the ocean and took his steps between the
monastic herbs and the oleanders to the sacristy At least he said
if we cannot carry with us into exile the friends and the places that
we have loved music will go where we go even to such an end of the
world as this Felipe he called to his organist Can they sing the
music I taught them for the Dixit Dominus tonight

Yes father surely

Then we will have that And Felipe The padre crossed the chancel to
the small shabby organ Rise my child and listen Here is something
you can learn Why see now if you cannot learn it with a single
hearing

The swarthy boy of sixteen stood watching his masters fingers delicate
and white as they played So of his own accord he had begun to watch
them when a child of six and the padre had taken the wild halfscared
spellbound creature and made a musician of him

There Felipe he said now Can you do it Slower and more softly
muchacho It is about the death of a man and it should go with our
bell

The boy listened Then the father has played it a tone too low said
he for our bell rings the note of sol or something very near it as
the father must surely know He placed the melody in the right keyan
easy thing for him but the padre was delighted

Ah my Felipe he exclaimed what could you and I not do if we had a
better organ Only a little better See above this row of keys would be
a second row and many more stops Then we would make such music as has
never been heard in California yet But my people are so poor and so
few And some day I shall have passed from them and it will be too
late

Perhaps ventured Felipe the Americanos

They care nothing for us Felipe They are not of our religionor of
any religion from what I can hear Dont forget my Dixit Dominus
And the padre retired once more to the sacristy while the horse that
carried Temptation came over the hill

The hour of service drew near and as he waited the padre once again
stepped out for a look at the ocean but the blue triangle of water lay
like a picture in its frame of land empty as the sky I think from
the color though said he that a little more wind must have begun
out there

The bell rang a last short summons to prayer Along the road from the
south a young rider leading one packanimal ambled into the mission
and dismounted Church was not so much in his thoughts as food and in
due time after that a bed but the doors stood open and as everybody
was going into them more variety was to be gained by joining this
company than by waiting outside alone until they should return from
their devotions So he seated himself at the back and after a brief
jaunty glance at the sunburnt shaggy congregation made himself as
comfortable as might be He had not seen a face worth keeping his eyes
open for The simple choir and simple fold gathered for evensong and
paid him no attention on their parta rough American bound for the
mines was no longer anything but an object of aversion to them

The padre of course had been instantly aware of the strangers
presence For this is the sixth sense with vicars of every creed and
heresy and if the parish is lonely and the worshippers few and seldom
varying a newcomer will gleam out like a new book to be read And a
trained priest learns to read shrewdly the faces of those who assemble
to worship under his guidance But American vagrants with no thoughts
save of golddigging and an overweening illiterate jargon for their
speech had long ceased to interest this priest even in his starvation
for company and talk from the outside world and therefore after the
intoning he sat with his homesick thoughts unchanged to draw both pain
and enjoyment from the music that he had set to the Dixit Dominus He
listened to the tender chorus that opens William Tell and as the
Latin psalm proceeded pictures of the past rose between him and the
altar One after another came these strains which he had taken from the
operas famous in their day until at length the padre was murmuring to
some music seldom long out of his heartnot the Latin verse which the
choir sang but the original French words

 Ah voile man envie
 Voila mon seul desir
 Rendez moi ma patrie
 Ou laissez moi mourir


Which may be rendered

 But one wish I implore
 One wish is all my cry
 Give back my native land once more
 Give back or let me die

Then it happened that he saw the stranger in the back of the church
again and forgot his Dixit Dominus straightway The face of the young
man was no longer hidden by the slouching position he had at first
taken I only noticed his clothes before thought the padre
Restlessness was plain upon the handsome brow and in the mouth there
was violence but Padre Ignazio liked the eyes He is not saying any
prayers he surmised presently I doubt if he has said any for a long
while And he knows my music He is of educated people He cannot be
American And nowyes he has takenI think it must be a flower from
his pocket I shall have him to dine with me And vespers ended with
rosy clouds of eagerness drifting across the padres brain

But the stranger made his own beginning As the priest came from the
church the rebellious young figure was waiting Your organist tells
me he said impetuously that it is you who

May I ask with whom I have the great pleasure of speaking said the
padre putting formality to the front and his pleasure out of sight

The stranger reddened and became aware of the padres features moulded
by refinement and the world I beg your lenience said he with a
graceful and confident utterance as of equal to equal My name is
Gaston Villere and it was time I should be reminded of my manners

The padres hand waved a polite negative

Indeed yes padre But your music has astonished me to pieces If you
carried such associations asAh the days and the nights he broke
off To come down a California mountain he resumed and find Paris
at the bottom The Huguenots Rossini HeroldI was waiting for Il
Trovatore

Is that something new said the padre eagerly

The young man gave an exclamation The whole world is ringing with it
he said

But Santa Ysabel del Mar is a long way from the whole world said
Padre Ignazio

Indeed it would not appear to be so returned young Gaston I think
the Comedie Francaise must be round the corner

A thrill went through the priest at the theatres name And have you
been long in America he asked

Why alwaysexcept two years of foreign travel after college

An American said the surprised padre with perhaps a flavor of
disappointment in his voice But no Americans who have yet come this
way have beenhave beenhe veiled the too blunt expression of his
thoughthave been familiar with The Huguenots he finished making
a slight bow

Villere took his undermeaning I come from New Orleans he returned
And in New Orleans there live many of us who can recognize awho can
recognize good music wherever we meet it And he made a slight bow in
his turn

The padre laughed outright with pleasure and laid his hand upon the
young mans arm You have no intention of going away tomorrow I
trust said he

With your leave answered Gaston I will have such an intention no
longer

It was with the air and gait of mutual understanding that the two now
walked on together towards the padres door The guest was twentyfive
the host sixty

And have you been in America long inquired Gaston

Twenty years

And at Santa Ysabel how long

Twenty years

I should have thought said Gaston looking lightly at the empty
mountains that now and again you might have wished to travel

Were I your age murmured Padre Ignazio it might be so

The evening had now ripened to the long afterglow of sunset The sea
was the purple of grapes and wine colored hues flowed among the high
shoulders of the mountains

I have seen a sight like this said Gaston between Granada and
Malaga

So you know Spain said the padre

Often he had thought of this resemblance but never heard it told to
him before The courtly proprietor of San Fernando and the other
patriarchal rancheros with whom he occasionally exchanged visits across
the wilderness knew hospitality and inherited gentle manners sending
to Europe for silks and laces to give their daughters but their eyes
had not looked upon Granada and their ears had never listened to
William Tell

It is quite singular pursued Gaston how one nook in the world will
suddenly remind you of another nook that may be thousands of miles away
One morning behind the Quai Voltaire an old yellow house with rusty
balconies made me almost homesick for New Orleans

The Quai Voltaire said the padre

I heard Rachel in Valerie that night the young man went on
Did you know that she could sing too She sang several verses by an
astonishing little Jew musician that has come up over there

The padre gazed down at his blithe guest To see somebody somebody
once again he said is very pleasant to a hermit

It cannot be more pleasant than arriving at an oasis returned Gaston

They had delayed on the threshold to look at the beauty of the evening
and now the priest watched his parishioners come and go How can one
make companions he began then checking himself he said Their
souls are as sacred and immortal as mine and God helps me to help
them But in this world it is not immortal souls that we choose for
companions it is kindred tastes intelligences andand so I and my
books are growing old together you see he added more lightly You
will find my volumes as behind the times as myself

He had fallen into talk more intimate than he wished and while the
guest was uttering something polite about the nobility of missionary
work he placed him in an easychair and sought aguardiente for his
immediate refreshment Since the years beginning there had been no
guest for him to bring into his rooms or to sit beside him in the high
seats at table set apart for the gente fina

Such another library was not then in California and though Gaston
Villere in leaving Harvard College had shut Horace and Sophocles
forever at the earliest instant possible under academic requirements he
knew the Greek and Latin names that he now saw as well as he knew those
of Shakespeare Dante Moliere and Cervantes These were here also nor
could it be precisely said of them either that they made a part of the
young mans daily reading As he surveyed the padres august shelves
it was with a touch of the florid Southern gravity which his Northern
education had not wholly schooled out of him that he said

I fear that I am no scholar sir But I know what writers every
gentleman ought to respect

The subtle padre bowed gravely to this compliment

It was when his eyes caught sight of the music that the young man felt
again at ease and his vivacity returned to him Leaving his chair he
began enthusiastically to examine the tall piles that filled one side of
the room The volumes lay richly everywhere making a pleasant
disorder and as perfume comes out of a flower memories of singers and
chandeliers rose bright from the printed names Norma Tancredi
Don Pasquale La Vestaledim lights in the fashions of
todaysparkled upon the exploring Gaston conjuring the radiant
halls of Europe before him The Barber of Seville he presently
exclaimed And I happened to hear it in Seville

But Sevilles name brought over the padre a new rush of home thoughts
Is not Andalusia beautiful he said Did you see it in April when
the flowers come

Yes said Gaston among the music I was at Cordova then

Ah Cordova murmured the padre

Semiramide cried Gaston lighting upon that opera That was a
week I should like to live it over every day and night of it

Did you reach Malaga from Marseilles or Gibraltar said the padre
wistfully

From Marseilles Down from Paris through the Rhone Valley you know

Then you saw Provence And did you go perhaps from Avignon to Nismes
by the Pont du Gard There is a place I have made herea little little
placewith olivetrees And now they have grown and it looks something
like that country if you stand in a particular position I will take
you there tomorrow I think you will understand what I mean

Another resemblance said the volatile and happy Gaston We both seem
to have an eye for them But believe me padre I could never stay here
planting olives I should go back and see the original onesand then
Id hasten up to Paris And with a volume of Meyerbeer open in his
hand Gaston hummed Robert Robert toi que jaime Why padre
I think that your library contains none of the masses and all of the
operas in the world

I will make you a little confession said Padre Ignazio and then you
shall give me a little absolution

With a penance said Gaston You must play over some of these things
to me

I suppose that I could not permit myself this indulgence began the
padre pointing to his operas and teach these to my choir if the
people had any worldly associations with the music But I have reasoned
that the music cannot do them harm

The ringing of a bell here interrupted him In fifteen minutes he
said our poor meal will be ready for you The good padre was
not quite sincere when he spoke of a poor meal While getting the
aguardiente for his guest he had given orders and he knew how well such
orders could be carried out He lived alone and generally supped simply
enough but not even the ample table at San Fernando could surpass his
own on occasions And this was for him an occasion indeed

Your halfbreeds will think I am one of themselves said Gaston
showing his dusty clothes I am not fit to be seated with you He
too was not more sincere than his host In his pack which an Indian
had brought from his horse he carried some garments of civilization
And presently after fresh water and not a little painstaking with brush
and scarf there came back to the padre a young guest whose elegance and
bearing and ease of the great world were to the exiled priest as sweet
as was his traveled conversation

They repaired to the hall and took their seats at the head of the long
table For the stately Spanish centuries of custom lived at Santa Ysabel
del Mar inviolate feudal remote

They were the only persons of quality present and between themselves
and the gente de razon a space intervened Behind the padres chair
stood an Indian to wait upon him and another stood behind the chair of
Gaston Villere Each of these servants wore one single white garment
and offered the many dishes to the gente fina and refilled their
glasses At the lower end of the table a general attendant waited upon
the mescladosthe halfbreeds There was meat with spices and roasted
quail with various cakes and other preparations of grain also the
black fresh olives and grapes with several sorts of figs and plums
and preserved fruits and white and red winethe white fifty years
old Beneath the quiet shining of candles freshcut flowers leaned from
vessels of old Mexican and Spanish make

There at one end of this feast sat the wild pastoral gaudy company
speaking little over their food and there at the other the pale padre
questioning his visitor about Rachel The mere name of a street would
bring memories crowding to his lips and when his guest would tell him
of a new play he was ready with old quotations from the same author
Alfred de Vigny they had and Victor Hugo whom the padre disliked Long
after the dulce or sweet dish when it was the custom for the vaqueros
and the rest of the retainers to rise and leave the gente fina to
themselves the host sat on in the empty hall fondly telling the guest
of his bygone Paris and fondly learning of the Paris that was today
And thus the two lingered exchanging their fervors while the candles
waned and the longhaired Indians stood silent behind the chairs

But we must go to my piano the host exclaimed For at length they had
come to a lusty difference of opinion The padre with ears critically
deaf and with smiling unconvinced eyes was shaking his head while
young Gaston sang Trovatore at him and beat upon the table with a
fork

Come and convert me then said Padre Ignazio and he led the way
Donizetti I have always admitted There at least is refinement
If the world has taken to this Verdi with his streetband musicBut
there now Sit down and convert me Only dont crush my poor little
Erard with Verdis hoofs I brought it when I came It is behind the
times too And oh my dear boy our organ is still worse So old so
old To get a proper one I would sacrifice even this piano of mine in a
momentonly the tinkling thing is not worth a sou to anybody except its
master But there Are you quite comfortable And having seen to his
guests needs and placed spirits and cigars and an ashtray within his
reach the padre sat himself luxuriously in his chair to hear and expose
the false doctrine of Il Trovatore

By midnight all of the opera that Gaston could recall had been played
and sung twice The convert sat in his chair no longer but stood
singing by the piano The potent swing and flow of tunes the torrid
copious inspiration of the South mastered him Verdi has grown he
cried Verdi has become a giant And he swayed to the beat of the
melodies and waved an enthusiastic arm He demanded every crumb Why
did not Gaston remember it all But if the barkentine would arrive and
bring the whole music then they would have it right And he made Gaston
teach him what words he knewNon ti scordar he sangnon ti
scordar di me That is genius But one sees how the world moves when
one is out of it A nostri monti ritorneremo home to our mountains
Ah yes there is genius again And the exile sighed and his spirit
went to distant places while Gaston continued brilliantly with the
music of the final scene

Then the host remembered his guest I am ashamed of my selfishness he
said It is already tomorrow

I have sat later in less good company answered the pleasant Gaston
And I shall sleep all the sounder for making a convert

You have dispensed roadside alms said the padre smiling And that
should win excellent dreams

Thus with courtesies more elaborate than the world has time for at the
present day they bade each other goodnight and parted bearing their
late candles along the quiet halls of the mission To young Gaston in
his bed easy sleep came without waiting and no dreams at all Outside
his open window was the quiet serene darkness where the stars shone
clear and tranquil perfumes hung in the cloisters And while the guest
lay sleeping all night in unchanged position like a child up and down
between the oleanders went Padre Ignazio walking until dawn

Day showed the oceans surface no longer glassy but lying like a mirror
breathed upon and there between the short headlands came a sail
gray and plain against the flat water The priest watched through his
glasses and saw the gradual sun grow strong upon the canvas of the
barkentine The message from his world was at hand yet today he
scarcely cared so much Sitting in his garden yesterday he could never
have imagined such a change But his heart did not hail the barkentine
as usual Books music pale paper and printthis was all that was
coming to him and some of its savor had gone for the siren voice of
life had been speaking with him face to face and in his spirit deep
down the love of the world was restlessly answering that call Young
Gaston showed more eagerness than the padre over this arrival of the
vessel that might be bringing Trovatore in the nick of time Now he
would have the chance before he took his leave to help rehearse the
new music with the choir He would be a missionary too A perfectly new
experience

And you still forgive Verdi the sins of his youth he said to his
host I wonder if you could forgive mine

Verdi has left his behind him retorted the padre

But I am only twentyfive explained Gaston pathetically

Ah dont go away soon pleaded the exile It was the plainest burst
that had escaped him and he felt instant shame

But Gaston was too much elated with the enjoyment of each new day to
understand The shafts of anothers pain might scarcely pierce the
bright armor of his gayety He mistook the priests exclamation for
anxiety about his own happy soul

Stay here under your care he said It would do me no good padre
Temptation sticks closer to me than a brother and he gave that laugh
of his which disarmed severer judges than his host By next week I
should have introduced some sin or other into your beautiful Garden of
Ignorance here It will be much safer for your flock if I go and join
the other serpents at San Francisco

Soon after breakfast the padre had his two mules saddled and he and his
guest set forth down the hills together to the shore And beneath the
spell and confidence of pleasant slow riding and the loveliness of
everything the young man talked freely of himself

And seriously said he if I missed nothing else at Santa Ysabel I
should long to hear the birds At home our gardens are full of them and
one smells the jasmine and they sing and sing When our ship from
the Isthmus put into San Diego I decided to go on by land and see
California Then after the first days I began to miss something All
that beauty seemed empty in a way And suddenly I found it was the
birds For these little scampering quail are nothing There seems a sort
of death in the air where no birds ever sing

You will not find any birds at San Francisco said the padre

I shall find life exclaimed Gaston And my fortune at the mines I
hope I am not a bad fellow father You can easily guess all the things
that I do I have never to my knowledge harmed any one I did not even
try to kill my adversary in an affair of honor I gave him a mere flesh
wound and by this time he must be quite recovered He was my friend
But as he came between me

Gaston stopped and the padre looking keenly at him saw the violence
that he had noticed in church pass like a flame over the young mans
handsome face

Theres nothing dishonorable said Gaston answering the priests
look

I have not thought so my son

I did what every gentleman would do said Gaston

And that is often wrong cried the padre But Im not your
confessor

Ive nothing to confess said Gaston frankly I left New Orleans at
once and have travelled an innocent journey straight to you And when I
make my fortune I shall be in a position to return and

Claim the pressed flower put in the padre laughing

Ah you remember how those things are said Gaston and he laughed
also and blushed

Yes said the padre looking at the anchored barkentine I remember
how those things are And for a while the vessel and its cargo and the
landed men and various business and conversations occupied them But the
freight for the mission once seen to there was not much else to hang
about here for

The barkentine was only a coaster like many others which now had begun
to fill the sea a little more of late years and presently host and
guest were riding homeward And guessing at the two men from their
outsides any one would have got them precisely wrong for within the
turbulent young figure of Gaston dwelt a spirit that could not be more
at ease while revolt was steadily smouldering beneath the schooled and
placid mask of the padre

Yet still the strangeness of his being at such a place came back as
a marvel into the young mans lively mind Twenty years in prison he
thought and hardly aware of it And he glanced at the silent priest
A man so evidently fond of music of theatres of the world to whom
pressed flowers had meant something onceand now contented to bleach
upon these wastes Not even desirous of a brief holiday but finding
an old organ and some old operas enough recreation It is his age I
suppose thought Gaston And then the notion of himself when he should
be sixty occurred to him and he spoke

Do you know I do not believe said he that I should ever reach such
contentment as yours

Perhaps you will said Padre Ignazio in a low voice

Never declared the youth It comes only to the few I am sure

Yes Only to the few murmured the padre

I am certain that it must be a great possession Gaston continued
and yetand yetdear me life is a splendid thing

There are several sorts of it said the padre

Only one for me cried Gaston Action men women thingsto be
there to be known to play a part to sit in the front seats to have
people tell each other There goes Gaston Villere and to deserve
ones prominence Why if I were Padre of Santa Ysabel del Mar for
twenty yearsno for one yeardo you know what I should have done
Some day it would have been too much for me I should have left these
savages to a pastor nearer their own level and I should have ridden
down this canyon upon my mule and stepped on board the barkentine and
gone back to my proper sphere You will understand sir that I am far
from venturing to make any personal comment I am only thinking what a
world of difference lies between mens natures who can feel alike as we
do upon so many subjects Why not since leaving New Orleans have I
met any one with whom I could talk except of the weather and the brute
interests common to us all That such a one as you should be here is
like a dream

But it is not a dream said the padre

And sirpardon me if I do say thisare you not wasted at Santa
Ysabel del Mar I have seen the priests at the other missions They
arethe sort of good men that I expected But are you needed to save
such souls as these

There is no aristocracy of souls said the padre almost whispering
now

But the body and the mind cried Gaston My God are they nothing Do
you think that they are given to us for nothing but a trap You cannot
teach such a doctrine with your library there And how about all
the cultivated men and women away from whose quickening society the
brightest of us grow numb You have held out But will it be for long
Do you not owe yourself to the saving of higher game henceforth Are not
twenty years of mesclados enough No no finished young Gaston hot
with his unforeseen eloquence I should ride down some morning and take
the barkentine

Padre Ignazio was silent for a space

I have not offended you said the young man

No Anything but that You are surprised that I shouldchooseto stay
here Perhaps you may have wondered how I came to be here at all

I had not intended any impertinent

Oh no Put such an idea out of your head my son You may remember that
I was going to make you a confession about my operas Let us sit down in
this shade

So they picketed the mules near the stream and sat down

You have seen began Padre Ignazio what sort of a man Iwas once
Indeed it seems very strange to myself that you should have been here
not twentyfour hours yet and know so much of me For there has come
no one else at allthe padre paused a moment and mastered the
unsteadiness that he had felt approaching in his voicethere has been
no one else to whom I have talked so freely In my early days I had
no thought of being a priest My parents destined me for a diplomatic
career There was plenty of money andand all the rest of it for by
inheritance came to me the acquaintance of many people whose names
you would be likely to have heard of Cities people of fashion
artiststhe whole of it was my element and my choice and byandby I
married not only where it was desirable but where I loved Then
for the first time Death laid his staff upon my enchantment and I
understood many things that had been only words to me hitherto Looking
back it seemed to me that I had never done anything except for myself
all my days I left the world In due time I became a priest and lived
in my own country But my worldly experience and my secular education
had given to my opinions a turn too liberal for the place where my work
was laid I was soon advised concerning this by those in authority over
me And since they could not change me and I could not change them
yet wished to work and to teach the New World was suggested and I
volunteered to give the rest of my life to missions It was soon found
that some one was needed here and for this little place I sailed and
to these humble people I have dedicated my service They are pastoral
creatures of the soil Their vineyard and cattle days are apt to be like
the sun and storm around themstrong alike in their evil and in
their good All their years they live as childrenchildren with mens
passions given to them like deadly weapons unable to measure the harm
their impulses may bring Hence even in their crimes their hearts will
generally open soon to the one great key of love while civilization
makes locks which that key cannot always fit at the first turn And
coming to know this said Padre Ignazio fixing his eyes steadily upon
Gaston you will understand how great a privilege it is to help such
people and hour the sense of something accomplishedunder Godshould
bring contentment with renunciation

Yes said Gaston Villere Then thinking of himself I can understand
it in a man like you

Do not speak of me at all exclaimed the padre almost passionately
But pray Heaven that you may find the thing yourself some day
contentment with renunciationand never let it go

Amen said Gaston strangely moved

That is the whole of my story the priest continued with no more
of the recent stress in his voice And now I have talked to you about
myself quite enough But you must have my confession He had now
resumed entirely his halfplayful tone I was just a little mistaken
you see too selfreliant perhapswhen I supposed in my first
missionary ardor that I could get on without any remembrance of the
world at all I found that I could not And so I have taught the old
operas to my choirsuch parts of them as are within our compass and
suitable for worship And certain of my friends still alive at home are
good enough to remember this taste of mine and to send me each year
some of the new music that I should never hear of otherwise Then we
study these things also And although our organ is a miserable affair
Felipe manages very cleverly to make it do And while the voices are
singing these operas especially the old ones what harm is there
if sometimes the priest is thinking of something else So theres my
confession And now whether Trovatore has come or not I shall
not allow you to leave us until you have taught all you know of it to
Felipe

The new opera however had duly arrived And as he turned its pages
Padre Ignazio was quick to seize at once upon the music that could be
taken into his church Some of it was ready fitted By that afternoon
Felipe and his choir could have rendered Ah se lerror t ingombra
without slip or falter

Those were strange rehearsals of Il Trovatore upon this California
shore For the padre looked to Gaston to say when they went too fast
or too slow and to correct their emphasis And since it was hot the
little Erard piano was carried each day out into the mission garden
There in the cloisters among the oleanders in the presence of the tall
yellow hills and the blue triangle of sea the Miserere was slowly
learned The Mexicans and Indians gathered swarthy and blackhaired
around the tinkling instrument that Felipe played and presiding over
them were young Gaston and the pale padre walking up and down the
paths beating time or singing now one part and now another And so it
was that the wild cattle on the uplands would hear Trovatore hummed by
a passing vaquero while the same melody was filling the streets of the
faroff world

For three days Gaston Villere remained at Santa Ysabel del Mar and
though not a word of the sort came from him his host could read San
Francisco and the goldmines in his countenance No the young man could
not have stayed here for twenty years And the padre forbore urging his
guest to extend his visit

But the world is small the guest declared at parting Some day it
will not be able to spare you any longer And then we are sure to meet
And you shall hear from me soon at any rate

Again as upon the first evening the two exchanged a few courtesies
more graceful and particular than we who have not time and fight no
duels find worth a mans while at the present day For duels are gone
which is a very good thing and with them a certain careful politeness
which is a pity but that is the way in the general profit and loss So
young Gaston rode northward out of the mission back to the world and
his fortune and the padre stood watching the dust after the rider had
passed from sight Then he went into his room with a drawn face But
appearances at least had been kept up to the end the youth would never
know of the old mans discontent

Temptation had arrived with Gaston but was going to make a longer stay
at Santa Ysabel del Mar Yet it was something like a week before the
priest knew what guest he had in his house now The guest was not always
presentmade himself scarce quite often

Sail away on the barkentine That was a wild notion to be sure
although fit enough to enter the brain of such a young scapegrace The
padre shook his head and smiled affectionately when he thought of Gaston
Villere The youths handsome reckless countenance would come before
him and he repeated Aubers old remark Is it the good Lord or is it
merely the devil that always makes me have a weakness for rascals

Sail away on the barkentine Imagine taking leave of the people hereof
Felipe In what words should he tell the boy to go on industriously with
his music No this could not be imagined The mere parting alone would
make it forever impossible that he should think of such a thing And
then he said to himself each new morning when he looked out at the
ocean I have given my life to them One does not take back a gift

Pictures of his departure began to shine and melt in his drifting fancy
He saw himself explaining to Felipe that now his presence was wanted
elsewhere that there would come a successor to take care of Santa
Ysabela younger man more useful and able to visit sick people at a
distance For I am old now I should not be long here in any case He
stopped and pressed his hands together he had caught his temptation in
the very act Now he sat staring at his temptations face close to him
while there in the triangle two ships went sailing by

One morning Felipe told him that the barkentine was here on its return
voyage south Indeed said the padre coldly The things are ready to
go I think For the vessel called for mail and certain boxes that
the mission sent away Felipe left the room in wonder at the padres
manner But the priest was laughing alone inside to see how little it
was to him where the barkentine was or whether it should be coming
or going But in the afternoon at his piano he found himself saying
Other ships call here at any rate And then for the first time he
prayed to be delivered from his thoughts Yet presently he left his seat
and looked out of the window for a sight of the barkentine but it was
gone

The season of the winemaking passed and the putting up of all
the fruits that the mission fields grew Lotions and medicines were
distilled from the garden herbs Perfume was manufactured from the
petals of the flowers and certain spices and presents of it despatched
to San Fernando and Ventura and to friends at other places for the
padre had a special receipt As the time ran on two or three visitors
passed a night with him and presently there was a word at various
missions that Padre Ignazio had begun to show his years At Santa Ysabel
del Mar they whispered The padre is getting sick Yet he rode a great
deal over the hills by himself and down the canyon very often stopping
where he had sat with Gaston to sit alone and look up and down now at
the hills above and now at the ocean below Among his parishioners
he had certain troubles to soothe certain wounds to heal a home from
which he was able to drive jealousy a girl whom he bade her lover set
right But all said The padre is sick And Felipe told them that
the music seemed nothing to him any more he never asked for his Dixit
Dominus nowadays Then for a short time he was really in bed feverish
with the two voices that spoke to him without ceasing You have given
your life said one voice And therefore said the other have
earned the right to go home and die You are winning better rewards in
the service of God said the first voice God can be served in other
places than this answered the second As he lay listening he saw
Seville again and the trees of Aranhal where he had been born The
wind was blowing through them and in their branches he could hear the
nightingales Empty Empty he said aloud He was right about the
birds Death does live in the air where they never sing And he lay for
two days and nights hearing the wind and the nightingales in the trees
of Aranhal But Felipe watching heard only the padre crying through
the hours Empty Empty

Then the wind in the trees died down and the padre could get out of
bed and soon could be in the garden But the voices within him still
talked all the while as he sat watching the sails when they passed
between the headlands Their words falling forever the same way beat
his spirit sore like bruised flesh If he could only change what they
said he could rest

Has the padre any mail for Santa Barbara said Felipe The ship bound
southward should be here tomorrow

I will attend to it said the priest not moving And Felipe stole
away

At Felipes words the voices had stopped a clock done striking
Silence strained like expectation filled the padres soul But in
place of the voices came old sights of home again the waving trees at
Aranhal then would be Rachel for a moment declaiming tragedy while a
houseful of faces that he knew by name watched her and through all the
panorama rang the pleasant laugh of Gaston For a while in the evening
the padre sat at his Erard playing Trovatore Later in his sleepless
bed he lay saying now a then To die at home Surely I may granted
at least this And he listened for the inner voices But they were not
speaking any more and the black hole of silence grew more dreadful to
him than their arguments Then the dawn came in at his window and he
lay watching its gray grow warm into color us suddenly he sprang from
his bed and looked the sea The southbound ship was coming People were
on board who in a few weeks would be sailing the Atlantic while he
would stand here looking out of the same window Merciful God he
cried sinking on knees Heavenly Father Thou seest this evil in my
heart Thou knowest that my weak hand cannot pluck it out My strength
is breaking and still Thou makest my burden heavier than I can bear
He stopped breathless and trembling The same visions were flitting
across his closed eyes the same silence gaped like a dry crater in his
soul There is no help in earth or heaven he said very quietly and
he dressed himself

It was so early still that none but a few of the Indians were stirring
and one of them saddled the padres mule Felipe was not yet awake and
for a moment it came in the priests mind to open the boys door softly
look at him once more and come away But this he did not do nor
even take a farewell glance at the church and organ He bade nothing
farewell but turning his back upon his room and his garden rode down
the caution

The vessel lay at anchor and some one had landed from her and was
talking with other men on the shore Seeing the priest slowly coming
this stranger approached to meet him

You are connected with the mission here he inquired

Iam

Perhaps it is with you that Gaston Villere stopped

The young man from New Orleans Yes I am Padre Ignazio

Then you will save me a journey I promised him to deliver these into
your own hands

The stranger gave them to him

A bag of golddust he explained and a letter I wrote it from his
dictation while he was dying He lived scarcely an hour afterwards

The stranger bowed his head at the stricken cry which his news elicited
from the priest who after a few moments vain effort to speak opened
the letter and read

MY DEAR FRIENDIt is through no mans fault but mine that I have come
to this I have had plenty of luck and lately have been counting the
days until I should return home But last night heavy news from New
Orleans reached me and I tore the pressed flower to pieces Under the
first smart and humiliation of broken faith I was rendered desperate
and picked a needless quarrel Thank God it is I who have the
punishment My dear friend as I lie here leaving a world that no man
ever loved more I have come to understand you For you and your mission
have been much in my thoughts It is strange how good can be done not
at the time when it is intended but afterwards and you have done this
good to me I say over your words Contentment with renunciation and
believe that at this last hour I have gained something like what you
would wish me to feel For I do not think that I desire it otherwise
now My life would never have been of service I am afraid You are the
last person in this world who has spoken serious words to me and I want
you to know that now at length I value the peace of Santa Ysabel as I
could never have done but for seeing your wisdom and goodness You spoke
of a new organ for your church Take the golddust that will reach you
with this and do what you will with it Let me at least in dying have
helped some one And since there is no aristocracy in soulsyou said
that to me do you rememberperhaps you will say a mass for this
departing soul of mine I only wish since my body must go underground
in a strange country that it might have been at Santa Ysabel del Mar
where your feet would often pass

At Santa Ysabel del Mar where your feet would often pass The
priest repeated this final sentence aloud without being aware of it

Those are the last words he ever spoke said the stranger except
bidding goodbye to me

You knew him well then

No not until after he was hurt Im the man he quarrelled with

The priest looked at the ship that would sail onward this afternoon
Then a smile of great beauty passed over his face and he addressed the
stranger I thank you said he You will never know what you have
done for me

It is nothing answered the stranger awkwardly He told me you set
great store on a new organ

Padre Ignazio turned away from the ship and rode back through the
gorge When he reached the shady place where once he had sat with Gaston
Villere he dismounted and again sat there alone by the stream for
many hours Long rides and outings had been lately so much his custom
that no one thought twice of his absence and when he returned to the
mission in the afternoon the Indian took his mule and he went to his
seat in the garden But it was with another look that he watched the
sea and presently the sail moved across the blue triangle and soon it
had rounded the headland Gastons first coming was in the padres
mind and as the vespers bell began to ring in the cloistered silence a
fragment of Aubers plaintive tune passed like a sigh across his memory

Musical Score Appears Here

But for the repose of Gastons soul they sang all that he had taught
them of Il Trovatore

Thus it happened that Padre Ignazio never went home but remained
cheerful master of the desires to do so that sometimes visited him
until the day came when he was called altogether away from this world
and passed beyond these voices where is peace
