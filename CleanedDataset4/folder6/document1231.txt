The Songs They used to Sing



On the diggings up to twenty odd years agoand as far back as I can
rememberon Lambing Flat the Pipe Clays Gulgong Home Rule and so
through the roaring list in bark huts tents publichouses sly grog
shanties andwell the most glorious voice of all belonged to a bad
girl We were only children and didnt know why she was bad but we
werent allowed to play near or go near the hut she lived in and we
were trained to believe firmly that something awful would happen to us
if we stayed to answer a word and didnt run away as fast as our legs
could carry us if she attempted to speak to us We had before us the
dread example of one urchin who got an awful hiding and went on bread
and water for twentyfour hours for allowing her to kiss him and give
him lollies She didnt look badshe looked to us like a grand and
beautiful ladygirlbut we got instilled into us the idea that she was
an awful bad woman something more terrible even than a drunken man and
one whose presence was to be feared and fled from There were two other
girls in the hut with her also a pretty little girl who called her
Auntie and with whom we were not allowed to playfor they were all
bad which puzzled us as much as childminds can be puzzled We couldnt
make out how everybody in one house could be bad We used to wonder why
these bad people werent hunted away or put in gaol if they were so
bad And another thing puzzled us Slipping out after dark when the bad
girls happened to be singing in their house wed sometimes run against
men hanging round the hut by ones and twos and threes listening They
seemed mysterious They were mostly good men and we concluded they were
listening and watching the bad womens house to see that they didnt
kill anyone or steal and run away with any bad little boysourselves
for instancewho ran out after dark which as we were informed those
bad people were always on the lookout for a chance to do

We were told in after years that old Peter McKenzie a respectable
married hardworking digger would sometimes steal up opposite the bad
door in the dark and throw in money done up in a piece of paper and
listen round until the bad girl had sung the Bonnie Hills of Scotland
two or three times Then hed go and get drunk and stay drunk two or
three days at a time And his wife caught him throwing the money in one
night and there was a terrible row and she left him and people always
said it was all a mistake But we couldnt see the mistake then

But I can hear that girls voice through the night twenty years ago

 Oh the bloomin heath and the pale blue bell
 In my bonnet then I wore
 And memory knows no brighter theme
 Than those happy days of yore
 Scotland Land of chief and song
 Oh what charms to thee belong

And I am old enough to understand why poor Peter McKenziewho was
married to a Saxon and a Tartarwent and got drunk when the bad girl
sang The Bonnie Hills of Scotland

 His anxious eye might look in vain
 For some loved form it knew

     

And yet another thing puzzled us greatly at the time Next door to the
bad girls house there lived a very respectable familya family of good
girls with whom we were allowed to play and from whom we got lollies
those hard old redandwhite fish lollies that grocers sent home with
parcels of groceries and receipted bills Now one washing day they
being as glad to get rid of us at home as we were to get out we went
over to the good house and found no one at home except the grownup
daughter who used to sing for us and read Robinson Crusoe of nights
out loud and give us more lollies than any of the restand with
whom we were passionately in love notwithstanding the fact that she was
engaged to a grownup manwe reckoned hed be dead and out of the
way by the time we were old enough to marry her She was washing
She had carried the stool and tub over against the stick fence which
separated her house from the bad house and to our astonishment and
dismay the bad girl had brought HER tub over against her side of the
fence They stood and worked with their shoulders to the fence between
them and heads bent down close to it The bad girl would sing a few
words and the good girl after her over and over again They sang very
low we thought Presently the good grownup girl turned her head and
caught sight of us She jumped and her face went flaming red she laid
hold of the stool and carried it tub and all away from that fence in
a hurry And the bad grownup girl took her tub back to her house The
good grownup girl made us promise never to tell what we sawthat shed
been talking to a bad girlelse she would never never marry us

She told me in after years when shed grown up to be a grandmother
that the bad girl was surreptitiously teaching her to sing Madeline
that day

I remember a dreadful story of a digger who went and shot himself
one night after hearing that bad girl sing We thought then what a
frightfully bad woman she must be The incident terrified us and
thereafter we kept carefully and fearfully out of reach of her voice
lest we should go and do what the digger did

     

I have a dreamy recollection of a circus on Gulgong in the roaring days
more than twenty years ago and a woman to my childfancy a being from
another world standing in the middle of the ring singing

 Out in the cold worldout in the street
 Asking a penny from each one I meet
 Cheerless I wander about all the day
 Wearing my young life in sorrow away

That last line haunted me for many years I remember being frightened by
women sobbing and one or two great grownup diggers also that night in
that circus

Father Dear Father Come Home with Me Now was a sacred song then
not a peg for vulgar parodies and more vulgar business for fourthrate
clowns and cornermen Then there was The Prairie Flower Out on the
Prairie in an Early DayI can hear the diggers wife yet she was the
prettiest girl on the field They married on the sly and crept into
camp after dark but the diggers got wind of it and rolled up with
golddishes shovels c c and gave them a real good tinkettling in
the oldfashioned style and a nugget or two to start housekeeping on
She had a very sweet voice

 Fair as a lily joyous and free
 Light of the prairie home was she

Shes a granny now no doubtor dead

And I remember a poor brutally illused little wife wearing a black
eye mostly and singing Love Amongst the Roses at her work And they
sang the Blue Tail Fly and all the first and best coon songsin the
days when old John Brown sank a duffer on the hill

     

The great bark kitchen of Granny Mathews Redclay Inn A fresh
backlog thrown behind the fire which lights the room fitfully Company
settled down to pipes subdued yarning and reverie

Flash Jackred sash cabbagetree hat on back of head with nothing
in it glossy black curls bunched up in front of brim Flash Jack
volunteers without invitation preparation or warning and through his
nose

 Hoh
 There was a wild kerlonial youth
 John Dowlin was his name
 He bountied on his parients
 Who lived in Castlemaine

and so on to

 He took a pistol from his breast
 And waved that little toy

Little toy with an enthusiastic flourish and great unction on Flash
Jacks part

 Ill fight but I wont surrender said
 The wild Kerlonial Boy

Even this fails to rouse the companys enthusiasm Give us a song Abe
Give us the Lowlands Abe Mathews bearded and grizzled is lying
on the broad of his back on a bench with his hands clasped under his
headhis favourite position for smoking reverie yarning or singing
He had a strong deep voice which used to thrill me through and
through from hair to toenails as a child

They bother Abe till he takes his pipe out of his mouth and puts it
behind his head on the end of the stool

 The ship was built in Glasgow
 Twas the Golden Vanitee
Lines have dropped out of my memory during the thirty years gone
between

 And she ploughed in the Low Lands Low

The publichouse people and more diggers drop into the kitchen as all
do within hearing when Abe sings

Now then boys

 And she ploughed in the Low Lands Low

Now all together

 The Low Lands The Low Lands
 And she ploughed in the Low Lands Low

Toe and heel and flat of foot begin to stamp the clay floor and horny
hands to slap patched knees in accompaniment

 Oh save me lads he cried
 Im drifting with the current
 And Im drifting with the tide
 And Im sinking in the Low Lands Low

 The Low Lands The Low Lands

The old bark kitchen is agoing now Heels drumming on gincases under
stools hands knuckles pipebowls and pannikins keeping time on the
table

 And we sewed him in his hammock
 And we slipped him oer the side
 And we sunk him in the Low Lands Low
 The Low Lands The Low Lands
 And we sunk him in the Low Lands Low

Old Boozer Smitha dirty ginsodden bundle of rags on the floor in the
corner with its head on a candle box and covered by a horse rugold
Boozer Smith is supposed to have been dead to the universe for hours
past but the chorus must have disturbed his torpor for with a
suddenness and unexpectedness that makes the next man jump there comes
a bellow from under the horse rug

 Wot thoughI weara ragged coat
 Ill wear it like a man

and ceases as suddenly as it commenced He struggles to bring his ruined
head and bloated face above the surface glares round then no one
questioning his manhood he sinks back and dies to creation and
subsequent proceedings are only interrupted by a snore as far as he is
concerned

Little Jimmy Nowlett the bullockdriver is inspired Go on Jimmy
Give us a song

 In the days when we were hard up
 For want of wood and wire
Jimmy always blunders it should have been food and fire

 We used to tie our boots up
 With little bitser wire

and

 Im sitting in my little room
 It measures six by six
 The workhouse wall is opposite
 Ive counted all the bricks

Give us a chorus Jimmy

Jimmy does giving his head a short jerky nod for nearly every word
and describing a circle round his crownas if he were stirring a pint
of hot teawith his forefinger at the end of every line

 HallRoundMeHat
 I wore a weepin willer

Jimmy is a Cockney

Now then boys

 Hallroundme hat

How many old diggers remember it

And

 A butcher and a baker and a quietlooking quaker
 All acourting pretty Jessie at the Railway Bar

I used to wonder as a child what the railway bar meant

And

 I would I would I would in vain
 That I were single once again
 But ah alas that will not be
 Till apples grow on the willow tree

A drunken gamblers young wife used to sing that songto herself

A stir at the kitchen door and a cry of Pinter and old Poynton
Ballarat digger appears and is shoved in he has several drinks aboard
and they proceed to git Pinter on the singin lay and at last talk
him round He has a good voice but no theory and blunders worse than
Jimmy Nowlett with the words He starts with a howl

 Hoh
 Way down in Covent Gararrdings
 Astrolling I did go
 To see the sweetest flowowwers
 That eer in gardings grow

He saw the rose and lilythe red and white and blueand he saw the
sweetest flowowers that eer in gardings grew for he saw two lovely
maidens Pinter calls em virgings underneath he must have meant on
top of a garding chair sings Pinter

 And one was lovely Jessie
 With the jet black eyes and hair

roars Pinter

 And the other was a virirging
 I solemnlye declare

Maiden Pinter interjects Mr Nowlett

Well its all the same retorts Pinter A maiden IS a virging
Jimmy If youre singing Jimmy and not me Ill leave off Chorus of
Order Shut up Jimmy

 I quicklye stepped up to her
 And unto her did saay
 Do you belong to any young man
 Hoh tell me that I praay

Her answer according to Pinter was surprisingly prompt and
unconventional also full and concise

 No I belong to no young man
 I solemnlye declare
 I mean to live a virging
 And still my laurels wear

Jimmy Nowlett attempts to move an amendment in favour of maiden
but is promptly suppressed It seems that Pinters suit has a happy
termination for he is supposed to sing in the character of a Sailor
Bold and as he turns to pursue his stroll in Covent Garardings

 Oh no Oh no Oh no she cried
 I love a Sailor Bold

Hongkore Pinter Give us the Golden Glove Pinter

Thus warmed up Pinter starts with an explanatory spoken to the effect
that the song he is about to sing illustrates some of the little ways of
woman and how no matter what you say or do she is bound to have her
own way in the end also how in one instance she set about getting it

Hoh

 Now its of a young squoire near Timworth did dwell
 Who courted a noblemans daughter so well

The song has little or nothing to do with the squire except so far as
all friends and relations had given consent and

 The troosoo was orderedappointed the day
 And a farmer were appointed for to give her away

which last seemed a most unusual proceeding considering the wedding was
a toney affair but perhaps there were personal intereststhe nobleman
might have been hard up and the farmer backing him But there was an
extraordinary scene in the church and things got mixed

 For as soon as this maiding this farmer espied
 Hoh my heart Hoh my heart
 Hoh my heart then she cried

Hysterics Anyway instead of being wed

 This maiden took sick and she went to her bed

NBPinter sticks to virging

Whereupon friends and relations and guests left the house in a body a
strange but perhaps a wise proceeding after allmaybe they smelt a
rat and left her to recover alone which she did promptly And then

 Shirt breeches and waistcoat this maiding put on
 And ahunting she went with her dog and her gun
 She hunted all round where this farmier did dwell
 Because in her own heart she loveed him well

The cats out of the bag now

 And often she fired but no game she killed

which was not surprising

 Till at last the young farmier came into the field

No wonder She put it to him straight

 Oh why are you not at the wedding she cried
 For to wait on the squoire and to give him his bride

He was as prompt and as delightfully unconventional in his reply as the
young lady in Covent Gardings

 Oh no and oh no For the truth I must saay
 I love her too well for to give her awaay

which was satisfactory to the disguised virging

  and Id take sword in hand
 And by honour Id win her if she would command

Which was still more satisfactory

 Now this virging being
Jimmy Nowlett Maiden Pinter Jim is thrown on a stool and sat on
by several diggers

 Now this maiding being pleaseed to see him so bold
 She gave him her glove that was flowered with gold

and explained that she found it in his field while hunting around with
her dog and her gun It is understood that he promised to look up
the owner Then she went home and put an advertisement in the local
Herald and that ad must have caused considerable sensation She
stated that she had lost her golden glove and

 The young man that finds it and brings it to me
 Hoh that very young man my husband shall be

She had a saving clause in case the young farmer mislaid the glove
before he saw the ad and an OLD bloke got holt of it and fetched it
along But everything went all right The young farmer turned up with
the glove He was a very respectable young farmer and expressed his
gratitude to her for having honoured him with her love They were
married and the song ends with a picture of the young farmeress milking
the cow and the young farmer going whistling to plough The fact that
they lived and grafted on the selection proves that I hit the right nail
on the head when I guessed in the first place that the old nobleman
was stony

In after years

  she told him of the fun
 How she hunted him up with her dog and her gun

But whether he was pleased or otherwise to hear it after years of
matrimonial experiences the old song doesnt say for it ends there

Flash Jack is more successful with Saint Patricks Day

 I come to the river I jumped it quite clever
 Me wife tumbled in and I lost her for ever
 St Patricks own day in the mornin

This is greatly appreciated by Jimmy Nowlett who is suspected
especially by his wife of being more cheerful when on the roads than
when at home

     

Sam Holt was a great favourite with Jimmy Nowlett in after years

 Oh do you remember Black Alice Sam Holt
 Black Alice so dirty and dark
 Whod a nose on her faceI forget how it goes
 And teeth like a Moreton Bay shark

Sam Holt must have been very hard up for tucker as well as beauty then
for

 Do you remember the possums and grubs
 She baked for you down by the creek

Sam Holt was apparently a hardened flash Jack

 You were not quite the cleanly potato Sam Holt

Reference is made to his manner of holding a flush and he is asked
to remember several things which he no doubt would rather forget
including

  the hiding you got from the boys

The song is decidedly personal

But Sam Holt makes a pile and goes home leaving many a better and worse
man to pad the hoof Out Back AndJim Nowlett sang this with so much
feeling as to make it appear a personal affair between him and the
absent Holt

 And dont you remember the fiver Sam Holt
 You borrowed so careless and free
 I reckon Ill whistle a good many tunes

with increasing feeling

 Ere you think of that fiver and me

For the chances will be that Sam Holts old mate

 Will be humping his drum on the Hughenden Road
 To the end of the chapter of fate

     

An echo from The Old Bark Hut sung in the opposition camp across the
gully

 You may leave the door ajar but if you keep it shut
 Theres no need of suffocation in the Ould Barrk Hut

     

 The tuckers in the gincase but youd better keep it shut
 For the flies will canther round it in the Ould Bark Hut

However

 Whats out of sight is out of mind in the Ould Bark Hut

     

 We washed our greasy moleskins
 On the banks of the Condamine

Somebody tackling the Old Bullock Dray it must be over fifty verses
now I saw a bushman at a country dance start to sing that song hed
get up to ten or fifteen verses break down and start afresh At last
he sat down on his heel to it in the centre of the clear floor resting
his wrist on his knee and keeping time with an index finger It was
very funny but the thing was taken seriously all through

Irreverent echo from the old Lambing Flat trouble from camp across the
gully

 Rule Britannia Britannia rules the waves
 No more Chinamen will enter Noo South Wales

and

 Yankee Doodle came to town
 On a little pony
 Stick a feather in his cap
 And call him Maccaroni

All the camps seem to be singing tonight

 Ring the bell watchman
 Ring Ring Ring
 Ring for the good news
 Is now on the wing

Good lines the introduction

 High on the belfry the old sexton stands
 Grasping the rope with his thin bony hands
 Bonfires are blazing throughout the land
 Glorious and blessed tidings Ring Ring the bell

     

Granny Mathews fails to coax her niece into the kitchen but persuades
her to sing inside She is the girl who learnt sub rosa from the bad
girl who sang Madeline Such as have them on instinctively take their
hats off Diggers c strolling past halt at the first notes of the
girls voice and stand like statues in the moonlight

 Shall we gather at the river
 Where bright angel feet have trod
 The beautifulthe beautiful river
 That flows by the throne of God

Diggers wanted to send that girl Home but Granny Mathews had the
oldfashioned horror of any of her children becoming public

 Gather with the saints at the river
 That flows by the throne of God

     

But it grows late or rather early The Eyetalians go by in the
frosty moonlight from their last shift in the claim for it is Saturday
night singing a litany

Get up on one end Abestand up all Hands are clasped across the
kitchen table Redclay one of the last of the alluvial fields has
petered out and the Roaring Days are dying The grand old song that
is known all over the world yet how many in ten thousand know more than
one verse and the chorus Let Peter McKenzie lead

 Should auld acquaintance be forgot
 And never brought to min

And hearts echo from far back in the past and across wide wide seas

 Should auld acquaintance be forgot
 And days o lang syne

Now boys all together

 For auld lang syne my dear
 For auld lang syne
 Well tak a cup o kindness yet
 For auld lang syne

 We twa hae run about the braes
 And pud the gowans fine
 But weve wandered mony a weary foot
 Sin auld lang syne

The world was wide then

 We twa hae paidlt i the burn
 Frae mornin sun till dine

the log fire seems to grow watery for in wide lonely Australia
 But seas between us braid hae roard
 Sin auld lang syne

The kitchen grows dimmer and the forms of the diggersingers seemed
suddenly vague and unsubstantial fading back rapidly through a misty
veil But the words ring strong and defiant through hard years

 And heres a hand my trusty frien
 And gies a grup o thine
 And well tak a cup o kindness yet
 For auld lang syne

     

And the nettles have been growing for over twenty years on the spot
where Granny Mathews big bark kitchen stood




A Vision of Sandy Blight


Id been humping my back and crouching and groaning for an hour or so
in the darkest corner of the travellers hut tortured by the demon
of sandy blight It was too hot to travel and there was no one there
except ourselves and Mitchells cattle pup We were waiting till after
sundown for I couldnt have travelled in the daylight anyway Mitchell
had tied a wet towel round my eyes and led me for the last mile or two
by another towelone end fastened to his belt behind and the other in
my hand as I walked in his tracks And oh but this was a relief It was
out of the dust and glare and the flies didnt come into the dark hut
and I could hump and stick my knees in my eyes and groan in comfort I
didnt want a thousand a year or anything I only wanted relief for my
eyesthat was all I prayed for in this world When the sun got down a
bit Mitchell started poking round and presently he found amongst the
rubbish a dirtylooking medicine bottle corked tight when he rubbed
the dirt off a piece of notepaper that was pasted on he saw eyewater
written on it He drew the cork with his teeth smelt the water stuck
his little finger in turned the bottle upside down tasted the top of
his finger and reckoned the stuff was all right

Here Wake up Joe he shouted Heres a bottle of tears

A bottler wot I groaned

Eyewater said Mitchell

Are you sure its all right I didnt want to be poisoned or have my
eyes burnt out by mistake perhaps some burning acid had got into
that bottle or the label had been put on or left on in mistake or
carelessness

I dunno said Mitchell but theres no harm in tryin

I chanced it I lay down on my back in a bunk and Mitchell dragged my
lids up and spilt half a bottle of eyewater over my eyeballs

The relief was almost instantaneous I never experienced such a quick
cure in my life I carried the bottle in my swag for a long time
afterwards with an idea of getting it analysed but left it behind at
last in a camp

Mitchell scratched his head thoughtfully and watched me for a while

I think Ill wait a bit longer he said at last and if it doesnt
blind you Ill put some in my eyes Im getting a touch of blight myself
now Thats the fault of travelling with a mate whos always catching
something thats no good to him

As it grew dark outside we talked of sandyblight and flybite and
sandflies up north and ordinary flies and branched off to Barcoo rot
and struck the track again at bees and bee stings When we got to bees
Mitchell sat smoking for a while and looking dreamily backwards
along tracks and branch tracks and round corners and circles he had
travelled right back to the short narrow innocent bit of track that
ends in a vague misty pointlike the end of a long straight cleared
road in the moonlightas far back as we can remember

     

I had about fourteen hives said Mitchellwe used to call them
swarms no matter whether they were flying or in the boxwhen I left
home first time I kept them behind the shed in the shade on tables
of galvanised iron cases turned down on stakes but I had to make legs
later on and stand them in pans of water on account of the ants When
the bees swarmedand some hives sent out the Lord knows how many swarms
in a year it seemed to mewed tinkettle em and throw water on em
to make em believe the biggest thunderstorm was coming to drown the
oldest inhabitant and if they didnt get the start of us and rise
theyd settle on a branchgenerally on one of the scraggy fruit trees
It was rough on the beescome to think of it their instinct told
them it was going to be fine and the noise and water told them it was
raining They must have thought that nature was mad drunk or gone
ratty or the end of the world had come Wed rig up a table with a box
upside down under the branch cover our face with a piece of mosquito
net have rags burning round and then give the branch a sudden jerk
turn the box down and run If we got most of the bees in the rest
that were hanging to the bough or flying round would follow and then
we reckoned wed shook the queen in If the bees in the box came out and
joined the others wed reckon we hadnt shook the queen in and go for
them again When a hive was full of honey wed turn the box upside down
turn the empty box mouth down on top of it and drum and hammer on the
lower box with a stick till all the bees went up into the top box I
suppose it made their heads ache and they went up on that account

I suppose things are done differently on proper beefarms Ive heard
that a beefarmer will part a hanging swarm with his fingers take out
the queen bee and arrange matters with her but our ways suited us
and there was a lot of expectation and running and excitement in
it especially when a swarm took us by surprise The yell of Bees
swarmin was as good to us as the yell of Fight is now or Bolt
in town or Fire or Man overboard at sea

There was tons of honey The bees used to go to the vineyards at
winemaking and get honey from the heaps of crushed grapeskins thrown
out in the sun and get so drunk sometimes that they wobbled in their
beelines home Theyd fill all the boxes and then build in between and
under the bark and board and tin covers They never seemed to get the
idea out of their heads that this wasnt an evergreen country and it
wasnt going to snow all winter My younger brother Joe used to put
pieces of meat on the tables near the boxes and in front of the holes
where the bees went in and out for the dogs to grab at But one old
dog Black Bill was a match for him if it was worth Bills while
hed camp there and keep Joe and the other dogs from touching the
meatonce it was put downtill the bees turned in for the night And
Joe would get the other kids round there and when they werent looking
or thinking hed brush the bees with a stick and run Id lam him when
I caught him at it He was an awful young devil was Joe and he grew up
steady and respectable and respectedand I went to the bad I never
trust a good boy now Ah well

I remember the first swarm we got Wed been talking of getting a few
swarms for a long time That was what was the matter with us English
and Irish and EnglishIrish Australian farmers we used to talk so much
about doing things while the Germans and Scotch did them And we even
talked in a lazy easygoing sort of way

Well one blazing hot day I saw father coming along the road home
to dinner we had it in the middle of the day with his axe over his
shoulder I noticed the axe particularly because father was bringing it
home to grind and Joe and I had to turn the stone but when I noticed
Joe dragging along home in the dust about fifty yards behind father I
felt easier in my mind Suddenly father dropped the axe and started
to run back along the road towards Joe who as soon as he saw father
coming shied for the fence and got through He thought he was going to
catch it for something hed doneor hadnt done Joe used to do so many
things and leave so many things not done that he could never be sure
of father Besides father had a way of starting to hammer us
unexpectedlywhen the idea struck him But father pulled himself up in
about thirty yards and started to grab up handfuls of dust and sand and
throw them into the air My idea in the first flash was to get hold of
the axe for I thought it was sunstroke and father might take it into
his head to start chopping up the family before I could persuade him
to put it his head I mean in a bucket of water But Joe came running
like mad yelling

Swarmerbees Swawmmerbeeeees
Bringatindishandadipperawaater

I ran with a bucket of water and an old fryingpan and pretty soon
the rest of the family were on the spot throwing dust and water
and banging everything tin or iron they could get hold of The only
bullock bell in the district if it was in the district was on the old
poley cow and shed been lost for a fortnight Mother brought up the
rearbut soon worked to the frontwith a bakingdish and a big spoon
The old ladyshe wasnt old thenhad a deeprooted prejudice that she
could do everything better than anybody else and that the selection
and all on it would go to the dogs if she wasnt there to look after it
There was no jolting that idea out of her She not only believed that
she could do anything better than anybody and hers was the only right
or possible way and that wed do everything upside down if she wasnt
there to do it or show us howbut shed try to do things herself or
insist on making us do them her way and that led to messes and rows
She was excited now and took command at once She wasnt tonguetied
and had no impediment in her speech

Dont throw up dustStop throwing up dustDo you want to smother
emDont throw up so much waterOnly throw up a pannikin at a
timeDyer want to drown em Bang Keep on banging JoeLook at
that child Run someonerun you JackDyer want the child to be
stung to deathTake her inside Dy hear me Stop throwing up
dust Tom To father Youre scaring em away Cant you see they want
to settle Father was getting mad and yelping For Godsake shettup
and go inside Throw up water Jack Throw upTom Take that bucket
from him and dont make such a fool of yourself before the children
Throw up water Throwkeep on banging children Keep on banging
Mother put her faith in banging Theretheyre off Youve lost
em I knew you would I told yerkeep on bang

A bee struck her in the eye and she grabbed at it

Mother went homeand inside

Father was good at beescould manage them like sheep when he got to
know their ideas When the swarm settled he sent us for the old washing
stool boxes bags and so on and the whole time he was fixing the bees
I noticed that whenever his back was turned to us his shoulders would
jerk up as if he was cold and he seemed to shudder from inside and now
and then Id hear a grunting sort of whimper like a boy that was
just starting to blubber But father wasnt weeping and bees werent
stinging him it was the bee that stung mother that was tickling father
When he went into the house mothers other eye had bunged for sympathy
Father was always gentle and kind in sickness and he bathed mothers
eyes and rubbed mud on but every now and then hed catch inside and
jerk and shudder and grunt and cough Mother got wild but presently
the humour of it struck her and she had to laugh and a rum laugh it
was with both eyes bunged up Then she got hysterical and started to
cry and father put his arm round her shoulder and ordered us out of the
house

They were very fond of each other the old people were under it
allright up to the end Ah well

Mitchell pulled the swags out of a bunk and started to fasten the
nosebags on

 That was the picture of Andy
 Middletons rouseabout
 On Middletons wide dominions
 Plied the stockwhip and shears
 Hadnt any opinions

And he hadnt any ideersat least he said so himselfexcept
as regarded anything that looked to him like what he called funny
business under which heading he catalogued tyranny treachery
interference with the liberty of the subject by the subject blanky
lies or swindlesall things in short that seemed to his slow
understanding dishonest mean or paltry most especially and above all
treachery to a mate THAT he could never forget Andy was uncomfortably
straight His mind worked slowly and his decisions were as a rule
right and just and when he once came to a conclusion concerning any
man or matter or decided upon a course of action nothing short of an
earthquake or a Nevertire cyclone could move him back an inchunless a
conviction were severely shaken and then he would require as much time
to back to his starting point as he did to come to the decision

Andy had come to a conclusion with regard to a selectors
daughtername Lizzie Porterwho lived and slaved on her fathers
selection near the township corner of the run on which Andy was a
general hand He had been in the habit for several years of calling
casually at the selectors house as he rode to and fro between the
station and the town to get a drink of water and exchange the time of
day with old Porter and his missus The conversation concerned the
drought and the likelihood or otherwise of their ever going to get
a little rain or about Porters cattle with an occasional enquiry
concerning or reference to a stray cow belonging to the selection
but preferring the run a little plump saucy white cow bytheway
practically pure white but referred to by Andywho had eyes like a
blackfellowas old Speckledy No one else could detect a spot or
speckle on her at a casual glance Then after a long bovine silence
which would have been painfully embarrassing in any other society and
a tilting of his cabbagetree hat forward which came of tickling and
scratching the sunblotched nape of his neck with his little finger
Andy would slowly say Ah well I must be gettin Solong Mr
Porter Solong Mrs Porter And if SHE were in evidenceas she
generally was on such occasionsSolong Lizzie And theyd shout
Solong Andy as he galloped off from the jump Strange that those
shy quiet gentlevoiced bushmen seem the hardest and most reckless
riders

But of late his horse had been seen hanging up outside Porters for an
hour or so after sunset He smoked talked over the results of the last
drought if it happened to rain and the possibilities of the next one
and played cards with old Porter who took to winking automatically at
his old woman and nudging and jerking his thumb in the direction of
Lizzie when her back was turned and Andy was scratching the nape of his
neck and staring at the cards

Lizzie told a lady friend of mine years afterwards how Andy popped
the question told it in her quiet wayyou know Lizzies quiet way
something of the old privileged housecat about her never a sign in
expression or tone to show whether she herself saw or appreciated the
humour of anything she was telling no matter how comical it might be
She had witnessed two tragedies and had found a dead man in the bush
and related the incidents as though they were commonplace

It happened one dayafter Andy had been coming two or three times a
week for about a yearthat she found herself sitting with him on a log
of the woodheap in the cool of the evening enjoying the sunset breeze
Andys arm had got round herjust as it might have gone round a post he
happened to be leaning against They hadnt been talking about anything
in particular Andy said he wouldnt be surprised if they had a
thunderstorm before morninit had been so smotherin hot all day

Lizzie said Very likely

Andy smoked a good while then he said Ah well Its a weary world

Lizzie didnt say anything

Byandbye Andy said Ah well its a lonely world Lizzie

Do you feel lonely Andy asked Lizzie after a while

Yes Lizzie I do

Lizzie let herself settle a little against him without either seeming
to notice it and after another while she said softly So do I Andy

Andy knocked the ashes from his pipe very slowly and deliberately and
put it away then he seemed to brighten suddenly and said briskly
Well Lizzie Are you satisfied

Yes Andy Im satisfied

Quite sure now

Yes Im quite sure Andy Im perfectly satisfied

Well then Lizzieits settled

     

But todaya couple of months after the proposal described aboveAndy
had trouble on his mind and the trouble was connected with Lizzie
Porter He was putting up a tworail fence along the old logpaddock on
the frontage and working like a man in trouble trying to work it off
his mind and evidently not succeedingfor the last two panels were out
of line He was ramming a postAndy rammed honestly from the bottom of
the hole not the last few shovelfuls below the surface as some do He
was ramming the last layer of clay when a cloud of white dust came along
the road paused and drifted or poured off into the scrub leaving long
Dave Bentley the horsebreaker on his last victim

Ello Andy Graftin

I want to speak to you Dave said Andy in a strange voice

Allall right said Dave rather puzzled He got down wondering what
was up and hung his horse to the last post but one

Dave was Andys opposite in one respect he jumped to conclusions as
women do but unlike women he was mostly wrong He was an old chum and
mate of Andys who had always liked admired and trusted him But
now to his helpless surprise Andy went on scraping the earth from the
surface with his longhandled shovel and heaping it conscientiously
round the butt of the post his face like a block of wood and his lips
set grimly Dave broke out first with bush oaths

Whats the matter with you Spit it out What have I been doin to you
Whats yer got yer rag out about anyway

Andy faced him suddenly with hatred for funny business flashing in
his eyes

What did you say to my sister Mary about Lizzie Porter

Dave started then he whistled long and low Spit it all out Andy he
advised

You said she was travellin with a feller

Well whats the harm in that Everybody knows that

If any crawler says a word about Lizzie Porterlook here me and yous
got to fight Dave Bentley Then with still greater vehemence as
though he had a share in the garment Take off that coat

Not if I know it said Dave with the sudden quietness that comes to
brave but headstrong and impulsive men at a critical moment Me and you
aint goin to fight Andy and with sudden energy if you try it on
Ill knock you into jimrags

Then stepping close to Andy and taking him by the arm Andy this
thing will have to be fixed up Come here I want to talk to you And
he led him some paces aside inside the boundary line which seemed a
ludicrously unnecessary precaution seeing that there was no one within
sight or hearing save Daves horse

Now look here Andy lets have it over Whats the matter with you
and Lizzie Porter

IM travellin with her thats all and were going to get married in
two years

Dave gave vent to another long low whistle He seemed to think and make
up his mind

Now look here Andy were old mates aint we

Yes I know that

And do you think Id tell you a blanky lie or crawl behind your back
Do you Spit it out

Nno I dont

Ive always stuck up for you Andy andwhy Ive fought for you
behind your back

I know that Dave

Theres my hand on it

Andy took his friends hand mechanically but gripped it hard

Now Andy Ill tell you straight Its Gorstruth about Lizzie Porter

They stood as they were for a full minute hands clasped Andy with his
jaw dropped and staring in a dazed sort of way at Dave He raised his
disengaged hand helplessly to his thatch gulped suspiciously and asked
in a broken voice

Howhow do you know it Dave

Know it Andy I SEEN EM MESELF

You did Dave in a tone that suggested sorrow more than anger at
Daves part in the seeing of them

Gorstruth Andy

     

Tell me Dave who was the feller Thats all I want to know

I cant tell you that I only seen them when I was canterin past in
the dusk

Then howd you know it was a man at all

It wore trousers anyway and was as big as you so it couldnt have
been a girl Im pretty safe to swear it was Mick Kelly I saw his horse
hangin up at Porters once or twice But Ill tell you what Ill do
Ill find out for you Andy And whats more Ill job him for you if I
catch him

Andy said nothing his hands clenched and his chest heaved Dave laid a
friendly hand on his shoulder

Its red hot Andy I know Anybody else but you and I wouldnt have
cared But dont be a fool theres any Gorsquantity of girls knockin
round You just give it to her straight and chuck her and have done
with it You must be bad off to bother about her Gorstruth she aint
much to look at anyway Ive got to ride like blazes to catch the coach
Dont knock off till I come back I wont be above an hour Im goin to
give you some points in case youve got to fight Mick and Ill have to
be there to back you And thus taking the right moment instinctively
he jumped on his horse and galloped on towards the town

His dustcloud had scarcely disappeared round a corner of the paddocks
when Andy was aware of another one coming towards him He had a
dazed idea that it was Dave coming back but went on digging another
posthole mechanically until a springcart rattled up and stopped
opposite him Then he lifted his head It was Lizzie herself driving
home from town She turned towards him with her usual faint smile Her
small features were washed out and rather haggard

Ello Andy

But at the sight of her all his hatred of funny
businessintensified perhaps by a sense of personal injurycame to
a head and he exploded

Look here Lizzie Porter I know all about you You neednt think
youre goin to cotton on with me any more after this I wouldnt be
seen in a paddock with yer Im satisfied about you Get on out of
this

The girl stared at him for a moment thunderstruck then she lammed into
the old horse with a stick she carried in place of a whip

She cried and wondered what shed done and trembled so that she could
scarcely unharness the horse and wondered if Andy had got a touch of
the sun and went in and sat down and cried again and pride came to her
aid and she hated Andy thought of her big brother away droving and
made a cup of tea She shed tears over the tea and went through it all
again

Meanwhile Andy was suffering a reaction He started to fill the hole
before he put the post in then to ram the post before the rails were
in position Dubbing off the ends of the rails he was in danger of
amputating a toe or a foot with every stroke of the adze And at last
trying to squint along the little lumps of clay which he had placed in
the centre of the top of each post for several panels backto assist
him to take a linehe found that they swam and doubled and ran off in
watery angles for his eyes were too moist to see straight and single

Then he threw down the tools hopelessly and was standing helplessly
undecided whether to go home or go down to the creek and drown himself
when Dave turned up again

Seen her asked Dave

Yes said Andy

Did you chuck her

Look here Dave are you sure the feller was Mick Kelly

I never said I was How was I to know It was dark You dont expect
Id fox a feller I see doing a bit of a bearup to a girl do you It
might have been you for all I knowed I suppose shes been talking you
round

No she aint said Andy But look here Dave I was properly gone
on that girl I was andand I want to be sure Im right

The business was getting altogether too psychological for Dave Bentley
You might as well he rapped out call me a liar at once

Taint that at all Dave I want to get at who the feller is thats
what I want to get at now Where did you see them and when

I seen them Anniversary night along the road near Ross farm and
I seen em Sunday night afore thatin the trees near the old
culvertnear Porters sliprails and I seen em one night outside
Porters on a log near the woodheap They was thick that time and
bearin up proper and no mistake So I can swear to her Now are you
satisfied about her

But Andy was wildly pitchforking his thatch under his hat with all ten
fingers and staring at Dave who began to regard him uneasily then
there came to Andys eyes an awful glare which caused Dave to step back
hastily

Good God Andy Are yer goin ratty

No cried Andy wildly

Then what the blazes is the matter with you Youll have rats if you
dont look out

JIMMINY FROTHIt was ME all the time

What

It was me that was with her all them nights It was me that you seen
WHY I POPPED ON THE WOODHEAP

Dave was taken too suddenly to whistle this time

And you went for her just now

Yes yelled Andy

Wellyouve done it

Yes said Andy hopelessly Ive done it

Dave whistled nowa very long low whistle Well youre a bloomin
goat Andy after this But this thingll have to be fixed up and he
cantered away Poor Andy was too badly knocked to notice the abruptness
of Daves departure or to see that he turned through the sliprails on
to the track that led to Porters

     

Half an hour later Andy appeared at Porters back door with an
expression on his face as though the funeral was to start in ten
minutes In a tone befitting such an occasion he wanted to see Lizzie

Dave had been there with the laudable determination of fixing the
business up and had of course succeeded in making it much worse than
it was before But Andy made it all right




The IronBark Chip



Dave Regan and partybushfencers tanksinkers rough carpenters
cwere finishing the third and last culvert of their contract on
the last section of the new railway line and had already sent in their
vouchers for the completed contract so that there might be no excuse
for extra delay in connection with the cheque

Now it had been expressly stipulated in the plans and specifications
that the timber for certain beams and girders was to be ironbark and
no other and Government inspectors were authorised to order the removal
from the ground of any timber or material they might deem inferior
or not in accordance with the stipulations The railway contractors
foreman and inspector of subcontractors was a practical man and a
bushman but he had been a timbergetter himself his sympathies were
bushy and he was on winking terms with Dave Regan Besides extended
time was expiring and the contractors were in a hurry to complete the
line But the Government inspector was a reserved man who poked round
on his independent own and appeared in lonely spots at unexpected
timeswith apparently no definite object in lifelike a grey kangaroo
bothered by a new wire fence but unsuspicious of the presence of
humans He wore a grey suit rode or mostly led an ashengrey horse
the grass was long and grey so he was seldom spotted until he was
well within the horizon and bearing leisurely down on a party of
subcontractors leading his horse

Now ironbark was scarce and distant on those ridges and another
timber similar in appearance but much inferior in grain and standing
quality was plentiful and close at hand Dave and party were about
full of the job and place and wanted to get their cheque and be gone
to another spec they had in view So they came to reckon theyd get
the last girder from a handy tree and have it squared in place and
carefully and conscientiously tarred before the inspector happened
along if he did But they didnt They got it squared and ready to be
lifted into its place the kindly darkness of tar was ready to cover a
fraud that took four strong men with crowbars and levers to shift and
now such is the regular cussedness of things as the fraudulent piece
of timber lay its last hour on the ground looking and smelling to
their guilty imaginations like anything but ironbark they were aware
of the Government inspector drifting down upon them obliquely with
something of the atmosphere of a casual Bill or Jim who had dropped out
of his easygoing track to see how they were getting on and borrow a
match They had more than half hoped that as he had visited them pretty
frequently during the progress of the work and knew how near it was to
completion he wouldnt bother coming any more But its the way with
the Government You might move heaven and earth in vain endeavour to
get the Guvermunt to flutter an eyelash over something of the most
momentous importance to yourself and mates and the districteven to
the country but just when you are leaving authority severely alone and
have strong reasons for not wanting to worry or interrupt it and not
desiring it to worry about you it will take a fancy into its head to
come along and bother

Its always the way muttered Dave to his mates I knew the beggar
would turn up And the only cronk log weve had too he added in
an injured tone If this had a been the only blessed ironbark in the
whole contract it would have been all right Goodday sir to the
inspector Its hot

The inspector nodded He was not of an impulsive nature He got down
from his horse and looked at the girder in an abstracted way and
presently there came into his eyes a dreamy faraway sad sort of
expression as if there had been a very sad and painful occurrence in
his family way back in the past and that piece of timber in some way
reminded him of it and brought the old sorrow home to him He blinked
three times and asked in a subdued tone

Is that ironbark

Jack Bentley the fluent liar of the party caught his breath with a
jerk and coughed to cover the gasp and gain time Iironbark Of
course it is I thought you would know ironbark mister Mister was
silent What else dyer think it is

The dreamy abstracted expression was back The inspector bytheway
didnt know much about timber but he had a great deal of instinct and
went by it when in doubt

Llook here mister put in Dave Regan in a tone of innocent
puzzlement and with a blank bucolic face Bbut dont the plans and
specifications say ironbark Ours does anyway IIll git the papers
from the tent and show yer if yer like

It was not necessary The inspector admitted the fact slowly He
stooped and with an absent air picked up a chip He looked at it
abstractedly for a moment blinked his threefold blink then seeming to
recollect an appointment he woke up suddenly and asked briskly

Did this chip come off that girder

Blank silence The inspector blinked six times divided in threes
rapidly mounted his horse said Day and rode off

Regan and party stared at each other

Whawhat did he do that for asked Andy Page the third in the party

Do what for you fool enquired Dave

Tatake that chip for

Hes taking it to the office snarled Jack Bentley

Whatwhat for What does he want to do that for

To get it blanky well analysed You ass Now are yer satisfied And
Jack sat down hard on the timber jerked out his pipe and said to Dave
in a sharp toothache tone

Gimmiamatch

Wewell what are we to do now enquired Andy who was the hardest
grafter but altogether helpless hopeless and useless in a crisis like
this

Grain and varnish the bloomin culvert snapped Bentley

But Daves eyes that had been ruefully following the inspector
suddenly dilated The inspector had ridden a short distance along the
line dismounted thrown the bridle over a post laid the chip which
was too big to go in his pocket on top of it got through the fence
and was now walking back at an angle across the line in the direction
of the fencing party who had worked up on the other side a little more
than opposite the culvert

Dave took in the lay of the country at a glance and thought rapidly

Gimme an ironbark chip he said suddenly

Bentley who was quickwitted when the track was shown him as is a
kangaroo dog Jack ran by sight not scent glanced in the line of
Daves eyes jumped up and got a chip about the same size as that which
the inspector had taken

Now the lay of the country sloped generally to the line from both
sides and the angle between the inspectors horse the fencing party
and the culvert was well within a clear concave space but a couple
of hundred yards back from the line and parallel to it on the side on
which Daves party worked their timber a fringe of scrub ran to within
a few yards of a point which would be about in line with a single tree
on the cleared slope the horse and the fencing party

Dave took the ironbark chip ran along the bed of the watercourse into
the scrub raced up the siding behind the bushes got safely though
without breathing across the exposed space and brought the tree into
line between him and the inspector who was talking to the fencers Then
he began to work quickly down the slope towards the tree which was a
thin one keeping it in line his arms close to his sides and working
as it were down the trunk of the tree as if the fencing party were
kangaroos and Dave was trying to get a shot at them The inspector
bythebye had a habit of glancing now and then in the direction of his
horse as though under the impression that it was flighty and restless
and inclined to bolt on opportunity It was an anxious moment for all
parties concernedexcept the inspector They didnt want HIM to be
perturbed And just as Dave reached the foot of the tree the inspector
finished what he had to say to the fencers turned and started to walk
briskly back to his horse There was a thunderstorm coming Now was the
critical momentthere were certain prearranged signals between Daves
party and the fencers which might have interested the inspector but
none to meet a case like this

Jack Bentley gasped and started forward with an idea of intercepting
the inspector and holding him for a few minutes in bogus conversation
Inspirations come to one at a critical moment and it flashed on Jacks
mind to send Andy instead Andy looked as innocent and guileless as he
was but was uncomfortable in the vicinity of funny business and
must have an honest excuse Not that that mattered commented Jack
afterwards it would have taken the inspector ten minutes to get at
what Andy was driving at whatever it was

Run Andy Tell him theres a heavy thunderstorm coming and hed better
stay in our humpy till its over Run Dont stand staring like a blanky
fool Hell be gone

Andy started But just then as luck would have it one of the fencers
started after the inspector hailing him as Hi mister He wanted to
be set right about the survey or somethingor to pretend to want to be
set rightfrom motives of policy which I havent time to explain here

That fencer explained afterwards to Daves party that he seen what you
coves was up to and thats why he called the inspector back But he
told them that after they had told their yarnwhich was a mistake

Come back Andy cried Jack Bentley

Dave Regan slipped round the tree down on his hands and knees and made
quick time through the grass which luckily grew pretty tall on the
thirty or forty yards of slope between the tree and the horse Close to
the horse a thought struck Dave that pulled him up and sent a shiver
along his spine and a hungry feeling under it The horse would
break away and bolt But the case was desperate Dave ventured an
interrogatory Cope cope cope The horse turned its head wearily and
regarded him with a mild eye as if hed expected him to come and come
on all fours and wondered what had kept him so long then he went
on thinking Dave reached the foot of the post the horse obligingly
leaning over on the other leg Dave reared head and shoulders cautiously
behind the post like a snake his hand went up twice swiftlythe
first time he grabbed the inspectors chip and the second time he put
the ironbark one in its place He drew down and back and scuttled off
for the tree like a gigantic tailless goanna

A few minutes later he walked up to the culvert from along the creek
smoking hard to settle his nerves

The sky seemed to darken suddenly the first great drops of the
thunderstorm came pelting down The inspector hurried to his horse and
cantered off along the line in the direction of the fettlers camp

He had forgotten all about the chip and left it on top of the post

Dave Regan sat down on the beam in the rain and swore comprehensively




Middletons Peter


 I

 The First Born


The struggling squatter is to be found in Australia as well as the
struggling farmer The Australian squatter is not always the mighty
wool king that English and American authors and other uninformed people
apparently imagine him to be Squatting at the best is but a game of
chance It depends mainly on the weather and that in New South Wales
at least depends on nothing

Joe Middleton was a struggling squatter with a station some distance
to the westward of the furthest line reached by the ordinary new chum
His run at the time of our story was only about six miles square and
his stock was limited in proportion The hands on Joes run consisted
of his brother Dave a middleaged man known only as Middletons Peter
who had been in the service of the Middleton family ever since Joe
Middleton could remember and an old black shepherd with his gin and
two boys

It was in the first year of Joes marriage He had married a very
ordinary girl as far as Australian girls go but in his eyes she was an
angel He really worshipped her

One sultry afternoon in midsummer all the station hands with the
exception of Dave Middleton were congregated about the homestead door
and it was evident from their solemn faces that something unusual was
the matter They appeared to be watching for something or someone across
the flat and the old black shepherd who had been listening intently
with bent head suddenly straightened himself up and cried

I can hear the cart I can see it

You must bear in mind that our blackfellows do not always talk the
gibberish with which they are credited by story writers

It was not until some time after Black Bill had spoken that the
whiteor rather the brownportion of the party could see or even
hear the approaching vehicle At last far out through the trunks of the
native appletrees the cart was seen approaching and as it came nearer
it was evident that it was being driven at a breakneck pace the horses
cantering all the way while the motion of the cart as first one
wheel and then the other sprang from a root or a rut bore a striking
resemblance to the Highland Fling There were two persons in the cart
One was Mother Palmer a stout middleaged party who sometimes did the
duties of a midwife and the other was Dave Middleton Joes brother

The cart was driven right up to the door with scarcely any abatement of
speed and was stopped so suddenly that Mrs Palmer was sent sprawling
on to the horses rump She was quickly helped down and as soon as
she had recovered sufficient breath she followed Black Mary into the
bedroom where young Mrs Middleton was lying looking very pale and
frightened The horse which had been driven so cruelly had not done
blowing before another cart appeared also driven very fast It
contained old Mr and Mrs Middleton who lived comfortably on a small
farm not far from Palmers place

As soon as he had dumped Mrs Palmer Dave Middleton left the cart and
mounting a fresh horse which stood ready saddled in the yard galloped
off through the scrub in a different direction

Half an hour afterwards Joe Middleton came home on a horse that had been
almost ridden to death His mother came out at the sound of his arrival
and he anxiously asked her

How is she

Did you find Doc Wild asked the mother

No confound him exclaimed Joe bitterly He promised me faithfully
to come over on Wednesday and stay until Maggie was right again Now
he has left Deans and goneLord knows where I suppose he is drinking
again How is Maggie

Its all over nowthe child is born Its a boy but she is very weak
Dave got Mrs Palmer here just in time I had better tell you at once
that Mrs Palmer says if we dont get a doctor here tonight poor Maggie
wont live

Good God and what am I to do cried Joe desperately

Is there any other doctor within reach

No there is only the one at B thats forty miles away and he is
laid up with the broken leg he got in the buggy accident Wheres Dave

Gone to Blacks shanty One of Mrs Palmers sons thought he remembered
someone saying that Doc Wild was there last week Thats fifteen miles
away

But it is our only hope said Joe dejectedly I wish to God that I
had taken Maggie to some civilised place a month ago

Doc Wild was a wellknown character among the bushmen of New South
Wales and although the profession did not recognise him and denounced
him as an empiric his skill was undoubted Bushmen had great faith in
him and would often ride incredible distances in order to bring him
to the bedside of a sick friend He drank fearfully but was seldom
incapable of treating a patient he would however sometimes be found
in an obstinate mood and refuse to travel to the side of a sick person
and then the devil himself could not make the doctor budge But for all
this he was very generousa fact that could no doubt be testified to
by many a grateful sojourner in the lonely bush



 II

 The Only Hope


Night came on and still there was no change in the condition of
the young wife and no sign of the doctor Several stockmen from
the neighbouring stations hearing that there was trouble at Joe
Middletons had ridden over and had galloped off on long hopeless
rides in search of a doctor Being generally free from sickness
themselves these bushmen look upon it as a serious business even in its
mildest form what is more their sympathy is always practical where
it is possible for it to be so One day while out on the run after
an outlaw Joe Middleton was badly thrown from his horse and the
breakneck riding that was done on that occasion from the time the horse
came home with empty saddle until the rider was safe in bed and attended
by a doctor was something extraordinary even for the bush

Before the time arrived when Dave Middleton might reasonably have been
expected to return the station people were anxiously watching for him
all except the old blackfellow and the two boys who had gone to yard
the sheep

The party had been increased by Jimmy Nowlett the bullocky who had
just arrived with a load of fencing wire and provisions for Middleton
Jimmy was standing in the moonlight whip in hand looking as anxious as
the husband himself and endeavouring to calculate by mental arithmetic
the exact time it ought to take Dave to complete his double journey
taking into consideration the distance the obstacles in the way and
the chances of horseflesh

But the time which Jimmy fixed for the arrival came without Dave

Old Peter as he was generally called though he was not really old
stood aside in his usual sullen manner his hat drawn down over his
brow and eyes and nothing visible but a thick and very horizontal
black beard from the depth of which emerged large clouds of very strong
tobacco smoke the product of a short black clay pipe

They had almost given up all hope of seeing Dave return that night when
Peter slowly and deliberately removed his pipe and grunted

Hes acomin

He then replaced the pipe and smoked on as before

All listened but not one of them could hear a sound

Yer ears must be pretty sharp for yer age Peter We cant hear him
remarked Jimmy Nowlett

His dog ken said Peter

The pipe was again removed and its abbreviated stem pointed in the
direction of Daves cattle dog who had risen beside his kennel with
pointed ears and was looking eagerly in the direction from which his
master was expected to come

Presently the sound of horses hoofs was distinctly heard

I can hear two horses cried Jimmy Nowlett excitedly

Theres only one said old Peter quietly

A few moments passed and a single horseman appeared on the far side of
the flat

Its Doc Wild on Daves horse cried Jimmy Nowlett Dave dont ride
like that

Its Dave said Peter replacing his pipe and looking more unsociable
than ever

Dave rode up and throwing himself wearily from the saddle stood
ominously silent by the side of his horse

Joe Middleton said nothing but stood aside with an expression of utter
hopelessness on his face

Not there asked Jimmy Nowlett at last addressing Dave

Yes hes there answered Dave impatiently

This was not the answer they expected but nobody seemed surprised

Drunk asked Jimmy

Yes

Here old Peter removed his pipe and pronounced the one wordHow

What the hell do you mean by that muttered Dave whose patience had
evidently been severely tried by the clever but intemperate bush doctor

How drunk explained Peter with great equanimity

Stubborn drunk blind drunk beastly drunk dead drunk and damned well
drunk if thats what you want to know

What did Doc say asked Jimmy

Said he was sickhad lumbagowouldnt come for the Queen of England
said he wanted a course of treatment himself Curse him I have no
patience to talk about him

Id give him a course of treatment muttered Jimmy viciously trailing
the long lash of his bullockwhip through the grass and spitting
spitefully at the ground

Dave turned away and joined Joe who was talking earnestly to his mother
by the kitchen door He told them that he had spent an hour trying to
persuade Doc Wild to come and that before he had left the shanty
Black had promised him faithfully to bring the doctor over as soon as
his obstinate mood wore off

Just then a low moan was heard from the sick room followed by the sound
of Mother Palmers voice calling old Mrs Middleton who went inside
immediately

No one had noticed the disappearance of Peter and when he presently
returned from the stockyard leading the only fresh horse that remained
Jimmy Nowlett began to regard him with some interest Peter transferred
the saddle from Daves horse to the other and then went into a small
room off the kitchen which served him as a bedroom from it he soon
returned with a formidablelooking revolver the chambers of which he
examined in the moonlight in full view of all the company They thought
for a moment the man had gone mad Old Middleton leaped quickly behind
Nowlett and Black Mary who had come out to the cask at the corner for
a dipper of water dropped the dipper and was inside like a shot One of
the black boys came softly up at that moment as soon as his sharp eye
spotted the weapon he disappeared as though the earth had swallowed
him

What the mischief are yer goin ter do Peter asked Jimmy

Goin to fetch him said Peter and after carefully emptying his pipe
and replacing it in a leather pouch at his belt he mounted and rode off
at an easy canter

Jimmy watched the horse until it disappeared at the edge of the flat
and then after coiling up the long lash of his bullockwhip in the dust
until it looked like a sleeping snake he prodded the small end of the
long pine handle into the middle of the coil as though driving home a
point and said in a tone of intense conviction

Hell fetch him

 Doc Wild


Peter gradually increased his horses speed along the rough bush track
until he was riding at a good pace It was ten miles to the main road
and five from there to the shanty kept by Black

For some time before Peter started the atmosphere had been very close
and oppressive The great black edge of a stormcloud had risen in the
east and everything indicated the approach of a thunderstorm It was
not long coming Before Peter had completed six miles of his journey
the clouds rolled over obscuring the moon and an Australian
thunderstorm came on with its mighty downpour its blinding lightning
and its earthshaking thunder Peter rode steadily on only pausing now
and then until a flash revealed the track in front of him

Blacks shantyor rather as the sign had it Post Office and General
Storewas as we have said five miles along the main road from the
point where Middletons track joined it The building was of the usual
style of bush architecture About two hundred yards nearer the creek
which crossed the road further on stood a large bark and slab stable
large enough to have met the requirements of a legitimate bush public

The reader may doubt that a sly grog shop could openly carry on
business on a main Government road along which mounted troopers were
continually passing But then you see mounted troopers get thirsty
like other men moreover they could always get their thirst quenched
gratis at these places so the reader will be prepared to hear that
on this very night two troopers horses were stowed snugly away in the
stable and two troopers were stowed snugly away in the back room of the
shanty sleeping off the effects of their cheap but strong potations

There were two rooms of a sort attached to the stablesone at each
end One was occupied by a man who was generally useful and the other
was the surgery office and bedroom pro tem of Doc Wild

Doc Wild was a tall man of spare proportions He had a cadaverous
face black hair bushy black eyebrows eagle nose and eagle eyes He
never slept while he was drinking On this occasion he sat in front of
the fire on a low threelegged stool His knees were drawn up his toes
hooked round the front legs of the stool one hand resting on one knee
and one elbow the hand supporting the chin resting on the other He
was staring intently into the fire on which an old black saucepan
was boiling and sending forth a pungent odour of herbs There seemed
something uncanny about the doctor as the red light of the fire fell on
his hawklike face and gleaming eyes He might have been Mephistopheles
watching some infernal brew

He had sat there some time without stirring a finger when the door
suddenly burst open and Middletons Peter stood within dripping wet
The doctor turned his black piercing eyes upon the intruder who
regarded him silently for a moment and then asked quietly

What the hell do you want

I want you said Peter

And what do you want me for

I want you to come to Joe Middletons wife Shes bad said Peter
calmly

I wont come shouted the doctor Ive brought enough horsestealers
into the world already If any more want to come they can go to blazes
for me Now you get out of this

Dont get yer rag out said Peter quietly The hossstealers come
an nearly killed his mother ter begin with an if yer dont get yer
physicbox an come wi me by the great God Ill

Here the revolver was produced and pointed at Doc Wilds head The
sight of the weapon had a sobering effect upon the doctor He rose
looked at Peter critically for a moment knocked the weapon out of his
hand and said slowly and deliberately

Wall ef the case es as serious as that I hic reckon Id better
come

Peter was still of the same opinion so Doc Wild proceeded to get his
medicine chest ready He explained afterwards in one of his softer
moments that the shooter didnt frighten him so much as it touched his
memorysorter put him in mind of the old days in California and made
him think of the man he might have been hed saykinder touched
his heart and slid the durned old panorama in front of him like a flash
made him think of the time when he slipped three leaden pills into Blue
Shirt for winking at a new chum behind his the Docs back when he
was telling a truthful yarn and charged the said Blue Shirt a hundred
dollars for extracting the said pills

Joe Middletons wife is a grandmother now

Peter passed after the manner of his sort he was found dead in his
bunk

Poor Doc Wild died in a shepherds hut at the Dry Creeks The shepherds
white men found him naked as he was born and with the hide half
burned off him with the sun rounding up imaginary snakes on a dusty
clearing one blazing hot day The hutkeeper had some quare queer
experiences with the doctor during the next three days and used in
after years to tell of them between the puffs of his pipe calmly
and solemnly and as if the story was rather to the doctors credit than
otherwise The shepherds sent for the police and a doctor and sent word
to Joe Middleton Doc Wild was sensible towards the end His interview
with the other doctor was characteristic And now you see how far I
am he said in conclusionhave you brought the brandy The other
doctor had Joe Middleton came with his waggonette and in it the
softest mattress and pillows the station afforded He also in his
innocence brought a dozen of sodawater Doc Wild took Joes hand
feebly and a little later he passed out as he would have said
murmuring something that sounded like poetry in an unknown tongue
Joe took the body to the home station Whos the boss bringin asked
the shearers seeing the waggonette coming very slowly and the boss
walking by the horses heads Doc Wild said a station hand Take
yer hats off

They buried him with bush honours and chiselled his name on a slab of
blueguma wood that lasts




The Mystery of Dave Regan



And then there was Dave Regan said the traveller Dave used to die
oftener than any other bushman I knew He was always being reported
dead and turnin up again He seemed to like itexcept once when his
brother drew his money and drank it all to drown his grief at what he
called Daves untimely end Well Dave went up to Queensland once with
cattle and was away three years and reported dead as usual He was
drowned in the Bogan this time while tryin to swim his horse acrost
a floodand his sweetheart hurried up and got spliced to a worse man
before Dave got back

Well one day I was out in the bush lookin for timber when the
biggest storm ever knowed in that place come on There was hail in it
too as big as bullets and if I hadnt got behind a stump and crouched
down in time Id have been riddled like alike a bushranger As it was
I got soakin wet The storm was over in a few minutes the water run
off down the gullies and the sun come out and the scrub steamedand
stunk like a new pair of moleskin trousers I went on along the track
and presently I seen a long lanky chap get on to a long lanky horse
and ride out of a bush yard at the edge of a clearin I knowed it was
Dave dreckly I set eyes on him

Dave used to ride a tall hollerbacked thoroughbred with a body and
limbs like a kangaroo dog and it would circle around you and sidle away
as if it was frightened you was goin to jab a knife into it

Ello Dave said I as he came spurrin up How are yer

Ello Jim says he How are you

All right says I How are yer gettin on

But before we could say any more that horse shied away and broke off
through the scrub to the right I waited because I knowed Dave would
come back again if I waited long enough and in about ten minutes he
came sidlin in from the scrub to the left

Oh Im all right says he spurrin up sideways How are you

Right says I Hows the old people

Oh I aint been home yet says he holdin out his hand but afore
I could grip it the cussed horse sidled off to the south end of the
clearin and broke away again through the scrub

I heard Dave swearin about the country for twenty minutes or so and
then he came spurrin and cursin in from the other end of the clearin

Where have you been all this time I said as the horse came curvin
up like a boomerang

Gulf country said Dave

That was a storm Dave said I

My oath says Dave

Get caught in it

Yes

Got to shelter

No

But youre as drys a bone Dave

Dave grinned andandthe he yelled

He said that to the horse as it boomeranged off again and broke away
through the scrub I waited but he didnt come back and I reckoned
hed got so far away before he could pull up that he didnt think it
worth while comin back so I went on Byandbye I got thinkin Dave
was as dry as a bone and I knowed that he hadnt had time to get to
shelter for there wasnt a shed within twelve miles He wasnt only
dry but his coat was creased and dusty toosame as if hed been
sleepin in a holler log and when I come to think of it his face
seemed thinner and whiter than it used ter and so did his hands and
wrists which always stuck a long way out of his coatsleeves and there
was blood on his facebut I thought hed got scratched with a twig
Dave used to wear a coat three or four sizes too small for him with
sleeves that didnt come much below his elbows and a tail that scarcely
reached his waist behind And his hair seemed dark and lank instead
of bein sandy and stickin out like an old fibre brush as it used
ter And then I thought his voice sounded different too And when
I enquired next day there was no one heard of Dave and the chaps
reckoned I must have been drunk or seen his ghost

It didnt seem all right at allit worried me a lot I couldnt make
out how Dave kept dry and the horse and saddle and saddlecloth was
wet I told the chaps how he talked to me and what he said and how he
swore at the horse but they only said it was Daves ghost and nobody
elses I told em about him bein dry as a bone after gettin caught in
that storm but they only laughed and said it was a dry place where Dave
went to I talked and argued about it until the chaps began to tap their
foreheads and winkthen I left off talking But I didnt leave off
thinkinI always hated a mystery Even Daves father told me that Dave
couldnt be alive or else his ghost wouldnt be roundhe said he knew
Dave better than that One or two fellers did turn up afterwards that
had seen Dave about the time that I didand then the chaps said they
was sure that Dave was dead

But one fine day as a lot of us chaps was playin pitch and toss at
the shanty one of the fellers yelled out

By Gee Here comes Dave Regan

And I looked up and saw Dave himself sidlin out of a cloud of dust on
a long lanky horse He rode into the stockyard got down hung his horse
up to a post put up the rails and then come slopin towards us with
a halfacre grin on his face Dave had long thin bowlegs and when he
was on the ground he moved as if he was on roller skates

Ello Dave says I How are yer

Ello Jim said he How the blazes are you

All right says I shakin hands How are yer

Oh Im all right he says How are yer poppin up

Well when wed got all that settled and the other chaps had asked how
he was he said Ah well Lets have a drink

And all the other chaps crawfished up and flung themselves round the
corner and sidled into the bar after Dave We had a lot of talk and he
told us that hed been down before but had gone away without seein any
of us except me because hed suddenly heard of a mob of cattle at a
station two hundred miles away and after a while I took him aside and
said

Look here Dave Do you remember the day I met you after the storm

He scratched his head

Why yes he says

Did you get under shelter that day

Whyno

Then how the blazes didnt yer get wet

Dave grinned then he says

Why when I seen the storm coming I took off me clothes and stuck em
in a holler log till the rain was over

Yes he says after the other coves had done laughin but before
Id done thinking I kept my clothes dry and got a good refreshin
showerbath into the bargain

Then he scratched the back of his neck with his little finger and
dropped his jaw and thought a bit then he rubbed the top of his head
and his shoulder reflectivelike and then he said

But I didnt reckon for them there blanky hailstones




Mitchell on Matrimony



I suppose your wife will be glad to see you said Mitchell to his
mate in their camp by the dam at Hungerford They were overhauling their
swags and throwing away the blankets and calico and old clothes and
rubbish they didnt wanteverything in fact except their pocketbooks
and letters and portraits things which men carry about with them
always that are found on them when they die and sent to their
relations if possible Otherwise they are taken in charge by the
constable who officiates at the inquest and forwarded to the Minister
of Justice along with the depositions

It was the end of the shearing season Mitchell and his mate had been
lucky enough to get two good sheds in succession and were going to take
the coach from Hungerford to Bourke on their way to Sydney The morning
stars were bright yet and they sat down to a final billy of tea two
dusty Johnnycakes and a scrag of salt mutton

Yes said Mitchells mate and Ill be glad to see her too

I suppose you will said Mitchell He placed his pintpot between his
feet rested his arm against his knee and stirred the tea meditatively
with the handle of his pocketknife It was vaguely understood that
Mitchell had been married at one period of his chequered career

I dont think we ever understood women properly he said as he took
a cautious sip to see if his tea was cool and sweet enough for his lips
were sore I dont think we ever willwe never took the trouble to
try and if we did it would be only wasted brain power that might just
as well be spent on the blackfellows lingo because by the time youve
learnt it theyll be extinct and woman ll be extinct before youve
learnt her The morning star looks bright doesnt it

Ah well said Mitchell after a while theres many little things
we might try to understand women in I read in a piece of newspaper the
other day about how a man changes after hes married how he gets short
and impatient and bored which is only natural and sticks up a wall
of newspaper between himself and his wife when hes at home and how it
comes like a cold shock to her and all her aircastles vanish and
in the end she often thinks about taking the baby and the clothes she
stands in and going home for sympathy and comfort to mother

Perhaps she never got a word of sympathy from her mother in her life
nor a days comfort at home before she was married but that doesnt
make the slightest difference It doesnt make any difference in your
case either if you havent been acting like a dutiful soninlaw

Somebody wrote that a womans love is her whole existence while a
mans love is only part of hiswhich is true and only natural and
reasonable all things considered But women never consider as a rule A
man cant go on talking loveydovey talk for ever and listening to his
young wifes prattle when hes got to think about making a living and
nursing her and answering her childish questions and telling her he
loves his little ownest every minute in the day while the bills are
running up and rent mornings begin to fly round and hustle and crowd
him

Hes got her and hes satisfied and if the truth is known he loves
her really more than he did when they were engaged only she wont be
satisfied about it unless he tells her so every hour in the day At
least thats how it is for the first few months

But a woman doesnt understand these thingsshe never will she
cantand it would be just as well for us to try and understand that
she doesnt and cant understand them

Mitchell knocked the tealeaves out of his pannikin against his boot
and reached for the billy

Theres many little things we might do that seem mere trifles and
nonsense to us but mean a lot to her that wouldnt be any trouble
or sacrifice to us but might help to make her life happy Its just
because we never think about these little thingsdont think them worth
thinking about in factthey never enter our intellectual foreheads

For instance when youre going out in the morning you might put your
arms round her and give her a hug and a kiss without her having to
remind you You may forget about it and never think any more of itbut
she will

It wouldnt be any trouble to you and would only take a couple of
seconds and would give her something to be happy about when youre
gone and make her sing to herself for hours while she bustles about her
work and thinks up what shell get you for dinner

Mitchells mate sighed and shifted the sugarbag over towards Mitchell
He seemed touched and bothered over something

Then again said Mitchell it mightnt be convenient for you to go
home to dinnersomething might turn up during the morningyou might
have some important business to do or meet some chaps and get invited
to lunch and not be very well able to refuse when its too late or you
havent a chance to send a message to your wife But then again chaps
and business seem very big things to you and only little things to the
wife just as loveydovey talk is important to her and nonsense to you
And when you come to analyse it one is not so big nor the other so
small after all especially when you come to think that chaps can
always wait and business is only an inspiration in your mind nine
cases out of ten

Think of the trouble she takes to get you a good dinner and how she
keeps it hot between two plates in the oven and waits hour after hour
till the dinner gets dried up and all her mornings work is wasted
Think how it hurts her and how anxious shell be especially if youre
inclined to booze for fear that something has happened to you You
cant get it out of the heads of some young wives that youre liable to
get run over or knocked down or assaulted or robbed or get into one
of the fixes that a woman is likely to get into But about the dinner
waiting Try and put yourself in her place Wouldnt you get mad under
the same circumstances I know I would

I remember once only just after I was married I was invited
unexpectedly to a kidney pudding and beanswhich was my favourite grub
at the timeand I didnt resist especially as it was washing day and
I told the wife not to bother about anything for dinner I got home an
hour or so late and had a good explanation thought out when the wife
met me with a smile as if we had just been left a thousand pounds Shed
got her washing finished without assistance though Id told her to get
somebody to help her and she had a kidney pudding and beans with a lot
of extras thrown in as a pleasant surprise for me

Well I kissed her and sat down and stuffed till I thought every
mouthful would choke me I got through with it somehow but Ive never
cared for kidney pudding or beans since

Mitchell felt for his pipe with a fatherly smile in his eyes

And then again he continued as he cut up his tobacco your wife
might put on a new dress and fix herself up and look well and you might
think so and be satisfied with her appearance and be proud to take her
out but you want to tell her so and tell her so as often as you think
about itand try to think a little oftener than men usually do too

     

You should have made a good husband Jack said his mate in a
softened tone

Ah well perhaps I should said Mitchell rubbing up his tobacco
then he asked abstractedly What sort of a husband did you make Joe

I might have made a better one than I did said Joe seriously and
rather bitterly but I know one thing Im going to try and make up for
it when I go back this time

We all say that said Mitchell reflectively filling his pipe She
loves you Joe

I know she does said Joe

Mitchell lit up

And so would any man who knew her or had seen her letters to you he
said between the puffs Shes happy and contented enough I believe

Yes said Joe at least while I was there Shes never easy when Im
away I might have made her a good deal more happy and contented without
hurting myself much

Mitchell smoked long soft measured puffs

His mate shifted uneasily and glanced at him a couple of times and
seemed to become impatient and to make up his mind about something
or perhaps he got an idea that Mitchell had been having him and
felt angry over being betrayed into maudlin confidences for he asked
abruptly

How is your wife now Mitchell

I dont know said Mitchell calmly

Dont know echoed the mate Didnt you treat her well

Mitchell removed his pipe and drew a long breath

Ah well I tried to he said wearily

Well did you put your theory into practice

I did said Mitchell very deliberately

Joe waited but nothing came

Well he asked impatiently How did it act Did it work well

I dont know said Mitchell puff she left me

What

Mitchell jerked the halfsmoked pipe from his mouth and rapped the
burning tobacco out against the toe of his boot

She left me he said standing up and stretching himself Then with a
vicious jerk of his arm She left me foranother kind of a fellow

He looked east towards the publichouse where they were taking the
coachhorses from the stable

Why dont you finish your tea Joe The billys getting cold




Mitchell on Women



All the same said Mitchells mate continuing an argument by the
campfire all the same I think that a woman can stand cold water
better than a man Why when I was staying in a boardinghouse in
Dunedin one very cold winter there was a lady lodger who went down to
the showerbath first thing every morning never missed one sometimes
went in freezing weather when I wouldnt go into a cold bath for a
fiver and sometimes shed stay under the shower for ten minutes at a
time

Howd you know

Why my room was near the bathroom and I could hear the shower and
tap going and her floundering about

Hear your grandmother exclaimed Mitchell contemptuously You dont
know women yet Was this woman married Did she have a husband there

No she was a young widow

Ah well it would have been the same if she was a young girlor an
old one Were there some passable menboarders there

_I_ was there

Oh yes But I mean were there any there beside you

Oh yes there were three or four there wasa clerk and a

Never mind as long as there was something with trousers on Did it
ever strike you that she never got into the bath at all

Why no What would she want to go there at all for in that case

To make an impression on the men replied Mitchell promptly She
wanted to make out she was nice and wholesome and wellwashed
and particular Made an impression on YOU it seems or you wouldnt
remember it

Well yes I suppose so and now I come to think of it the bath
didnt seem to injure her makeup or wet her hair but I supposed she
held her head from under the shower somehow

Did she makeup so early in the morning asked Mitchell

YesIm sure

Thats unusual but it might have been so where there was a lot of
boarders And about the hairthat didnt count for anything because
washingthehead aint supposed to be always included in a ladys bath
its only supposed to be washed once a fortnight and some dont do it
once a month The hair takes so long to dry it dont matter so much if
the womans got short scraggy hair but if a girls hair was down to
her waist it would take hours to dry

Well how do they manage it without wetting their heads

Oh thats easy enough They have a little oilskin cap that fits tight
over the forehead and they put it on and bunch their hair up in it
when they go under the shower Did you ever see a woman sit in a sunny
place with her hair down after having a wash

Yes I used to see one do that regular where I was staying but I
thought she only did it to show off

Not at allshe was drying her hair though perhaps she was showing
off at the same time for she wouldnt sit where youor even a
Chinamancould see her if she didnt think she had a good head of
hair Now ILL tell you a yarn about a womans bath I was stopping
at a shabbygenteel boardinghouse in Melbourne once and one very cold
winter too and there was a rather goodlooking woman there looking
for a husband She used to go down to the bath every morning no matter
how cold it was and flounder and splash about as if she enjoyed it
till youd feel as though youd like to go and catch hold of her and
wrap her in a rug and carry her in to the fire and nurse her till she
was warm again

Mitchells mate moved uneasily and crossed the other leg he seemed
greatly interested

But she never went into the water at all continued Mitchell As soon
as one or two of the men was up in the morning shed come down from her
room in a dressinggown It was a toney dressinggown too and set her
off properly She knew how to dress anyway most of that sort of women
do The gown was a kind of green colour with pink and white flowers
all over it and red lining and a lot of coffeecoloured lace round the
neck and down the front Well shed come tripping downstairs and along
the passage holding up one side of the gown to show her little
bare white foot in a slipper and in the other hand she carried her
toothbrush and bathbrush and soaplike thissos we all could see
em trying to make out she was too particular to use soap after anyone
else She could afford to buy her own soap anyhow it was hardly ever
wet

Well shed go into the bathroom and turn on the tap and shower when
she got about three inches of water in the bath shed step in holding
up her gown out of the water and go slithering and kicking up and down
the bath like this making a tremendous splashing Of course shed turn
off the shower first and screw it off very tightwouldnt do to let
that leak you know she might get wet but shed leave the other tap
on so as to make all the more noise

But how did you come to know all about this

Oh the servant girl told me One morning she twigged her through a
corner of the bathroom window that the curtain didnt cover

You seem to have been pretty thick with servant girls

So do you with landladies But never mindlet me finish the yarn When
she thought shed splashed enough shed get out wipe her feet wash
her face and hands and carefully unbutton the two top buttons of her
gown then throw a towel over her head and shoulders and listen at the
door till she thought she heard some of the men moving about Then
shed start for her room and if she met one of the menboarders in the
passage or on the stairs shed drop her eyes and pretend to see for
the first time that the top of her dressinggown wasnt buttonedand
shed give a little start and grab the gown and scurry off to her room
buttoning it up

And sometimes shed come skipping into the breakfastroom late looking
awfully sweet in her dressinggown and if she saw any of us there
shed pretend to be much startled and say that she thought all the men
had gone out and make as though she was going to clear and someone d
jump up and give her a chair while someone else said Come in Miss
Brown come in Dont let us frighten you Come right in and have
your breakfast before it gets cold So shed flutter a bit in pretty
confusion and then make a sweet little girlygirly dive for her chair
and tuck her feet away under the table and shed blush too but I
dont know how she managed that

I know another trick that women have its mostly played by private
barmaids That is to leave a stocking by accident in the bathroom for
the gentlemen to find If the barmaids got a nice foot and ankle she
uses one of her own stockings but if she hasnt she gets hold of
a stocking that belongs to a girl that has Anyway shell have one
readied up somehow The stocking must be worn and nicely darned one
thats been worn will keep the shape of the leg and footat least
till its washed again Well the barmaid generally knows what time the
gentlemen go to bath and shell make it a point of going down just as
a gentlemans going Of course hell give her the preferencelet her go
first you knowand shell go in and accidentally leave the stocking
in a place where hes sure to see it and when she comes out hell go in
and find it and very likely hell be a jolly sort of fellow and when
theyre all sitting down to breakfast hell come in and ask them to
guess what hes found and then hell hold up the stocking The barmaid
likes this sort of thing but shell hold down her head and pretend
to be confused and keep her eyes on her plate and therell be much
blushing and all that sort of thing and perhaps shell gammon to be
mad at him and the landladyll say Oh Mr Smith how can yer At the
breakfast table too and theyll all laugh and look at the barmaid
and shell get more embarrassed than ever and spill her tea and make
out as though the stocking didnt belong to her




No Place for a Woman



He had a selection on a long boxscrub siding of the ridges about half
a mile back and up from the coach road There were no neighbours that
I ever heard of and the nearest town was thirty miles away He grew
wheat among the stumps of his clearing sold the crop standing to a
Cockie who lived ten miles away and had some surplus sons or some
seasons he reaped it by hand had it thrashed by travelling steamer
portable steam engine and machine and carried the grain a few bags
at a time into the mill on his rickety dray

He had lived alone for upwards of 15 years and was known to those who
knew him as Ratty Howlett

Travlers and strangers failed to see anything uncommonly ratty about
him It was known or at least it was believed without question that
while at work he kept his horse saddled and bridled and hung up to the
fence or grazing about with the saddle onor anyway close handy
for a moments noticeand whenever he caught sight over the scrub and
through the quartermile break in it of a traveller on the road he
would jump on his horse and make after him If it was a horseman
he usually pulled him up inside of a mile Stories were told of
unsuccessful chases misunderstandings and complications arising out of
Howletts mania for running down and bailing up travellers Sometimes he
caught one every day for a week sometimes not one for weeksit was a
lonely track

The explanation was simple sufficient and perfectly naturalfrom a
bushmans point of view Ratty only wanted to have a yarn He and the
traveller would camp in the shade for half an hour or so and yarn and
smoke The old man would find out where the traveller came from and
how long hed been there and where he was making for and how long
he reckoned hed be away and ask if there had been any rain along the
travellers back track and how the country looked after the drought
and hed get the travellers ideas on abstract questionsif he had any
If it was a footman swagman and he was short of tobacco old Howlett
always had half a stick ready for him Sometimes but very rarely hed
invite the swagman back to the hut for a pint of tea or a bit of meat
flour tea or sugar to carry him along the track

And after the yarn by the road they said the old man would ride back
refreshed to his lonely selection and work on into the night as long
as he could see his solitary old plough horse or the scoop of his
longhandled shovel

And so it was that I came to make his acquaintanceor rather that he
made mine I was cantering easily along the trackI was making for the
northwest with a pack horsewhen about a mile beyond the track to the
selection I heard Hi Mister and saw a dust cloud following me I
had heard of Old Ratty Howlett casually and so was prepared for him

A tall gaunt man on a little horse He was cleanshaven except for
a frill beard round under his chin and his long wavy dark hair
was turning grey a square strongfaced man and reminded me of one
fullfaced portrait of Gladstone more than any other face I had seen
He had large reddishbrown eyes deep set under heavy eyebrows and with
something of the blackfellow in themthe sort of eyes that will peer
at something on the horizon that no one else can see He had a way of
talking to the horizon toomore than to his companion and he had a
deep vertical wrinkle in his forehead that no smile could lessen

I got down and got out my pipe and we sat on a log and yarned awhile on
bush subjects and then after a pause he shifted uneasily it seemed
to me and asked rather abruptly and in an altered tone if I was
married A queer question to ask a traveller more especially in my
case as I was little more than a boy then

He talked on again of old things and places where we had both been and
asked after men he knew or had knowndrovers and othersand whether
they were living yet Most of his inquiries went back before my time
but some of the drovers one or two overlanders with whom he had been
mates in his time had grown old into mine and I knew them I notice
now though I didnt thenand if I had it would not have seemed
strange from a bush point of viewthat he didnt ask for news nor seem
interested in it

Then after another uneasy pause during which he scratched crosses in
the dust with a stick he asked me in the same queer tone and without
looking at me or looking up if I happened to know anything about
doctoringif Id ever studied it

I asked him if anyone was sick at his place He hesitated and said
No Then I wanted to know why he had asked me that question and
he was so long about answering that I began to think he was hard of
hearing when at last he muttered something about my face reminding
him of a young fellow he knew of whod gone to Sydney to study for a
doctor That might have been and looked natural enough but why didnt
he ask me straight out if I was the chap he knowed of Travellers do
not like beating about the bush in conversation

He sat in silence for a good while with his arms folded and looking
absently away over the dead level of the great scrubs that spread
from the foot of the ridge we were on to where a blue peak or two of a
distant range showed above the bush on the horizon

I stood up and put my pipe away and stretched Then he seemed to wake
up Better come back to the hut and have a bit of dinner he said
The missus will about have it ready and Ill spare you a handful of
hay for the horses

The hay decided it It was a dry season I was surprised to hear of a
wife for I thought he was a hatterI had always heard so but
perhaps I had been mistaken and he had married lately or had got a
housekeeper The farm was an irregularlyshaped clearing in the scrub
with a good many stumps in it with a brokendown tworail fence
along the frontage and logs and dogleg the rest It was about
as lonelylooking a place as I had seen and I had seen some
outoftheway Godforgotten holes where men lived alone The hut was
in the top corner a tworoomed slab hut with a shingle roof which
must have been uncommon round there in the days when that hut was built
I was used to bush carpentering and saw that the place had been put
up by a man who had plenty of life and hope in front of him and for
someone else beside himself But there were two unfinished skilling
rooms built on to the back of the hut the posts sleepers and
wallplates had been well put up and fitted and the slab walls were
up but the roof had never been put on There was nothing but burrs
and nettles inside those walls and an old wooden bullock plough and a
couple of yokes were dryrotting across the back doorway The remains of
a strawstack some hay under a bark humpy a small iron plough and an
old stiff coffinheaded grey draught horse were all that I saw about
the place

But there was a bit of a surprise for me inside in the shape of a clean
white tablecloth on the rough slab table which stood on stakes driven
into the ground The cloth was coarse but it was a tableclothnot
a spare sheet put on in honour of unexpected visitorsand perfectly
clean The tin plates pannikins and jam tins that served as sugar
bowls and salt cellars were polished brightly The walls and fireplace
were whitewashed the clay floor swept and clean sheets of newspaper
laid on the slab mantleshelf under the row of biscuit tins that held the
groceries I thought that his wife or housekeeper or whatever she was
was a clean and tidy woman about a house I saw no woman but on the
sofaa light wooden batten one with runged arms at the endslay a
womans dress on a lot of sheets of old stained and faded newspapers
He looked at it in a puzzled way knitting his forehead then took it
up absently and folded it I saw then that it was a riding skirt and
jacket He bundled them into the newspapers and took them into the
bedroom

The wife was going on a visit down the creek this afternoon he said
rapidly and without looking at me but stooping as if to have another
look through the door at those distant peaks I suppose she got tired
o waitin and went and took the daughter with her But never mind
the grub is ready There was a campoven with a leg of mutton and
potatoes sizzling in it on the hearth and billies hanging over the
fire I noticed the billies had been scraped and the lids polished

There seemed to be something queer about the whole business but then he
and his wife might have had a breeze during the morning I thought
so during the meal when the subject of women came up and he said one
never knew how to take a woman etc but there was nothing in what he
said that need necessarily have referred to his wife or to any woman in
particular For the rest he talked of old bush things droving digging
and old bushrangingbut never about live things and living men unless
any of the old mates he talked about happened to be alive by accident
He was very restless in the house and never took his hat off

There was a dress and a womans old hat hanging on the wall near the
door but they looked as if they might have been hanging there for a
lifetime There seemed something queer about the whole placesomething
wanting but then all outoftheway bush homes are haunted by that
something wanting or more likely by the spirits of the things that
should have been there but never had been

As I rode down the track to the road I looked back and saw old Howlett
hard at work in a hole round a big stump with his longhandled shovel

Id noticed that he moved and walked with a slight list to port and put
his hand once or twice to the small of his back and I set it down to
lumbago or something of that sort

Up in the Never Never I heard from a drover who had known Howlett that
his wife had died in the first year and so this mysterious woman if
she was his wife was of course his second wife The drover seemed
surprised and rather amused at the thought of old Howlett going in for
matrimony again

     

I rode back that way five years later from the Never Never It was
early in the morningI had ridden since midnight I didnt think the
old man would be up and about and besides I wanted to get on home
and have a look at the old folk and the mates Id left behindand the
girl But I hadnt got far past the point where Howletts track joined
the road when I happened to look back and saw him on horseback
stumbling down the track I waited till he came up

He was riding the old grey draught horse this time and it looked very
much broken down I thought it would have come down every step and
fallen like an old rotten humpy in a gust of wind And the old man was
not much better off I saw at once that he was a very sick man His face
was drawn and he bent forward as if he was hurt He got down stiffly
and awkwardly like a hurt man and as soon as his feet touched the
ground he grabbed my arm or he would have gone down like a man who
steps off a train in motion He hung towards the bank of the road
feeling blindly as it were for the ground with his free hand as I
eased him down I got my blanket and calico from the pack saddle to make
him comfortable

Help me with my back agen the tree he said I must sit upits no
use lyin me down

He sat with his hand gripping his side and breathed painfully

Shall I run up to the hut and get the wife I asked

No He spoke painfully No Then as if the words were jerked out of
him by a spasm She aint there

I took it that she had left him

How long have you been bad How long has this been coming on

He took no notice of the question I thought it was a touch of rheumatic
fever or something of that sort Its gone into my back and sides
nowthe pains worse in me back he said presently

I had once been mates with a man who died suddenly of heart disease
while at work He was washing a dish of dirt in the creek near a claim
we were working he let the dish slip into the water fell back crying
O my back and was gone And now I felt by instinct that it was poor
old Howletts heart that was wrong A mans heart is in his back as well
as in his arms and hands

The old man had turned pale with the pallor of a man who turns faint in
a heat wave and his arms fell loosely and his hands rocked helplessly
with the knuckles in the dust I felt myself turning white too and the
sick cold empty feeling in my stomach for I knew the signs Bushmen
stand in awe of sickness and death

But after Id fixed him comfortably and given him a drink from the water
bag the greyness left his face and he pulled himself together a bit he
drew up his arms and folded them across his chest He let his head rest
back against the treehis slouch hat had fallen off revealing a broad
white brow much higher than I expected He seemed to gaze on the azure
fin of the range showing above the dark bluegreen bush on the horizon

Then he commenced to speaktaking no notice of me when I asked him if
he felt better nowto talk in that strange absent faraway tone that
awes one He told his story mechanically monotonouslyin set words as
I believe now as he had often told it before if not to others then to
the loneliness of the bush And he used the names of people and places
that I had never heard ofjust as if I knew them as well as he did

I didnt want to bring her up the first year It was no place for a
woman I wanted her to stay with her people and wait till Id got the
place a little more shipshape The Phippses took a selection down the
creek I wanted her to wait and come up with them sos shed have some
companya woman to talk to They came afterwards but they didnt stop
It was no place for a woman

But Mary would come She wouldnt stop with her people down country
She wanted to be with me and look after me and work and help me

He repeated himself a great dealsaid the same thing over and over
again sometimes He was only mad on one track Hed tail off and
sit silent for a while then hed become aware of me in a hurried
halfscared way and apologise for putting me to all that trouble and
thank me Ill be all right dreckly Best take the horses up to the
hut and have some breakfast youll find it by the fire Ill foller
you dreckly The wifell be waitin an He would drop off and be
going again presently on the old track

Her mother was coming up to stay awhile at the end of the year but the
old man hurt his leg Then her married sister was coming but one of the
youngsters got sick and there was trouble at home I saw the doctor in
the townthirty miles from hereand fixed it up with him He was a
boozerId a shot him afterwards I fixed up with a woman in the town
to come and stay I thought Mary was wrong in her time She must have
been a month or six weeks out But I listened to her Dont argue
with a woman Dont listen to a woman Do the right thing We should
have had a mother woman to talk to us But it was no place for a woman

He rocked his head as if from some old agony of mind against the
treetrunk

She was took bad suddenly one night but it passed off False alarm I
was going to ride somewhere but she said to wait till daylight Someone
was sure to pass She was a brave and sensible girl but she had a
terror of being left alone It was no place for a woman

There was a black shepherd three or four miles away I rode over while
Mary was asleep and started the black boy into town Id a shot him
afterwards if Id a caught him The old black gin was dead the week
before or Mary would a bin alright She was tied up in a bunch with
strips of blanket and greenhide and put in a hole So there wasnt even
a gin near the place It was no place for a woman

I was watchin the road at daylight and I was watchin the road at
dusk I went down in the hollow and stooped down to get the gap agen the
sky sos I could see if anyone was comin over Id get on the horse
and gallop along towards the town for five miles but something would
drag me back and then Id race for fear shed die before I got to the
hut I expected the doctor every five minutes

It come on about daylight next morning I ran backards and forards
between the hut and the road like a madman And no one come I was
running amongst the logs and stumps and fallin over them when I saw
a cloud of dust agen sunrise It was her mother an sister in the
springcart an just catchin up to them was the doctor in his buggy
with the woman Id arranged with in town The mother and sister was
staying at the town for the night when they heard of the black boy It
took him a day to ride there Id a shot him if Id a caught him ever
after The doctord been on the drunk If Id had the gun and known she
was gone Id have shot him in the buggy They said she was dead And the
child was dead too

They blamed me but I didnt want her to come it was no place for a
woman I never saw them again after the funeral I didnt want to see
them any more

He moved his head wearily against the tree and presently drifted on
again in a softer tonehis eyes and voice were growing more absent and
dreamy and far away

About a month afteror a year I lost count of the time long agoshe
came back to me At first shed come in the night then sometimes when
I was at workand she had the babyit was a girlin her arms And
byandbye she came to stay altogether I didnt blame her for going
away that timeit was no place for a woman She was a good wife to
me She was a jolly girl when I married her The little girl grew up
like her I was going to send her down country to be educatedit was no
place for a girl

But a month or a year ago Mary left me and took the daughter and
never came back till last nightthis morning I think it was I thought
at first it was the girl with her hair done up and her mothers skirt
on to surprise her old dad But it was Mary my wifeas she was when
I married her She said she couldnt stay but shed wait for me on the
road onthe road

His arms fell and his face went white I got the waterbag Another
turn like that and youll be gone I thought as he came to again Then
I suddenly thought of a shanty that had been started when I came that
way last ten or twelve miles along the road towards the town There
was nothing for it but to leave him and ride on for help and a cart of
some kind

You wait here till I come back I said Im going for the doctor

He roused himself a little Best come up to the hut and get some grub
The wifell be waiting He was off the track again

Will you wait while I take the horse down to the creek

YesIll wait by the road

Look I said Ill leave the waterbag handy Dont move till I come
back

I wont moveIll wait by the road he said

I took the packhorse which was the freshest and best threw the
packsaddle and bags into a bush left the other horse to take care of
itself and started for the shanty leaving the old man with his back to
the tree his arms folded and his eyes on the horizon

One of the chaps at the shanty rode on for the doctor at once while the
other came back with me in a springcart He told me that old Howletts
wife had died in childbirth the first year on the selectionshe was a
fine girl hed heered He told me the story as the old man had told it
and in pretty well the same words even to giving it as his opinion that
it was no place for a woman And he hatted and brooded over it till
he went ratty

I knew the rest He not only thought that his wife or the ghost of his
wife had been with him all those years but that the child had lived
and grown up and that the wife did the housework which of course he
must have done himself

When we reached him his knotted hands had fallen for the last time and
they were at rest I only took one quick look at his face but could
have sworn that he was gazing at the blue fin of the range on the
horizon of the bush

Up at the hut the table was set as on the first day I saw it and
breakfast in the campoven by the fire




Mitchells Jobs



Im going to knock off work and try to make some money said Mitchell
as he jerked the tealeaves out of his pannikin and reached for the
billy Its been the great mistake of my lifeif I hadnt wasted all
my time and energy working and looking for work I might have been an
independent man today

Joe he added in a louder voice condescendingly adapting his language
to my bushed comprehension Im going to sling graft and try and get
some stuff together

I didnt feel in a responsive humour but I lit up and settled back
comfortably against the tree and Jack folded his arms on his knees and
presently continued reflectively

I remember the first time I went to work I was a youngster then
Mother used to go round looking for jobs for me She reckoned perhaps
that I was too shy to go in where there was a boy wanted and barrack for
myself properly and she used to help me and see me through to the best
of her ability Im afraid I didnt always feel as grateful to her as I
should have felt I was a thankless kid at the best of timesmost kids
arebut otherwise I was a straight enough little chap as nippers go
Sometimes I almost wish I hadnt been My relations would have thought
a good deal more of me and treated me betterand besides its a
comfort at times to sit and watch the sun going down in the bed of the
bush and think of your wicked childhood and wasted life and the way
you treated your parents and broke their hearts and feel just properly
repentant and bitter and remorseful and lowspirited about it when its
too late

Ah well I generally did feel a bit backward in going in when I
came to the door of an office or shop where there was a Strong Lad or
a Willing Youth wanted inside to make himself generally useful I
was a strong lad and a willing youth enough in some things for that
matter but I didnt like to see it written up on a card in a shop
window and I didnt want to make myself generally useful in a close
shop in a hot dusty street on mornings when the weather was fine and the
great sunny rollers were coming in grand on the Bondi Beach and down at
Coogee and I could swim Id give something to be down along there
now

Mitchell looked away out over the sultry sandy plain that we were to
tackle next day and sighed

The first job I got was in a jam factory They only had Boy Wanted on
the card in the window and I thought it would suit me They set me to
work to peel peaches and as soon as the foremans back was turned
I picked out a likelylooking peach and tried it They soaked those
peaches in salt or acid or somethingit was part of the processand
I had to spit it out Then I got an orange from a boy who was slicing
them but it was bitter and I couldnt eat it I saw that Id been had
properly I was in a fix and had to get out of it the best way I could
Id left my coat down in the front shop and the foreman and boss were
there so I had to work in that place for two mortal hours It was about
the longest two hours Id ever spent in my life At last the foreman
came up and I told him I wanted to go down to the back for a minute I
slipped down watched my chance till the boss back was turned got my
coat and cleared

The next job I got was in a mat factory at least Aunt got that for
me I didnt want to have anything to do with mats or carpets The worst
of it was the boss didnt seem to want me to go and I had a job to get
him to sack me and when he did he saw some of my people and took me
back again next week He sacked me finally the next Saturday

I got the next job myself I didnt hurry I took my time and picked
out a good one It was in a lolly factory I thought it would suit
meand it did for a while They put me on stirring up and mixing stuff
in the jujube department but I got so sick of the smell of it and so
full of jujube and other lollies that I soon wanted a change so I had
a row with the chief of the jujube department and the boss gave me the
sack

I got a job in a grocery then I thought Id have more variety there
But one day the boss was away sick or something all the afternoon and
I sold a lot of things too cheap I didnt know When a customer came in
and asked for something Id just look round in the window till I saw
a card with the price written up on it and sell the best quality
according to that price and once or twice I made a mistake the other
way about and lost a couple of good customers It was a hot drowsy
afternoon and byandbye I began to feel dull and sleepy So I looked
round the corner and saw a Chinaman coming I got a big tin garden
syringe and filled it full of brine from the butter keg and when he
came opposite the door I let him have the full force of it in the ear

That Chinaman put down his baskets and came for me I was strong for my
age and thought I could fight but he gave me a proper mauling

It was like running up against a thrashing machine and it wouldnt
have been well for me if the boss of the shop next door hadnt
interfered He told my boss and my boss gave me the sack at once

I took a spell of eighteen months or so after that and was growing
up happy and contented when a married sister of mine must needs come
to live in town and interfere I didnt like married sisters though I
always got on grand with my brothersinlaw and wished there were more
of them The married sister comes round and cleans up the place and
pulls your things about and finds your pipe and tobacco and things and
cigarette portraits and Deadwood Dicks that youve got put away all
right sos your mother and aunt wouldnt find them in a generation of
cats and says

Mother why dont you make that boy go to work Its a scandalous
shame to see a big boy like that growing up idle Hes going to the bad
before your eyes And shes always trying to make out that youre a
liar and trying to make mother believe it too My married sister got
me a job with a chemist whose missus she knew

I got on pretty well there and byandbye I was put upstairs in the
grinding and mixing department but after a while they put another
boy that I was chummy with up there with me and that was a mistake
I didnt think so at the time but I can see it now We got up to all
sorts of tricks Wed get mixing together chemicals that werent related
to see how theyd agree and we nearly blew up the shop several times
and set it on fire once But all the chaps liked us and fixed things up
for us One day we got a big black dogthat we meant to take home that
eveningand sneaked him upstairs and put him on a flat roof outside the
laboratory He had a touch of the mange and didnt look well so we gave
him a dose of something and he scrambled over the parapet and slipped
down a steep iron roof in front and fell on a respected townsman that
knew my people We were awfully frightened and didnt say anything
Nobody saw it but us The dog had the presence of mind to leave at once
and the respected townsman was picked up and taken home in a cab and
he got it hot from his wife too I believe for being in that drunken
beastly state in the main street in the middle of the day

I dont think he was ever quite sure that he hadnt been drunk or
what had happened for he had had one or two that morning so it didnt
matter much Only we lost the dog

One day I went downstairs to the packingroom and saw a lot of
phosphorus in jars of water I wanted to fix up a ghost for Billy my
mate so I nicked a bit and slipped it into my trouser pocket

I stood under the tap and let it pour on me The phosphorus burnt clean
through my pocket and fell on the ground I was sent home that night
with my leg dressed with limewater and oil and a pair of the bosss
pants on that were about half a yard too long for me and I felt
miserable enough too They said it would stop my tricks for a while
and so it did Ill carry the mark to my dying dayand for two or three
days after for that matter

     

I fell asleep at this point and left Mitchells cattle pup to hear it
out




Bill the Ventriloquial Rooster



When we were up country on the selection we had a rooster at our
place named Bill said Mitchell a big mongrel of no particular
breed though the old lady said he was a brammerand many an argument
she had with the old man about it too she was just as stubborn and
obstinate in her opinion as the governor was in his But anyway we
called him Bill and didnt take any particular notice of him till a
cousin of some of us came from Sydney on a visit to the country and
stayed at our place because it was cheaper than stopping at a pub Well
somehow this chap got interested in Bill and studied him for two or
three days and at last he says

Why that roosters a ventriloquist

A what

A ventriloquist

Go along with yer

But he is Ive heard of cases like this before but this is the first
Ive come across Bills a ventriloquist right enough

Then we remembered that there wasnt another rooster within five
milesour only neighbour an Irishman named Page didnt have one at
the timeand wed often heard another cock crow but didnt think
to take any notice of it We watched Bill and sure enough he WAS
a ventriloquist The kacocka would come all right but the
cokakoooioo seemed to come from a distance And sometimes the
whole crow would go wrong and come back like an echo that had been lost
for a year Bill would stand on tiptoe and hold his elbows out and
curve his neck and go two or three times as if he was swallowing
nesteggs and nearly break his neck and burst his gizzard and then
thered be no sound at all where he wasonly a cock crowing in the
distance

And pretty soon we could see that Bill was in great trouble about it
himself You see he didnt know it was himselfthought it was another
rooster challenging him and he wanted badly to find that other bird
He would get up on the woodheap and crow and listencrow and listen
againcrow and listen and then hed go up to the top of the paddock
and get up on the stack and crow and listen there Then down to the
other end of the paddock and get up on a mullockheap and crow and
listen there Then across to the other side and up on a log among the
saplings and crow n listen some more He searched all over the place
for that other rooster but of course couldnt find him Sometimes
hed be out all day crowing and listening all over the country and then
come home dead tired and rest and cool off in a hole that the hens had
scratched for him in a damp place under the watercask sledge

Well one day Page brought home a big white rooster and when he let
it go it climbed up on Pages stack and crowed to see if there was any
more roosters round there Bill had come home tired it was a hot day
and hed rooted out the hens and was having a spelloh under the cask
when the white rooster crowed Bill didnt lose any time getting out and
on to the woodheap and then he waited till he heard the crow again
then he crowed and the other rooster crowed again and they crowed at
each other for three days and called each other all the wretches they
could lay their tongues to and after that they implored each other
to come out and be made into chicken soup and feather pillows But
neitherd come You see there were THREE crowsthere was Bills crow
and the ventriloquist crow and the white roosters crowand each
rooster thought that there was TWO roosters in the opposition camp and
that he mightnt get fair play and consequently both were afraid to
put up their hands

But at last Bill couldnt stand it any longer He made up his mind to
go and have it out even if there was a whole agricultural show of prize
and honourablemention fightingcocks in Pages yard He got down from
the woodheap and started off across the ploughed field his head down
his elbows out and his thick awkward legs prodding away at the furrows
behind for all they were worth

I wanted to go down badly and see the fight and barrack for Bill But
I darent because Id been coming up the road late the night before
with my brother Joe and there was about three panels of turkeys
roosting along on the top rail of Pages front fence and we brushed em
with a bough and they got up such a blessed gobbling fuss about it that
Page came out in his shirt and saw us running away and I knew he was
laying for us with a bullock whip Besides there was friction between
the two families on account of a thoroughbred bull that Page borrowed
and wouldnt lend to us and that got into our paddock on account of me
mending a panel in the party fence and carelessly leaving the top
rail down after sundown while our cows was moving round there in the
saplings

So there was too much friction for me to go down but I climbed a tree
as near the fence as I could and watched Bill reckoned hed found that
rooster at last The white rooster wouldnt come down from the stack
so Bill went up to him and they fought there till they tumbled down the
other side and I couldnt see any more Wasnt I wild Id have given
my dog to have seen the rest of the fight I went down to the far side
of Pages fence and climbed a tree there but of course I couldnt
see anything so I came home the back way Just as I got home Page came
round to the front and sung out Insoid there And me and Jim went
under the house like snakes and looked out round a pile But Page was
all righthe had a broad grin on his face and Bill safe under his arm
He put Bill down on the ground very carefully and says he to the old
folks

Yer rooster knocked the stuffin out of my rooster but I bear no
malice Twas a grand foight

And then the old man and Page had a yarn and got pretty friendly after
that And Bill didnt seem to bother about any more ventriloquism but
the white rooster spent a lot of time looking for that other rooster
Perhaps he thought hed have better luck with him But Page was on the
lookout all the time to get a rooster that would lick ours He did
nothing else for a month but ride round and enquire about roosters and
at last he borrowed a gamebird in town left five pounds deposit on
him and brought him home And Page and the old man agreed to have a
matchabout the only thing theyd agreed about for five years And they
fixed it up for a Sunday when the old lady and the girls and kids were
going on a visit to some relations about fifteen miles awayto stop
all night The guvnor made me go with them on horseback but I knew
what was up and so my pony went lame about a mile along the road and
I had to come back and turn him out in the top paddock and hide the
saddle and bridle in a hollow log and sneak home and climb up on the
roof of the shed It was a awful hot day and I had to keep climbing
backward and forward over the ridgepole all the morning to keep out of
sight of the old man for he was moving about a good deal

Well after dinner the fellows from roundabout began to ride in and
hang up their horses round the place till it looked as if there was
going to be a funeral Some of the chaps saw me of course but I tipped
them the wink and they gave me the office whenever the old man happened
around

Well Page came along with his gamerooster Its name was Jim It
wasnt much to look at and it seemed a good deal smaller and weaker
than Bill Some of the chaps were disgusted and said it wasnt a
gamerooster at all Billd settle it in one lick and they wouldnt
have any fun

Well they brought the game one out and put him down near the
woodheap and rousted Bill out from under his cask He got interested
at once He looked at Jim and got up on the woodheap and crowed and
looked at Jim again He reckoned THIS at last was the fowl that had been
humbugging him all along Presently his trouble caught him and then
hed crow and take a squint at the game un and crow again and
have another squint at gamey and try to crow and keep his eye on the
gamerooster at the same time But Jim never committed himself until
at last he happened to gape just after Bills whole crow went wrong and
Bill spotted him He reckoned hed caught him this time and he got down
off that woodheap and went for the foe But Jim ran awayand Bill ran
after him

Round and round the woodheap they went and round the shed and round
the house and under it and back again and round the woodheap and over
it and round the other way and kept it up for close on an hour Bills
bill was just within an inch or so of the gameroosters tail feathers
most of the time but he couldnt get any nearer do how he liked And
all the time the fellers kept chyackin Page and singing out What price
yer game un Page Go it Bill Go it old cock and all that sort of
thing Well the gamerooster went as if it was a goasyouplease and
he didnt care if it lasted a year He didnt seem to take any interest
in the business but Bill got excited and byandby he got mad He held
his head lower and lower and his wings further and further out from his
sides and prodded away harder and harder at the ground behind but it
wasnt any use Jim seemed to keep ahead without trying They stuck
to the woodheap towards the last They went round first one way for a
while and then the other for a change and now and then theyd go over
the top to break the monotony and the chaps got more interested in the
race than they would have been in the fightand bet on it too But
Bill was handicapped with his weight He was done up at last he slowed
down till he couldnt waddle and then when he was thoroughly knocked
up that gamerooster turned on him and gave him the father of a
hiding

And my father caught me when Id got down in the excitement and wasnt
thinking and HE gave ME the stepfather of a hiding But he had a
lively time with the old lady afterwards over the cockfight

Bill was so disgusted with himself that he went under the cask and
died




Bush Cats



Domestic cats we meanthe descendants of cats who came from the
northern world during the last hundred odd years We do not know the
name of the vessel in which the first Thomas and his Maria came out
to Australia but we suppose that it was one of the ships of the
First Fleet Most likely Maria had kittens on the voyagetwo lots
perhapsthe majority of which were buried at sea and no doubt the
disembarkation caused her much maternal anxiety

     

The feline race has not altered much in Australia from a physical point
of viewnot yet The rabbit has developed into something like a cross
between a kangaroo and a possum but the bush has not begun to develop
the common cat She is just as sedate and motherly as the mummy cats
of Egypt were but she takes longer strolls of nights climbs gumtrees
instead of roofs and hunts stranger vermin than ever came under the
observation of her northern ancestors Her views have widened She is
mostly thinner than the English farm catwhich is they say on account
of eating lizards

English rats and English micewe say English because everything which
isnt Australian in Australia IS English or BritishEnglish rats and
English mice are either rare or nonexistent in the bush but the hut
cat has a wider range for game She is always dragging in things which
are unknown in the halls of zoology ugly loathsome crawling abortions
which have not been classified yetand perhaps could not be

The Australian zoologist ought to rake up some more dead languages and
then go Out Back with a few bush cats

The Australian bush cat has a nasty unpleasant habit of dragging
a long wriggling horrid black snakeshe seems to prefer black
snakesinto a room where there are ladies proudly laying it down in
a conspicuous place usually in front of the exit and then looking up
for approbation She wonders perhaps why the visitors are in such a
hurry to leave

Pussy doesnt approve of live snakes round the place especially if
she has kittens and if she finds a snake in the vicinity of her
progenywell it is bad for that particular serpent

This brings recollections of a neighbours cat who went out in the
scrub one midsummers day and found a brown snake Her namethe cats
namewas Mary Ann She got hold of the snake all right just within an
inch of its head but it got the rest of its length wound round her body
and squeezed about eight lives out of her She had the presence of mind
to keep her hold but it struck her that she was in a fix and that if
she wanted to save her ninth life it wouldnt be a bad idea to go home
for help So she started home snake and all

The family were at dinner when Mary Ann came in and although she
stood on an open part of the floor no one noticed her for a while She
couldnt ask for help for her mouth was too full of snake Byandbye
one of the girls glanced round and then went over the table with a
shriek and out of the back door The room was cleared very quickly The
eldest boy got a longhandled shovel and in another second would have
killed more cat than snake but his father interfered The father was
a shearer and Mary Ann was a favourite cat with him He got a pair of
shears from the shelf and deftly shore off the snakes head and one
side of Mary Anns whiskers She didnt think it safe to let go yet She
kept her teeth in the neck until the selector snipped the rest of the
snake off her The bits were carried out on a shovel to die at sundown
Mary Ann had a good drink of milk and then got her tongue out and
licked herself back into the proper shape for a cat after which she
went out to look for that snakes mate She found it too and dragged
it home the same evening

Cats will kill rabbits and drag them home We knew a fossicker whose cat
used to bring him a bunny nearly every night The fossicker had rabbits
for breakfast until he got sick of them and then he used to swap them
with a butcher for meat The cat was named Ingersoll which indicates
his sex and gives an inkling to his masters religious and political
opinions Ingersoll used to prospect round in the gloaming until he
found some rabbit holes which showed encouraging indications He would
shepherd one hole for an hour or so every evening until he found it was
a duffer or worked it out then he would shift to another One day he
prospected a big hollow log with a lot of holes in it and more going
down underneath The indications were very good but Ingersoll had no
luck The game had too many ways of getting out and in He found that he
could not work that claim by himself so he floated it into a company
He persuaded several cats from a neighbouring selection to take shares
and they watched the holes together or in turnsthey worked shifts
The dividends more than realised even their wildest expectations for
each cat took home at least one rabbit every night for a week

A selector started a vegetable garden about the time when rabbits were
beginning to get troublesome up country The hare had not shown itself
yet The farmer kept quite a regiment of cats to protect his gardenand
they protected it He would shut the cats up all day with nothing to
eat and let them out about sundown then they would mooch off to the
turnip patch like farmlabourers going to work They would drag the
rabbits home to the back door and sit there and watch them until the
farmer opened the door and served out the ration of milk Then the cats
would turn in He nearly always found a semicircle of dead rabbits and
watchful cats round the door in the morning They sold the product of
their labour direct to the farmer for milk It didnt matter if one cat
had been unluckyhad not got a rabbiteach had an equal share in the
general result They were true socialists those cats

One of those cats was a mighty big Tom named Jack He was death on
rabbits he would work hard all night laying for them and dragging them
home Some weeks he would graft every night and at other times every
other night but he was generally pretty regular When he reckoned he
had done an extra nights work he would take the next night off and go
three miles to the nearest neighbours to see his Maria and take her out
for a stroll Well one evening Jack went into the garden and chose a
place where there was good cover and lay low He was a bit earlier than
usual so he thought he would have a doze till rabbit time Byandbye
he heard a noise and slowly cautiously opening one eye he saw two big
ears sticking out of the leaves in front of him He judged that it was
an extra big bunny so he put some extra style into his manoeuvres In
about five minutes he made his spring He must have thought if cats
think that it was a whopping oldman rabbit for it was a pioneer
harenot an ordinary English hare but one of those great coarse lanky
things which the bush is breeding The selector was attracted by an
unusual commotion and a cloud of dust among his cabbages and came along
with his gun in time to witness the fight First Jack would drag the
hare and then the hare would drag Jack sometimes they would be down
together and then Jack would use his hind claws with effect finally he
got his teeth in the right place and triumphed Then he started to drag
the corpse home but he had to give it best and ask his master to lend a
hand The selector took up the hare and Jack followed home much to
the familys surprise He did not go back to work that night he took
a spell He had a drink of milk licked the dust off himself washed it
down with another drink and sat in front of the fire and thought for a
goodish while Then he got up walked over to the corner where the hare
was lying had a good look at it came back to the fire sat down again
and thought hard He was still thinking when the family retired




Meeting Old Mates



 I

 Tom Smith


You are getting well on in the thirties and havent left off being a
fool yet You have been away in another colony or country for a year or
so and have now come back again Most of your chums have gone away or
got married or worse still signed the pledgesettled down and got
steady and you feel lonely and desolate and leftbehind enough for
anything While drifting aimlessly round town with an eye out for some
chance acquaintance to have a knock round with you run against an old
chum whom you never dreamt of meeting or whom you thought to be in some
other part of the countryor perhaps you knock up against someone who
knows the old chum in question and he says

I suppose you know Tom Smiths in Sydney

Tom Smith Why I thought he was in Queensland I havent seen him for
more than three years Wheres the old joker hanging out at all Why
except you theres no one in Australia Id sooner see than Tom Smith
Here Ive been mooning round like an unemployed for three weeks looking
for someone to have a knock round with and Tom in Sydney all the time
I wish Id known before Wherell I run against himwhere does he
live

Oh hes living at home

But wheres his home I was never there

Oh Ill give you his address There I think thats it Im not
sure about the number but youll soon find out in that streetmost of
emll know Tom Smith

Thanks I rather think they will Im glad I met you Ill hunt Tom up
today

So you put a few shillings in your pocket tell your landlady that
youre going to visit an old aunt of yours or a sick friend and maynt
be home that night and then you start out to hunt up Tom Smith and have
at least one more good night if you die for it

     

This is the first time you have seen Tom at home you knew of his home
and people in the old days but only in a vague indefinite sort of way
Tom has changed He is stouter and olderlooking he seems solemn and
settled down You intended to give him a surprise and have a good old
jolly laugh with him but somehow things get suddenly damped at the
beginning He grins and grips your hand right enough but there seems
something wanting You cant help staring at him and he seems to look
at you in a strange disappointing way it doesnt strike you that you
also have changed and perhaps more in his eyes than he in yours He
introduces you to his mother and sisters and brothers and the rest of
the family or to his wife as the case may be and you have to suppress
your feelings and be polite and talk commonplace You hate to be polite
and talk commonplace You arent built that wayand Tom wasnt either
in the old days The wife or the mother and sisters receives you
kindly for Toms sake and makes much of you but they dont know you
yet You want to get Tom outside and have a yarn and a drink and a
laugh with himyou are bursting to tell him all about yourself and get
him to tell you all about himself and ask him if he remembers things
and you wonder if he is bursting the same way and hope he is The old
lady and sisters or the wife bore you pretty soon and you wonder
if they bore Tom you almost fancy from his looks that they do You
wonder whether Tom is coming out tonight whether he wants to get out
and if he wants to and wants to get out by himself whether hell be
able to manage it but you darent broach the subject it wouldnt be
polite Youve got to be polite Then you get worried by the thought
that Tom is bursting to get out with you and only wants an excuse is
waiting in fact and hoping for you to ask him in an offhand sort of
way to come out for a stroll But youre not quite sure and besides if
you were you wouldnt have the courage Byandbye you get tired of
it all thirsty and want to get out in the open air You get tired of
saying Do you really Mrs Smith or Do you think so Miss Smith
or You were quite right Mrs Smith and Well I think so too Mrs
Smith or to the brother Thats just what I thought Mr Smith
You dont want to talk pretty to them and listen to their wishywashy
nonsense you want to get out and have a roaring spree with Tom as you
had in the old days you want to make another night of it with your
old mate Tom Smith and pretty soon you get the blues badly and feel
nearly smothered in there and youve got to get out and have a beer
anywayTom or no Tom and you begin to feel wild with Tom himself and
at last you make a bold dash for it and chance Tom You get up look
at your hat and say Ah well I must be going Tom Ive got to meet
someone down the street at seven oclock Wherell I meet you in town
next week

But Tom says

Oh dash it you aint going yet Stay to tea Joe stay to tea Itll
be on the table in a minute Sit downsit down man Here gimme your
hat

And Toms sister or wife or mother comes in with an apron on and her
hands all over flour and says

Oh youre not going yet Mr Brown Teall be ready in a minute Do
stay for tea And if you make excuses she crossexamines you about the
time youve got to keep that appointment down the street and tells you
that their clock is twenty minutes fast and that you have got plenty of
time and so you have to give in But you are mightily encouraged by
a winksome expression which you see or fancy you see on your side of
Toms face also by the fact of his having accidentally knocked his foot
against your shins So you stay

One of the females tells you to Sit there Mr Brown and you take
your place at the table and the polite business goes on Youve got to
hold your knife and fork properly and mind your ps and qs and when
she says Do you take milk and sugar Mr Brown youve got to say
Yes please Miss Smiththanksthats plenty And when they press
you as they will to have more youve got to keep on saying No
thanks Mrs Smith no thanks Miss Smith I really couldnt Ive done
very well thank you I had a very late dinner and so onbother such
tommyrot And you dont seem to have any appetite anyway And you
think of the days out on the track when you and Tom sat on your
swags under a mulga at midday and ate mutton and johnnycake with
claspknives and drank by turns out of the old battered leaky billy

And after tea you have to sit still while the precious minutes are
wasted and listen and sympathize while all the time you are on the
fidget to get out with Tom and go down to a private bar where you know
some girls

And perhaps byandbye the old lady gets confidential and seizes an
opportunity to tell you what a good steady young fellow Tom is now that
he never touches drink and belongs to a temperance society or the
YMCA and never stays out of nights

Consequently you feel worse than ever and lonelier and sorrier that
you wasted your time coming You are encouraged again by a glimpse of
Tom putting on a clean collar and fixing himself up a bit but when you
are ready to go and ask him if hes coming a bit down the street
with you he says he thinks he will in such a disinterested
dontmindifIdo sort of tone that he makes you mad

At last after promising to drop in again Mr Brown whenever youre
passing and to dont forget to call and thanking them for their
assurance that theyll be always glad to see you and telling them
that youve spent a very pleasant evening and enjoyed yourself and are
awfully sorry you couldnt stayyou get away with Tom

You dont say much to each other till you get round the corner and
down the street a bit and then for a while your conversation is mostly
commonplace such as Well how have you been getting on all this
time Tom Oh all right How have you been getting on and so on

But presently and perhaps just as you have made up your mind to chance
the alleged temperance business and ask Tom in to have a drink he
throws a glance up and down the street nudges your shoulder says Come
on and disappears sideways into a pub

     

Whats yours Tom Whats yours Joe The same for me Well
heres luck old man Heres luck You take a drink and look over
your glass at Tom Then the old smile spreads over his face and it
makes you gladyou could swear to Toms grin in a hundred years Then
something tickles himyour expression perhaps or a recollection of
the pastand he sets down his glass on the bar and laughs Then you
laugh Oh theres no smile like the smile that old mates favour each
other with over the tops of their glasses when they meet again after
years It is eloquent because of the memories that give it birth

Heres another Do you remember Do you remember Oh it all
comes back again like a flash Tom hasnt changed a bit just the same
goodhearted jolly idiot he always was Old times back again Its
just like old times says Tom after three or four more drinks

     

And so you make a night of it and get uproariously jolly You get as
glorious as Bobby Burns did in the part of Tam OShanter and have a
better time than any of the times you had in the old days And you see
Tom as nearly home in the morning as you dare and he reckons hell get
it hot from his peoplewhich no doubt he willand he explains that
they are very particular up at homechurch people you knowand of
course especially if hes married its understood between you that
youd better not call for him up at home after thisat least not till
things have cooled down a bit Its always the way The friend of the
husband always gets the blame in cases like this But Tom fixes up a
yarn to tell them and you arent to say anything different in case
you run against any of them And he fixes up an appointment with you for
next Saturday night and hell get there if he gets divorced for it
But he MIGHT have to take the wife out shopping or one of the girls
somewhere and if you see her with him youve got to lay low and be
careful and waitat another hour and place perhaps all of which is
arrangedfor if she sees you shell smell a rat at once and he wont
be able to get off at all

And so as far as you and Tom are concerned the old times have come
back once more

     

But of course and we almost forgot it you might chance to fall in
love with one of Toms sisters in which case there would be another and
a totally different story to tell



 II

 Jack Ellis


Things are going well with you You have escaped from the track so to
speak and are in a snug comfortable little billet in the city Well
while doing the block you run against an old mate of other daysVERY
other dayscall him Jack Ellis Things have gone hard with Jack He
knows you at once but makes no advance towards a greeting he acts as
though he thinks you might cut himwhich of course if you are a true
mate you have not the slightest intention of doing His coat is yellow
and frayed his hat is battered and green his trousers gone in
various places his linen very cloudy and his boots burst and innocent
of polish You try not to notice these thingsor rather not to seem
to notice thembut you cannot help doing so and you are afraid hell
notice that you see these things and put a wrong construction on it
How men will misunderstand each other You greet him with more than the
necessary enthusiasm In your anxiety to set him at his ease and make
him believe that nothingnot even moneycan make a difference in your
friendship you overact the business and presently you are afraid that
hell notice that too and put a wrong construction on it You wish that
your collar was not so clean nor your clothes so new Had you known you
would meet him you would have put on some old clothes for the occasion

You are both embarrassed but it is YOU who feel ashamedyou are
almost afraid to look at him lest hell think you are looking at his
shabbiness You ask him in to have a drink but he doesnt respond
so heartily as you wish as he did in the old days he doesnt like
drinking with anybody when he isnt fixed as he calls itwhen he
cant shout

It didnt matter in the old days who held the money so long as there was
plenty of stuff in the camp You think of the days when Jack stuck to
you through thick and thin You would like to give him money now but
he is so proud he always was he makes you mad with his beastly pride
There wasnt any pride of that sort on the track or in the camp in
those days but times have changedyour lives have drifted too widely
apartyou have taken different tracks since then and Jack without
intending to makes you feel that it is so

You have a drink but it isnt a success it falls flat as far as Jack
is concerned he wont have another he doesnt feel on and presently
he escapes under plea of an engagement and promises to see you again

And you wish that the time was come when no one could have more or less
to spend than another

     

PSI met an old mate of that description once and so successfully
persuaded him out of his beastly pride that he borrowed two pounds off
me till Monday I never got it back since and I want it badly at
the present time In future Ill leave old mates with their pride
unimpaired




Two Larrikins



Yorter do something Ernie Yer know how I am YOU dont seem to care
Yorter to do something

Stowsher slouched at a greater angle to the greasy doorpost and
scowled under his hatbrim It was a little low frowsy room opening
into Jones Alley She sat at the table sewinga thin sallow girl
with weak colourless eyes She looked as frowsy as her surroundings

Well why dont you go to some of them women and get fixed up

She flicked the end of the tablecloth over some tiny unfinished
articles of clothing and bent to her work

But you know very well I havent got a shilling Ernie she said
quietly Where am I to get the money from

Who asked yer to get it

She was silent with the exasperating silence of a woman who has
determined to do a thing in spite of all reasons and arguments that may
be brought against it

Well wot more do yer want demanded Stowsher impatiently

She bent lower Couldnt we keep it Ernie

Wot next asked Stowsher sulkilyhe had half suspected what was
coming Then with an impatient oath You must be gettin ratty

She brushed the corner of the cloth further over the little clothes

It wouldnt cost anything Ernie Id take a pride in him and keep him
clean and dress him like a little lord Hell be different from all the
other youngsters He wouldnt be like those dirty sickly little brats
out there Hed be just like you Ernie I know he would Ill look
after him night and day and bring him up well and strong Wed train
his little muscles from the first Ernie and hed be able to knock em
all out when he grew up It wouldnt cost much and Id work hard and be
careful if youd help me And youd be proud of him too ErnieI know
you would

Stowsher scraped the doorstep with his foot but whether he was
touched or feared hysterics and was wisely silent was not apparent

Do you remember the first day I met you Ernie she asked presently

Stowsher regarded her with an uneasy scowl Wellwot o that

You came into the barparlour at the Cricketers Arms and caught a
push of em chyacking your old man

Well I altered that

I know you did You done for three of them one after another and two
was bigger than you

Yes and when the push come up we done for the rest said Stowsher
softening at the recollection

And the day you come home and caught the landlord bullying your old
mother like a dog

Yes I got three months for that job But it was worth it he
reflected Only he added the old woman might have had the knocker
to keep away from the lush while I was in quod But wots all this
got to do with it

HE might barrack and fight for you some day Ernie she said softly
when youre old and out of form and aint got no push to back you

The thing was becoming decidedly embarrassing to Stowsher not that he
felt any delicacy on the subject but because he hated to be drawn into
a conversation that might be considered soft

Oh stow that he said comfortingly Git on yer hat and Ill take
yer for a trot

She rose quickly but restrained herself recollecting that it was not
good policy to betray eagerness in response to an invitation from Ernie

Butyou knowI dont like to go out like this You cantyou
wouldnt like to take me out the way I am Ernie

Why not Wot rot

The fellows would see me andand

And wot

They might notice

Well wot o that I want em to Are yer comin or are yer aint
Fling round now I cant hang on here all day

They walked towards Flagstaff Hill

One or two slouching round a pub corner saluted with Wotcher
Stowsher

Not too stinkin replied Stowsher Soak yer heads

Stowshers goin to stick said one privately

An so he orter said another Wish I had the chanst

The two turned up a steep lane

Dont walk so fast up hill Ernie I cant you know

All right Liz I forgot that Why didnt yer say so before

She was contentedly silent most of the way warned by instinct after
the manner of women when they have gained their point by words

Once he glanced over his shoulder with a short laugh Gorblime he
said I nearly thought the little beggar was afollerin along behind

When he left her at the door he said Look here Liz Eres half a
quid Git what yer want Let her go Im goin to graft again in the
mornin and Ill come round and see yer tomorrer night

Still she seemed troubled and uneasy

Ernie

Well Wot now

Sposin its a girl Ernie

Stowsher flung himself round impatiently

Oh for Gods sake stow that Yer always singin out before yer

open

No Ernie Aint you going to kiss me Im satisfied

Satisfied Yer dont want the kid to be arst oo is father was do
yer Yerd better come along with me some day this week and git spliced
Yer dont want to go frettin or any of that funny business while its

Oh Ernie do you really mean itand she threw her arms round his
neck and broke down at last

     

Solong Liz No more funny business nowIve had enough of it Keep
yer pecker up old girl Tomorrer night mind Then he added suddenly
Yer might have known I aint that sort of a blokeand left abruptly

Liz was very happy




Mr Smellingscheck



I met him in a sixpenny restaurantAll meals 6dGood beds 1s
That was before sixpenny restaurants rose to a thirdclass position
and became possibly respectable places to live in through the
establishment beneath them of fourpenny hashhouses good beds 6d
and beneath THEM again of THREEpenny diningroomsCLEAN beds 4d

There were five beds in our apartment the head of one against the foot
of the next and so on round the room with a space where the door and
washstand were I chose the bed the head of which was near the foot of
his because he looked like a man who took his bath regularly I
should like in the interests of sentiment to describe the place as a
miserable filthy evilsmelling garret but I cantbecause it wasnt
The room was large and airy the floor was scrubbed and the windows
cleaned at least once a week and the beds kept fresh and neat which
is morea good deal morethan can be said of many genteel private
boardinghouses The lodgers were mostly respectable unemployed and
one or twofortunate menin work it was the casual boozer
the professional loafer and the occasional spielerthe
oneshillingbedmenwho made the place objectionable not the
hardworking people who paid ten pounds a week for the house and but
for the onenight lodgers and the big gilt blackandred bordered and
shaded 6d in the windowwhich made me glance guiltily up and down
the street like a burglar about to do a job before I went inI was
pretty comfortable there

They called him Mr Smellingscheck and treated him with a peculiar
kind of deference the reason for which they themselves were doubtless
unable to explain or even understand The haggard woman who made the
beds called him Mr Smellischeck Poor fellow I didnt think by
the look of him that hed smelt his cheque or anyone elses or that
anyone else had smelt his for many a long day He was a fat man slow
and placid He looked like a typical monopolist who had unaccountably
got into a suit of clothes belonging to a Domain unemployed and hadnt
noticed or had entirely forgotten the circumstance in his business
caresif such a word as care could be connected with such a calm
selfcontained nature He wore a suit of cheap slops of some kind of
shoddy tweed The coat was too small and the trousers too short and
they were drawn up to meet the waistcoatwhich they did with painful
difficulty now and then showing by way of protest two pairs of brass
buttons and the ends of the bracestraps and they seemed to blame the
irresponsive waistcoat or the wearer for it all Yet he never gave way
to assist them A pair of burst elasticsides were in full evidence and
a rim of cloudy sock with a hole in it showed at every step

But he put on his clothes and wore them likelike a gentleman He had
two white shirts and they were both dirty Hed lay them out on
the bed turn them over regard them thoughtfully choose that which
appeared to his calm understanding to be the cleaner and put it on and
wear it until it was unmistakably dirtier than the other then hed
wear the other till it was dirtier than the first He managed his three
collars the same way His handkerchiefs were washed in the bathroom and
dried without the slightest disguise in the bedroom He never hurried
in anything The way he cleaned his teeth shaved and made his toilet
almost transformed the place in my imagination into a gentlemans
dressingroom

He talked politics and such things in the abstractalways in the
abstractcalmly in the abstract He was an oldfashioned Conservative
of the Sir Leicester Deadlock style When he was moved by an extra
shower of aggressive democratic cantwhich was seldomhe defended
Capital but only as if it needed no defence and as if its opponents
were merely thoughtless ignorant children whom he condescended to set
right because of their inexperience and for their own good He stuck
calmly to his own orderthe order which had dropped him like a foul
thing when the bottom dropped out of his boom whatever that was He
never talked of his misfortunes

He took his meals at the little greasy table in the dark corner
downstairs just as if he were dining at the Exchange He had a
choprather welldoneand a sheet of the Herald for breakfast He
carried two handkerchiefs he used one for a handkerchief and the other
for a tablenapkin and sometimes folded it absently and laid it on the
table He rose slowly putting his chair back took down his battered
old green hat and regarded it thoughtfullyas though it had just
occurred to him in a calm casual way that hed drop into his hatters
if he had time on his way down town and get it blocked or else send
the messenger round with it during business hours Hed draw his stick
out from behind the next chair plant it and if you hadnt quite
finished your side of the conversation stand politely waiting until you
were done Then hed look for a suitable reply into his hat put it
on give it a twitch to settle it on his headas gentlemen do a
chimneypotstep out into the gangway turn his face to the door and
walk slowly out on to the middle of the pavementlooking more placidly
welltodo than ever The saying is that clothes make a man but HE
made his almost respectable just by wearing them Then hed consult his
watchhe stuck to the watch all through and it seemed a good oneI
often wondered why he didnt pawn it then hed turn slowly right
turn and look down the street Then slowly back leftabout turn and
take a cool survey in that direction as if calmly undecided whether to
take a cab and drive to the Exchange or as it was a very fine morning
and he had half an hour to spare walk there and drop in at his club
on the way Hed conclude to walk I never saw him go anywhere in
particular but he walked and stood as if he could

Coming quietly into the room one day I surprised him sitting at the
table with his arms lying on it and his face resting on them I heard
something like a sob He rose hastily and gathered up some papers which
were on the table then he turned round rubbing his forehead and
eyes with his forefinger and thumb and told me that he suffered
fromsomething I forget the name of it but it was a welltodo
ailment His manner seemed a bit jolted and hurried for a minute or so
and then he was himself again He told me he was leaving for Melbourne
next day He left while I was out and left an envelope downstairs for
me There was nothing in it except a pound note

I saw him in Brisbane afterwards welldressed getting out of a cab at
the entrance of one of the leading hotels But his manner was no more
selfcontained and welltodo than it had been in the old sixpenny
daysbecause it couldnt be We had a welltodo whisky together and
he talked of things in the abstract He seemed just as if hed met me in
the Australia




A Rough Shed



A hot breathless blinding sunrisethe sun having appeared suddenly
above the ragged edge of the barren scrub like a great disc of molten
steel No hint of a morning breeze before it no sign on earth or sky to
show that it is morningsave the position of the sun

A clearing in the scrubbare as though the surface of the earth were
ploughed and harrowed and dusty as the road Two oblong hutsone for
the shearers and one for the rouseaboutsin about the centre of the
clearing as if even the mongrel scrub had shrunk away from them built
endtoend of weatherboards and roofed with galvanised iron Little
ventilation no verandah no attempt to create artificially a breath
of air through the buildings Unpainted sordidhideous Outside heaps
of ashes still hot and smoking Close at hand butchers shopa bush
and bag breakwind in the dust under a couple of sheets of iron with
offal grease and clotted blood blackening the surface of the
ground about it Greasy stinking sheepskins hanging everywhere with
bloodblotched sides out Grease inches deep in great black patches
about the fireplace ends of the huts where washup and boiling water
is thrown

Inside a rough table on supports driven into the black greasy ground
floor and formed of flooring boards running on uneven lines the length
of the hut from within about 6ft of the fireplace Lengths of single
sixinch boards or slabs on each side supported by the projecting ends
of short pieces of timber nailed across the legs of the table to serve
as seats

On each side of the hut runs a rough framework like the partitions in a
stable each compartment battened off to about the size of a manger and
containing four bunks one above the other on each sidetheir ends
of course to the table Scarcely breathing space anywhere between
Fireplace the full width of the hut in one end where all the cooking
and baking for forty or fifty men is done and where flour sugar etc
are kept in open bags Fire like a very furnace Buckets of tea and
coffee on roasting beds of coals and ashes on the hearth Pile of
brownie on the bare black boards at the end of the table Unspeakable
aroma of forty or fifty men who have little inclination and less
opportunity to wash their skins and who soak some of the grease out
of their clothesin buckets of hot wateron Saturday afternoons or
Sundays And clinging to all and over all the smell of the dried
stale yolk of woolthe stink of rams

     

I am a rouseabout of the rouseabouts I have fallen so far that it
is beneath me to try to climb to the proud position of ringer of the
shed I had that ambition once when I was the softest of green hands
but then I thought I could work out my salvation and go home Ive got
used to hell since then I only get twentyfive shillings a week less
station store charges and tucker here I have been seven years west of
the Darling and never shore a sheep Why dont I learn to shear and
so make money What should I do with more money Get out of this and go
home I would never go home unless I had enough money to keep me for
the rest of my life and Ill never make that Out Back Otherwise what
should I do at home And how should I account for the seven years if
I were to go home Could I describe shed life to them and explain how
I lived They think shearing only takes a few days of the yearat the
beginning of summer Theyd want to know how I lived the rest of the
year Could I explain that I jabbed trotters and was a teaandsugar
burglar between sheds Theyd think Id been a tramp and a beggar all
the time Could I explain ANYTHING so that theyd understand Id have
to be lying all the time and would soon be tripped up and found out
For whatever else I have been I was never much of a liar No Ill
never go home

I become momentarily conscious about daylight The flies on the track
got me into that habit I think they start at daybreakwhen the
mosquitoes give over

The cook rings a bullock bell

The cook is fireproof He is as a fiend from the nethermost sheol
and needs to be No man sees him sleep for he makes breador worse
brownieat night and he rings a bullock bell loudly at halfpast
five in the morning to rouse us from our animal torpors Others the
sheephos or the enginedrivers at the shed or woolwash call him if
he does sleep They manage it in shifts somehow and sleep somewhere
sometime We havent time to know The cook rings the bullock bell and
yells the time It was the same time five minutes agoor a year ago
No time to decide which I dash water over my head and face and slap
handfuls on my eyelidsgummed over aching eyesstill blighted by the
yolk o woolgrey greasyfeeling water from a cutdown kerosene
tin which I sneaked from the cook and hid under my bunk and had the
foresight to refill from the cask last night under cover of warm
still suffocating darkness Or was it the night before last Anyhow it
will be sneaked from me today and from the crawler who will collar it
tomorrow and touched and lifted and collared and recovered by
the cook and sneaked back again and cause foul language and fights
maybe till we cutout

No we didnt have sweet dreams of home and mother gentle poetnor
yet of babbling brooks and sweethearts and loves young dream We are
too dirty and dogtired when we tumble down and have too little time to
sleep it off We dont want to dream those dreams out heretheyd only
be nightmares for us and wed wake to remember We MUSTNT remember
here

At the edge of the timber a great galvanisediron shed nearly all
roof coming down to within 6ft 6in of the board over the shoots
Cloud of red dust in the dead timber behind going upnoonday dust
Fence covered with skins carcases being burned blue smoke going
straight up as in noonday Great glossy greasyglossy black crows
flopping around

The first syren has gone We hurry in single files from opposite ends
of rouseabouts and shearers huts as the paths happen to run to the
shed gulping hot tea or coffee from a pintpot in one hand and biting
at a junk of brownie in the other

Shed of forty hands Shearers rush the pens and yank out sheep and
throw them like demons grip them with their knees take up machines
jerk the strings and with a rattling whirring roar the great
machineshed starts for the day

Go it youtigers yells a tarboy Wool away Tar Sheep
Ho We rush through with a whirring roar till breakfast time

We seize our tin plate from the pile knife and fork from the
candlebox and crowd round the campoven to jab out lean chops dry as
chips boiled in fat Chops or curryandrice There is some growling
and cursing We slip into our places without removing our hats Theres
no time to hunt for mislaid hats when the whistle goes Row of hat
brims level drawn over eyes or thrust backaccording to characters
or temperaments Thrust back denotes a lucky absence of brains I fancy
Row of forks going up or jabbing or poised loaded waiting for last
mouthful to be bolted

We pick up sweep tar sew wounds catch sheep that break from the
pens jump down and pick up those that cant rise at the bottom of
the shoots bringmycombsfromthegrinderwillyer laugh at dirty
jokes and swearand in short are the willyer slaves body and
soul of seven six five or four shearers according to the distance
from the rolling tables

The shearer on the board at the shed is a demon He gets so much a
hundred we 25s a week He is not supposed by the rules of the shed
the Union and humanity to take a sheep out of the pen AFTER the bell
goes smokeho meals or knockoff but his watch is hanging on the
post and he times himself to get so many sheep out of the pen BEFORE
the bell goes and ONE MOREthe bellsheepas it is ringing We have
to take the last fleece to the table and leave our board clean We go
through the day of eight hours in runs of about an hour and 20 minutes
between smokehosfrom 6 to 6 If the shearers shore 200 instead of
100 theyd get 2 Pounds a day instead of 1 Pound and wed have twice
as much work to do for our 25s per week But the shearers are racing
each other for tallies And its no use kicking There is no God here
and no Unionism though we all have tickets But what am I growling
about Ive worked from 6 to 6 with no smokehos for half the wages
and food we wouldnt give the sheepho dog Its the bush growl born of
heat flies and dust Id growl now if I had a thousand a year We MUST
growl swear and some of us drink to dts or go mad sober

Pants and shirts stiff with grease as though a couple of pounds of soft
black putty were spread on with a painters knife

No gentle bardwe dont sing at our work Over the whirr and roar
and hum all day long and with iteration that is childish and irritating
to the intelligent greenhand float unthinkable adjectives and adverbs
addressed to jumbucks jackaroos and mates indiscriminately And worse
words for the boss over the boardbehind his back

I came of a Good Christian Familyperhaps thats why I went to the
Devil When I came out here Id shrink from the man who used foul
language In a short time I used it with the worst I couldnt help it

Thats the way of it If I went back to a womans country again I
wouldnt swear Id forget this as I would a nightmare Thats the
way of it Theres something of the larrikin about us We dont exist
individually Off the board away from the shed and each other we are
quieteven gentle

A greathorned ram in poor condition but shorn of a heavy fleece
picks himself up at the foot of the shoot and hesitates as if
ashamed to go down to the other end where the ewes are The most
ridiculous object under Heaven

A tarboy of fifteen of the bush with a mouth so vile that
a streetboy same age up with a shearing uncle kicks him
behindhaving proved his superiority with his fists before the shed
started Of which unspeakable little fiend the roughest shearer of a
rough shed was heard to say in effect that if he thought there was
the slightest possibility of his becoming the father of such a boy
hedtake drastic measures to prevent the possibility of his becoming
a proud parent at all

Twice a day the cooks and their familiars carry buckets of
oatmealwater and tea to the shed two each on a yoke We cry Where
are you coming to my pretty maids

In ten minutes the surfaces of the buckets are black with flies We
have given over trying to keep them clear We stir the living cream
aside with the bottoms of the pints and guzzle gallons and sweat it
out again Occasionally a shearer pauses and throws the perspiration
from his forehead in a rain

Shearers live in such a greedy rush of excitement that often a strong
man will at a prick of the shears fall in a deathlike faint on the
board

We hate the BossoftheBoard as the shearers slushy hates the
shearers cook I dont know why Hes a very fair boss

He refused to put on a traveller yesterday and the traveller knocked
him down He walked into the shed this morning with his hat back and
thumbs in waistcoata tribute to mans weakness He threatened to
dismiss the travellers mate a bigger man for rough shearinga
tribute to mans strength The shearer said nothing We hate the boss
because he IS boss but we respect him because he is a strong man He is
as hard up as any of us I hear and has a sick wife and a large small
family in Melbourne God judge us all

There is a gamblingschool here headed by the shearers cook After
tea they headem and advance cheques are passed from hand to hand and
thrown in the dust until they are black When its too dark to see with
nose to the ground they go inside and gamble with cards Sometimes
they start on Saturday afternoon heading em till dark play cards all
night start again heading em Sunday afternoon play cards all Sunday
night and sleep themselves sane on Monday or go to work ghastlylike
dead men

Cry of Fight we all rush out But there isnt much fighting Afraid
of murdering each other Im beginning to think that most bush crime is
due to irritation born of dust heat and flies

The smothering atmosphere shudders when the sun goes down We call it
the sunset breeze

Saturday night or Sunday were invited into the shearers hut There
are songs that are not hymns and recitations and speeches that are not
prayers

Last Sunday night Slush lamps at long intervals on table Men playing
cards sewing on patchesnearly all smokingsome writing and
the rest reading Deadwood Dick At one end of the table a Christian
Endeavourer endeavouring at the other a cockney Jew from the hawkers
boat trying to sell rotten clothes In response to complaints direct
and not chosen generally for Sunday the shearers rep requests both
apostles to shut up or leave

He couldnt be expected to take the Christian and leave the Jew any
more than he could take the Jew and leave the Christian We are just
amongst ourselves in our hell

     

Fiddle at the end of rouseabouts hut Voice of Jackeroo from upper
bunk with apologetic oaths For Gods sake chuck that up it makes a
man think of blanky old things

A lost soul laughs mine and dreadful night smothers us




Payable Gold



Among the crowds who left the Victorian side for New South Wales about
the time Gulgong broke out was an old Ballarat digger named Peter
McKenzie He had married and retired from the mining some years
previously and had made a home for himself and family at the village of
St Kilda near Melbourne but as was often the case with old diggers
the gold fever never left him and when the fields of New South Wales
began to blaze he mortgaged his little property in order to raise funds
for another campaign leaving sufficient behind him to keep his wife and
family in comfort for a year or so

As he often remarked his position was now very different from what it
had been in the old days when he first arrived from Scotland in the
height of the excitement following on the great discovery He was a
young man then with only himself to look out for but now that he was
getting old and had a family to provide for he had staked too much on
this venture to lose His position did certainly look like a forlorn
hope but he never seemed to think so

Peter must have been very lonely and lowspirited at times A young
or unmarried man can form new ties and even make new sweethearts if
necessary but Peters heart was with his wife and little ones at home
and they were mortgaged as it were to Dame Fortune Peter had to lift
this mortgage off

Nevertheless he was always cheerful even at the worst of times and
his straight grey beard and scrubby brown hair encircled a smile which
appeared to be a fixture He had to make an effort in order to look
grave such as some men do when they want to force a smile

It was rumoured that Peter had made a vow never to return home until
he could take sufficient wealth to make his allimportant family
comfortable or at least to raise the mortgage from the property for
the sacrifice of which to his mad gold fever he never forgave himself
But this was one of the few things which Peter kept to himself

The fact that he had a wife and children at St Kilda was well known to
all the diggers They had to know it and if they did not know the age
complexion history and peculiarities of every child and of the old
woman it was not Peters fault

He would cross over to our place and talk to the mother for hours about
his wife and children And nothing pleased him better than to discover
peculiarities in us children wherein we resembled his own It pleased us
also for mercenary reasons Its just the same with my old woman
or Its just the same with my youngsters Peter would exclaim
boisterously for he looked upon any little similarity between the two
families as a remarkable coincidence He liked us all and was always
very kind to us often standing between our backs and the rod that
spoils the childthat is I mean if it isnt used I was very
shorttempered but this failing was more than condoned by the fact that
Peters eldest was given that way also Mothers second son was very
goodnatured so was Peters third Her third had a great aversion
for any duty that threatened to increase his muscles so had Peters
second Our baby was very fat and heavy and was given to sucking her
own thumb vigorously and according to the latest bulletins from home
it was just the same with Peters last

I think we knew more about Peters family than we did about our own
Although we had never seen them we were as familiar with their features
as the photographers art could make us and always knew their domestic
history up to the date of the last mail

We became interested in the McKenzie family Instead of getting bored by
them as some people were we were always as much pleased when Peter got
a letter from home as he was himself and if a mail were missed which
seldom happenedwe almost shared his disappointment and anxiety Should
one of the youngsters be ill we would be quite uneasy on Peters
account until the arrival of a later bulletin removed his anxiety and
ours

It must have been the glorious power of a big true heart that gained for
Peter the goodwill and sympathy of all who knew him

Peters smile had a peculiar fascination for us children We would
stand by his pointing forge when hed be sharpening picks in the early
morning and watch his face for five minutes at a time wondering
sometimes whether he was always SMILING INSIDE or whether the smile
went on externally irrespective of any variation in Peters condition of
mind

I think it was the latter case for often when he had received bad news
from home we have heard his voice quaver with anxiety while the old
smile played on his round brown features just the same

Little Nelse one of those queer oldman children who seem to come into
the world by mistake and who seldom stay long used to say that Peter
cried inside

Once on Gulgong when he attended the funeral of an old Ballarat
mate a stranger who had been watching his face curiously remarked that
McKenzie seemed as pleased as though the dead digger had bequeathed him
a fortune But the stranger had soon reason to alter his opinion for
when another old mate began in a tremulous voice to repeat the words
Ashes to ashes an dust to dust two big tears suddenly burst from
Peters eyes and hurried down to get entrapped in his beard

Peters goldmining ventures were not successful He sank three duffers
in succession on Gulgong and the fourth shaft after paying expenses
left a little over a hundred to each party and Peter had to send the
bulk of his share home He lived in a tent or in a hut when he could
get one after the manner of diggers and he did for himself even to
washing his own clothes He never drank nor played and he took little
enjoyment of any kind yet there was not a digger on the field who would
dream of calling old Peter McKenzie a mean man He lived as we know
from our own observations in a most frugal manner He always tried to
hide this and took care to have plenty of good things for us when he
invited us to his hut but childrens eyes are sharp Some said that
Peter halfstarved himself but I dont think his family ever knew
unless he told them so afterwards

Ah well the years go over Peter was now three years from home and he
and Fortune were enemies still Letters came by the mail full of little
home troubles and prayers for Peters return and letters went back by
the mail always hopeful always cheerful Peter never gave up When
everything else failed he would work by the day a sad thing for a
digger and he was even known to do a job of fencing until such time
as he could get a few pounds and a small party together to sink another
shaft

Talk about the heroic struggles of early explorers in a hostile country
but for dogged determination and courage in the face of poverty
illness and distance commend me to the oldtime diggerthe truest
soldier Hope ever had

In the fourth year of his struggle Peter met with a terrible
disappointment His party put down a shaft called the Forlorn Hope near
Happy Valley and after a few weeks fruitless driving his mates jibbed
on it Peter had his own opinion about the groundan old diggers
opinion and he used every argument in his power to induce his mates to
put a few days more work in the claim In vain he pointed out that the
quality of the wash and the dip of the bottom exactly resembled that of
the Brown Snake a rich Victorian claim In vain he argued that in the
case of the abovementioned claim not a colour could be got until the
payable gold was actually reached Home Rule and The Canadian and that
cluster of fields were going ahead and his party were eager to shift
They remained obstinate and at last halfconvinced against his
opinion Peter left with them to sink the Iawatha in Log Paddock
which turned out a rank duffernot even paying its own expenses

A party of Italians entered the old claim and after driving it a few
feet further made their fortune

     

We all noticed the change in Peter McKenzie when he came to Log
Paddock whither we had shifted before him The old smile still
flickered but he had learned to look grave for an hour at a time
without much effort He was never quite the same after the affair of
Forlorn Hope and I often think how he must have cried sometimes
inside

However he still read us letters from home and came and smoked in
the evening by our kitchenfire He showed us some new portraits of his
family which he had received by a late mail but something gave me
the impression that the portraits made him uneasy He had them in his
possession for nearly a week before showing them to us and to the best
of our knowledge he never showed them to anybody else Perhaps they
reminded him of the flight of timeperhaps he would have preferred his
children to remain just as he left them until he returned

But stay there was one portrait that seemed to give Peter infinite
pleasure It was the picture of a chubby infant of about three years
or more It was a finelooking child taken in a sitting position on
a cushion and arrayed in a very short shirt On its fat soft white
face which was only a few inches above the ten very podgy toes was a
smile something like Peters Peter was never tired of looking at and
showing the picture of his childthe child he had never seen Perhaps
he cherished a wild dream of making his fortune and returning home
before THAT child grew up

     

McKenzie and party were sinking a shaft at the upper end of Log Paddock
generally called The other end We were at the lower end

One day Peter came down from the other end and told us that his party
expected to bottom during the following week and if they got no
encouragement from the wash they intended to go prospecting at the
Happy Thought near Specimen Flat

The shaft in Log Paddock was christened Nil Desperandum Towards the
end of the week we heard that the wash in the Nil was showing good
colours

Later came the news that McKenzie and party had bottomed on payable
gold and the red flag floated over the shaft Long before the first
load of dirt reached the puddling machine on the creek the news was all
round the diggings The Nil Desperandum was a Golden Hole

     

We will not forget the day when Peter went home He hurried down in the
morning to have an hour or so with us before Cobb and Co went by He
told us all about his little cottage by the bay at St Kilda He had
never spoken of it before probably because of the mortgage He told us
how it faced the bayhow many rooms it had how much flower garden and
how on a clear day he could see from the window all the ships that came
up to the Yarra and how with a good telescope he could even distinguish
the faces of the passengers on the big ocean liners

And then when the mothers back was turned he hustled us children
round the corner and surreptitiously slipped a sovereign into each
of our dirty hands making great pantomimic show for silence for the
mother was very independent

And when we saw the last of Peters face setting like a goodhumoured
sun on the top of Cobb and Cos a great feeling of discontent and
loneliness came over all our hearts Little Nelse who had been Peters
favourite went round behind the pigstye where none might disturb him
and sat down on the projecting end of a trough to have a cry in his
usual methodical manner But old Alligator Desolation the dog had
suspicions of what was up and hearing the sobs went round to offer
whatever consolation appertained to a damp and dirty nose and a pair of
ludicrously doleful yellow eyes




An Oversight of Steelmans



Steelman and Smithprofessional wandererswere making back for
Wellington down through the wide and rather drearylooking Hutt Valley
They were broke They carried their few remaining belongings in two
skimpy amateurishlooking swags Steelman had fourpence left They were
very tired and very thirstyat least Steelman was and he answered for
both It was Smiths policy to feel and think just exactly as Steelman
did Said Steelman

The landlord of the next pub is not a bad sort I wont go inhe
might remember me Youd best go in Youve been tramping round in the
Wairarapa district for the last six months looking for work Youre
going back to Wellington now to try and get on the new corporation
works just being started therethe sewage works You think youve got a
show Youve got some mates in Wellington and theyre looking out for
a chance for you You did get a job last week on a sawmill at
Silverstream and the boss sacked you after three days and wouldnt pay
you a penny Thats just his way I know himat least a mate of mine
does Ive heard of him often enough His names Cowman Dont forget
the name whatever you do The landlord here hates him like poison
hell sympathize with you Tell him youve got a mate with you hes
gone aheadtook a short cut across the paddocks Tell him youve got
only fourpence left and see if hell give you a drop in a bottle Says
you Well boss the fact is weve only got fourpence but you might
let us have a drop in a bottle and very likely hell stand you a
couple of pints in a ginbottle You can fling the coppers on the
counter but the chances are he wont take them Hes not a bad sort
Beers fourpence a pint out here sames in Wellington See that
ginbottle lying there by the stump get it and well take it down to
the river with us and rinse it out

They reached the river bank

Youd better take my swagit looks more decent said Steelman No
Ill tell you what well do well undo both swags and make them into
oneone decent swag and Ill cut round through the lanes and wait for
you on the road ahead of the pub

He rolled up the swag with much care and deliberation and considerable
judgment He fastened Smiths belt round one end of it and
the handkerchiefs round the other and made a towel serve as a
shoulderstrap

I wish we had a canvas bag to put it in he said or a cover of some
sort But never mind The landlords an old Australian bushman now
I come to think of it the swag looks Australian enough and it might
appeal to his feelings you knowbring up old recollections But youd
best not say you come from Australia because hes been there and hed
soon trip you up He might have been where youve been you know so
dont try to do too much You always do mugup the business when you
try to do more than I tell you You might tell him your mate came from
Australiabut no he might want you to bring me in Better stick to
Maoriland I dont believe in too much ornamentation Plain lies are the
best

Whats the landlords name asked Smith

Never mind that You dont want to know that You are not supposed to
know him at all It might look suspicious if you called him by his name
and lead to awkward questions then youd be sure to put your foot into
it

I could say I read it over the door

Bosh Travellers dont read the names over the doors when they go into
pubs Youre an entire stranger to him Call him Boss Say Goodday
Boss when you go in and swing down your swag as if youre used to
it Ease it down like this Then straighten yourself up stick your hat
back and wipe your forehead and try to look as hearty and independent
and cheerful as you possibly can Curse the Government and say the
countrys done It dont matter what Government it is for hes always
against it I never knew a real Australian that wasnt Say that youre
thinking about trying to get over to Australia and then listen to
him talking about itand try to look interested too Get that damned
stonedeaf expression off your face Hell run Australia down most
likely I never knew an Othersider that had settled down over here who
didnt But dont you make any mistake and agree with him because
although successful Australians over here like to run their own country
down theres very few of them that care to hear anybody else do it
Dont come away as soon as you get your beer Stay and listen to him for
a while as if youre interested in his yarning and give him time to
put you on to a job or offer you one Give him a chance to ask how you
and your mate are off for tobacco or tucker Like as not hell sling you
half a crown when you come awaythat is if you work it all right
Now try to think of something to say to him and make yourself a bit
interestingif you possibly can Tell him about the fight we saw back
at the pub the other day He might know some of the chaps This is a
sleepy hole and there aint much news knocking round I wish I could
go in myself but hes sure to remember ME Im afraid he got left the
last time I stayed there so did one or two others and besides I
came away without saying goodbye to him and he might feel a bit sore
about it Thats the worst of travelling on the old road Come on now
wake up

Bet Ill get a quart said Smith brightening up and some tucker for
it to wash down

If you dont said Steelman Ill stoush you Never mind the bottle
fling it away It doesnt look well for a traveller to go into a pub
with an empty bottle in his hand A real swagman never does It looks
much better to come out with a couple of full ones Thats what youve
got to do Now come along

Steelman turned off into a lane cut across the paddocks to the road
again and waited for Smith He hadnt long to wait

Smith went on towards the publichouse rehearsing his part as
he walkedrepeating his lines to himself so as to be sure of
remembering all that Steelman had told him to say to the landlord and
adding with what he considered appropriate gestures some fancy touches
of his own which he determined to throw in in spite of Steelmans
advice and warning Ill tell him thisIll tell him that Well
look here boss Ill say youre pretty right and I quite agree with you
as far as thats concerned but c And so murmuring and mumbling
to himself Smith reached the hotel The day was late and the bar was
small and low and dark Smith walked in with all the assurance he
could muster eased down his swag in a corner in what he no doubt
considered the true professional style and swinging round to the bar
said in a loud voice which he intended to be cheerful independent and
hearty

Goodday boss

But it wasnt a boss It was about the hardestfaced old woman that
Smith had ever seen The pub had changed hands

II beg your pardon missus stammered poor Smith

It was a knockdown blow for Smith He couldnt come to time He and
Steelman had had a landlord in their minds all the time and laid
their plans accordingly the possibility of having a sheand one like
thisto deal with never entered into their calculations Smith had no
time to reorganise even if he had had the brains to do so without the
assistance of his mates knowledge of human nature

II beg your pardon missus he stammered

Painful pause She sized him up

Well what do you want

Well missusIthe fact iswill you give me a bottle of beer for
fourpence

Whawhat

I mean The fact is weve only got fourpence left andIve got a
mate outside and you might let us have a quart or so in a bottle for
that I meananyway you might let us have a pint Im very sorry to
bother you missus

But she couldnt do it No Certainly not Decidedly not All her drinks
were sixpence She had her license to pay and the rent and a family to
keep It wouldnt pay out thereit wasnt worth her while It wouldnt
pay the cost of carting the liquor out c c

Well missus poor Smith blurted out at last in sheer desperation
give me what you can in a bottle for this IveIve got a mate
outside And he put the four coppers on the bar

Have you got a bottle

Nobut

If I give you one will you bring it back You cant expect me to give
you a bottle as well as a drink

Yes mum Ill bring it back directly

She reached out a bottle from under the bar and very deliberately
measured out a little over a pint and poured it into the bottle which
she handed to Smith without a cork

Smith went his way without rejoicing It struck him forcibly that he
should have saved the money until they reached Petone or the city
where Steelman would be sure to get a decent drink But how was he to
know He had chanced it and lost Steelman might have done the same
What troubled Smith most was the thought of what Steelman would say he
already heard him in imagination saying Youre a mug SmithSmith
you ARE a mug

But Steelman didnt say much He was prepared for the worst by seeing
Smith come along so soon He listened to his story with an air of gentle
sadness even as a stern father might listen to the voluntary confession
of a wayward child then he held the bottle up to the fading light of
departing day looked through it the bottle and said

Wellit aint worth while dividing it

Smiths heart shot right down through a hole in the sole of his left
boot into the hard road

Here Smith said Steelman handing him the bottle drink it old
man you want it It wasnt altogether your fault it was an oversight
of mine I didnt bargain for a woman of that kind and of course YOU
couldnt be expected to think of it Drink it Drink it down Smith
Ill manage to work the oracle before this night is out

Smith was forced to believe his ears and recovering from his surprise
drank

I promised to take back the bottle he said with the ghost of a
smile

Steelman took the bottle by the neck and broke it on the fence

Come on Smith Ill carry the swag for a while

And they tramped on in the gathering starlight




How Steelman told his Story



It was Steelmans humour in some of his moods to take Smith into his
confidence as some old bushmen do their dogs

Youre nearly as good as an intelligent sheepdog to talk to
Smithwhen a man gets tired of thinking to himself and wants a relief
Youre a bit of a mug and a good deal of an idiot and the chances are
that you dont know what Im driving at half the timethats the main
reason why I dont mind talking to you You ought to consider yourself
honoured it aint every man I take into my confidence even that far

Smith rubbed his head

Id sooner talk to youor a stumpany day than to one of those
silent suspicious selfcontained worldlywise chaps that listen to
everything you saysense and rubbish alikeas if you were trying to
get them to take shares in a mine I drop the man who listens to me all
the time and doesnt seem to get bored He isnt safe He isnt to be
trusted He mostly wants to grind his axe against yours and theres
too little profit for me where there are two axes to grind and no
stonethough Id manage it once anyhow

Howd you do it asked Smith

There are several ways Either you join forces for instance and find
a grindstoneor make one of the other mans axe But the last way is
too slow and as I said takes too much brainworkbesides it doesnt
pay It might satisfy your vanity or pride but Ive got none I had
once when I was younger but itwell it nearly killed me so I
dropped it

You can mostly trust the man who wants to talk more than you do hell
make a safe mateor a good grindstone

Smith scratched the nape of his neck and sat blinking at the fire with
the puzzled expression of a woman pondering over a lifequestion or the
trimming of a hat Steelman took his chin in his hand and watched Smith
thoughtfully

II say Steely exclaimed Smith suddenly sitting up and scratching
his head and blinking harder than everwhawhat am I

How do you mean

Am I the axe or the grindstone

Oh your brain seems in extra good working order tonight Smith Well
you turn the grindstone and I grind Smith settled If you could
grind better than I Id turn the stone and let YOU grind Id never go
against the interests of the firmthats fair enough isnt it

Yees admitted Smith I suppose so

So do I Now Smith weve got along all right together for years off
and on but you never know what might happen I might stop breathing
for instanceand so might you

Smith began to look alarmed

Poetical justice might overtake one or both of ussuch things have
happened before though not often Or say misfortune or death might
mistake us for honest hardworking mugs with big families to keep and
cut us off in the bloom of all our wisdom You might get into trouble
and in that case Id be bound to leave you there on principle or
I might get into trouble and you wouldnt have the brains to get me
outthough I know youd be mug enough to try I might make a rise and
cut you or you might be misled into showing some spirit and clear out
after Id stoushed you for it You might get tired of me calling you a
mug and bossing you and making a tool or convenience of you you know
You might go in for honest graft you were always a bit weakminded and
then Id have to wash my hands of you unless you agreed to keep me
for an irreclaimable mug Or it might suit me to become a respected and
worthy fellow townsman and then if you came within ten miles of me
or hinted that you ever knew me Id have you up for vagrancy or
soliciting alms or attempting to levy blackmail Id have to fix
youso I give you fair warning Or we might get into some desperate
fix and it neednt be very desperate either when Id be obliged to
sacrifice you for my own personal safety comfort and convenience
Hundreds of things might happen

Well as I said weve been at large together for some years and Ive
found you sober trustworthy and honest so in case we do partas we
will sooner or laterand you survive Ill give you some advice from my
own experience

In the first place If you ever happen to get born againand it
wouldnt do you much harmget born with the strength of a bullock and
the hide of one as well and a swelled head and no brainsat least
no more brains than youve got now I was born with a skin like
tissuepaper and brains also a heart

Get born without relatives if you can if you cant help it clear out
on your own just as soon after youre born as you possibly can I hung
on

If you have relations and feel inclined to help them any time when
youre flush and theres no telling what a weakminded man like you
might take it into his head to dodont do it Theyll get a down on
you if you do It only causes family troubles and bitterness Theres
no dislike like that of a dependant Youll get neither gratitude
nor civility in the end and be lucky if you escape with a character
Youve got NO character Smith Im only just supposing you have
Theres no hatred too bitter for and nothing too bad to be said of the
mug who turns The worst yarns about a man are generally started by his
own tribe and the world believes them at once on that very account
Well the first thing to do in life is to escape from your friends

If you ever go to workand miracles have happened beforeno matter
what your wages are or how you are treated you can take it for granted
that youre sweated act on that to the best of your ability or youll
never rise in the world If you go to see a show on the nod youll be
found a comfortable seat in a good place but if you pay the chances
are the ticket clerk will tell you a lie and youll have to hustle for
standing room The man that doesnt ante gets the best of this world
anything hell stand is good enough for the man that pays If you try to
be too sharp youll get into gaol sooner or later if you try to be too
honest the chances are that the bailiff will get into your houseif you
have oneand make a holy show of you before the neighbours The honest
softy is more often mistaken for a swindler and accused of being one
than the outandout scamp and the man that tells the truth too much
is set down as an irreclaimable liar But most of the time crow low
and roost high for its a funny world and you never know what might
happen

And if you get married and theres no accounting for a womans taste
be as bad as you like and then moderately good and your wife will
love you If youre bad all the time she cant stand it for ever and if
youre good all the time shell naturally treat you with contempt Never
explain what youre going to do and dont explain afterwards if you
can help it If you find yourself between two stools strike hard for
your own self Smithstrike hard and youll be respected more than if
you fought for all the world Generosity isnt understood nowadays and
what the people dont understand is either mad or cronk Failure has
no case and you cant build one for it I started out in life very
youngand very soft

     

I thought you were going to tell me your story Steely remarked
Smith

Steelman smiled sadly

About the author



Henry Lawson was born near Grenfell New South Wales Australia on
17 June 1867 Although he has since become Australias most acclaimed
writer in his own lifetime his writing was often on the sidehis
real work being whatever he could find His writing was frequently
taken from memories of his childhood especially at PipeclayEurunderee
In his autobiography he states that many of his characters were
taken from the better class of diggers and bushmen he knew there
His experiences at this time deeply influenced his work for it is
interesting to note a number of descriptions and phrases that are
identical in his autobiography and in his stories and poems He died at
Sydney 2 September 1922 He is most famous for his short stories

On the Track and Over the Sliprails were both published at Sydney
in 1900 the prefaces being dated March and June respectivelyand so
though printed separately a combined edition was printed the same
year the two separate complete works were simply put together in one
binding hence they are sometimes referred to as On the Track and Over
the Sliprails

     

An incomplete Glossary of Australian terms and concepts which may prove
helpful to understanding this book

 Anniversary Day Alluded to in the text is now known as Australia
 Day It commemorates the establishment of the first English
 settlement in Australia at Port Jackson Sydney Harbour on 26
 January 1788

 Billy A kettle used for camp cooking especially to boil water for
 tea

 CabbagetreeCabbagetree hat A widebrimmed hat made with the
 leaves of the cabbage tree palm Livistona australis It was a
 common hat in early colonial days and later became associated with
 patriotism

 Gin An aboriginal woman use of the term is analogous to squaw
 in N America May be considered derogatory in modern usage

 Graft Work hard work

 Humpy Aboriginal A rough or temporary hut or shelter in the bush
 especially one built from bark branches and the like A gunyah
 wurley or miamia

 JackerooJackaroo At the time Lawson wrote a Jackeroo was a new
 chum or newcomer to Australia who sought work on a station to
 gain experience The term now applies to any young man working as a
 station hand A female station hand is a Jillaroo

 Jumbuck A sheep

 Larrikin A hoodlum

 Lollies Candy sweets

 PossumPossum In Australia a class of marsupials that were
 originally mistaken for the American animal of the same name They
 are not especially related to the possums of North and South
 America other than being marsupials

 PublicPub The traditional pub in Australia was a hotel with a
 public barhence the name The modern pub has often not always
 dispensed with the lodging and concentrated on the bar

 Push A group of people sharing something in common Lawson uses the
 word in an older and more particular sense as a gang of violent
 city hoodlums

 Ratty Shabby dilapidated somewhat eccentric perhaps even
 slightly mad

 Selector A free selector a farmer who selected and settled land
 by lease or license from the government

 Shout To buy a round of drinks

 Sliprailssliprails movable rails forming a section of fence
 which can be taken down in lieu of a gate

 Sly grog shop or shanty An unlicensed bar or liquorstore
 especially one selling cheap or poorquality liquor

 Squatter A person who first settled on land without government
 permission and later continued by lease or license generally to
 raise stock a wealthy rural landowner

 Station A farm or ranch especially one devoted to cattle or sheep

 Stoush Violence to do violence to

 Tea In addition to the regular meaning Tea can also mean a light
 snack or a meal ie where Tea is served In particular Morning
 Tea about 10 AM and Afternoon Tea about 3 PM are nothing more
 than a snack but Evening Tea about 6 PM is a meal When just
 Tea is used it usually means the evening meal Variant Tea
 time

 Tucker Food


 Also a hint with the seasonsremember that the seasons are
 reversed from those in the northern hemisphere hence June may be
 hot but December is even hotter Australia is at a lower latitude
 than the United States so the winters are not harsh by US
 standards and are not even mild in the north In fact large parts
 of Australia are governed more by dry versus wet than by Spring
 SummerFallWinter
