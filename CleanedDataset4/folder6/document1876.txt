THE SHAPE OF FEAR

TIM OCONNORwho was descended from the OConors with one N started
life as a poet and an enthusiast His mother had designed him for
the priesthood and at the age of fifteen most of his verses had an
ecclesiastical tinge but somehow or other he got into the newspaper
business instead and became a pessimistic gentleman with a literary
style of great beauty and an income of modest proportions He fell in
with men who talked of art for arts sakethough what right they had
to speak of art at all nobody knewand little by little his view of
life and love became more or less profane He met a woman who sucked
his hearts blood and he knew it and made no protest nay to the great
amusement of the fellows who talked of art for arts sake he went the
length of marrying her He could not in decency explain that he had
the traditions of fine gentlemen behind him and so had to do as he did
because his friends might not have understood He laughed at the days
when he had thought of the priesthood blushed when he ran across any of
those tender and exquisite old verses he had written in his youth
and became addicted to absinthe and other less peculiar drinks and to
gaming a little to escape a madness of ennui

As the years went by he avoided with more and more scorn that part of
the world which he denominated Philistine and consorted only with the
fellows who flocked about Jim OMalleys saloon He was pleased with
solitude or with these convivial wits and with not very much else
beside Jim OMalley was a sort of Irish poem set to inspiring measure
He was in fact a Hibernian Maecenas who knew better than to put
bad whiskey before a man of talent or tell a trite tale in the presence
of a wit The recountal of his disquisitions on politics and other
current matters had enabled no less than three men to acquire national
reputations and a number of wretches having gone the way of men who
talk of art for arts sake and dying in foreign lands or hospitals
or asylums having no one else to be homesick for had been homesick for
Jim OMalley and wept for the sound of his voice and the grasp of his
hearty hand

When Tim OConnor turned his back upon most of the things he was born
to and took up with the life which he consistently lived till the
unspeakable end he was unable to get rid of certain peculiarities For
example in spite of all his debauchery he continued to look like the
Beloved Apostle Notwithstanding abject friendships he wrote limpid and
noble English Purity seemed to dog his heels no matter how violently
he attempted to escape from her He was never so drunk that he was
not an exquisite and even his creditors who had become inured to his
deceptions confessed it was a privilege to meet so perfect a gentleman
The creature who held him in bondage body and soul actually came to
love him for his gentleness and for some quality which baffled her
and made her ache with a strange longing which she could not define
Not that she ever defined anything poor little beast She had skin the
color of pale gold and yellow eyes with brown lights in them and great
plaits of strawcolored hair About her lips was a fatal and sensuous
smile which when it got hold of a mans imagination would not let it
go but held to it and mocked it till the day of his death She was
the incarnation of the Eternal Feminine with all the wifeliness and the
maternity left outshe was ancient yet ever young and familiar as joy
or tears or sin

She took good care of Tim in some ways fed him well nursed him back
to reason after a period of hard drinking saw that he put on overshoes
when the walks were wet and looked after his money She even prized his
brain for she discovered that it was a delicate little machine which
produced gold By association with him and his friends she learned that
a number of apparently useless things had value in the eyes of certain
convenient fools and so she treasured the autographs of distinguished
persons who wrote to himautographs which he disdainfully tossed in the
waste basket She was careful with presentation copies from authors and
she went the length of urging Tim to write a book himself But at that
he balked

Write a book he cried to her his gentle face suddenly white with
passion Who am I to commit such a profanation

She didnt know what he meant but she had a theory that it was
dangerous to excite him and so she sat up till midnight to cook a chop
for him when he came home that night

He preferred to have her sitting up for him and he wanted every
electric light in their apartments turned to the full If by any
chance they returned together to a dark house he would not enter till
she touched the button in the hall and illuminated the room Or if it
so happened that the lights were turned off in the night time and
he awoke to find himself in darkness he shrieked till the woman came
running to his relief and with derisive laughter turned them on
again But when she found that after these frights he lay trembling and
white in his bed she began to be alarmed for the clever goldmaking
little machine and to renew her assiduities and to horde more
tenaciously than ever those valuable curios on which she some day
expected to realize when he was out of the way and no longer in a
position to object to their barter

OConnors idiosyncrasy of fear was a source of much amusement among the
boys at the office where he worked They made open sport of it and
yet recognizing him for a sensitive plant and granting that genius was
entitled to whimsicalities it was their custom when they called for
him after work hours to permit him to reach the lighted corridor before
they turned out the gas over his desk This they reasoned was but a
slight service to perform for the most enchanting beggar in the world

Dear fellow said Rick Dodson who loved him is it the Devil you
expect to see And if so why are you averse Surely the Devil is not
such a bad old chap

You havent found him so

Tim by heaven you know you ought to explain to me A citizen of the
world and a student of its purlieus like myself ought to know what
there is to know Now youre a man of sense in spite of a few
bad habitssuch as myself for example Is this fad of yours
madnesswhich would be quite to your creditfor gadzooks I like a
lunatic Or is it the complaint of a man who has gathered too much
data on the subject of Old Rye Or is it as I suspect something more
occult and therefore more interesting

Rick boy said Tim youre tooinquiring And he turned to his
desk with a look of delicate hauteur

It was the very next night that these two tippling pessimists spent
together talking about certain disgruntled but immortal gentlemen who
having said their say and made the world quite uncomfortable had now
journeyed on to inquire into the nothingness which they postulated The
dawn was breaking in the muggy east the bottles were empty the
cigars burnt out Tim turned toward his friend with a sharp breaking of
sociable silence

Rick he said do you know that Fear has a Shape

And so has my nose

You asked me the other night what I feared Holy father I make my
confession to you What I fear is Fear

Thats because youve drunk too muchor not enough

 Come fill the cup and in the fire of Spring
 Your winter garment of repentance fling

My costume then would be too nebulous for this weather dear boy But
its true what I was saying I am afraid of ghosts

For an agnostic that seems a bit

Agnostic Yes so completely an agnostic that I do not even know that
I do not know God man do you mean you have no ghostsnono things
which shape themselves Why there are things I have done

Dont think of them my boy See nights candles are burnt out and
jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain top

Tim looked about him with a sickly smile He looked behind him and there
was nothing there stared at the blank window where the smoky dawn
showed its offensive face and there was nothing there He pushed away
the moist hair from his haggard facethat face which would look like
the blessed St John and leaned heavily back in his chair

Yon light is not daylight I know it I he murmured drowsily it
is some meteor which the sun exhales to be to thee this night

The words floated off in languid nothingness and he slept Dodson arose
preparatory to stretching himself on his couch But first he bent over
his friend with a sense of tragic appreciation

Damned by the skin of his teeth he muttered A little more and he
would have gone right and the Devil would have lost a good fellow As
it ishe smiled with his usual conceited delight in his own sayings
even when they were uttered in soliloquyhe is merely one of those
splendid gentlemen one will meet with in hell Then Dodson had a
momentary nostalgia for goodness himself but he soon overcame it and
stretching himself on his sofa he too slept

That night he and OConnor went together to hear Faust sung and
returning to the office Dodson prepared to write his criticism Except
for the distant clatter of telegraph instruments or the peremptory
cries of copy from an upper room the office was still Dodson wrote
and smoked his interminable cigarettes O Connor rested his head in
his hands on the desk and sat in perfect silence He did not know when
Dodson finished or when arising and absentmindedly extinguishing the
lights he moved to the door with his copy in his hands Dodson gathered
up the hats and coats as he passed them where they lay on a chair and
called

It is done Tim Come lets get out of this

There was no answer and he thought Tim was following but after he had
handed his criticism to the city editor he saw he was still alone and
returned to the room for his friend He advanced no further than the
doorway for as he stood in the dusky corridor and looked within the
darkened room he saw before his friend a Shape white of perfect
loveliness divinely delicate and pure and ethereal which seemed as the
embodiment of all goodness From it came a soft radiance and a perfume
softer than the wind when it breathes upon a bank of violets stealing
and giving odor Staring at it with eyes immovable sat his friend

It was strange that at sight of a thing so unspeakably fair a coldness
like that which comes from the jewelblue lips of a Muir crevasse
should have fallen upon Dodson or that it was only by summoning all the
manhood that was left in him that he was able to restore light to
the room and to rush to his friend When he reached poor Tim he was
stonestill with paralysis They took him home to the woman who nursed
him out of that attackand later on worried him into another

When he was able to sit up and jeer at things a little again and help
himself to the quail the woman broiled for him Dodson sitting beside
him said

Did you call that little exhibition of yours legerdemain Tim you
sweep Or are you really the Devils bairn

It was the Shape of Fear said Tim quite seriously

But it seemed mild as mothers milk

It was compounded of the good I might have done It is that which I
fear

He would explain no more Latermany months laterhe died patiently
and sweetly in the madhouse praying for rest The little beast with
the yellow eyes had high mass celebrated for him which all things
considered was almost as pathetic as it was amusing

Dodson was in Vienna when he heard of it

Sa sa cried he I wish it wasnt so dark in the tomb What do you
suppose Tim is looking at

As for Jim OMalley he was with difficulty kept from illuminating the
grave with electricity




ON THE NORTHERN ICE


THE winter nights up at Sault Ste Marie are as white and luminous as
the Milky Way The silence which rests upon the solitude appears to be
white also Even sound has been included in Natures arrestment for
indeed save the still white frost all things seem to be obliterated
The stars have a poignant brightness but they belong to heaven and not
to earth and between their immeasurable height and the still ice rolls
the ebon ether in vast liquid billows

In such a place it is difficult to believe that the world is actually
peopled It seems as if it might be the dark of the day after Cain
killed Abel and as if all of humanitys remainder was huddled in
affright away from the awful spaciousness of Creation

The night Ralph Hagadorn started out for Echo Baybent on a pleasant
dutyhe laughed to himself and said that he did not at all object
to being the only man in the world so long as the world remained as
unspeakably beautiful as it was when he buckled on his skates and shot
away into the solitude He was bent on reaching his best friend in time
to act as groomsman and business had delayed him till time was at its
briefest So he journeyed by night and journeyed alone and when the
tang of the frost got at his blood he felt as a spirited horse feels
when it gets free of bit and bridle The ice was as glass his skates
were keen his frame fit and his venture to his taste So he laughed
and cut through the air as a sharp stone cleaves the water He could
hear the whistling of the air as he cleft it

As he went on and on in the black stillness he began to have fancies
He imagined himself enormously talla great Viking of the Northland
hastening over icy fiords to his love And that reminded him that he had
a lovethough indeed that thought was always present with him as a
background for other thoughts To be sure he had not told her that she
was his love for he had seen her only a few times and the auspicious
occasion had not yet presented itself She lived at Echo Bay also and
was to be the maid of honor to his friends bridewhich was one more
reason why he skated almost as swiftly as the wind and why now and
then he let out a shout of exultation

The one cloud that crossed Hagadorns sun of expectancy was the
knowledge that Marie Beaujeus father had money and that Marie lived in
a house with two stories to it and wore otter skin about her throat
and little satinlined mink boots on her feet when she went sledding
Moreover in the locket in which she treasured a bit of her dead
mothers hair there was a black pearl as big as a pea These things
made it difficultperhaps impossiblefor Ralph Hagadorn to say
more than I love you But that much he meant to say though he were
scourged with chagrin for his temerity

This determination grew upon him as he swept along the ice under the
starlight Venus made a glowing path toward the west and seemed eager to
reassure him He was sorry he could not skim down that avenue of light
which flowed from the lovestar but he was forced to turn his back upon
it and face the black northeast

It came to him with a shock that he was not alone His eyelashes were
frosted and his eyeballs blurred with the cold so at first he thought
it might be an illusion But when he had rubbed his eyes hard he
made sure that not very far in front of him was a long white skater in
fluttering garments who sped over the ice as fast as ever werewolf went

He called aloud but there was no answer He shaped his hands and
trumpeted through them but the silence was as beforeit was complete
So then he gave chase setting his teeth hard and putting a tension on
his firm young muscles But go however he would the white skater went
faster After a time as he glanced at the cold gleam of the north star
he perceived that he was being led from his direct path For a moment
he hesitated wondering if he would not better keep to his road but his
weird companion seemed to draw him on irresistibly and finding it sweet
to follow he followed

Of course it came to him more than once in that strange pursuit that
the white skater was no earthly guide Up in those latitudes men see
curious things when the hoar frost is on the earth Hagadorns own
fatherto hark no further than that for an instancewho lived up
there with the Lake Superior Indians and worked in the copper mines
had welcomed a woman at his hut one bitter night who was gone by
morning leaving wolf tracks on the snow Yes it was so and John
Fontanelle the halfbreed could tell you about it any dayif he were
alive Alack the snow where the wolf tracks were is melted now

Well Hagadorn followed the white skater all the night and when the ice
flushed pink at dawn and arrows of lovely light shot up into the cold
heavens she was gone and Hagadorn was at his destination The sun
climbed arrogantly up to his place above all other things and as
Hagadorn took off his skates and glanced carelessly lakeward he beheld
a great windrift in the ice and the waves showing blue and hungry
between white fields Had he rushed along his intended path watching
the stars to guide him his glance turned upward all his body at
magnificent momentum he must certainly have gone into that cold grave

How wonderful that it had been sweet to follow the white skater and
that he followed

His heart beat hard as he hurried to his friends house But he
encountered no wedding furore His friend met him as men meet in houses
of mourning

Is this your wedding face cried Hagadorn Why man starved as I am
I look more like a bridegroom than you

Theres no wedding today

No wedding Why youre not

Marie Beaujeu died last night

Marie

Died last night She had been skating in the afternoon and she came
home chilled and wandering in her mind as if the frost had got in it
somehow She grew worse and worse and all the time she talked of you

Of me

We wondered what it meant No one knew you were lovers

I didnt know it myself mores the pity At least I didnt know

She said you were on the ice and that you didnt know about the big
breakingup and she cried to us that the wind was off shore and the
rift widening She cried over and over again that you could come in by
the old French creek if you only knew

I came in that way

But how did you come to do that Its out of the path We thought
perhaps

But Hagadorn broke in with his story and told him all as it had come to
pass

That day they watched beside the maiden who lay with tapers at her head
and at her feet and in the little church the bride who might have been
at her wedding said prayers for her friend They buried Marie Beaujeu in
her bridesmaid white and Hagadorn was before the altar with her as he
had intended from the first Then at midnight the lovers who were to
wed whispered their vows in the gloom of the cold church and walked
together through the snow to lay their bridal wreaths upon a grave

Three nights later Hagadorn skated back again to his home They wanted
him to go by sunlight but he had his way and went when Venus made her
bright path on the ice

The truth was he had hoped for the companionship of the white skater
But he did not have it His only companion was the wind The only voice
he heard was the baying of a wolf on the north shore The world was as
empty and as white as if God had just created it and the sun had not
yet colored nor man defiled it




THEIR DEAR LITTLE GHOST


THE first time one looked at Elsbeth one was not prepossessed She was
thin and brown her nose turned slightly upward her toes went in just
a perceptible degree and her hair was perfectly straight But when one
looked longer one perceived that she was a charming little creature
The straight hair was as fine as silk and hung in funny little braids
down her back there was not a flaw in her soft brown skin and her
mouth was tender and shapely But her particular charm lay in a look
which she habitually had of seeming to know curious thingssuch as it
is not allotted to ordinary persons to know One felt tempted to say to
her

What are these beautiful things which you know and of which others are
ignorant What is it you see with those wise and pellucid eyes Why is
it that everybody loves you

Elsbeth was my little godchild and I knew her better than I knew any
other child in the world But still I could not truthfully say that I
was familiar with her for to me her spirit was like a fair and fragrant
road in the midst of which I might walk in peace and joy but where I
was continually to discover something new The last time I saw her quite
well and strong was over in the woods where she had gone with her two
little brothers and her nurse to pass the hottest weeks of summer I
followed her foolish old creature that I was just to be near her for
I needed to dwell where the sweet aroma of her life could reach me

One morning when I came from my room limping a little because I am
not so young as I used to be and the lake wind works havoc with me my
little godchild came dancing to me singing

Come with me and Ill show you my places my places my places

Miriam when she chanted by the Red Sea might have been more exultant
but she could not have been more bewitching Of course I knew what
places were because I had once been a little girl myself but unless
you are acquainted with the real meaning of places it would be
useless to try to explain Either you know places or you do notjust
as you understand the meaning of poetry or you do not There are things
in the world which cannot be taught

Elsbeths two tiny brothers were present and I took one by each hand
and followed her No sooner had we got out of doors in the woods than
a sort of mystery fell upon the world and upon us We were cautioned to
move silently and we did so avoiding the crunching of dry twigs

The fairies hate noise whispered my little godchild her eyes
narrowing like a cats

I must get my wand first thing I do she said in an awed undertone
It is useless to try to do anything without a wand

The tiny boys were profoundly impressed and indeed so was I I felt
that at last I should if I behaved properly see the fairies which
had hitherto avoided my materialistic gaze It was an enchanting moment
for there appeared just then to be nothing commonplace about life

There was a swale near by and into this the little girl plunged I
could see her red straw hat bobbing about among the tall rushes and I
wondered if there were snakes

Do you think there are snakes I asked one of the tiny boys

If there are he said with conviction they wont dare hurt her

He convinced me I feared no more Presently Elsbeth came out of the
swale In her hand was a brown cattail perfectly full and round She
carried it as queens carry their sceptresthe beautiful queens we dream
of in our youth

Come she commanded and waved the sceptre in a fine manner So we
followed each tiny boy gripping my hand tight We were all three a
trifle awed Elsbeth led us into a dark underbrush The branches as
they flew back in our faces left them wet with dew A wee path made by
the girls dear feet guided our footsteps Perfumes of elderberry and
wild cucumber scented the air A bird frightened from its nest made
frantic cries above our heads The underbrush thickened Presently the
gloom of the hemlocks was over us and in the midst of the shadowy green
a tulip tree flaunted its leaves Waves boomed and broke upon the
shore below There was a growing dampness as we went on treading very
lightly A little green snake ran coquettishly from us A fat and glossy
squirrel chattered at us from a safe height stroking his whiskers with
a complaisant air

At length we reached the place It was a circle of velvet grass
bright as the first blades of spring delicate as fine seaferns The
sunlight falling down the shaft between the hemlocks flooded it with
a softened light and made the forest round about look like deep purple
velvet My little godchild stood in the midst and raised her wand
impressively

This is my place she said with a sort of wonderful gladness in her
tone This is where I come to the fairy balls Do you see them

See what whispered one tiny boy

The fairies

There was a silence The older boy pulled at my skirt

Do YOU see them he asked his voice trembling with expectancy

Indeed I said I fear I am too old and wicked to see fairies and
yetare their hats red

They are laughed my little girl Their hats are red and as
smallas small She held up the pearly nail of her wee finger to give
us the correct idea

And their shoes are very pointed at the toes

Oh very pointed

And their garments are green

As green as grass

And they blow little horns

The sweetest little horns

I think I see them I cried

We think we see them too said the tiny boys laughing in perfect
glee

And you hear their horns dont you my little godchild asked somewhat
anxiously

Dont we hear their horns I asked the tiny boys

We think we hear their horns they cried Dont you think we do

It must be we do I said Arent we very very happy

We all laughed softly Then we kissed each other and Elsbeth led us out
her wand high in the air

And so my feet found the lost path to Arcady

The next day I was called to the Pacific coast and duty kept me there
till well into December A few days before the date set for my return to
my home a letter came from Elsbeths mother

Our little girl is gone into the Unknown she wrotethat Unknown in
which she seemed to be forever trying to pry We knew she was going and
we told her She was quite brave but she begged us to try some way to
keep her till after Christmas My presents are not finished yet she
made moan And I did so want to see what I was going to have You cant
have a very happy Christmas without me I should think Can you arrange
to keep me somehow till after then We could not arrange either with
God in heaven or science upon earth and she is gone

She was only my little godchild and I am an old maid with no business
fretting over children but it seemed as if the medium of light and
beauty had been taken from me Through this crystal soul I had perceived
whatever was loveliest However what was was I returned to my home
and took up a course of Egyptian history and determined to concern
myself with nothing this side the Ptolemies

Her mother has told me how on Christmas eve as usual she and
Elsbeths father filled the stockings of the little ones and hung them
where they had always hung by the fireplace They had little heart for
the task but they had been prodigal that year in their expenditures
and had heaped upon the two tiny boys all the treasures they thought
would appeal to them They asked themselves how they could have been
so insane previously as to exercise economy at Christmas time and what
they meant by not getting Elsbeth the autoharp she had asked for the
year before

And now began her father thinking of harps But he could not
complete this sentence of course and the two went on passionately and
almost angrily with their task There were two stockings and two piles
of toys Two stockings only and only two piles of toys Two is very
little

They went away and left the darkened room and after a time they
sleptafter a long time Perhaps that was about the time the tiny boys
awoke and putting on their little dressing gowns and bed slippers
made a dash for the room where the Christmas things were always placed
The older one carried a candle which gave out a feeble light The other
followed behind through the silent house They were very impatient and
eager but when they reached the door of the sittingroom they stopped
for they saw that another child was before them

It was a delicate little creature sitting in her white night gown with
two rumpled funny braids falling down her back and she seemed to be
weeping As they watched she arose and putting out one slender
finger as a child does when she counts she made sure over and over
againthree sad timesthat there were only two stockings and two piles
of toys Only those and no more

The little figure looked so familiar that the boys started toward it
but just then putting up her arm and bowing her face in it as Elsbeth
had been used to do when she wept or was offended the little thing
glided away and went out Thats what the boys said It went out as a
candle goes out

They ran and woke their parents with the tale and all the house was
searched in a wonderment and disbelief and hope and tumult But
nothing was found For nights they watched But there was only the
silent house Only the empty rooms They told the boys they must have
been mistaken But the boys shook their heads

We know our Elsbeth said they It was our Elsbeth cryin cause she
hadnt no stockin an no toys and we would have given her all ours
only she went outjus went out

Alack

The next Christmas I helped with the little festival It was none of
my affair but I asked to help and they let me and when we were all
through there were three stockings and three piles of toys and in the
largest one was all the things that I could think of that my dear child
would love I locked the boys chamber that night and I slept on the
divan in the parlor off the sittingroom I slept but little and the
night was very stillso windless and white and still that I think I
must have heard the slightest noise Yet I heard none Had I been in my
grave I think my ears would not have remained more unsaluted

Yet when daylight came and I went to unlock the boys bedchamber door
I saw that the stocking and all the treasures which I had bought for my
little godchild were gone There was not a vestige of them remaining

Of course we told the boys nothing As for me after dinner I went home
and buried myself once more in my history and so interested was I that
midnight came without my knowing it I should not have looked up at all
I suppose to become aware of the time had it not been for a faint
sweet sound as of a child striking a stringed instrument It was so
delicate and remote that I hardly heard it but so joyous and tender
that I could not but listen and when I heard it a second time it seemed
as if I caught the echo of a childs laugh At first I was puzzled Then
I remembered the little autoharp I had placed among the other things in
that pile of vanished toys I said aloud

Farewell dear little ghost Go rest Rest in joy dear little ghost
Farewell farewell

That was years ago but there has been silence since Elsbeth was always
an obedient little thing




A SPECTRAL COLLIE

WILLIAM PERCY CECIL happened to be a younger son so he left homewhich
was Englandand went to Kansas to ranch it Thousands of younger sons
do the same only their destination is not invariably Kansas

An agent at Wichita picked out Cecils farm for him and sent the deeds
over to England before Cecil left He said there was a house on the
place So Cecils mother fitted him out for America just as she had
fitted out another superfluous boy for Africa and parted from him
with an heroic front and big agonies of motherache which she kept to
herself

The boy bore up the way a man of his blood ought but when he went out
to the kennel to see Nita his collie he went to pieces somehow and
rolled on the grass with her in his arms and wept like a booby But the
remarkable part of it was that Nita wept too big hot dog tears which
her master wiped away When he went off she howled like a hungry baby
and had to be switched before she would give any one a nights sleep

When Cecil got over on his Kansas place he fitted up the shack as
cosily as he could and learned how to fry bacon and make soda biscuits
Incidentally he did farming and sunk a heap of money finding out
how not to do things Meantime the Americans laughed at him and were
inclined to turn the cold shoulder and his compatriots of whom there
were a number in the county did not prove to his liking They consoled
themselves for their exiled state in fashions not in keeping with
Cecils traditions His homesickness went deeper than theirs perhaps
and American whiskey could not make up for the loss of his English home
nor flirtations with the gay American village girls quite compensate
him for the loss of his English mother So he kept to himself and had
nostalgia as some men have consumption

At length the loneliness got so bad that he had to see some living thing
from home or make a flunk of it and go back like a cry baby He had
a stiff pride still though he sobbed himself to sleep more than one
night as many a pioneer has done before him So he wrote home for Nita
the collie and got word that she would be sent Arrangements were made
for her care all along the line and she was properly boxed and shipped

As the time drew near for her arrival Cecil could hardly eat He
was too excited to apply himself to anything The day of her expected
arrival he actually got up at five oclock to clean the house and make
it look as fine as possible for her inspection Then he hitched up and
drove fifteen miles to get her The train pulled out just before he
reached the station so Nita in her box was waiting for him on the
platform He could see her in a queer way as one sees the purple centre
of a revolving circle of light for to tell the truth with the long
ride in the morning sun and the beating of his heart Cecil was only
about halfconscious of anything He wanted to yell but he didnt
He kept himself in hand and lifted up the sliding side of the box and
called to Nita and she came out

But it wasnt the man who fainted though he might have done so being
crazy homesick as he was and halffed and overworked while he was yet
soft from an easy life No it was the dog She looked at her masters
face gave one cry of inexpressible joy and fell over in a real
feminine sort of a faint and had to be brought to like any other lady
with camphor and water and a few drops of spirit down her throat Then
Cecil got up on the wagon seat and she sat beside him with her head on
his arm and they rode home in absolute silence each feeling too much
for speech After they reached home however Cecil showed her all over
the place and she barked out her ideas in glad sociability

After that Cecil and Nita were inseparable She walked beside him
all day when he was out with the cultivator or when he was mowing or
reaping She ate beside him at table and slept across his feet at night
Evenings when he looked over the Graphic from home or read the books
his mother sent him that he might keep in touch with the world Nita
was beside him patient but jealous Then when he threw his book or
paper down and took her on his knee and looked into her pretty eyes or
frolicked with her she fairly laughed with delight

In short she was faithful with that faith of which only a dog is
capablethat unquestioning faith to which even the most loving women
never quite attain

However Fate was annoyed at this perfect friendship It didnt give her
enough to do and Fate is a restless thing with a horrible appetite for
variety So poor Nita died one day mysteriously and gave her last
look to Cecil as a matter of course and he held her paws till the last
moment as a stanch friend should and laid her away decently in a pine
box in the cornfield where he could be shielded from public view if he
chose to go there now and then and sit beside her grave

He went to bed very lonely indeed the first night The shack seemed
to him to be removed endless miles from the other habitations of men
He seemed cut off from the world and ached to hear the cheerful little
barks which Nita had been in the habit of giving him by way of good
night Her amiable eye with its friendly light was missing the gay wag
of her tail was gone all her ridiculous ways at which he was never
tired of laughing were things of the past

He lay down busy with these thoughts yet so habituated to Nitas
presence that when her weight rested upon his feet as usual he felt
no surprise But after a moment it came to him that as she was dead the
weight he felt upon his feet could not be hers And yet there it was
warm and comfortable cuddling down in the familiar way He actually
sat up and put his hand down to the foot of the bed to discover what
was there But there was nothing there save the weight And that stayed
with him that night and many nights after

It happened that Cecil was a fool as men will be when they are young
and he worked too hard and didnt take proper care of himself and so
it came about that he fell sick with a low fever He struggled around
for a few days trying to work it off but one morning he awoke only to
the consciousness of absurd dreams He seemed to be on the sea sailing
for home and the boat was tossing and pitching in a weary circle and
could make no headway His heart was burning with impatience but the
boat went round and round in that endless circle till he shrieked out
with agony

The next neighbors were the Taylors who lived two miles and a half
away They were awakened that morning by the howling of a dog before
their door It was a hideous sound and would give them no peace So
Charlie Taylor got up and opened the door discovering there an excited
little collie

Why Tom he called I thought Cecils collie was dead

She is called back Tom

No she aint neither for here she is shakin like an aspin and a
beggin me to go with her Come out Tom and see

It was Nita no denying and the men perplexed followed her to Cecils
shack where they found him babbling

But that was the last of her Cecil said he never felt her on his
feet again She had performed her final service for him he said
The neighbors tried to laugh at the story at first but they knew the
Taylors wouldnt take the trouble to lie and as for Cecil no one would
have ventured to chaff him




THE HOUSE THAT WAS NOT


BART FLEMING took his bride out to his ranch on the plains when she
was but seventeen years old and the two set up housekeeping in three
hundred and twenty acres of corn and rye Off toward the west there was
an unbroken sea of tossing corn at that time of the year when the bride
came out and as her sewing window was on the side of the house which
faced the sunset she passed a good part of each day looking into that
great rustling mass breathing in its succulent odors and listening
to its sibilant melody It was her picture gallery her opera her
spectacle and being sensibleor perhaps being merely happyshe
made the most of it

When harvesting time came and the corn was cut she had much
entertainment in discovering what lay beyond The town was east and it
chanced that she had never ridden west So when the rolling hills of
this newly beholden land lifted themselves for her contemplation and
the harvest sun all in an angry and sanguinary glow sank in the veiled
horizon and at noon a scarf of golden vapor wavered up and down
along the earth line it was as if a new world had been made for her
Sometimes at the coming of a storm a whiplash of purple cloud full
of electric agility snapped along the western horizon

Oh youll see a lot of queer things on these here plains her husband
said when she spoke to him of these phenomena I guess what you see is
the wind

The wind cried Flora You cant see the wind Bart

Now look here Flora returned Bart with benevolent emphasis youre
a smart one but you dont know all I know about this here country Ive
lived here three mortal years waitin for you to git up out of your
mothers arms and come out to keep me company and I know what there is
to know Some things out here is queerso queer folks wouldnt believe
em unless they saw An somes so pigheaded they dont believe their
own eyes As for th wind if you lay down flat and squint toward th
west you can see it blowin along near th ground like a big ribbon
an sometimes its th color of air an sometimes its silver an gold
an sometimes when a storm is comin its purple

If you got so tired looking at the wind why didnt you marry some
other girl Bart instead of waiting for me

Flora was more interested in the first part of Barts speech than in the
last

Oh come on protested Bart and he picked her up in his arms and
jumped her toward the ceiling of the low shack as if she were a little
girlbut then to be sure she wasnt much more

Of all the things Flora saw when the corn was cut down nothing
interested her so much as a low cottage something like her own which
lay away in the distance She could not guess how far it might be
because distances are deceiving out there where the altitude is high
and the air is as clear as one of those mystic balls of glass in which
the sallow mystics of India see the moving shadows of the future

She had not known there were neighbors so near and she wondered for
several days about them before she ventured to say anything to Bart
on the subject Indeed for some reason which she did not attempt to
explain to herself she felt shy about broaching the matter Perhaps
Bart did not want her to know the people The thought came to her
as naughty thoughts will come even to the best of persons that some
handsome young men might be baching it out there by themselves and
Bart didnt wish her to make their acquaintance Bart had flattered her
so much that she had actually begun to think herself beautiful though
as a matter of fact she was only a nice little girl with a lot of
reddishbrown hair and a bright pair of reddishbrown eyes in a white
face

Bart she ventured one evening as the sun at its fiercest rushed
toward the great black hollow of the west who lives over there in that
shack

She turned away from the window where she had been looking at the
incarnadined disk and she thought she saw Bart turn pale But then
her eyes were so blurred with the glory she had been gazing at that she
might easily have been mistaken

I say Bart why dont you speak If theres any one around to
associate with I should think youd let me have the benefit of their
company It isnt as funny as you think staying here alone days and
days

You aint gettin homesick be you sweetheart cried Bart putting
his arms around her You aint gettin tired of my society be yeh

It took some time to answer this question in a satisfactory manner but
at length Flora was able to return to her original topic

But the shack Bart Who lives there anyway

Im not acquainted with em said Bart sharply Aint them biscuits
done Flora

Then of course she grew obstinate

Those biscuits will never be done Bart till I know about that house
and why you never spoke of it and why nobody ever comes down the road
from there Some one lives there I know for in the mornings and at
night I see the smoke coming out of the chimney

Do you now cried Bart opening his eyes and looking at her with
unfeigned interest Well do you know sometimes Ive fancied I seen
that too

Well why not cried Flora in half anger Why shouldnt you

See here Flora take them biscuits out an listen to me There aint
no house there Hello I didnt know youd go for to drop the biscuits
Wait Ill help you pick em up By cracky theyre hot aint they
What you puttin a towel over em for Well you set down here on my
knee so Now you look over at that there house You see it dont yeh
Well it aint there No I saw it the first week I was out here I was
jus half dyin thinkin of you an wonderin why you didnt
write That was the time you was mad at me So I rode over there one
daylookin up company so t speakand there want no house there I
spent all one Sunday lookin for it Then I spoke to Jim Geary about
it He laughed an got a little white about th gills an he said he
guessed Id have to look a good while before I found it He said that
there shack was an ole joke

Whywhat

Well this here is th story he tol me He said a man an his wife
come out here t live an put up that there little place An she was
young you know an kind o skeery and she got lonesome It worked on
her an worked on her an one day she up an killed the baby an her
husband an herself Th folks found em and buried em right there on
their own ground Well about two weeks after that th house was burned
down Dont know how Tramps maybe Anyhow it burned At least I
guess it burned

You guess it burned

Well it aint there you know

But if it burned the ashes are there

All right girlie theyre there then Now lets have tea

This they proceeded to do and were happy and cheerful all evening
but that didnt keep Flora from rising at the first flush of dawn and
stealing out of the house She looked away over west as she went to
the barn and there dark and firm against the horizon stood the
little house against the pellucid sky of morning She got on Gingers
backGinger being her own yellow bronchoand set off at a hard pace
for the house It didnt appear to come any nearer but the objects
which had seemed to be beside it came closer into view and Flora
pressed on with her mind steeled for anything But as she approached
the poplar windbreak which stood to the north of the house the little
shack waned like a shadow before her It faded and dimmed before her
eyes

She slapped Gingers flanks and kept him going and she at last got him
up to the spot But there was nothing there The bunch grass grew tall
and rank and in the midst of it lay a babys shoe Flora thought of
picking it up but something cold in her veins withheld her Then she
grew angry and set Gingers head toward the place and tried to drive
him over it But the yellow broncho gave one snort of fear gathered
himself in a bunch and then all tense leaping muscles made for home
as only a broncho can




STORY OF AN OBSTINATE CORPSE


VIRGIL HOYT is a photographers assistant up at St Paul and enjoys
his work without being consumed by it He has been in search of the
picturesque all over the West and hundreds of miles to the north in
Canada and can speak three or four Indian dialects and put a canoe
through the rapids That is to say he is a man of adventure and no
dreamer He can fight well and shoot better and swim so as to put up a
winning race with the Indian boys and he can sit in the saddle all day
and not worry about it tomorrow

Wherever he goes he carries a camera

The world Hoyt is in the habit of saying to those who sit with him
when he smokes his pipe was created in six days to be photographed
Manand particularly womanwas made for the same purpose Clouds
are not made to give moisture nor trees to cast shade They have been
created in order to give the camera obscura something to do

In short Virgil Hoyts view of the world is whimsical and he likes to
be bothered neither with the disagreeable nor the mysterious That
is the reason he loathes and detests going to a house of mourning to
photograph a corpse The bad taste of it offends him but above all
he doesnt like the necessity of shouldering even for a few moments a
part of the burden of sorrow which belongs to some one else He dislikes
sorrow and would willingly canoe five hundred miles up the cold
Canadian rivers to get rid of it Nevertheless as assistant
photographer it is often his duty to do this very kind of thing

Not long ago he was sent for by a rich Jewish family to photograph the
remains of the mother who had just died He was put out but he was
only an assistant and he went He was taken to the front parlor where
the dead woman lay in her coffin It was evident to him that there was
some excitement in the household and that a discussion was going on
But Hoyt said to himself that it didnt concern him and he therefore
paid no attention to it

The daughter wanted the coffin turned on end in order that the corpse
might face the camera properly but Hoyt said he could overcome the
recumbent attitude and make it appear that the face was taken in the
position it would naturally hold in life and so they went out and left
him alone with the dead

The face of the deceased was a strong and positive one such as
may often be seen among Jewish matrons Hoyt regarded it with some
admiration thinking to himself that she was a woman who had known
what she wanted and who once having made up her mind would prove
immovable Such a character appealed to Hoyt He reflected that he
might have married if only he could have found a woman with strength of
character sufficient to disagree with him There was a strand of hair
out of place on the dead womans brow and he gently pushed it back
A bud lifted its head too high from among the roses on her breast and
spoiled the contour of the chin so he broke it off He remembered these
things later with keen distinctness and that his hand touched her chill
face two or three times in the making of his arrangements

Then he took the impression and left the house

He was busy at the time with some railroad work and several days passed
before he found opportunity to develop the plates He took them from
the bath in which they had lain with a number of others and went
energetically to work upon them whistling some very saucy songs he had
learned of the guide in the Red River country and trying to forget that
the face which was presently to appear was that of a dead woman He had
used three plates as a precaution against accident and they came
up well But as they developed he became aware of the existence of
something in the photograph which had not been apparent to his eye
in the subject He was irritated and without attempting to face the
mystery he made a few prints and laid them aside ardently hoping that
by some chance they would never be called for

However as luck would have itand Hoyts luck never had been
goodhis employer asked one day what had become of those photographs
Hoyt tried to evade making an answer but the effort was futile and he
had to get out the finished prints and exhibit them The older man sat
staring at them a long time

Hoyt he said youre a young man and very likely you have never
seen anything like this before But I have Not exactly the same thing
perhaps but similar phenomena have come my way a number of times since
I went in the business and I want to tell you there are things in
heaven and earth not dreamt of

Oh I know all that tommyrot cried Hoyt angrily but when anything
happens I want to know the reason why and how it is done

All right answered his employer then you might explain why and how
the sun rises

But he humored the young man sufficiently to examine with him the baths
in which the plates were submerged and the plates themselves All was
as it should be but the mystery was there and could not be done away
with

Hoyt hoped against hope that the friends of the dead woman would somehow
forget about the photographs but the idea was unreasonable and one
day as a matter of course the daughter appeared and asked to see the
pictures of her mother

Well to tell the truth stammered Hoyt they didnt come out
quitequite as well as we could wish

But let me see them persisted the lady Id like to look at them
anyhow

Well now said Hoyt trying to be soothing as he believed it was
always best to be with womento tell the truth he was an ignoramus
where women were concernedI think it would be better if you didnt
look at them There are reasons why he ambled on like this stupid
man that he was till the lady naturally insisted upon seeing the
pictures without a moments delay

So poor Hoyt brought them out and placed them in her hand and then
ran for the water pitcher and had to be at the bother of bathing her
forehead to keep her from fainting

For what the lady saw was this Over face and flowers and the head of
the coffin fell a thick veil the edges of which touched the floor in
some places It covered the features so well that not a hint of them was
visible

There was nothing over mothers face cried the lady at length

Not a thing acquiesced Hoyt I know because I had occasion to touch
her face just before I took the picture I put some of her hair back
from her brow

What does it mean then asked the lady

You know better than I There is no explanation in science Perhaps
there is some inin psychology

Well said the young woman stammering a little and coloring mother
was a good woman but she always wanted her own way and she always had
it too

Yes

And she never would have her picture taken She didnt admire her own
appearance She said no one should ever see a picture of her

So said Hoyt meditatively Well shes kept her word hasnt she

The two stood looking at the photographs for a time Then Hoyt pointed
to the open blaze in the grate

Throw them in he commanded Dont let your father see themdont
keep them yourself They wouldnt be agreeable things to keep

Thats true enough admitted the lady And she threw them in the fire
Then Virgil Hoyt brought out the plates and broke them before her eyes

And that was the end of itexcept that Hoyt sometimes tells the story
to those who sit beside him when his pipe is lighted




A CHILD OF THE RAIN


IT was the night that Mona Meeks the dressmaker told him she didnt
love him He couldnt believe it at first because he had so long been
accustomed to the idea that she did and no matter how rough the weather
or how irascible the passengers he felt a song in his heart as he
punched transfers and rang his bell punch and signalled the driver
when to let people off and on

Now suddenly with no reason except a womans she had changed her
mind He dropped in to see her at five oclock just before time for the
night shift and to give her two red apples he had been saving for her
She looked at the apples as if they were invisible and she could not see
them and standing in her disorderly little dressmaking parlor with its
cuttings and scraps and litter of fabrics she said

It is no use John I shall have to work here like this all my
lifework here alone For I dont love you John No I dont I
thought I did but it is a mistake

You mean it asked John bringing up the words in a great gasp

Yes she said white and trembling and putting out her hands as if to
beg for his mercy And thenbig lumbering foolhe turned around
and strode down the stairs and stood at the corner in the beating rain
waiting for his car It came along at length spluttering on the wet
rails and spitting out blue fire and he took his shift after a gruff
Good night to Johnson the man he relieved

He was glad the rain was bitter cold and drove in his face fiercely
He rejoiced at the cruelty of the wind and when it hustled pedestrians
before it lashing them twisting their clothes and threatening their
equilibrium he felt amused He was pleased at the chill in his bones
and at the hunger that tortured him At least at first he thought it
was hunger till he remembered that he had just eaten The hours passed
confusedly He had no consciousness of time But it must have been
latenear midnightjudging by the fact that there were few persons
visible anywhere in the black storm when he noticed a little figure
sitting at the far end of the car He had not seen the child when she
got on but all was so curious and wild to him that eveninghe himself
seemed to himself the most curious and the wildest of all thingsthat
it was not surprising that he should not have observed the little
creature

She was wrapped in a coat so much too large that it had become frayed
at the bottom from dragging on the pavement Her hair hung in unkempt
stringiness about her bent shoulders and her feet were covered with old
arctics many sizes too big from which the soles hung loose

Beside the little figure was a chest of dark wood with curiously
wrought hasps From this depended a stout strap by which it could be
carried over the shoulders John Billings stared in fascinated by the
poor little thing with its head sadly drooping upon its breast its thin
blue hands relaxed upon its lap and its whole attitude so suggestive
of hunger loneliness and fatigue that he made up his mind he would
collect no fare from it

It will need its nickel for breakfast he said to himself The
company can stand this for once Or come to think of it I might
celebrate my hard luck Heres to the brotherhood of failures And
he took a nickel from one pocket of his greatcoat and dropped it in
another ringing his bell punch to record the transfer

The car plunged along in the darkness and the rain beat more viciously
than ever in his face The night was full of the rushing sound of the
storm Owing to some change of temperature the glass of the car became
obscured so that the young conductor could no longer see the little
figure distinctly and he grew anxious about the child

I wonder if its all right he said to himself I never saw living
creature sit so still

He opened the car door intending to speak with the child but just
then something went wrong with the lights There was a blue and green
flickering then darkness a sudden halting of the car and a great
sweep of wind and rain in at the door When after a moment light and
motion reasserted themselves and Billings had got the door together he
turned to look at the little passenger But the car was empty

It was a fact There was no child therenot even moisture on the seat
where she had been sitting

Bill said he going to the front door and addressing the driver
what became of that little kid in the old cloak

I didnt see no kid said Bill crossly For Gawds sake close the
door John and git that draught off my back

Draught said John indignantly wheres the draught

Youve left the hind door open growled Bill and John saw him
shivering as a blast struck him and ruffled the fur on his bearskin
coat But the door was not open and yet John had to admit to himself
that the car seemed filled with wind and a strange coldness

However it didnt matter Nothing mattered Still it was as well no
doubt to look under the seats just to make sure no little crouching
figure was there and so he did But there was nothing In fact John
said to himself he seemed to be getting expert in finding nothing where
there ought to be something

He might have stayed in the car for there was no likelihood of more
passengers that evening but somehow he preferred going out where the
rain could drench him and the wind pommel him How horribly tired he
was If there were only some still place away from the blare of the city
where a man could lie down and listen to the sound of the sea or the
stormor if one could grow suddenly old and get through with the bother
of livingor if

The car gave a sudden lurch as it rounded a curve and for a moment it
seemed to be a mere chance whether Conductor Billings would stay on
his platform or go off under those firespitting wheels He caught
instinctively at his brake saved himself and stood still for a moment
panting

I must have dozed he said to himself

Just then dimly through the blurred window he saw again the little
figure of the child its head on its breast as before its blue hands
lying in its lap and the curious box beside it John Billings felt a
coldness beyond the coldness of the night run through his blood Then
with a halfstifled cry he threw back the door and made a desperate
spring at the corner where the eerie thing sat

And he touched the green carpeting on the seat which was quite dry
and warm as if no dripping miserable little wretch had ever crouched
there

He rushed to the front door

Bill he roared I want to know about that kid

What kid

The same kid The wet one with the old coat and the box with iron
hasps The one thats been sitting here in the car

Bill turned his surly face to confront the young conductor

Youve been drinking you fool said he Fust thing you know youll
be reported

The conductor said not a word He went slowly and weakly back to his
post and stood there the rest of the way leaning against the end of the
car for support Once or twice he muttered

The poor little brat And again he said So you didnt love me after
all

He never knew how he reached home but he sank to sleep as dying men
sink to death All the same being a hearty young man he was on duty
again next day but one and again the night was rainy and cold

It was the last run and the car was spinning along at its limit when
there came a sudden soft shock John Billings knew what that meant He
had felt something of the kind once before He turned sick for a moment
and held on to the brake Then he summoned his courage and went around
to the side of the car which had stopped Bill the driver was before
him and had a limp little figure in his arms and was carrying it to
the gaslight John gave one look and cried

Its the same kid Bill The one I told you of

True as truth were the ragged coat dangling from the pitiful body the
little blue hands the thin shoulders the stringy hair the big arctics
on the feet And in the road not far off was the curious chest of dark
wood with iron hasps

She ran under the car deliberate cried Bill I yelled to her but
she looked at me and ran straight on

He was white in spite of his weatherbeaten skin

I guess you wasnt drunk last night after all John said he

Youyou are sure the kid isis there gasped John

Not so damned sure said Bill

But a few minutes later it was taken away in a patrol wagon and with it
the little box with iron hasps




THE ROOM OF THE EVIL THOUGHT


THEY called it the room of the Evil Thought It was really the
pleasantest room in the house and when the place had been used as the
rectory was the ministers study It looked out on a mournful clump
of larches such as may often be seen in the oldfashioned yards in
Michigan and these threw a tender gloom over the apartment

There was a wide fireplace in the room and it had been the young
ministers habit to sit there hours and hours staring ahead of him at
the fire and smoking moodily The replenishing of the fire and of his
pipe it was said would afford him occupation all the day long and
that was how it came about that his parochial duties were neglected so
that little by little the people became dissatisfied with him though
he was an eloquent young man who could send his congregation away drunk
on his influence However the calmer pulsed among his parish began to
whisper that it was indeed the influence of the young minister and not
that of the Holy Ghost which they felt and it was finally decided
that neither animal magnetism nor hypnotism were good substitutes for
religion And so they let him go

The new rector moved into a smart brick house on the other side of the
church and gave receptions and dinner parties and was punctilious
about making his calls The people therefore liked him very muchso
much that they raised the debt on the church and bought a chime of
bells in their enthusiasm Every one was lighter of heart than under
the ministration of the previous rector A burden appeared to be lifted
from the community True there were a few who confessed the new man
did not give them the food for thought which the old one had done but
then the former rector had made them uncomfortable He had not only
made them conscious of the sins of which they were already guilty but
also of those for which they had the latent capacity A strange and
fatal man whom women loved to their sorrow and whom simple men could
not understand It was generally agreed that the parish was well rid of
him

He was a genius said the people in commiseration The word was an
uncomplimentary epithet with them

When the Hanscoms moved in the house which had been the old rectory
they gave Grandma Hanscom the room with the fireplace Grandma was well
pleased The roaring fire warmed her heart as well as her chill old
body and she wept with weak joy when she looked at the larches because
they reminded her of the house she had lived in when she was first
married All the forenoon of the first day she was busy putting things
away in bureau drawers and closets but by afternoon she was ready to
sit down in her highbacked rocker and enjoy the comforts of her room

She nodded a bit before the fire as she usually did after luncheon and
then she awoke with an awful start and sat staring before her with such
a look in her gentle filmy old eyes as had never been there before
She did not move except to rock slightly and the Thought grew and grew
till her face was disguised as by some hideous mask of tragedy

By and by the children came pounding at the door

Oh grandma let us in please We want to see your new room and mamma
gave us some ginger cookies on a plate and we want to give some to
you

The door gave way under their assaults and the three little ones stood
peeping in waiting for permission to enter But it did not seem to be
their grandmatheir own dear grandmawho arose and tottered toward
them in fierce haste crying

Away away Out of my sight Out of my sight before I do the thing I
want to do Such a terrible thing Send some one to me quick children
children Send some one quick

They fled with feet shod with fear and their mother came and Grandma
Hanscom sank down and clung about her skirts and sobbed

Tie me Miranda Make me fast to the bed or the wall Get some one to
watch me For I want to do an awful thing

They put the trembling old creature in bed and she raved there all
the night long and cried out to be held and to be kept from doing the
fearful thing whatever it wasfor she never said what it was

The next morning some one suggested taking her in the sittingroom
where she would be with the family So they laid her on the sofa hemmed
around with cushions and before long she was her quiet self again
though exhausted naturally with the tumult of the previous night
Now and then as the children played about her a shadow crept over
her facea shadow as of cold remembranceand then the perplexed tears
followed

When she seemed as well as ever they put her back in her room But
though the fire glowed and the lamp burned as soon as ever she was
alone they heard her shrill cries ringing to them that the Evil Thought
had come again So Hal who was home from college carried her up to his
room which she seemed to like very well Then he went down to have a
smoke before grandmas fire

The next morning he was absent from breakfast They thought he might
have gone for an early walk and waited for him a few minutes Then
his sister went to the room that looked upon the larches and found him
dressed and pacing the floor with a face set and stern He had not been
in bed at all as she saw at once His eyes were bloodshot his face
stricken as if with old age or sin orbut she could not make it out
When he saw her he sank in a chair and covered his face with his hands
and between the trembling fingers she could see drops of perspiration on
his forehead

Hal she cried Hal what is it

But for answer he threw his arms about the little table and clung to
it and looked at her with tortured eyes in which she fancied she saw
a gleam of hate She ran screaming from the room and her father came
and went up to him and laid his hands on the boys shoulders And then
a fearful thing happened All the family saw it There could be no
mistake Hals hands found their way with frantic eagerness toward his
fathers throat as if they would choke him and the look in his eyes was
so like a madmans that his father raised his fist and felled him as he
used to fell men years before in the college fights and then dragged
him into the sittingroom and wept over him

By evening however Hal was all right and the family said it must have
been a feverperhaps from overstudyat which Hal covertly smiled
But his father was still too anxious about him to let him out of his
sight so he put him on a cot in his room and thus it chanced that the
mother and Grace concluded to sleep together downstairs

The two women made a sort of festival of it and drank little cups of
chocolate before the fire and undid and brushed their brown braids
and smiled at each other understandingly with that sweet intuitive
sympathy which women have and Grace told her mother a number of things
which she had been waiting for just such an auspicious occasion to
confide

But the larches were noisy and cried out with wild voices and the flame
of the fire grew blue and swirled about in the draught sinuously so
that a chill crept upon the two Something cold appeared to envelop
themsuch a chill as pleasure voyagers feel when a berg steals beyond
Newfoundland and glows blue and threatening upon their ocean path

Then came something else which was not cold but hot as the flames of
helland they saw red and stared at each other with maddened eyes and
then ran together from the room and clasped in close embrace safe beyond
the fatal place and thanked God they had not done the thing that they
dared not speak ofthe thing which suddenly came to them to do

So they called it the room of the Evil Thought They could not account
for it They avoided the thought of it being healthy and happy folk
But none entered it more The door was locked

One day Hal reading the paper came across a paragraph concerning the
young minister who had once lived there and who had thought and
written there and so influenced the lives of those about him that they
remembered him even while they disapproved

He cut a mans throat on board ship for Australia said he and then
he cut his own without fatal effectand jumped overboard and so ended
it What a strange thing

Then they all looked at one another with subtle looks and a shadow fell
upon them and stayed the blood at their hearts

The next week the room of the Evil Thought was pulled down to make way
for a pansy bed which is quite gay and innocent and blooms all the
better because the larches with their eternal murmuring have been laid
low and carted away to the sawmill




STORY OF THE VANISHING PATIENT


THERE had always been strange stories about the house but it was a
sensible comfortable sort of a neighborhood and people took pains to
say to one another that there was nothing in these talesof course
not Absolutely nothing How could there be It was a matter of common
remark however that considering the amount of money the Nethertons had
spent on the place it was curious they lived there so little They
were nearly always awayup North in the summer and down South in the
winter and over to Paris or London now and thenand when they did
come home it was only to entertain a number of guests from the city The
place was either plunged in gloom or gayety The old gardener who kept
house by himself in the cottage at the back of the yard had things much
his own way by far the greater part of the time

Dr Block and his wife lived next door to the Nethertons and he and his
wife who were so absurd as to be very happy in each others company
had the benefit of the beautiful yard They walked there mornings when
the leaves were silvered with dew and evenings they sat beside the lily
pond and listened for the whippoorwill The doctors wife moved her
room over to that side of the house which commanded a view of the yard
and thus made the honeysuckles and laurel and clematis and all the
masses of tossing greenery her own Sitting there day after day with
her sewing she speculated about the mystery which hung impalpably yet
undeniably over the house

It happened one night when she and her husband had gone to their room
and were congratulating themselves on the fact that he had no very sick
patients and was likely to enjoy a good nights rest that a ring came
at the door

If its any one wanting you to leave home warned his wife you must
tell them you are all worn out Youve been disturbed every night this
week and its too much

The young physician went downstairs At the door stood a man whom he had
never seen before

My wife is lying very ill next door said the stranger so ill that
I fear she will not live till morning Will you please come to her at
once

Next door cried the physician I didnt know the Nethertons were
home

Please hasten begged the man I must go back to her Follow as
quickly as you can

The doctor went back upstairs to complete his toilet

How absurd protested his wife when she heard the story There is no
one at the Nethertons I sit where I can see the front door and no one
can enter without my knowing it and I have been sewing by the window
all day If there were any one in the house the gardener would have the
porch lantern lighted It is some plot Some one has designs on you You
must not go

But he went As he left the room his wife placed a revolver in his
pocket

The great porch of the mansion was dark but the physician made out that
the door was open and he entered A feeble light came from the bronze
lamp at the turn of the stairs and by it he found his way his feet
sinking noiselessly in the rich carpets At the head of the stairs the
man met him The doctor thought himself a tall man but the stranger
topped him by half a head He motioned the physician to follow him and
the two went down the hall to the front room The place was flushed with
a rosecolored glow from several lamps On a silken couch in the midst
of pillows lay a woman dying with consumption She was like a lily
white shapely graceful with feeble yet charming movements She looked
at the doctor appealingly then seeing in his eyes the involuntary
verdict that her hour was at hand she turned toward her companion with
a glance of anguish Dr Block asked a few questions The man answered
them the woman remaining silent The physician administered something
stimulating and then wrote a prescription which he placed on the
mantelshelf

The drug store is closed tonight he said and I fear the druggist
has gone home You can have the prescription filled the first thing in
the morning and I will be over before breakfast

After that there was no reason why he should not have gone home Yet
oddly enough he preferred to stay Nor was it professional anxiety that
prompted this delay He longed to watch those mysterious persons who
almost oblivious of his presence were speaking their mortal farewells
in their glances which were impassioned and of unutterable sadness

He sat as if fascinated He watched the glitter of rings on the womans
long white hands he noted the waving of light hair about her temples
he observed the details of her gown of soft white silk which fell about
her in voluminous folds Now and then the man gave her of the stimulant
which the doctor had provided sometimes he bathed her face with water
Once he paced the floor for a moment till a motion of her hand quieted
him

After a time feeling that it would be more sensible and considerate
of him to leave the doctor made his way home His wife was awake
impatient to hear of his experiences She listened to his tale in
silence and when he had finished she turned her face to the wall and
made no comment

You seem to be ill my dear he said You have a chill You are
shivering

I have no chill she replied sharply But Iwell you may leave the
light burning

The next morning before breakfast the doctor crossed the dewy sward to
the Netherton house The front door was locked and no one answered to
his repeated ringings The old gardener chanced to be cutting the grass
near at hand and he came running up

What you ringin that doorbell for doctor said he The folks aint
come home yet There aint nobody there

Yes there is Jim I was called here last night A man came for me to
attend his wife They must both have fallen asleep that the bell is not
answered I wouldnt be surprised to find her dead as a matter of fact
She was a desperately sick woman Perhaps she is dead and something has
happened to him You have the key to the door Jim Let me in

But the old man was shaking in every limb and refused to do as he was
bid

Dont you never go in there doctor whispered he with chattering
teeth Dont you go for to tend no one You jus come tell me when you
sent for that way No I aint goin in doctor nohow It aint part
of my duties to go in Thats been stipulated by Mr Netherton Its my
business to look after the garden

Argument was useless Dr Block took the bunch of keys from the old
mans pocket and himself unlocked the front door and entered He mounted
the steps and made his way to the upper room There was no evidence of
occupancy The place was silent and so far as living creature went
vacant The dust lay over everything It covered the delicate damask of
the sofa where he had seen the dying woman It rested on the pillows
The place smelled musty and evil as if it had not been used for a long
time The lamps of the room held not a drop of oil

But on the mantelshelf was the prescription which the doctor had
written the night before He read it folded it and put it in his
pocket

As he locked the outside door the old gardener came running to him

Dont you never go up there again will you he pleaded not unless
you see all the Nethertons home and I come for you myself You wont
doctor

No said the doctor

When he told his wife she kissed him and said

Next time when I tell you to stay at home you must stay




THE PIANO NEXT DOOR


BABETTE had gone away for the summer the furniture was in its summer
linens the curtains were down and Babettes husband John Boyce was
alone in the house It was the first year of his marriage and he missed
Babette But then as he often said to himself he ought never to
have married her He did it from pure selfishness and because he was
determined to possess the most illusive tantalizing elegant and
utterly unmoral little creature that the sun shone upon He wanted her
because she reminded him of birds and flowers and summer winds
and other exquisite things created for the delectation of mankind He
neither expected nor desired her to think He had halffrightened her
into marrying him had taken her to a poor mans home provided her with
no society such as she had been accustomed to and he had no reasonable
cause of complaint when she answered the call of summer and flitted
away like a butterfly in the morning sunshine to the place where the
flowers grew

He wrote to her every evening sitting in the stifling ugly house and
poured out his soul as if it were a libation to a goddess She sometimes
answered by telegraph sometimes by a perfumed note He schooled himself
not to feel hurt Why should Babette write Does a goldfinch indict
epistles or a hummingbird study composition or a glancing redscaled
fish in summer shallows consider the meaning of words

He knew at the beginning what Babette wasguessed her
limitationstrembled when he buttoned her tiny glovekissed her dainty
slipper when he found it in the closet after she was gonethrilled at
the sound of her laugh or the memory of it That was all A mere case
of love He was in bonds Babette was not Therefore he was in the
city working overhours to pay for Babettes pretty follies down at the
seaside It was quite right and proper He was a grub in the furrow
she a lark in the blue Those had always been and always must be their
relative positions

Having attained a mood of philosophic calm in which he was prepared to
spend his evenings aloneas became a gruband to await with
dignified patience the return of his wife it was in the nature of an
inconsistency that he should have walked the floor of the dull little
drawingroom like a lion in cage It did not seem in keeping with
the position of superior serenity which he had assumed that reading
Babettes notes he should have raged with jealousy or that in the
loneliness of his unkempt chamber he should have stretched out arms of
longing Even if Babette had been present she would only have smiled
her gay little smile and coquetted with him She could not understand
He had known of course from the first moment that she could not
understand And so why the ache ache ache of the heart Or WAS it the
heart or the brain or the soul

Sometimes when the evenings were so hot that he could not endure the
close air of the house he sat on the narrow dusty front porch and
looked about him at his neighbors The street had once been smart and
aspiring but it had fallen into decay and dejection Pale young men
with flurriedlooking wives seemed to Boyce to occupy most of the
houses Sometimes three or four couples would live in one house Most of
these appeared to be childless The women made a pretence at fashionable
dressing and wore their hair elaborately in fashions which somehow
suggested boardinghouses to Boyce though he could not have told why
Every house in the block needed fresh paint Lacking this renovation
the householders tried to make up for it by a display of lace curtains
which at every window swayed in the smokeweighted breeze Strips
of carpeting were laid down the front steps of the houses where the
communities of young couples lived and here evenings the inmates of
the houses gathered committing mild extravagances such as the treating
of each other to ginger ale or beer or icecream

Boyce watched these tawdry makeshifts at sociability with bitterness and
loathing He wondered how he could have been such a fool as to bring
his exquisite Babette to this neighborhood How could he expect that she
would return to him It was not reasonable He ought to go down on his
knees with gratitude that she even condescended to write him

Sitting one night till lateso late that the fashionable young wives
with their husbands had retired from the strips of stair carpetingand
raging at the loneliness which ate at his heart like a cancer he heard
softly creeping through the windows of the house adjoining his own the
sound of comfortable melody

It breathed upon his ear like a spirit of consolation speaking
of peace of love which needs no reward save its own sweetness of
aspiration which looks forever beyond the thing of the hour to find
attainment in that which is eternal So insidiously did it whisper these
things so delicately did the simple and perfect melodies creep upon the
spiritthat Boyce felt no resentment but from the first listened
as one who listens to learn or as one who fainting on the hot road
hears far in the ferny deeps below the gurgle of a spring

Then came harmonies more intricate fair fabrics of woven sound in
the midst of which gleamed golden threads of joy a tapestry of sound
multitinted gallant with story and achievement and beautiful things
Boyce sitting on his absurd piazza with his knees jambed against
the balustrade and his chair back against the duncolored wall of his
house seemed to be walking in the cathedral of the redwood forest
with blue above him a vast hymn in his ears pungent perfume in his
nostrils and mighty shafts of trees lifting themselves to heaven proud
and erect as pure men before their Judge He stood on a mountain at
sunrise and saw the marvels of the amethystine clouds below his feet
heard an eternal and white silence such as broods among the everlasting
snows and saw an eagle winging for the sun He was in a city and away
from him diverging like the spokes of a wheel ran thronging streets
and to his sense came the beat beat beat of the citys heart He saw
the golden alchemy of a chosen race saw greed transmitted to progress
saw that which had enslaved men work at last to their liberation heard
the roar of mighty mills and on the streets all the peoples of earth
walking with common purpose in fealty and understanding And then from
the swelling of this concourse of great sounds came a diminuendo calm
as philosophy and from that nothingness

Boyce sat still for a long time listening to the echoes which this
music had awakened in his soul He retired at length content
but determined that upon the morrow he would watchthe day being
Sundayfor the musician who had so moved and taught him

He arose early therefore and having prepared his own simple breakfast
of fruit and coffee took his station by the window to watch for the
man For he felt convinced that the exposition he had heard was that of
a masculine mind The long hot hours of the morning went by but the
front door of the house next to his did not open

These artists sleep late he complained Still he watched He was
too much afraid of losing him to go out for dinner By three in the
afternoon he had grown impatient He went to the house next door and
rang the bell There was no response He thundered another appeal An
old woman with a cloth about her head answered the door She was very
deaf and Boyce had difficulty in making himself understood

The family is in the country was all she would say The family will
not be home till September

But there is some one living here shouted Boyce

_I_ live here she said with dignity putting back a wisp of dirty
gray hair behind her ear It is my house I sublet to the family

What family

But the old creature was not communicative

The family that lives here she said

Then who plays the piano in this house roared Boyce Do you

He thought a shade of pallor showed itself on her ashcolored cheeks
Yet she smiled a little at the idea of her playing

There is no piano she said and she put an enigmatical emphasis to
the words

Nonsense cried Boyce indignantly I heard a piano being played in
this very house for hours last night

You may enter said the old woman with an accent more vicious than
hospitable

Boyce almost burst into the drawingroom It was a dusty and forbidding
place with ugly furniture and gaudy walls No piano nor any other
musical instrument stood in it The intruder turned an angry and baffled
face to the old woman who was smiling with illconcealed exultation

I shall see the other rooms he announced The old woman did not
appear to be surprised at his impertinence

As you please she said

So with the hobbling creature with her bandaged head for a guide he
explored every room of the house which being identical with his own he
could do without fear of leaving any apartment unentered But no piano
did he find

Explain roared Boyce at length turning upon the leering old hag
beside him Explain For surely I heard music more beautiful than I can
tell

I know nothing she said But it is true I once had a lodger who
rented the front room and that he played upon the piano I am poor at
hearing but he must have played well for all the neighbors used to
come in front of the house to listen and sometimes they applauded him
and sometimes they were still I could tell by watching their hands
Sometimes little children came and danced Other times young men and
women came and listened But the young man died The neighbors were
angry They came to look at him and said he had starved to death It was
no fault of mine I sold his piano to pay his funeral expensesand it
took every cent to pay for them too Id have you know But since then
sometimesstill it must be nonsense for I never heard itfolks say
that he plays the piano in my room It has kept me out of the letting of
it more than once But the family doesnt seem to mindthe family that
lives here you know They will be back in September Yes

Boyce left her nodding her thanks at what he had placed in her hand and
went home to write it all to BabetteBabette who would laugh so merrily
when she read it




AN ASTRAL ONION


WHEN Tig Braddock came to Nora Finnegan he was redheaded and freckled
and truth to tell he remained with these features to the end of his
lifea life prolonged by a lucky if somewhat improbable incident as
you shall hear

Tig had shuffled off his parents as saurians of some sorts do their
skins During the temporary absence from home of his mother who was at
the bridewell and the more extended vacation of his father who like
Villon loved the open road and the life of it Tig who was not a
welldomesticated animal wandered away The humane society never heard
of him the neighbors did not miss him and the law took no cognizance
of this detached citizenthis lost pleiad Tig would have sunk into
that melancholy which is attendant upon hungerthe only form of
despair which babyhood knowsif he had not wandered across the path of
Nora Finnegan Now Nora shone with steady brightness in her orbit
and no sooner had Tig entered her atmosphere than he was warmed and
comforted Hunger could not live where Nora was The basement room where
she kept house was redolent with savory smells and in the stove in her
front roomwhich was also her bedroomthere was a bright fire glowing
when fire was needed

Nora went out washing for a living But she was not a poor washerwoman
Not at all She was a washerwoman triumphant She had perfect health an
enormous frame an abounding enthusiasm for life and a rich abundance
of professional pride She believed herself to be the best washer of
white clothes she had ever had the pleasure of knowing and the value
placed upon her services and her long connection with certain families
with large weekly washings bore out this estimate of herselfan
estimate which she never endeavored to conceal

Nora had buried two husbands without being unduly depressed by the
fact The first husband had been a disappointment and Nora winked at
Providence when an accident in a tunnel carried him offthat is to
say carried the husband off The second husband was not so much of a
disappointment as a surprise He developed ability of a literary order
and wrote songs which sold and made him a small fortune Then he ran
away with another woman The woman spent his fortune drove him to
dissipation and when he was dying he came back to Nora who received
him cordially attended him to the end and cheered his last hours by
singing his own songs to him Then she raised a headstone recounting his
virtues which were quite numerous and refraining from any reference to
those peculiarities which had caused him to be such a surprise

Only one actual chagrin had ever nibbled at the sound heart of Nora
Finnegana cruel chagrin with long white teeth such as rodents have
She had never held a child to her breast nor laughed in its eyes never
bathed the pink form of a little son or daughter never felt a tugging
of tiny hands at her voluminous calico skirts Nora had burnt many
candles before the statue of the blessed Virgin without remedying this
deplorable condition She had sent up unavailing prayersshe had at
times wept hot tears of longing and loneliness Sometimes in her sleep
she dreamed that a wee form warm and exquisitely soft was pressed
against her firm body and that a hand with tiniest pink nails crept
within her bosom But as she reached out to snatch this delicious little
creature closer she woke to realize a barren womans grief and turned
herself in anguish on her lonely pillow

So when Tig came along accompanied by two curs who had faithfully
followed him from his home and when she learned the details of his
story she took him in curs and all and having bathed the three of
them made them part and parcel of her home This was after the demise
of the second husband and at a time when Nora felt that she had done
all a woman could be expected to do for Hymen

Tig was a preposterous baby The curs were preposterous curs Nora had
always been afflicted with a surplus amount of laughterlaughter which
had difficulty in attaching itself to anything owing to the lack of the
really comic in the surroundings of the poor But with a redheaded and
freckled baby boy and two trick dogs in the house she found a good and
sufficient excuse for her hilarity and would have torn the cave where
echo lies with her mirth had that cave not been at such an immeasurable
distance from the crowded neighborhood where she lived

At the age of four Tig went to free kindergarten at the age of six he
was in school and made three grades the first year and two the next At
fifteen he was graduated from the high school and went to work as
errand boy in a newspaper office with the fixed determination to make a
journalist of himself

Nora was a trifle worried about his morals when she discovered his
intellect but as time went on and Tig showed no devotion for any woman
save herself and no consciousness that there were such things as bad
boys or saloons in the world she began to have confidence All of his
earnings were brought to her Every holiday was spent with her He told
her his secrets and his aspirations He admitted that he expected to
become a great man and though he had not quite decided upon the nature
of his careersaving of course the makeshift of journalismit was
not unlikely that he would elect to be a novelist likewell probably
like Thackeray

Hope always a charming creature put on her most alluring smiles for
Tig and he made her his mistress and feasted on the light of her eyes
Moreover he was chaperoned so to speak by Nora Finnegan who listened
to every line Tig wrote and made a mighty applause and filled him up
with good Irish stew many colored as the coat of Joseph and pungent
with the inimitable perfume of the rose of the cellar Nora Finnegan
understood the onion and used it lovingly She perceived the difference
between the use and abuse of this pleasant and obvious friend of hungry
man and employed it with enthusiasm but discretion Thus it came
about that whoever ate of her dinners found the meals of other cooks
strangely lacking in savor and remembered with regret the soups
and stews the broiled steaks and stuffed chickens of the woman who
appreciated the onion

When Nora Finnegan came home with a cold one day she took it in such a
jocular fashion that Tig felt not the least concern about her and when
two days later she died of pneumonia he almost thought at first that
it must be one of her jokes She had departed with decision such as had
characterized every act of her life and had made as little trouble for
others as possible When she was dead the community had the opportunity
of discovering the number of her friends Miserable children with faces
which revealed two generations of hunger homeless boys with vicious
countenances miserable wrecks of humanity women with bloated faces
came to weep over Noras bier and to lay a flower there and to scuttle
away more abjectly lonely than even sin could make them If the cats
and the dogs the sparrows and horses to which she had shown kindness
could also have attended her funeral the procession would have been
from a point of numbers one of the most imposing the city had ever
known Tig used up all their savings to bury her and the next week by
some peculiar fatality he had a falling out with the night editor of
his paper and was discharged This sank deep into his sensitive
soul and he swore he would be an underling no longerwhich foolish
resolution was directly traceable to his hair the color of which it
will be recollected was red

Not being an underling he was obliged to make himself into something
else and he recurred passionately to his old idea of becoming a
novelist He settled down in Noras basement rooms went to work on
a battered typewriter did his own cooking and occasionally pawned
something to keep him in food The environment was calculated to further
impress him with the idea of his genius

A certain magazine offered an alluring prize for a short story and Tig
wrote one and rewrote it making alterations revisions annotations
and interlineations which would have reflected credit upon Honore
Balzac himself Then he wrought all together with splendid brevity and
dramatic forceTigs own wordsand mailed the same He was convinced
he would get the prize He was just as much convinced of it as Nora
Finnegan would have been if she had been with him

So he went about doing more fiction taking no especial care of himself
and wrapt in rosy dreams which not being warm enough for the weather
permitted him to come down with rheumatic fever

He lay alone in his room and suffered such torments as the condemned
and rheumatic know depending on one of Noras former friends to come in
twice a day and keep up the fire for him This friend was aged ten and
looked like a sparrow who had been in a cyclone but somewhere inside
his bones was a wit which had spelled out devotion He found fuel for
the cracked stove somehow or other He brought it in a dirty sack which
he carried on his back and he kept warmth in Tigs miserable body
Moreover he found food of a sortcold horrible bits often and Tig
wept when he saw them remembering the meals Nora had served him

Tig was getting better though he was conscious of a weak heart and a
lamenting stomach when to his amazement the Sparrow ceased to visit
him Not for a moment did Tig suspect desertion He knew that only
something in the nature of an act of Providence as the insurance
companies would designate it could keep the little bundle of bones away
from him As the days went by he became convinced of it for no Sparrow
came and no coal lay upon the hearth The basement window fortunately
looked toward the south and the pale April sunshine was beginning
to make itself felt so that the temperature of the room was not
unbearable But Tig languished sank sank day by day and was kept
alive only by the conviction that the letter announcing the award of the
thousanddollar prize would presently come to him One night he reached a
place where for hunger and dejection his mind wandered and he seemed
to be complaining all night to Nora of his woes When the chill dawn
came with chittering of little birds on the dirty pavement and an
agitation of the scrawny willow pussies he was not able to lift his
hand to his head The window before his sight was but a glimmering
square He said to himself that the end must be at hand Yet it was
cruel cruel with fame and fortune so near If only he had some food
he might summon strength to rallyjust for a little while Impossible
that he should die And yet without food there was no choice

Dreaming so of Noras dinners thinking how one spoonful of a stew such
as she often compounded would now be his salvation he became conscious
of the presence of a strong perfume in the room It was so familiar
that it seemed like a subconsciousness yet he found no name for this
friendly odor for a bewildered minute or two Little by little however
it grew upon him that it was the onionthat fragrant and kindly bulb
which had attained its apotheosis in the cuisine of Nora Finnegan of
sacred memory He opened his languid eyes to see if mayhap the plant
had not attained some more palpable materialization

Behold it was so Before him in a brown earthen disha most familiar
dishwas an onion pearly white in placid seas of gravy smoking and
delectable With unexpected strength he raised himself and reached for
the dish which floated before him in a halo made by its own steam It
moved toward him offered a spoon to his hand and as he ate he heard
about the room the rustle of Nora Finnegans starched skirts and now
and then a faint faint echo of her oldtime laughsuch an echo as one
may find of the sea in the heart of a shell

The noble bulb disappeared little by little before his voracity and in
contentment greater than virtue can give he sank back upon his pillow
and slept

Two hours later the postman knocked at the door and receiving no
answer forced his way in Tig half awake saw him enter with no
surprise He felt no surprise when he put a letter in his hand bearing
the name of the magazine to which he had sent his short story He was
not even surprised when tearing it open with suddenly alert hands he
found within the check for the first prizethe check he had expected

All that day as the April sunlight spread itself upon his floor he
felt his strength grow Late in the afternoon the Sparrow came back
paler and more bony than ever and sank breathing hard upon the
floor with his sack of coal

Ive been sick he said trying to smile Terrible sick but I come
as soon as I could

Build up the fire cried Tig in a voice so strong it made the Sparrow
start as if a stone had struck him Build up the fire and forget you
are sick For by the shade of Nora Finnegan you shall be hungry no
more





FROM THE LOOM OF THE DEAD


WHEN Urda Bjarnason tells a tale all the men stop their talking to
listen for they know her to be wise with the wisdom of the old people
and that she has more learning than can be got even from the great
schools at Reykjavik She is especially prized by them here in this
new country where the Icelandmen are settledthis America so new in
letters where the people speak foolishly and write unthinking books
So the men who know that it is given to the mothers of earth to be
very wise stop their six part singing or their jangles about the
freethinkers and give attentive ear when Urda Bjarnason lights her
pipe and begins her tale

She is very old Her daughters and sons are all dead but her
granddaughter who is most respectable and the cousin of a physician
says that Urda is twentyfour and a hundred and there are others who
say that she is older still She watches all that the Iceland people do
in the new land she knows about the building of the five villages on
the North Dakota plain and of the founding of the churches and the
schools and the tilling of the wheat farms She notes with suspicion
the actions of the women who bring home webs of cloth from the store
instead of spinning them as their mothers did before them and she
shakes her head at the wives who run to the village grocery store every
fortnight imitating the wasteful American women who throw butter in
the fire faster than it can be turned from the churn

She watches yet other things All winter long the white snows reach
across the gently rolling plains as far as the eye can behold In the
morning she sees them tinted pink at the east at noon she notes
golden lights flashing across them when the sky is graywhich is not
oftenshe notes that they grow as ashen as a face with the death shadow
on it Sometimes they glitter with silverlike tips of ocean waves But
at these things she looks only casually It is when the blue shadows
dance on the snow that she leaves her corner behind the iron stove and
stands before the window resting her two hands on the stout bar of her
cane and gazing out across the waste with eyes which age has restored
after four decades of decrepitude

The young Icelandmen say

Mother it is the clouds hurrying across the sky that make the dance of
the shadows

There are no clouds she replies and points to the jewellike blue of
the arching sky

It is the drifting air explains Fridrik Halldersson he who has
been in the Northern seas As the wind buffets the air it looks blue
against the white of the snow Tis the air that makes the dancing
shadows

But Urda shakes her head and points with her dried finger and
those who stand beside her see figures moving and airy shapes and
contortions of strange things such as are seen in a beryl stone

But Urda Bjarnason says Ingeborg Christianson the pert young wife
with the blueeyed twins why is it we see these things only when we
stand beside you and you help us to the sight

Because says the mother with a steelblue flash of her old eyes
having eyes ye will not see Then the men laugh They like to hear
Ingeborg worsted For did she not jilt two men from Gardar and one from
Mountain and another from Winnipeg

Not even Ingeborg can deny that Mother Urda tells true things

Today says Urda standing by the little window and watching the
dance of the shadows a child breathed thrice on a farm at the West
and then it died

The next week at the church gathering when all the sledges stopped
at the house of Urdas granddaughter they said it was sothat John
Christiansons wife Margaret never heard the voice of her son but that
he breathed thrice in his nurses arms and died

Three sledges run over the snow toward Milton says Urda all are
laden with wheat and in one is a stranger He has with him a strange
engine but its purpose I do not know

Six hours later the drivers of three empty sledges stop at the house

We have been to Milton with wheat they say and Christian Johnson
here carried a photographer from St Paul

Now it stands to reason that the farmers like to amuse themselves
through the silent and white winters And they prefer above all things
to talk or to listen as has been the fashion of their race for a
thousand years Among all the storytellers there is none like Urda for
she is the daughter and the granddaughter and the greatgranddaughter
of storytellers It is given to her to talk as it is given to John
Thorlaksson to singhe who sings so as his sledge flies over the snow
at night that the people come out in the bitter air from their doors to
listen and the dogs put up their noses and howl not liking music

In the little cabin of Peter Christianson the husband of Urdas
granddaughter it sometimes happens that twenty men will gather about
the stove They hang their bearskin coats on the wall put their fur
gauntlets underneath the stove where they will keep warm and then
stretch their stout feltcovered legs to the wood fire The room is
fetid the coffee steams eternally on the stove and from her chair in
the warmest corner Urda speaks out to the listening men who shake their
heads with joy as they hear the pure old Icelandic flow in sweet rhythm
from between her lips Among the many many tales she tells is that of
the dead weaver and she tells it in the simplest language in all
the worldlanguage so simple that even great scholars could find no
simpler and the children crawling on the floor can understand

Jon and Loa lived with their father and mother far to the north of the
Island of Fire and when the children looked from their windows they saw
only wild scaurs and jagged lava rocks and a distant deep gleam of the
sea They caught the shine of the sea through an eyeshaped opening in
the rocks and all the long night of winter it gleamed up at them like
the eye of a dead witch But when it sparkled and began to laugh the
children danced about the hut and sang for they knew the bright summer
time was at hand Then their father fished and their mother was gay
But it is true that even in the winter and the darkness they were happy
for they made fishing nets and baskets and cloth togetherJon and Loa
and their father and motherand the children were taught to read in
the books and were told the sagas and given instruction in the part
singing

They did not know there was such a thing as sorrow in the world for no
one had ever mentioned it to them But one day their mother died Then
they had to learn how to keep the fire on the hearth and to smoke the
fish and make the black coffee And also they had to learn how to live
when there is sorrow at the heart

They wept together at night for lack of their mothers kisses and in
the morning they were loath to rise because they could not see her face
The dead cold eye of the sea watching them from among the lava rocks
made them afraid so they hung a shawl over the window to keep it out
And the house try as they would did not look clean and cheerful as it
had used to do when their mother sang and worked about it

One day when a mist rested over the eye of the sea like that which
one beholds on the eyes of the blind a greater sorrow came to them for
a stepmother crossed the threshold She looked at Jon and Loa and made
complaint to their father that they were still very small and not likely
to be of much use After that they had to rise earlier than ever and to
work as only those who have their growth should work till their hearts
cracked for weariness and shame They had not much to eat for their
stepmother said she would trust to the gratitude of no other womans
child and that she believed in laying up against old age So she put
the few coins that came to the house in a strong box and bought little
food Neither did she buy the children clothes though those which their
dear mother had made for them were so worn that the warp stood apart
from the woof and there were holes at the elbows and little warmth to
be found in them anywhere

Moreover the quilts on their beds were too short for their growing
length so that at night either their purple feet or their thin
shoulders were uncovered and they wept for the cold and in the
morning when they crept into the larger room to build the fire they
were so stiff they could not stand straight and there was pain at their
joints

The wife scolded all the time and her brow was like a storm sweeping
down from the Northwest There was no peace to be had in the house
The children might not repeat to each other the sagas their mother had
taught them nor try their part singing nor make little doll cradles of
rushes Always they had to work always they were scolded always their
clothes grew thinner

Stepmother cried Loa one dayshe whom her mother had called the
little birdwe are acold because of our rags Our mother would have
woven blue cloth for us and made it into garments

Your mother is where she will weave no cloth said the stepmother
and she laughed many times

All in the cold and still of that night the stepmother wakened and
she knew not why She sat up in her bed and knew not why She knew not
why and she looked into the room and there by the light of a burning
fishs tailtwas such a light the folk used in those dayswas a
woman weaving She had no loom and shuttle she had none All with
her hands she wove a wondrous cloth Stooping and bending rising and
swaying with motions beautiful as those the Northern Lights make in a
midwinter sky she wove a cloth The warp was blue and mystical to see
the woof was white and shone with its whiteness so that of all the
webs the stepmother had ever seen she had seen none like to this

Yet the sight delighted her not for beyond the drifting web and
beyond the weaver she saw the room and furnitureaye saw them through
the body of the weaver and the drifting of the cloth Then she knewas
the haunted are made to knowthat twas the mother of the children come
to show her she could still weave cloth The heart of the stepmother was
cold as ice yet she could not move to waken her husband at her side
for her hands were as fixed as if they were crossed on her dead breast
The voice in her was silent and her tongue stood to the roof of her
mouth

After a time the wraith of the dead mother moved toward herthe wraith
of the weaver moved her wayand round and about her body was wound the
shining cloth Wherever it touched the body of the stepmother it was as
hateful to her as the touch of a monster out of seaslime so that her
flesh crept away from it and her senses swooned

In the early morning she awoke to the voices of the children
whispering in the inner room as they dressed with halffrozen fingers
Still about her was the hateful beautiful web filling her soul with
loathing and with fear She thought she saw the task set for her and
when the children crept in to light the firevery purple and thin were
their little bodies and the rags hung from themshe arose and held out
the shining cloth and cried

Here is the web your mother wove for you I will make it into
garments But even as she spoke the cloth faded and fell into
nothingness and the children cried

Stepmother you have the fever

And then

Stepmother what makes the strange light in the room

That day the stepmother was too weak to rise from her bed and the
children thought she must be going to die for she did not scold as they
cleared the house and braided their baskets and she did not frown at
them but looked at them with wistful eyes

By fall of night she was as weary as if she had wept all the day and
so she slept But again she was awakened and knew not why And again
she sat up in her bed and knew not why And again not knowing why she
looked and saw a woman weaving cloth All that had happened the night
before happened this night Then when the morning came and the
children crept in shivering from their beds she arose and dressed
herself and from her strong box she took coins and bade her husband go
with her to the town

So that night a web of cloth woven by one of the best weavers in all
Iceland was in the house and on the beds of the children were blankets
of lambs wool soft to the touch and fair to the eye After that the
children slept warm and were at peace for now when they told the sagas
their mother had taught them or tried their part songs as they sat
together on their bench the stepmother was silent For she feared
to chide lest she should wake at night not knowing why and see the
mothers wraith




A GRAMMATICAL GHOST


THERE was only one possible objection to the drawingroom and that was
the occasional presence of Miss Carew and only one possible objection
to Miss Carew And that was that she was dead

She had been dead twenty years as a matter of fact and record and to
the last of her life sacredly preserved the treasures and traditions of
her family a family bound upas it is quite unnecessary to explain to
any one in good societywith all that is most venerable and heroic in
the history of the Republic Miss Carew never relaxed the
proverbial hospitality of her house even when she remained its sole
representative She continued to preside at her table with dignity and
state and to set an example of excessive modesty and gentle decorum to
a generation of restless young women

It is not likely that having lived a life of such irreproachable
gentility as this Miss Carew would have the bad taste to die in any way
not pleasant to mention in fastidious society She could be trusted to
the last not to outrage those friends who quoted her as an exemplar of
propriety She died very unobtrusively of an affection of the heart one
June morning while trimming her rose trellis and her lavendercolored
print was not even rumpled when she fell nor were more than the tips of
her little bronze slippers visible

Isnt it dreadful said the Philadelphians that the property should
go to a very very distant cousin in Iowa or somewhere else on the
frontier about whom nobody knows anything at all

The Carew treasures were packed in boxes and sent away into the Iowa
wilderness the Carew traditions were preserved by the Historical
Society the Carew property standing in one of the most umbrageous
and aristocratic suburbs of Philadelphia was rented to all manner
of folkanybody who had money enough to pay the rentaland society
entered its doors no more

But at last after twenty years and when all save the oldest
Philadelphians had forgotten Miss Lydia Carew the very very distant
cousin appeared He was quite in the prime of life and so agreeable and
unassuming that nothing could be urged against him save his patronymic
which being Boggs did not commend itself to the euphemists With him
were two maiden sisters ladies of excellent taste and manners who
restored the Carew china to its ancient cabinets and replaced the Carew
pictures upon the walls with additions not out of keeping with
the elegance of these heirlooms Society with a magnanimity almost
dramatic overlooked the name of Boggsand called

All was well At least to an outsider all seemed to be well But
in truth there was a certain distress in the old mansion and in
the hearts of the wellbehaved Misses Boggs It came about most
unexpectedly The sisters had been sitting upstairs looking out at the
beautiful grounds of the old place and marvelling at the violets
which lifted their heads from every possible cranny about the house and
talking over the cordiality which they had been receiving by those upon
whom they had no claim and they were filled with amiable satisfaction
Life looked attractive They had often been grateful to Miss Lydia Carew
for leaving their brother her fortune Now they felt even more grateful
to her She had left them a Social Positionone which even after
twenty years of desuetude was fit for use

They descended the stairs together with arms clasped about each others
waists and as they did so presented a placid and pleasing sight They
entered their drawingroom with the intention of brewing a cup of tea
and drinking it in calm sociability in the twilight But as they entered
the room they became aware of the presence of a lady who was already
seated at their teatable regarding their old Wedgewood with the air of
a connoisseur

There were a number of peculiarities about this intruder To begin with
she was hatless quite as if she were a habitue of the house and
was costumed in a prim lilaccolored lawn of the style of two decades
past But a greater peculiarity was the resemblance this lady bore to a
faded daguerrotype If looked at one way she was perfectly discernible
if looked at another she went out in a sort of blur Notwithstanding
this comparative invisibility she exhaled a delicate perfume of sweet
lavender very pleasing to the nostrils of the Misses Boggs who stood
looking at her in gentle and unprotesting surprise

I beg your pardon began Miss Prudence the younger of the Misses
Boggs but

But at this moment the Daguerrotype became a blur and Miss Prudence
found herself addressing space The Misses Boggs were irritated They
had never encountered any mysteries in Iowa They began an impatient
search behind doors and portieres and even under sofas though
it was quite absurd to suppose that a lady recognizing the merits of the
Carew Wedgewood would so far forget herself as to crawl under a sofa

When they had given up all hope of discovering the intruder they saw
her standing at the far end of the drawingroom critically examining a
watercolor marine The elder Miss Boggs started toward her with stern
decision but the little Daguerrotype turned with a shadowy smile
became a blur and an imperceptibility

Miss Boggs looked at Miss Prudence Boggs

If there were ghosts she said this would be one

If there were ghosts said Miss Prudence Boggs this would be the
ghost of Lydia Carew

The twilight was settling into blackness and Miss Boggs nervously lit
the gas while Miss Prudence ran for other teacups preferring for
reasons superfluous to mention not to drink out of the Carew china that
evening

The next day on taking up her embroidery frame Miss Boggs found a
number of oldfashioned crossstitches added to her Kensington Prudence
she knew would never have degraded herself by taking a crossstitch
and the parlormaid was above taking such a liberty Miss Boggs
mentioned the incident that night at a dinner given by an ancient friend
of the Carews

Oh thats the work of Lydia Carew without a doubt cried the
hostess She visits every new family that moves to the house but she
never remains more than a week or two with any one

It must be that she disapproves of them suggested Miss Boggs

I think thats it said the hostess She doesnt like their china or
their fiction

I hope shell disapprove of us added Miss Prudence

The hostess belonged to a very old Philadelphian family and she shook
her head

I should say it was a compliment for even the ghost of Miss Lydia Carew
to approve of one she said severely

The next morning when the sisters entered their drawingroom there were
numerous evidences of an occupant during their absence The sofa pillows
had been rearranged so that the effect of their grouping was less
bizarre than that favored by the Western women a horrid little Buddhist
idol with its eyes fixed on its abdomen had been chastely hidden behind
a Dresden shepherdess as unfit for the scrutiny of polite eyes and
on the table where Miss Prudence did work in water colors after the
fashion of the impressionists lay a prim and impossible composition
representing a mossrose and a number of heartsease colored with that
caution which modest spinster artists instinctively exercise

Oh theres no doubt its the work of Miss Lydia Carew said Miss
Prudence contemptuously Theres no mistaking the drawing of that
rigid little rose Dont you remember those wreaths and bouquets framed
among the pictures we got when the Carew pictures were sent to us I
gave some of them to an orphan asylum and burned up the rest

Hush cried Miss Boggs involuntarily If she heard you it would
hurt her feelings terribly Of course I mean and she blushed It
might hurt her feelingsbut how perfectly ridiculous Its impossible

Miss Prudence held up the sketch of the mossrose

THAT may be impossible in an artistic sense but it is a palpable
thing

Bosh cried Miss Boggs

But protested Miss Prudence how do you explain it

I dont said Miss Boggs and left the room

That evening the sisters made a point of being in the drawingroom
before the dusk came on and of lighting the gas at the first hint of
twilight They didnt believe in Miss Lydia Carewbut still they meant
to be beforehand with her They talked with unwonted vivacity and in
a louder tone than was their custom But as they drank their tea even
their utmost verbosity could not make them oblivious to the fact that
the perfume of sweet lavender was stealing insidiously through the room
They tacitly refused to recognize this odor and all that it indicated
when suddenly with a sharp crash one of the old Carew teacups
fell from the teatable to the floor and was broken The disaster was
followed by what sounded like a sigh of pain and dismay

I didnt suppose Miss Lydia Carew would ever be as awkward as that
cried the younger Miss Boggs petulantly

Prudence said her sister with a stern accent please try not to be a
fool You brushed the cup off with the sleeve of your dress

Your theory wouldnt be so bad said Miss Prudence half laughing and
half crying if there were any sleeves to my dress but as you see
there arent and then Miss Prudence had something as near hysterics as
a healthy young woman from the West can have

I wouldnt think such a perfect lady as Lydia Carew she ejaculated
between her sobs would make herself so disagreeable You may
talk about goodbreeding all you please but I call such intrusion
exceedingly bad taste I have a horrible idea that she likes us and
means to stay with us She left those other people because she did not
approve of their habits or their grammar It would be just our luck to
please her

Well I like your egotism said Miss Boggs

However the view Miss Prudence took of the case appeared to be the
right one Time went by and Miss Lydia Carew still remained When the
ladies entered their drawingroom they would see the little ladylike
Daguerrotype revolving itself into a blur before one of the family
portraits Or they noticed that the yellow sofa cushion toward which
she appeared to feel a peculiar antipathy had been dropped behind the
sofa upon the floor or that one of Jane Austens novels which none of
the family ever read had been removed from the book shelves and left
open upon the table

I cannot become reconciled to it complained Miss Boggs to Miss
Prudence I wish we had remained in Iowa where we belong Of course I
dont believe in the thing No sensible person would But still I cannot
become reconciled

But their liberation was to come and in a most unexpected manner

A relative by marriage visited them from the West He was a friendly
man and had much to say so he talked all through dinner and afterward
followed the ladies to the drawingroom to finish his gossip The gas in
the room was turned very low and as they entered Miss Prudence caught
sight of Miss Carew in company attire sitting in upright propriety in
a stiffbacked chair at the extremity of the apartment

Miss Prudence had a sudden idea

We will not turn up the gas she said with an emphasis intended to
convey private information to her sister It will be more agreeable to
sit here and talk in this soft light

Neither her brother nor the man from the West made any objection Miss
Boggs and Miss Prudence clasping each others hands divided their
attention between their corporeal and their incorporeal guests Miss
Boggs was confident that her sister had an idea and was willing to
await its development As the guest from Iowa spoke Miss Carew bent a
politely attentive ear to what he said

Ever since Richards took sick that time he said briskly it seemed
like he shed all responsibility The Misses Boggs saw the Daguerrotype
put up her shadowy head with a movement of doubt and apprehension The
fact of the matter was Richards didnt seem to scarcely get on the way
he might have been expected to At this conscienceless split to the
infinitive and misplacing of the preposition Miss Carew arose trembling
perceptibly I saw it wasnt no use for him to count on a quick
recovery

The Misses Boggs lost the rest of the sentence for at the utterance of
the double negative Miss Lydia Carew had flashed out not in a blur but
with mortal haste as when life goes out at a pistol shot

The man from the West wondered why Miss Prudence should have cried at so
pathetic a part of his story

Thank Goodness

And their brother was amazed to see Miss Boggs kiss Miss Prudence with
passion and energy

It was the end Miss Carew returned no more

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
