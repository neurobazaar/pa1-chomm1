THE TOYS OF PEACE


Harvey said Eleanor Bope handing her brother a cutting from a London
morning paper of the 19th of March just read this about childrens
toys please it exactly carries out some of our ideas about influence
and upbringing

In the view of the National Peace Council ran the extract there are
grave objections to presenting our boys with regiments of fighting men
batteries of guns and squadrons of Dreadnoughts Boys the Council
admits naturally love fighting and all the panoply of war    but that
is no reason for encouraging and perhaps giving permanent form to their
primitive instincts At the Childrens Welfare Exhibition which opens
at Olympia in three weeks time the Peace Council will make an
alternative suggestion to parents in the shape of an exhibition of peace
toys In front of a speciallypainted representation of the Peace
Palace at The Hague will be grouped not miniature soldiers but miniature
civilians not guns but ploughs and the tools of industry    It is
hoped that manufacturers may take a hint from the exhibit which will
bear fruit in the toy shops

The idea is certainly an interesting and very wellmeaning one said
Harvey whether it would succeed well in practice

We must try interrupted his sister you are coming down to us at
Easter and you always bring the boys some toys so that will be an
excellent opportunity for you to inaugurate the new experiment Go about
in the shops and buy any little toys and models that have special bearing
on civilian life in its more peaceful aspects Of course you must
explain the toys to the children and interest them in the new idea I
regret to say that the Siege of Adrianople toy that their Aunt Susan
sent them didnt need any explanation they knew all the uniforms and
flags and even the names of the respective commanders and when I heard
them one day using what seemed to be the most objectionable language they
said it was Bulgarian words of command of course it _may_ have been but
at any rate I took the toy away from them Now I shall expect your
Easter gifts to give quite a new impulse and direction to the childrens
minds Eric is not eleven yet and Bertie is only nineandahalf so
they are really at a most impressionable age

There is primitive instinct to be taken into consideration you know
said Harvey doubtfully and hereditary tendencies as well One of their
greatuncles fought in the most intolerant fashion at Inkermanhe was
specially mentioned in dispatches I believeand their greatgrandfather
smashed all his Whig neighbours hot houses when the great Reform Bill
was passed Still as you say they are at an impressionable age I
will do my best

On Easter Saturday Harvey Bope unpacked a large promisinglooking red
cardboard box under the expectant eyes of his nephews Your uncle has
brought you the newest thing in toys Eleanor had said impressively and
youthful anticipation had been anxiously divided between Albanian
soldiery and a Somali camelcorps Eric was hotly in favour of the
latter contingency There would be Arabs on horseback he whispered
the Albanians have got jolly uniforms and they fight all day long and
all night too when theres a moon but the countrys rocky so theyve
got no cavalry

A quantity of crinkly paper shavings was the first thing that met the
view when the lid was removed the most exiting toys always began like
that Harvey pushed back the top layer and drew forth a square rather
featureless building

Its a fort exclaimed Bertie

It isnt its the palace of the Mpret of Albania said Eric immensely
proud of his knowledge of the exotic title its got no windows you
see so that passersby cant fire in at the Royal Family

Its a municipal dustbin said Harvey hurriedly you see all the
refuse and litter of a town is collected there instead of lying about
and injuring the health of the citizens

In an awful silence he disinterred a little lead figure of a man in black
clothes

That he said is a distinguished civilian John Stuart Mill He was
an authority on political economy

Why asked Bertie

Well he wanted to be he thought it was a useful thing to be

Bertie gave an expressive grunt which conveyed his opinion that there
was no accounting for tastes

Another square building came out this time with windows and chimneys

A model of the Manchester branch of the Young Womens Christian
Association said Harvey

Are there any lions asked Eric hopefully He had been reading Roman
history and thought that where you found Christians you might reasonably
expect to find a few lions

There are no lions said Harvey Here is another civilian Robert
Raikes the founder of Sunday schools and here is a model of a municipal
washhouse These little round things are loaves baked in a sanitary
bakehouse That lead figure is a sanitary inspector this one is a
district councillor and this one is an official of the Local Government
Board

What does he do asked Eric wearily

He sees to things connected with his Department said Harvey This
box with a slit in it is a ballotbox Votes are put into it at election
times

What is put into it at other times asked Bertie

Nothing And here are some tools of industry a wheelbarrow and a hoe
and I think these are meant for hoppoles This is a model beehive and
that is a ventilator for ventilating sewers This seems to be another
municipal dustbinno it is a model of a school of art and public
library This little lead figure is Mrs Hemans a poetess and this is
Rowland Hill who introduced the system of penny postage This is Sir
John Herschel the eminent astrologer

Are we to play with these civilian figures asked Eric

Of course said Harvey these are toys they are meant to be played
with

But how

It was rather a poser You might make two of them contest a seat in
Parliament said Harvey an have an election

With rotten eggs and free fights and ever so many broken heads
exclaimed Eric

And noses all bleeding and everybody drunk as can be echoed Bertie
who had carefully studied one of Hogarths pictures

Nothing of the kind said Harvey nothing in the least like that
Votes will be put in the ballotbox and the Mayor will count themand
he will say which has received the most votes and then the two
candidates will thank him for presiding and each will say that the
contest has been conducted throughout in the pleasantest and most
straightforward fashion and they part with expressions of mutual esteem
Theres a jolly game for you boys to play I never had such toys when I
was young

I dont think well play with them just now said Eric with an entire
absence of the enthusiasm that his uncle had shown I think perhaps we
ought to do a little of our holiday task Its history this time weve
got to learn up something about the Bourbon period in France

The Bourbon period said Harvey with some disapproval in his voice

Weve got to know something about Louis the Fourteenth continued Eric
Ive learnt the names of all the principal battles already

This would never do There were of course some battles fought during
his reign said Harvey but I fancy the accounts of them were much
exaggerated news was very unreliable in those days and there were
practically no war correspondents so generals and commanders could
magnify every little skirmish they engaged in till they reached the
proportions of decisive battles Louis was really famous now as a
landscape gardener the way he laid out Versailles was so much admired
that it was copied all over Europe

Do you know anything about Madame Du Barry asked Eric didnt she
have her head chopped off

She was another great lover of gardening said Harvey evasively in
fact I believe the well known rose Du Barry was named after her and now
I think you had better play for a little and leave your lessons till
later

Harvey retreated to the library and spent some thirty or forty minutes in
wondering whether it would be possible to compile a history for use in
elementary schools in which there should be no prominent mention of
battles massacres murderous intrigues and violent deaths The York
and Lancaster period and the Napoleonic era would he admitted to
himself present considerable difficulties and the Thirty Years War
would entail something of a gap if you left it out altogether Still it
would be something gained if at a highly impressionable age children
could be got to fix their attention on the invention of calico printing
instead of the Spanish Armada or the Battle of Waterloo

It was time he thought to go back to the boys room and see how they
were getting on with their peace toys As he stood outside the door he
could hear Erics voice raised in command Bertie chimed in now and again
with a helpful suggestion

That is Louis the Fourteenth Eric was saying that one in
kneebreeches that Uncle said invented Sunday schools It isnt a bit
like him but itll have to do

Well give him a purple coat from my paintbox by and by said Bertie

Yes an red heels That is Madame de Maintenon that one he called
Mrs Hemans She begs Louis not to go on this expedition but he turns a
deaf ear He takes Marshal Saxe with him and we must pretend that they
have thousands of men with them The watchword is _Qui vive_ and the
answer is _Letat cest moi_that was one of his favourite remarks you
know They land at Manchester in the dead of the night and a Jacobite
conspirator gives them the keys of the fortress

Peeping in through the doorway Harvey observed that the municipal dust
bin had been pierced with holes to accommodate the muzzles of imaginary
cannon and now represented the principal fortified position in
Manchester John Stuart Mill had been dipped in red ink and apparently
stood for Marshal Saxe

Louis orders his troops to surround the Young Womens Christian
Association and seize the lot of them Once back at the Louvre and the
girls are mine he exclaims We must use Mrs Hemans again for one of
the girls she says Never and stabs Marshal Saxe to the heart

He bleeds dreadfully exclaimed Bertie splashing red ink liberally
over the facade of the Association building

The soldiers rush in and avenge his death with the utmost savagery A
hundred girls are killedhere Bertie emptied the remainder of the red
ink over the devoted buildingand the surviving five hundred are
dragged off to the French ships I have lost a Marshal says Louis
but I do not go back emptyhanded

Harvey stole away from the room and sought out his sister

Eleanor he said the experiment

Yes

Has failed We have begun too late




LOUISE


The tea will be quite cold youd better ring for some more said the
Dowager Lady Beanford

Susan Lady Beanford was a vigorous old woman who had coquetted with
imaginary illhealth for the greater part of a lifetime Clovis Sangrail
irreverently declared that she had caught a chill at the Coronation of
Queen Victoria and had never let it go again Her sister Jane
Thropplestance who was some years her junior was chiefly remarkable for
being the most absentminded woman in Middlesex

Ive really been unusually clever this afternoon she remarked gaily
as she rang for the tea Ive called on all the people I meant to call
on and Ive done all the shopping that I set out to do I even
remembered to try and match that silk for you at Harrods but Id
forgotten to bring the pattern with me so it was no use I really think
that was the only important thing I forgot during the whole afternoon
Quite wonderful for me isnt it

What have you done with Louise asked her sister Didnt you take her
out with you You said you were going to

Good gracious exclaimed Jane what have I done with Louise I must
have left her somewhere

But where

Thats just it Where have I left her I cant remember if the
Carrywoods were at home or if I just left cards If there were at home I
may have left Louise there to play bridge Ill go and telephone to Lord
Carrywood and find out

Is that you Lord Carrywood she queried over the telephone its me
Jane Thropplestance I want to know have you seen Louise

Louise came the answer its been my fate to see it three times At
first I must admit I wasnt impressed by it but the music grows on one
after a bit Still I dont think I want to see it again just at
present Were you going to offer me a seat in your box

Not the opera Louisemy niece Louise Thropplestance I thought I
might have left her at your house

You left cards on us this afternoon I understand but I dont think you
left a niece The footman would have been sure to have mentioned it if
you had Is it going to be a fashion to leave nieces on people as well
as cards I hope not some of these houses in Berkeleysquare have
practically no accommodation for that sort of thing

Shes not at the Carrywoods announced Jane returning to her tea
now I come to think of it perhaps I left her at the silk counter at
Selfridges I may have told her to wait there a moment while I went to
look at the silks in a better light and I may easily have forgotten
about her when Ifound I hadnt your pattern with me In that case shes
still sitting there She wouldnt move unless she was told to Louise
has no initiative

You said you tried to match the silk at Harrods interjected the
dowager

Did I Perhaps it was Harrods I really dont remember It was one
of those places where every one is so kind and sympathetic and devoted
that one almost hates to take even a reel of cotton away from such
pleasant surroundings

I think you might have taken Louise away I dont like the idea of her
being there among a lot of strangers Supposing some unprincipled person
was to get into conversation with her

Impossible Louise has no conversation Ive never discovered a single
topic on which shed anything to say beyond Do you think so I dare say
youre right I really thought her reticence about the fall of the
Ribot Ministry was ridiculous considering how much her dear mother used
to visit Paris This bread and butter is cut far too thin it crumbles
away long before you can get it to your mouth One feels so absurd
snapping at ones food in midair like a trout leaping at mayfly

I am rather surprised said the dowager that you can sit there making
a hearty tea when youve just lost a favourite niece

You talk as if Id lost her in a churchyard sense instead of having
temporarily mislaid her Im sure to remember presently where I left
her

You didnt visit any place of devotion did you If youve left her
mooning about Westminster Abbey or St Peters Eaton Square without
being able to give any satisfactory reason why shes there shell be
seized under the Cat and Mouse Act and sent to Reginald McKenna

That would be extremely awkward said Jane meeting an irresolute piece
of bread and butter halfway we hardly know the McKennas and it would
be very tiresome having to telephone to some unsympathetic private
secretary describing Louise to him and asking to have her sent back in
time for dinner Fortunately I didnt go to any place of devotion
though I did get mixed up with a Salvation Army procession It was quite
interesting to be at close quarters with them theyre so absolutely
different to what they used to be when I first remember them in the
eighties They used to go about then unkempt and dishevelled in a sort
of smiling rage with the world and now theyre spruce and jaunty and
flamboyantly decorative like a geranium bed with religious convictions
Laura Kettleway was going on about them in the lift of the Dover Street
Tube the other day saying what a lot of good work they did and what a
loss it would have been if theyd never existed If they had never
existed I said Granville Barker would have been certain to have
invented something that looked exactly like them If you say things
like that quite loud in a Tube lift they always sound like epigrams

I think you ought to do something about Louise said the dowager

Im trying to think whether she was with me when I called on Ada
Spelvexit I rather enjoyed myself there Ada was trying as usual to
ram that odious Koriatoffski woman down my throat knowing perfectly well
that I detest her and in an unguarded moment she said Shes leaving
her present house and going to Lower Seymour Street I dare say she
will if she stays there long enough I said Ada didnt see it for
about three minutes and then she was positively uncivil No I am
certain I didnt leave Louise there

If you could manage to remember where you _did_ leave her it would be
more to the point than these negative assurances said Lady Beanford
so far all we know is that she is not at the Carrywoods or Ada
Spelvexits or Westminster Abbey

That narrows the search down a bit said Jane hopefully I rather
fancy she must have been with me when I went to Mornays I know I went
to Mornays because I remember meeting that delightful Malcolm Whats
hisname thereyou know whom I mean Thats the great advantage of
people having unusual first names you neednt try and remember what
their other name is Of course I know one or two other Malcolms but
none that could possibly be described as delightful He gave me two
tickets for the Happy Sunday Evenings in Sloane Square Ive probably
left them at Mornays but still it was awfully kind of him to give them
to me

Do you think you left Louise there

I might telephone and ask Oh Robert before you clear the teathings
away I wish youd ring up Mornays in Regent Street and ask if I left
two theatre tickets and one niece in their shop this afternoon

A niece maam asked the footman

Yes Miss Louise didnt come home with me and Im not sure where I left
her

Miss Louise has been upstairs all the afternoon maam reading to the
second kitchenmaid who has the neuralgia I took up tea to Miss Louise
at a quarter to five oclock maam

Of course how silly of me I remember now I asked her to read the
_Faerie Queene_ to poor Emma to try to send her to sleep I always get
some one to read the _Faerie Queene_ to me when I have neuralgia and it
usually sends me to sleep Louise doesnt seem to have been successful
but one cant say she hasnt tried I expect after the first hour or so
the kitchenmaid would rather have been left alone with her neuralgia but
of course Louise wouldnt leave off till some one told her to Anyhow
you can ring up Mornays Robert and ask whether I left two theatre
tickets there Except for your silk Susan those seem to be the only
things Ive forgotten this afternoon Quite wonderful for me




TEA


James CushatPrinkly was a young man who had always had a settled
conviction that one of these days he would marry up to the age of thirty
four he had done nothing to justify that conviction He liked and
admired a great many women collectively and dispassionately without
singling out one for especial matrimonial consideration just as one
might admire the Alps without feeling that one wanted any particular peak
as ones own private property His lack of initiative in this matter
aroused a certain amount of impatience among the sentimentallyminded
womenfolk of his home circle his mother his sisters an
auntinresidence and two or three intimate matronly friends regarded
his dilatory approach to the married state with a disapproval that was
far from being inarticulate His most innocent flirtations were watched
with the straining eagerness which a group of unexercised terriers
concentrates on the slightest movements of a human being who may be
reasonably considered likely to take them for a walk No decentsouled
mortal can long resist the pleading of several pairs of walkbeseeching
dogeyes James CushatPrinkly was not sufficiently obstinate or
indifferent to home influences to disregard the obviously expressed wish
of his family that he should become enamoured of some nice marriageable
girl and when his Uncle Jules departed this life and bequeathed him a
comfortable little legacy it really seemed the correct thing to do to set
about discovering some one to share it with him The process of
discovery was carried on more by the force of suggestion and the weight
of public opinion than by any initiative of his own a clear working
majority of his female relatives and the aforesaid matronly friends had
pitched on Joan Sebastable as the most suitable young woman in his range
of acquaintance to whom he might propose marriage and James became
gradually accustomed to the idea that he and Joan would go together
through the prescribed stages of congratulations presentreceiving
Norwegian or Mediterranean hotels and eventual domesticity It was
necessary however to ask the lady what she thought about the matter the
family had so far conducted and directed the flirtation with ability and
discretion but the actual proposal would have to be an individual
effort

CushatPrinkly walked across the Park towards the Sebastable residence in
a frame of mind that was moderately complacent As the thing was going
to be done he was glad to feel that he was going to get it settled and
off his mind that afternoon Proposing marriage even to a nice girl
like Joan was a rather irksome business but one could not have a
honeymoon in Minorca and a subsequent life of married happiness without
such preliminary He wondered what Minorca was really like as a place to
stop in in his minds eye it was an island in perpetual halfmourning
with black or white Minorca hens running all over it Probably it would
not be a bit like that when one came to examine it People who had been
in Russia had told him that they did not remember having seen any Muscovy
ducks there so it was possible that there would be no Minorca fowls on
the island

His Mediterranean musings were interrupted by the sound of a clock
striking the halfhour Halfpast four A frown of dissatisfaction
settled on his face He would arrive at the Sebastable mansion just at
the hour of afternoon tea Joan would be seated at a low table spread
with an array of silver kettles and creamjugs and delicate porcelain tea
cups behind which her voice would tinkle pleasantly in a series of
little friendly questions about weak or strong tea how much if any
sugar milk cream and so forth Is it one lump I forgot You do
take milk dont you Would you like some more hot water if its too
strong

CushatPrinkly had read of such things in scores of novels and hundreds
of actual experiences had told him that they were true to life Thousands
of women at this solemn afternoon hour were sitting behind dainty
porcelain and silver fittings with their voices tinkling pleasantly in a
cascade of solicitous little questions CushatPrinkly detested the
whole system of afternoon tea According to his theory of life a woman
should lie on a divan or couch talking with incomparable charm or
looking unutterable thoughts or merely silent as a thing to be looked
on and from behind a silken curtain a small Nubian page should silently
bring in a tray with cups and dainties to be accepted silently as a
matter of course without drawnout chatter about cream and sugar and hot
water If ones soul was really enslaved at ones mistresss feet how
could one talk coherently about weakened tea CushatPrinkly had never
expounded his views on the subject to his mother all her life she had
been accustomed to tinkle pleasantly at teatime behind dainty porcelain
and silver and if he had spoken to her about divans and Nubian pages she
would have urged him to take a weeks holiday at the seaside Now as he
passed through a tangle of small streets that led indirectly to the
elegant Mayfair terrace for which he was bound a horror at the idea of
confronting Joan Sebastable at her teatable seized on him A momentary
deliverance presented itself on one floor of a narrow little house at
the noisier end of Esquimault Street lived Rhoda Ellam a sort of remote
cousin who made a living by creating hats out of costly materials The
hats really looked as if they had come from Paris the cheques she got
for them unfortunately never looked as if they were going to Paris
However Rhoda appeared to find life amusing and to have a fairly good
time in spite of her straitened circumstances CushatPrinkly decided to
climb up to her floor and defer by halfanhour or so the important
business which lay before him by spinning out his visit he could
contrive to reach the Sebastable mansion after the last vestiges of
dainty porcelain had been cleared away

Rhoda welcomed him into a room that seemed to do duty as workshop
sittingroom and kitchen combined and to be wonderfully clean and
comfortable at the same time

Im having a picnic meal she announced Theres caviare in that jar
at your elbow Begin on that brown breadandbutter while I cut some
more Find yourself a cup the teapot is behind you Now tell me about
hundreds of things

She made no other allusion to food but talked amusingly and made her
visitor talk amusingly too At the same time she cut the
breadandbutter with a masterly skill and produced red pepper and sliced
lemon where so many women would merely have produced reasons and regrets
for not having any CushatPrinkly found that he was enjoying an
excellent tea without having to answer as many questions about it as a
Minister for Agriculture might be called on to reply to during an
outbreak of cattle plague

And now tell me why you have come to see me said Rhoda suddenly You
arouse not merely my curiosity but my business instincts I hope youve
come about hats I heard that you had come into a legacy the other day
and of course it struck me that it would be a beautiful and desirable
thing for you to celebrate the event by buying brilliantly expensive hats
for all your sisters They may not have said anything about it but I
feel sure the same idea has occurred to them Of course with Goodwood
on us I am rather rushed just now but in my business were accustomed
to that we live in a series of rusheslike the infant Moses

I didnt come about hats said her visitor In fact I dont think I
really came about anything I was passing and I just thought Id look in
and see you Since Ive been sitting talking to you however rather
important idea has occurred to me If youll forget Goodwood for a
moment and listen to me Ill tell you what it is

Some forty minutes later James CushatPrinkly returned to the bosom of
his family bearing an important piece of news

Im engaged to be married he announced

A rapturous outbreak of congratulation and selfapplause broke out

Ah we knew We saw it coming We foretold it weeks ago

Ill bet you didnt said CushatPrinkly If any one had told me at
lunchtime today that I was going to ask Rhoda Ellam to marry me and
that she was going to accept me I would have laughed at the idea

The romantic suddenness of the affair in some measure compensated Jamess
womenfolk for the ruthless negation of all their patient effort and
skilled diplomacy It was rather trying to have to deflect their
enthusiasm at a moments notice from Joan Sebastable to Rhoda Ellam but
after all it was Jamess wife who was in question and his tastes had
some claim to be considered

On a September afternoon of the same year after the honeymoon in Minorca
had ended CushatPrinkly came into the drawingroom of his new house in
Granchester Square Rhoda was seated at a low table behind a service of
dainty porcelain and gleaming silver There was a pleasant tinkling note
in her voice as she handed him a cup

You like it weaker than that dont you Shall I put some more hot
water to it No




THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CRISPINA UMBERLEIGH


In a firstclass carriage of a train speeding Balkanward across the flat
green Hungarian plain two Britons sat in friendly fitful converse They
had first foregathered in the cold grey dawn at the frontier line where
the presiding eagle takes on an extra head and Teuton lands pass from
Hohenzollern to Habsburg keepingand where a probing official beak
requires to delve in polite and perhaps perfunctory but always tiresome
manner into the baggage of sleephungry passengers After a days break
of their journey at Vienna the travellers had again foregathered at the
trainside and paid one another the compliment of settling instinctively
into the same carriage The elder of the two had the appearance and
manner of a diplomat in point of fact he was the wellconnected foster
brother of a wine business The other was certainly a journalist
Neither man was talkative and each was grateful to the other for not
being talkative That is why from time to time they talked

One topic of conversation naturally thrust itself forward in front of all
others In Vienna the previous day they had learned of the mysterious
vanishing of a worldfamous picture from the walls of the Louvre

A dramatic disappearance of that sort is sure to produce a crop of
imitations said the Journalist

It has had a lot of anticipations for the matter of that said the
Winebrother

Oh of course there have been thefts from the Louvre before

I was thinking of the spiriting away of human beings rather than
pictures In particular I was thinking of the case of my aunt Crispina
Umberleigh

I remember hearing something of the affair said the Journalist but I
was away from England at the time I never quite knew what was supposed
to have happened

You may hear what really happened if you will respect it as a
confidence said the Wine Merchant In the first place I may say that
the disappearance of Mrs Umberleigh was not regarded by the family
entirely as a bereavement My uncle Edward Umberleigh was not by any
means a weakkneed individual in fact in the world of politics he had to
be reckoned with more or less as a strong man but he was unmistakably
dominated by Crispina indeed I never met any human being who was not
frozen into subjection when brought into prolonged contact with her Some
people are born to command Crispina Mrs Umberleigh was born to
legislate codify administrate censor license ban execute and sit
in judgement generally If she was not born with that destiny she
adopted it at an early age From the kitchen regions upwards every one
in the household came under her despotic sway and stayed there with the
submissiveness of molluscs involved in a glacial epoch As a nephew on a
footing of only occasional visits she affected me merely as an epidemic
disagreeable while it lasted but without any permanent effect but her
own sons and daughters stood in mortal awe of her their studies
friendships diet amusements religious observances and way of doing
their hair were all regulated and ordained according to the august ladys
will and pleasure This will help you to understand the sensation of
stupefaction which was caused in the family when she unobtrusively and
inexplicably vanished It was as though St Pauls Cathedral or the
Piccadilly Hotel had disappeared in the night leaving nothing but an
open space to mark where it had stood As far as was known nothing was
troubling her in fact there was much before her to make life
particularly well worth living The youngest boy had come back from
school with an unsatisfactory report and she was to have sat in
judgement on him the very afternoon of the day she disappearedif it had
been he who had vanished in a hurry one could have supplied the motive
Then she was in the middle of a newspaper correspondence with a rural
dean in which she had already proved him guilty of heresy inconsistency
and unworthy quibbling and no ordinary consideration would have induced
her to discontinue the controversy Of course the matter was put in the
hands of the police but as far as possible it was kept out of the
papers and the generally accepted explanation of her withdrawal from her
social circle was that she had gone into a nursing home

And what was the immediate effect on the home circle asked the
Journalist

All the girls bought themselves bicycles the feminine cycling craze was
still in existence and Crispina had rigidly vetoed any participation in
it among the members of her household The youngest boy let himself go
to such an extent during his next term that it had to be his last as far
as that particular establishment was concerned The elder boys
propounded a theory that their mother might be wandering somewhere
abroad and searched for her assiduously chiefly it must be admitted
in a class of Montmartre resort where it was extremely improbable that
she would be found

And all this while couldnt your uncle get hold of the least clue

As a matter of fact he had received some information though of course I
did not know of it at the time He got a message one day telling him
that his wife had been kidnapped and smuggled out of the country she was
said to be hidden away in one of the islands off the coast of Norway I
think it was in comfortable surroundings and well cared for And with
the information came a demand for money a lump sum of 2000 pounds was to
be paid yearly Failing this she would be immediately restored to her
family

The Journalist was silent for a moment and them began to laugh quietly

It was certainly an inverted form of holding to ransom he said

If you had known my aunt said the Wine Merchant you would have
wondered that they didnt put the figure higher

I realise the temptation Did your uncle succumb to it

Well you see he had to think of others as well as himself For the
family to have gone back into the Crispina thraldom after having tasted
the delights of liberty would have been a tragedy and there were even
wider considerations to be taken into account Since his bereavement he
had unconsciously taken up a far bolder and more initiatory line in
public affairs and his popularity and influence had increased
correspondingly From being merely a strong man in the political world
he began to be spoken of as _the_ strong man All this he knew would be
jeopardised if he once more dropped into the social position of the
husband of Mrs Umberleigh He was a rich man and the 2000 pounds a
year though not exactly a fleabite did not seem an extravagant price to
pay for the boardingout of Crispina Of course he had severe qualms of
conscience about the arrangement Later on when he took me into his
confidence he told me that in paying the ransom or hushmoney as I
should have called it he was partly influenced by the fear that if he
refused it the kidnappers might have vented their rage and disappointment
on their captive It was better he said to think of her being well
cared for as a highlyvalued payingguest in one of the Lofoden Islands
than to have her struggling miserably home in a maimed and mutilated
condition Anyway he paid the yearly instalment as punctually as one
pays a fire insurance and with equal promptitude there would come an
acknowledgment of the money and a brief statement to the effect that
Crispina was in good health and fairly cheerful spirits One report even
mentioned that she was busying herself with a scheme for proposed reforms
in Church management to be pressed on the local pastorate Another spoke
of a rheumatic attack and a journey to a cure on the mainland and on
that occasion an additional eighty pounds was demanded and conceded Of
course it was to the interest of the kidnappers to keep their charge in
good health but the secrecy with which they managed to shroud their
arrangements argued a really wonderful organisation If my uncle was
paying a rather high price at least he could console himself with the
reflection that he was paying specialists fees

Meanwhile had the police given up all attempts to track the missing
lady asked the Journalist

Not entirely they came to my uncle from time to time to report on clues
which they thought might yield some elucidation as to her fate or
whereabouts but I think they had their suspicions that he was possessed
of more information than he had put at their disposal And then after a
disappearance of more than eight years Crispina returned with dramatic
suddenness to the home she had left so mysteriously

She had given her captors the slip

She had never been captured Her wandering away had been caused by a
sudden and complete loss of memory She usually dressed rather in the
style of a superior kind of charwoman and it was not so very surprising
that she should have imagined that she was one and still less that
people should accept her statement and help her to get work She had
wandered as far afield as Birmingham and found fairly steady employment
there her energy and enthusiasm in putting peoples rooms in order
counterbalancing her obstinate and domineering characteristics It was
the shock of being patronisingly addressed as my good woman by a
curate who was disputing with her where the stove should be placed in a
parish concert hall that led to the sudden restoration of her memory I
think you forget who you are speaking to she observed crushingly which
was rather unduly severe considering she had only just remembered it
herself

But exclaimed the Journalist the Lofoden Island people Who had
they got hold of

A purely mythical prisoner It was an attempt in the first place by
some one who knew something of the domestic situation probably a
discharged valet to bluff a lump sum out of Edward Umberleigh before the
missing woman turned up the subsequent yearly instalments were an
unlookedfor increment to the original haul

Crispina found that the eight years interregnum had materially weakened
her ascendancy over her now grownup offspring Her husband however
never accomplished anything great in the political world after her
return the strain of trying to account satisfactorily for an unspecified
expenditure of sixteen thousand pounds spread over eight years
sufficiently occupied his mental energies Here is Belgrad and another
custom house




THE WOLVES OF CERNOGRATZ


Are they any old legends attached to the castle asked Conrad of his
sister Conrad was a prosperous Hamburg merchant but he was the one
poeticallydispositioned member of an eminently practical family

The Baroness Gruebel shrugged her plump shoulders

There are always legends hanging about these old places They are not
difficult to invent and they cost nothing In this case there is a story
that when any one dies in the castle all the dogs in the village and the
wild beasts in forest howl the night long It would not be pleasant to
listen to would it

It would be weird and romantic said the Hamburg merchant

Anyhow it isnt true said the Baroness complacently since we bought
the place we have had proof that nothing of the sort happens When the
old motherinlaw died last springtime we all listened but there was no
howling It is just a story that lends dignity to the place without
costing anything

The story is not as you have told it said Amalie the grey old
governess Every one turned and looked at her in astonishment She was
wont to sit silent and prim and faded in her place at table never
speaking unless some one spoke to her and there were few who troubled
themselves to make conversation with her Today a sudden volubility had
descended on her she continued to talk rapidly and nervously looking
straight in front of her and seeming to address no one in particular

It is not when _any one_ dies in the castle that the howling is heard
It was when one of the Cernogratz family died here that the wolves came
from far and near and howled at the edge of the forest just before the
death hour There were only a few couple of wolves that had their lairs
in this part of the forest but at such a time the keepers say there
would be scores of them gliding about in the shadows and howling in
chorus and the dogs of the castle and the village and all the farms
round would bay and howl in fear and anger at the wolf chorus and as the
soul of the dying one left its body a tree would crash down in the park
That is what happened when a Cernogratz died in his family castle But
for a stranger dying here of course no wolf would howl and no tree would
fall Oh no

There was a note of defiance almost of contempt in her voice as she
said the last words The wellfed muchtoowell dressed Baroness stared
angrily at the dowdy old woman who had come forth from her usual and
seemly position of effacement to speak so disrespectfully

You seem to know quite a lot about the von Cernogratz legends Fraulein
Schmidt she said sharply I did not know that family histories were
among the subjects you are supposed to be proficient in

The answer to her taunt was even more unexpected and astonishing than the
conversational outbreak which had provoked it

I am a von Cernogratz myself said the old woman that is why I know
the family history

You a von Cernogratz You came in an incredulous chorus

When we became very poor she explained and I had to go out and give
teaching lessons I took another name I thought it would be more in
keeping But my grandfather spent much of his time as a boy in this
castle and my father used to tell me many stories about it and of
course I knew all the family legends and stories When one has nothing
left to one but memories one guards and dusts them with especial care I
little thought when I took service with you that I should one day come
with you to the old home of my family I could wish it had been anywhere
else

There was silence when she finished speaking and then the Baroness
turned the conversation to a less embarrassing topic than family
histories But afterwards when the old governess had slipped away
quietly to her duties there arose a clamour of derision and disbelief

It was an impertinence snapped out the Baron his protruding eyes
taking on a scandalised expression fancy the woman talking like that at
our table She almost told us we were nobodies and I dont believe a
word of it She is just Schmidt and nothing more She has been talking
to some of the peasants about the old Cernogratz family and raked up
their history and their stories

She wants to make herself out of some consequence said the Baroness
she knows she will soon be past work and she wants to appeal to our
sympathies Her grandfather indeed

The Baroness had the usual number of grandfathers but she never never
boasted about them

I dare say her grandfather was a pantry boy or something of the sort in
the castle sniggered the Baron that part of the story may be true

The merchant from Hamburg said nothing he had seen tears in the old
womans eyes when she spoke of guarding her memoriesor being of an
imaginative disposition he thought he had

I shall give her notice to go as soon as the New Year festivities are
over said the Baroness till then I shall be too busy to manage
without her

But she had to manage without her all the same for in the cold biting
weather after Christmas the old governess fell ill and kept to her room

It is most provoking said the Baroness as her guests sat round the
fire on one of the last evenings of the dying year all the time that
she has been with us I cannot remember that she was ever seriously ill
too ill to go about and do her work I mean And now when I have the
house full and she could be useful in so many ways she goes and breaks
down One is sorry for her of course she looks so withered and
shrunken but it is intensely annoying all the same

Most annoying agreed the bankers wife sympathetically it is the
intense cold I expect it breaks the old people up It has been
unusually cold this year

The frost is the sharpest that has been known in December for many
years said the Baron

And of course she is quite old said the Baroness I wish I had
given her notice some weeks ago then she would have left before this
happened to her Why Wappi what is the matter with you

The small woolly lapdog had leapt suddenly down from its cushion and
crept shivering under the sofa At the same moment an outburst of angry
barking came from the dogs in the castleyard and other dogs could be
heard yapping and barking in the distance

What is disturbing the animals asked the Baron

And then the humans listening intently heard the sound that had roused
the dogs to their demonstrations of fear and rage heard a longdrawn
whining howl rising and falling seeming at one moment leagues away at
others sweeping across the snow until it appeared to come from the foot
of the castle walls All the starved cold misery of a frozen world all
the relentless hungerfury of the wild blended with other forlorn and
haunting melodies to which one could give no name seemed concentrated in
that wailing cry

Wolves cried the Baron

Their music broke forth in one raging burst seeming to come from
everywhere

Hundreds of wolves said the Hamburg merchant who was a man of strong
imagination

Moved by some impulse which she could not have explained the Baroness
left her guests and made her way to the narrow cheerless room where the
old governess lay watching the hours of the drying year slip by In
spite of the biting cold of the winter night the window stood open With
a scandalised exclamation on her lips the Baroness rushed forward to
close it

Leave it open said the old woman in a voice that for all its weakness
carried an air of command such as the Baroness had never heard before
from her lips

But you will die of cold she expostulated

I am dying in any case said the voice and I want to hear their
music They have come from far and wide to sing the deathmusic of my
family It is beautiful that they have come I am the last von
Cernogratz that will die in our old castle and they have come to sing to
me Hark how loud they are calling

The cry of the wolves rose on the still winter air and floated round the
castle walls in longdrawn piercing wails the old woman lay back on her
couch with a look of longdelayed happiness on her face

Go away she said to the Baroness I am not lonely any more I am one
of a great old family    

I think she is dying said the Baroness when she had rejoined her
guests I suppose we must send for a doctor And that terrible howling
Not for much money would I have such deathmusic

That music is not to be bought for any amount of money said Conrad

Hark What is that other sound asked the Baron as a noise of
splitting and crashing was heard

It was a tree falling in the park

There was a moment of constrained silence and then the bankers wife
spoke

It is the intense cold that is splitting the trees It is also the cold
that has brought the wolves out in such numbers It is many years since
we have had such a cold winter

The Baroness eagerly agreed that the cold was responsible for these
things It was the cold of the open window too which caused the heart
failure that made the doctors ministrations unnecessary for the old
Fraulein But the notice in the newspapers looked very well

 On December 29th at Schloss Cernogratz Amalie von Cernogratz for
 many years the valued friend of Baron and Baroness Gruebel




LOUIS


It would be jolly to spend Easter in Vienna this year said
Strudwarden and look up some of my old friends there Its about the
jolliest place I know of to be at for Easter

I thought we had made up our minds to spend Easter at Brighton
interrupted Lena Strudwarden with an air of aggrieved surprise

You mean that you had made up your mind that we should spend Easter
there said her husband we spent last Easter there and Whitsuntide as
well and the year before that we were at Worthing and Brighton again
before that I think it would be just as well to have a real change of
scene while we are about it

The journey to Vienna would be very expensive said Lena

You are not often concerned about economy said Strudwarden and in
any case the trip of Vienna wont cost a bit more than the rather
meaningless luncheon parties we usually give to quite meaningless
acquaintances at Brighton To escape from all that set would be a
holiday in itself

Strudwarden spoke feelingly Lena Strudwarden maintained an equally
feeling silence on that particular subject The set that she gathered
round her at Brighton and other South Coast resorts was composed of
individuals who might be dull and meaningless in themselves but who
understood the art of flattering Mrs Strudwarden She had no intention
of foregoing their society and their homage and flinging herself among
unappreciative strangers in a foreign capital

You must go to Vienna alone if you are bent on going she said I
couldnt leave Louis behind and a dog is always a fearful nuisance in a
foreign hotel besides all the fuss and separation of the quarantine
restrictions when one comes back Louis would die if he was parted from
me for even a week You dont know what that would mean to me

Lena stooped down and kissed the nose of the diminutive brown Pomeranian
that lay snug and irresponsive beneath a shawl on her lap

Look here said Strudwarden this eternal Louis business is getting to
be a ridiculous nuisance Nothing can be done no plans can be made
without some veto connected with that animals whims or convenience being
imposed If you were a priest in attendance on some African fetish you
couldnt set up a more elaborate code of restrictions I believe youd
ask the Government to put off a General Election if you thought it would
interfere with Louiss comfort in any way

By way of answer to this tirade Mrs Strudwarden stooped down again and
kissed the irresponsive brown nose It was the action of a woman with a
beautifully meek nature who would however send the whole world to the
stake sooner than yield an inch where she knew herself to be in the
right

It isnt as if you were in the least bit fond of animals went on
Strudwarden with growing irritation when we are down at Kerryfield you
wont stir a step to take the house dogs out even if theyre dying for a
run and I dont think youve been in the stables twice in your life You
laugh at what you call the fuss thats being made over the extermination
of plumage birds and you are quite indignant with me if I interfere on
behalf of an illtreated overdriven animal on the road And yet you
insist on every ones plans being made subservient to the convenience of
that stupid little morsel of fur and selfishness

You are prejudiced against my little Louis said Lena with a world of
tender regret in her voice

Ive never had the chance of being anything else but prejudiced against
him said Strudwarden I know what a jolly responsive companion a
doggie can be but Ive never been allowed to put a finger near Louis
You say he snaps at any one except you and your maid and you snatched
him away from old Lady Peterby the other day when she wanted to pet him
for fear he would bury his teeth in her All that I ever see of him is
the top of his unhealthylooking little nose peeping out from his basket
or from your muff and I occasionally hear his wheezy little bark when
you take him for a walk up and down the corridor You cant expect one
to get extravagantly fond of a dog of that sort One might as well work
up an affection for the cuckoo in a cuckooclock

He loves me said Lena rising from the table and bearing the shawl
swathed Louis in her arms He loves only me and perhaps that is why I
love him so much in return I dont care what you say against him I am
not going to be separated from him If you insist on going to Vienna you
must go alone as far as I am concerned I think it would be much more
sensible if you were to come to Brighton with Louis and me but of course
you must please yourself

You must get rid of that dog said Strudwardens sister when Lena had
left the room it must be helped to some sudden and merciful end Lena
is merely making use of it as an instrument for getting her own way on
dozens of occasions when she would otherwise be obliged to yield
gracefully to your wishes or to the general convenience I am convinced
that she doesnt care a brass button about the animal itself When her
friends are buzzing round her at Brighton or anywhere else and the dog
would be in the way it has to spend whole days alone with the maid but
if you want Lena to go with you anywhere where she doesnt want to go
instantly she trots out the excuse that she couldnt be separated from
her dog Have you ever come into a room unobserved and heard Lena
talking to her beloved pet I never have I believe she only fusses
over it when theres some one present to notice her

I dont mind admitting said Strudwarden that Ive dwelt more than
once lately on the possibility of some fatal accident putting an end to
Louiss existence Its not very easy though to arrange a fatality for
a creature that spends most of its time in a muff or asleep in a toy
kennel I dont think poison would be any good its obviously horribly
overfed for Ive seen Lena offer it dainties at table sometimes but it
never seems to eat them

Lena will be away at church on Wednesday morning said Elsie
Strudwarden reflectively she cant take Louis with her there and she
is going on to the Dellings for lunch That will give you several hours
in which to carry out your purpose The maid will be flirting with the
chauffeur most of the time and anyhow I can manage to keep her out of
the way on some pretext or other

That leaves the field clear said Strudwarden but unfortunately my
brain is equally a blank as far as any lethal project is concerned The
little beast is so monstrously inactive I cant pretend that it leapt
into the bath and drowned itself or that it took on the butchers
mastiff in unequal combat and got chewed up In what possible guise
could death come to a confirmed basketdweller It would be too
suspicious if we invented a Suffragette raid and pretended that they
invaded Lenas boudoir and threw a brick at him We should have to do a
lot of other damage as well which would be rather a nuisance and the
servants would think it odd that they had seen nothing of the invaders

I have an idea said Elsie get a box with an airtight lid and bore
a small hole in it just big enough to let in an indiarubber tube Pop
Louis kennel and all into the box shut it down and put the other end
of the tube over the gasbracket There you have a perfect lethal
chamber You can stand the kennel at the open window afterwards to get
rid of the smell of gas and all that Lena will find when she comes home
late in the afternoon will be a placidly defunct Louis

Novels have been written about women like you said Strudwarden you
have a perfectly criminal mind Lets come and look for a box

Two mornings later the conspirators stood gazing guiltily at a stout
square box connected with the gasbracket by a length of indiarubber
tubing

Not a sound said Elsie he never stirred it must have been quite
painless All the same I feel rather horrid now its done

The ghastly part has to come said Strudwarden turning off the gas
Well lift the lid slowly and let the gas out by degrees Swing the
door to and fro to send a draught through the room

Some minutes later when the fumes had rushed off he stooped down and
lifted out the little kennel with its grim burden Elsie gave an
exclamation of terror Louis sat at the door of his dwelling head erect
and ears pricked as coldly and defiantly inert as when they had put him
into his execution chamber Strudwarden dropped the kennel with a jerk
and stared for a long moment at the miracledog then he went into a peal
of chattering laughter

It was certainly a wonderful imitation of a truculentlooking toy
Pomeranian and the apparatus that gave forth a wheezy bark when you
pressed it had materially helped the imposition that Lena and Lenas
maid had foisted on the household For a woman who disliked animals
but liked getting her own way under a halo of unselfishness Mrs
Strudwarden had managed rather well

Louis is dead was the curt information that greeted Lena on her return
from her luncheon party

Louis _dead_ she exclaimed

Yes he flew at the butcherboy and bit him and he bit me too when I
tried to get him off so I had to have him destroyed You warned me that
he snapped but you didnt tell me that he was downright dangerous I
shall have to pay the boy something heavy by way of compensation so you
will have to go without those buckles that you wanted to have for Easter
also I shall have to go to Vienna to consult Dr Schroeder who is a
specialist on dogbites and you will have to come too I have sent what
remains of Louis to Rowland Ward to be stuffed that will be my Easter
gift to you instead of the buckles For Heavens sake Lena weep if
you really feel it so much anything would be better than standing there
staring as if you thought I had lost my reason

Lena Strudwarden did not weep but her attempt at laughing was an
unmistakable failure




THEGUESTS


The landscape seen from our windows is certainly charming said
Annabel those cherry orchards and green meadows and the river winding
along the valley and the church tower peeping out among the elms they
all make a most effective picture Theres something dreadfully sleepy
and languorous about it though stagnation seems to be the dominant
note Nothing ever happens here seedtime and harvest an occasional
outbreak of measles or a mildly destructive thunderstorm and a little
election excitement about once in five years that is all that we have to
modify the monotony of our existence Rather dreadful isnt it

On the contrary said Matilda I find it soothing and restful but
then you see Ive lived in countries where things do happen ever so
many at a time when youre not ready for them happening all at once

That of course makes a difference said Annabel

I have never forgotten said Matilda the occasion when the Bishop of
Bequar paid us an unexpected visit he was on his way to lay the
foundationstone of a missionhouse or something of the sort

I thought that out there you were always prepared for emergency guests
turning up said Annabel

I was quite prepared for half a dozen Bishops said Matilda but it
was rather disconcerting to find out after a little conversation that
this particular one was a distant cousin of mine belonging to a branch
of the family that had quarrelled bitterly and offensively with our
branch about a Crown Derby dessert service they got it and we ought to
have got it in some legacy or else we got it and they thought they
ought to have it I forget which anyhow I know they behaved
disgracefully Now here was one of them turning up in the odour of
sanctity so to speak and claiming the traditional hospitality of the
East

It was rather trying but you could have left your husband to do most of
the entertaining

My husband was fifty miles upcountry talking sense or what he
imagined to be sense to a village community that fancied one of their
leading men was a weretiger

A what tiger

A weretiger youve heard of werewolves havent you a mixture of
wolf and human being and demon Well in those parts they have
weretigers or think they have and I must say that in this case so far
as sworn and uncontested evidence went they had every ground for
thinking so However as we gave up witchcraft prosecutions about three
hundred years ago we dont like to have other people keeping on our
discarded practices it doesnt seem respectful to our mental and moral
position

I hope you werent unkind to the Bishop said Annabel

Well of course he was my guest so I had to be outwardly polite to him
but he was tactless enough to rake up the incidents of the old quarrel
and to try to make out that there was something to be said for the way
his side of the family had behaved even if there was which I dont for
a moment admit my house was not the place in which to say it I didnt
argue the matter but I gave my cook a holiday to go and visit his aged
parents some ninety miles away The emergency cook was not a specialist
in curries in fact I dont think cooking in any shape or form could
have been one of his strong points I believe he originally came to us
in the guise of a gardener but as we never pretended to have anything
that could be considered a garden he was utilised as assistant goatherd
in which capacity I understand he gave every satisfaction When the
Bishop heard that I had sent away the cook on a special and unnecessary
holiday he saw the inwardness of the manoeuvre and from that moment we
were scarcely on speaking terms If you have ever had a Bishop with whom
you were not on speaking terms staying in your house you will appreciate
the situation

Annabel confessed that her lifestory had never included such a
disturbing experience

Then continued Matilda to make matters more complicated the
Gwadlipichee overflowed its banks a thing it did every now and then when
the rains were unduly prolonged and the lower part of the house and all
the outbuildings were submerged We managed to get the ponies loose in
time and the syce swam the whole lot of them off to the nearest rising
ground A goat or two the chief goatherd the chief goatherds wife
and several of their babies came to anchorage in the verandah All the
rest of the available space was filled up with wet bedraggledlooking
hens and chickens one never really knows how many fowls one possesses
till the servants quarters are flooded out Of course I had been
through something of the sort in previous floods but never before had I
had a houseful of goats and babies and halfdrowned hens supplemented by
a Bishop with whom I was hardly on speaking terms

It must have been a trying experience commented Annabel

More embarrassments were to follow I wasnt going to let a mere
ordinary flood wash out the memory of that Crown Derby dessert service
and I intimated to the Bishop that his large bedroom with a writing
table in it and his small bathroom with a sufficiency of coldwater
jars in it was his share of the premises and that space was rather
congested under the existing circumstances However at about three
oclock in the afternoon when he had awakened from his midday sleep he
made a sudden incursion into the room that was normally the drawingroom
but was now diningroom storehouse saddleroom and half a dozen other
temporary premises as well From the condition of my guests costume he
seemed to think it might also serve as his dressingroom

Im afraid there is nowhere for you to sit I said coldly the
verandah is full of goats

There is a goat in my bedroom he observed with equal coldness and
more than a suspicion of sardonic reproach

Really I said another survivor I thought all the other goats were
done for

This particular goat is quite done for he said it is being devoured
by a leopard at the present moment That is why I left the room some
animals resent being watched while they are eating

The leopard of course was easily explained it had been hanging round
the goat sheds when the flood came and had clambered up by the outside
staircase leading to the Bishops bathroom thoughtfully bringing a goat
with it Probably it found the bathroom too damp and shutin for its
taste and transferred its banqueting operations to the bedroom while the
Bishop was having his nap

What a frightful situation exclaimed Annabel fancy having a ravening
leopard in the house with a flood all round you

Not in the least ravening said Matilda it was full of goat had any
amount of water at its disposal if it felt thirsty and probably had no
more immediate wish than a desire for uninterrupted sleep Still I
think any one will admit that it was an embarrassing predicament to have
your only available guestroom occupied by a leopard the verandah choked
up with goats and babies and wet hens and a Bishop with whom you were
scarcely on speaking terms planted down in your own sittingroom I
really dont know how I got through those crawling hours and of course
mealtimes only made matters worse The emergency cook had every excuse
for sending in watery soup and sloppy rice and as neither the chief goat
herd nor his wife were expert divers the cellar could not be reached
Fortunately the Gwadlipichee subsides as rapidly as it rises and just
before dawn the syce came splashing back with the ponies only fetlock
deep in water Then there arose some awkwardness from the fact that the
Bishop wished to leave sooner than the leopard did and as the latter was
ensconced in the midst of the formers personal possessions there was an
obvious difficulty in altering the order of departure I pointed out to
the Bishop that a leopards habits and tastes are not those of an otter
and that it naturally preferred walking to wading and that in any case a
meal of an entire goat washed down with tubwater justified a certain
amount of repose if I had had guns fired to frighten the animal away as
the Bishop suggested it would probably merely have left the bedroom to
come into the already overcrowded drawingroom Altogether it was
rather a relief when they both left Now perhaps you can understand my
appreciation of a sleepy countryside where things dont happen




THE PENANCE


Octavian Ruttle was one of those lively cheerful individuals on whom
amiability had set its unmistakable stamp and like most of his kind
his souls peace depended in large measure on the unstinted approval of
his fellows In hunting to death a small tabby cat he had done a thing
of which he scarcely approved himself and he was glad when the gardener
had hidden the body in its hastily dug grave under a lone oaktree in the
meadow the same tree that the hunted quarry had climbed as a last effort
towards safety It had been a distasteful and seemingly ruthless deed
but circumstances had demanded the doing of it Octavian kept chickens
at least he kept some of them others vanished from his keeping leaving
only a few bloodstained feathers to mark the manner of their going The
tabby cat from the large grey house that stood with its back to the
meadow had been detected in many furtive visits to the hencoups and
after due negotiation with those in authority at the grey house a
sentence of death had been agreed on The children will mind but they
need not know had been the last word on the matter

The children in question were a standing puzzle to Octavian in the
course of a few months he considered that he should have known their
names ages the dates of their birthdays and have been introduced to
their favourite toys They remained however as noncommittal as the
long blank wall that shut them off from the meadow a wall over which
their three heads sometimes appeared at odd moments They had parents in
Indiathat much Octavian had learned in the neighbourhood the children
beyond grouping themselves garmentwise into sexes a girl and two boys
carried their lifestory no further on his behoof And now it seemed he
was engaged in something which touched them closely but must be hidden
from their knowledge

The poor helpless chickens had gone one by one to their doom so it was
meet that their destroyer should come to a violent end yet Octavian felt
some qualms when his share of the violence was ended The little cat
headed off from its wonted tracks of safety had raced unfriended from
shelter to shelter and its end had been rather piteous Octavian walked
through the long grass of the meadow with a step less jaunty than usual
And as he passed beneath the shadow of the high blank wall he glanced up
and became aware that his hunting had had undesired witnesses Three
white set faces were looking down at him and if ever an artist wanted a
threefold study of cold human hate impotent yet unyielding raging yet
masked in stillness he would have found it in the triple gaze that met
Octavians eye

Im sorry but it had to be done said Octavian with genuine apology
in his voice

Beast

The answer came from three throats with startling intensity

Octavian felt that the blank wall would not be more impervious to his
explanations than the bunch of human hostility that peered over its
coping he wisely decided to withhold his peace overtures till a more
hopeful occasion

Two days later he ransacked the best sweet shop in the neighbouring
market town for a box of chocolates that by its size and contents should
fitly atone for the dismal deed done under the oak tree in the meadow
The two first specimens that were shown him he hastily rejected one had
a group of chickens pictured on its lid the other bore the portrait of a
tabby kitten A third sample was more simply bedecked with a spray of
painted poppies and Octavian hailed the flowers of forgetfulness as a
happy omen He felt distinctly more at ease with his surroundings when
the imposing package had been sent across to the grey house and a
message returned to say that it had been duly given to the children The
next morning he sauntered with purposeful steps past the long blank wall
on his way to the chickenrun and piggery that stood at the bottom of the
meadow The three children were perched at their accustomed lookout
and their range of sight did not seem to concern itself with Octavians
presence As he became depressingly aware of the aloofness of their gaze
he also noted a strange variegation in the herbage at his feet the
greensward for a considerable space around was strewn and speckled with a
chocolatecoloured hail enlivened here and there with gay tinsellike
wrappings or the glistening mauve of crystallised violets It was as
though the fairy paradise of a greedyminded child had taken shape and
substance in the vegetation of the meadow Octavians bloodmoney had
been flung back at him in scorn

To increase his discomfiture the march of events tended to shift the
blame of ravaged chickencoops from the supposed culprit who had already
paid full forfeit the young chicks were still carried off and it seemed
highly probable that the cat had only haunted the chickenrun to prey on
the rats which harboured there Through the flowing channels of servant
talk the children learned of this belated revision of verdict and
Octavian one day picked up a sheet of copybook paper on which was
painstakingly written Beast Rats eated your chickens More ardently
than ever did he wish for an opportunity for sloughing off the disgrace
that enwrapped him and earning some happier nickname from his three
unsparing judges

And one day a chance inspiration came to him Olivia his twoyearold
daughter was accustomed to spend the hour from high noon till one
oclock with her father while the nursemaid gobbled and digested her
dinner and novelette About the same time the blank wall was usually
enlivened by the presence of its three small wardens Octavian with
seeming carelessness of purpose brought Olivia well within hail of the
watchers and noted with hidden delight the growing interest that dawned
in that hitherto sternly hostile quarter His little Olivia with her
sleepy placid ways was going to succeed where he with his anxious well
meant overtures had so signally failed He brought her a large yellow
dahlia which she grasped tightly in one hand and regarded with a stare
of benevolent boredom such as one might bestow on amateur classical
dancing performed in aid of a deserving charity Then he turned shyly to
the group perched on the wall and asked with affected carelessness Do
you like flowers Three solemn nods rewarded his venture

Which sorts do you like best he asked this time with a distinct
betrayal of eagerness in his voice

Those with all the colours over there Three chubby arms pointed to a
distant tangle of sweetpea Childlike they had asked for what lay
farthest from hand but Octavian trotted off gleefully to obey their
welcome behest He pulled and plucked with unsparing hand and brought
every variety of tint that he could see into his bunch that was rapidly
becoming a bundle Then he turned to retrace his steps and found the
blank wall blanker and more deserted than ever while the foreground was
void of all trace of Olivia Far down the meadow three children were
pushing a gocart at the utmost speed they could muster in the direction
of the piggeries it was Olivias gocart and Olivia sat in it somewhat
bumped and shaken by the pace at which she was being driven but
apparently retaining her wonted composure of mind Octavian stared for a
moment at the rapidly moving group and then started in hot pursuit
shedding as he ran sprays of blossom from the mass of sweetpea that he
still clutched in his hands Fast as he ran the children had reached the
piggery before he could overtake them and he arrived just in time to see
Olivia wondering but unprotesting hauled and pushed up to the roof of
the nearest sty They were old buildings in some need of repair and the
rickety roof would certainly not have borne Octavians weight if he had
attempted to follow his daughter and her captors on their new vantage
ground

What are you going to do with her he panted There was no mistaking
the grim trend of mischief in those flushed by sternly composed young
faces

Hang her in chains over a slow fire said one of the boys Evidently
they had been reading English history

Frow her down the pigs will dvour her every bit cept the palms of her
hands said the other boy It was also evident that they had studied
Biblical history

The last proposal was the one which most alarmed Octavian since it might
be carried into effect at a moments notice there had been cases he
remembered of pigs eating babies

You surely wouldnt treat my poor little Olivia in that way he
pleaded

You killed our little cat came in stern reminder from three throats

Im sorry I did said Octavian and if there is a standard measurement
in truths Octavians statement was assuredly a large nine

We shall be very sorry when weve killed Olivia said the girl but we
cant be sorry till weve done it

The inexorable childlogic rose like an unyielding rampart before
Octavians scared pleadings Before he could think of any fresh line of
appeal his energies were called out in another direction Olivia had
slid off the roof and fallen with a soft unctuous splash into a morass
of muck and decaying straw Octavian scrambled hastily over the pigsty
wall to her rescue and at once found himself in a quagmire that engulfed
his feet Olivia after the first shock of surprise at her sudden drop
through the air had been mildly pleased at finding herself in close and
unstinted contact with the sticky element that oozed around her but as
she began to sink gently into the bed of slime a feeling dawned on her
that she was not after all very happy and she began to cry in the
tentative fashion of the normally good child Octavian battling with
the quagmire which seemed to have learned the rare art of giving way at
all points without yielding an inch saw his daughter slowly disappearing
in the engulfing slush her smeared face further distorted with the
contortions of whimpering wonder while from their perch on the pigsty
roof the three children looked down with the cold unpitying detachment of
the Parcae Sisters

I cant reach her in time gasped Octavian shell be choked in the
muck Wont you help her

No one helped our cat came the inevitable reminder

Ill do anything to show you how sorry I am about that cried Octavian
with a further desperate flounder which carried him scarcely two inches
forward

Will you stand in a white sheet by the grave

Yes screamed Octavian

Holding a candle

An saying Im a miserable Beast

Octavian agreed to both suggestions

For a long long time

For half an hour said Octavian There was an anxious ring in his
voice as he named the timelimit was there not the precedent of a German
king who did openair penance for several days and nights at Christmas
time clad only in his shirt Fortunately the children did not appear to
have read German history and half an hour seemed long and goodly in
their eyes

All right came with threefold solemnity from the roof and a moment
later a short ladder had been laboriously pushed across to Octavian who
lost no time in propping it against the low pigsty wall Scrambling
gingerly along its rungs he was able to lean across the morass that
separated him from his slowly foundering offspring and extract her like
an unwilling cork from its slushy embrace A few minutes later he was
listening to the shrill and repeated assurances of the nursemaid that her
previous experience of filthy spectacles had been on a notably smaller
scale

That same evening when twilight was deepening into darkness Octavian took
up his position as penitent under the lone oaktree having first
carefully undressed the part Clad in a zephyr shirt which on this
occasion thoroughly merited its name he held in one hand a lighted
candle and in the other a watch into which the soul of a dead plumber
seemed to have passed A box of matches lay at his feet and was resorted
to on the fairly frequent occasions when the candle succumbed to the
night breezes The house loomed inscrutable in the middle distance but
as Octavian conscientiously repeated the formula of his penance he felt
certain that three pairs of solemn eyes were watching his mothshared
vigil

And the next morning his eyes were gladdened by a sheet of copybook
paper lying beside the blank wall on which was written the message Un
Beast




THE PHANTOM LUNCHEON


The SmithlyDubbs are in Town said Sir James I wish you would show
them some attention Ask them to lunch with you at the Ritz or
somewhere

From the little Ive seen of the SmithlyDubbs I dont thing I want to
cultivate their acquaintance said Lady Drakmanton

They always work for us at election times said her husband I dont
suppose they influence very many votes but they have an uncle who is on
one of my ward committees and another uncle speaks sometimes at some of
our less important meetings Those sort of people expect some return in
the shape of hospitality

Expect it exclaimed Lady Drakmanton the Misses SmithlyDubb do more
than that they almost demand it They belong to my club and hang about
the lobby just about lunchtime all three of them with their tongues
hanging out of their mouths and the sixcourse look in their eyes If I
were to breathe the word lunch they would hustle me into a taxi and
scream Ritz or Dieudonnes to the driver before I knew what was
happening

All the same I think you ought to ask them to a meal of some sort
persisted Sir James

I consider that showing hospitality to the SmithlyDubbs is carrying
Free Food principles to a regrettable extreme said Lady Drakmanton
Ive entertained the Joneses and the Browns and the Snapheimers and the
Lubrikoffs and heaps of others whose names I forget but I dont see why
I should inflict the society of the Misses SmithlyDubb on myself for a
solid hour Imagine it sixty minutes more or less of unrelenting
gobble and gabble Why cant _you_ take them on Milly she asked
turning hopefully to her sister

I dont know them said Milly hastily

All the better you can pass yourself off as me People say that we are
so alike that they can hardly tell us apart and Ive only spoken to
these tiresome young women about twice in my life at committeerooms
and bowed to them in the club Any of the club pageboys will point them
out to you theyre always to be found lolling about the hall just before
lunchtime

My dear Betty dont be absurd protested Milly Ive got some people
lunching with me at the Carlton tomorrow and Im leaving Town the day
afterwards

What time is your lunch tomorrow asked Lady Drakmanton reflectively

Two oclock said Milly

Good said her sister the SmithlyDubbs shall lunch with me
tomorrow It shall be rather an amusing lunchparty At least I shall
be amused

The last two remarks she made to herself Other people did not always
appreciate her ideas of humour Sir James never did

The next day Lady Drakmanton made some marked variations in her usual
toilet effects She dressed her hair in an unaccustomed manner and put
on a hat that added to the transformation of her appearance When she
had made one or two minor alterations she was sufficiently unlike her
usual smart self to produce some hesitation in the greeting which the
Misses SmithlyDubb bestowed on her in the clublobby She responded
however with a readiness which set their doubts at rest

What is the Carlton like for lunching in she asked breezily

The restaurant received an enthusiastic recommendation from the three
sisters

Lets go and lunch there shall we she suggested and in a few
minutes time the SmithlyDubb mind was contemplating at close quarters a
happy vista of baked meats and approved vintage

Are you going to start with caviare I am confided Lady Drakmanton
and the SmithlyDubbs started with caviare The subsequent dishes were
chosen in the same ambitious spirit and by the time they had arrived at
the wild duck course it was beginning to be a rather expensive lunch

The conversation hardly kept pace with the brilliancy of the menu
Repeated references on the part of the guests to the local political
conditions and prospects in Sir Jamess constituency were met with vague
ahs and indeeds from Lady Drakmanton who might have been expected to
be specially interested

I think when the Insurance Act is a little better understood it will
lose some of its present unpopularity hazarded Cecilia SmithlyDubb

Will it I dare say Im afraid politics dont interest me very much
said Lady Drakmanton

The three Miss SmithlyDubbs put down their cups of Turkish coffee and
stared Then they broke into protesting giggles

Of course youre joking they said

Not me was the disconcerting answer I cant make head or tail of
these bothering old politics Never could and never want to Ive
quite enough to do to manage my own affairs and thats a fact

But exclaimed Amanda SmithlyDubb with a squeal of bewilderment
breaking into her voice I was told you spoke so informingly about the
Insurance Act at one of our social evenings

It was Lady Drakmanton who stared now Do you know she said with a
scared look around her rather a dreadful thing is happening Im
suffering from a complete loss of memory I cant even think who I am I
remember meeting you somewhere and I remember you asking me to come and
lunch with you here and that I accepted your kind invitation Beyond
that my mind is a positive blank

The scared look was transferred with intensified poignancy to the faces
of her companions

_You_ asked _us_ to lunch they exclaimed hurriedly That seemed a
more immediately important point to clear up than the question of
identity

Oh no said the vanishing hostess _that_ I do remember about You
insisted on my coming here because the feeding was so good and I must
say it comes up to all you said about it A very nice lunch its been
What Im worrying about is who on earth am I I havent the faintest
notion

You are Lady Drakmanton exclaimed the three sisters in chorus

Now dont make fun of me she replied crossly I happen to know her
quite well by sight and she isnt a bit like me And its an odd thing
you should have mentioned her for it so happens shes just come into the
room That lady in black with the yellow plume in her hat there over
by the door

The SmithlyDubbs looked in the indicated direction and the uneasiness
in their eyes deepened into horror In outward appearance the lady who
had just entered the room certainly came rather nearer to their
recollection of their Members wife than the individual who was sitting
at table with them

Who _are_ you then if that is Lady Drakmanton they asked in panic
stricken bewilderment

That is just what I dont know was the answer and you dont seem to
know much better than I do

You came up to us in the club

In what club

The New Didactic in Calais Street

The New Didactic exclaimed Lady Drakmanton with an air of returning
illumination thank you so much Of course I remember now who I am
Im Ellen Niggle of the Ladies Brasspolishing Guild The Club employs
me to come now and then and see to the polishing of the brass fittings
Thats how I came to know Lady Drakmanton by sight shes very often in
the Club And you are the ladies who so kindly asked me out to lunch
Funny how it should all have slipped my memory all of a sudden The
unaccustomed good food and wine must have been too much for me for the
moment I really couldnt call to mind who I was Good gracious she
broke off suddenly its ten past two I should be at a polishing job in
Whitehall I must scuttle off like a giddy rabbit Thanking you ever
so

She left the room with a scuttle sufficiently suggestive of the animal
she had mentioned but the giddiness was all on the side of her
involuntary hostesses The restaurant seemed to be spinning round them
and the bill when it appeared did nothing to restore their composure
They were as nearly in tears as it is permissible to be during the
luncheon hour in a really good restaurant Financially speaking they
were well able to afford the luxury of an elaborate lunch but their
ideas on the subject of entertaining differed very sharply according to
the circumstances of whether they were dispensing or receiving
hospitality To have fed themselves liberally at their own expense was
perhaps an extravagance to be deplored but at any rate they had had
something for their money to have drawn an unknown and socially
unremunerative Ellen Niggle into the net of their hospitality was a
catastrophe that they could not contemplate with any degree of calmness

The SmithlyDubbs never quite recovered from their unnerving experience
They have given up politics and taken to doing good




A BREAD AND BUTTER MISS


Starling Chatter and Oakhill have both dropped back in the betting
said Bertie van Tahn throwing the morning paper across the breakfast
table

That leaves Nursery Tea practically favourite said Odo Finsberry

Nursery Tea and Pipeclay are at the top of the betting at present said
Bertie but that French horse Le Five OClock seems to be fancied as
much as anything Then there is Whitebait and the Polish horse with a
name like some one trying to stifle a sneeze in church they both seem to
have a lot of support

Its the most open Derby theres been for years said Odo

Its simply no good trying to pick the winner on form said Bertie
one must just trust to luck and inspiration

The question is whether to trust to ones own inspiration or somebody
elses _Sporting Swank_ gives Count Palatine to win and Le Five
OClock for a place

Count Palatinethat adds another to our list of perplexities Good
morning Sir Lulworth have you a fancy for the Derby by any chance

I dont usually take much interest in turf matters said Sir Lulworth
who had just made his appearance but I always like to have a bet on the
Guineas and the Derby This year I confess its rather difficult to
pick out anything that seems markedly better than anything else What do
you think of Snow Bunting

Snow Bunting said Odo with a groan theres another of them Surely
Snow Bunting has no earthly chance

My housekeepers nephew who is a shoeingsmith in the mounted section
of the Church Lads Brigade and an authority on horseflesh expects him
to be among the first three

The nephews of housekeepers are invariably optimists said Bertie
its a kind of natural reaction against the professional pessimism of
their aunts

We dont seem to get much further in our search for the probable
winner said Mrs de Claux the more I listen to you experts the more
hopelessly befogged I get

Its all very well to blame us said Bertie to his hostess you
havent produced anything in the way of an inspiration

My inspiration consisted in asking you down for Derby week retorted
Mrs de Claux I thought you and Odo between you might throw some light
on the question of the moment

Further recriminations were cut short by the arrival of Lola Pevensey
who floated into the room with an air of gracious apology

So sorry to be so late she observed making a rapid tour of inspection
of the breakfast dishes

Did you have a good night asked her hostess with perfunctory
solicitude

Quite thank you said Lola I dreamt a most remarkable dream

A flutter indicative of general boredom went round the table Other
peoples dreams are about as universally interesting as accounts of other
peoples gardens or chickens or children

I dreamt about the winner of the Derby said Lola

A swift reaction of attentive interest set in

Do tell us what you dreamt came in a chorus

The really remarkable thing about it is that Ive dreamt it two nights
running said Lola finally deciding between the allurements of sausages
and kedgeree that is why I thought it worth mentioning You know when
I dream things two or three nights in succession it always means
something I have special powers in that way For instance I once
dreamed three times that a winged lion was flying through the sky and one
of his wings dropped off and he came to the ground with a crash just
afterwards the Campanile at Venice fell down The winged lion is the
symbol of Venice you know she added for the enlightenment of those who
might not be versed in Italian heraldry Then she continued just
before the murder of the King and Queen of Servia I had a vivid dream of
two crowned figures walking into a slaughterhouse by the banks of a big
river which I took to be the Danube and only the other day

Do tell us what youve dreamt about the Derby interrupted Odo
impatiently

Well I saw the finish of the race as clearly as anything and one horse
won easily almost in a canter and everybody cried out Bread and Butter
wins Good old Bread and Butter I heard the name distinctly and Ive
had the same dream two nights running

Bread and Butter said Mrs de Claux now whatever horse can that
point to Whyof course Nursery Tea

She looked round with the triumphant smile of a successful unraveller of
mystery

How about Le Five OClock interposed Sir Lulworth

It would fit either of them equally well said Odo can you remember
any details about the jockeys colours That might help us

I seem to remember a glimpse of lemon sleeves or cap but I cant be
sure said Lola after due reflection

There isnt a lemon jacket or cap in the race said Bertie referring
to a list of starters and jockeys cant you remember anything about the
appearance of the horse If it were a thickset animal this bread and
butter would typify Nursery Tea and if it were thin of course it would
mean Le Five OClock

That seems sound enough said Mrs de Claux do think Lola dear
whether the horse in your dream was thin or stoutly built

I cant remember that it was one or the other said Lola one wouldnt
notice such a detail in the excitement of a finish

But this was a symbolic animal said Sir Lulworth if it were to
typify thick or thin bread and butter surely it ought to have been either
as bulky and tubby as a shire carthorse or as thin as a heraldic
leopard

Im afraid you are rather a careless dreamer said Bertie resentfully

Of course at the moment of dreaming I thought I was witnessing a real
race not the portent of one said Lola otherwise I should have
particularly noticed all helpful details

The Derby isnt run till tomorrow said Mrs de Claux do you think
you are likely to have the same dream again tonight If so you can fix
your attention on the important detail of the animals appearance

Im afraid I shant sleep at all tonight said Lola pathetically
every fifth night I suffer from insomnia and its due tonight

Its most provoking said Bertie of course we can back both horses
but it would be much more satisfactory to have all our money on the
winner Cant you take a sleepingdraught or something

Oakleaves soaked in warm water and put under the bed are recommended
by some said Mrs de Claux

A glass of Benedictine with a drop of eaudeCologne said Sir
Lulworth

I have tried every known remedy said Lola with dignity Ive been a
martyr to insomnia for years

But now we are being martyrs to it said Odo sulkily I particularly
want to land a big coup over this race

I dont have insomnia for my own amusement snapped Lola

Let us hope for the best said Mrs de Claux soothingly tonight may
prove an exception to the fifthnight rule

But when breakfast time came round again Lola reported a blank night as
far as visions were concerned

I dont suppose I had as much as ten minutes sleep and certainly no
dreams

Im so sorry for your sake in the first place and ours as well said
her hostess do you think you could induce a short nap after breakfast
It would be so good for youand you _might_ dream something There
would still be time for us to get our bets on

Ill try if you like said Lola it sounds rather like a small child
being sent to bed in disgrace

Ill come and read the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ to you if you think it
will make you sleep any sooner said Bertie obligingly

Rain was falling too steadily to permit of outdoor amusement and the
party suffered considerably during the next two hours from the absolute
quiet that was enforced all over the house in order to give Lola every
chance of achieving slumber Even the click of billiard balls was
considered a possible factor of disturbance and the canaries were
carried down to the gardeners lodge while the cuckoo clock in the hall
was muffled under several layers of rugs A notice Please do not Knock
or Ring was posted on the front door at Berties suggestion and guests
and servants spoke in tragic whispers as though the dread presence of
death or sickness had invaded the house The precautions proved of no
avail Lola added a sleepless morning to a wakeful night and the bets of
the party had to be impartially divided between Nursery Tea and the
French Colt

So provoking to have to split out bets said Mrs de Claux as her
guests gathered in the hall later in the day waiting for the result of
the race

I did my best for you said Lola feeling that she was not getting her
due share of gratitude I told you what I had seen in my dreams a brown
horse called Bread and Butter winning easily from all the rest

What screamed Bertie jumping up from his sea a _brown_ horse
Miserable woman you never said a word about its being a brown horse

Didnt I faltered Lola I thought I told you it was a brown horse It
was certainly brown in both dreams But I dont see what the colour has
got to do with it Nursery Tea and Le Five OClock are both chestnuts

Merciful Heaven Doesnt brown bread and butter with a sprinkling of
lemon in the colours suggest anything to you raged Bertie

A slow cumulative groan broke from the assembly as the meaning of his
words gradually dawned on his hearers

For the second time that day Lola retired to the seclusion of her room
she could not face the universal looks of reproach directed at her when
Whitebait was announced winner at the comfortable price of fourteen to
one




BERTIES CHRISTMAS EVE


It was Christmas Eve and the family circle of Luke Steffink Esq was
aglow with the amiability and random mirth which the occasion demanded A
long and lavish dinner had been partaken of waits had been round and
sung carols the houseparty had regaled itself with more caroling on its
own account and there had been romping which even in a pulpit
reference could not have been condemned as ragging In the midst of the
general glow however there was one black unkindled cinder

Bertie Steffink nephew of the aforementioned Luke had early in life
adopted the profession of neerdoweel his father had been something of
the kind before him At the age of eighteen Bertie had commenced that
round of visits to our Colonial possessions so seemly and desirable in
the case of a Prince of the Blood so suggestive of insincerity in a
young man of the middleclass He had gone to grow tea in Ceylon and
fruit in British Columbia and to help sheep to grow wool in Australia
At the age of twenty he had just returned from some similar errand in
Canada from which it may be gathered that the trial he gave to these
various experiments was of the summary drumhead nature Luke Steffink
who fulfilled the troubled role of guardian and deputyparent to Bertie
deplored the persistent manifestation of the homing instinct on his
nephews part and his solemn thanks earlier in the day for the blessing
of reporting a united family had no reference to Berties return

Arrangements had been promptly made for packing the youth off to a
distant corner of Rhodesia whence return would be a difficult matter
the journey to this uninviting destination was imminent in fact a more
careful and willing traveller would have already begun to think about his
packing Hence Bertie was in no mood to share in the festive spirit
which displayed itself around him and resentment smouldered within him
at the eager selfabsorbed discussion of social plans for the coming
months which he heard on all sides Beyond depressing his uncle and the
family circle generally by singing Say au revoir and not goodbye he
had taken no part in the evenings conviviality

Eleven oclock had struck some halfhour ago and the elder Steffinks
began to throw out suggestions leading up to that process which they
called retiring for the night

Come Teddie its time you were in your little bed you know said
Luke Steffink to his thirteenyearold son

Thats where we all ought to be said Mrs Steffink

There wouldnt be room said Bertie

The remark was considered to border on the scandalous everybody ate
raisins and almonds with the nervous industry of sheep feeding during
threatening weather

In Russia said Horace Bordenby who was staying in the house as a
Christmas guest Ive read that the peasants believe that if you go into
a cowhouse or stable at midnight on Christmas Eve you will hear the
animals talk Theyre supposed to have the gift of speech at that one
moment of the year

Oh _do_ lets _all_ go down to the cowhouse and listen to what theyve
got to say exclaimed Beryl to whom anything was thrilling and amusing
if you did it in a troop

Mrs Steffink made a laughing protest but gave a virtual consent by
saying We must all wrap up well then The idea seemed a
scatterbrained one to her and almost heathenish but if afforded an
opportunity for throwing the young people together and as such she
welcomed it Mr Horace Bordenby was a young man with quite substantial
prospects and he had danced with Beryl at a local subscription ball a
sufficient number of times to warrant the authorised inquiry on the part
of the neighbours whether there was anything in it Though Mrs
Steffink would not have put it in so many words she shared the idea of
the Russian peasantry that on this night the beast might speak

The cowhouse stood at the junction of the garden with a small paddock
an isolated survival in a suburban neighbourhood of what had once been
a small farm Luke Steffink was complacently proud of his cowhouse and
his two cows he felt that they gave him a stamp of solidity which no
number of Wyandottes or Orpingtons could impart They even seemed to
link him in a sort of inconsequent way with those patriarchs who derived
importance from their floating capital of flocks and herbs heasses and
sheasses It had been an anxious and momentous occasion when he had had
to decide definitely between the Byre and the Ranch for the naming of
his villa residence A December midnight was hardly the moment he would
have chosen for showing his farmbuilding to visitors but since it was a
fine night and the young people were anxious for an excuse for a mild
frolic Luke consented to chaperon the expedition The servants had long
since gone to bed so the house was left in charge of Bertie who
scornfully declined to stir out on the pretext of listening to bovine
conversation

We must go quietly said Luke as he headed the procession of giggling
young folk brought up in the rear by the shawled and hooded figure of
Mrs Steffink Ive always laid stress on keeping this a quiet and
orderly neighbourhood

It was a few minutes to midnight when the party reached the cowhouse and
made its way in by the light of Lukes stable lantern For a moment
every one stood in silence almost with a feeling of being in church

Daisythe one lying downis by a shorthorn bull out of a Guernsey
cow announced Luke in a hushed voice which was in keeping with the
foregoing impression

Is she said Bordenby rather as if he had expected her to be by
Rembrandt

Myrtle is

Myrtles family history was cut short by a little scream from the women
of the party

The cowhouse door had closed noiselessly behind them and the key had
turned gratingly in the lock then they heard Berties voice pleasantly
wishing them goodnight and his footsteps retreating along the garden
path

Luke Steffink strode to the window it was a small square opening of the
oldfashioned sort with iron bars let into the stonework

Unlock the door this instant he shouted with as much air of menacing
authority as a hen might assume when screaming through the bars of a coop
at a marauding hawk In reply to his summons the halldoor closed with a
defiant bang

A neighbouring clock struck the hour of midnight If the cows had
received the gift of human speech at that moment they would not have been
able to make themselves heard Seven or eight other voices were engaged
in describing Berties present conduct and his general character at a
high pressure of excitement and indignation

In the course of half an hour or so everything that it was permissible to
say about Bertie had been said some dozens of times and other topics
began to come to the frontthe extreme mustiness of the cowhouse the
possibility of it catching fire and the probability of it being a Rowton
House for the vagrant rats of the neighbourhood And still no sign of
deliverance came to the unwilling vigilkeepers

Towards one oclock the sound of rather boisterous and undisciplined
carolsinging approached rapidly and came to a sudden anchorage
apparently just outside the gardengate A motorload of youthful
bloods in a high state of conviviality had made a temporary halt for
repairs the stoppage however did not extend to the vocal efforts of
the party and the watchers in the cowshed were treated to a highly
unauthorised rendering of Good King Wenceslas in which the adjective
good appeared to be very carelessly applied

The noise had the effect of bringing Bertie out into the garden but he
utterly ignored the pale angry faces peering out at the cowhouse
window and concentrated his attention on the revellers outside the gate

Wassail you chaps he shouted

Wassail old sport they shouted back wed jolly well drink yr
health only weve nothing to drink it in

Come and wassail inside said Bertie hospitably Im all alone and
theres heaps of wet

They were total strangers but his touch of kindness made them instantly
his kin In another moment the unauthorised version of King Wenceslas
which like many other scandals grew worse on repetition went echoing
up the garden path two of the revellers gave an impromptu performance on
the way by executing the staircase waltz up the terraces of what Luke
Steffink hitherto with some justification called his rockgarden The
rock part of it was still there when the waltz had been accorded its
third encore Luke more than ever like a cooped hen behind the
cowhouse bars was in a position to realise the feelings of
concertgoers unable to countermand the call for an encore which they
neither desire or deserve

The hall door closed with a bang on Berties guests and the sounds of
merriment became faint and muffled to the weary watchers at the other end
of the garden Presently two ominous pops in quick succession made
themselves distinctly heard

Theyve got at the champagne exclaimed Mrs Steffink

Perhaps its the sparkling Moselle said Luke hopefully

Three or four more pops were heard

The champagne _and_ the sparkling Moselle said Mrs Steffink

Luke uncorked an expletive which like brandy in a temperance household
was only used on rare emergencies Mr Horace Bordenby had been making
use of similar expressions under his breath for a considerable time past
The experiment of throwing the young people together had been prolonged
beyond a point when it was likely to produce any romantic result

Some forty minutes later the hall door opened and disgorged a crowd that
had thrown off any restraint of shyness that might have influenced its
earlier actions Its vocal efforts in the direction of carol singing
were now supplemented by instrumental music a Christmastree that had
been prepared for the children of the gardener and other household
retainers had yielded a rich spoil of tin trumpets rattles and drums
The lifestory of King Wenceslas had been dropped Luke was thankful to
notice but it was intensely irritating for the chilled prisoners in the
cowhouse to be told that it was a hot time in the old town tonight
together with some accurate but entirely superfluous information as to
the imminence of Christmas morning Judging by the protests which began
to be shouted from the upper windows of neighbouring houses the
sentiments prevailing in the cowhouse were heartily echoed in other
quarters

The revellers found their car and what was more remarkable managed to
drive off in it with a parting fanfare of tin trumpets The lively beat
of a drum disclosed the fact that the master of the revels remained on
the scene

Bertie came in an angry imploring chorus of shouts and screams from
the cowhouse window

Hullo cried the owner of the name turning his rather errant steps in
the direction of the summons are you people still there Must have
heard everything cows got to say by this time If you havent no use
waiting After all its a Russian legend and Russian Chrismush Eve not
due for nother fortnight Better come out

After one or two ineffectual attempts he managed to pitch the key of the
cowhouse door in through the window Then lifting his voice in the
strains of Im afraid to go home in the dark with a lusty drum
accompaniment he led the way back to the house The hurried procession
of the released that followed in his steps came in for a good deal of the
adverse comment that his exuberant display had evoked

It was the happiest Christmas Eve he had ever spent To quote his own
words he had a rotten Christmas




FOREWARNED


Alethia Debchance sat in a corner of an otherwise empty railway carriage
more or less at ease as regarded body but in some trepidation as to
mind She had embarked on a social adventure of no little magnitude as
compared with the accustomed seclusion and stagnation of her past life
At the age of twentyeight she could look back on nothing more eventful
than the daily round of her existence in her aunts house at
Webblehinton a hamlet four and a half miles distant from a country town
and about a quarter of a century removed from modern times Their
neighbours had been elderly and few not much given to social
intercourse but helpful or politely sympathetic in times of illness
Newspapers of the ordinary kind were a rarity those that Alethia saw
regularly were devoted exclusively either to religion or to poultry and
the world of politics was to her an unheeded unexplored region Her
ideas on life in general had been acquired through the medium of popular
respectable novelwriters and modified or emphasised by such knowledge
as her aunt the vicar and her aunts housekeeper had put at her
disposal And now in her twentyninth year her aunts death had left
her well provided for as regards income but somewhat isolated in the
matter of kith and kin and human companionship She had some cousins who
were on terms of friendly though infrequent correspondence with her
but as they lived permanently in Ceylon a locality about which she knew
little beyond the assurance contained in the missionary hymn that the
human element there was vile they were not of much immediate use to her
Other cousins she also possessed more distant as regards relationship
but not quite so geographically remote seeing that they lived somewhere
in the Midlands She could hardly remember ever having met them but
once or twice in the course of the last three or four years they had
expressed a polite wish that she should pay them a visit they had
probably not been unduly depressed by the fact that her aunts failing
health had prevented her from accepting their invitation The note of
condolence that had arrived on the occasion of her aunts death had
included a vague hope that Alethia would find time in the near future to
spend a few days with her cousins and after much deliberation and many
hesitations she had written to propose herself as a guest for a definite
date some week ahead The family she reflected with relief was not a
large one the two daughters were married and away there was only old
Mrs Bludward and her son Robert at home Mrs Bludward was something of
an invalid and Robert was a young man who had been at Oxford and was
going into Parliament Further than that Alethias information did not
go her imagination founded on her extensive knowledge of the people one
met in novels had to supply the gaps The mother was not difficult to
place she would either be an ultraamiable old lady bearing her feeble
health with uncomplaining fortitude and having a kind word for the
gardeners boy and a sunny smile for the chance visitor or else she
would be cold and peevish with eyes that pierced you like a gimlet and
a unreasoning idolatry of her son Alethias imagination rather inclined
her to the latter view Robert was more of a problem There were three
dominant types of manhood to be taken into consideration in working out
his classification there was Hugo who was strong good and beautiful
a rare type and not very often met with there was Sir Jasper who was
utterly vile and absolutely unscrupulous and there was Nevil who was
not really bad at heart but had a weak mouth and usually required the
lifework of two good women to keep him from ultimate disaster It was
probable Alethia considered that Robert came into the last category in
which case she was certain to enjoy the companionship of one or two
excellent women and might possibly catch glimpses of undesirable
adventuresses or come face to face with reckless admirationseeking
married women It was altogether an exciting prospect this sudden
venture into an unexplored world of unknown human beings and Alethia
rather wished that she could have taken the vicar with her she was not
however rich or important enough to travel with a chaplain as the
Marquis of Moystoncleugh always did in the novel she had just been
reading so she recognised that such a proceeding was out of the
question

The train which carried Alethia towards her destination was a local one
with the wayside station habit strongly developed At most of the
stations no one seemed to want to get into the train or to leave it but
at one there were several market folk on the platform and two men of
the farmer or small cattledealer class entered Alethias carriage
Apparently they had just foregathered after a days business and their
conversation consisted of a rapid exchange of short friendly inquiries as
to health family stock and so forth and some grumbling remarks on the
weather Suddenly however their talk took a dramatically interesting
turn and Alethia listened with wideeyed attention

What do you think of Mister Robert Bludward eh

There was a certain scornful ring in his question

Robert Bludward An outanout rotter thats what he is Ought to be
ashamed to look any decent man in the face Send him to Parliament to
represent usnot much Hed rob a poor man of his last shilling he
would

Ah that he would Tells a pack of lies to get our votes thats all
that hes after damn him Did you see the way the _Argus_ showed him up
this week Properly exposed him hip and thigh I tell you

And so on they ran in their withering indictment There could be no
doubt that it was Alethias cousin and prospective host to whom they were
referring the allusion to a Parliamentary candidature settled that What
could Robert Bludward have done what manner of man could he be that
people should speak of him with such obvious reprobation

He was hissed down at Shoalford yesterday said one of the speakers

Hissed Had it come to that There was something dramatically biblical
in the idea of Robert Bludwards neighbours and acquaintances hissing him
for very scorn Lord Hereward Stranglath had been hissed now Alethia
came to think of it in the eighth chapter of _Matterby Towers_ while in
the act of opening a Wesleyan bazaar because he was suspected unjustly
as it turned out afterwards of having beaten the German governess to
death And in _Tainted Guineas_ Roper Squenderby had been deservedly
hissed on the steps of the Jockey Club for having handed a rival owner
a forged telegram containing false news of his mothers death just
before the start for an important race thereby ensuring the withdrawal
of his rivals horse In placid Saxonblooded England people did not
demonstrate their feelings lightly and without some strong compelling
cause What manner of evildoer was Robert Bludward

The train stopped at another small station and the two men got out One
of them left behind him a copy of the _Argus_ the local paper to which
he had made reference Alethia pounced on it in the expectation of
finding a cultured literary endorsement of the censure which these rough
farming men had expressed in their homely honest way She had not far
to look Mr Robert Bludward Swanker was the title of one of the
principal articles in the paper She did not exactly know what a swanker
was probably it referred to some unspeakable form of cruelty but she
read enough in the first few sentences of the article to discover that
her cousin Robert the man at whose house she was about to stay was an
unscrupulous unprincipled character of a low order of intelligence yet
cunning withal and that he and his associates were responsible for most
of the misery disease poverty and ignorance with which the country was
afflicted never except in one or two of the denunciatory Psalms which
she had always supposed to have be written in a spirit of exaggerated
Oriental imagery had she read such an indictment of a human being And
this monster was going to meet her at Derrelton Station in a few short
minutes She would know him at once he would have the dark beetling
brows the quick furtive glance the sneering unsavoury smile that
always characterised the Sir Jaspers of this world It was too late to
escape she must force herself to meet him with outward calm

It was a considerable shock to her to find that Robert was fair with a
snub nose merry eye and rather a schoolboy manner A serpent in
ducklings plumage was her private comment merciful chance had
revealed him to her in his true colours

As they drove away from the station a dissipatedlooking man of the
labouring class waved his hat in friendly salute Good luck to you Mr
Bludward he shouted youll come out on top Well break old
Chobhams neck for him

Who was that man asked Alethia quickly

Oh one of my supporters laughed Robert a bit of a poacher and a bit
of a publoafer but hes on the right side

So these were the sort of associates that Robert Bludward consorted with
thought Alethia

Who is the person he referred to as old Chobham she asked

Sir John Chobham the man who is opposing me answered Robert that is
his house away there among the trees on the right

So there was an upright man possibly a very Hugo in character who was
thwarting and defying the evildoer in his nefarious career and there was
a dastardly plot afoot to break his neck Possibly the attempt would be
made within the next few hours He must certainly be warned Alethia
remembered how Lady Sylvia Broomgate in _Nightshade Court_ had
pretended to be bolted with by her horse up to the front door of a
threatened county magnate and had whispered a warning in his ear which
saved him from being the victim of foul murder She wondered if there
was a quiet pony in the stables on which she would be allowed to ride out
alone The chances were that she would be watched Robert would come
spurring after her and seize her bridle just as she was turning in at Sir
Johns gates

A group of men that they passed in a village street gave them no very
friendly looks and Alethia thought she heard a furtive hiss a moment
later they came upon an errand boy riding a bicycle He had the frank
open countenance neatly brushed hair and tidy clothes that betoken a
clear conscience and a good mother He stared straight at the occupants
of the car and after he had passed them sang in his clear boyish
voice

Well hang Bobby Bludward on the sour apple tree

Robert merely laughed That was how he took the scorn and condemnation
of his fellowmen He had goaded them to desperation with his shameless
depravity till they spoke openly of putting him to a violent death and
he laughed

Mrs Bludward proved to be of the type that Alethia had suspected thin
lipped coldeyed and obviously devoted to her worthless son From her
no help was to be expected Alethia locked her door that night and
placed such ramparts of furniture against it that the maid had great
difficulty in breaking in with the early tea in the morning

After breakfast Alethia on the pretext of going to look at an outlying
rosegarden slipped away to the village through which they had passed on
the previous evening She remembered that Robert had pointed out to her
a public readingroom and here she considered it possible that she might
meet Sir John Chobham or some one who knew him well and would carry a
message to him The room was empty when she entered it a _Graphic_
twelve days old a yet older copy of _Punch_ and one or two local papers
lay upon the central table the other tables were stacked for the most
part with chess and draughtsboards and wooden boxes of chessmen and
dominoes Listlessly she picked up one of the papers the _Sentinel_
and glanced at its contents Suddenly she started and began to read
with breathless attention a prominently printed article headed A Little
Limelight on Sir John Chobham The colour ebbed away from her face a
look of frightened despair crept into her eyes Never in any novel that
she had read had a defenceless young woman been confronted with a
situation like this Sir John the Hugo of her imagination was if
anything rather more depraved and despicable than Robert Bludward He
was mean evasive callously indifferent to his countrys interests a
cheat a man who habitually broke his word and who was responsible with
his associates for most of the poverty misery crime and national
degradation with which the country was afflicted He was also a
candidate for Parliament it seemed and as there was only one seat in
this particular locality it was obvious that the success of either
Robert or Sir John would mean a check to the ambitions of the other
hence no doubt the rivalry and enmity between these otherwise kindred
souls One was seeking to have his enemy done to death the other was
apparently trying to stir up his supporters to an act of Lynch law All
this in order that there might be an unopposed election that one or
other of the candidates might go into Parliament with honeyed eloquence
on his lips and blood on his heart Were men really so vile

I must go back to Webblehinton at once Alethia informed her astonished
hostess at lunch time I have had a telegram A friend is very
seriously ill and I have been sent for

It was dreadful to have to concoct lies but it would be more dreadful to
have to spend another night under that roof

Alethia reads novels now with even greater appreciation than before She
has been herself in the world outside Webblehinton the world where the
great dramas of sin and villainy are played unceasingly She had come
unscathed through it but what might have happened if she had gone
unsuspectingly to visit Sir John Chobham and warn him of his danger What
indeed She had been saved by the fearless outspokenness of the local
Press




THE INTERLOPERS


In a forest of mixed growth somewhere on the eastern spurs of the
Karpathians a man stood one winter night watching and listening as
though he waited for some beast of the woods to come within the range of
his vision and later of his rifle But the game for whose presence he
kept so keen an outlook was none that figured in the sportsmans calendar
as lawful and proper for the chase Ulrich von Gradwitz patrolled the
dark forest in quest of a human enemy

The forest lands of Gradwitz were of wide extent and well stocked with
game the narrow strip of precipitous woodland that lay on its outskirt
was not remarkable for the game it harboured or the shooting it afforded
but it was the most jealously guarded of all its owners territorial
possessions A famous law suit in the days of his grandfather had
wrested it from the illegal possession of a neighbouring family of petty
landowners the dispossessed party had never acquiesced in the judgment
of the Courts and a long series of poaching affrays and similar scandals
had embittered the relationships between the families for three
generations The neighbour feud had grown into a personal one since
Ulrich had come to be head of his family if there was a man in the world
whom he detested and wished ill to it was Georg Znaeym the inheritor of
the quarrel and the tireless gamesnatcher and raider of the disputed
borderforest The feud might perhaps have died down or been
compromised if the personal illwill of the two men had not stood in the
way as boys they had thirsted for one anothers blood as men each
prayed that misfortune might fall on the other and this windscourged
winter night Ulrich had banded together his foresters to watch the dark
forest not in quest of fourfooted quarry but to keep a lookout for
the prowling thieves whom he suspected of being afoot from across the
land boundary The roebuck which usually kept in the sheltered hollows
during a stormwind were running like driven things tonight and there
was movement and unrest among the creatures that were wont to sleep
through the dark hours Assuredly there was a disturbing element in the
forest and Ulrich could guess the quarter from whence it came

He strayed away by himself from the watchers whom he had placed in ambush
on the crest of the hill and wandered far down the steep slopes amid the
wild tangle of undergrowth peering through the tree trunks and listening
through the whistling and skirling of the wind and the restless beating
of the branches for sight and sound of the marauders If only on this
wild night in this dark lone spot he might come across Georg Znaeym
man to man with none to witnessthat was the wish that was uppermost in
his thoughts And as he stepped round the trunk of a huge beech he came
face to face with the man he sought

The two enemies stood glaring at one another for a long silent moment
Each had a rifle in his hand each had hate in his heart and murder
uppermost in his mind The chance had come to give full play to the
passions of a lifetime But a man who has been brought up under the code
of a restraining civilisation cannot easily nerve himself to shoot down
his neighbour in cold blood and without word spoken except for an
offence against his hearth and honour And before the moment of
hesitation had given way to action a deed of Natures own violence
overwhelmed them both A fierce shriek of the storm had been answered by
a splitting crash over their heads and ere they could leap aside a mass
of falling beech tree had thundered down on them Ulrich von Gradwitz
found himself stretched on the ground one arm numb beneath him and the
other held almost as helplessly in a tight tangle of forked branches
while both legs were pinned beneath the fallen mass His heavy shooting
boots had saved his feet from being crushed to pieces but if his
fractures were not as serious as they might have been at least it was
evident that he could not move from his present position till some one
came to release him The descending twig had slashed the skin of his
face and he had to wink away some drops of blood from his eyelashes
before he could take in a general view of the disaster At his side so
near that under ordinary circumstances he could almost have touched him
lay Georg Znaeym alive and struggling but obviously as helplessly
pinioned down as himself All round them lay a thickstrewn wreckage of
splintered branches and broken twigs

Relief at being alive and exasperation at his captive plight brought a
strange medley of pious thankofferings and sharp curses to Ulrichs
lips Georg who was early blinded with the blood which trickled across
his eyes stopped his struggling for a moment to listen and then gave a
short snarling laugh

So youre not killed as you ought to be but youre caught anyway he
cried caught fast Ho what a jest Ulrich von Gradwitz snared in his
stolen forest Theres real justice for you

And he laughed again mockingly and savagely

Im caught in my own forestland retorted Ulrich When my men come
to release us you will wish perhaps that you were in a better plight
than caught poaching on a neighbours land shame on you

Georg was silent for a moment then he answered quietly

Are you sure that your men will find much to release I have men too
in the forest tonight close behind me and _they_ will be here first
and do the releasing When they drag me out from under these damned
branches it wont need much clumsiness on their part to roll this mass of
trunk right over on the top of you Your men will find you dead under a
fallen beech tree For forms sake I shall send my condolences to your
family

It is a useful hint said Ulrich fiercely My men had orders to
follow in ten minutes time seven of which must have gone by already and
when they get me outI will remember the hint Only as you will have
met your death poaching on my lands I dont think I can decently send any
message of condolence to your family

Good snarled Georg good We fight this quarrel out to the death
you and I and our foresters with no cursed interlopers to come between
us Death and damnation to you Ulrich von Gradwitz

The same to you Georg Znaeym forestthief gamesnatcher

Both men spoke with the bitterness of possible defeat before them for
each knew that it might be long before his men would seek him out or find
him it was a bare matter of chance which party would arrive first on the
scene

Both had now given up the useless struggle to free themselves from the
mass of wood that held them down Ulrich limited his endeavours to an
effort to bring his one partially free arm near enough to his outer coat
pocket to draw out his wineflask Even when he had accomplished that
operation it was long before he could manage the unscrewing of the
stopper or get any of the liquid down his throat But what a Heavensent
draught it seemed It was an open winter and little snow had fallen as
yet hence the captives suffered less from the cold than might have been
the case at that season of the year nevertheless the wine was warming
and reviving to the wounded man and he looked across with something like
a throb of pity to where his enemy lay just keeping the groans of pain
and weariness from crossing his lips

Could you reach this flask if I threw it over to you asked Ulrich
suddenly there is good wine in it and one may as well be as
comfortable as one can Let us drink even if tonight one of us dies

No I can scarcely see anything there is so much blood caked round my
eyes said Georg and in any case I dont drink wine with an enemy

Ulrich was silent for a few minutes and lay listening to the weary
screeching of the wind An idea was slowly forming and growing in his
brain an idea that gained strength every time that he looked across at
the man who was fighting so grimly against pain and exhaustion In the
pain and languor that Ulrich himself was feeling the old fierce hatred
seemed to be dying down

Neighbour he said presently do as you please if your men come first
It was a fair compact But as for me Ive changed my mind If my men
are the first to come you shall be the first to be helped as though you
were my guest We have quarrelled like devils all our lives over this
stupid strip of forest where the trees cant even stand upright in a
breath of wind Lying here tonight thinking Ive come to think weve
been rather fools there are better things in life than getting the
better of a boundary dispute Neighbour if you will help me to bury the
old quarrel II will ask you to be my friend

Georg Znaeym was silent for so long that Ulrich thought perhaps he had
fainted with the pain of his injuries Then he spoke slowly and in
jerks

How the whole region would stare and gabble if we rode into the market
square together No one living can remember seeing a Znaeym and a von
Gradwitz talking to one another in friendship And what peace there
would be among the forester folk if we ended our feud tonight And if
we choose to make peace among our people there is none other to
interfere no interlopers from outside    You would come and keep the
Sylvester night beneath my roof and I would come and feast on some high
day at your castle    I would never fire a shot on your land save
when you invited me as a guest and you should come and shoot with me
down in the marshes where the wildfowl are In all the countryside there
are none that could hinder if we willed to make peace I never thought
to have wanted to do other than hate you all my life but I think I have
changed my mind about things too this last halfhour And you offered
me your wineflask    Ulrich von Gradwitz I will be your friend

For a space both men were silent turning over in their minds the
wonderful changes that this dramatic reconciliation would bring about In
the cold gloomy forest with the wind tearing in fitful gusts through
the naked branches and whistling round the treetrunks they lay and
waited for the help that would now bring release and succour to both
parties And each prayed a private prayer that his men might be the
first to arrive so that he might be the first to show honourable
attention to the enemy that had become a friend

Presently as the wind dropped for a moment Ulrich broke silence

Lets shout for help he said in this lull our voices may
carry a little way

They wont carry far through the trees and undergrowth said Georg
but we can try Together then

The two raised their voices in a prolonged hunting call

Together again said Ulrich a few minutes later after listening in
vain for an answering halloo

I heard nothing but the pestilential wind said Georg hoarsely

There was silence again for some minutes and then Ulrich gave a joyful
cry

I can see figures coming through the wood They are following in the
way I came down the hillside

Both men raised their voices in as loud a shout as they could muster

They hear us Theyve stopped Now they see us Theyre running down
the hill towards us cried Ulrich

How many of them are there asked Georg

I cant see distinctly said Ulrich nine or ten

Then they are yours said Georg I had only seven out with me

They are making all the speed they can brave lads said Ulrich gladly

Are they your men asked Georg Are they your men he repeated
impatiently as Ulrich did not answer

No said Ulrich with a laugh the idiotic chattering laugh of a man
unstrung with hideous fear

Who are they asked Georg quickly straining his eyes to see what the
other would gladly not have seen

_Wolves_




QUAIL SEED


The outlook is not encouraging for us smaller businesses said Mr
Scarrick to the artist and his sister who had taken rooms over his
suburban grocery store These big concerns are offering all sorts of
attractions to the shopping public which we couldnt afford to imitate
even on a small scalereadingrooms and playrooms and gramophones and
Heaven knows what People dont care to buy half a pound of sugar
nowadays unless they can listen to Harry Lauder and have the latest
Australian cricket scores ticked off before their eyes With the big
Christmas stock weve got in we ought to keep half a dozen assistants
hard at work but as it is my nephew Jimmy and myself can pretty well
attend to it ourselves Its a nice stock of goods too if I could only
run it off in a few weeks time but theres no chance of thatnot unless
the London line was to get snowed up for a fortnight before Christmas I
did have a sort of idea of engaging Miss Luffcombe to give recitations
during afternoons she made a great hit at the Post Office entertainment
with her rendering of Little Beatrices Resolve

Anything less likely to make your shop a fashionable shopping centre I
cant imagine said the artist with a very genuine shudder if I were
trying to decide between the merits of Carlsbad plums and confected figs
as a winter dessert it would infuriate me to have my train of thought
entangled with little Beatrices resolve to be an Angel of Light or a
girl scout No he continued the desire to get something thrown in
for nothing is a ruling passion with the feminine shopper but you cant
afford to pander effectively to it Why not appeal to another instinct
which dominates not only the woman shopper but the male shopperin fact
the entire human race

What is that instinct sir said the grocer

    

Mrs Greyes and Miss Fritten had missed the 218 to Town and as there
was not another train till 312 they thought that they might as well make
their grocery purchases at Scarricks It would not be sensational they
agreed but it would still be shopping

For some minutes they had the shop almost to themselves as far as
customers were concerned but while they were debating the respective
virtues and blemishes of two competing brands of anchovy paste they were
startled by an order given across the counter for six pomegranates and
a packet of quail seed Neither commodity was in general demand in that
neighbourhood Equally unusual was the style and appearance of the
customer about sixteen years old with dark olive skin large dusky
eyes and think lowgrowing blueblack hair he might have made his
living as an artists model As a matter of fact he did The bowl of
beaten brass that he produced for the reception of his purchases was
distinctly the most astonishing variation on the string bag or marketing
basket of suburban civilisation that his fellowshoppers had ever seen
He threw a gold piece apparently of some exotic currency across the
counter and did not seem disposed to wait for any change that might be
forthcoming

The wine and figs were not paid for yesterday he said keep what is
over of the money for our future purchases

A very strangelooking boy said Mrs Greyes interrogatively to the
grocer as soon as his customer had left

A foreigner I believe said Mr Scarrick with a shortness that was
entirely out of keeping with his usually communicative manner

I wish for a pound and a half of the best coffee you have said an
authoritative voice a moment or two later The speaker was a tall
authoritativelooking man of rather outlandish aspect remarkable among
other things for a full black beard worn in a style more in vogue in
early Assyria than in a London suburb of the present day

Has a darkfaced boy been here buying pomegranates he asked suddenly
as the coffee was being weighed out to him

The two ladies almost jumped on hearing the grocer reply with an
unblushing negative

We have a few pomegranates in stock he continued but there has been
no demand for them

My servant will fetch the coffee as usual said the purchaser
producing a coin from a wonderful metalwork purse As an apparent
afterthought he fired out the question Have you perhaps any quail
seed

No said the grocer without hesitation we dont stock it

What will he deny next asked Mrs Greyes under her breath What made
it seem so much worse was the fact that Mr Scarrick had quite recently
presided at a lecture on Savonarola

Turning up the deep astrachan collar of his long coat the stranger swept
out of the shop with the air Miss Fritten afterwards described it of a
Satrap proroguing a Sanhedrim Whether such a pleasant function ever
fell to a Satraps lot she was not quite certain but the simile
faithfully conveyed her meaning to a large circle of acquaintances

Dont lets bother about the 312 said Mrs Greyes lets go and talk
this over at Laura Lippings Its her day

When the darkfaced boy arrived at the shop next day with his brass
marketing bowl there was quite a fair gathering of customers most of
whom seemed to be spinning out their purchasing operations with the air
of people who had very little to do with their time In a voice that was
heard all over the shop perhaps because everybody was intently
listening he asked for a pound of honey and a packet of quail seed

More quail seed said Miss Fritten Those quails must be voracious
or else it isnt quail seed at all

I believe its opium and the bearded man is a detective said Mrs
Greyes brilliantly

I dont said Laura Lipping Im sure its something to do with the
Portuguese Throne

More likely to be a Persian intrigue on behalf of the exShah said
Miss Fritten the bearded man belongs to the Government Party The
quailseed is a countersign of course Persia is almost next door to
Palestine and quails come into the Old Testament you know

Only as a miracle said her wellinformed younger sister Ive thought
all along it was part of a love intrigue

The boy who had so much interest and speculation centred on him was on
the point of departing with his purchases when he was waylaid by Jimmy
the nephewapprentice who from his post at the cheese and bacon
counter commanded a good view of the street

We have some very fine Jaffa oranges he said hurriedly pointing to a
corner where they were stored behind a high rampart of biscuit tins
There was evidently more in the remark than met the ear The boy flew at
the oranges with the enthusiasm of a ferret finding a rabbit family at
home after a long day of fruitless subterranean research Almost at the
same moment the bearded stranger stalked into the shop and flung an
order for a pound of dates and a tin of the best Smyrna halva across the
counter The most adventurous housewife in the locality had never heard
of halva but Mr Scarrick was apparently able to produce the best Smyrna
variety of it without a moments hesitation

We might be living in the Arabian Nights said Miss Fritten excitedly

Hush Listen beseeched Mrs Greyes

Has the darkfaced boy of whom I spoke yesterday been here today
asked the stranger

Weve had rather more people than usual in the shop today said Mr
Scarrick but I cant recall a boy such as you describe

Mrs Greyes and Miss Fritten looked round triumphantly at their friends
It was of course deplorable that any one should treat the truth as an
article temporarily and excusably out of stock but they felt gratified
that the vivid accounts they had given of Mr Scarricks traffic in
falsehoods should receive confirmation at first hand

I shall never again be able to believe what he tells me about the
absence of colouring matter in the jam whispered an aunt of Mrs Greyes
tragically

The mysterious stranger took his departure Laura Lipping distinctly saw
a snarl of baffled rage reveal itself behind his heavy moustache and
upturned astrachan collar After a cautious interval the seeker after
oranges emerged from behind the biscuit tins having apparently failed to
find any individual orange that satisfied his requirements He too
took his departure and the shop was slowly emptied of its parcel and
gossip laden customers It was Emily Yorlings day and most of the
shoppers made their way to her drawingroom To go direct from a
shopping expedition to a tea party was what was known locally as living
in a whirl

Two extra assistants had been engaged for the following afternoon and
their services were in brisk demand the shop was crowded People bought
and bought and never seemed to get to the end of their lists Mr
Scarrick had never had so little difficulty in persuading customers to
embark on new experiences in grocery wares Even those women whose
purchases were of modest proportions dawdled over them as though they had
brutal drunken husbands to go home to The afternoon had dragged
uneventfully on and there was a distinct buzz of unpent excitement when
a darkeyed boy carrying a brass bowl entered the shop The excitement
seemed to have communicated itself to Mr Scarrick abruptly deserting a
lady who was making insincere inquiries about the home life of the Bombay
duck he intercepted the newcomer on his way to the accustomed counter
and informed him amid a deathlike hush that he had run out of quail
seed

The boy looked nervously round the shop and turned hesitatingly to go
He was again intercepted this time by the nephew who darted out from
behind his counter and said something about a better line of oranges The
boys hesitation vanished he almost scuttled into the obscurity of the
orange corner There was an expectant turn of public attention towards
the door and the tall bearded stranger made a really effective
entrance The aunt of Mrs Greyes declared afterwards that she found
herself subconsciously repeating The Assyrian came down like a wolf on
the fold under her breath and she was generally believed

The newcomer too was stopped before he reached the counter but not by
Mr Scarrick or his assistant A heavily veiled lady whom no one had
hitherto noticed rose languidly from a seat and greeted him in a clear
penetrating voice

Your Excellency does his shopping himself she said

I order the things myself he explained I find it difficult to make
my servants understand

In a lower but still perfectly audible voice the veiled lady gave him a
piece of casual information

They have some excellent Jaffa oranges here Then with a tinkling
laugh she passed out of the shop

The man glared all round the shop and then fixing his eyes
instinctively on the barrier of biscuit tins demanded loudly of the
grocer You have perhaps some good Jaffa oranges

Every one expected an instant denial on the part of Mr Scarrick of any
such possession Before he could answer however the boy had broken
forth from his sanctuary Holding his empty brass bowl before him he
passed out into the street His face was variously described afterwards
as masked with studied indifference overspread with ghastly pallor and
blazing with defiance Some said that his teeth chattered others that
he went out whistling the Persian National Hymn There was no mistaking
however the effect produced by the encounter on the man who had seemed
to force it If a rabid dog or a rattlesnake had suddenly thrust its
companionship on him he could scarcely have displayed a greater access of
terror His air of authority and assertiveness had gone his masterful
stride had given way to a furtive pacing to and fro as of an animal
seeking an outlet for escape In a dazed perfunctory manner always with
his eyes turning to watch the shop entrance he gave a few random orders
which the grocer made a show of entering in his book Now and then he
walked out into the street looked anxiously in all directions and
hurried back to keep up his pretence of shopping From one of these
sorties he did not return he had dashed away into the dusk and neither
he nor the darkfaced boy nor the veiled lady were seen again by the
expectant crowds that continued to throng the Scarrick establishment for
days to come

    

I can never thank you and your sister sufficiently said the grocer

We enjoyed the fun of it said the artist modestly and as for the
model it was a welcome variation on posing for hours for The Lost
Hylas

At any rate said the grocer I insist on paying for the hire of the
black beard




CANOSSA


Demosthenes Platterbaff the eminent Unrest Inducer stood on his trial
for a serious offence and the eyes of the political world were focussed
on the jury The offence it should be stated was serious for the
Government rather than for the prisoner He had blown up the Albert Hall
on the eve of the great Liberal Federation Tango Tea the occasion on
which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was expected to propound his new
theory Do partridges spread infectious diseases Platterbaff had
chosen his time well the Tango Tea had been hurriedly postponed but
there were other political fixtures which could not be put off under any
circumstances The day after the trial there was to be a byelection at
NemesisonHand and it had been openly announced in the division that if
Platterbaff were languishing in gaol on polling day the Government
candidate would be outed to a certainty Unfortunately there could be
no doubt or misconception as to Platterbaffs guilt He had not only
pleaded guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapade
in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the
trial he was busy examining a small model of the Free Trade Hall in
Manchester The jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not
deliberately and intentionally blown up the Albert Hall the question
was Could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit of
an acquittal Of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled
to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon but it was highly
desirable from the Governments point of view that the necessity for
such an exercise of clemency should not arise A headlong pardon on the
eve of a byeelection with threats of a heavy voting defection if it
were withheld or even delayed would not necessarily be a surrender but
it would look like one Opponents would be only too ready to attribute
ungenerous motives Hence the anxiety in the crowded Court and in the
little groups gathered round the tapemachines in Whitehall and Downing
Street and other affected centres

The jury returned from considering their verdict there was a flutter an
excited murmur a deathlike hush The foreman delivered his message

The jury find the prisoner guilty of blowing up the Albert Hall The
jury wish to add a rider drawing attention to the fact that a byelection
is pending in the Parliamentary division of NemesisonHand

That of course said the Government Prosecutor springing to his feet
is equivalent to an acquittal

I hardly think so said the Judge coldly I feel obliged to sentence
the prisoner to a weeks imprisonment

And may the Lord have mercy on the poll a Junior Counsel exclaimed
irreverently

It was a scandalous sentence but then the Judge was not on the
Ministerial side in politics

The verdict and sentence were made known to the public at twenty minutes
past five in the afternoon at halfpast five a dense crowd was massed
outside the Prime Ministers residence lustily singing to the air of
Trelawney

 And should our Hero rot in gaol
 For een a single day
 Theres Fifteen Hundred Voting Men
 Will vote the other way

Fifteen hundred said the Prime Minister with a shudder its too
horrible to think of Our majority last time was only a thousand and
seven

The poll opens at eight tomorrow morning said the Chief Organiser
we must have him out by 7 am

Seventhirty amended the Prime Minister we must avoid any appearance
of precipitancy

Not later than seventhirty then said the Chief Organiser I have
promised the agent down there that he shall be able to display posters
announcing Platterbaff is Out before the poll opens He said it was
our only chance of getting a telegram Radprop is In tonight

At halfpast seven the next morning the Prime Minister and the Chief
Organiser sat at breakfast making a perfunctory meal and awaiting the
return of the Home Secretary who had gone in person to superintend the
releasing of Platterbaff Despite the earliness of the hour a small
crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing
Trelawney refrain of the Fifteen Hundred Voting Men came in a steady
monotonous chant

They will cheer presently when they hear the news said the Prime
Minister hopefully hark They are booing some one now That must be
McKenna

The Home Secretary entered the room a moment later disaster written on
his face

He wont go he exclaimed

Wont go Wont leave gaol

He wont go unless he has a brass band He says he never has left
prison without a brass band to play him out and hes not going to go
without one now

But surely that sort of thing is provided by his supporters and
admirers said the Prime Minister we can hardly be supposed to supply
a released prisoner with a brass band How on earth could we defend it
on the Estimates

His supporters say it is up to us to provide the music said the Home
Secretary they say we put him in prison and its our affair to see
that he leaves it in a respectable manner Anyway he wont go unless he
has a band

The telephone squealed shrilly it was a trunk call from Nemesis

Poll opens in five minutes Is Platterbaff out yet In Heavens name
why

The Chief Organiser rang off

This is not a moment for standing on dignity he observed bluntly
musicians must be supplied at once Platterbaff must have his band

Where are you going to find the musicians asked the Home Secretary
wearily we cant employ a military band in fact I dont think hed
have one if we offered it and there aint any others Theres a
musicians strike on I suppose you know

Cant you get a strike permit asked the Organiser

Ill try said the Home Secretary and went to the telephone

Eight oclock struck The crowd outside chanted with an increasing
volume of sound

 Will vote the other way

A telegram was brought in It was from the central committee rooms at
Nemesis Losing twenty votes per minute was its brief message

Ten oclock struck The Prime Minister the Home Secretary the Chief
Organiser and several earnest helpful friends were gathered in the inner
gateway of the prison talking volubly to Demosthenes Platterbaff who
stood with folded arms and squarely planted feet silent in their midst
Goldentongued legislators whose eloquence had swayed the Marconi Inquiry
Committee or at any rate the greater part of it expended their arts of
oratory in vain on this stubborn unyielding man Without a band he would
not go and they had no band

A quarter past ten halfpast A constant stream of telegraph boys
poured in through the prison gates

Yamleys factory hands just voted you can guess how ran a despairing
message and the others were all of the same tenour Nemesis was going
the way of Reading

Have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play demanded the
Chief Organiser of the Prison Governor drums cymbals those sort of
things

The warders have a private band of their own said the Governor but
of course I couldnt allow the men themselves

Lend us the instruments said the Chief Organiser

One of the earnest helpful friends was a skilled performer on the cornet
the Cabinet Ministers were able to clash cymbals more or less in tune
and the Chief Organiser has some knowledge of the drum

What tune would you prefer he asked Platterbaff

The popular song of the moment replied the Agitator after a moments
reflection

It was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no
difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it To the improvised
strains of I didnt want to do it the prisoner strode forth to freedom
The word of the song had reference it was understood to the
incarcerating Government and not to the destroyer of the Albert Hall

The seat was lost after all by a narrow majority The local Trade
Unionists took offence at the fact of Cabinet Ministers having personally
acted as strikebreakers and even the release of Platterbaff failed to
pacify them

The seat was lost but Ministers had scored a moral victory They had
shown that they knew when and how to yield




THE THREAT


Sir Lulworth Quayne sat in the lounge of his favourite restaurant the
Gallus Bankiva discussing the weaknesses of the world with his nephew
who had lately returned from a muchenlivened exile in the wilds of
Mexico It was that blessed season of the year when the asparagus and
the plovers egg are abroad in the land and the oyster has not yet
withdrawn into its summer entrenchments and Sir Lulworth and his nephew
were in that enlightened afterdinner mood when politics are seen in
their right perspective even the politics of Mexico

Most of the revolutions that take place in this country nowadays said
Sir Lulworth are the product of moments of legislative panic Take
for instance one of the most dramatic reforms that has been carried
through Parliament in the lifetime of this generation It happened
shortly after the coal strike of unblessed memory To you who have
been plunged up to the neck in events of a more tangled and tumbled
description the things I am going to tell you of may seem of secondary
interest but after all we had to live in the midst of them

Sir Lulworth interrupted himself for a moment to say a few kind words to
the liqueur brandy he had just tasted and them resumed his narrative

Whether one sympathises with the agitation for female suffrage or not
one has to admit that its promoters showed tireless energy and
considerable enterprise in devising and putting into action new methods
for accomplishing their ends As a rule they were a nuisance and a
weariness to the flesh but there were times when they verged on the
picturesque There was the famous occasion when they enlivened and
diversified the customary pageantry of the Royal progress to open
Parliament by letting loose thousands of parrots which had been
carefully trained to scream Votes for women and which circled round
his Majestys coach in a clamorous cloud of green and grey and scarlet
It was really rather a striking episode from the spectacular point of
view unfortunately however for its devisers the secret of their
intentions had not been well kept and their opponents let loose at the
same moment a rival swarm of parrots which screeched I _dont_ think
and other hostile cries thereby robbing the demonstration of the
unanimity which alone could have made it politically impressive In the
process of recapture the birds learned a quantity of additional language
which unfitted them for further service in the Suffragette cause some of
the green ones were secured by ardent Home Rule propagandists and trained
to disturb the serenity of Orange meetings by pessimistic reflections on
Sir Edward Carsons destination in the life to come In fact the bird
in politics is a factor that seems to have come to stay quite recently
at a political gathering held in a dimlylighted place of worship the
congregation gave a respectful hearing for nearly ten minutes to a
jackdaw from Wapping under the impression that they were listening to
the Chancellor of the Exchequer who was late in arriving

But the Suffragettes interrupted the nephew what did they do next

After the bird fiasco said Sir Lulworth the militant section made a
demonstration of a more aggressive nature they assembled in force on the
opening day of the Royal Academy Exhibition and destroyed some three or
four hundred of the pictures This proved an even worse failure than the
parrot business every one agreed that there was always far too many
pictures in the Academy Exhibition and the drastic weeding out of a few
hundred canvases was regarded as a positive improvement Moreover from
the artists point of view it was realised that the outrage constituted a
sort of compensation for those whose works were persistently skied
since out of sight meant also out of reach Altogether it was one of the
most successful and popular exhibitions that the Academy had held for
many years Then the fair agitators fell back on some of their earlier
methods they wrote sweetly argumentative plays to prove that they ought
to have the vote they smashed windows to show that they must have the
vote and they kicked Cabinet Ministers to demonstrate that theyd better
have the vote and still the coldly reasoned or unreasoned reply was that
theyd better not Their plight might have been summed up in a
perversion of Gilberts lines

 Twenty voteless millions we
 Voteless all against our will
 Twenty years hence we shall be
 Twenty voteless millions still

And of course the great idea for their masterstroke of strategy came
from a masculine source Lena Dubarri who was the captaingeneral of
their thinking department met Waldo Orpington in the Mall one afternoon
just at a time when the fortunes of the Cause were at their lowest ebb
Waldo Orpington is a frivolous little fool who chirrups at drawingroom
concerts and can recognise bits from different composers without
referring to the programme but all the same he occasionally has ideas
He didnt care a twopenny fiddlestring about the Cause but he rather
enjoyed the idea of having his finger in the political pie Also it is
possible though I should think highly improbable that he admired Lena
Dubarri Anyhow when Lena gave a rather gloomy account of the existing
state of things in the Suffragette World Waldo was not merely
sympathetic but ready with a practical suggestion Turning his gaze
westward along the Mall towards the setting sun and Buckingham Palace
he was silent for a moment and then said significantly You have
expended your energies and enterprise on labours of destruction why has
it never occurred to you to attempt something far more terrific

What do you mean she asked him eagerly

Create

Do you mean create disturbances Weve been doing nothing else for
months she said

Waldo shook his head and continued to look westward along the Mall
Hes rather good at acting in an amateur sort of fashion Lena followed
his gaze and then turned to him with a puzzled look of inquiry

Exactly said Waldo in answer to her look

Buthow can we create she asked its been done already

Do it _again_ said Waldo and again and again

Before he could finish the sentence she had kissed him She declared
afterwards that he was the first man she had ever kissed and he declared
that she was the first woman who had ever kissed him in the Mall so they
both secured a record of a kind

Within the next day or two a new departure was noticeable in Suffragette
tactics They gave up worrying Ministers and Parliament and took to
worrying their own sympathisers and supportersfor funds The ballot
box was temporarily forgotten in the cult of the collectingbox The
daughters of the horseleech were not more persistent in their demands
the financiers of the tottering _ancien regime_ were not more desperate
in their expedients for raising money than the Suffragist workers of all
sections at this juncture and in one way and another by fair means and
normal they really got together a very useful sum What they were going
to do with it no one seemed to know not even those who were most active
in collecting work The secret on this occasion had been well kept
Certain transactions that leaked out from time to time only added to the
mystery of the situation

Dont you long to know what we are going to do with our treasure
hoard Lena asked the Prime Minister one day when she happened to sit
next to him at a whist drive at the Chinese Embassy

I was hoping you were going to try a little personal bribery he
responded banteringly but some genuine anxiety and curiosity lay behind
the lightness of his chaff of course I know he added that you have
been buying up building sites in commanding situations in and around the
Metropolis Two or three Im told are on the road to Brighton and
another near Ascot You dont mean to fortify them do you

Something more insidious than that she said you could prevent us
from building forts you cant prevent us from erecting an exact replica
of the Victoria Memorial on each of those sites Theyre all private
property with no building restrictions attached

Which memorial he asked not the one in front of Buckingham Palace
Surely not that one

That one she said

My dear lady he cried you cant be serious It is a beautiful and
imposing work of artat any rate one is getting accustomed to it and
even if one doesnt happen to admire it one can always look in another
direction But imagine what life would be like if one saw that erection
confronting one wherever one went Imagine the effect on people with
tired harassed nerves who saw it three times on the way to Brighton and
three times on the way back Imagine seeing it dominate the landscape at
Ascot and trying to keep your eye off it on the Sandwich golf links
What have your countrymen done to deserve such a thing

They have refused us the vote said Lena bitterly

The Prime Minister always declared himself an opponent of anything
savouring of panic legislation but he brought a Bill into Parliament
forthwith and successfully appealed to both Houses to pass it through all
its stages within the week And that is how we got one of the most
glorious measures of the century

A measure conferring the vote on women asked the nephew

Oh dear no An Act which made it a penal offence to erect
commemorative statuary anywhere within three miles of a public highway




EXCEPTING MRS PENTHERBY


It was Reggie Bruttles own idea for converting what had threatened to be
an albino elephant into a beast of burden that should help him along the
stony road of his finances The Limes which had come to him by
inheritance without any accompanying provision for its upkeep was one of
those pretentious unaccommodating mansions which none but a man of
wealth could afford to live in and which not one wealthy man in a
hundred would choose on its merits It might easily languish in the
estate market for years set round with noticeboards proclaiming it in
the eyes of a sceptical world to be an eminently desirable residence

Reggies scheme was to turn it into the headquarters of a prolonged
countryhouse party in session during the months from October till the
end of Marcha party consisting of young or youngish people of both
sexes too poor to be able to do much hunting or shooting on a serious
scale but keen on getting their fill of golf bridge dancing and
occasional theatregoing No one was to be on the footing of a paying
guest but every one was to rank as a paying host a committee would look
after the catering and expenditure and an informal subcommittee would
make itself useful in helping forward the amusement side of the scheme

As it was only an experiment there was to be a general agreement on the
part of those involved in it to be as lenient and mutually helpful to one
another as possible Already a promising nucleus including one or two
young married couples had been got together and the thing seemed to be
fairly launched

With good management and a little unobtrusive hard work I think the
thing ought to be a success said Reggie and Reggie was one of those
people who are painstaking first and optimistic afterwards

There is one rock on which you will unfailingly come to grief manage
you never so wisely said Major Dagberry cheerfully the women will
quarrel Mind you continued this prophet of disaster I dont say
that some of the men wont quarrel too probably they will but the women
are bound to You cant prevent it its in the nature of the sex The
hand that rocks the cradle rocks the world in a volcanic sense A woman
will endure discomforts and make sacrifices and go without things to an
heroic extent but the one luxury she will not go without is her
quarrels No matter where she may be or how transient her appearance on
a scene she will instal her feminine feuds as assuredly as a Frenchman
would concoct soup in the waste of the Arctic regions At the
commencement of a sea voyage before the male traveller knows half a
dozen of his fellow passengers by sight the average woman will have
started a couple of enmities and laid in material for one or two
moreprovided of course that there are sufficient women aboard to
permit quarrelling in the plural If theres no one else she will
quarrel with the stewardess This experiment of yours is to run for six
months in less than five weeks there will be war to the knife declaring
itself in half a dozen different directions

Oh come there are only eight women in the party they wont pick
quarrels quite so soon as that protested Reggie

They wont all originate quarrels perhaps conceded the Major but
they will all take sides and just as Christmas is upon you with its
conventions of peace and good will you will find yourself in for a
glacial epoch of cold unforgiving hostility with an occasional Etna
flare of open warfare You cant help it old boy but at any rate you
cant say you were not warned

The first five weeks of the venture falsified Major Dagberrys prediction
and justified Reggies optimism There were of course occasional small
bickerings and the existence of certain jealousies might be detected
below the surface of everyday intercourse but on the whole the women
folk got on remarkably well together There was however a notable
exception It had not taken five weeks for Mrs Pentherby to get herself
cordially disliked by the members of her own sex five days had been
amply sufficient Most of the women declared that they had detested her
the moment they set eyes on her but that was probably an afterthought

With the menfolk she got on well enough without being of the type of
woman who can only bask in male society neither was she lacking in the
general qualities which make an individual useful and desirable as a
member of a cooperative community She did not try to get the better
of her fellowhosts by snatching little advantages or cleverly evading
her just contributions she was not inclined to be boring or snobbish in
the way of personal reminiscence She played a fair game of bridge and
her cardroom manners were irreproachable But wherever she came in
contact with her own sex the light of battle kindled at once her talent
of arousing animosity seemed to border on positive genius

Whether the object of her attentions was thickskinned or sensitive
quicktempered or goodnatured Mrs Pentherby managed to achieve the
same effect She exposed little weaknesses she prodded sore places she
snubbed enthusiasms she was generally right in a matter of argument or
if wrong she somehow contrived to make her adversary appear foolish and
opinionated She did and said horrible things in a matteroffact
innocent way and she did and said matteroffact innocent things in a
horrible way In short the unanimous feminine verdict on her was that
she was objectionable

There was no question of taking sides as the Major had anticipated in
fact dislike of Mrs Pentherby was almost a bond of union between the
other women and more than one threatening disagreement had been rapidly
dissipated by her obvious and malicious attempts to inflame and extend
it and the most irritating thing about her was her successful assumption
of unruffled composure at moments when the tempers of her adversaries
were with difficulty kept under control She made her most scathing
remarks in the tone of a tube conductor announcing that the next station
is Brompton Roadthe measured listless tone of one who knows he is
right but is utterly indifferent to the fact that he proclaims

On one occasion Mrs Val Gwepton who was not blessed with the most
reposeful of temperaments fairly let herself go and gave Mrs Pentherby
a vivid and truthful _resume_ of her opinion of her The object of this
unpent storm of accumulated animosity waited patiently for a lull and
then remarked quietly to the angry little woman

And now my dear Mrs Gwepton let me tell you something that Ive been
wanting to say for the last two or three minutes only you wouldnt given
me a chance youve got a hairpin dropping out on the left side You
thinhaired women always find it difficult to keep your hairpins in

What can one do with a woman like that Mrs Val demanded afterwards of
a sympathising audience

Of course Reggie received numerous hints as to the unpopularity of this
jarring personality His sisterinlaw openly tackled him on the subject
of her many enormities Reggie listened with the attenuated regret that
one bestows on an earthquake disaster in Bolivia or a crop failure in
Eastern Turkestan events which seem so distant that one can almost
persuade oneself they havent happened

That woman has got some hold over him opined his sisterinlaw
darkly either she is helping him to finance the show and presumes on
the fact or else which Heaven forbid hes got some queer infatuation
for her Men do take the most extraordinary fancies

Matters never came exactly to a crisis Mrs Pentherby as a source of
personal offence spread herself over so wide an area that no one woman
of the party felt impelled to rise up and declare that she absolutely
refused to stay another week in the same house with her What is
everybodys tragedy is nobodys tragedy There was ever a certain
consolation in comparing notes as to specific acts of offence Reggies
sisterinlaw had the added interest of trying to discover the secret
bond which blunted his condemnation of Mrs Pentherbys long catalogue of
misdeeds There was little to go on from his manner towards her in
public but he remained obstinately unimpressed by anything that was said
against her in private

With the one exception of Mrs Pentherbys unpopularity the houseparty
scheme was a success on its first trial and there was no difficulty
about reconstructing it on the same lines for another winter session It
so happened that most of the women of the party and two or three of the
men would not be available on this occasion but Reggie had laid his
plans well ahead and booked plenty of fresh blood for the departure It
would be if any thing rather a larger party than before

Im so sorry I cant join this winter said Reggies sisterinlaw
but we must go to our cousins in Ireland weve put them off so often
What a shame Youll have none of the same women this time

Excepting Mrs Pentherby said Reggie demurely

Mrs Pentherby _Surely_ Reggie youre not going to be so idiotic as
to have that woman again Shell set all the womens backs up just as
she did this time What _is_ this mysterious hold shes go over you

Shes invaluable said Reggie shes my official quarreller

Yourwhat did you say gasped his sisterinlaw

I introduced her into the houseparty for the express purpose of
concentrating the feuds and quarrelling that would otherwise have broken
out in all directions among the womenkind I didnt need the advice and
warning of sundry friends to foresee that we shouldnt get through six
months of close companionship without a certain amount of pecking and
sparring so I thought the best thing was to localise and sterilise it in
one process Of course I made it well worth the ladys while and as
she didnt know any of you from Adam and you dont even know her real
name she didnt mind getting herself disliked in a useful cause

You mean to say she was in the know all the time

Of course she was and so were one or two of the men so she was able to
have a good laugh with us behind the scenes when shed done anything
particularly outrageous And she really enjoyed herself You see shes
in the position of poor relation in a rather pugnacious family and her
life has been largely spent in smoothing over other peoples quarrels
You can imagine the welcome relief of being able to go about saying and
doing perfectly exasperating things to a whole houseful of womenand all
in the cause of peace

I think you are the most odious person in the whole world said
Reggies sisterinlaw Which was not strictly true more than anybody
more than ever she disliked Mrs Pentherby It was impossible to
calculate how many quarrels that woman had done her out of




MARK


Augustus Mellowkent was a novelist with a future that is to say a
limited but increasing number of people read his books and there seemed
good reason to suppose that if he steadily continued to turn out novels
year by year a progressively increasing circle of readers would acquire
the Mellowkent habit and demand his works from the libraries and
bookstalls At the instigation of his publisher he had discarded the
baptismal Augustus and taken the front name of Mark

Women like a name that suggests some one strong and silent able but
unwilling to answer questions Augustus merely suggests idle splendour
but such a name as Mark Mellowkent besides being alliterative conjures
up a vision of some one strong and beautiful and good a sort of blend of
Georges Carpentier and the Reverend Whatshisname

One morning in December Augustus sat in his writingroom at work on the
third chapter of his eighth novel He had described at some length for
the benefit of those who could not imagine it what a rectory garden
looks like in July he was now engaged in describing at greater length
the feelings of a young girl daughter of a long line of rectors and
archdeacons when she discovers for the first time that the postman is
attractive

Their eyes met for a brief moment as he handed her two circulars and
the fat wrapperbound bulk of the _East Essex News_ Their eyes met for
the merest fraction of a second yet nothing could ever be quite the same
again Cost what it might she felt that she must speak must break the
intolerable unreal silence that had fallen on them How is your
mothers rheumatism she said

The authors labours were cut short by the sudden intrusion of a
maidservant

A gentleman to see you sir said the maid handing a card with the
name Caiaphas Dwelf inscribed on it says its important

Mellowkent hesitated and yielded the importance of the visitors mission
was probably illusory but he had never met any one with the name
Caiaphas before It would be at least a new experience

Mr Dwelf was a man of indefinite age his high narrow forehead cold
grey eyes and determined manner bespoke an unflinching purpose He had
a large book under his arm and there seemed every probability that he
had left a package of similar volumes in the hall He took a seat before
it had been offered him placed the book on the table and began to
address Mellowkent in the manner of an open letter

You are a literary man the author of several wellknown books

I am engage on a book at the present momentrather busily engaged
said Mellowkent pointedly

Exactly said the intruder time with you is a commodity of
considerable importance Minutes even have their value

They have agreed Mellowkent looking at his watch

That said Caiaphas is why this book that I am introducing to your
notice is not a book that you can afford to be without _Right Here_ is
indispensable for the writing man it is no ordinary encyclopaedia or I
should not trouble to show it to you It is an inexhaustible mine of
concise information

On a shelf at my elbow said the author I have a row of reference
books that supply me with all the information I am likely to require

Here persisted the wouldbe salesman you have it all in one compact
volume No matter what the subject may be which you wish to look up or
the fact you desire to verify _Right Here_ gives you all that you want
to know in the briefest and most enlightening form Historical
reference for instance career of John Huss let us say Here we are
Huss John celebrated religious reformer Born 1369 burned at
Constance 1415 The Emperor Sigismund universally blamed

If he had been burnt in these days every one would have suspected the
Suffragettes observed Mellowkent

Poultrykeeping now resumed Caiaphas thats a subject that might
crop up in a novel dealing with English country life Here we have all
about it The Leghorn as eggproducer Lack of maternal instinct in the
Minorca Gapes in chickens its cause and cure Ducklings for the early
market how fattened There you see there it all is nothing
lacking

Except the maternal instinct in the Minorca and that you could hardly
be expected to supply

Sporting records thats important too now how many men sporting men
even are there who can say offhand what horse won the Derby in any
particular year Now its just a little thing of that sort

My dear sir interrupted Mellowkent there are at least four men in my
club who can not only tell me what horse won in any given year but what
horse ought to have won and why it didnt If your book could supply a
method for protecting one from information of that sort it would do more
than anything you have yet claimed for it

Geography said Caiaphas imperturbably thats a thing that a busy
man writing at high pressure may easily make a slip over Only the
other day a wellknown author made the Volga flow into the Black Sea
instead of the Caspian now with this book

On a polished rosewood stand behind you there reposes a reliable and up
todate atlas said Mellowkent and now I must really ask you to be
going

An atlas said Caiaphas gives merely the chart of the rivers course
and indicates the principal towns that it passes Now _Right Here_ gives
you the scenery traffic ferryboat charges the prevalent types of
fish boatmens slang terms and hours of sailing of the principal river
steamers If gives you

Mellowkent sat and watched the hardfeatured resolute pitiless
salesman as he sat doggedly in the chair wherein he had installed
himself unflinchingly extolling the merits of his undesired wares A
spirit of wistful emulation took possession of the author why could he
not live up to the cold stern name he had adopted Why must he sit here
weakly and listen to this weary unconvincing tirade why could he not be
Mark Mellowkent for a few brief moments and meet this man on level
terms

A sudden inspiration flashed across his

Have you read my last book _The Cageless Linnet_ he asked

I dont read novels said Caiaphas tersely

Oh but you ought to read this one every one ought to exclaimed
Mellowkent fishing the book down from a shelf published at six
shillings you can have it at fourandsix There is a bit in chapter
five that I feel sure you would like where Emma is alone in the birch
copse waiting for Harold Huntingdonthat is the man her family want her
to marry She really wants to marry him too but she does not discover
that till chapter fifteen Listen Far as the eye could stretch rolled
the mauve and purple billows of heather lit up here and there with the
glowing yellow of gorse and broom and edged round with the delicate
greys and silver and green of the young birch trees Tiny blue and brown
butterflies fluttered above the fronds of heather revelling in the
sunlight and overhead the larks were singing as only larks can sing It
was a day when all Nature

In _Right Here_ you have full information on all branches of Nature
study broke in the bookagent with a tired note sounding in his voice
for the first time forestry insect life bird migration reclamation
of waste lands As I was saying no man who has to deal with the varied
interests of life

I wonder if you would care for one of my earlier books _The Reluctance
of Lady Cullumpton_ said Mellowkent hunting again through the
bookshelf some people consider it my best novel Ah here it is I
see there are one or two spots on the cover so I wont ask more than
threeandninepence for it Do let me read you how it opens

Beatrice Lady Cullumpton entered the long dimlylit drawingroom her
eyes blazing with a hope that she guessed to be groundless her lips
trembling with a fear that she could not disguise In her hand she
carried a small fan a fragile toy of lace and satinwood Something
snapped as she entered the room she had crushed the fan into a dozen
pieces

There what do you think of that for an opening It tells you at once
that theres something afoot

I dont read novels said Caiaphas sullenly

But just think what a resource they are exclaimed the author on long
winter evenings or perhaps when you are laid up with a strained anklea
thing that might happen to any one or if you were staying in a house
party with persistent wet weather and a stupid hostess and insufferably
dull fellowguests you would just make an excuse that you had letters to
write go to your room light a cigarette and for threeandninepence
you could plunge into the society of Beatrice Lady Cullumpton and her
set No one ought to travel without one or two of my novels in their
luggage as a standby A friend of mine said only the other day that he
would as soon think of going into the tropics without quinine as of going
on a visit without a couple of Mark Mellowkents in his kitbag Perhaps
sensation is more in your line I wonder if Ive got a copy of _The
Pythons Kiss_

Caiaphas did not wait to be tempted with selections from that thrilling
work of fiction With a muttered remark about having no time to waste on
monkeytalk he gathered up his slighted volume and departed He made no
audible reply to Mellowkents cheerful Good morning but the latter
fancied that a look of respectful hatred flickered in the cold grey eyes




THE HEDGEHOG


A Mixed Double of young people were contesting a game of lawn tennis at
the Rectory garden party for the past fiveandtwenty years at least
mixed doubles of young people had done exactly the same thing on exactly
the same spot at about the same time of year The young people changed
and made way for others in the course of time but very little else
seemed to alter The present players were sufficiently conscious of the
social nature of the occasion to be concerned about their clothes and
appearance and sufficiently sportloving to be keen on the game Both
their efforts and their appearance came under the fourfold scrutiny of a
quartet of ladies sitting as official spectators on a bench immediately
commanding the court It was one of the accepted conditions of the
Rectory garden party that four ladies who usually knew very little about
tennis and a great deal about the players should sit at that particular
spot and watch the game It had also come to be almost a tradition that
two ladies should be amiable and that the other two should be Mrs Dole
and Mrs HatchMallard

What a singularly unbecoming way Eva Jonelet has taken to doing her hair
in said Mrs HatchMallard its ugly hair at the best of times but
she neednt make it look ridiculous as well Some one ought to tell
her

Eva Jonelets hair might have escaped Mrs HatchMallards condemnation
if she could have forgotten the more glaring fact that Eva was Mrs
Doles favourite niece It would perhaps have been a more comfortable
arrangement if Mrs HatchMallard and Mrs Dole could have been asked to
the Rectory on separate occasions but there was only one garden party in
the course of the year and neither lady could have been omitted from the
list of invitations without hopelessly wrecking the social peace of the
parish

How pretty the yew trees look at this time of year interposed a lady
with a soft silvery voice that suggested a chinchilla muff painted by
Whistler

What do you mean by this time of year demanded Mrs HatchMallard
Yew trees look beautiful at all times of the year That is their great
charm

Yew trees never look anything but hideous under any circumstances or at
any time of year said Mrs Dole with the slow emphatic relish of one
who contradicts for the pleasure of the thing They are only fit for
graveyards and cemeteries

Mrs HatchMallard gave a sardonic snort which being translated meant
that there were some people who were better fitted for cemeteries than
for garden parties

What is the score please asked the lady with the chinchilla voice

The desired information was given her by a young gentleman in spotless
white flannels whose general toilet effect suggested solicitude rather
than anxiety

What an odious young cub Bertie Dykson has become pronounced Mrs
Dole remembering suddenly that Bertie was a favourite with Mrs Hatch
Mallard The young men of today are not what they used to be twenty
years ago

Of course not said Mrs HatchMallard twenty years ago Bertie Dykson
was just two years old and you must expect some difference in appearance
and manner and conversation between those two periods

Do you know said Mrs Dole confidentially I shouldnt be surprised
if that was intended to be clever

Have you any one interesting coming to stay with you Mrs Norbury
asked the chinchilla voice hastily you generally have a house party at
this time of year

Ive got a most interesting woman coming said Mrs Norbury who had
been mutely struggling for some chance to turn the conversation into a
safe channel an old acquaintance of mine Ada Bleek

What an ugly name said Mrs HatchMallard

Shes descended from the de la Bliques an old Huguenot family of
Touraine you know

There werent any Huguenots in Touraine said Mrs HatchMallard who
thought she might safely dispute any fact that was three hundred years
old

Well anyhow shes coming to stay with me continued Mrs Norbury
bringing her story quickly down to the present day she arrives this
evening and shes highly clairvoyante a seventh daughter of a seventh
daughter you now and all that sort of thing

How very interesting said the chinchilla voice Exwood is just the
right place for her to come to isnt it There are supposed to be
several ghosts there

That is why she was so anxious to come said Mrs Norbury she put off
another engagement in order to accept my invitation Shes had visions
and dreams and all those sort of things that have come true in a most
marvellous manner but shes never actually seen a ghost and shes
longing to have that experience She belongs to that Research Society
you know

I expect shell see the unhappy Lady Cullumpton the most famous of all
the Exwood ghosts said Mrs Dole my ancestor you know Sir Gervase
Cullumpton murdered his young bride in a fit of jealousy while they were
on a visit to Exwood He strangled her in the stables with a stirrup
leather just after they had come in from riding and she is seen
sometimes at dusk going about the lawns and the stable yard in a long
green habit moaning and trying to get the thong from round her throat I
shall be most interested to hear if your friend sees

I dont know why she should be expected to see a trashy traditional
apparition like the socalled Cullumpton ghost that is only vouched for
by housemaids and tipsy stableboys when my uncle who was the owner of
Exwood committed suicide there under the most tragical circumstances
and most certainly haunts the place

Mrs HatchMallard has evidently never read _Popples County History_
said Mrs Dole icily or she would know that the Cullumpton ghost has a
wealth of evidence behind it

Oh Popple exclaimed Mrs HatchMallard scornfully any rubbishy old
story is good enough for him Popple indeed Now my uncles ghost was
seen by a Rural Dean who was also a Justice of the Peace I should
think that would be good enough testimony for any one Mrs Norbury I
shall take it as a deliberate personal affront if your clairvoyante
friend sees any other ghost except that of my uncle

I daresay she wont see anything at all she never has yet you know
said Mrs Norbury hopefully

It was a most unfortunate topic for me to have broached she lamented
afterwards to the owner of the chinchilla voice Exwood belongs to Mrs
HatchMallard and weve only got it on a short lease A nephew of hers
has been wanting to live there for some time and if we offend her in any
way shell refuse to renew the lease I sometimes think these garden
parties are a mistake

The Norburys played bridge for the next three nights till nearly one
oclock they did not care for the game but it reduced the time at their
guests disposal for undesirable ghostly visitations

Miss Bleek is not likely to be in a frame of mind to see ghosts said
Hugo Norbury if she goes to bed with her brain awhirl with royal spades
and no trumps and grand slams

Ive talked to her for hours about Mrs HatchMallards uncle said his
wife and pointed out the exact spot where he killed himself and
invented all sorts of impressive details and Ive found an old portrait
of Lord John Russell and put it in her room and told her that its
supposed to be a picture of the uncle in middle age If Ada does see a
ghost at all it certainly ought to be old HatchMallards At any rate
weve done our best

The precautions were in vain On the third morning of her stay Ada Bleek
came down late to breakfast her eyes looking very tired but ablaze with
excitement her hair done anyhow and a large brown volume hugged under
her arm

At last Ive seen something supernatural she exclaimed and gave Mrs
Norbury a fervent kiss as though in gratitude for the opportunity
afforded her

A ghost cried Mrs Norbury not really

Really and unmistakably

Was it an oldish man in the dress of about fifty years ago asked Mrs
Norbury hopefully

Nothing of the sort said Ada it was a white hedgehog

A white hedgehog exclaimed both the Norburys in tones of disconcerted
astonishment

A huge white hedgehog with baleful yellow eyes said Ada I was lying
half asleep in bed when suddenly I felt a sensation as of something
sinister and unaccountable passing through the room I sat up and looked
round and there under the window I saw an evil creeping thing a sort
of monstrous hedgehog of a dirty white colour with black loathsome
claws that clicked and scraped along the floor and narrow yellow eyes
of indescribable evil It slithered along for a yard or two always
looking at me with its cruel hideous eyes then when it reached the
second window which was open it clambered up the sill and vanished I
got up at once and went to the window there wasnt a sign of it
anywhere Of course I knew it must be something from another world but
it was not till I turned up Popples chapter on local traditions that I
realised what I had seen

She turned eagerly to the large brown volume and read Nicholas
Herison an old miser was hung at Batchford in 1763 for the murder of a
farm lad who had accidentally discovered his secret hoard His ghost is
supposed to traverse the countryside appearing sometimes as a white owl
sometimes as a huge white hedgehog

I expect you read the Popple story overnight and that made you _think_
you saw a hedgehog when you were only half awake said Mrs Norbury
hazarding a conjecture that probably came very near the truth

Ada scouted the possibility of such a solution of her apparition

This must be hushed up said Mrs Norbury quickly the servants

Hushed up exclaimed Ada indignantly Im writing a long report on it
for the Research Society

It was then that Hugo Norbury who is not naturally a man of brilliant
resource had one of the really useful inspirations of his life

It was very wicked of us Miss Bleek he said but it would be a shame
to let it go further That white hedgehog is an old joke of ours
stuffed albino hedgehog you know that my father brought home from
Jamaica where they grow to enormous size We hide it in the room with a
string on it run one end of the string through the window then we pull
if from below and it comes scraping along the floor just as youve
described and finally jerks out of the window Taken in heaps of
people they all read up Popple and think its old Harry Nicholsons
ghost we always stop them from writing to the papers about it though
That would be carrying matters too far

Mrs HatchMallard renewed the lease in due course but Ada Bleek has
never renewed her friendship




THE MAPPINED LIFE


These Mappin Terraces at the Zoological Gardens are a great improvement
on the old style of wildbeast cage said Mrs James Gurtleberry
putting down an illustrated paper they give one the illusion of seeing
the animals in their natural surroundings I wonder how much of the
illusion is passed on to the animals

That would depend on the animal said her niece a junglefowl for
instance would no doubt think its lawful jungle surroundings were
faithfully reproduced if you gave it a sufficiency of wives a goodly
variety of seed food and ants eggs a commodious bank of loose earth to
dust itself in a convenient roosting tree and a rival or two to make
matters interesting Of course there ought to be junglecats and birds
of prey and other agencies of sudden death to add to the illusion of
liberty but the birds own imagination is capable of inventing
thoselook how a domestic fowl will squawk an alarm note if a rook or
wood pigeon passes over its run when it has chickens

You think then they really do have a sort of illusion if you give
them space enough

In a few cases only Nothing will make me believe that an acre or so of
concrete enclosure will make up to a wolf or a tigercat for the range of
night prowling that would belong to it in a wild state Think of the
dictionary of sound and scent and recollection that unfolds before a real
wild beat as it comes out from its lair every evening with the knowledge
that in a few minutes it will be hieing along to some distant hunting
ground where all the joy and fury of the chase awaits it think of the
crowded sensations of the brain when every rustle every cry every bent
twig and every whiff across the nostrils means something something to
do with life and death and dinner Imagine the satisfaction of stealing
down to your own particular drinking spot choosing your own particular
tree to scrape your claws on finding your own particular bed of dried
grass to roll on Then in the place of all that put a concrete
promenade which will be of exactly the same dimensions whether you race
or crawl across it coated with stale unvarying scents and surrounded
with cries and noises that have ceased to have the least meaning or
interest As a substitute for a narrow cage the new enclosures are
excellent but I should think they are a poor imitation of a life of
liberty

Its rather depressing to think that said Mrs Gurtleberry they look
so spacious and so natural but I suppose a good deal of what seems
natural to us would be meaningless to a wild animal

That is where our superior powers of selfdeception come in said the
niece we are able to live our unreal stupid little lives on our
particular Mappin terrace and persuade ourselves that we really are
untrammelled men and women leading a reasonable existence in a reasonable
sphere

But good gracious exclaimed the aunt bouncing into an attitude of
scandalised defence we are leading reasonable existences What on
earth do you mean by trammels We are merely trammelled by the ordinary
decent conventions of civilised society

We are trammelled said the niece calmly and pitilessly by
restrictions of income and opportunity and above all by lack of
initiative To some people a restricted income doesnt matter a bit in
fact it often seems to help as a means for getting a lot of reality out
of life I am sure there are men and women who do their shopping in
little back streets of Paris buying four carrots and a shred of beef for
their daily sustenance who lead a perfectly real and eventful existence
Lack of initiative is the thing that really cripples one and that is
where you and I and Uncle James are so hopelessly shut in We are just
so many animals stuck down on a Mappin terrace with this difference in
our disfavour that the animals are there to be looked at while nobody
wants to look at us As a matter of fact there would be nothing to look
at We get colds in winter and hay fever in summer and if a wasp
happens to sting one of us well that is the wasps initiative not
ours all we do is to wait for the swelling to go down Whenever we do
climb into local fame and notice it is by indirect methods if it
happens to be a good flowering year for magnolias the neighbourhood
observes Have you seen the Gurtleberrys magnolia It is a perfect
mass of flowers and we go about telling people that there are fifty
seven blossoms as against thirtynine the previous year

In Coronation year there were as many as sixty put in the aunt your
uncle has kept a record for the last eight years

Doesnt it ever strike you continued the niece relentlessly that if
we moved away from here or were blotted out of existence our local claim
to fame would pass on automatically to whoever happened to take the house
and garden People would say to one another Have you seen the Smith
Jenkins magnolia It is a perfect mass of flowers or else
SmithJenkins tells me there wont be a single blossom on their magnolia
this year the east winds have turned all the buds black Now if when
we had gone people still associated our names with the magnolia tree no
matter who temporarily possessed it if they said Ah thats the tree
on which the Gurtleberrys hung their cook because she sent up the wrong
kind of sauce with the asparagus that would be something really due to
our own initiative apart from anything east winds or magnolia vitality
might have to say in the matter

We should never do such a thing said the aunt

The niece gave a reluctant sigh

I cant imagine it she admitted Of course she continued there
are heaps of ways of leading a real existence without committing
sensational deeds of violence Its the dreadful little everyday acts of
pretended importance that give the Mappin stamp to our life It would be
entertaining if it wasnt so pathetically tragic to hear Uncle James
fuss in here in the morning and announce I must just go down into the
town and find out what the men there are saying about Mexico Matters
are beginning to look serious there Then he patters away into the
town and talks in a highly serious voice to the tobacconist
incidentally buying an ounce of tobacco perhaps he meets one or two
others of the worlds thinkers and talks to them in a highly serious
voice then he patters back here and announces with increased importance
Ive just been talking to some men in the town about the condition of
affairs in Mexico They agree with the view that I have formed that
things there will have to get worse before they get better Of course
nobody in the town cared in the least little bit what his views about
Mexico were or whether he had any The tobacconist wasnt even fluttered
at his buying the ounce of tobacco he knows that he purchases the same
quantity of the same sort of tobacco every week Uncle James might just
as well have lain on his back in the garden and chattered to the lilac
tree about the habits of caterpillars

I really will not listen to such things about your uncle protested
Mrs James Gurtleberry angrily

My own case is just as bad and just as tragic said the niece
dispassionately nearly everything about me is conventional
makebelieve Im not a good dancer and no one could honestly call me
goodlooking but when I go to one of our dull little local dances Im
conventionally supposed to have a heavenly time to attract the ardent
homage of the local cavaliers and to go home with my head awhirl with
pleasurable recollections As a matter of fact Ive merely put in some
hours of indifferent dancing drunk some badlymade claret cup and
listened to an enormous amount of laborious light conversation A
moonlight henstealing raid with the merryeyed curate would be
infinitely more exciting imagine the pleasure of carrying off all those
white minorcas that the Chibfords are always bragging about When we had
disposed of them we could give the proceeds to a charity so there would
be nothing really wrong about it But nothing of that sort lies within
the Mappined limits of my life One of these days somebody dull and
decorous and undistinguished will make himself agreeable to me at a
tennis party as the saying is and all the dull old gossips of the
neighbourhood will begin to ask when we are to be engaged and at last we
shall be engaged and people will give us butterdishes and
blottingcases and framed pictures of young women feeding swans Hullo
Uncle are you going out

Im just going down to the town announced Mr James Gurtleberry with
an air of some importance I want to hear what people are saying about
Albania Affairs there are beginning to take on a very serious look
Its my opinion that we havent seen the worst of things yet

In this he was probably right but there was nothing in the immediate or
prospective condition of Albania to warrant Mrs Gurtleberry in bursting
into tears




FATE


Rex Dillot was nearly twentyfour almost goodlooking and quite
penniless His mother was supposed to make him some sort of an allowance
out of what her creditors allowed her and Rex occasionally strayed into
the ranks of those who earn fitful salaries as secretaries or companions
to people who are unable to cope unaided with their correspondence or
their leisure For a few months he had been assistant editor and
business manager of a paper devoted to fancy mice but the devotion had
been all on one side and the paper disappeared with a certain abruptness
from club readingrooms and other haunts where it had made a gratuitous
appearance Still Rex lived with some air of comfort and wellbeing as
one can live if one is born with a genius for that sort of thing and a
kindly Providence usually arranged that his weekend invitations
coincided with the dates on which his one white dinnerwaistcoat was in a
laundryreturned condition of dazzling cleanness He played most games
badly and was shrewd enough to recognise the fact but he had developed
a marvellously accurate judgement in estimating the play and chances of
other people whether in a golf match billiard handicap or croquet
tournament By dint of parading his opinion of such and such a players
superiority with a sufficient degree of youthful assertiveness he usually
succeeded in provoking a wager at liberal odds and he looked to his week
end winnings to carry him through the financial embarrassments of his mid
week existence The trouble was as he confided to Clovis Sangrail that
he never had enough available or even prospective cash at his command to
enable him to fix the wager at a figure really worth winning

Some day he said I shall come across a really safe thing a bet that
simply cant go astray and then I shall put it up for all Im worth or
rather for a good deal more than Im worth if you sold me up to the last
button

It would be awkward if it didnt happen to come off said Clovis

It would be more than awkward said Rex it would be a tragedy All
the same it would be extremely amusing to bring it off Fancy awaking
in the morning with about three hundred pounds standing to ones credit
I should go and clear out my hostesss pigeonloft before breakfast out
of sheer goodtemper

Your hostess of the moment mightnt have a pigeonloft said Clovis

I always choose hostesses that have said Rex a pigeonloft is
indicative of a careless extravagant genial disposition such as I like
to see around me People who strew corn broadcast for a lot of feathered
inanities that just sit about cooing and giving each other the glad eye
in a Louis Quatorze manner are pretty certain to do you well

Young Strinnit is coming down this afternoon said Clovis reflectively
I dare say you wont find it difficult to get him to back himself at
billiards He plays a pretty useful game but hes not quite as good as
he fancies he is

I know one member of the party who can walk round him said Rex softly
an alert look coming into his eyes that cadaverouslooking Major who
arrived last night Ive seen him play at St Moritz If I could get
Strinnit to lay odds on himself against the Major the money would be safe
in my pocket This looks like the good thing Ive been watching and
praying for

Dont be rash counselled Clovis Strinnit may play up to his self
imagined form once in a blue moon

I intend to be rash said Rex quietly and the look on his face
corroborated his words

Are you all going to flock to the billiardroom asked Teresa
Thundleford after dinner with an air of some disapproval and a good
deal of annoyance I cant see what particular amusement you find in
watching two men prodding little ivory balls about on a table

Oh well said her hostess its a way of passing the time you know

A very poor way to my mind said Mrs Thundleford now I was going to
have shown all of you the photographs I took in Venice last summer

You showed them to us last night said Mrs Cuvering hastily

Those were the ones I took in Florence These are quite a different
lot

Oh well some time tomorrow we can look at them You can leave them
down in the drawingroom and then every one can have a look

I should prefer to show them when you are all gathered together as I
have quite a lot of explanatory remarks to make about Venetian art and
architecture on the same lines as my remarks last night on the
Florentine galleries Also there are some verses of mine that I should
like to read you on the rebuilding of the Campanile But of course if
you all prefer to watch Major Latton and Mr Strinnit knocking balls
about on a table

They are both supposed to be firstrate players said the hostess

I have yet to learn that my verses and my art _causerie_ are of second
rate quality said Mrs Thundleford with acerbity However as you all
seem bent on watching a silly game theres no more to be said I shall
go upstairs and finish some writing Later on perhaps I will come down
and join you

To one at least of the onlookers the game was anything but silly It
was absorbing exciting exasperating nervestretching and finally it
grew to be tragic The Major with the St Moritz reputation was playing
a long way below his form young Strinnit was playing slightly above his
and had all the luck of the game as well From the very start the balls
seemed possessed by a demon of contrariness they trundled about
complacently for one player they would go nowhere for the other

A hundred and seventy seventyfour sang out the youth who was
marking In a game of two hundred and fifty up it was an enormous lead
to hold Clovis watched the flush of excitement die away from Dillots
face and a hard white look take its place

How much have you go on whispered Clovis The other whispered the sum
through dry shaking lips It was more than he or any one connected with
him could pay he had done what he had said he would do He had been
rash

Two hundred and six ninetyeight

Rex heard a clock strike ten somewhere in the hall then another
somewhere else and another and another the house seemed full of
striking clocks Then in the distance the stable clock chimed in In
another hour they would all be striking eleven and he would be listening
to them as a disgraced outcast unable to pay even in part the wager he
had challenged

Two hundred and eighteen a hundred and three The game was as good as
over Rex was as good as done for He longed desperately for the
ceiling to fall in for the house to catch fire for anything to happen
that would put an end to that horrible rolling to and fro of red and
white ivory that was jostling him nearer and nearer to his doom

Two hundred and twentyeight a hundred and seven

Rex opened his cigarettecase it was empty That at least gave him a
pretext to slip away from the room for the purpose of refilling it he
would spare himself the drawnout torture of watching that hopeless game
played out to the bitter end He backed away from the circle of absorbed
watchers and made his way up a short stairway to a long silent corridor
of bedrooms each with a guests name written in a little square on the
door In the hush that reigned in this part of the house he could still
hear the hateful clickclick of the balls if he waited for a few minutes
longer he would hear the little outbreak of clapping and buzz of
congratulation that would hail Strinnits victory On the alert tension
of his nerves there broke another sound the aggressive wrathinducing
breathing of one who sleeps in heavy afterdinner slumber The sound
came from a room just at his elbow the card on the door bore the
announcement Mrs Thundleford The door was just slightly ajar Rex
pushed it open an inch or two more and looked in The august Teresa had
fallen asleep over an illustrated guide to Florentine artgalleries at
her side somewhat dangerously near the edge of the table was a reading
lamp If Fate had been decently kind to him thought Rex bitterly that
lamp would have been knocked over by the sleeper and would have given
them something to think of besides billiard matches

There are occasions when one must take ones Fate in ones hands Rex
took the lamp in his

Two hundred and thirtyseven one hundred and fifteen Strinnit was at
the table and the balls lay in good position for him he had a choice of
two fairly easy shots a choice which he was never to decide A sudden
hurricane of shrieks and a rush of stumbling feet sent every one flocking
to the door The Dillot boy crashed into the room carrying in his arms
the vociferous and somewhat dishevelled Teresa Thundleford her clothing
was certainly not a mass of flames as the more excitable members of the
party afterwards declared but the edge of her skirt and part of the
tablecover in which she had been hastily wrapped were alight in a
flickering halfhearted manner Rex flung his struggling burden on the
billiard table and for one breathless minute the work of beating out the
sparks with rugs and cushions and playing on them with sodawater syphons
engrossed the energies of the entire company

It was lucky I was passing when it happened panted Rex some one had
better see to the room I think the carpet is alight

As a matter of fact the promptitude and energy of the rescuer had
prevented any great damage being done either to the victim or her
surroundings The billiard table had suffered most and had to be laid
up for repairs perhaps it was not the best place to have chosen for the
scene of salvage operations but then as Clovis remarked when one is
rushing about with a blazing woman in ones arms one cant stop to think
out exactly where one is going to put her




THEBULL


Tom Yorkfield had always regarded his halfbrother Laurence with a lazy
instinct of dislike toned down as years went on to a tolerant feeling
of indifference There was nothing very tangible to dislike him for he
was just a bloodrelation with whom Tom had no single taste or interest
in common and with whom at the same time he had had no occasion for
quarrel Laurence had left the farm early in life and had lived for a
few years on a small sum of money left him by his mother he had taken up
painting as a profession and was reported to be doing fairly well at it
well enough at any rate to keep body and soul together He specialised
in painting animals and he was successful in finding a certain number of
people to buy his pictures Tom felt a comforting sense of assured
superiority in contrasting his position with that of his halfbrother
Laurence was an artistchap just that and nothing more though you might
make it sound more important by calling an animal painter Tom was a
farmer not in a very big way it was true but the Helsery farm had been
in the family for some generations and it had a good reputation for the
stock raised on it Tom had done his best with the little capital at
his command to maintain and improve the standard of his small herd of
cattle and in Clover Fairy he had bred a bull which was something rather
better than any that his immediate neighbours could show It would not
have made a sensation in the judgingring at an important cattle show
but it was as vigorous shapely and healthy a young animal as any small
practical farmer could wish to possess At the Kings Head on market
days Clover Fairy was very highly spoken of and Yorkfield used to
declare that he would not part with him for a hundred pounds a hundred
pounds is a lot of money in the small farming line and probably anything
over eighty would have tempted him

It was with some especial pleasure that Tom took advantage of one of
Laurences rare visits to the farm to lead him down to the enclosure
where Clover Fairy kept solitary statethe grass widower of a grazing
harem Tom felt some of his old dislike for his halfbrother reviving
the artist was becoming more languid in his manner more unsuitably
turnedout in attire and he seemed inclined to impart a slightly
patronising tone to his conversation He took no heed of a flourishing
potato crop but waxed enthusiastic over a clump of yellowflowering weed
that stood in a corner by a gateway which was rather galling to the
owner of a really very well weeded farm again when he might have been
duly complimentary about a group of fat blackfaced lambs that simply
cried aloud for admiration he became eloquent over the foliage tints of
an oak copse on the hill opposite But now he was being taken to inspect
the crowning pride and glory of Helsery however grudging he might be in
his praises however backward and niggardly with his congratulations he
would have to see and acknowledge the many excellences of that
redoubtable animal Some weeks ago while on a business journey to
Taunton Tom had been invited by his halfbrother to visit a studio in
that town where Laurence was exhibiting one of his pictures a large
canvas representing a bull standing kneedeep in some marshy ground it
had been good of its kind no doubt and Laurence had seemed inordinately
pleased with it the best thing Ive done yet he had said over and
over again and Tom had generously agreed that it was fairly lifelike
Now the man of pigments was going to be shown a real picture a living
model of strength and comeliness a thing to feast the eyes on a picture
that exhibited new pose and action with every shifting minute instead of
standing glued into one unvarying attitude between the four walls of a
frame Tom unfastened a stout wooden door and led the way into a straw
bedded yard

Is he quiet asked the artist as a young bull with a curly red coat
came inquiringly towards them

Hes playful at times said Tom leaving his halfbrother to wonder
whether the bulls ideas of play were of the catchascatchcan order
Laurence made one or two perfunctory comments on the animals appearance
and asked a question or so as to his age and suchlike details then he
coolly turned the talk into another channel

Do you remember the picture I showed you at Taunton he asked

Yes grunted Tom a whitefaced bull standing in some slush Dont
admire those Herefords much myself bulkylooking brutes dont seem to
have much life in them Daresay theyre easier to paint that way now
this young beggar is on the move all the time arent you Fairy

Ive sold that picture said Laurence with considerable complacency in
his voice

Have you said Tom glad to hear it Im sure Hope youre pleased
with what youve got for it

I got three hundred pounds for it said Laurence

Tom turned towards him with a slowly rising flush of anger in his face
Three hundred pounds Under the most favourable market conditions that
he could imagine his prized Clover Fairy would hardly fetch a hundred
yet here was a piece of varnished canvas painted by his halfbrother
selling for three times that sum It was a cruel insult that went home
with all the more force because it emphasised the triumph of the
patronising selfsatisfied Laurence The young farmer had meant to put
his relative just a little out of conceit with himself by displaying the
jewel of his possessions and now the tables were turned and his valued
beast was made to look cheap and insignificant beside the price paid for
a mere picture It was so monstrously unjust the painting would never
be anything more than a dexterous piece of counterfeit life while Clover
Fairy was the real thing a monarch in his little world a personality in
the countryside After he was dead even he would still be something of
a personality his descendants would graze in those valley meadows and
hillside pastures they would fill stall and byre and milkingshed their
good red coats would speckle the landscape and crowd the marketplace
men would note a promising heifer or a wellproportioned steer and say
Ah that one comes of good old Clover Fairys stock All that time the
picture would be hanging lifeless and unchanging beneath its dust and
varnish a chattel that ceased to mean anything if you chose to turn it
with its back to the wall These thoughts chased themselves angrily
through Tom Yorkfields mind but he could not put them into words When
he gave tongue to his feelings he put matters bluntly and harshly

Some softwitted fools may like to throw away three hundred pounds on a
bit of paintwork cant say as I envy them their taste Id rather have
the real thing than a picture of it

He nodded towards the young bull that was alternately staring at them
with nose held high and lowering its horns with a halfplayful
halfimpatient shake of the head

Laurence laughed a laugh of irritating indulgent amusement

I dont think the purchaser of my bit of paintwork as you call it need
worry about having thrown his money away As I get to be better known
and recognised my pictures will go up in value That particular one will
probably fetch four hundred in a saleroom five or six years hence
pictures arent a bad investment if you know enough to pick out the work
of the right men Now you cant say your precious bull is going to get
more valuable the longer you keep him hell have his little day and
then if you go on keeping him hell come down at last to a few
shillingsworth of hoofs and hide just at a time perhaps when my bull
is being bought for a big sum for some important picture gallery

It was too much The united force of truth and slander and insult put
over heavy a strain on Tom Yorkfields powers of restraint In his right
hand he held a useful oak cudgel with his left he made a grab at the
loose collar of Laurences canarycoloured silk shirt Laurence was not
a fighting man the fear of physical violence threw him off his balance
as completely as overmastering indignation had thrown Tom off his and
thus it came to pass that Clover Fairy was regaled with the unprecedented
sight of a human being scudding and squawking across the enclosure like
the hen that would persist in trying to establish a nestingplace in the
manger In another crowded happy moment the bull was trying to jerk
Laurence over his left shoulder to prod him in the ribs while still in
the air and to kneel on him when he reached the ground It was only the
vigorous intervention of Tom that induced him to relinquish the last item
of his programme

Tom devotedly and ungrudgingly nursed his half brother to a complete
recovery from his injuries which consisted of nothing more serious than
a dislocated shoulder a broken rib or two and a little nervous
prostration After all there was no further occasion for rancour in the
young farmers mind Laurences bull might sell for three hundred or for
six hundred and be admired by thousands in some big picture gallery but
it would never toss a man over one shoulder and catch him a jab in the
ribs before he had fallen on the other side That was Clover Fairys
noteworthy achievement which could never be taken away from him

Laurence continues to be popular as an animal artist but his subjects
are always kittens or fawns or lambkinsnever bulls




MORLVERA


The Olympic Toy Emporium occupied a conspicuous frontage in an important
West End street It was happily named Toy Emporium because one would
never have dreamed of according it the familiar and yet pulsequickening
name of toyshop There was an air of cold splendour and elaborate
failure about the wares that were set out in its ample windows they were
the sort of toys that a tired shopassistant displays and explains at
Christmas time to exclamatory parents and bored silent children The
animal toys looked more like natural history models than the comfortable
sympathetic companions that one would wish at a certain age to take to
bed with one and to smuggle into the bathroom The mechanical toys
incessantly did things that no one could want a toy to do more than a
half a dozen times in its lifetime it was a merciful reflection that in
any rightminded nursery the lifetime would certainly be short

Prominent among the elegantlydressed dolls that filled an entire section
of the window frontage was a large hobbleskirted lady in a confection of
peachcoloured velvet elaborately set off with leopard skin accessories
if one may use such a conveniently comprehensive word in describing an
intricate feminine toilette She lacked nothing that is to be found in a
carefully detailed fashionplatein fact she might be said to have
something more than the average fashionplate female possesses in place
of a vacant expressionless stare she had character in her face It must
be admitted that it was bad character cold hostile inquisitorial with
a sinister lowering of one eyebrow and a merciless hardness about the
corners of the mouth One might have imagined histories about her by the
hour histories in which unworthy ambition the desire for money and an
entire absence of all decent feeling would play a conspicuous part

As a matter of fact she was not without her judges and biographers even
in this shopwindow stage of her career Emmeline aged ten and Bert
aged seven had halted on the way from their obscure back street to the
minnowstocked water of St Jamess Park and were critically examining
the hobbleskirted doll and dissecting her character in no very tolerant
spirit There is probably a latent enmity between the necessarily under
clad and the unnecessarily overdressed but a little kindness and good
fellowship on the part of the latter will often change the sentiment to
admiring devotion if the lady in peachcoloured velvet and leopard skin
had worn a pleasant expression in addition to her other elaborate
furnishings Emmeline at least might have respected and even loved her
As it was she gave her a horrible reputation based chiefly on a
secondhand knowledge of gilded depravity derived from the conversation of
those who were skilled in the art of novelette reading Bert filled in a
few damaging details from his own limited imagination

Shes a bad lot that one is declared Emmeline after a long
unfriendly stare er usbind ates er

E knocks er abart said Bert with enthusiasm

No e dont cos es dead she poisoned im slow and gradual so that
nobody didnt know Now she wants to marry a lord with eaps and eaps
of money Es got a wife already but shes going to poison er too

Shes a bad lot said Bert with growing hostility

Er mother ates her and shes afraid of er too cos shes got a
serkestic tongue always talking serkesms she is Shes greedy too if
theres fish going she eats er own share and er little girls as well
though the little girl is dellikit

She ad a little boy once said Bert but she pushed im into the
water when nobody wasnt looking

No she didnt said Emmeline she sent im away to be kep by poor
people so er usbind wouldnt know where e was They illtreat im
somethink cruel

Wots er nime asked Bert thinking that it was time that so
interesting a personality should be labelled

Er nime said Emmeline thinking hard er nimes Morlvera It was
as near as she could get to the name of an adventuress who figured
prominently in a cinema drama There was silence for a moment while the
possibilities of the name were turned over in the childrens minds

Those clothes shes got on aint paid for and never wont be said
Emmeline she thinks shell get the rich lord to pay for em but e
wont Es given er jools underds of pounds worth

E wont pay for the clothes said Bert with conviction Evidently
there was some limit to the weak good nature of wealthy lords

At that moment a motor carriage with liveried servants drew up at the
emporium entrance a large lady with a penetrating and rather hurried
manner of talking stepped out followed slowly and sulkily by a small
boy who had a very black scowl on his face and a very white sailor suit
over the rest of him The lady was continuing an argument which had
probably commenced in Portman Square

Now Victor you are to come in and buy a nice doll for your cousin
Bertha She gave you a beautiful box of soldiers on your birthday and
you must give her a present on hers

Bertha is a fat little fool said Victor in a voice that was as loud
as his mothers and had more assurance in it

Victor you are not to say such things Bertha is not a fool and she
is not in the least fat You are to come in and choose a doll for her

The couple passed into the shop out of view and hearing of the two back
street children

My he is in a wicked temper exclaimed Emmeline but both she and Bert
were inclined to side with him against the absent Bertha who was
doubtless as fat and foolish as he had described her to be

I want to see some dolls said the mother of Victor to the nearest
assistant its for a little girl of eleven

A fat little girl of eleven added Victor by way of supplementary
information

Victor if you say such rude things about your cousin you shall go to
bed the moment we get home without having any tea

This is one of the newest things we have in dolls said the assistant
removing a hobbleskirted figure in peachcoloured velvet from the
window leopard skin toque and stole the latest fashion You wont get
anything newer than that anywhere Its an exclusive design

Look whispered Emmeline outside theyve bin and took Morlvera

There was a mingling of excitement and a certain sense of bereavement in
her mind she would have liked to gaze at that embodiment of overdressed
depravity for just a little longer

I spect shes going away in a kerridge to marry the rich lord
hazarded Bert

Shes up to no good said Emmeline vaguely

Inside the shop the purchase of the doll had been decided on

Its a beautiful doll and Bertha will be delighted with it asserted
the mother of Victor loudly

Oh very well said Victor sulkily you neednt have it stuck into a
box and wait an hour while its being done up into a parcel Ill take
it as it is and we can go round to Manchester Square and give it to
Bertha and get the thing done with That will save me the trouble of
writing For dear Bertha with Victors love on a bit of paper

Very well said his mother we can go to Manchester Square on our way
home You must wish her many happy returns of tomorrow and give her
the doll

I wont let the little beast kiss me stipulated Victor

His mother said nothing Victor had not been half as troublesome as she
had anticipated When he chose he could really be dreadfully naughty

Emmeline and Bert were just moving away from the window when Morlvera
made her exit from the shop very carefully in Victors arms A look of
sinister triumph seemed to glow in her hard inquisitorial face As for
Victor a certain scornful serenity had replaced the earlier scowls he
had evidently accepted defeat with a contemptuous good grace

The tall lady gave a direction to the footman and settled herself in the
carriage The little figure in the white sailor suit clambered in beside
her still carefully holding the elegantly garbed doll

The car had to be backed a few yards in the process of turning Very
stealthily very gently very mercilessly Victor sent Morlvera flying
over his shoulder so that she fell into the road just behind the
retrogressing wheel With a soft pleasantsounding scrunch the car went
over the prostrate form then it moved forward again with another
scrunch The carriage moved off and left Bert and Emmeline gazing in
scared delight at a sorry mess of petrolsmeared velvet sawdust and
leopard skin which was all that remained of the hateful Morlvera They
gave a shrill cheer and then raced away shuddering from the scene of so
much rapidly enacted tragedy

Later that afternoon when they were engaged in the pursuit of minnows by
the waterside in St Jamess Park Emmeline said in a solemn undertone to
Bert

Ive bin finking Do you know oo e was E was er little boy wot
shed sent away to live wiv poor folks E come back and done that




SHOCK TATICS


On a late spring afternoon Ella McCarthy sat on a greenpainted chair in
Kensington Gardens staring listlessly at an uninteresting stretch of
park landscape that blossomed suddenly into tropical radiance as an
expected figure appeared in the middle distance

Hullo Bertie she exclaimed sedately when the figure arrived at the
painted chair that was the nearest neighbour to her own and dropped into
it eagerly yet with a certain due regard for the set of its trousers
hasnt it been a perfect spring afternoon

The statement was a distinct untruth as far as Ellas own feelings were
concerned until the arrival of Bertie the afternoon had been anything
but perfect

Bertie made a suitable reply in which a questioning note seemed to
hover

Thank you ever so much for those lovely handkerchiefs said Ella
answering the unspoken question they were just what Ive been wanting
Theres only one thing spoilt my pleasure in your gift she added with
a pout

What was that asked Bertie anxiously fearful that perhaps he had
chosen a size of handkerchief that was not within the correct feminine
limit

I should have liked to have written and thanked you for them as soon as
I got them said Ella and Berties sky clouded at once

You know what mother is he protested she opens all my letters and
if she found Id been giving presents to any one thered have been
something to talk about for the next fortnight

Surely at the age of twenty began Ella

Im not twenty till September interrupted Bertie

At the age of nineteen years and eight months persisted Ella you
might be allowed to keep your correspondence private to yourself

I ought to be but things arent always what they ought to be Mother
opens every letter that comes into the house whoever its for My
sisters and I have made rows about it time and again but she goes on
doing it

Id find some way to stop her if I were in your place said Ella
valiantly and Bertie felt that the glamour of his anxiously deliberated
present had faded away in the disagreeable restriction that hedged round
its acknowledgment

Is anything the matter asked Berties friend Clovis when they met that
evening at the swimmingbath

Why do you ask said Bertie

When you wear a look of tragic gloom in a swimmingbath said Clovis
its especially noticeable from the fact that youre wearing very little
else Didnt she like the handkerchiefs

Bertie explained the situation

It is rather galling you know he added when a girl has a lot of
things she wants to write to you and cant send a letter except by some
roundabout underhand way

One never realises ones blessings while one enjoys them said Clovis
now I have to spend a considerable amount of ingenuity inventing excuses
for not having written to people

Its not a joking matter said Bertie resentfully you wouldnt find
it funny if your mother opened all your letters

The funny thing to me is that you should let her do it

I cant stop it Ive argued about it

You havent used the right kind of argument I expect Now if every
time one of your letters was opened you lay on your back on the dining
table during dinner and had a fit or roused the entire family in the
middle of the night to hear you recite one of Blakes Poems of
Innocence you would get a far more respectful hearing for future
protests People yield more consideration to a mutilated mealtime or a
broken nights rest than ever they would to a broken heart

Oh dry up said Bertie crossly inconsistently splashing Clovis from
head to foot as he plunged into the water

It was a day or two after the conversation in the swimmingbath that a
letter addressed to Bertie Heasant slid into the letterbox at his home
and thence into the hands of his mother Mrs Heasant was one of those
emptyminded individuals to whom other peoples affairs are perpetually
interesting The more private they are intended to be the more acute is
the interest they arouse She would have opened this particular letter
in any case the fact that it was marked private and diffused a
delicate but penetrating aroma merely caused her to open it with headlong
haste rather than matterofcourse deliberation The harvest of
sensation that rewarded her was beyond all expectations

 Bertie carissimo it began I wonder if you will have the nerve to
 do it it will take some nerve too Dont forget the jewels They
 are a detail but details interest me

 Yours as ever Clotilde

 Your mother must not know of my existence If questioned swear you
 never heard of me

For years Mrs Heasant had searched Berties correspondence diligently
for traces of possible dissipation or youthful entanglements and at last
the suspicions that had stimulated her inquisitorial zeal were justified
by this one splendid haul That any one wearing the exotic name
Clotilde should write to Bertie under the incriminating announcement
as ever was sufficiently electrifying without the astounding allusion
to the jewels Mrs Heasant could recall novels and dramas wherein
jewels played an exciting and commanding role and here under her own
roof before her very eyes as it were her own son was carrying on an
intrigue in which jewels were merely an interesting detail Bertie was
not due home for another hour but his sisters were available for the
immediate unburdening of a scandalladen mind

Bertie is in the toils of an adventuress she screamed her name is
Clotilde she added as if she thought they had better know the worst at
once There are occasions when more harm than good is done by shielding
young girls from a knowledge of the more deplorable realities of life

By the time Bertie arrived his mother had discussed every possible and
improbable conjecture as to his guilty secret the girls limited
themselves to the opinion that their brother had been weak rather than
wicked

Who is Clotilde was the question that confronted Bertie almost before
he had got into the hall His denial of any knowledge of such a person
was met with an outburst of bitter laughter

How well you have learned your lesson exclaimed Mrs Heasant But
satire gave way to furious indignation when she realised that Bertie did
not intend to throw any further light on her discovery

You shant have any dinner till youve confessed everything she
stormed

Berties reply took the form of hastily collecting material for an
impromptu banquet from the larder and locking himself into his bedroom
His mother made frequent visits to the locked door and shouted a
succession of interrogations with the persistence of one who thinks that
if you ask a question often enough an answer will eventually result
Bertie did nothing to encourage the supposition An hour had passed in
fruitless onesided palaver when another letter addressed to Bertie and
marked private made its appearance in the letterbox Mrs Heasant
pounced on it with the enthusiasm of a cat that has missed its mouse and
to whom a second has been unexpectedly vouchsafed If she hoped for
further disclosures assuredly she was not disappointed

 So you have really done it the letter abruptly commenced Poor
 Dagmar Now she is done for I almost pity her You did it very well
 you wicked boy the servants all think it was suicide and there will
 be no fuss Better not touch the jewels till after the inquest

 Clotilde

Anything that Mrs Heasant had previously done in the way of outcry was
easily surpassed as she raced upstairs and beat frantically at her sons
door

Miserable boy what have you done to Dagmar

Its Dagmar now is it he snapped it will be Geraldine next

That it should come to this after all my efforts to keep you at home of
an evening sobbed Mrs Heasant its no use you trying to hide things
from me Clotildes letter betrays everything

Does it betray who she is asked Bertie Ive heard so much about her
I should like to know something about her homelife Seriously if you
go on like this I shall fetch a doctor Ive often enough been preached
at about nothing but Ive never had an imaginary harem dragged into the
discussion

Are these letters imaginary screamed Mrs Heasant what about the
jewels and Dagmar and the theory of suicide

No solution of these problems was forthcoming through the bedroom door
but the last post of the evening produced another letter for Bertie and
its contents brought Mrs Heasant that enlightenment which had already
dawned on her son

 Dear Bertie it ran I hope I havent distracted your brain with
 the spoof letters Ive been sending in the name of a fictitious
 Clotilde You told me the other day that the servants or somebody at
 your home tampered with your letters so I thought I would give any
 one that opened them something exciting to read The shock might do
 them good

 Yours

 Clovis Sangrail

Mrs Heasant knew Clovis slightly and was rather afraid of him It was
not difficult to read between the lines of his successful hoax In a
chastened mood she rapped once more at Berties door

A letter from Mr Sangrail Its all been a stupid hoax He wrote
those other letters Why where are you going

Bertie had opened the door he had on his hat and overcoat

Im going for a doctor to come and see if anythings the matter with
you Of course it was all a hoax but no person in his right mind could
have believed all that rubbish about murder and suicide and jewels
Youve been making enough noise to bring the house down for the last hour
or two

But what was I to think of those letters whimpered Mrs Heasant

I should have known what to think of them said Bertie if you choose
to excite yourself over other peoples correspondence its your own
fault Anyhow Im going for a doctor

It was Berties great opportunity and he knew it His mother was
conscious of the fact that she would look rather ridiculous if the story
got about She was willing to pay hushmoney

Ill never open your letters again she promised And Clovis has no
more devoted slave than Bertie Heasant




THE SEVEN CREAM JUGS


I suppose we shall never see Wilfred Pigeoncote here now that he has
become heir to the baronetcy and to a lot of money observed Mrs Peter
Pigeoncote regretfully to her husband

Well we can hardly expect to he replied seeing that we always
choked him off from coming to see us when he was a prospective nobody I
dont think Ive set eyes on him since he was a boy of twelve

There was a reason for not wanting to encourage his acquaintanceship
said Mrs Peter With that notorious failing of his he was not the sort
of person one wanted in ones house

Well the failing still exists doesnt it said her husband or do
you suppose a reform of character is entailed along with the estate

Oh of course there is still that drawback admitted the wife but
one would like to make the acquaintance of the future head of the family
if only out of mere curiosity Besides cynicism apart his being rich
will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing When
a man is absolutely wealthy not merely welltodo all suspicion of
sordid motive naturally disappears the thing becomes merely a tiresome
malady

Wilfrid Pigeoncote had suddenly become heir to his uncle Sir Wilfrid
Pigeoncote on the death of his cousin Major Wilfrid Pigeoncote who had
succumbed to the aftereffects of a polo accident A Wilfrid Pigeoncote
had covered himself with honours in the course of Marlboroughs
campaigns and the name Wilfrid had been a baptismal weakness in the
family ever since The new heir to the family dignity and estates was a
young man of about fiveandtwenty who was known more by reputation than
by person to a wide circle of cousins and kinsfolk And the reputation
was an unpleasant one The numerous other Wilfrids in the family were
distinguished one from another chiefly by the names of their residences
or professions as Wilfrid of Hubbledown and young Wilfrid the Gunner
but this particular scion was known by the ignominious and expressive
label of Wilfrid the Snatcher From his late schooldays onward he had
been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of kleptomania he had the
acquisitive instinct of the collector without any of the collectors
discrimination Anything that was smaller and more portable than a
sideboard and above the value of ninepence had an irresistible
attraction for him provided that it fulfilled the necessary condition of
belonging to some one else On the rare occasions when he was included
in a countryhouse party it was usual and almost necessary for his host
or some member of the family to make a friendly inquisition through his
baggage on the eve of his departure to see if he had packed up by
mistake any one elses property The search usually produced a large
and varied yield

This is funny said Peter Pigeoncote to his wife some halfhour after
their conversation heres a telegram from Wilfrid saying hes passing
through here in his motor and would like to stop and pay us his
respects Can stay for the night if it doesnt inconvenience us Signed
Wilfrid Pigeoncote Must be the Snatcher none of the others have a
motor I suppose hes bringing us a present for the silver wedding

Good gracious said Mrs Peter as a thought struck her this is
rather an awkward time to have a person with his failing in the house
All those silver presents set out in the drawingroom and others coming
by every post I hardly know what weve got and what are still to come
We cant lock them all up hes sure to want to see them

We must keep a sharp lookout thats all said Peter reassuringly

But these practised kleptomaniacs are so clever said his wife
apprehensively and it will be so awkward if he suspects that we are
watching him

Awkwardness was indeed the prevailing note that evening when the passing
traveller was being entertained The talk flitted nervously and
hurriedly from one impersonal topic to another The guest had none of
the furtive halfapologetic air that his cousins had rather expected to
find he was polite wellassured and perhaps just a little inclined
to put on side His hosts on the other hand wore an uneasy manner
that might have been the hallmark of conscious depravity In the drawing
room after dinner their nervousness and awkwardness increased

Oh we havent shown you the silverwedding presents said Mrs Peter
suddenly as though struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the
guest here they all are Such nice useful gifts A few duplicates
of course

Seven cream jugs put in Peter

Yes isnt it annoying went on Mrs Peter seven of them We feel
that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives Of course some of
them can be changed

Wilfrid occupied himself chiefly with such of the gifts as were of
antique interest carrying one or two of them over to the lamp to examine
their marks The anxiety of his hosts at these moments resembled the
solicitude of a cat whose newly born kittens are being handed round for
inspection

Let me see did you give me back the mustardpot This is its place
here piped Mrs Peter

Sorry I put it down by the claretjug said Wilfrid busy with
another object

Oh just let me have the sugarsifter again asked Mrs Peter dogged
determination showing through her nervousness I must label it who it
comes from before I forget

Vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory After they
had said Goodnight to their visitor Mrs Peter expressed her
conviction that he had taken something

I fancy by his manner that there was something up corroborated her
husband do you miss anything

Mrs Peters hastily counted the array of gifts

I can only make it thirtyfour and I think it should be thirtyfive
she announced I cant remember if thirtyfive includes the Archdeacons
cruetstand that hasnt arrived yet

How on earth are we to know said Peter The mean pig hasnt brought
us a present and Im hanged if he shall carry one off

Tomorrow whens he having his bath said Mrs Peter excitedly hes
sure to leave his keys somewhere and we can go through his portmanteau
Its the only thing to do

On the morrow an alert watch was kept by the conspirators behind half
closed doors and when Wilfrid clad in a gorgeous bathrobe had made
his way to the bathroom there was a swift and furtive rush by two
excited individuals towards the principal guestchamber Mrs Peter kept
guard outside while her husband first made a hurried and successful
search for the keys and then plunged at the portmanteau with the air of
a disagreeably conscientious Customs official The quest was a brief
one a silver cream jug lay embedded in the folds of some zephyr shirts

The cunning brute said Mrs Peters he took a cream jug because there
were so many he thought one wouldnt be missed Quick fly down with it
and put it back among the others

Wilfrid was late in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed
plainly that something was amiss

Its an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but
Im afraid you must have a thief among your servants Somethings been
taken out of my portmanteau It was a little present from my mother and
myself for your silver wedding I should have given it to you last night
after dinner only it happened to be a cream jug and you seemed annoyed
at having so many duplicates so I felt rather awkward about giving you
another I thought Id get it changed for something else and now its
gone

Did you say it was from your _mother_ and yourself asked Mr and Mrs
Peter almost in unison The Snatcher had been an orphan these many
years

Yes my mothers at Cairo just now and she wrote to me at Dresden to
try and get you something quaint and pretty in the old silver line and I
pitched on this cream jug

Both the Pigeoncotes had turned deadly pale The mention of Dresden had
thrown a sudden light on the situation It was Wilfrid the Attache a
very superior young man who rarely came within their social horizon
whom they had been entertaining unawares in the supposed character of
Wilfrid the Snatcher Lady Ernestine Pigeoncote his mother moved in
circles which were entirely beyond their compass or ambitions and the
son would probably one day be an Ambassador And they had rifled and
despoiled his portmanteau Husband and wife looked blankly and
desperately at one another It was Mrs Peter who arrived first at an
inspiration

How dreadful to think there are thieves in the house We keep the
drawingroom locked up at night of course but anything might be carried
off while we are at breakfast

She rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the
drawingroom was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a
moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands

There are eight cream jugs now instead of seven she cried this one
wasnt there before What a curious trick of memory Mr Wilfrid You
must have slipped downstairs with it last night and put it there before
we locked up and forgotten all about having done it in the morning

Ones mind often plays one little tricks like that said Mr Peter
with desperate heartiness Only the other day I went into the town to
pay a bill and went in again next day having clean forgotten that Id

It is certainly the jug I bought for you said Wilfrid looking closely
at it it was in my portmanteau when I got my bathrobe out this
morning before going to my bath and it was not there when I unlocked
the portmanteau on my return Some one had taken it while I was away
from the room

The Pigeoncotes had turned paler than ever Mrs Peter had a final
inspiration

Get me my smellingsalts dear she said to her husband I think
theyre in the dressingroom

Peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long
during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within
measurable distance

Mrs Peter turned to her guest with confidential coyness

A diplomat like you will know how to treat this as if it hadnt
happened Peters little weakness it runs in the family

Good Lord Do you mean to say hes a kleptomaniac like Cousin
Snatcher

Oh not exactly said Mrs Peter anxious to whitewash her husband a
little greyer than she was painting him He would never touch anything
he found lying about but he cant resist making a raid on things that
are locked up The doctors have a special name for it He must have
pounced on your portmanteau the moment you went to your bath and taken
the first thing he came across Of course he had no motive for taking a
cream jug weve already got _seven_ as you knownot of course that
we dont value the kind of gift you and your motherhush heres Peter
coming

Mrs Peter broke off in some confusion and tripped out to meet her
husband in the hall

Its all right she whispered to him Ive explained everything Dont
say anything more about it

Brave little woman said Peter with a gasp of relief I could never
have done it

    

Diplomatic reticence does not necessarily extend to family affairs Peter
Pigeoncote was never able to understand why Mrs Consuelo van Bullyon
who stayed with them in the spring always carried two very obvious jewel
cases with her to the bathroom explaining them to any one she chanced
to meet in the corridor as her manicure and facemassage set




THE OCCASIONAL GARDEN


Dont talk to me about town gardens said Elinor Rapsley which means
of course that I want you to listen to me for an hour or so while I talk
about nothing else What a nicesized garden youve got people said
to us when we first moved here What I suppose they meant to say was
what a nicesized site for a garden wed got As a matter of fact the
size is all against it its too large to be ignored altogether and
treated as a yard and its too small to keep giraffes in You see if
we could keep giraffes or reindeer or some other species of browsing
animal there we could explain the general absence of vegetation by a
reference to the fauna of the garden You cant have wapiti _and_ Darwin
tulips you know so we didnt put down any bulbs last year As it is
we havent got the wapiti and the Darwin tulips havent survived the
fact that most of the cats of the neighbourhood hold a parliament in the
centre of the tulip bed that rather forlorn looking strip that we
intended to be a border of alternating geranium and spiraea has been
utilised by the catparliament as a division lobby Snap divisions seem
to have been rather frequent of late far more frequent than the geranium
blooms are likely to be I shouldnt object so much to ordinary cats
but I do complain of having a congress of vegetarian cats in my garden
they must be vegetarians my dear because whatever ravages they may
commit among the sweet pea seedlings they never seem to touch the
sparrows there are always just as many adult sparrows in the garden on
Saturday as there were on Monday not to mention newlyfledged additions
There seems to have been an irreconcilable difference of opinion between
sparrows and Providence since the beginning of time as to whether a
crocus looks best standing upright with its roots in the earth or in a
recumbent posture with its stem neatly severed the sparrows always have
the last word in the matter at least in our garden they do I fancy
that Providence must have originally intended to bring in an amending
Act or whatever its called providing either for a less destructive
sparrow or a more indestructible crocus The one consoling point about
our garden is that its not visible from the drawingroom or the smoking
room so unless people are dinning or lunching with us they cant spy out
the nakedness of the land That is why I am so furious with Gwenda
Pottingdon who has practically forced herself on me for lunch on
Wednesday next she heard me offer the Paulcote girl lunch if she was up
shopping on that day and of course she asked if she might come too
She is only coming to gloat over my bedraggled and flowerless borders and
to sing the praises of her own detestably overcultivated garden Im
sick of being told that its the envy of the neighbourhood its like
everything else that belongs to herher car her dinnerparties even
her headaches they are all superlative no one else ever had anything
like them When her eldest child was confirmed it was such a sensational
event according to her account of it that one almost expected questions
to be asked about it in the House of Commons and now shes coming on
purpose to stare at my few miserable pansies and the gaps in my sweetpea
border and to give me a glowing fulllength description of the rare and
sumptuous blooms in her rosegarden

My dear Elinor said the Baroness you would save yourself all this
heartburning and a lot of gardeners bills not to mention sparrow
anxieties simply by paying an annual subscription to the OOSA

Never heard of it said Elinor what is it

The OccasionalOasis Supply Association said the Baroness it exists
to meet cases exactly like yours cases of backyards that are of no
practical use for gardening purposes but are required to blossom into
decorative scenic backgrounds at stated intervals when a luncheon or
dinnerparty is contemplated Supposing for instance you have people
coming to lunch at onethirty you just ring up the Association at about
ten oclock the same morning and say lunch garden That is all the
trouble you have to take By twelve fortyfive your yard is carpeted
with a strip of velvety turf with a hedge of lilac or red may or
whatever happens to be in season as a background one or two cherry
trees in blossom and clumps of heavilyflowered rhododendrons filling in
the odd corners in the foreground you have a blaze of carnations or
Shirley poppies or tiger lilies in full bloom As soon as the lunch is
over and your guests have departed the garden departs also and all the
cats in Christendom can sit in council in your yard without causing you a
moments anxiety If you have a bishop or an antiquary or something of
that sort coming to lunch you just mention the fact when you are ordering
the garden and you get an oldworld pleasaunce with clipped yew hedges
and a sundial and hollyhocks and perhaps a mulberry tree and borders
of sweetwilliams and Canterbury bells and an oldfashioned beehive or
two tucked away in a corner Those are the ordinary lines of supply that
the Oasis Association undertakes but by paying a few guineas a year
extra you are entitled to its emergency EON service

What on earth is an EON service

Its just a conventional signal to indicate special cases like the
incursion of Gwenda Pottingdon It means youve got some one coming to
lunch or dinner whose garden is alleged to be the envy of the
neighbourhood

Yes exclaimed Elinor with some excitement and what happens then

Something that sounds like a miracle out of the Arabian Nights Your
backyard becomes voluptuous with pomegranate and almond trees lemon
groves and hedges of flowering cactus dazzling banks of azaleas marble
basined fountains in which chestnutandwhite pondherons step daintily
amid exotic waterlilies while golden pheasants strut about on alabaster
terraces The whole effect rather suggests the idea that Providence and
Norman Wilkinson have dropped mutual jealousies and collaborated to
produce a background for an openair Russian Ballet in point of fact it
is merely the background to your luncheon party If there is any kick
left in Gwenda Pottingdon or whoever your EON guest of the moment may
be just mention carelessly that your climbing putella is the only one in
England since the one at Chatsworth died last winter There isnt such
a thing as a climbing putella but Gwenda Pottingdon and her kind dont
usually know one flower from another without prompting

Quick said Elinor the address of the Association

Gwenda Pottingdon did not enjoy her lunch It was a simple yet elegant
meal excellently cooked and daintily served but the piquant sauce of
her own conversation was notably lacking She had prepared a long
succession of eulogistic comments on the wonders of her town garden with
its unrivalled effects of horticultural magnificence and behold her
theme was shut in on every side by the luxuriant hedge of Siberian
berberis that formed a glowing background to Elinors bewildering
fragment of fairyland The pomegranate and lemon trees the terraced
fountain where golden carp slithered and wriggled amid the roots of
gorgeoushued irises the banked masses of exotic blooms the pagodalike
enclosure where Japanese sandbadgers disported themselves all these
contributed to take away Gwendas appetite and moderate her desire to
talk about gardening matters

I cant say I admire the climbing putella she observed shortly and
anyway its not the only one of its kind in England I happen to know of
one in Hampshire How gardening is going out of fashion I suppose
people havent the time for it nowadays

Altogether it was quite one of Elinors most successful luncheon parties

It was distinctly an unforeseen catastrophe that Gwenda should have burst
in on the household four days later at lunchtime and made her way
unbidden into the diningroom

I thought I must tell you that my Elaine has had a watercolour sketch
accepted by the Latent Talent Art Guild its to be exhibited at their
summer exhibition at the Hackney Gallery It will be the sensation of
the moment in the art worldHullo what on earth has happened to your
garden Its not there

Suffragettes said Elinor promptly didnt you hear about it They
broke in and made hay of the whole thing in about ten minutes I was so
heartbroken at the havoc that I had the whole place cleared out I shall
have it laid out again on rather more elaborate lines

That she said to the Baroness afterwards is what I call having an
emergency brain




THE SHEEP


The enemy had declared no trumps Rupert played out his ace and king
of clubs and cleared the adversary of that suit then the Sheep whom the
Fates had inflicted on him for a partner took the third round with the
queen of clubs and having no other club to lead back opened another
suit The enemy won the remainder of the tricksand the rubber

I had four more clubs to play we only wanted the odd trick to win the
rubber said Rupert

But I hadnt another club to lead you exclaimed the Sheep with his
ready defensive smile

It didnt occur to you to throw your queen away on my king and leave me
with the command of the suit said Rupert with polite bitterness

I suppose I ought to haveI wasnt certain what to do Im awfully
sorry said the Sheep

Being awfully and uselessly sorry formed a large part of his occupation
in life If a similar situation had arisen in a subsequent hand he would
have blundered just as certainly and he would have been just as
irritatingly apologetic

Rupert stared gloomily across at him as he sat smiling and fumbling with
his cards Many men who have good brains for business do not possess the
rudiments of a cardbrain and Rupert would not have judged and condemned
his prospective brotherinlaw on the evidence of his bridge play alone
The tragic part of it was that he smiled and fumbled through life just as
fatuously and apologetically as he did at the cardtable And behind the
defensive smile and the wellworn expressions of regret there shone a
scarcely believable but quite obvious selfsatisfaction Every sheep of
the pasture probably imagines that in an emergency it could become
terrible as an army with bannersone has only to watch how they stamp
their feet and stiffen their necks when a minor object of suspicion comes
into view and behaves meekly And probably the majority of human sheep
see themselves in imagination taking great parts in the worlds more
impressive dramas forming swift unerring decisions in moments of
crisis cowing mutinies allaying panics brave strong simple but in
spite of their natural modesty always slightly spectacular

Why in the name of all that is unnecessary and perverse should Kathleen
choose this man for her future husband was the question that Rupert
asked himself ruefully There was young Malcolm Athling as
nicelooking decent levelheaded a fellow as any one could wish to
meet obviously her very devoted admirer and yet she must throw herself
away on this paleeyed weakmouthed embodiment of selfapproving
ineptitude If it had been merely Kathleens own affair Rupert would
have shrugged his shoulders and philosophically hoped that she might make
the best of an undeniably bad bargain But Rupert had no heir his own
boy lay underground somewhere on the Indian frontier in goodly company
And the property would pass in due curse to Kathleen and Kathleens
husband The Sheep would live there in the beloved old home rearing up
other little Sheep fatuous and rabbitfaced and selfsatisfied like
himself to dwell in the land and possess it It was not a soothing
prospect

Towards dusk on the afternoon following the bridge experience Rupert and
the Sheep made their way homeward after a days mixed shooting The
Sheeps cartridge bag was nearly empty but his game bag showed no signs
of overcrowding The birds he had shot at had seemed for the most part
as impervious to death or damage as the hero of a melodrama And for
each failure to drop his bird he had some explanation or apology ready on
his lips Now he was striding along in front of his host chattering
happily over his shoulder but obviously on the lookout for some belated
rabbit or woodpigeon that might haply be secured as an eleventhhour
addition to his bag As they passed the edge of a small copse a large
bird rose from the ground and flew slowly towards the trees offering an
easy shot to the oncoming sportsmen The Sheep banged forth with both
barrels and gave an exultant cry

Horray Ive shot a thundering big hawk

To be exact youve shot a honeybuzzard That is the hen bird of one
of the few pairs of honeybuzzards breeding in the United Kingdom Weve
kept them under the strictest preservation for the last four years every
gamekeeper and village gun loafer for twenty miles round has been warned
and bribed and threatened to respect their sanctity and eggsnatching
agents have been carefully guarded against during the breeding season
Hundreds of lovers of rare birds have delighted in seeing their
snapshotted portraits in _Country Life_ and now youve reduced the hen
bird to a lump of broken feathers

Rupert spoke quietly and evenly but for a moment or two a gleam of
positive hatred shone in his eyes

I say Im so sorry said the Sheep with his apologetic smile Of
course I remember hearing about the buzzards but somehow I didnt
connect this bird with them And it was such an east shot

Yes said Rupert that was the trouble

Kathleen found him in the gunroom smoothing out the feathers of the dead
bird She had already been told of the catastrophe

What a horrid misfortune she said sympathetically

It was my dear Robbie who first discovered them the last time he was
home on leave Dont you remember how excited he was about them Lets
go and have some tea

Both bridge and shooting were given a rest for the next two or three
weeks Death who enters into no compacts with party whips had forced a
Parliamentary vacancy on the neighbourhood at the least convenient
season and the local partisans on either side found themselves immersed
in the discomforts of a midwinter election Rupert took his politics
seriously and keenly He belonged to that type of strangely but rather
happily constituted individuals which these islands seem to produce in a
fair plenty men and women who for no personal profit or gain go forth
from their comfortable firesides or club cardrooms to hunt to and fro in
the mud and rain and wind for the capture or tracking of a stray vote
here and there on their partys behalfnot because they think they ought
to but because they want to And his energies were welcome enough on
this occasion for the seat was a closely disputed possession and its
loss or retention would count for much in the present position of the
Parliamentary game With Kathleen to help him he had worked his corner
of the constituency with tireless welldirected zeal taking his share
of the dull routine work as well as of the livelier episodes The
talking part of the campaign wound up on the eve of the poll with a
meeting in a centre where more undecided votes were supposed to be
concentrated than anywhere else in the division A good final meeting
here would mean everything And the speakers local and imported left
nothing undone to improve the occasion Rupert was down for the
unimportant task of moving the complimentary vote to the chairman which
should close the proceedings

Im so hoarse he protested when the moment arrived I dont believe
I can make my voice heard beyond the platform

Let me do it said the Sheep Im rather good at that sort of thing

The chairman was popular with all parties and the Sheeps opening words
of complimentary recognition received a round of applause The orator
smiled expansively on his listeners and seized the opportunity to add a
few words of political wisdom on his own account People looked at the
clock or began to grope for umbrellas and discarded neckwraps Then in
the midst of a string of meaningless platitudes the Sheep delivered
himself of one of those blundering remarks which travel from one end of a
constituency to the other in half an hour and are seized on by the other
side as being more potent on their behalf than a ton of election
literature There was a general shuffling and muttering across the
length and breadth of the hall and a few hisses made themselves heard
The Sheep tried to whittle down his remark and the chairman
unhesitatingly threw him over in his speech of thanks but the damage was
done

Im afraid I lost touch with the audience rather over that remark said
the Sheep afterwards with his apologetic smile abnormally developed

You lost us the election said the chairman and he proved a true
prophet

A month or so of winter sport seemed a desirable pickmeup after the
strenuous work and crowning discomfiture of the election Rupert and
Kathleen hied them away to a small Alpine resort that was just coming
into prominence and thither the Sheep followed them in due course in
his role of husbandelect The wedding had been fixed for the end of
March

It was a winter of early and unseasonable thaws and the far end of the
local lake at a spot where swift currents flowed into it was decorated
with notices written in three languages warning skaters not to venture
over certain unsafe patches The folly of approaching too near these
danger spots seemed to have a natural fascination for the Sheep

I dont see what possible danger there can be he protested with his
inevitable smile when Rupert beckoned him away from the proscribed area
the milk that I put out on my windowsill last night was frozen an inch
deep

It hadnt got a strong current flowing through it said Rupert in any
case there is not much sense in hovering round a doubtful piece of ice
when there are acres of good ice to skate over The secretary of the ice
committee has warned you once already

A few minutes later Rupert heard a loud squeal of fear and saw a dark
spot blotting the smoothness of the lakes frozen surface The Sheep was
struggling helplessly in an icehole of his own making Rupert gave one
loud curse and then dashed full tilt for the shore outside a low stable
building on the lakes edge he remembered having seen a ladder If he
could slide it across the icehole before the Sheep went under the rescue
would be comparatively simple work Other skaters were dashing up from a
distance and with the ladders help they could get him out of his
deathtrap without having to trust themselves on the margin of rotten
ice Rupert sprang on to the surface of lumpy frozen snow and
staggered to where the ladder lay He had already lifted it when the
rattle of a chain and a furious outburst of growls burst on his hearing
and he was dashed to the ground by a mass of white and tawny fur A
sturdy young yarddog frantic with the pleasure of performing his first
piece of actice guardian service was ramping and snarling over him
rendering the task of regaining his feet or securing the ladder a matter
of considerable difficulty When he had at last succeeded in both
efforts he was just by a hairsbreadth too late to be of any use The
Sheep had definitely disappeared under the icerift

Kathleen Athling and her husband stay the greater part of the year with
Rupert and a small Robbie stands in some danger of being idolised by a
devoted uncle But for twelve months of the year Ruperts most
inseparable and valued companion is a sturdy tawny and white yarddog




THE OVERSIGHT


Its like a Chinese puzzle said Lady Prowche resentfully staring at a
scribbled list of names that spread over two or three loose sheets of
notepaper on her writingtable Most of the names had a pencil mark
running through them

What is like a Chinese puzzle asked Lena Luddleford briskly she
rather prided herself on being able to grapple with the minor problems of
life

Getting people suitably sorted together Sir Richard likes me to have a
house party about this time of year and gives me a free hand as to whom
I should invite all he asks is that it should be a peaceable party with
no friction or unpleasantness

That seems reasonable enough said Lena

Not only reasonable my dear but necessary Sir Richard has his
literary work to think of you cant expect a man to concentrate on the
tribal disputes of Central Asian clansmen when hes got social feuds
blazing under his own roof

But why should they blaze Why should there be feuds at all within the
compass of a house party

Exactly why should they blaze or why should they exist echoed Lady
Prowche the point is that they always do We have been unlucky
persistently unlucky now that I come to look back on things We have
always got people of violently opposed views under one roof and the
result has been not merely unpleasantness but explosion

Do you mean people who disagree on matters of political opinion and
religious views asked Lena

No not that The broader lines of political or religious difference
dont matter You can have Church of England and Unitarian and Buddhist
under the same roof without courting disaster the only Buddhist I ever
had down here quarrelled with everybody but that was on account of his
naturally squabblesome temperament it had nothing to do with his
religion And Ive always found that people can differ profoundly about
politics and meet on perfectly good terms at breakfast Now Miss Larbor
Jones who was staying here last year worships Lloyd George as a sort of
wingless angel while Mrs Walters who was down here at the same time
privately considers him to bean antelope let us say

An antelope

Well not an antelope exactly but something with horns and hoofs and
tail

Oh I see

Still that didnt prevent them from being the chummiest of mortals on
the tennis court and in the billiardroom They did quarrel finally
about a lead in a doubled hand of notrumps but that of course is a
thing that no account of judicious guestgrouping could prevent Mrs
Walters had got king knave ten and seven of clubs

You were saying that there were other lines of demarcation that caused
the bother interrupted Lena

Exactly It is the minor differences and sideissues that give so much
trouble said Lady Prowche not to my dying day shall I forget last
years upheaval over the Suffragette question Laura Henniseed left the
house in a state of speechless indignation but before she had reached
that state she had used language that would not have been tolerated in
the Austrian Reichsrath Intensive beargardening was Sir Richards
description of the whole affair and I dont think he exaggerated

Of course the Suffragette question is a burning one and lets loose the
most dreadful illfeeling said Lena but one can generally find out
beforehand what peoples opinions

My dear the year before it was worse It was Christian Science Selina
Goobie is a sort of High Priestess of the Cult and she put down all
opposition with a high hand Then one evening after dinner Clovis
Sangrail put a wasp down her back to see if her theory about the non
existence of pain could be depended on in an emergency The wasp was
small but very efficient and it had been soured in temper by being kept
in a paper cage all the afternoon Wasps dont stand confinement well
at least this one didnt I dont think I ever realised till that moment
what the word invective could be made to mean I sometimes wake in the
night and think I still hear Selina describing Cloviss conduct and
general character That was the year that Sir Richard was writing his
volume on Domestic Life in Tartary The critics all blamed it for a
lack of concentration

Hes engaged on a very important work this year isnt he asked Lena

Landtenure in Turkestan said Lady Prowche he is just at work on
the final chapters and they require all the concentration he can give
them That is why I am so very anxious not to have any unfortunate
disturbance this year I have taken every precaution I can think of to
bring nonconflicting and harmonious elements together the only two
people I am not quite easy about are the Atkinson man and Marcus Popham
They are the two who will be down here longest together and if they are
going to fall foul of one another about any burning question well there
will be more unpleasantness

Cant you find out anything about them About their opinions I mean

Anything My dear Lena theres scarcely anything that I havent found
out about them Theyre both of them moderate Liberal Evangelical
mildly opposed to female suffrage they approve of the Falconer Report
and the Stewards decision about Craganour Thank goodness in this
country we dont fly into violent passions about Wagner and Brahms and
things of that sort There is only one thorny subject that I havent
been able to make sure about the only stone that I have left unturned
Are they unanimously antivivisectionist or do they both uphold the
necessity for scientific experiment There has been a lot of
correspondence on the subject in our local newspapers of late and the
vicar is certain to preach a sermon about it vicars are dreadfully
provocative at times Now if you could only find out for me whether
these two men are divergently for or against

I exclaimed Lena how am I to find out I dont know either of them
to speak to

Still you might discover in some roundabout way Write to them under
as assumed name of course for subscriptions to one or other causeor
better still send a stamped typewritten reply postcard with a request
for a declaration for or against vivisection people who would hesitate
to commit themselves to a subscription will cheerfully write Yes or No on
a prepaid postcard If you cant manage it that way try and meet them
at some ones house and get into argument on the subject I think Milly
occasionally has one or other of them at her athomes you might have the
luck to meet both of them there the same evening Only it must be done
soon My invitations ought to go out by Wednesday or Thursday at the
latest and today is Friday

Millys athomes are not very amusing as a rule said Lena and one
never gets a chance of talking uninterruptedly to any one for a couple of
minutes at a time Milly is one of those restless hostesses who always
seem to be trying to see how you look in different parts of the room in
fresh grouping effects Even if I got to speak to Popham or Atkinson I
couldnt plunge into a topic like vivisection straight away No I think
the postcard scheme would be more hopeful and decidedly less tiresome
How would it be best to word them

Oh something like this Are you in favour of experiments on living
animals for the purpose of scientific researchYes or No That is
quite simple and unmistakable If they dont answer it will at least be
an indication that they are indifferent about the subject and that is
all I want to know

All right said Lena Ill get my brotherinlaw to let me have them
addressed to his office and he can telephone the result of the
plebiscite direct to you

Thank you ever so much said Lady Prowche gratefully and be sure to
get the cards sent off as soon as possible

On the following Tuesday the voice of an office clerk speaking through
the telephone informed Lady Prowche that the postcard poll showed
unanimous hostility to experiments on living animals

Lady Prowche thanked the office clerk and in a louder and more fervent
voice she thanked Heaven The two invitations already sealed and
addressed were immediately dispatched in due course they were both
accepted The house party of the halcyon hours as the prospective
hostess called it was auspiciously launched

Lena Luddleford was not included among the guests having previously
committed herself to another invitation At the opening day of a cricket
festival however she ran across Lady Prowche who had motored over from
the other side of the county She wore the air of one who is not
interested in cricket and not particularly interested in life She shook
hands limply with Lena and remarked that it was a beastly day

The party how has it gone off asked Lena quickly

Dont speak of it was the tragical answer why do I always have such
rotten luck

But what has happened

It has been awful Hyaenas could not have behaved with greater
savagery Sir Richard said so and he has been in countries where hyaenas
live so he ought to know They actually came to blows

Blows

Blows and curses It really might have been a scene from one of
Hogarths pictures I never felt so humiliated in my life What the
servants must have thought

But who were the offenders

Oh naturally the very two that we took all the trouble about

I thought they agreed on every subject that one could violently disagree
aboutreligion politics vivisection the Derby decision the Falconer
Report what else was there left to quarrel about

My dear we were fools not to have thought of it One of them was Pro
Greek and the other ProBulgar




HYACINTH


The new fashion of introducing the candidates children into an election
contest is a pretty one said Mrs Panstreppon it takes away something
from the acerbity of party warfare and it makes an interesting
experience for children to look back on in after years Still if you
will listen to my advice Matilda you will not take Hyacinth with you
down to Luffbridge on election day

Not take Hyacinth exclaimed his mother but why not Jutterly is
bringing his three children and they are going to drive a pair of Nubian
donkeys about the town to emphasise the fact that their father has been
appointed Colonial Secretary We are making the demand for a strong Navy
a special feature in _our_ campaign and it will be particularly
appropriate to have Hyacinth dressed in his sailor suit Hell look
heavenly

The question is not how hell look but how hell behave Hes a
delightful child of course but there is a strain of unbridled pugnacity
in him that breaks out at times in a really alarming fashion You may
have forgotten the affair of the little Gaffin children I havent

I was in India at the time and Ive only a vague recollection of what
happened he was very naughty I know

He was in his goatcarriage and met the Gaffins in their perambulator
and he drove the goat full tilt at them and sent the perambulator
spinning Little Jacky Gaffin was pinned down under the wreckage and
while the nurse had her hands full with the goat Hyacinth was laying into
Jackys legs with his belt like a small fury

Im not defending him said Matilda but they must have done something
to annoy him

Nothing intentionally but some one had unfortunately told him that they
were half Frenchtheir mother was a Duboc you knowand he had been
having a history lesson that morning and had just heard of the final
loss of Calais by the English and was furious about it He said hed
teach the little toads to go snatching towns from us but we didnt know
at the time that he was referring to the Gaffins I told him afterwards
that all bad feeling between the two nations had died out long ago and
that anyhow the Gaffins were only half French and he said that it was
only the French half of Jacky that he had been hitting the rest had been
buried under the perambulator If the loss of Calais unloosed such fury
in him I tremble to think what the possible loss of the election might
entail

All that happened when he was eight hes older now and knows better

Children with Hyacinths temperament dont know better as they grow
older they merely know more

Nonsense He will enjoy the fun of the election and in any case hell
be tired out by the time the poll is declared and the new sailor suit
that Ive had made for him is just in the right shade of blue for our
election colours and it will exactly match the blue of his eyes He
will be a perfectly charming note of colour

There is such a thing as letting ones aesthetic sense override ones
moral sense said Mrs Panstreppon I believe you would have condoned
the South Sea Bubble and the persecution of the Albigenses if they had
been carried out in effective colour schemes However if anything
unfortunate should happen down at Luffbridge dont say it wasnt
foreseen by one member of the family

The election was keenly but decorously contested The newlyappointed
Colonial Secretary was personally popular while the Government to which
he adhered was distinctly unpopular and there was some expectancy that
the majority of four hundred obtained at the last election would be
altogether wiped out Both sides were hopeful but neither could feel
confident The children were a great success the little Jutterlys drove
their chubby donkeys solemnly up and down the main streets displaying
posters which advocated the claims of their father on the broad general
grounds that he was their father while as for Hyacinth his conduct
might have served as a model for any seraphchild that had strayed
unwittingly on to the scene of an electoral contest Of his own accord
and under the delighted eyes of half a dozen camera operators he had
gone up to the Jutterly children and presented them with a packet of
butterscotch we neednt be enemies because were wearing the opposite
colours he said with engaging friendliness and the occupants of the
donkeycart accepted his offering with polite solemnity The grownup
members of both political camps were delighted at the incidentwith the
exception of Mrs Panstreppon who shuddered

Never was Clytemnestras kiss sweeter than on the night she slew me
she quoted but made the quotation to herself

The last hour of the poll was a period of unremitting labour for both
parties it was generally estimated that not more than a dozen votes
separated the candidates and every effort was made to bring up
obstinately wavering electors It was with a feeling of relaxation and
relief that every one heard the clocks strike the hour for the close of
the poll Exclamations broke out from the tired workers and corks flew
out from bottles

Well if we havent won weve done our level best It has been a
clean straight fight with no rancour The children were quite a
charming feature werent they

The children It suddenly occurred to everybody that they had seen
nothing of the children for the last hour What had become of the three
little Jutterlys and their donkeycart and for the matter of that what
had become of Hyacinth Hurried anxious embassies went backwards and
forwards between the respective party headquarters and the various
committeerooms but there was blank ignorance everywhere as to the
whereabouts of the children Every one had been too busy in the closing
moments of the poll to bestow a thought on them Then there came a
telephone call at the Unionist Womens Committeerooms and the voice of
Hyacinth was heard demanding when the poll would be declared

Where are you and where are the Jutterly children asked his mother

Ive just finished having hightea at a pastrycooks came the answer
and they let me telephone Ive had a poached egg and a sausage roll
and four meringues

Youll be ill Are the little Jutterlys with you

Rather not Theyre in a pigstye

A pigstye Why What pigstye

Near the Crawleigh Road I met them driving about a back road and told
them they were to have tea with me and put their donkeys in a yard that
I knew of Then I took them to see an old sow that had got ten little
pigs I got the sow into the outer stye by giving her bits of bread
while the Jutterlys went in to look at the litter then I bolted the door
and left them there

You wicked boy do you mean to say youve left those poor children there
alone in the pigstye

Theyre not alone theyve got ten little pigs in with them theyre
jolly well crowded They were pretty mad at being shut in but not half
as mad as the old sow is at being shut out from her young ones If she
gets in while theyre there shell bite them into mincemeat I can get
them out by letting a short ladder down through the top window and
thats what Im going to do _if we win_ If their blighted father gets
in Im just going to open the door for the sow and let her do what she
dashed well likes to them Thats why I want to know when the poll will
be declared

Here the narrator rang off A wild stampede and a frantic sendingoff of
messengers took place at the other end of the telephone Nearly all the
workers on either side had disappeared to their various clubrooms and
publichouse bars to await the declaration of the poll but enough local
information could be secured to determine the scene of Hyacinths
exploit Mr John Ball had a stable yard down near the Crawleigh Road
up a short lane and his sow was known to have a litter of ten young
ones Thither went in headlong haste both the candidates Hyacinths
mother his aunt Mrs Panstreppon and two or three hurriedlysummoned
friends The two Nubian donkeys contentedly munching at bundles of hay
met their gaze as they entered the yard The hoarse savage grunting of
an enraged animal and the shriller note of thirteen young voices three
of them human guided them to the stye in the outer yard of which a huge
Yorkshire sow kept up a ceaseless raging patrol before a closed door
Reclining on the broad ledge of an open window from which point of
vantage he could reach down and shoot the bolt of the door was Hyacinth
his blue sailorsuit somewhat the worse of wear and his angel smile
exchanged for a look of demoniacal determination

If any of you come a step nearer he shouted the sow will be inside
in half a jiffy

A storm of threatening arguing entreating expostulation broke from the
baffled rescue party but it made no more impression on Hyacinth than the
squealing tempest that raged within the stye

If Jutterly heads the poll Im going to let the sow in Ill teach the
blighters to win elections from us

He means it said Mrs Panstreppon I feared the worst when I saw that
butterscotch incident

Its all right my little man said Jutterly with the duplicity to
which even a Colonial Secretary can sometimes stoop your father has
been elected by a large majority

Liar retorted Hyacinth with the directness of speech that is not
merely excusable but almost obligatory in the political profession
the votes arent counted yet You wont gammon me as to the result
either A boy that Ive palled with is going to fire a gun when the poll
is declared two shots if weve won one shot if we havent

The situation began to look critical Drug the sow whispered
Hyacinths father

Some one went off in the motor to the nearest chemists shop and returned
presently with two large pieces of bread liberally dosed with narcotic
The bread was thrown deftly and unostentatiously into the stye but
Hyacinth saw through the manoeuvre He set up a piercing imitation of a
small pig in Purgatory and the infuriated mother ramped round and round
the stye the pieces of bread were trampled into slush

At any moment now the poll might be declared Jutterly flew back to the
Town Hall where the votes were being counted His agent met him with a
smile of hope

Youre eleven ahead at present and only about eighty more to be
counted youre just going to squeak through

I mustnt squeak through exclaimed Jutterly hoarsely You must
object to every doubtful vote on our side that can possibly be
disallowed I must _not_ have the majority

Then was seen the unprecedented sight of a party agent challenging the
votes on his own side with a captiousness that his opponents would have
hesitated to display One or two votes that would have certainly passed
muster under ordinary circumstances were disallowed but even so Jutterly
was six ahead with only thirty more to be counted

To the watchers by the stye the moments seemed intolerable As a last
resort some one had been sent for a gun with which to shoot the sow
though Hyacinth would probably draw the bolt the moment such a weapon was
brought into the yard Nearly all the men were away from their homes
however on election night and the messenger had evidently gone far
afield in his search It must be a matter of minutes now to the
declaration of the poll

A sudden roar of shouting and cheering was heard from the direction of
the Town Hall Hyacinths father clutched a pitchfork and prepared to
dash into the stye in the forlorn hope of being in time

A shot rang out in the evening air Hyacinth stooped down from his perch
and put his finger on the bolt The sow pressed furiously against the
door

Bang came another shot

Hyacinth wriggled back and sent a short ladder down through the window
of the inner stye

Now you can come up you unclean little blighters he sang out my
daddys got in not yours Hurry up I cant keep the sow waiting much
longer And dont you jolly well come butting into any election again
where Im on the job

In the reaction that set in after the deliverance furious recrimination
were indulged in by the lately opposed candidates their women folk
agents and party helpers A recount was demanded but failed to
establish the fact that the Colonial Secretary had obtained a majority
Altogether the election left a legacy of soreness behind it apart from
any that was experienced by Hyacinth in person

It is the last time I shall let him go to an election exclaimed his
mother

There I think you are going to extremes said Mrs Panstreppon if
there should be a general election in Mexico I think you might safely let
him go there but I doubt whether our English politics are suited to the
rough and tumble of an angelchild




THE IMAGE OF THE LOST SOUL


There were a number of carved stone figures placed at intervals along the
parapets of the old Cathedral some of them represented angels others
kings and bishops and nearly all were in attitudes of pious exaltation
and composure But one figure low down on the cold north side of the
building had neither crown mitre not nimbus and its face was hard and
bitter and downcast it must be a demon declared the fat blue pigeons
that roosted and sunned themselves all day on the ledges of the parapet
but the old belfry jackdaw who was an authority on ecclesiastical
architecture said it was a lost soul And there the matter rested

One autumn day there fluttered on to the Cathedral roof a slender sweet
voiced bird that had wandered away from the bare fields and thinning
hedgerows in search of a winter roostingplace It tried to rest its
tired feet under the shade of a great angelwing or to nestle in the
sculptured folds of a kingly robe but the fat pigeons hustled it away
from wherever it settled and the noisy sparrowfolk drove it off the
ledges No respectable bird sang with so much feeling they cheeped one
to another and the wanderer had to move on

Only the effigy of the Lost Soul offered a place of refuge The pigeons
did not consider it safe to perch on a projection that leaned so much out
of the perpendicular and was besides too much in the shadow The
figure did not cross its hands in the pious attitude of the other graven
dignitaries but its arms were folded as in defiance and their angle made
a snug restingplace for the little bird Every evening it crept
trustfully into its corner against the stone breast of the image and the
darkling eyes seemed to keep watch over its slumbers The lonely bird
grew to love its lonely protector and during the day it would sit from
time to time on some rainshoot or other abutment and trill forth its
sweetest music in grateful thanks for its nightly shelter And it may
have been the work of wind and weather or some other influence but the
wild drawn face seemed gradually to lose some of its hardness and
unhappiness Every day through the long monotonous hours the song of
his little guest would come up in snatches to the lonely watcher and at
evening when the vesperbell was ringing and the great grey bats slid
out of their hidingplaces in the belfry roof the brighteyed bird would
return twitter a few sleepy notes and nestle into the arms that were
waiting for him Those were happy days for the Dark Image Only the
great bell of the Cathedral rang out daily its mocking message After
joy    sorrow

The folk in the vergers lodge noticed a little brown bird flitting about
the Cathedral precincts and admired its beautiful singing But it is a
pity said they that all that warbling should be lost and wasted far
out of hearing up on the parapet They were poor but they understood
the principles of political economy So they caught the bird and put it
in a little wicker cage outside the lodge door

That night the little songster was missing from its accustomed haunt and
the Dark Image knew more than ever the bitterness of loneliness Perhaps
his little friend had been killed by a prowling cat or hurt by a stone
Perhaps    perhaps he had flown elsewhere But when morning came
there floated up to him through the noise and bustle of the Cathedral
world a faint heartaching message from the prisoner in the wicker cage
far below And every day at high noon when the fat pigeons were
stupefied into silence after their midday meal and the sparrows were
washing themselves in the streetpuddles the song of the little bird
came up to the parapetsa song of hunger and longing and hopelessness a
cry that could never be answered The pigeons remarked between
mealtimes that the figure leaned forward more than ever out of the
perpendicular

One day no song came up from the little wicker cage It was the coldest
day of the winter and the pigeons and sparrows on the Cathedral roof
looked anxiously on all sides for the scraps of food which they were
dependent on in hard weather

Have the lodgefolk thrown out anything on to the dustheap inquired
one pigeon of another which was peering over the edge of the north
parapet

Only a little dead bird was the answer

There was a crackling sound in the night on the Cathedral roof and a
noise as of falling masonry The belfry jackdaw said the frost was
affecting the fabric and as he had experienced many frosts it must have
been so In the morning it was seen that the Figure of the Lost Soul had
toppled from its cornice and lay now in a broken mass on the dustheap
outside the vergers lodge

It is just as well cooed the fat pigeons after they had peered at the
matter for some minutes now we shall have a nice angel put up there
Certainly they will put an angel there

After joy    sorrow rang out the great bell




THE PURPLE OF THE BALKAN KINGS


Luitpold Wolkenstein financier and diplomat on a small obtrusive self
important scale sat in his favoured cafe in the worldwise Habsburg
capital confronted with the _Neue Freie Presse_ and the cup of cream
topped coffee and attendant glass of water that a sleekheaded piccolo
had just brought him For years longer than a dogs lifetime
sleekheaded piccolos had placed the _Neue Freie Presse_ and a cup of
creamtopped coffee on his table for years he had sat at the same spot
under the dustcoated stuffed eagle that had once been a living
soaring bird on the Styrian mountains and was now made monstrous and
symbolical with a second head grafted on to its neck and a gilt crown
planted on either dusty skull Today Luitpold Wolkenstein read no more
than the first article in his paper but read it again and again

The Turkish fortress of Kirk Kilisseh has fallen    The Serbs it is
officially announced have taken Kumanovo    The fortress of Kirk
Kilisseh lost Kumanovo taken by the Serbs these are tiding for
Constantinople resembling something out of Shakspeares tragedies of the
kings    The neighbourhood of Adrianople and the Eastern region
where the great battle is now in progress will not reveal merely the
future of Turkey but also what position and what influence the Balkan
States are to have in the world

For years longer than a dogs lifetime Luitpold Wolkenstein had disposed
of the pretensions and strivings of the Balkan States over the cup of
creamtopped coffee that sleekheaded piccolos had brought him Never
travelling further eastward than the horsefair at Temesvar never
inviting personal risk in an encounter with anything more potentially
desperate than a hare or partridge he had constituted himself the
critical appraiser and arbiter of the military and national prowess of
the small countries that fringed the Dual Monarchy on its Danube border
And his judgment had been one of unsparing contempt for smallscale
efforts of unquestioning respect for the big battalions and full purses
Over the whole scene of the Balkan territories and their troubled
histories had loomed the commanding magic of the words the Great
Powerseven more imposing in their Teutonic rendering Die
Grossmachte

Worshipping power and force and moneymastery as an elderly nerveridden
woman might worship youthful physical energy the comfortable
plumpbodied cafeoracle had jested and gibed at the ambitions of the
Balkan kinglets and their peoples had unloosed against them that battery
of strange lipsounds that a Viennese employs almost as an auxiliary
language to express the thoughts when his thoughts are not complimentary
British travellers had visited the Balkan lands and reported high things
of the Bulgarians and their future Russian officers had taken peeps at
their army and confessed this is a thing to be reckoned with and it is
not we who have created it they have done it by themselves But over
his cups of coffee and his hourlong games of dominoes the oracle had
laughed and wagged his head and distilled the worldly wisdom of his
castle The Grossmachte had not succeeded in stifling the roll of the
wardrum that was true the big battalions of the Ottoman Empire would
have to do some talking and then the big purses and big threatenings of
the Powers would speak and the last word would be with them In
imagination Luitpold heard the onward tramp of the redfezzed bayonet
bearers echoing through the Balkan passes saw the little sheepskinclad
mannikins driven back to their villages saw the augustly chiding
spokesman of the Powers dictating adjusting restoring settling things
once again in their allotted places sweeping up the dust of conflict
and now his ears had to listen to the wardrum rolling in quite another
direction had to listen to the tramp of battalions that were bigger and
bolder and better skilled in warcraft than he had deemed possible in
that quarter his eyes had to read in the columns of his accustomed
newspaper a warning to the Grossmachte that they had something new to
learn something new to reckon with much that was timehonoured to
relinquish The Great Powers will have not little difficulty in
persuading the Balkan States of the inviolability of the principle that
Europe cannot permit any fresh partition of territory in the East without
her approval Even now while the campaign is still undecided there are
rumours of a project of fiscal unity extending over the entire Balkan
lands and further of a constitutional union in imitation of the German
Empire That is perhaps only a political straw blown by the storm but
it is not possible to dismiss the reflection that the Balkan States
leagued together command a military strength with which the Great Powers
will have to reckon    The people who have poured out their blood on
the battlefields and sacrificed the available armed men of an entire
generation in order to encompass a union with their kinsfolk will not
remain any longer in an attitude of dependence on the Great Powers or on
Russia but will go their own ways    The blood that has been poured
forth today gives for the first time a genuine tone to the purple of the
Balkan Kings The Great Powers cannot overlook the fact that a people
that has tasted victory will not let itself be driven back again within
its former limits Turkey has lost today not only Kirk Kilisseh and
Kumanovo but Macedonia also

Luitpold Wolkenstein drank his coffee but the flavour had somehow gone
out of it His world his pompous imposing dictating world had
suddenly rolled up into narrower dimensions The big purses and the big
threats had been pushed unceremoniously on one side a force that he
could not fathom could not comprehend had made itself rudely felt The
august Caesars of Mammon and armament had looked down frowningly on the
combat and those about to die had not saluted had no intention of
saluting A lesson was being imposed on unwilling learners a lesson of
respect for certain fundamental principles and it was not the small
struggling States who were being taught the lesson

Luitpold Wolkenstein did not wait for the quorum of domino players to
arrive They would all have read the article in the _Freie Presse_ And
there are moments when an oracle finds its greatest salvation in
withdrawing itself from the area of human questioning




THE CUPBOARD OF THE YESTERDAYS


War is a cruelly destructive thing said the Wanderer dropping his
newspaper to the floor and staring reflectively into space

Ah yes indeed said the Merchant responding readily to what seemed
like a safe platitude when one thinks of the loss of life and limb the
desolated homesteads the ruined

I wasnt thinking of anything of the sort said the Wanderer I was
thinking of the tendency that modern war has to destroy and banish the
very elements of picturesqueness and excitement that are its chief excuse
and charm It is like a fire that flares up brilliantly for a while and
then leaves everything blacker and bleaker than before After every
important war in SouthEast Europe in recent times there has been a
shrinking of the area of chronically disturbed territory a stiffening
of frontier lines an intrusion of civilised monotony And imagine what
may happen at the conclusion of this war if the Turk should really be
driven out of Europe

Well it would be a gain to the cause of good government I suppose
said the Merchant

But have you counted the loss said the other The Balkans have long
been the last surviving shred of happy huntingground for the
adventurous a playground for passions that are fast becoming atrophied
for want of exercise In old bygone days we had the wars in the Low
Countries always at our doors as it were there was no need to go far
afield into malariastricken wilds if one wanted a life of boot and
saddle and licence to kill and be killed Those who wished to see life
had a decent opportunity for seeing death at the same time

It is scarcely right to talk of killing and bloodshed in that way said
the Merchant reprovingly one must remember that all men are brothers

One must also remember that a large percentage of them are younger
brothers instead of going into bankruptcy which is the usual tendency
of the younger brother nowadays they gave their families a fair chance
of going into mourning Every bullet finds a billet according to a
rather optimistic proverb and you must admit that nowadays it is
becoming increasingly difficult to find billets for a lot of young
gentlemen who would have adorned and probably thoroughly enjoyed one of
the oldtime happygolucky wars But that is not exactly the burden of
my complaint The Balkan lands are especially interesting to us in these
rapidlymoving days because they afford us the last remaining glimpse of
a vanishing period of European history When I was a child one of the
earliest events of the outside world that forced itself coherently under
my notice was a war in the Balkans I remember a sunburnt soldierly man
putting little pinflags in a warmap red flags for the Turkish forces
and yellow flags for the Russians It seemed a magical region with its
mountain passes and frozen rivers and grim battlefields its drifting
snows and prowling wolves there was a great stretch of water that bore
the sinister but engaging name of the Black Seanothing that I ever
learned before or after in a geography lesson made the same impression on
me as that strangenamed inland sea and I dont think its magic has ever
faded out of my imagination And there was a battle called Plevna that
went on and on with varying fortunes for what seemed like a great part of
a lifetime I remember the day of wrath and mourning when the little red
flag had to be taken away from Plevnalike other maturer judges I was
backing the wrong horse at any rate the losing horse And now today we
are putting little pinflags again into maps of the Balkan region and
the passions are being turned loose once more in their playground

The war will be localised said the Merchant vaguely at least every
one hopes so

It couldnt wish for a better locality said the Wanderer there is a
charm about those countries that you find nowhere else in Europe the
charm of uncertainty and landslide and the little dramatic happenings
that make all the difference between the ordinary and the desirable

Life is held very cheap in those parts said the Merchant

To a certain extent yes said the Wanderer I remember a man at
Sofia who used to teach me Bulgarian in a rather inefficient manner
interspersed with a lot of quite wearisome gossip I never knew what his
personal history was but that was only because I didnt listen he told
it to me many times After I left Bulgaria he used to send me Sofia
newspapers from time to time I felt that he would be rather tiresome if
I ever went there again And then I heard afterwards that some men came
in one day from Heaven knows where just as things do happen in the
Balkans and murdered him in the open street and went away as quietly as
they had come You will not understand it but to me there was something
rather piquant in the idea of such a thing happening to such a man after
his dullness and his longwinded smalltalk it seemed a sort of brilliant
_esprit desalier_ on his part to meet with an end of such ruthlessly
planned and executed violence

The Merchant shook his head the piquancy of the incident was not within
striking distance of his comprehension

I should have been shocked at hearing such a thing about any one I had
known he said

The present war continued his companion without stopping to discuss
two hopelessly divergent points of view may be the beginning of the end
of much that has hitherto survived the resistless creepingin of
civilisation If the Balkan lands are to be finally parcelled out
between the competing Christian Kingdoms and the haphazard rule of the
Turk banished to beyond the Sea of Marmora the old order or disorder if
you like will have received its deathblow Something of its spirit
will linger perhaps for a while in the old charmed regions where it bore
sway the Greek villagers will doubtless be restless and turbulent and
unhappy where the Bulgars rule and the Bulgars will certainly be
restless and turbulent and unhappy under Greek administration and the
rival flocks of the Exarchate and Patriarchate will make themselves
intensely disagreeable to one another wherever the opportunity offers
the habits of a lifetime of several lifetimes are not laid aside all at
once And the Albanians of course we shall have with us still a
troubled Moslem pool left by the receding wave of Islam in Europe But
the old atmosphere will have changed the glamour will have gone the
dust of formality and bureaucratic neatness will slowly settle down over
the timehonoured landmarks the Sanjak of Novi Bazar the Muersteg
Agreement the Komitadje bands the Vilayet of Adrianople all those
familiar outlandish names and things and places that we have known so
long as part and parcel of the Balkan Question will have passed away
into the cupboard of yesterdays as completely as the Hansa League and
the wars of the Guises

They were the heritage that history handed down to us spoiled and
diminished no doubt in comparison with yet earlier days that we never
knew but still something to thrill and enliven one little corner of our
Continent something to help us to conjure up in our imagination the days
when the Turk was thundering at the gates of Vienna And what shall we
have to hand down to our children Think of what their news from the
Balkans will be in the course of another ten or fifteen years Socialist
Congress at Uskub election riot at Monastir great dock strike at
Salonika visit of the YMCA to Varna Varnaon the coast of that
enchanted sea They will drive out to some suburb to tea and write home
about it as the Bexhill of the East

War is a wickedly destructive thing

Still you must admit began the Merchant But the Wanderer was not
in the mood to admit anything He rose impatiently and walked to where
the tapemachine was busy with the news from Adrianople




FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR


The Rev Wilfrid Gaspilton in one of those clerical migrations
inconsequentseeming to the lay mind had removed from the moderately
fashionable parish of St Lukes Kensingate to the immoderately rural
parish of St Chuddocks somewhere in Yondershire There were doubtless
substantial advantages connected with the move but there were certainly
some very obvious drawbacks Neither the migratory clergyman nor his
wife were able to adapt themselves naturally and comfortably to the
conditions of country life Beryl Mrs Gaspilton had always looked
indulgently on the country as a place where people of irreproachable
income and hospitable instincts cultivated tennislawns and rosegardens
and Jacobean pleasaunces wherein selected gatherings of interested week
end guests might disport themselves Mrs Gaspilton considered herself
as distinctly an interesting personality and from a limited standpoint
she was doubtless right She had indolent dark eyes and a comfortable
chin which belied the slightly plaintive inflection which she threw into
her voice at suitable intervals She was tolerably well satisfied with
the smaller advantages of life but she regretted that Fate had not seen
its way to reserve for her some of the ampler successes for which she
felt herself well qualified She would have liked to be the centre of a
literary slightly political salon where discerning satellites might
have recognised the breadth of her outlook on human affairs and the
undoubted smallness of her feet As it was Destiny had chosen for her
that she should be the wife of a rector and had now further decreed that
a country rectory should be the background to her existence She rapidly
made up her mind that her surroundings did not call for exploration Noah
had predicted the Flood but no one expected him to swim about in it
Digging in a wet garden or trudging through muddy lanes were exertions
which she did not propose to undertake As long as the garden produced
asparagus and carnations at pleasingly frequent intervals Mrs Gaspilton
was content to approve of its expense and otherwise ignore its existence
She would fold herself up so to speak in an elegant indolent little
world of her own enjoying the minor recreations of being gently rude to
the doctors wife and continuing the leisurely production of her one
literary effort _The Forbidden Horsepond_ a translation of Baptiste
Leopoys _LAbreuvoir interdit_ It was a labour which had already been
so long drawnout that it seemed probable that Baptiste Lepoy would drop
out of vogue before her translation of his temporarily famous novel was
finished However the languid prosecution of the work had invested Mrs
Gaspilton with a certain literary dignity even in Kensingate circles
and would place her on a pinnacle in St Chuddocks where hardly any one
read French and assuredly no one had heard of _LAbreuvoir interdit_

The Rectors wife might be content to turn her back complacently on the
country it was the Rectors tragedy that the country turned its back on
him With the best intention in the world and the immortal example of
Gilbert White before him the Rev Wilfrid found himself as bored and ill
at ease in his new surroundings as Charles II would have been at a modern
Wesleyan Conference The birds that hopped across his lawn hopped across
it as though it were their lawn and not his and gave him plainly to
understand that in their eyes he was infinitely less interesting than a
garden worm or the rectory cat The hedgeside and meadow flowers were
equally uninspiring the lesser celandine seemed particularly unworthy of
the attention that English poets had bestowed on it and the Rector knew
that he would be utterly miserable if left alone for a quarter of an hour
in its company With the human inhabitants of his parish he was no
better off to know them was merely to know their ailments and the
ailments were almost invariably rheumatism Some of course had other
bodily infirmities but they always had rheumatism as well The Rector
had not yet grasped the fact that in rural cottage life not to have
rheumatism is as glaring an omission as not to have been presented at
Court would be in more ambitious circles And with all this death of
local interest there was Beryl shutting herself off with her ridiculous
labours on _The Forbidden Horsepond_

I dont see why you should suppose that any one wants to read Baptiste
Lepoy in English the Reverend Wilfrid remarked to his wife one morning
finding her surrounded with her usual elegant litter of dictionaries
fountain pens and scribbling paper hardly any one bothers to read him
now in France

My dear said Beryl with an intonation of gentle weariness havent
two or three leading London publishers told me they wondered no one had
ever translated _LAbreuvoir interdit_ and begged me

Publishers always clamour for the books that no one has ever written
and turn a cold shoulder on them as soon as theyre written If St Paul
were living now they would pester him to write an Epistle to the
Esquimaux but no London publisher would dream of reading his Epistle to
the Ephesians

Is there any asparagus in the garden asked Beryl because Ive told
cook

Not anywhere in the garden snapped the Rector but theres no doubt
plenty in the asparagusbed which is the usual place for it

And he walked away into the region of fruit trees and vegetable beds to
exchange irritation for boredom It was there among the gooseberry
bushes and beneath the medlar trees that the temptation to the
perpetration of a great literary fraud came to him

Some weeks later the _BiMonthly Review_ gave to the world under the
guarantee of the Rev Wilfrid Gaspilton some fragments of Persian verse
alleged to have been unearthed and translated by a nephew who was at
present campaigning somewhere in the Tigris valley The Rev Wilfrid
possessed a host of nephews and it was of course quite possible that
one or more of them might be in military employ in Mesopotamia though no
one could call to mind any particular nephew who could have been
suspected of being a Persian scholar

The verses were attributed to one Ghurab a hunter or according to
other accounts warden of the royal fishponds who lived in some
unspecified century in the neighbourhood of Karmanshah They breathed a
spirit of comfortable eventempered satire and philosophy disclosing a
mockery that did not trouble to be bitter a joy in life that was not
passionate to the verge of being troublesome

 A Mouse that prayed for Allahs aid
 Blasphemed when no such aid befell
 A Cat who feasted on that mouse
 Thought Allah managed vastly well

 Pray not for aid to One who made
 A set of neverchanging Laws
 But in your need remember well
 He gave you speed or guileor claws

 Some laud a life of mild content
 Content may fall as well as Pride
 The Frog who hugged his lowly Ditch
 Was much disgruntled when it dried

 You are not on the Road to Hell
 You tell me with fanatic glee
 Vain boaster what shall that avail
 If Hell is on the road to thee

 A Poet praised the Evening Star
 Another praised the Parrots hue
 A Merchant praised his merchandise
 And he at least praised what he knew

It was this verse which gave the critics and commentators some clue as to
the probable date of the composition the parrot they reminded the
public was in high vogue as a type of elegance in the days of Hafiz of
Shiraz in the quatrains of Omar it makes no appearance

The next verse it was pointed out would apply to the political
conditions of the present day as strikingly as to the region and era for
which it was written

 A Sultan dreamed daylong of Peace
 The while his Rivals armies grew
 They changed his Daydreams into sleep
 The Peace methinks he never knew

Woman appeared little and wine not at all in the verse of the hunter
poet but there was at least one contribution to the lovephilosophy of
the East

 O Moonfaced Charmer and Stardrowned Eyes
 And cheeks of soft delight exhaling musk
 They tell me that thy charm will fade ah well
 The Rose itself grows hueless in the Dusk

Finally there was a recognition of the Inevitable a chill breath
blowing across the poets comfortable estimate of life

 There is a sadness in each Dawn
 A sadness that you cannot rede
 The joyous Day brings in its train
 The Feast the Loved One and the Steed

 Ah there shall come a Dawn at last
 That brings no lifestir to your ken
 A long cold Dawn without a Day
 And ye shall rede its sadness then

The verses of Ghurab came on the public at a moment when a comfortable
slightly quizzical philosophy was certain to be welcome and their
reception was enthusiastic Elderly colonels who had outlived the love
of truth wrote to the papers to say that they had been familiar with the
works of Ghurab in Afghanistan and Aden and other suitable localities a
quarter of a century ago A GhurabofKarmanshah Club sprang into
existence the members of which alluded to each other as Brother
Ghurabians on the slightest provocation And to the flood of inquiries
criticisms and requests for information which naturally poured in on
the discoverer or rather the discloser of this longhidden poet the
Rev Wilfrid made one effectual reply Military considerations forbade
any disclosures which might throw unnecessary light on his nephews
movements

After the war the Rectors position will be one of unthinkable
embarrassment but for the moment at any rate he has driven _The
Forbidden Horsepond_ out of the field

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations

have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
