HISTORY OF FRIEDRICH II OF PRUSSIA

FREDERICK THE GREAT

By Thomas Carlyle




Book XVIITHE SEVENYEARS WAR FIRST CAMPAIGN17561757




Chapter IWHAT FRIEDRICH HAD READ IN THE MENZEL DOCUMENTS

The illinformed world entirely unaware of what Friedrich had been
studying and ascertaining to his bitter sorrow for four years past
was extremely astonished at the part he took in those FrenchEnglish
troubles extremely provoked at his breaking out again into a Third
Silesian War greater than all the others and kindling all Europe in
such a way The illinformed world rang violently then and long after
with a Controversy Was it of his beginning or Not of his beginning
Controversy which may in our day be considered as settled by unanimous
mankind finished forever and can now have no interest for any
creature

Omitting that our problem is were it possible in brief compass To
set forth by what authentic traits there arenot the ambitious
audacious voracious and highly condemnable Friedrich of the
Gazetteersbut the thriceintricately situated Friedrich of Fact What
the Facts privately known to Friedrich were in what manner known and
how in a more complex crisis than had yet been Friedrich demeaned
himself upon which latter point and those cognate to it readers ought
not to be ignorant if now fallen indifferent on so many other points of
the Affair What a loudroaring loose and empty matter is this tornado
of vociferation which men call Public Opinion Tragically howling
round a man who has to stand silent the while and scan wisely under
pain of death the altogether inarticulate dumb and inexorable matter
which the gods call Fact Friedrich did read his terrible Sphinxriddle
the Gazetteer tornado did pipe and blow King Friedrich in contrast
with his Environment at that time will most likely never be portrayed
to modern men in his real proportions real aspect and attitude then and
therewhich are silently not a little heroic and even pathetic when
well seen intoand for certain he is not portrayable at present
on our side of the Sea But what hints and fractions of feature we
authentically have ought to be given with exactitude especially with
brevity and left to the ingenuous imagination of readers

The secret sources of the Third Silesian War since called SevenYears
War go back to 1745 nay we may say to the First Invasion of Silesia
in 1740 For it was in Maria Theresas incurable sorrow at loss of
Silesia and her inextinguishable hope to reconquer it that this and
all Friedrichs other Wars had their origin Twice she had signed Peace
with Friedrich and solemnly ceded Silesia to him but that too with
the Imperial Lady was by no means a finis to the business Not that
she meant to break her Treaties far from her such a thoughtin the
conscious form Though alas in the unconscious again it was always
rather near practically she reckoned to herself these Treaties would
come to be broken as Treaties do not endure forever and then at the
good moment she did purpose to be ready Silesia back to us Pragmatic
Sanction complete in every point Was not that our dear Fathers will
monition of all our Fathers and their Patriotisms and Traditionary
Heroisms and in fact the behest of gods and men Ten years ago this
notion had been cut down to apparent death in a disastrous manner for
the second time But it did not die in the least it never thinks of
dying starts always anew passionate to produce itself again as action
valid at last and lives in the Imperial Heart with a tenacity that is
strange to observe Still stranger in the envious ValetHeartin that
of Bruhl who had far less cause

The Peace of Dresden Christmas 1745 seemed to be an act of
considerable magnanimity on Friedrichs part It was at the first blush
of it incredible to Harrach the Austrian Plenipotentiary whose
embarrassed astonished bow we remember on that occasion with English
Villiers shedding pious tears But what is very remarkable withal is
a thing since discovered INFRA next Note p 276 That Harrach
magnanimous signature hardly yet dry did then straightway by order of
his Court very privately inquire of Bruhl There is Peace you see
what they call Peacebut our TREATY OF WARSAW for Partition of this
magnanimous man stands all the same does nt it To which according
to the Documents Bruhl hardly escaped from the pangs of death and
still in a very paleyellow condition had answered in effect Hah
say you so Ones hatred is eternalbut that mans iron heel Wait a
little get Russia to join in the schemeand hung back the willing
mind but the too terrified And in this way like a famishing dog in
sight of a too dangerous leg of mutton Bruhl has ever since rather
held back would not reengage at all for almost two years even on
the Czarinas engaging and then only in a cautious conditional and
hypothetic mannerthough with famine increasing day by day in sight
of the desired viands His hatred is fell but he would fain escape with
back unbroken




HOW FRIEDRICH DISCOVERED THE MYSTERY CONCERNING MENZEL AND WEINGARTEN

Friedrich has been aware of this mystery at least wide awake to it and
becoming ever more instructed for almost four years Traitor Menzel the
Saxon Kanzellistwe who have prophetically read what he had to confess
when laid hold of are aware though as yet and on to 1757 it is a
dead secret to all mortals but himself and three othershas been busy
for Prussia ever since the end of 1752 Got admittance to the Presses
sent his first Excerpt about the time of EasterFair 1753time
of Voltaires taking wing And has been at work ever since Copying
Despatches from the most secret Saxon Repositories ready always on
Excellency Mahlzahns indicating the Piece wanted and of late I should
think is busier than ever as the Saxon Mystery which is also an
Austrian and Russian one gets more light thrown into it and seems to
be fast ripening towards action of a perilous nature The first Excerpts
furnished by Menzel readers can judge how enigmatic they were These
Menzel Papers copies mainly of Petersburg or Vienna DESPATCHES to
Bruhl with Bruhls ANSWERSthe principal of which were subsequently
printed in their best arrangement and liveliest point of vision In
Friedrichs Manifestoes chiefly in MEMOIRE RAISONNE SUR LA CONDUITE DES
COURS DE VIENNE ET DE SAXE compiled from the MENZEL ORIGINALS so
soon as these were got hold of Berlin Autumn 1756 A solid and
able Paper rapidly done by one Count Herzberg who rose high in
after times Reprinted with many other Pieces and Passages in
_Gesammelte Nachrichten und Urkunden_which is a Collection of such
2 vols 113 Nos small 8vo no Place 1757 my Copy of itare by
no means a luminous set of Documents to readers at this day Think what
a study they were at Potsdam in 1753 while still in the chaotic state
fished out more or less at random as Menzel could lay hold of them
or be directed to them the enigma clearing itself only by intense
inspection and capability of seeing in the dark

It appearsif you are curious on the anecdotic part

Winterfeld was the first that got eye on this dangerous Saxon
Mystery some ExSaxon about to settle in Berlin giving hint of it
to Winterfeld who needed only a hint So soon as Winterfeld convinced
himself that there was weight in the affair he imparted it to
Friedrich Scheme of partitioning your Majesty of picking
quarrel then overwhelming and partitioning most serious scheme
AustrianRussian as well as Saxon going on steadily for years past and
very lively at this time If true Friedrich cannot but admit that this
is serious enough important thrice over to discover whether it is
trueand gives Winterfeld authority to prosecute it to the bottom in
Dresden or wherever the secret may lie Who thereupon charged Mahlzahn
the Prussian Minister at Dresden to find some proper Menzel and bestir
himself How Mahlzahn has found his Menzel and has bestirred himself
we saw Thiefkeys were made to pattern in Berlin first set did not
fit second did and stealthy Menzel gains admittance to that Chamber of
the Archives can steal thither on shoes of felt when occasion serves
and copy what you wishfor a consideration Intermittently since
about EasterFair 1753 Three persons are cognizant of it Winterfeld
Mahlzahn Friedrich three and no more Probably the abstrusest study
and the most intense going on in the world at that epoch Rotzow
_Charakteristik des Siebenjahrigen Krieges _Berlin 1802 i 23

At a very early stage of the Menzel Excerpts it became manifest that
certain synchronous Austrian Ditto would prove highly elucidative that
in fact it would be indispensable to get hold of these as well Which
also Winterfeld has managed to do A deepheaded man who has his eyes
about him and is very apt to manage what he undertakes One Weingarten
Junior a Secretary in the Austrian Embassy at Berlin Excellency
Peublas second Secretary has his acquaintanceships in Berlin Society
and for one thing as Winterfeld discovers is madly in love with
some Chambermaid or quasichambermaid let us call her Chambermaid
Daughter of the Castellan at Charlottenburg Winterfeld through the
due channels applied to this Chambermaid Get me a small secret Copy
of such and such Despatches out of your Weingarten it will be well for
you and him otherwise perhaps not well Chambermaid hope urging
or perhaps hope and fear did her best Weingarten had to yield the
required product and products as required By this Weingarten from
some date not long after Menzels first mysterious Dresden Excerpts
the necessary Austrian glosses so far as possible to Weingarten on the
indications given him have been regularly had for the two or three
years past

Weingarten first came to be seriously suspected June 1756 Weingarten
Junior let us still say for there was a Senior of unstained fidelity
June 15th Excellency Peubla pointedly demands him from Friedrich and
the Berlin Police Weingarten Junior my SECOND Secretar fugitive and
traitor hidden somewhere BERLIN 22d JUNE Every research making
for Mr Weingattenin vain hitherto _Gentlemans Magazine _xxvi
i e for 1756 p 363 Excellency Peubla is answered 24th June We
would so fain catch him if we could We have tried at Stendalnot
there tried his Motherinlaw knows nothing have forborne laying up
his poor Wife and Children and hope her Imperial Majesty will
have pity on that poor creature who is fallen so miserable
_HeldenGeschichte_ iii 713 So that Excellency Peubla had nothing
for it but to compose himself to honor the unstainable fidelity of
Weingarten Senior by a public piece of promotion which soon ensued and
let the Junior run Weingarten Junior on the first suspicion had
vanished with due promptitudewas not to be unearthed again We
perceive he has married his Charlottenburg Beauty and there are
helpless babies It seems he lived long years after in the Altmark as
a Herr von Weisshis reflections manifold but unknown Retzow i
37 What is much notabler Cogniazzo the Austrian Veteran heard
Weingartens MASTER Graf von Peubla talk of the GRAND MYSTERE soon
after and how Friedrich had heard of it not from Weingarten alone but
from GrossFurst PETER Russian HeirApparent Cogniazzo i 225

As to Menzel he did not get away Menzel as we saw lasted in free
activity till 1757 and was then put under lock and key Was not hanged
sat prisoner for twentyseven years after overgrown with hair legs
and arms chained together heavy iron bar uniting both ankles diet
breadandwaterfor the rest healthy and died not very miserable it
is said in 1784 Shocking traitors Weingarten and he

Yes a diabolical pair they sure enoughand the thing they betrayed
against their Masters was that a celestial thing Servants of the Devil
do fall out and Servants not of the Devil are fain sometimes to raise
a quarrel of that kind

The then world as we said was one loud uproar of logic on the right
reading and the wrong of those Sibylline Documents Did your King of
Prussia interpret them aright or even try it Did not he use them as a
cloak for highway robbery and swallowing of a peaceable Saxony bad man
that he surely is For Friedrichs demeanor this time again when
it came to the acting point was of eminent rapidity almost a swifter
lionspring than ever and it brought on him in the aerial or vocal
way its usual result huge clamor of rage and logic from uninformed
mankind Clamorous rage and logic which has now sunk irresuscitably
deadnothing of it much worth mentioning to modern readers scarcely
even its HIC JACET in Footnotes for the benefit of the curiousand
it is at last a thing not doubtful to anybody that Friedrich in that
matter did read aright So that now the loud uproar is reduced to one
small question with us What did he read in those Menzel Documents What
Fact lying in them was it that Friedrich had to read Here smelted down
by repeated roastings is succinct answerfor the ultimate fragment of
incombustible here as elsewhere will go into a nutshell once the
continents of DiplomatistGazetteer logic and disorderly stablelitter
threatening to heap themselves over the very stars have been faithfully
burnt away

Readers heard of a Union of Warsaw early in 1745 concluded by the
SeaPowers and the SaxonPolish and Hungarian Majesties very
harmless UNION of Warsaw public to all the worldbut with a certain
thricesecret TREATY of Warsaw between Polish and Hungarian Majesty
themselves two the SeaPowers being horrorstruck by mention of
it which had followed thereupon in an eager and wonderful manner
Thricesecret Treaty for Partitioning Friedrich and settling the
respective shares of his skin Treaty which to denote its origin we
called of Warsaw though it was not finished there shares of skin so
difficult to settle and Treaty of LEIPZIG 18th May 1745 is
its ALIAS in Booksof which Treaty as the SeaPowers had recoiled
horrorstruck there was no whisper farther to them or to the rest of
exoteric mankindthough it has been one of the busiest Entities ever
since From the Menzel Documents I know not after what circuitous
gropings and searchings Friedrich first got notice of that Treaty
Now printed in _OEuvres de Frederic_ iv 4042 figure his look on
discovering it

We said it was the remarkablest bit of sheepskin in its Century Readers
have heard too That it was proposed to Bruhl by a grateful Austria
directly on signing the Peace of Dresden Our PartitionTreaty stands
all the same does it notand in what humor Bruhl answered Hah Get
Russia to join Both these facts That there is a Treaty of Warsaw and
that this is the AustrianSaxon temper and intention towards him and
it Friedrich learned from the Menzel Documents And if the reader will
possess himself of these two facts and understand that they are of a
germinative most vital quality indestructible by the times and the
chances and have been growing and developing themselves day and night
ever since in a truly wonderful mannerthe reader knows in substance
what Menzel had to reveal

Russia was got to jointhere are methods of operating on Russia and
kindling a poor fat Czarina into strange suspicions and indignations
In May 1746 within six months of the Peace of Dresden a Treaty of
Petersburg new version of the Warsaw one was brought to parchment
Czarina and EmpressQueen signingBruhl dying to sign but not daring
How Russia has been got to join and more and more vigorously bear a
hand how Bruhls rabidities of appetite and terrors of heart have
continued ever since how Austria and RussiaBruhl aiding with
hysterical alacrity haunted by terror and at last mercifully EXCUSED
from signinghave year after year especially in this last year
1755 brought the matter nearer and nearer perfection and the Two
Imperial Majesties with Bruhl to rear wait only till they are fully
ready and the world gives opportunity to pick a quarrel with
Friedrich and overwhelm and partition him according to covenant This
wandering through endless mazes of detail is in sum what the Menzel
Documents disclose to Friedrich and us How in a space of ten years
the small seedgrain of a Treaty of Warsaw or Treaty of Petersburg
planted and nourished in that manner in the Satans Invisible World
has grown into a mighty Tree thereprophetic of Facts near at hand
which were extremely sanguinary to the Human Race for the next Seven
Years

This is the sumtotal but for Friedrichs sake and to illustrate
the situation let us take a few glances more into the then Satans
Invisible World which had become so ominously busy round Friedrich and
others The Czarina we say was got to engage 22d May 1746 there
came a Treaty of Petersburg duly valid which is that of Warsaw under a
new name and still Bruhl durst not for above a year comingnot till

459 and then only in a hypothetic halfandhalf way with fear and
trembling though with hunger unspeakable in sight of the viands A
very wretched Bruhl as seen in these Menzel Documents On poor Polish
Majesty Bruhl has played the sorcerer this long while and ridden him
as he would an enchanted quadruped in a shameful manner but how in
turn as we study Menzel is Bruhl himself hagridden hunted by his
own devils and leads such a ghastly phantasmal existence yonder in
the Valley of the Shadow of CLOTHESmere Clothes metaphorical and
literal MONTREZMOI DES VERTUS PAS DES CULOTTES Have you no virtues

agitated with hatreds of a rather infernal nature and with terrors of
a not celestial comes out on our sympathies as a dog almost
pitiablewere that possible with twelve tailors sewing for him and a
Saxony getting shoved over the precipices by him

A famishing dog in the most singular situation What he dare do he
does and with such a will But there is almost only one thing safe to
him that of egging on the Czarina against Friedrich of coining lies to
kindle Czarish Majesty of wafting on every wind rumors to that end and
continually besieging with them the empty Czarish mind Bruhl has many
Conduits the Sieur de Funck the Sieur Gross plenty of Legationary
Sieurs and Conduitswhich issue from all quarters on Petersburg and
which find there a Reservoir and due Russian SERVICEPIPES prepared
for themand Bruhl is busy Commerce of Dantzig to be ruined

Embden Poland is to be stirred uphas not your Czarish Majesty
heard of his intrigues there Courland which is almost become your
Majestyscunningly snatched by your Majestys address like a valuable
moribund whale adrift among the shallowsthis bad man will have it
out to sea again with the harpoons in it fairly afloat amid the Polish
Anarchies again These are but specimens of Bruhl Or we can give such
in Bruhls own words if the reader had rather Here are Two which have
the advantage of brevity

1 The Sieur de Funck Saxon Minister at Petersburg wrote to Count
Bruhl 9th July 1755 says an inexorable Record That the Sieur Gross
now Minister of Russia at Dresden who vanished out of Berlin like an
angry skyrocket some years ago would do a good service to the Common
Cause if he wrote to his Court That the King of Prussia had found a
channel in Courland by which he learned all the secrets of the Russian
Court and Sieur Funck added that it was expected good use could be
made of such a story with her Czarish MajestyTo which Count Bruhl
replies 23d July That he has instructed the Sieur Gross who will not
fail to act in consequence

2 Sieur Prasse same Funcks Secretary of Legation at Petersburg
writes to Count Bruhl 12th April 1756

I am bidden signify to your Excellency that it is greatly wished
in order to favor certain views you would have the goodness to cause
arrive in Petersburg by different channels the following intelligence
That the King of Prussia on pretext of Commerce is sending officers
and engineers into the Ukraine to reconnoitre the Country and excite a
rebellion there And this advice be pleased to observe is not to come
direct from the Saxon Court nor by the Envoy Gross but by some third
partyto the end there may be no concert noticedas they LON the
servicepipes and managing Excellencies Russian and Austrian have
given the same commission to other Ministers so that the news shall
come from more places than one

They the said managing Excellencies have also required me to write to
the Baron de Sack our Saxon Minister in Sweden upon it which I will
not fail to do and they assured me that our Courts advantage was
not less concerned in it than that of their own adding these words
comfortable to ones soul The King of Prussia in 1745 gave Saxony
a blow which it will feel for fifty years but we will give him one
which he will feel for a hundred

To which beautiful suggestion Excellency Bruhl answers 2d June 1756
As to the Secret Commission of conveying to Petersburg by concealed
channels Intelligence of Prussian machinations in the Ukraine we are
still busy finding out a right channel and they LON the managing
Excellencies shall very soon one way or the other see the effect of
my personal inclination to second what is so good an intention though
a little artful UN PEU ARTIFICIEUSEUN PEU nothing to speak of
MEMOIRE RAISONNE in _ Gesammelte Nachrichten _ i 424425 and ib

Fancy a poor fat Czarina of many appetites of little judgment
continually beaten upon in this manner by these SaxonAustrian artists
and their Russian servicepipes Bombarded with cunningly devised
fabrications every wind freighted for her with phantasmal rumors no
ray of direct daylight visiting the poor Sovereign Woman who is lazy
not malignant if she could avoid it mainly a mass of esurient oil
with alkali on the back of alkali poured in at this rate for ten years
past till by pouring and by stirring they get her to the state of
SOAP and froth Is it so wonderful that she does by degrees rise into
eminent suspicion anger fear violence and vehemence against her bad
neighbor One at last begins to conceive those insane whirls continual
mad suspicions mad procedures which have given Friedrich such
vexation surprise and provocation in the years past

Friedrich is always specially eager to avoid illwill from Russia but
it has come in spite of all he could do and try And these procedures
of the Czarish Majesty have been so capricious unintelligible
perverse and his feeling is often enough irritation temporary
indignationwhich we know makes Verses withal I can nowhere learn
from those Prussian imbroglios of Books what the Friedrich Sayings
or Satirical Verses properly were Retzow speaks of a PRODUKT one
at least known in interior Circles Retzow i 34 PRODUKT which
decidedly requires publication beyond anything Friedrich ever
wrotethough one can do without it too and invoke Fancy in defect of
Print The sharpness of Friedrichs tongue we know and the diligence of
birds of the air To all her other griefs against the bad man this has
given the finish in the tender Czarish bosomand like an envenomed
drop has set the saponaceous oils already dosed with alkali and
well in solution foaming deliriously over the brim in neverimagined
deluges of a hatred that is unappeasablevery costly to Friedrich and
mankind Rising ever higher year by year and now risen to what height
judge by the following

AT PETERSBURG 14th15th MAY 1753 There was Meeting of the Russian
Senate with deliberation held for these two days and for issue this
conclusion come to

That it should be and hereby is settled as a fundamental maxim of the
Russia Empire Not only to oppose any farther aggrandizement of the
King of Prussia but to seize the first convenient opportunity for
overwhelming ECRASER by superior force the House of Brandenburg

Bruhl and kindred parties especially from Bruhlwho however dare
not yet bite except hypothetically such his terrors and tremors Or
look again same Senate

AT PETERSBURG OCTOBER 1755 To which Fundamental Maxim articulately
fixed ever since those Maydays of 1753 the august Russian Sanhedrim
deliberating farther in October 1755 adds this remarkable extension

That it is our resolution to attack the King of Prussia without farther
discussion whensoever the said King shall attack any Ally of Russias
or shall himself be attacked by any of them Hailed by Bruhl as
natural with his liveliest approval A glorious Deliberation that
indeed writes he It clears the way of action for Russias Allies in
this matter and for us too though nobody can blame us if we proceed
with the extremest cautionand rather wait till the Bear is nearly
killed MEMOIRE RAISONNE in _Gesammelte Nachrichten_  i 422

Many marvels Friedrich had deciphered out of this WeingartenMenzel
Apocalypse of Satans Invisible World and one often fancies Friedrichs
tone of mind in his intense inspecting of that fateful continent
of darkness and his labyrinthic stepping by degrees to the oracular
points which have a light in them when flung open But in respect of
practical interest this of October 1755 which would get to Potsdam
probably in few weeks after must have surpassed all the others Marvels
many one after the other For example or in recapitulation a Treaty
of Warsaw or Leipzig to partition him 18th May 1745 Treaty of
Petersburg 22d May 1746 new form of Warsaw Treaty with Czarina
superadded tremulous QuasiAccession thereto of his Polish Majesty
most tremulous hypothetic QuasiAccession YesANDNo 15th August

most tremulous hypothetic QuasiAccession YesANDNo 15th August
1747 and often afterwards first Deliberation of the Russian Senate
15th May 1753 c c no doubt left long since of the constant
disposition preparation and fixed intention to partition him But
here in this last indication by the Russian Senatewhich kindles into
dismal evidence so many other enigmatic tokensthere has an ulterior
oracular point disclosed itself to Friedrich in vaguer condition but
not less indubitable and much more perilous namely That now at last
end of 1755 the Two Imperial Majesties very eager both consider
that the time is come And areas Friedrich looks abroad on the
AustrianRussian marchings of troops campings and unusual military
symptoms and combinationsvisibly preparing to that end

They have agreed to attack me next Year 1756 if they can and next
again 1757 without IF so Friedrich putting written word and public
occurrence together gradually reads and so all readers will see
the fact wasthough Imperial Majesty at Schonbrunn as we shall find
strove to deny it when applied to and scouted as mere fiction
and imagination the notion of such an Agreement Which I infer
therefore NOT to have existed in parchment not in parchment but
only in reality and as a mutual Bond registered inshall we say in
Heaven as some are wontregistered perhaps in TWO Places very
separate indeed No truer Agreement ever did existthough a devout
Imperial Majesty denies it who would shudder at the lie direct

Poor Imperial Majesty who can tell her troubles and straits in this
abstruse time Heaven itself ordering her to get back the Silesia of her
Fathers if she couldyet Heaven always looking dubious surely upon
this method of doing it By solemn Public Treaties signed in sight
of all mankind and contrariwise in the very same moments by Secret
Treaties of a fell nature concocted underground to destroy the life
of these Imperial Majesty flatters herself it may be fair Treaty of
Dresden Treaty of AixlaChapelle Treaties wrung from me by force the
tyrannic SeaPowers screwing us Kaunitz can tell A consummate Kaunitz
who has provided remedies Treaties do get broken Besides I will
not go to War unless HE the Bad One of Prussia doAlas your noble
Majesty plain it at least is your love of Silesia is very strong And
consummate Kaunitz and it have led you into strange predicaments The
Pompadour for instance who was it that answered JE NE LA CONNAIS
PAS I dont know her How gladly would the Imperial Maria Theresa
soul of Propriety have made that answer But she did not she had to
answer differently For Kaunitz was imperative A kind little Note to
the Pompadour one and then another and another it is indispensable
your Imperial Majesty And Imperial Majesty always had to do it And
there exist in writing at this hour various flattering little Notes
from Imperial Majesty to that Address which begin MA COUSINE
PRINCESSE ET COUSINE say many witnesses nay MADAME MA TRES CHERE

to have been printed before this or given at least to the Museums
My Cousin Princess and Cousin Madame my dearest Sister Oh
high Imperial Soul with what strange bedfellows does Misery of various
kinds bring us acquainted

Friedrich was blamably imprudent in regard to Pompadour thinks Valori
A little complaisance might havewhat might it not have done But
his Prussian Majesty would not And while the Ministers of all the
other Powers allied with France went assiduously to pay their court
to Madame the Baron von Knyphausen alone by his Masters order never
once went Dont JE NE LA CONNAIS PASwhile the EmpressQueen
was writing her the most flattering letters The Prince of Prussia
Kings eldest Brother wished ardently to obtain her Portrait and had
applied to me for it as had Prince Henri to my Predecessor The King
who has such gallant and seductive ways when he likes could certainly
have reconciled this celebrated Ladya highly important Improper
Female to him and others Valori i 320

Yes but he quite declined not counting the costs Costs may be
immediate profits are remoteremote but sure Costs did indeed prove
considerable perhaps far beyond his expectation though I flatter
myself they never awoke much remorse in him on that score

Friedrichs Enigma towards the end of 1755 and onwards is becoming
frightfully stringent and the solution What practically will be the
wise course for me does not lessen in abstruse intricacy but the
reverse as it grows more pressing A very stormy and dubious Future
truly Two circumstances in it will be highly determinative one of
them evident to Friedrich the other unknown to him and to all mortals
except two or three FIRST

That there will be an EnglishFrench War straightway and that as
usual the French weaker at sea will probably attack Hanover
that is to say bring the War home to ones own door and ripen
into fulfilment those AustrianRussian Plots This is the evident
circumstance fast coming on visible to Friedrich and to everybody
But that in such event Austria will join not with England but with
France this is a SECOND circumstance guessable by nobody known
only to Kaunitz and a select one or two but which also will greatly
complicate Friedrichs position and render his Enigma indeed
astonishingly intricate as well as stringent for solution




Chapter IIENGLISH DIPLOMACIES ABROAD IN PROSPECT OF A FRENCH WAR

Britannic Majesty I know not at what date but before the launching of
that poor Braddock thunderbolt much more after the tragic explosion it
made had felt that French War was nearly inevitable and also that the
French method would be as heretofore to attack Hanover and wound
him in that tender part There goes on accordingly a lively Foreign
Diplomatizing on his Majestys part at presentin defect almost
total of Domestic Preparation military and otherMajesty and
Ministers expecting salvation from abroad as usual Military
preparation does lag at a shameful rate but on the other hand
there is a great deal of pondering really industrious considering and
contriving about Foreign Allies and their subsidies and engagements
That step for example the questionable Seizure of the French Ships
WITHOUT Declaration of War was a contrivance by diplomatic Heads of
bad quality Seize their ships said some bad Head after meditating
put their ships in SEQUESTRATION till they do us justice If they
wont and go to Warthen THEY are the Aggressors not we and our
Allies have to send their auxiliary quotas as per contract So the
Ships were seized held in sequestration till many of the cargoes
being perishable goods some even fish rotted Smolletts _History
of England _c c And in return as will be seen not one auxiliary
came to hand so that the diplomatic Head had his rotted cargoes and
much public obloquy for his pains Not a fortunate stroke of business
that

Britannic Majesty on applying at Vienna through Keith Sir or Mr
Robert Keith the FIRST Excellency of that name for there are two a
father and a son both Vienna Excellencies was astonished to learn
That in such event of an Aggression even on Hanover there was no
cooperation to be looked for here Altogether cold on that subject her
Imperial Majesty seems regardless of Excellency Keiths remonstrances
and urgencies and in the end is flatly negatory Cannot do it your
Excellency times so perilous bad King of Prussia so minatorynot
to mention SOTTO VOCE that we have turned on our axis and the wind
thanks to Kaunitz no longer hits us on the same cheek as formerly

Cannot Will not Britannic Majesty may well stare wideeyed
remembering such gigantic Subsidizings and Alcides Labors Dettingens
Fontenoys on the percontra side But so stands the fact No help from
an ungrateful Viennaquick then seek elsewhere And Hanbury and the
Continental British Excellencies have to bestir themselves as they never
did Especially Hanbury who is directed upon Russiawhom alone of
these Excellencies it is worth while to follow for a moment Russia
on fair subsidy yielded us a 35000 last War willingly granted most
useful though we had no fighting out of them mere terror of them being
enough beyond all things let Hanbury do his best in Russia

Hanbury cheerfully confident provides himself with the requisites
store of bribemoney as the chiefat Warsaw withal he picks up one
Poniatowski airy sentimental coxcomb rather of dissolute habits
handsomest and windiest of young Polacks Good for a Lover to the
GrandDuchess this one thinks Hanbury Which proved true and had its
uses for HanburyGrandDuchess and GrandDuke Catherine and Peter
whom we saw wedded twelve years ago HeirsApparent of this Russian
Chaos being an abstrusely situated pair of Spouses well capable of
something political in private ways in such a scene of affairs and
Catherine who is an extremely clever creature being out of a lover
just now A fine scene for the Diplomatist this Russia at present
Nowhere in the world can you do so much with bribery quite a standing
item and financial necessaryoflife to Officials of the highest rank
there as Hanbury well knows His Letters in Raumer PASSIM That
of Poniatowski proved otherwise too a notable stroke of Hanburys and
shot the poor Polish Coxcomb aloft into tragic altitudes on the sudden
as we all know

Hanburys immense dexterities and incessant labors at Petersburg shall
lie hidden in the sloppails it is enough to say his guineas his
dexterities and auxiliary Poniatowskis did prevail and he triumphantly
signed his Treaty Petersburg 30th September SubsidyTreaty for
55000 men 15000 of them cavalry not to speak of 40 to 50 galleys
and the like to attack whomsoever Britannic Majesty bids annual cost

In _Adelung_ vii 609 And what is more and what our readers are to
mark the 55000 begin on the instant to assemblealong the Livonian
Frontier or Lithuanian looking direct into Preussen Diligently
rendezvousing there 55000 of them nay gradually 70000 no stinginess
in the Czarina to her Ally of England A most triumphant thing thinks
Hanbury Could another of you have done it Signed ready for ratifying
30th September 1755 bad Braddock news not hinderingand before it
is ratified this also let readers mark the actual Troops getting on
march

Hanburys masterpiece surely a glorious triumph in the circumstances
and a difficult thinks Hanbury Had Hanbury seen the inside of the
cards as readers have he would not have thought it so triumphant For
years pastespecially since that Fundamental maxim May 14th15th
1753 which we heard ofthe Czarinas longings had been fixed And
here nowscattering money from both hands of it and wooing us with
diplomatic finessingsis the Fulfilment come Opportunity upon
Preussen behold it here

The Russian Senate again holds deliberation declares on the heel of
this Hanbury Treaty in October 1755 what we read above That its
AntiPrussian intentions aretruculent indeed And it is the common
talk in Petersburg society through Winter what a dose the ambitious
King of Prussia has got brewed for him MEMOIRE RAISONNE in

THE TRIUMPHANT HANBURY TREATY BECOMES ITSELF NOTHING OR LESSBUT
PRODUCES A FRIEDRICH TREATY FOLLOWED BY RESULTS WHICH SURPRISE
EVERYBODY

King Friedrichs outlooks on this consummation may well seem to him
critical The sore longing of an infuriated Czarina is now let loose
and in a condition to fulfil itself To Friedrich these Petersburg news
are no secret nor to him are the Petersburg private intentions a thing
that can be doubted Apart from the MenzelWeingarten revelations as
we noticed once it appears the GrandDuke Peter a great admirer
of Friedrich poor confused soul had himself thricesecretly warned
Friedrich That the mysterious Combination Russia in the van would
attack him next Springnot Weingarten that betrayed our GRAND
MYSTERE from first hand that was done said Excellency Peubla
on quitting Berlin not long after Cogniazzo _Gestandnisse eines
OEsterreichischen Veterans _as cited above i 225 September 16th
1756 Peubla left Berlin Rodenbeck i 298three months after
Weingartens disappearance The Grand Mystery is not uncertain to
Friedrich and it may well be very formidablecoupled with those
Braddock explosions Seizures of French ships and EnglishFrench War
imminent and likely to become a general European one which are the
closing prospects of 1755 The French King he reckons not to be well
disposed to him their old Treaty of twelve years since 1744 is just
about running out Not friendly the French King owing to little rubs
that have been still less the Pompadourthough who could guess how
implacable she was at not being known NE LA CONNAIS PAS At Vienna
he is well aware the humor towards him is mere cannibalism in refined
forms But most perilous of all most immediately perilous is the
implacable Czarina set afloat upon English guineas

With a hope as is credibly surmised that the English might soothe or
muzzle this implacable Czarina Friedrich directly after Hanburys feat
in Petersburg applied at London with an Offer which was very tempting
there Suppose your Britannic Majesty would make with me an express
NEUTRALITY CONVENTION mutual Covenant to keep the German Reich
entirely free of this War now threatening to break out To attack
jointly and sweep home again with vigor any and every Armed NonGerman
setting foot on the German soil An offer most welcome to the Heads of
Opposition the Pitts and others of that Country who wish dear Hanover
safe enough safe in DavyJoness locker if that would do but are
tired of subsidizing and fighting and tumulting all the world over
for that high end So that Friedrichs Proposal is grasped at and after
a little manipulation the thing is actually concluded

By no means much manipulation both parties being willing There was
uncommonly rapid surgery of any little difficulties and discrepancies
rapid closure instant salutary stitching together of that long
unhealable Privateer Controversy as the main item 20000 pounds
allowed to Prussia for Prussian damages and to England from the other
side the remainder of Silesiau Debt painfully outstanding for two
or three years back is to be paid off at onceand in this way
such NEUTRALITY CONVENTION OF PRUSSIA WITH ENGLAND comes forth as a
Practical Fact upon mankind Done at Westminster 16th January 1756
The steppingstone as it proved to a closer Treaty of the same date
next Year of which we shall hear a great deal The steppingstone
in fact to many large thingsand to the ruin of our late
RussianSubsidy Treaty Hanburys masterpiece for one small thing
That is a Treaty signed sure enough answer they of St Jamess and
we will be handsome about it to her Czarish Majesty but as to RATIFYING
it in its present formof course never

What a clap of thunder to Excellency Hanbury his masterpiece found
suddenly a superfluity an incommodity The Orthodox English course now
is No foreign soldiers at all to be allowed in Germany and there
are the 55000 tramping on with such alacrity We cannot ratify that
Treaty Excellency Hanbury writes the Majestys Ministry in a tone
not of gratitude you must turn it some other way A terrible blow to
Hanbury who had been expecting gratitude without end And now try how
he might there was no turning it another way this privately and
this only being the Czarinas own way A Czarina obstinate to a degree
would not consent even when they made her the liberal offer Keep your
55000 at home dont attack the King of Prussia with them you shall
have your Subsidy all the same No I wont answered sheto
Hanburys amazement Hanbury had not read the WeingartenMenzel
Documentswhat double double of toil and trouble might Hanbury have
saved himself and others could he have read them

Hanbury could not still less could the Majestys Ministry surmise the
Czarinas secret at all now or for a good while coming And in fact
poor Hanbury busy as a Diplomatic bee never did more good in Russia
or out of it By direction of the Majestys Ministry Hanbury still
tried industriously cash in both hands tried various things Assuage
the Czarinas mind reconcile her to King Friedrichall in vain
Unite Austria Russia and England cant you thenin a Treaty
against the Designs of France how very vain Then at a later stage
Get us the Czarina to mediate between Prussia and Austria so
very possible to sleek them down into peace thought Majestys
Ministryand unwearied Hanbury cunning eloquence on his lips and
money in both hands tries again and ever again for many months And
in the way of making ropes from sand it must be owned there never was
such twisting and untwisting as that appointed Hanbury Who in fact
broke his heart by itand died mad by his own hand before long
Hanburys Life in _Works _vol iii gives sad account Poor soul
after allHere are some Russian Notices from him and he has many
curious not pertinent here which are still worth gleaning

Elizabeth CATIN DU NORD age now fortyfive is bad She is affected
with spitting of blood shortness of breath constant coughing swelled
legs and water on the chest yet she danced a minuet with me lucky
Hanbury There is great fermentation at Court Peter GrandDuke Peter
does not conceal his enmity to the Schuwalofs paramours of CATIN
old and new Catherine GrandDuchess who at length has an Heir
unbeautiful Czar Paul that will be and miscarriages not a few is
on good terms with Bestuchef corruptiblest brute of a Chancellor ever
known friend to England by Englands giving him 10000 pounds and the
like trifles pretty frequently Friedrichs enemy chiefly from defect
of that operationshe is on good terms with Bestuchef I think it
my duty to inform the King great George who will draw his prognostics
from it of my observations upon her which I can the better do as I
often have conversations with her for hours together as at supper my
rank places me always next to her twicelucky Hanbury

Since her coming to this Country she has by every method in her
power endeavored to gain the affections of the Nation she applied
herself with diligence to study their language and speaks it at
present as the Russians tell me in the greatest perfection She has
also succeeded in her other aim for she is esteemed and beloved here
in a high degree Her person is very advantageous and her manners very
captivating She has great knowledge of this Empire and makes it her
only study She has parts and GreatChancellor brute Bestuchef tells
me that nobody has more steadiness and resolution She has of late
openly declared herself to me in respect of the King of Prussiahates
him a good deal natural and formidable enemy of Russia heart
certainly the worst in the world and so on but will see better by and
by having eyes of her ownshe never mentions the King of England but
with the utmost respect and highest regard is thoroughly sensible of
the utility of the union between England and Russia always calls his
Majesty the Empresss best and greatest Ally so much of nourishment in
him withal as in a certain webfooted Chief of Birds reckoned chief by
some and hopes he will also give his friendship and protection to the
GrandDuke and herselfAs for the GrandDuke he is weak and violent
but his confidence in the GrandDuchess is so great that sometimes he
tells people that though he does not understand things himself his

the sad subjectmatter of Excellency Hanburys Problems and Futilities
in Russia and elsewhere let us save this other Fraction by a very
different hand and close that Hanbury scene

Friedrich himself was so dangerous says the Constitutional Historian
once Friedrich in alliance with France how easy for him to catch
Hanover by the throat at a weeks notice throw a deathnoose round the
throat of poor Hanover and hand the same to France for tightening
at discretion Poor Hanover indeed she reaps little profit from her
English honors what has she had to do with these Transatlantic Colonies
of England An unfortunate Country if the English would but think
liable to be strangled at any time for Englands quarrels the
Achillesheel to invulnerable England a sad function for Hanover
if it be a proud one and amazingly lucrative to some Hanoverians The
Country is very dear to his Britannic Majesty in one sense very dear to
Britain in another Nay Germany itself through Hanover is to be torn
up by War for Transatlantic interestsout of which she does not even
get good Virginia tobacco but grows bad of her own No more concern
than the Ring of Saturn with these oversea quarrels and can through
Hanover be torn to pieces by War about them Such honor to give a King
to the British Nation in a strait for one and such profit coming of
itwe hope all sides are grateful for the blessings received




THERE HAS BEEN A COUNTERTREATY GOING ON AT VERSAILLES IN THE INTERIM
WHICH HEREUPON STARTS OUT AND TUMBLES THE WHOLLY ASTONISHED EUROPEAN
DIPLOMACIES HEELSOVERHEAD

To expectant mankind especially to Vienna and Versailles this
BritannicPrussian Treaty was a great surprise And indeed it proved the
signal of a general System of New Treaties all round The first
signal in factthough by no means the first causeof a total
circumgyration summerset or tumble heelsoverhead in the Political
relations of Europe altogether which ensued thereupon miraculous
almost as the Earthquake at Lisbon to the Gazetteer and Diplomatic
mind and incomprehensible for long years after First signal we say by
no means that it was the first cause or indeed that it was a cause at
allthe thing being determined elsewhere long before ever since 1753
when Kaunitz left it ready waiting only its time

Kaiser Franz they say when probably during those Keith urgencies
the joining with France and turning against poor Britannic Majesty
was proposed in Council at Vienna opened his usually silent lips and
opined with emphasis against such a course no Kaunitz or creature able
to persuade Kaiser Franz that good would come of itthough finding
Sovereign Lady and everybody against him he held his peace again And
returned to his private banking operations which were more extensive
than ever from the new troubles rising Lent the EmpressQueen always
on solid securities says Friedrich large sums from time to time in
those Wars dealt in Commissariat stores to right and left we ourselves
had most of our meal from him this year _OEuvres de Frederic_ iv
8 Kaiser Franz was and continued of the old way of thinking but
consummate Kaunitz and the High Ladys fixed passion for her Schlesien
had changed everybody else The ulterior facts are as follows
abbreviated to the utmost

September 22d 1755 a few days before Hanburys Subsidyfeat at
Petersburg which took such a whirl for Hanbury there had met for the
first time at Versailles more especially at Babiole PleasureHouse
of the Pompadour a most Select Committee of Three Persons Graf von
Stahremberg Austrian Ambassador Pompadour herself and a certain
infinitely elegant Count and Reverence de Bernis beautiful
ClericoMundane Gentleman without right Benefice hitherto but much
in esteem with the Pompadourfor deepest practical consideration
in regard to closure of a FrenchAustrian Alliance Reverend Count
subsequently Cardinal de Bernis has sense in Diplomacy has his
experiences in Secular Diplomatic matters a softgoing cautious man
not yet official but tending that way whom the Pompadour has brought
with her as henchman or unghostly counsellor in this intricate
Adventure

Stahremberg instructed from home has no hesitation nor has Pompadour
herself remembering that insolent JE NE LA CONNAIS PAS and the
percontra MA COUSINE PRINCESSE ET SOEURbut Bernis I suppose
looks into the practical difficulties which are probably very
considerable to the Official French eye in the present state of Europe
and of the public mind From September 22d or autumnal equinox 1755
onward to this BritannicPrussian phenomenon of January 1756
the Pompadour Conclave has been sittingdifficulties no doubt
considerable I will give only the dates having myself no interest in
such a Committee at Babiole but the dates sufficiently betoken that
there were intricacies conflicts between the new and the old Hitherto
the axiom always was Prussia the Adjunct and Satellite of France now
to be entirely reversed you say

JULY 1755 that is two months before this Babiole Committee met a Duc
de Nivernois respectable intelligent dilettante French Nobleman
had been named as Ambassador to Friedrich Go you respectable wise
Nivernois Nobleman of Letters so called try and retain Friedrich for
us as usual And now on meeting of the Babiole Committee Nivernois
does not go lingers saddled and bridled till the very end of the
Year arrives in Berlin January 12th 1756 Has his First
Audience January 14th a man highly amiable to Friedrich but with
proposalswonderful indeed

The French this good while back are in no doubt about War with
England a right hearty War and have always expected to retain Prussia
as formerlythough rather on singular terms Some time ago for
instance M de Rouille WarMinister requested Knyphausen Prussian
Envoy at Paris Suggest to your Kings Majesty what plunder there is at
Hanover Perfectly at liberty to keep it all if he will plunder Hanover
for us _OEuvres de Frederic_ iv 29 Pleasant message to the proud
King who answered with the due brevity to the purport Silence
Sirwith didactic effects on the surprised Rouille Who now mends his
proposal though again in a remarkable way Instructs Nivernois namely
To offer King Friedrich the Island of Tobago if he will renew Treaty
and take arms for us Island of Tobago a deserted litigated but
pretty Island were it ever ours will not that entice this King
intent on Commerce Friedrich who likes Nivernois and his polite ways
answers quizzingly Island of Tobago Island of Barataria your Lordship
must be meaning Island of which I cannot be the Sancho Panza Ib
31 And Nivernois found he must not mention Tobago again

For the rest Friedrich made no secret of his English Treaty showed it
with all frankness to Nivernois in all points Is there can the most
captious allege that there is anything against France in it My one
wish and aim that of Peace for myself judge Nivernois stayed till
March but seems to have had of definite only Tobago and good words
so that nothing farther came of him and there was no Renewal of
Treaty then or after Thus in his third month March 1756 practical
Nivernois was recalled without resultinstead of whom fat Valori was
sent privately intending to do nothing but observe in Berlin From
all which we infer that the Babiole Committee now saw land and that
Bernis himself had decided in the affirmative Austria not Prussia
yes Madame To the joy of Madame and everybody For it is incredible
say all witnesses what indignation broke out in Paris when Friedrich
made this new defection so they termed it revolt from his Liege Lord
who had been so exemplary to him on former occasions and would not
bite at Tobago when offered So that the Babiole Committee went on
henceforth with flowing sea and by Mayday 1st MAY 1756 brought
out its FrenchAustrian Treaty in a completed state To stand by one
another like Castor and Pollux in a manner 24000 reciprocally
to be ready on demand nay I think something of subsidies withalTO
Austria of course But the particulars are not worth giving the
Performance thanks to a zealous Pompadour having quite outrun the
Stipulation and left it practically out of sight when the push came
Our Constitutional Historian may shadow the rest

France and England going to War in these sad circumstances and France
and Austria being privately prepared by Kaunitz and others to swear
everlasting friendship on the occasion instead of everlasting enmity
as heretofore unexpected changes miraculous to the Gazetteers became
inevitablenothing less in short than explosion or topsyturvying
of the old DiplomaticPolitical Scheme of Europe Old dance of
the Constellations flung heelsoverhead on the sudden and much
pirouetting jigging setting before they could change partners and
continue their august dance again whether in War or Peace No end to
the industrious wonder of the Gazetteer mind to the dark difficulties
of the Diplomatic What bafflings agonistic shufflings impotent
gazings into the dark what seductive fiddling and being fiddled to
A most sad function of Humanity if sometimes an inevitable one which
ought surely at all times to be got over as briefly as possible To be
written of especially with a maximum of brevity human nature being
justly impatient of talk about it beyond the strictly needful

Most true it is and was most miraculous though now quite forgotten
again Political Europe had to make a complete whirlround on that
occasion And not in a day and merely saying to itself Let me do
summerset as idle readers supposebut with long months of agonistic
shuffle and struggle in all places and such Diplomatic fiddling and
being fiddled to as seldom was before Of which these two instances
the Bernis and the Hanbury are to serve as specimen two and no more
a universe of extinct fiddling compressed into two nutshells if readers
have an ear




Chapter IIIFRENCHENGLISH WAR BREAKS OUT

The French in reality a good deal astonished at the PrussianBritannic
Treaty affected to take it easy Treaty for Neutrality of Germany
said they Very good indeed Perhaps there are places nearer us where
our troops can be employed to more advantage Their Declaration on
it Adelung vii 613hinting vocally as henceforth their silent
procedures their diligence in the dockyards moving of troops coastward
and the like still more clearly did That an Invasion of England itself
was the thing next to be expected

England and France are by this time alike fiercely determined on War
but their states of preparation are very different The French have
Warships again not to mention Armies which they always have some
skilful Admirals withalLa Gallisonniere our old Canada friend is
one very busy at presentand mean to try seriously the Question of
SeaSupremacy once more If an Invasion did chance to land the state
of England would be found handy beyond hope How many fighting regiments
England has I need not inquire nor with what strategic virtue they
would go to workenough to mention the singular fact recently true
and still I perceive too like the truth That of all their regiments
only Three are in this Country or have Colonels even nominated
Incredible but certain And the interesting point is his Grace of
Newcastle dare not have Colonels still less higher Officers nominated
because Royal Highness of Cumberland would have the naming of them and
they would be enemies to his Grace Walpole _George the Second _ii
19 date March 25th 1755 and how long after is not said but see
Pitts Speeches ib all through 1756 and farther In such posture
stands the Envy of surrounding Nations at this moment

Hire Hessians cry they hire Hanoverians if France land on us
we are undoneand continue their Parliamentary Eloquences in a most
distressful manner Apply to the Dutch at any rate for their 6000
as per Treaty cries everybody Which is done But the Dutch piteously
wring their hands Dare not your Majesty how dare we for France
and our neglected Barrier Oh generous Majesty excuse usand the
generous Majesty has to do it and leave the Dutch in peace this time
Hessians Hanoverians after eloquence enough are at last got sent for
to guard us against this terrible Invasion about 10000 of each kind
and do landthe native populations very sulky on them We wont
billet you not we build huts and be with much Parliamentary and
Newspaper Commentary going on of a distressful nature Saturday 15th

Walpole SAEPIUS and the fellow not to be tried by us for it which
enrages the constitutional heart Alas my heavyladen constitutional
heart but what can we do These drilled louts will guard us should
this terrible Invasion land And indeed about three weeks BEFORE these
louts arrived the terrible Invasion had declared itself to have
been altogether a feint and had lifted anchor quite in the opposite
direction on an errand we shall hear of soon

About the same date I observe the first regiment of Footguards
practising the Prussian drillexercise in Hyde Park and hope his Grace
of Newcastle and the Hero of Culloden immortal Hero and aiming high in
Politics at this time will at least have fallen upon some method of
getting Colonels nominated But the wideweltering chaos of platitudes
agitated by hysterical imbecilities regulating England in this great
crisis fills the constitutional mind with sorrow and indeed is
definable once more as amazing England is a stubborn Country but it
was not by procedures of the CumberlandNewcastle kind that England
and her Colonies and SeaandLand Kingdoms was built together nor by
these except miracle intervene that she can stand long against stress
Looking at the dismal matter from this distance there is visible to me
in the foggy heart of it one lucent element and pretty much one only
the individual named William Pitt as I have read him if by miracle
that royal soul could even for a time get to something of Kingship
there Courage miracles do happen let us hopeThis is whitherward
the grand Invasion had gone

TOULON 10th APRIL 1756 La Gallisonniere our old Canadian friend a
crooked little man of great faculty who has been busy in the dockyards
lately weighs anchor from Toulon 12 sail of the line 5 frigates and
above 100 transportships with the grand InvasionofEngland Armament
on board 16000 picked troops complete in all points Marechal Duc de
Richelieu commanding Adelung viii 70 Weighs anchor and singular

would have been in such excellent time but direct for Minorca as the
surer thing Will seize Minorca a socalled inexpugnable Possession
of the EnglishKey of their Mediterranean Supremaciesreally
inexpugnable enough but which lies in the usual dilapidated state
though by chance with a courageous old Governor in it who will not
surrender quite at once

APRIL 18th La Gallisonniere disembarks his Richelieu with a Sixteen
Thousand unopposed at PortMahon or Fort St Philip in Minorca who
instantly commences Siege there To the astonishment of England and
his Grace of Newcastle who except old Governor Blakeney much in
dilapidation wooden platforms rotten batteries out of repair and
so on have nothing ready for Richelieu in that quarter The story of
Minorca and the furious humors and tragic consummations that arose on
it being still well known we will give the dates only

FORT ST PHILIP APRIL 18thMAY 20th For a month Richelieu skilful in
tickling the French troops has been besieging in a high and grandiose
way La Gallisonniere vigilantly cruising old Blakeney in spite of
the rotten platforms vigorously holding out whenMay 19th La
Gallisonniere descries an English fleet in the distance indisputably
an English fleet and clears his decks for a serious Affair just coming

old seaworthy Byng who once blew out a minatory Spanish Fleet and
an absurd Flame of War in the Straits of Messina and was made Lord

does not in the least beat him to the right degreeand sheers off
in the nighttime straight for Gibraltar again To La Gallisonnieres
surprise it is said no doubt to old Blakeney and his poor Garrisons
left so to their rotten platforms and their own shifts

Blakeney and Garrison stood to their guns in a manful manner for above
a month longer day after day week after week looking over the horizon
for some Byng or some relief appearing to no purpose JUNE 14th there
are three available breaches the walls however are very sheer a
Fortress hewn in the rock Richelieu scanning them dubiously and
battering his best for about a fortnight more is ineffectual on

Whosoever of you is found drunk shall NOT be of the stormparty which
produced such a teetotalism as nothing else had donestorms that
night with extreme audacity The Place has to capitulate glorious
victory honorable defence and Minorca gone

And England is risen to a mere smoky whirlwind of rage sorrow and
darkness against Byng and others Smoky darkness getting streaked
with dangerous fire Tried said his Grace of Newcastle to the City
Deputation Oh indeed he shall be tried immediately he shall be hanged

KING FRIEDRICHS ENIGMA GETS MORE AND MORE STRINGENT

Friedrichs situation in those fatefully questionable months and for
many past especially from January 16th to Julyreaders must imagine
it for there is no description possible In many intricacies Friedrich
has been but never I reckon in any equal to this Himself certain
what the Two Imperial Women have vowed against him self and Winterfeld
certain of that sad truth and all other mortals ready to deny it and
fly delirious on hint of it should he venture to act in consequence
Friedrichs situation is not unimaginable when as can now be done by
candid inquirers who will take trouble enough the one or two internal
facts of it are disengaged from the roaring ocean of clamorous delusions
which then enveloped them to everybody and are held steadily in view
said ocean being well run off to the home of it very deep underground
Lies do fall silent truth waits to be recognized not always in
vain No reader ever will conceive the strangling perplexity of that
situation now so remote and extinct to us All I can do is to set down
what features of it have become indisputable and leave them as detached
traceries as fractions of an outline to coalesce into something of
image where they can

Winterfelds opinion was for some time past distinct Attack them
since it is certain they only wait to attack us But Friedrich would by
no means listen to that We must not be the aggressor my friend that
would spoil all Perhaps the English will pacify the Russian CATIN for
me tie her with packthreads bribes and intrigues from stirring
Wait watch Fiery Winterfeld who hates the French who despises the
Austrians and thinks the Prussian Army a considerable Fact in Politics
has great schemes far too great for a practical Friedrich Plunge into
the Austrians with a will Prussian Soldierycan Austrians resist
it Ruin them since they are bent on ruining us Stir up the Hungarian
Protestants try all things Home upon our implacable enemies sword
drawn scabbard flung away And the Frenchwhat are the French Our
King should be Kaiser of Teutschland and he can and he maythe
French would then be quieter These things Winterfeld carried in his
head and comrades have heard them from him over wine Retzow i
43 c To all which Friedrich if any whisper of them ever got to
Friedrich would answer one can guess how

It is evident Friedrich had not given up his hope indeed for above a
year more he never did that England might by profuse briberysuch
the power of bribery in that mad courtassuage overnet with
backstairs packthreads or in some way compesce the Russian delirium for
him And England his sole Ally in the world still tender of Austria
and unable to believe what the full intentions of Austria are England
demands much wariness in his procedures towards Austria reiterating
always Wait your Majesty Oh beware

His own Army we need not say is in perfect preparation The Armylet
us guess 150000 regular or near 200000 of all arms and kinds
Archenholtz i 8 counts vaguely 160000 at this date

never was so perfect before or since Old Captains in it whom we used
to know are grayer and wiser young whom we heard less of are grown
veterans of trust Schwerin much a Cincinnatus since we last saw
him has laid down his plough again a fervid little Marlborough of

Friedrichs Army is in the perfection of order Ready at the hour for
many months back but the least motion he makes with it is a subject of
jealousy Last year on those Russian advancings and alacrities he had
marched some Regiments into Pommern within reach of Preussen should
the Russians actually try a stroke there See cried all the world
See cried the enlightened Russian Public This year 1756 from
June onwards and earlier there are still more fatal symptoms on the
Austrian side great and evident Warpreparations Magazines forming
Camps in Bohemia Moravia Camp at Konigsgratz Camp at Praghandy
for the Silesian Border Friedrich knows they have deliberated on their
Pretext for a War and have fixed on what will dosome new small

some time ago this one but is capable of being ripped up againand
that on this cobweb of a pretext they mean to draw sword when they
like Russia too has its Pretext ready And if Friedrich hint of
stirring England whispers hoarse England and other friends Wait
your Majesty Oh beware To keep ones sword at its sharpest and
with an easy patient air ones eyes vigilantly open this is nearly all
that Friedrich can do in neighborhood of such portentous imminencies
He has many critics near and farfor instance

BERLIN 31st JULY 1756 Excellency Valori writes to Versailles  to
give you account of a Conversation I have had a day or two ago with
the Prince of Prussia August Wilhelm HeirApparent who honors me
with a particular confidenceand who appears to be privately like
some others very strong in the Opposition view He talked to me of
the present condition of the King his Brother of his Brothers
apprehensions of his military arrangements of the little trust placed
in him by neighbors of their hostile humor towards him and of many
other things which this good Prince little understanding them as would
appear or the dangerous secret that lay under them did not approve
of The Prince then saidlisten to what the Prince of Prussia said to
Valori one of the last days of July 1756

There is an Anecdote which continually recurs to me in the passes we
are got to at present Putting the case we might be attacked by Russia
and perhaps by Austria the late Rothenburg was sent as readers know
on the Kings part to Milord Tyrconnel to know of him what in such
case were the helps he might reckon on from France Milord enumerated
the various helps and then added being a blusterous Irishman sent
hither for his ill tongue Helps enough you observe Monsieur but
MORBLEU if you deceive us you will be squelched VOUS SEREZ ECRASES
The King my Brother was angry enough at hearing such a speech but
my dear Marquis and the Prince turned full upon me with a face of
inquiry Can the thing actually come true And do you think it can be
the interest of your Master and his Scarlet Woman to abandon us to the
fury of our enemies Ah that cursed Convention NeutralityConvention
with England I would give a finger from my hand that it had never been
concluded I never approved of it ask the Duc de Nivernois he knows
what we said of it together But how return on our steps Who would now
trust us This Prince appeared to be much affected by the King his
Brothers situation of which he understood as good as nothing and
agreed that he the King his Brother had well deserved it Valori
ii 129131

This is not the first example nor the last of August Wilhelms
owning a heedless goodnatured tongue considerably prone to take
the Opposition side on light grounds For which if he found a kind of
solacement and fame in some circles it was surely at a dear rate
To his Brother that bad habit would most likely be known and his
Brother I suppose did not speak of it at all such his Brothers
custom in cases of the kindJudicious Valori by way of answer
dilated on the peculiar esteem of his Majesty Louis XV for the Prussian
Majestyso as my Instructions direct me to do and we hear no more
of the Prince of Prussias talk at this time but shall in future and
may conjecture a great deal about the atmosphere Friedrich had now to
live in A Friedrich undergoing privately a great deal of criticism
Mad tendency to war lust of conquest contempt for his neighbors for
the opinion of the worldno end of irrational tendencies Ib ii

his Problem is deeply unknown

One wise thing the English have done sent an Excellency Mitchell a man
of loyalty of sense and honesty to be their Resident at Berlin This
is the noteworthy not yet much noted Sir Andrew Mitchell by far the
best Excellency England ever had in that Court An Aberdeen Scotchman
creditable to his Country hardheaded sagacious sceptical of shows
but capable of recognizing substances withal and of standing loyal
to them stubbornly if needful who grew to a great mutual regard with
Friedrich and well deserved to do so constantly about him during the
next seven years and whose Letters are among the perennially valuable
Documents on Friedrichs History Happily secured in the British
Museum and now in the most perfect order for consulting thanks to Sir
F Madden and three years labor well investedshould certainly
and will one day be read to the bottom and cleared of their
darknesses extrinsic and intrinsic which are considerable by somebody
competent

Mitchell is in Berlin since June 10th Mitchell who is on the scene
itself and looking into Friedrich with his own eyes finds the
reiterating of that Beware your Majesty which had been his chief
task hitherto a more and more questionable thing and suggests to him
at last Plainly ask her Hungarian Majesty What is your meaning by
those Bohemian Campings Pshaw answers Friedrich Nothing but
some ambiguous answer perhaps with insult in itnevertheless thinks
better and determines to do so Mitchell Papers




Chapter IVFRIEDRICH PUTS A QUESTION AT VIENNA TWICE OVER

July 18th 1756 Friedrich despatches an Express to Graf von Klinggraf
his Resident at Vienna an experienced man whom we have seen before in
old Carteret ConferenceofHanau times To demand audience of the
Empress and in the fittest terms friendly and courteous brief and
clear to put that question of Mitchells suggesting Those unwonted
Armaments Camps in Bohmen Camps in Mahren and military movements
and preparations Klinggraf is to say have caused anxiety in her
Majestys peaceable Neighbor of Prussia who desires always to continue
in peace and who requests hereby a word of assurance from her Majesty
that these his anxieties are groundless Friedrich himself hopes little
or nothing from this but he has done it to satisfy people about him
and put an end to all scruples in himself and others The Answer may be
expected in ten or twelve days

And about the same timelikely enough directly after though there
is no date given to a fact which is curious and authentic

Friedrich sent for two of his chief Generals to Potsdam for a secret
Conference with Winterfeld and him The Generals are old Schwerin and
General Retzow SeniorMajorGeneral Retzow whom we used to hear of in
the Silesian Warsand whose Son reports on this occasion Conference
is on this Imminency of War and as to what shall be done in it
Friedrich explains in general terms his dangers from Austria and Russia
his certainty that Austria will attack him and asks Were it or were
it not better to attack Austria as is our Prussian principle in such
case Schwerin and RetzowSchwerin first as the eldest and after
him Retzow who privately has charge from the Prussian Princes to do
itopine strongly That indications are uncertain that much seems
inevitable which does not come that in a time of such tumultuous
whirlings and unexpected changes the true rule is Watch well and
wait

After enough of this with Winterfeld looking dissent but saying almost
nothing Friedrich gives sign to Winterfeldwho spreads out in their
lucidest prearranged order the principal MenzelWeingarten Documents
and bids the two Military Gentlemen read They read with astonishment
are forced to believe stand gazing at one anotherand do now take
a changed tone Schwerin after a silence of everybody for some
minutesbursts out like one inspired If War is to be and must be
let us start tomorrow seize Saxony at once and in that rich corny
Country form Magazines for our Operations on Bohemia Retzow i 39

That is privately Friedrichs own full intention Saxony with its Elbe
River as Highway is his indispensable preliminary for Bohemia and he
will not a second time as he did in 1744 with such results leave it
in an unsecured condition Adieu then Messieurs silent AU REVOIR
which may be soon Retzow Junior a rational sincere but rather
pipeclayed man who is wholly to be trusted on this Conference with
his Father for authority has some touches of commentary on it which
indicate date being 1802 that till the end of his life or of Prince
Henri his Patrons there remained always in some heads a doubt as to
Friedrichs wisdom in regard to starting the SevenYears War and to
Schwerins entire sincerity in that inspired speech And still more
curious that there was always at Potsdam as elsewhere a Majestys
Opposition Party privately intent to look at the wrong side and doing
it diligentlythough with lips strictly closed for most part without
words except wellweighed and to the wise which is an excellent
arrangement for a Majesty and Majestys Opposition where feasible in
the world

From Retzow I learn farther that Winterfeld directly on the back of
this Conference took a Tour to the Bohemian Baths To Karlsbad or
Toplitz for ones health and wandered about a good deal in those
Frontier Mountains of Bohemia taking notes taking sketches not with
a picturesque view and returned by the Saxon Pirna Country a strange
stony labyrinth which he guessed might possibly be interesting soon
The Saxon Commandant of the Konigstein lofty Fortress of those parts
strongest in Saxony was of Winterfelds acquaintance Winterfeld called
on this Commandant found his Konigstein too high for cannonading those
neighborhoods but that there was at the base of it a new Work going
on and that the Saxons were though languidly endeavoring to bestir
themselves in matters military Their entire Army at present is under
20000 but in the course of next Winter they expect to have
it 40000 Shall be of that force against Season 1757 No doubt
Winterfelds gatherings and communications had their uses at Potsdam on
his getting home from this Tour to Toplitz

Meanwhile Klinggraf has had his Audience at Vienna and has sped as
ill as could have been expected The Answer given was of supercilious
brevity evasive in effect null and as good as answering That there
is no answer Two Accounts we have as Friedrich successively had them
of this famed passage FIRST Klinggrafs own which is clear rapid
and stands by the essential SECOND an account from the other side of
the scenes furnished by Menzel of Dresden for Friedrichs behoof
and ours which curiously illustrates the foregoing and confirms the
interpretation Friedrich at once made of it This is Menzels account
in other words the Saxon Envoy at Viennas stolen by Menzel

July 26th it appears Klinggrafhaving applied to Kaunitz the
day before who noticed a certain flurry in him and had answered
carelessly Audience Yes of course nay I am this moment going to
the Empress only you must tell me about whatwas admitted to the
Imperial Presence he first of many that were waiting Imperial Presence
held in its hand a snip of Paper carefully composed by Kaunitz from the
data and read these words DIE BEDENKLICHEN UMSTANDE The questionable
circumstances of the Time have moved me to consider as indispensably
necessary those measures which for my own security and for defence
of my Allies I am taking and which otherwise do not tend the least
towards injury of anybody whatsoeverand adding no syllable more
gave a sign with her hand intimating to Klinggraf that the Interview
was done Klinggraf strode through the Antechamber visibly
astonished say onlookers at such an Answer had Answer in
fact That there is no answer and the door flung in your face
_HeldenGeschichte _iii 772 In Valori ii 128 Friedrichs little
Paper of INSTRUCTIONS to Klinggraf this Vienna ANSWER to it ib
138see ib 138 162 and _Gesammelte Nachrichten _ii 214221

Friedrich on arrival of report from Klinggraf and without waiting for
the Menzel side of the scenes sees that the thing is settled Writes
again however August 2d probably the day after or the same day
Klinggrafs Despatch reached him instructing Klinggraf To request
a less oracular response and specially If her Imperial Majesty
Austria and Russia being as is understood in active League against
him will say That Austria will not attack him this year or the
next Draw up memorial of that Monsieur Klinggraf and send us
the supercilious NoAnswer till which arrive we do not cross the
Frontierbut are already everywhere on march to it in an industrious
cunningly devised evident and yet impenetrably mysterious manner

Excellency Valori never saw such activity of military preparation such
Artillery 2000 big pieces in the Park here Regiments Wagontrains
getting under way everywhere no man can guess whitherward drawn up in
the Square here they know not by what Gate they are to march By three
different Gates I should thinkmysteriously in Three Directions
known only to King Friedrich and his AdjutantGeneral all these
Regiments in Berlin and elsewhere are on march Towards Halle Leipzig
way towards Brietzen Wittenberg and Torgau way towards Bautzen
neighborhoodtowards Three settled Points of the Saxon Frontier will
step across the instant the supercilious NoAnswer comes to hand Are to
converge about Dresden and the Saxon Switzerlandabout 65000 strong
equipped as no Army before or since has beenand take what luck there
may be

Bruhl and Polish Majestys Army still only about 18000 have their
apprehensions of such visit but what can they do The Saxon Army draws
out into Camp at sight of this mysterious marching strong Camp in the
angle of Elbe and Mulde Riversthen draws in again being too weak
for use And is thinking Menzel informs us to take post in the stony
labyrinthic Pirna Country such the advice an Excellency Broglio has
givenFrench Excellency now in Dresden Marechal de Broglios Son
and of little less explosive nature than his Father was Bruhl
and Polish Majesty guessing that the hour is come are infinitely
interested Interested not flurried AustrianRussian AntiPrussian
Covenant say Bruhl and Majesty rather comfortably to themselves We
never signed it WE never would sign anything what have we to do with
it Courage steady To Pirna if they come Are not Excellency Broglio
and France and Austria and the whole world at our back

It was full three weeks before Klinggrafs Message of Answer could
arrive at Berlin Of Friedrich in the interim launching such a
worldadventure himself silent in the midst of a buzzing Berlin
take these indications which are luminous enough Duke Ferdinand
of Brunswick is to head one of the Three Columns Duke Ferdinand
Governor of Magdeburg is now collecting his Column in that
neighborhood chiefly at Halle whitherward or on what errand is
profoundly unknown Unknown even to Ferdinand except that it is for
actual Service in the Field Here are two Friedrich Letters ruggedly
Official the first of them and not quite peculiar to Ferdinand which
are worth reading


THE KING TO DUKE FERDINAND OF BRUNSWICK

POTSDAM 15th August 1756

For time of FieldService I have made the arrangement That for the
Subaltern Officers of your regiment over and above their ordinary
Equipagemoneys there shall to each Subaltern Officer and once for
all be Eight Thalers twentyfour shillings sterling advanced That
sum eight thalers per subaltern shall be paid to the Captain of every
Company and besides this there shall monthly Two Thalers be deducted
from the Subalterns Pay and be likewise paid over to the Captainin
return for which He is to furnish Free Table for the Subalterns
throughout the Campaign and so long as the regiment is in the field

Of the Two Baggagecarts per Company the regiment shall take only One
and leave the other at home No Officer let him be who or of what title
he will Generals not excepted shall take with him the least of Silver
Plate not even a silver spoon Whoever wants therefore to keep
table great or small TAFEL ODER TISCH must manage the same with tin
utensilswithout exception be he who he will

Each Captain shall take with him a little Cask of Vinegar of which as
soon as the regiments get to Camp he must give me reckoning and I
will then have him repaid This Vinegar shall solely and exclusively be
employed for this purpose That in places where the water is bad there
be poured into it for the soldiers a few drops of the vinegar to
correct the water and thereby preserve them from illnesses

So soon as the regiment gets on march the Women who have permission
to follow are put under command of the Profoss that thereby all
plunderings and disorders may the more be guarded against If the
Captains and Officers take Grooms JAGER or the like Domestics there
can muskets be given to these that use may be had of them in case of
an attack in quarters or on march when a WAGENBURG wagonfortress is
to be formed FRIEDRICH Preuss ii 6 7

SAME TO SAME Confidential this one

POTSDAM 24th August

 Make as if you were meaning to go into Camp at Halle The reason
why I stop you is that the Courier from Vienna has not yet come
We must therefore reassure the Saxon neighborhood  I have
been expecting answer from hour to hour cannot suitably begin a
WarExpedition till it come do therefore apprise Your Dilection though
under the deepest secrecy

And it is necessary and my Will is That till farther order you keep
all the regiments and corps belonging to your Column in the places where
they are when this arrives And shall meanwhile with your best skill
mask all this both from the Town of Halle and from the regiments
themselves making in conformity with what I said yesterday as if you
were a Corps of Observation come to encamp here and were waiting the
last orders to go into camp

that Phenomenon read only these Two Notes

Berlin

POTSDAM 25th August 1756

MY DEAR BROTHER MY DEAR SISTERI write to you both at once for want
of time I will follow the advice you are so good as give me and will
take leave of the Queen our dear Mamma by Letter And that the reading
of my Letter may not frighten her I will send it by my Sister to be
presented in a favorable moment

I have yet got no Answer from Vienna by Klinggrafs account I shall
not receive it till tomorrow came this night But I count myself
surer of War than ever as the Austrians have named Generals and their
Army is ordered to march from Kolin to KonigsgratzSchlesien way So
that expecting nothing but a haughty Answer or a very uncertain one
on which there will be no reliance possible I have arranged everything
for setting out on Saturday next Tomorrow so soon as the news comes
I will not fail to let you know Assuring you that I am with a perfect
affection my dear Brother and my dear SisterYoursF _OEuvres de
Frederic_ xxvi 155

Answer comes from Klinggraf that same night Once more an Answer almost
worse than could have been expected The League with Russia against
you is nonextant a thing of your imagination Have not we already
answered In _Gesammelte Urkunden _i 217 Klinggrafs second

POTSDAM 26th August 1756

MY DEAR BROTHERI have already written to the Queen softening things
as much as I could Letter lost My Sister to whom I address the
Letter will deliver it

You have seen the Paper I sent to Klinggraf Their Answer is That they
have not made an Offensive Alliance with Russia against me The Answer
is impertinent high and contemptuous and of the Assurance that I
required as to This Year and next not one word So that the sword
alone can cut this Gordian Knot I am innocent of this War I have
done what I could to avoid it but whatever be ones love of peace one
cannot and must not sacrifice to that ones safety and ones honor
Such I believe will be your opinion too from the sentiments I know in
you At present our one thought must be To do War in such a way as may
cure our Enemies of their wish to break Peace again too soon I embrace
you with all my heart I have had no end of business TERRIBLEMENT A

THE MARCH INTO SAXONY IN THREE COLUMNS

Ahead of that last Note from an earlier hour of the same day Thursday
26th August there is speeding forth to all Three Generals of Division
this Order take Duke Ferdinands copynot in original

I hereby order that Your Dilection EW LIEBDEN with all the
regiments and corps in the Column standing under your command Shall
now without more delay get on march on the 29th inst and proceed
according to the MarchTables and Instructions already given to execute
what Your Dilection has got in chargeF

The same Thursday 26th Excellency Mitchell informed by Podewils
of the Kings wish to see him at Potsdam gets under way from Berlin
arrives just time enough to speak with the King before he sat down to
supper Very many things to be consulted of and deliberatively touched
upon with Mitchell and England no end of things and considerations
for England and King Friedrich in this that is now about to burst forth
on an astonished worldOver in London we observe just in the hours
when Mitchell was harnessing for Potsdam and so many Orders and Letters
were speeding their swiftest in that quarter there is going forward on
TowerHill yonder the following Operation

LONDON THURSDAY 26th AUGUST 1756 About five in the afternoon a
noted Admiral only in Effigy as yet but who has been held in miserable
durance and too actual question of death or life ever since his
return Oh yes indeed Hang HIM at onceif that can be a remedy
was after having been privately shown to many ladies and gentlemen
broughtin an open sedan guarded by a number of young gentlemen under
arms with drums beating colors flyingto TowerHill where a Gallows
had been erected for him at six the same morning He was richly dressed
in a blue and gold coat buff waistcoat trimmed c in full uniform
When brought under the Gallows he stayed a small space till his
clergyman a chimneysweeper had given him some admonitions that done
he was drawn by pulleys to the top of the Gallows which was twenty
feet high every person expressing as much satisfaction as if it had
been the real man

He remained there guarded by the above volunteers without any
molestation two hours when upon a supposition of being obstructed by
the Governor of the Tower some sailors appeared who wanted to pull him
down in order to drag him along the streets But a fire being kindled
which consisted of tarbarrels fagots tables tubs c he was
consumed in about half an hour Old Newspapers _Gentlemans Magazine
_ xxvi 409

That is their employment on TowerHill over yonder while Mitchell is
getting under way to see Friedrich

Mitchell continued at Potsdam over Friday and was still in eager
consultation that night when the King said to him with a certain
expressiveness of glance BON SOIR thenTomorrow morning about
four And on the morrow Saturday 28th Mitchell reports hurriedly

 Am just returned to Berlin in time to write to your Lordship This
morning between four and five I took leave of the King of Prussia
He went immediately upon the Parade mounted on horseback and after
a very short exercise of his Troops put himself at their head and
marched directly for Belitz halfway to Brietzen TREUENbrietzen
as they call it where Tomorrow he will enter the Saxon
Territoryas at their respective points his two other Columns
willand begin who shall say what terrible game incalculable to your
Lordship and me with such Operations afoot on TowerHill Mitchell

Seven Hussar Regiments of Duke Ferdinands Column got the length of
Leipzig that Sunday Evening 29th and took possession of the place In
_HeldenGeschichte _iii 731 his Proclamation there 29th August
1756 Duke Ferdinand to right of the King Duke of BrunswickBevern to
leftthe Three Columns cross the Border at points say 80 miles
from one another occasionally on the march bending to rightwards and
leftwards to take in the principal Towns and make settlements there
the two might be above a hundred miles from Friedrich on each hand The
length of march for each ColumnFerdinand from Leipzig by Chemnitz
Freyberg Dippoldiswalde to the Village of Cotta Pirna neighborhood
south of Elbe Bevern through the Lausitz by Bautzen to Lohmen
same neighborhood north of Elbe King Friedrich to Dresden by the
course of the Elbe itself was not far from equal and may be called
about 150 miles They marched with diligence not with hurry had their
pauses restdays when business required They got to their ground
with the simultaneousness appointed on the eleventh or twelfth day

The middle Column under the King where Marshal Keith is second
in command goes by Torgau detaching Moritz of Dessau to pick up
Wittenberg and ruin the slight works there crosses the Elbe at
Torgau September 2d marches cantoning itself day after day along the
southern bank of the River leaves Meissen to the left I perceive does
not pass through Meissen comes first at Wilsdruf on ground where
we have beenand portions of it I doubt not were billeted in
Kesselsdorf and would take a glance at the old Field if they had time
There is strict discipline in all the Columns the authorities complying
on summons and arranging what is needful Nobody resists townguards
at once ground arms and there is no soldier visible soldiers all
ebbing away whitherward we guess _HeldenGeschichte _iii 732 733
_OEuvres de Frederic_ iv 81

At Wilsdruf Friedrich first learns for certain that the Saxon Army
with King with Bruhl and other chief personages are withdrawn to
Pirna to the inexpugnable Konigstein and RockCountry The Saxon Army
had begun assembling there September 1st directly on the news that
Friedrich was across the Border September 9th on Friedrichs approach
the King and Dignitaries move off thither from Dresden out of his
way Excellency Broglio has put them on that plan Which may have its
complexities for Friedrich hopes Brogliothough perhaps its still
greater for some other parties concerned For Bruhl and Polish Majesty
as will appear by and by nothing could have turned out worse

Meanwhile Friedrich pushes on Forward all the same Polish Majesty
dating from Struppen in the Pirna Country has begun a Correspondence
with Friedrich very polite on both hands and his AdjutantGeneral the
Chevalier Meagher Chevalier de MARRE as Valori calls himMAAR as
he calls himself in Irish has just had at Wilsdruf an interview with
Friedrich but is far from having got settlement on the terms he wished
Polish Majesty magnanimously assenting to a Road through his Country
for military purposes offers the strictest Neutrality strictest
friendship even has done and will do no injury whatever to his
Prussian MajestyDid we ever SIGN anything whisper comfortably
Bruhl and he to one anotherexpects therefore that his Prussian
Majesty will march on whither he is bound and leave him unmolested
here _HeldenGeschichte _ iii 774

That was Meaghers message that is the purport of all his Polish
Majestys Eleven Letters to Friedrich which precede or follow
reiterating with a certain bovine obstinacy insensible to time or
change That such is Polish Majestys fixed notion Strict neutrality
friendship even and leave me unmolested here In _OEuvres de
Frederic_ iv 235260 29th August10th September18th September
1756 are collected now the Eleven Letters with their Answers
Strict neutrality yes but disperse your Army then answers
Friedrich send your Army back to its cantonments I must myself
have the keeping of my Highway lest I lose it as in 1744 This is
Friedrichs answer this at first and for some time coming though as
the aspects change and the dangerous elements heap themselves higher
Friedrichs answer will rise with them and his terms like the Sibyls
become worse and worse This is the utmost that Meagher at Wilsdruf
can make of it and this in conceivable circumstances will grow less
and less

Next day September 9th Friedrich with some Battalions entered
Dresden most of his Column taking Camp near by General Wylich had
entered yesterday and is already Commandant there Friedrich sends by
Feldmarschall Keith highest Officer of his Column his homages to her
Polish Majestynothing given us of Keiths Interview except by a
sidewind That Majesty complained of those Prussian Sentries walking
about in certain of her corridors with an eye to Something it may be
fearedof which doubtless Keith undertook to make report Friedrich
himself waits upon the Junior Princes who are left here is polite and
gracious as ever though strict and with business enough lodges for
his own part in the GardenHouse of Princess Moczinskaand next
morning leads off his Column a short march eastward to the Pirna
Country where on the right and on the left Ferdinand at Cotta Bevern
at Lohmen if readers will look on their Map he finds the other Two in
their due positions Headquarter is GrossSedlitz westernmost skirt
of the Rockregion and will have to continue so much longer than had
been expected

The Diplomatic world in Dresden is in great emotion more especially
just at present This morning before leaving Friedrich had to do
an exceedingly strict thing secure the Originals of those Menzel
Documents Originals indispensable to him for justifying his new
procedures upon Saxony So that there has been at the Palace a Scene
this morning of a very high and dissonant natureMarshal Keith in
it Marshal Keith making a second visit say some loose and false
Accountsthe facts being strictly as follows

Far from removing those Prussian sentries complained of last night
here seems to be a double strength of them this morning And her
Polish Majesty a severe hardfeatured old Lady has been filled with
indignant amazement by a Prussian OfficerMajor von Wangenheim I
believe it isrequiring in the King of Prussias name the Keys of
that Archiveroom Prussian Majesty absolutely needing sight for a
little while of certain Papers there Enter that room Archives of
a crowned Head Let me see the living mortal that will dare to do
itone fancies the indignant Polish Majestys answer and how
calling for materials she openly sealed the door in question in
Wangenheims presence As this is a celebrated Passage which has been
reported in several loose ways let us take it from the primary source
Chancery style and all Graf von Sternberg Austrian Excellency writing
from the spot and at the hour informs his own Court and through that
all Courts in these solemnly Official terms

DRESDEN 10th SEPTEMBER 1756 The Queens Majesty this forenoon has
called to her all the Foreign Ministers now at Dresden and in Highest
Own Person has signified to us How the Prussian intrusions and
hostilities being already known Highest said Queens Majesty would now
simply state what had farther taken place this morning

Highest said Queens Majesty to wit had in her own name requested
the King of Prussia in conformity with his assurances by Keith
yesternight of paying every regard for Her and the Royal
Family To remove the Prussian Sentries pacing about in those
CorridorsCorridors which lead to the Secret Archives important to
some of usInstead of which the said King had not only doubled
his Sentries there but also by an Officer demanded the Keys of the
Archiveapartment just alluded to And as the Queens Majesty for
security of all writings there offered to seal the Door of it herself
and did so there and thenthe said Officer had so little respect
that he clapped his own seal thereon too

Nor was he content therewithnot by any meansbut the same
Officer having been with Wylich Commandant here came back a short
time after and made for opening of the Door himself Which being
announced to the Queens Majesty she in her own person HOCHSTDIESELBE
HighesttheSame went out again and standing before the Door informed
him How HighesttheSame had too much regard to his Prussian Majestys
given assurance to believe that such order could proceed from the
King As the Officer however replied That he was sorry to have such
an order to execute but that the order was serious and precise and
that he by not executing it would expose himself to the greatest
responsibility Her Majesty continued standing before the Door and
said to the Officer If he meant to use force he might upon Her make
his beginning There is for you Herr Wangenheim

Upon which said Officer had gone away to report anew to the King I
think only to Wylich the Commandant King now a dozen miles off not
so easily reported to and his mind known and in the mean while Her
Majesty had called to her the Prussian and English Ambassadors
Mahlzahn and Stormont sorry both of them but how entirely
resourcelessespecially Mahlzahn and had represented and
repeated to them the above beseeching that by their remonstrances and
persuasions they would induce the King of Prussia conformably with his
given assurance to forbear Instead however of any fruit from such
remonstrances and urgencies final Order came That Queens Majestys
own Highest Person notwithstanding force must be used

Whereupon her Majesty to avoid actual mistreatment had been obliged
toto become passive and no Keys being procurable from her see
a smith with his picklocks give these Prussians admission
LegationSecretary Plessmann was there Menzel one fancies sitting
rather pale in an adjacent room Supra p 266 and they knew what
to do Their smith opens the required Box for them one of several all

Poor old Lady what a situation And I believe she never saw her poor
old Husband again The day he went to Pirna morning of yesterday
September 9th Friedrich entering in the evening these poor Spouses
had little dreaming of it taken leave of one another forevermore Such
profit lies in your Bruhl Kings and Queens that will be governed by a
Jesuit Guarini and a Bruhl of the Twelve Tailors sometimes pay dear
for it They or their representatives are sure to do so Kings and
Queensyes and if that were all but their poor Countries too Their

shapes ENOUGH Their Countries should have been in watch against
Beelzebub in the shape of Bruhlswatching and also praying in a
heroic manner now fallen obsolete in these impious times




Chapter VFRIEDRICH BLOCKADES THE SAXONS IN PIRNA COUNTRY

Friedrich reckons himself to have 65000 men in Saxony Schwerin is
issuing from Silesia through the Glatz Mountains for Bohemia at the
head of 40000 The Austrian force is inferior in quantity and far from
readyTwo Camps in Bohemia they have the chief one under
Browne looking or intending this Saxon way and a smaller under
Piccolomini in the KonigshofKolin regionif well run into from front
and rear both Browne and Piccolomini might be beautifully handled and
a gash be cut in Austria which might incline her to be at peace again
Nothing hinders but this paltry Camp of the Saxons itself only 18000
strong but in a Country of such strength And this does hinder
effectually while it continues How march to Bohemia and leave the
road blocked in our rear

The Saxon Camp did continueunmanageable by any method for five weeks
to come the season of waroperations gone by that timeand
Friedrichs First Campaign rendered mostly fruitless in this manner
will by no means check the Austrian truculencies as by his velocity he
hoped to do No but on the contrary will rouse the Austrians French
and all Enemies to a tenfold pitch of temper And bring upon himself
from an astonished and misunderstanding Public such tempests and world
tornadoes of loudroaring obloquy as even he Friedrich had never
endured before

To readers of a touring habit this Saxon Country is perhaps well known
For the last halfcentury it has been growing more and more famous
under the name of Saxon Switzerland SACHSISCHE SCHWEITZ instead of
Misnian Highlands MEISSNISCHE HOCHLAND which it used to be called
A beautiful enough and extremely rugged Country interesting to the
picturesque mind Begins rising in soft Hills on both sides of the
Elbe a few miles east of Dresden as you ascend the River till it
rises into Hills of wild character getting ever wilder and riven into
wondrous chasms and precipices Extends say almost twenty miles up
the River to Tetschen and beyond in this eastern direction and with
perhaps ten miles of breadth on each side of the River area of the
Rockregion therefore is perhaps some four hundred square miles The
Falkenberg what we should call HAWKSCRAG northeastward in the Lausitz
the Schneeberg SNOW MOUNTAIN southeastward on the Bohemian border
are about thirtyfive miles apart these two are both reckoned to be in
itits last outposts on that eastern side But the limits of it are
fixed by custom only and depend on no natural condition

We might define it as the Sandstone NECK of the Metal Mountains a
rather lower block of Sandstone intercalated into the MetalMountain
range which otherwise on both hands is higher and of harder rocks
Southward as SHOULDER to this sandstone NECK lies continuous broad
and high the MetalMountain range specially so called northward
and northeastward there rise beyond that Falkenberg many mountains
solitary or in groupsthe Metal Mountains fading out here into the
Lausitz Hills still in fine picturesque fashion which are Northern
Border to the great Bohemian Basin of the Elba after you emerge from
this Sandstone Country

Saxon Switzerland is not very high anywhere 2000 feet is a notable
degree of height but it is torn and tumbled into stone labyrinths
chasms and winding rockwalls as few regions are Grows pinewood to
the topmost height pinetrees far aloft look quietly down upon you
over sheer precipices on your intricate path On the slopes of the
Hills is grass enough in the intervals are Villages and husbandries
are corn and milk for the laborious nativeswho depend mainly on
quarrying and pineforest work pines and freestone rafts of long
slim pines and big stone barges are what one sees upon the River
there A Note not very geological says of it

Elbe sweeps freely through this Country for ages and aeons past
curling himself a little into snakefigure and with increased
velocity but silent mostly and trim to the edge a fine flintcolored
riverthough in aeons long anterior it must have been a very
different matter for torrents and waterpower The Country is one huge
Block of Sandstone so many square miles of that material ribbed
channelled torn and quarried in this manner by the everbusy
elements for a million of Ages past Chiefly by the Elbe himself since
he got to be a River and became cosmic and personal ceasing to be a
mere watery chaos of Lakes and Deluges hereabouts For the Sandstone was
of various degrees of hardness tenacious as marble some parts of
it soft almost as sand other parts And the primordial diluviums and
worldold torrents great and small rushing down from the Bohemian
Highlands from the Saxon Metal Mountains with such storming gurgling
and swashing have swept away the soft parts and left the hard standing
in this chaotic manner and bequeathed it all to the Elbe and the
common frosts and rains of these human ages

Elbe has now a trim course but Elbe too is busy quarrying and mining
where not artificially held inand you notice at every outlet of a
Brook from the interior north side and south side how busy the Brook
has been Boring grinding undermining much helped by the frosts by
the rains AEons ago the Brook was a lake in the interior but was
every moment laboring to get out till it has cut for itself that
mountain gullet or sheerdown chasm and brought out with it an
Alluvium or Deltaon which since Adams time human creatures have
built a Hamlet That is the origin or unwritten history of most
hamlets and cultivated spots you fall in with here they are the waste
shavings of the Brook working millions of years for its own object
of getting into the Elbe in level circumstances Ploughed fields not
without fertility are in the interior if you ascend that Brook the
Hamlet at the delta or mouth of it is as if built upon its TONGUE
and into its GULLET think how picturesque in the November rains for
example

The road one road from Dresden to Aussig to Lobositz Budin Prag
runs up the riverbrink south brink or in our day as PragDresden
Railway thunders through those solitudes strangely awakening their
echoes and inviting even the bewildered Tourist to reflect if he
could The bewildered Tourist sees rockwalls heavenhigh on both hands
of him River and he rushing on between by law of gravitation law of
ennui which are laws of Nature both with a narrow strip of sky in
full gallop overhead and has little encouragement to reflect except
upon his own sorrows and delirious circumstances physical and moral
How much happier were I lying in my bed thinks the bewildered
Touristdoes strive withal to admire the Picturesque but with little
success notices the BASTEI Bastion and other rigorously prescribed
points of the Sublime and Beautiful which are to be done That
you will have to DO my friend step out you will have to go on that
Pinnacle with indifferent Hotel attached on that iron balcony aloft
among the clouds yonder and shudder to project over Elbeflood from
such altitudes admiring the Picturesque in prescribed manner

This Country has for its permanent uses timber freestone modicum
of milk and haver serviceable to the generalityand to his Polish
Majesty at present it is as the very Ark of Noah priceless at this
juncture being the strongest military country in the world Excellent
strength in it express Fortresses especially one Fortress called the
Konigstein not far from Schandau of a towering precipitous nature
with a well 900 feet deep in it and pleasant Village outside at the
baseFortress which is still in our day reckoned a safe place for
the Saxon Archives and preciosities Impregnable to gunpowder artillery
not to be had except by hunger And then farther down the River close
by Pirna presiding over Pirna as that Konigstein in some sort does
over Schandau is the Sonnenstein Sonnenstein too was a Fortress in
those days of Friedrich but not impregnable if judged worth taking
The Austrians took it a year or two hence Friedrich retook it
dismantled it the Sonnenstein is now a Madhouse say the Guidebooks

Sonnenstein stands close east or upstream of Pirna which is a town of
5000 souls by much the largest in those parts Konigstein a little
downstream of Schandau which latter is on the opposite or north side
of the River These are the two chief Towns which do all the trade of
this region picturesque places boththe Tourist remembers Pirna
Standing on its sleek table or stairstep by the Rivers edge well

recollect yes truly and the Bath Season making its packages in
great haste breaking up prematurely this Year 1756

Directly on arriving at GrossSedlitz Friedrich takes ocular survey
of this Country which is already not unknown to him He finds that the
Saxons have secured themselves within the Mountains a rocky streamlet
Brook of Gottleube which issues into Elbe just between GrossSedlitz
and them through a dell of eighty or a hundred feet deep serving
as their first defence well in front of the mere rocky Heights and
precipices behind it which stretch continuously along to southward
six miles or more from Pirna and the south brink of Elbe At
LangenHennersdorf which is the southernmost part these Heights make
an elbow inwards by Leopoldshayn towards the Konigstein which is but
four miles off here too the Saxons are defended by a Brook running
straight towards Konigstein this one in front of their Heights and
stand defensive in this way along a rockbulwark of ten miles long
the passes all secured by batteries by abatis palisades mile after
mile as Friedrich rides observant leftward behind them Elbe rushing
swifter through his rockwalls yonder with chasms and intricate gorges
defending them inexpugnably to rear Six miles long of natural bulwark
six to Hennersdorf where the gross of the Saxons lie then to
Konigstein four other miles sufficiently if more sparsely beset by
them No stronger position in the world Friedrich thinks _OEuvres
de Frederic_ iv 83 84 not a very distinct Account and far from
accurate in the detailswhich are left without effectual correction
even in the best Editionsand that it is impossible to force this
place without a loss of life disproportionate even to its importance
at present Not to say that the Saxons will make terms all the easier
BEFORE bloodshed rise between usand furthermore that Hunger for
we hear they have provision only for two weeks may itself soon do it
Wedge them in therefore block every outgate every entrance nothing
to get in except gradually Hunger Hunger and on our part rational
Offers will suffice That is Friedrichs plan good in itselfthough
the ovine obstinacy and other circumstances retarded the execution of
it to an unexpected extent lamentable to Friedrich and to some others

The PrussianSaxon military operations for the next five weeks need not
detain us Their respective positions on the Heights behind that Brook
Gottleube and on the plainer Country in front of it

How the Prussians lie first Division of them from GrossSedlitz to
Zehist under the King then second Division from Zehist to Cotta and
onward by the Rothschenke REDHOUSE Tavern by Markersbach and
sparsely as far as Hellendorf on the Prag Highway in brief where all
the Divisions of them lie and under whom and where the Prussians
watching Elbe itself have Batteries and Posts on the north side of it
all this is marked on the Mapto satisfy ingenuous curiosity should
it make tour in those parts To which add only these straggles of Note
as farther elucidative

The Saxons between Elbe and their Lines possess about thirty square
miles of country From Pirna or Sonnenstein to Konigstein as the crow
flies may be five miles east to west but by LangenHennersdorf and
the elbow there it will be ten at Konigstein moreover Elbe makes
an abrupt turn northward for a couple of miles instead of westward
as heretofore turning abruptly westward again after that so that the
Saxon Camp or Occupancy here is an irregular Trapezium with
Pirna and Konigstein for vertices and with area estimable as
aboveploughable a fair portion of it and not without corn of its
own So that the two weeks provision spun themselves out short
allowance aiding to two months before actual famine came

 The Highroad from the Lausitz parts crosses Elbe at Pirna falls
into the DresdenPrag Highroad there and from Pirna towards Toplitz
for the first few miles this latter runs through the Prussian Posts
but we may guess it is not much travelled at present North of Elbe
too the Prussians have batteries on the fit points detachments of due
force from GrossSedlitz BridgeofPontoons all round to Schandau
or beyond could fire upon the Konigstein across the River they
have plugged up the Saxon position everywhere They have a Battery
especially and strong post to cannonade the Bridge at Pirna should
the Saxons think of trying there It is now the one Saxon or even
HalfSaxon Bridge Sonnenstein and Pirna command the Saxon end of it
a strong battery the Prussian end a Bridge lying mainly idle like the
general Highway to Toplitz at this time Beyond the Konigstein again
at a place called WendischFahre WENDSFERRY the Prussians have
by means of boats swinging wide at anchor on the swift current what is
called a Flyingbridge with which the north side can communicate with
the south They have a post at NiederRaden OBER Raden railway station
in our time is on the south side Nether Raden is an interesting
little Hamlet mostly invisible to mankind built in the THROAT of the
stone chasms there from which you begin mounting to the BASTEI far
aloft A Raden to be noted by the Tourist and us

Little or even nothing of fighting there is why should there be
The military operations are a deadlock and require no word Thirty
thousand half of the Prussian Force lie vigilant as lynxes
blockading here other half 32000 under Marshal Keith have marched
forward to Aussig to Nollendorf on the Bohemian frontier to clear the
ways and look into any Austrian motion thereaboutswith whom with
some Pandour detachment of whom Duke Ferdinand leading the vanguard
has had a little brush among the Hills smiting them home again in his
usual creditable way September 13th and taking Camp at Peterswalde

ANONYMOUS OF HAMBURG i 19 It is with this Keith Army with this if
with any that adventures are to be looked for at present

Polish Majestys Headquarters are at Struppen well in the centre
of the Saxon lines goes always to the Konigstein to sleep Polish
Majestys own table is by Friedrichs permission for that special
object supplied AD LIBITUM but the common men were at once put
on short allowance which grows always the shorter Polish Majesty
corresponds with Friedrich as we saw and above all sends burning
Messages to Austria to France to every European Court charged with
mere shrieks Help me a robber has me In which sense Excellencies
of all kinds especially one Lord Stormont the English Excellency
daily running out from Dresden to GrossSedlitz are passionately
industrious with Friedrich who is eager enough to comply were there
any safe means possible But there are none Unfortunately too
it appears the Austrians are astir Feldmarschall Browne actually
furbishing himself at Prag yonder with an eye hitherward and
extraordinary haste and spirit shown which obliges Friedrich to rise
in his demands ovine obstinacy on the other side naturally increasing
from the same cause

Polish Majesty we say has liberty to bring in proviant for self and
suite rigorously for no mortal more and he lives well in the culinary
sensesurely for most part in his dressinggown too poor loose
collapsed soul Bruhl and he have plenty of formal business but their
one real business is that of crying by estafettes and every conceivable
method to Austria Get us out of this To which Austria has answered
Yes only patience and be steadyFriedrichs headquarters are at
Sedlitz and the negotiating and responding which he has transcends
imagination His first hope was Polish Majesty might be persuaded to
join with himon the back of that certainty gradually coming that
Polish Majesty never would and that the Austrians would endeavor a
rescue were they once ready Starvation or the Austrians which will
be first here is the question and Friedrich studies to think it will
be the former At all events having settled on the starvation method
and seen that all his posts are right we perceive he does not stick
close by Sedlitz but runs now hither now thither is at Torgau where
an important establishment kind of New Government for Saxony on the
Finance side is organizing itself What his work with Ambassadors
was and how delicate the handling needed thinkHere is another
Clipping

 Polish Majesty passes the day at Struppen amid many vain noises
of Soldiering of Diplomatizing the night always at Konigstein and
finally both day and nightquite luxuriously accommodated Bruhl and
he to the very end of this Affair Towards Struppen this is weeks
farther on but we give it hereComte de Broglio Old Broglios elder

fact stood That he was gone without Adieu

And the Dauphiness daughter of those injured Polish Majesties fell
on her knees Pompadour permitting and encouraging at the feet of Most
Christian Majesty on her knees all in passion of tears craved help
and protection to her loved old Mother in the name of Nature and of all
Kings could any King resist And his Pompadour was busy Think of
that noble Empress who calls me COUSIN AND DEAR PRINCESS think of that
insolent Prussian Robber Ah your Majestyand King Louis though
not a hating man did privately dislike Friedrich and evil speeches
of Friedrichs had been reported to him And in short the upshot was
King Louis bound only to 24000 for help of Austria determined to
send and did send above 100000 across the Rhine next Year for that
object as will be seen And all Frenchmenall except Belleisle who
is oldare charmed with these new energetic measures and beautiful new
Austrian connections

Certain it is the Austrians are coming her Imperial Majesty bent with
all her might on relief of those Saxon martyrs which indeed is relief
of herself as she well perceives Courage my friends endure yet a
little Messengers smuggle themselves through the Mountain paths and
go and return though with difficulty

Since September 19th the Correspondence with Polish Majesty has ceased
no persuading of the Polish Majesty Winterfeld went twice to him
conferred at large Bruhl forbidden to be there on the actual
stringencies and urgencies of Fact between the Two Countries but it was
with no result at all Polish Majesty has not the least intention that
Saxony shall be even a Highway for Friedrich if at any time Polish
Majesty can hinder it Neutrality therefore will not do for
Friedrich he demands Alliance practical Partnership and to that his
Polish Majesty is completely abhorrent Diplomatizing may cease nothing
but wrestle of fight will settle this matter

Friedrich able to get nothing from the Sovereign of Saxony is reduced
to grasp Saxony itself and we can observe him doing it always the
closer always the more carefully as the complicacy deepens and the
obstinacy becomes more dangerous and provoking What alternative is
there On first entering Saxony Friedrich had made no secret that he
was not a mere bird of passage there At Torgau there was at once a
FieldCommissariat established with Prussian Officials of eminence to
administer the Military Chest to be deposited there and Torgau to be
put in a state of defence Torgau our Saxon Metropolis of WarFinance
is becoming more and more the Metropolis of Saxon Finance in general
Saxon Officials were liable from the first to be suspended on
Friedrichs order Saxon FinanceOfficials of all kinds were from
the first instructed that till farther notice there must be no
disbursements without King Friedrichs sanction And in fact King
Friedrich fully intends that Saxony is to help him all it can and that
it either will or else shall in this dire pressure of perplexity
which is due in such a degree to the conduct of the Saxon Government for
twelve years past Would Saxony go with him in any form of consent how
much more convenient to Friedrich But Saxony will not Polish Majesty
not himself suffering hunger is obstinate as the decrees of Fate or as
sheep when too much put upon regardless of considerationsand
in fine here is Browne actually afoot coming to relieve Polish
MajestyThe Austrians had uncommonly bestirred themselves

The activity the zeal of all ranks ever since this expedition into
Saxony and clutching of Saxony by the throat contemporary witnesses
declare to have been extraordinary Horses for Piccolominis
Cavalrythey had scarcely got their horses not to speak of training
them not to speak of cannon and the heavier requisites when Schwerin
began marching out of Glatz on Piccolomini As to the cannon for Browne
and him draughtcattle seem absolutely unprocurable Whereupon Maria
Theresa flings open her own Imperial Studs There yoke these to our
cannon let them go their swiftestwhich awoke such an enthusiasm
that noblemen and peasants crowded forward with their coachhorses and
their carthorses to relay Browne all through Bohemia at different
stages and the cannon and equipments move to their places at the
gallop in a manner Archenholtz i 24and even Browne at the
base of the Metal Mountains has got most of his equipments And is
astir towards Pirna Army of 60000 rumor says for relief of the
Saxon martyrs Friedrichs complexities are getting day by day more
stringent

From the middle of September Marshal Keith as was observed with Half
of the Prussians Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick under him has been on
the Bohemian slope of the Metal Mountains securing the roads towns and
passes thereabouts and looking out for the advance of Marshal Browne
from the interior parts Town of Aussig and the Riverroad castle of
Tetschen on its high rock known to Tourists which always needs to be
taken on such occasions these Keith has secured Lies encamped from
Peterswalde to Aussig the middle or main strength of him being in the
Hamlet of Johnsdorf discoverable if readers like there lies Keith
fifteen miles in length like a strap or bar thrown across the back of
that MetalMountain Rangeor part of its back for the range is very
broad and there is much inequality and many troughs big and little
partial and general in the crossing of it A tract which my readers and
I have crossed before now by the Pascopol or Postroad and otherwise
and shall often have to cross

Browne vigorously astir in the interior cannon and equipments coming
by relays at such a pace is daily advancing with his best speed in
the last days of September Browne is encamped at Budin may cross the
Eger River any day and will then be within two marches of Keith His
intentions towards Pirna Country are fixed and sure but the plan
or route he will take is unknown to everybody and indeed to Browne
himself till he see near at hand and consider Brownes problem he
himself knows is abundantly abstrusebordering on the impossible
but he will try his best To get within reach of the Saxons is almost
impossible to Browne even were there no Keith there As good as
impossible altogether by any line of march while Keith is afoot in
those parts By Aussig down the River straight for the interior of
their Camp it is flatly impossible by the south or southeast corner of
their Camp Gottleube way or by the northeast by Schandau way right
bank of Elbe it is virtually soat least without beating Keith
Could one beat Keith indeedbut that will not be easy And that
unluckily is the preliminary to everything

By the HellendorfHennersdorf side in the wastes where Gottleube Brook
gathers itself Browne might have a chance There on that southeast
corner of their Camp were he once there to attack the Prussians from
without while the Saxons burst up from withinthere thinks a good
judge is much the favorablest place But unless Brownes Army had
wings how is it ever to get there Across those MetalMountain ranges
barred by Keithby Aussig with the rocks overhanging Elbe River and
him he cannot go in any case Were there no Keith indeed but there
always is standing ready on the spring one might hold to leftward
and by stolen marches swift far round about

By Schandau region north side of the Elbe is Brownes easiest and
indeed one feasible point of approachno Prussians at present
between him and that the road open though a far circuit northward for
Brownewere he to cross the Elbe in Leitmeritz circle and march with
velocity That too will be difficultnearly impossible in sight of
Keith And were that even done the egress for the Saxons by Schandau
side is through strait mountain gorges intricate steep passes
crossings of the Elbe what force of Saxons or of Austrians will drive
the Prussians from their redoubts and batteries there _OEuvres de
Frederic_ iv 86 93 96

Brownes problem is none of the feasiblest but his orders are strict
Relieve the Saxons at all risks And Browne one of the ablest
soldiers living Your Imperial Majestys best general said the dying
Khevenhuller long since will do his utmost upon it Friedrich does
not think the enterprise very dangerousbeating of Keith the
indispensable preliminary to it but will naturally himself go and look
into it

Tuesday September 28th Friedrich quits Pirna Country by the Prag
Highway making due inspection of his Posts as he goes along and the
outmost of these once past drives rapidly up the Mountains gets with
small escort through Peterswalde on to Johnsdorf that night Does
not think this Keith position good breaks up this Camp of Johnsdorf
bodily next morning and marches down the Mountains direct towards
Browne who we hear is about crossing the Eger his Pontoons now
come at last and will himself be on the advance From Turmitz a poor
mountain hamlet in the hollow of the Hills which is headquarters that
night the march proceeds again Friedrich with the vanguard Army I
think on various countryroads on both hands till all get upon the
Great Road againPragToplitzDresden Postroad which is called
specially in this part of it and loosely in whole The Pascopol and
leads down direct to Budin and Browne

A Pascopol famed in military annals says our Tourist It is a
road with many windings many precipitous sweeps of up and down road
precipitous in structureoffers views to the lover of wild Nature
huge lonesome Hills scattered in the distance waste expanses nearer
hand and futile attempts at moorish agriculture but little else that
is comfortable In times of Peace you will meet at long intervals
some postvehicle struggling forward under melancholy circumstances
some cart or dilapidated mongrel between cart and basket with a lean
ox harnessed to it and scarecrow driver laden with pitcoalwhich
you wish safe home and that the scarecrow were getting warmed by it
But in Wartime the steep road is livelier the common Invasion road
between Saxony and Bohemia whole Armies sweeping over it and their
thousandfold wagons and noises making clangor enough  One of those
Hollows on the Pascopol is Joachimsthal with its old Silver Mines
yielding coins which were in request with traders the silver being
fine Let my ducat be a Joachimsthal one then the old trader would
say a JOACHIMSTHALER or for brevity a THALER whence THALER
and at last DOLLAR almighty and otherwisenow going round the world
Busching _Erdbeschreibung_v 178 Pascopol finishes in Welmina
Township From the last hamlet in Welmina at the neck of the last Hill
step downward one mile holding rather to the left you will come on the
innocent Village of Lobositz its poor cornmills and huckstershops all
peaceably unknown as yet which is soon to become very famous

The Countryroads where Friedrichs Army is on march I should think
are mostly on the mounting hand For here from Turmitz is a trough
again though the last considerable one and on the crest of that we
shall look down upon the Bohemian Plains and the grand Basin of the
Elbethrough various scrubby villages which are not nameworthy
through one called Kletschen which for a certain reason is Crossing
the shoulder of Kletschenberg HILL of this Kletschen which abuts upon
the Pascopolyonder in bright sunshine is your beautiful expansive
Basin of the Elbe and the green Bohemian Plains revealed for a moment
Friedrich snatches his glass not with picturesque object See yonder
is Feldmarschall Browne then In camp yonder down by Lobositz not
ten miles from usit is most true Browne marched this morning long
before the Sun crossed Eger and pitched camp at noonGood thinks
Friedrich And pushes down into the Pascopol into the hollows and minor
troughs which hide Browne henceforth till we are quite near

Quite near through Welmina and a certain final gap of the Hills
Friedrich with the vanguard does emerge an hour before sunset
overhanging Browne not above a mile from the Camp of Browne A very
large Camp that of Brownes flanked to right by the Elbe goes from
Sulowitz through Lobositz to Welhoten close on Elbeand has
properties extremely well worth studying just now Friedrich the Books

Chapter VIBATTLE OF LOBOSITZ

Welminaor ReschniAujest last pertinent of Welmina but we will take
Friedrichs name for it offers to the scrutinizing eye nothing in
our day but some bewildered memory of Alte Fritz clinging obstinately
even to the Peasant mind thereabouts A sleepy littery place some
biggish haggard untrimmed trees some brokenbacked sleepylooking
thatched houses not in contact and each as far as might be with its
back turned on the other and cloaked in its own litter and privacy
Probably no human creature will be visible as you pass through Much
straw lying about chiefly where the few gaunt trees look down on it
cattle glad of any shelter in fact it is mainly an extinct tumult
of straw nothing alive as you pass but a few poor oxen languidly
sauntering up and down finding much to trample little to eat The
Czech Populations were it not for that Question of the Nationalities
are not very beautiful

Close south of this poor Hamlet is a big Hill conspicuous with three
peaks quite at the other base of which a good way down lies Lobositz
the main Village in those parts a place now of assiduous cornmill and
fruit trade and one of the stations on the DresdenPrag Railway This
Hill is what Lloyd calls the Lobosch MajorGeneral Lloyd _History
of the late War in Germany _17561759 3 vols 4to London 1781 i
211 twin to which only flatter is Lloyds Homolka Hill Hill
of RADOSTITZ in more modern Plans and Books Conspicuous Heights and
important to us herethough I did not find the Peasants much know them
under those names By the southern shoulder of this Lobosch Hill runs
the road from Welmina to Lobositz with branches towards many other
villages To your right or southern hand short way southward rises the
other Hill which Lloyd calls Homolka Hill the gap or interval between
Homolka and Lobosch perhaps a furlong in extent is essentially the
PASS through those uplands This pass Friedrich at the first moment
made sure of filling the same with battalions there to bivouac He
likewise promptly laid hold of the two Hills high Lobosch to his left
and lower Homolka to right which precautionary measure it is reckoned
a fault in Browne to have neglected that night fault for which he
smarted on the morrow

From this upland pass or neck between the two Mountains Friedrichs
battalions would have had a fine view had the morning shone for them
Lobositz Leitmeritz Melnick a great fertile Valley or expanse of
fruitful country many miles in breadth and length Elbe like a silver
stripe winding grandly through the finest of all his countries before
ducking himself into the rocktumults of that Pirna district The
mountain gorges of Prag and Moldau River south of Melnick lie hidden
under the horizon or visible only as peaks thirty miles and more to
southeastward a bright country intervening sprinkled with steepled
towns To northwestward far away are the Lausitz Mountains ranked
in loose order but massive making a kind of range and as outposts
to them in their scattered state Hills of good height and aspect are
scattered all about and break the uniformity of the Plain Nowhere in
North Germany could the Prussian battalions have a finer viewif the
morning were fine and if views were their object

The morning first in October was not fine and it was far other than
scenery that the Prussian battalions had in handFriday 1st October
1756 Day should have broken but where is day At seven in the morning
and on till eleven thick mist lay over the plain thin fog to the
very hilltops so that you cannot see a hundred yards ahead Lobositz
is visible only as through a crape farther on nothing but gray sea
under which what the Austrians are doing or whether there are any
Austrians who can say Leftward on the LoboschHill side as we
reconnoitre some Pandours are noticeable nestled in the vineyards
therethat sunward side of the Lobosch is all vineyards belonging
to the different Lobositzers scrubby vineyards all in a brown plucked
state at this season Vineyards parted by low stone walls say three or
four feet high parted by hurdles or by tiny trenches in our day and
the stone walls mere stone facings there are the Pandours crouched
and give fire in a kneeling posture when you approach Lower down near
Lobositz itself flickerings as of Horse squadrons probably Hussar
parties twinkle dubious in the wavering mist Problem wrapt in mist
nothing to be seen and all depends on judging it with accuracy Seven
by the clock Deploy at any rate let us cover our post and be in
readiness for events

Friedrichs vanguard of itself nearly fills that neck or space between
the Lobosch and Homolka Hills He spreads his Infantry and hundred
fieldpieces in part rightwards along the Homolka Hill but chiefly
leftwards along the Lobosch where their nearest duty is to drive off
those Pandours Always as a new battalion pushing farther leftward
comes upon its ground the Pandours give fire on itand it on the
Pandours till the Left Wing is complete and all the Lobosch is in
this manner a crackling of Pandour musketry and antimusketry Right
Wing steady to its guns on the Homolka has as yet nothing to do Those
wings of Infantry are two lines deep the Cavalry in three lines is
between them in the centre no room for Cavalry elsewhere except on the
outskirts some fringing of light horse to be ready for emergencies

The Pandour firing except for the noise of it does not amount to much
they can take no aim says Lloyd crouching behind their stone fences
and the Prussian Battalions steadily pushing downwards trample out
their sputtering and clear the Lobosch of them to a safe distance
But the ground is intricate so wrapt in mist for the present That
crackling lasts for hours decisive of nothing and the mist also and
ones anxious guessings and scrutinizings lasts in a wavering fitful
manner

Once for some time in the wavering of the mist there was seen down
in the plain opposite our centre a body of Cavalry Horse for certain
say ten squadrons of them or 1500 Horse continually manoeuvring
changing shape now in more ranks now in fewer sometimes
checkerwise formed like a draughtboard shooting out wings they
career about one sees not whither or vanish again into the mist
behind Brownes rearguard this that we are come upon thinks
Friedrich these squatted Pandours backed by Horse must be his
rearguard that are amusing us Browne and the Army are off crossing
the Elbe hastening towards the Schandau the Pirna quarter while we
stand bickering and idly sputtering hereWeary of such idle business
Friedrich orders forward Twenty of his Squadrons from the centre
station Charge me those Austrian Horse and let us finish this The
Twenty Squadrons preceded by a pair of fieldpieces move down hill
storm in upon the Austrian party storm it furiously into the mist are
furiously chasing itwhen unexpected cannonbatteries destructive
caseshot awaken on their left flank batteries from Lobositz one may
guess and force them to draw back To draw back with some loss and
rank again in an indignantly blown condition at the foot of their
Hill Indignant after brief breathing they try it once more

Dont try it Friedrich had sent out to tell them for the mist
was clearing and Friedrich on the higher ground saw new important
phenomena but it was too late For the Twenty Squadrons are again
dashing forward sweeping down whatever is before them in spite of
cannonvolleys they plunge deeper and deeper into the mist come upon
a ditch twelve feet broad big swampy drain such as are still found
there grassgreen in summertime clear said ditch forward still
deeper into the mist and after three hundred yards come upon a second
far worse ditch plainly impassable this oneditch they call it
though it is in fact a vile sedgy Brook oozing along there the MORELL
BACH considerable Brook lazily wandering towards Lobositz where it
disembogues in rather swifter fashionand are saluted with cannon
from the farther side and see serried ranks under the gauze of mist
Brownes Army in fact The Twenty Squadrons have to recoil out of
shotrange the faster the better with a loss of a good many men in
those two charges Friedrich orders them up Hill again much regretful
of this second charge which he wished to hinder and posts them to
rearwardwhere they stand silent the unconscious stoicphilosophers
in buff and have little farther service through the rest of the day

It is now 11 oclock the mist all clearing off and Friedrich before
that second charge had a growing view of the Plain and its condition
Beyond question there is Browne not in retreat by any means but in
full array numerous and his position very strong Ranked unattackable
mostly behind that oozy Brook or BACH of Morell which has only two
narrow Bridges cannon plenty on both one Bridge from the south parts
to Sulowitz OUR road to Sulowitz and it would be by Radostitz and
the Homolka and then one other Bridge connecting Sulowitz with
Lobositzwhich latter is Brownes own Bridge uniting right wing and
left of Browne so to speak and is still more unattackable in the
circumstances What will Friedrich decide on attempting

That oozy Morell Brook issues on Brownes side of Lobositz cutting
Browne in two but is otherwise all in Brownes favor Browne
extends through Lobositz and beyond it curves up to Welhoten on
the Riverbrink at Lobositz are visible considerable redoubts
cannonbatteries and much regular infantry Browne will be difficult to
force yonder in the Lobositz part but yonder alone can he be tried
He is pushing up more Infantry that way conscious probably of that
factand that the Lobosch Hill is not his but anothers What would
not Browne now give for the Lobosch Hill Yesternight he might have had
it gratis in a manner and indeed did try slightly with his Pandour
people durst not at greater expensewho have now ceased sputtering
and cower extinct in the lower vineyards there Browne at any rate
is rapidly strengthening his right wing which has hold of Lobositz
pushing forward in that quarterwhere the Brook withal is of firmer
bottom and more wadable Thither too is Friedrich bent So that Lobositz
is now the key of the Battle there will the tug of war now be

Friedrichs cavalry is gone all to rearward His right wing holds the
Homolka Hillthat too would now be valuable to Browne and cannot be
had gratis as yesternight Friedrichs left wing is on the Lobosch
Pandours pretty well extinct before it but now from Welhoten quarter
new Regulars coming on thitheras if Browne would still take the
Lobosch Which would be victory to him but is not now possible to
Browne Nor will long seem soFriedrich having other work in view for
himmeaning now to take Lobositz instead of losing the Lobosch to
him Friedrich pushes out his Left Wing still farther leftward leftward
and downward withal to clear those vineyardfences completely of
their occupants Pandour or Regular old or new This is done the
vineyardfences sweptand the sweepings driven in a more and more
stormy fashion towards Welhoten and Lobositz the Lobosch falling quite
desperate for Browne

Henceforth Friedrich directs all his industry to taking Lobositz
Browne to the defending of it which he does with great vigor and
fire his batteries redoubts doing their uttermost and his battalions
rushing on mass of them after mass at quick march obstinate fierce
to a degree in the height of temper and showing such fight as we never
had of them before Friedrichs Left Wing and Brownes Right now have it
to decide between themany attempt Browne makes with his Left through
Sulowitz as he once did and once only is instantly repressed by
cannon from the Homolka Hill And the rest of the Battle or rather the
Battle itselffor all hitherto has been pickeering and groping in the
mistmay be made conceivable in few words

Friedrich orders the second line of his Left Wing to march up and join
with the first Right Wing shoving ITS two lines into one is now to
cover the Lobosch as well Left Wing in condensed condition shall
fall down on Lobositz and do its best They are now clear of the
vineyardworks the ground is leveller though still slopinga three
furlongs from the Village and somewhat towards the Elbe when Brownes
battalions first came extensively to close grips fierce enough as was
said the toughest wrestle yet had with those Austrianscoming on
with steady fury under such force of cannon with iron ramrods too
and improved ways like our own But nothing could avail them the
counterfury being so great They had to go at the Welhoten part and
even to runplunging into Elbe a good few of them and drowning there in the
vain hope to swim Never have my troops says Friedrich done such
miracles of valor cavalry as well as infantry since I had the honor to
command them By this deadlift achievement TOUR DE FORCE I have seen

In fine after some three hours more of desperate tugging and
struggling cannon on both sides going at a great rate and infinite
musketry ninety cartridges a man on our Prussian side and ammunition
falling done not without bayonetpushings and smitings with the butt
of your musket the Austrians are driven into Lobositz are furiously
pushed there and in spite of new battalions coming to the rescue
are fairly pushed through These Villagestreets are too narrow for
new battalions from Browne much of the Village should have been burnt
beforehand say cool judges And now sure enough it does get burnt
Lobositz is now all on fire by Prussian industry So that the Austrians
have to quit it instantly and rush off in great disorder key of the
Battle or Battle itself quite lost to them

The Prussian infantry led by the Duke of BrunswickBevern Governor of
Stettin one of the DukeFerdinand cousinry frugal and valiant gave
the highest satisfaction seldom was such firing such furious pushing
they had spent ninety cartridges a man were at last quite out of
cartridges so that Bevern had to say Strike in with bayonets MEINE
KINDER buttends or what we have HERAN Our Grenadiers were mainly
they that burnt Lobositz How salutary now would it have been says
Epimetheus Lloyd had Browne had a small battery on the other side of
the Elbe whereby he might have taken them in flank and shorn them
into the wind Epimetheus marks this battery on his Plan and is wise
behindhand at a cheap rate

Brownes Right Wing and probably his Army with it would have gone much
to perdition now that Lobositz was become Prussianhad not Browne
in the nick of the moment made a masterly movement pushed forward
his Centre and Left Wing numerous battalions still fresh to interpose
between the chasing Prussians and those fugitives The Prussians
infantry only cannot chase on such terms the Prussian cavalry we
know is far rearward on the high ground Browne retires a mile
or twosouthward Budinwardnot chased and there halts and
rearranges himself thinking what farther he will do His aim in
fighting had only been to defend himself and in that humble aim he has
failed Chase of the Prussians over that HomolkaLobosch country with
the high grounds rearward and the Metal Mountains in their hands he
could in no event have attempted

The question now is Will he go back to Budin or will he try
farther towards Schandau Nature points to the former course in such
circumstances Friedrich by way of assisting does a thing much
admired by Lloyddetaches Bevern with a strong party southward out
of Lobositz which is now his to lay hold of Tschirskowitz lying
Budinward but beyond the Budin Road Which feat when Browne hears
of it means to him Going to cut me off from Budin then From my
ammunitionstores from my very breadcupboard And he marches that
same midnight silently in good order back to Budin He is not much
ruined nay the Prussian loss is numerically greater 3308 killed and
wounded on the Prussian side on the Austrian 2984 with three cannon
taken and two standards Not ruined at all but foiled frustrated and
has to devise earnestly What next Once rearranged he may still try

The Battle lasted seven hours the last four of it very hot till
Lobositz was won and lost It was about 5 PM when Browne fired his
retreatcannoncannon happened to be loaded say the AnecdoteBooks
mythically given now and then Friedrich wearied enough had flung
himself into his carriage for a moments rest or thankful reflection
and of all places the ball of the retreatcannon lighted THERE Between
Friedrichs feet as he lay recliningsay the AnecdoteBooks whom
nobody is bound to believe

On the strength of those two Prussian charges which had retired from
caseshot on their flank and had not wings for getting over sedge and
ooze Austria pretended to claim the victory Two charges repelled by
our gallant horse Lobositz indeed was got on fire and we had nothing
for it but to withdraw but we took a new position and only left
that for want of waterwith the like excuses Essentially a clear
victory said the Austrians and sang TEDEUM about itbut profited
nothing by that piece of melody The fact considerable or not was
from the first too undeniable Browne beaten from the field And beaten
from his attempt too the Saxons not relievable by this method and
lies quiet in Budin againwith his water sure to him but what other
advantages gained

Here are two Letters brief both which we may as well read

the Alliance with YOU which we had been used to for sixteen years
strictly for twelve though in substance ever since 1740 and which
was by nature advantageous to us But if my advice were asked just now
I should answer That the said method being now impossible we are in
the case of a ships captain who defends himself the best he can and
when all resources are exhausted has rather than surrender on shameful
conditions to fire the powdermagazine and blow up his ship You
remember that of your Francois IFORS LHONNEUR ah yes very

Prussians lay in their Camp of Lobositz posted up and down in that

Chapter VIITHE SAXONS GET OUT OF PIRNA ON DISMAL TERMS

The disaster of October 1stfor which they were trying to sing TEDEUMS
at Viennafell heavier on the poor Saxons in their cage at Pirna
Alas where is our deliverance now Friedrichs people in their lines
here gave them such a joyfiring for Lobositz as Retzow has seldom
heard huge volleyings salvoings runningfires starting out
artistically timed and stationed thunderous high and borne by the
echoes gloomily reverberative into every dell and labyrinth of the
Pirna Countryintended to strike a deeper damp into them thinks he
Retzow i 67 But Imperial Majesty was mindful too and straightway
sent Browne positive order Deliver me these poor Saxons at any price
And in the course of not quite a week from Lobositz there arrives a
confidential Messenger from Browne Courage still ye caged Saxons I
will try it another way Only you must hold out till the 11th on the
11th stand to your tools and it shall be done

Browne is to take a succinct Detachment 8000 picked men horse and
foot to make a wider sweep with these well eastward by the foot of
Lausitz Hills and far enough from all Prussian parties and scouts
to march with all speed and silence through BohmLeipa Kamnitz
Rumburg Schluckenau and come in upon the Schandau region quite from
the northeast side say at Lichtenhayn an eligible Village which is
but seven miles or so from the Konigstein with the chasmy country
and the river intervening Monday October 11th Browne will arrive at
Lichtenhayn sixty miles of circling march from Budin privately post
himself near Lichtenhayn Prussian posts of no great strength lying
ahead of him there You indignant extenuated Saxons are to get
yourselves acrossnear the Konigstein it will have to be under cover
of the Konigsteins cannonon the front or riverward side of those
same Prussian posts crossingplace Brownes Messenger settles can
be Thurmsdorf Hamlet opposite the Lilienstein opposite the Hamlets of
Ebenheit and Halbstadt there Konigstein fire will cover your bridge and
your building of it

Monday night next I say post yourselves there with hearts resolute
with powder dry there about the eastern roots of the Lilienstein
beautiful Show Mountain with stairsteps cut on it for Tourist people
by August the Strong and avoid the Prussian battery and abatis which
is on it just now You at Ebenheit I at Lichtenhayn trimmed and braced
for action through that Monday night Tuesday morning the Konigstein
at your beckoning shall fire two cannonshots which shall mean All
ready here Then forward you on those Prussian posts by the front
I will attack them by the rear With right fury both of us I am
told they are but weak in those posts surely by double impetus and
deadlift effort from us both they CAN be forced Only force themyou
are in the open field again and you march away with me colors flying
your hungercage and all your tribulations left behind you


This is Brownes plan The poor Saxons acceptwhat choice have
theythough the question of crossing and bridgebuilding has its
intricacies and that inevitable item of postponement till the 11th
is a sore clause to them for not only are there short and ever shorter
rations but grim famine itself is advancing with large strides The
daily twenty ounces of meal has sunk to half that quantity the ounce
or so of butchersmeat once a week has vanished or become HORSE of
extreme leanness The cavalry horses have not tasted oats nothing but
hay or straw not even water always the artillery horses had to
live by grazing brown leaves their main diet latterly Not horses any
longer but walking trestles poor animals And the menwell they are
fallen pale but they are resolute as ever The nine cornmills which
they have in this circuit of theirs grind now night and day and all
the cavalry are set to thresh whatever grain can be found about no
hind or husbandman shall retain one sheaf in this way they hope utter
hunger may be staved off and the great attempt made PRECIS DE

Browne skilfully and perfectly did his part of the Adventure Browne
arrives punctually at Lichtenhayn evening of the 11th bivouacs hidden
in the Woods thereabouts in cold damp weather stealthily reconnoitres
the Prussian Villages ahead and trims himself for assault at sound
of the two cannons tomorrow But there came no cannonsignal on the
morrow far other signallings and messagings tomorrow and next
day and next from the Konigstein and neighborhood Wait Excellency
Feldmarschall writes Bruhl to him Note after Note instead of
signalling from the Konigstein do wait a very little You run no
risk in waiting we even if we MUST yield will make that our first
stipulation YOU will grumbles Browne and waits naturally with
extreme impatience But the truth is the Adventure on the Saxon side
of it has already altogether misgone and becomes from this point
onwards a mere series of failures futilities and disastrous miseries
tragical to think of Worth some record here since there are
Documents abundantespecially as Feldmarschall Rutowski who is
GeneralinChief an old not esteemed friend of ours has produced or
caused to be produced a Narrative which illuminates the Business
from within as well PRECIS c just cited compare TAGEBUCH DER
EINSCHLIESSUNG DES SACHSISCHEN LAGERS BEY PIRNA Diary c which is
the Prussian Account in Seyfarth BEYLAGEN ii 2248 The latter is
our main Document here

I know not how much of the blame was General Rutowskis one could
surmise some laxity of effort and a rather slovenlysurvey of facts in
that quarter The Enterprise from the first was flatly impossible say
judges and it is certain poor Rutowskis execution was not firstrate
How get across the Elbe Rutowski had said to himself perhaps not
quite with the due rigor of candor proportionate to the rigorous fact
How get across the Elbe We have copper pontoons at Pirna but they
will be difficult to cart Or we might have a boatbridge boats planked
together two and two At Pirna are plenty of boats and by oar and
trackrope the River itself might be a road for them Boats or pontoons
to Konigstein by water or land they must be got Eight miles of
abysmal roads our horses all extenuated Impossible to cart these
pontoons said Rutowski to himselfPity he had not tried it He had
a week to do those eight bad miles in and 2000 lean horses picking
grass or brown leaves while their riders threshed We will drag our
pontoons by water by the Elbe towpath thought Rutowski that
will be easierand forthwith sets about preparing for it secretly
collecting boats at Pirna steersmen towingmen bridgetackle and what
else will be necessary

Rutowski made at least no delay Brownes messenger we find had come
to him Thursday 7th and on Friday night Rutowski has a squad of
boatmen steersmen and twoscore of towing peasants ready and
actually gets under way They are escorted by the due battalions with
fieldpieceswho are to fire upon the Prussian batteries and keep up
such a blaze of musketry and heavier shot as will screen the boats in
passing Surely a ticklish operation thisarguing a sanguine temper
in General Rutowski The south bank of the River is ours but there are
various Prussian batteries three of them very strong along the north
bank which will not fail to pelt us terribly as we pass No help for
itwe must trust in luck Here is the sequel with dates adjusted

ELBE RIVER NIGHT OF OCTOBER 8th9th Friday night accordingly so
soon as Darkness unusually dark this night has dropt her veil on the
business Rutowski sets forth The Prussian battery or bridgehead
TETEDEPONT at Pirna has not noticed him so silent was he But
alas the other batteries do not fail to notice to give fire and in
fact on being answered and finding it a serious thing to burst out
into horrible explosion unanswerable by the Saxon fieldpieces
and surely perilous to human nature steering and towing those big
RiverBoats Loyal to our King and full of pity for him that are
webut towing at a rate say of two shillings per head Before long
the forty towing peasants fling down their ropes first one then more
then all in spite of efforts promises menaces and vanish among the
thicketsforfeiting the two shillings on view of imminent death
Soldiers take the towingropes try to continue it a little but now the
steersmen also manage to call halt We wont Let us out let us out
We will steer you aground on the Prussian shore if you dont making
night hideous And the towing enterprise breaks down for that bout
double barges mooring on the Saxon shore I know not precisely at what
point nor is it material

SATURDAY NIGHT OCTOBER 9th10th New boatmen forty new towmen have
been hired at immense increase of wages say four shillings for the
night but have you much good probability my General that even for
that high guerdon imminence of death can be made indifferent to towmen
No you have nt The matter goes this night precisely as it did last
towmen vanishing in the horrible cannon tumult steersmen shrieking We
will ground you on the Prussian shore very soldiers obliged to give it
up and General Rutowski himself obliged to wash his hands of it as
a thing that cannot be done In fact a thing which need not have been
tried had Rutowski been rigorously candid with himself and his hopes
as the facts now prove to be Twentyfour hours lost by this bad
business says he thirtysix as I count or to take it rigorously
fortyeight even and now Sunday morning instead of Friday at what
in sad truth is metaphorically the eleventh hour Rutowski has to
bethink him of his copper pontoons and make the impossible carting
method possible in a days time or do worse

SUNDAY MONDAY OCTOBER 10th11th By unheardof exertions all hands
and all spenthorses now at a deadlift effort night and day Rutowski
does get his pontoons carted out of the Pirna storehouse lands them
at Thurmsdorfopposite the Liliensteina mile or so short of
Konigstein where his Bridge shall be It is now the 11th at night And
our pontoons are got to the ground nothing more Every man of us at
this hour should have been across and trimming himself to climb with
bayonet fixed Browne is ready expecting our signalshot to storm in
on his side And our bridge is not built only the pontoons here All
things went perverse adds Rutowski for farther comfort we Saxon
HomeArmy had with us except Officers only Four Pontoniers or
trained Bridgebuilders all the rest are at Warsaw sad thought but
too late to think it

TUESDAY TILL WEDNESDAY EARLY 12th13th Bridge the Four Pontoniers
with Officers and numb soldiers doing their best is got builtBrowne
waiting for us on thorns all day Prussians extensively beginning to
strengthen their posts about the Lilienstein about Lichtenhayn or
where risk is and in fact pouring across to that northern side quite
aware of Rutowski and Browne

That same night 12th13th while the Bridge was struggling to complete
itselfrain now falling and tempests broken outthe Saxon Army
from Pirna down to Hennersdorf had lifted itself from its Lines and
got under way towards Thurmsdorf and the crossingplace Dark night
plunging rain all the elements in uproar The worst roads in Nature
now champed doubly such roads as never any Army marched on before
Most of their cannon are left standing a few they had tried to yoke
broke down and choked up the narrow road altogether so that the
cavalry had to dismount and lead their horses by sidepathsfigure
what sidepaths Distance to Thurmsdorf from any point of the Saxon
Lines cannot be above six miles but it takes them all that night and
all next day Such a march as might fill the heart with pity Oh ye
Rutowskis Bruhls though never so decorated by twelve tailors what
a sight ye are at the head of men Dark night wild raging weather
labyrinthic roads worn kneedeep It is broad daylight Wednesday 13th
and only the vanguard is yet got across trailing a couple of cannons
and splashes about endeavoring to take rank there in spite of wet and
hunger rain still pouring wind very high

Nothing of Browne comes this Wednesday but from the opposite
GrossSedlitz and Gottleube side the Prussians are coming This
morning at daylight struck by symptoms the Prussians mounted our
empty redoubts they are now in full chase of us Ziethen with Hussars
as vanguard A difficult bit of marching even Ziethen and his light
people find it sprawling forward at their cheeriest with daylight
to help and in chase not chased through such intricacies of rock and
mud Ziethens company did not assist the Saxons They wheel round show
fight and there is volleying and bickering all day the Saxon march
getting ever more perturbed Nearly all the baggage has to be left
Ziethen takes into the woods near Thurmsdorf giving fire as the poor
wet Saxons now much in a pellmell condition pass to their Bridge

Dreadful weather for Browne in his bivouac and wearisome waiting
with Prussians and perils accumulating on him Browne was ill of lungs
coughing much lodging in these violent tempests on the cold ground
A right valiant soldier and man as does appear the flower of all the
Irish Brownes though they have quite forgotten him in our time and of
all those Irish Exiles then tragically spending themselves in Austrian
quarrels You saw the great man says one who seems to have been
present how he sacrificed himself to this Enterprise What Austrian
Fieldmarshal but himself would ever have lowered his loftiness to lead
in person so insignificant a Detachment merely for the public good
I have seen staffofficers distinguished only by their sasheries and
insignia who would not have stirred to inspect a vedette without 250
men Our Fieldmarshal was of another turn Sharing with his troops all
the hardships none excepted of these critical days and in spite of a
violent cough which often brought the visible blood from his lungs and
had quite worn him down exposing himself like the meanest of the Army
to the tempests of rainy weather Think what a sight it was going to
your very heart and summoning you to endurance of every hardshipthat
evening not said which when the Fieldmarshal worn out with his
fatigues and his disorder sank out of faintingfits into a sleep The
ground was his bed and the storm of clouds his coverlid In crowds his
brave warcomrades gathered round stripped their cloaks their coats
and strove in noble rivalry which of them should have the happiness to
screen the Father of the Army at their own cost of exposure and by
any device keep the pelting of the weather from that loved head

There is a picture for you in the heights of Lichtenhayn as you steam
past Schandau in contemplative mood and perhaps think of Justice to
Ireland among other sad thoughts that rise

From Thurmsdorf to the PontoonBridge there was a kind of road down
which the Saxons scrambled yesterday and by painful degrees got
wriggled across But on the other shore forward to the Hamlets of
Halbstadt and Ebenheit there is nothing but a steep slippery footpath
figure what a problem for the 14000 in such weather Then at
Ebenheit close behind Brownewards were Browne now there rises the
Lilienstein abrupt rocky mountain its slopes on both hands washed
by the River River making its first elbow here closely girdling this
Lilienstein on both these slopes are Prussian batteries each with its
abatis needing to be stormedthat will be your first operation
Abatis and slopes of the Lilienstein once stormed you fall into a
valley or hollow raked again by Prussian batteries and will have to
mount still storming out of the valley skyhigh across the Ziegenruck
GOATSBACK ridge that is your second preliminary operation After
which you come upon the work itself namely the Prussian redoubts at
Lichtenhayn and 12000 men on them by this time A modern Tourist says

From the Konigstein to Pirna Elbe if serpentine is like a serpent
rushing at full speed Just past the Konigstein the Elbe from
westward as its general course is turns suddenly to northward runs so
for a mile and a half then just before getting to the BASTEI at
Raden turns suddenly to westward again and so continues Tourists
know Radenwhere the Prussians have just fished out a Bridge for
themselveswith the BASTEI high aloft to west of it The Old Inn
hospitable though sleepless stands pleasantly upon the Riverbrink
overhung by high cliffs close on its left side or in the intricacies
to rear of it are huts and houses sprinkled about as if burrowed in
the sandstone more comfortably than you could expect The site is a
narrow dell narrow chasm with labyrinthic chasms branching off from
it narrow and gloomy as seen from the River but opening out even into
cornfields as you advance inwards work of a small Brook which is still
industriously tinkling and gushing there and has in PreAdamite times
been a lake and we know not what NiederRaden this on the north side
of the River of OberRaden on the south side there is nothing visible
from your Inn windowsnor have we anything to do with it farther

Bruhl and the Polish Majesty safe enough they and snug in the
Konigstein are clear for advancing Die like soldiers for your King
and Country writes Polish Majesty Thursday two in the morning
that also Rutowski reads and I think still other Royal Autographs sent
as Postscripts to that From the Konigstein they duly fire off the two
Cannonshot as signal that we are coming signal which Browne just in
the act of departing never heard owing to the piping of the winds and
rattling of the rain Advance my heroes counsel they You cannot
drag your ammunitions say you your poor couple of big guns Here are
his Majestys own royal horses for that serviceand in effect the
royal stud is heroically flung open in this pressure and a splashing
column of sleek quadrupeds 150 royal draughthorses early in the
forenoon Gotzinger p 156 swim across to Ebenheit accordingly if
that could encourage And about noon there is strong cannonading from
the Konigstein as signal to Browne who is off Polish Majesty looking
with his spyglass in an astonished manner In Vain Rutowski and his
Council of Warsitting wet in a hut of Ebenheit with 14000 starved
men outside who have stood seventytwo hours of rain for one itemsee
nothing for it but surrender on such terms as we can get

In fact independently of weather and circumstances the Enterprise
says Friedrich was radically impossible nobody that had known the
ground could have judged it other Rutowski had not known it then
Browne never pretended to know it Rutowski was not candid with the
conditions the conditions never known nor candidly looked at and
THEY are now replying to him with candor enough From the first his
Enterprise was a final flicker of false hope going out as here by
spasm in the rigors of impossibility and flat despair

That column of royal horses sent splashing across the Riverthat was
the utmost of selfsacrifice which I find recorded of his Polish Majesty
in this matter He was very obstinate his Bruhl and he were But his
conduct was not very heroic That royal Autograph General Rutowski
and ye true Saxons attack these Prussian lines then sell your lives
like men not like Bruhl and me must have fallen cold on the heart
after seventytwo hours of rain Rutowskis wet Council of War in the
hut at Ebenheit rain still pouring answers unanimously That it were
a leading of men to the butchery that there is nothing for it but
surrender Bruhl and Majesty can only answer Welladay it must be
so then

Winterfeld Prussian Commander hereabouts grants Armistice grants
liberal wagonloads of bread first of all terms of Capitulation to be
settled at Struppen tomorrow

FRIDAY OCTOBER 15th Rutowski goes across to Struppen the late Saxon
headquarter now FriedrichsFriday gone a fortnight was the day
of Lobositz Winterfeld and he are the negotiators there Friedrich
ratifying or refusing by marginal remarks The terms granted are hard
enough but they must be accepted First preliminary of all terms has
already been accepted a gift of bread to these poor Saxons their
haversacks are empty their cartridgeboxes drowned it has rained on
them three days and nights Last upshot of all terms is still well known
to everybody That the 14000 Saxons are compelled to become Prussian
and forced to volunteer

That had been Friedrichs determination and reading of his rights in
the matter now that hard had come to hard You refused all terms you
have resisted to death or deathsDOOR and are now at discretion
Of the question What is to be done with those Saxons Friedrich
had thought a great deal first and last and had found it very
intricateas readers too will if they think of it Prisoners of
Warto keep them locked up with trouble and expense in that fashion
They can never be exchanged Saxony has now nothing to exchange them
with and Austria will not Their obstinacy has had costs to me who of
us can count what costs In short they shall volunteer

Never did I for my poor part authorize such a thing loudly
asseverated Rutowski afterwards And indeed the Capitulation is not
precise on that interesting point A lengthy Document and not worth
the least perusal otherwise we condense it into three Articles all
grounding on this general Basis not deniable by Rutowski The Saxon
Army being at such a pass ready to die of hunger if we did NOT lift
our finger has so to speak become our property and we grant it the
following terms

1 Kettledrums standards and the like insignia and matters of
honorcarry these to the Konigstein with my regretful respects to
his Polish Majesty Konigstein to be a neutral Fortress during this War
Polish Majesty at perfect liberty to go to Warsaw as he on the instant
now did and never returned

2 Officers to depart on giving their parole Not to serve against us
during this War Parole given nothing like too well kept

3 Rest of the Army with all its equipments munitions soul and body
so to speak is to surrender utterly and be ours as all Saxony shall
for the present be In _HeldenGeschichte _iii 920928 at full
lengthwith Briedrichs MARGINALIA noticeably brief

That is in sum the Capitulation of Struppen Nothing articulate in it
about the one now interesting pointand in regard to that I can only
fancy Rutowski might interject interrogatively perhaps at some
length Our soldiers to be Prisoners of War then Prisoners yes
clearlyunless they choose to volunteer and have a better fate
Prisoners can volunteer They are at discretion they would die if we
did NOT lift our finger thus I suppose Winterfeld would rejoin if
necessaryand that in the WinterfeldRutowski Conferences the thing
had probably been kept in a kind of CHIAROSCURO by both parties

Very certain it is Sunday 17th October 1756 Capitulation being
signed the night before Friedrich goes across at NiederRaden where
the Pilgrim of the Picturesque now climbs to see the BASTEI where the
Prussians have by this time a Bridge thrown together out of those
Pontoonsgoes across at NiederRaden up that chasmy Pass rides to
the Heights of Waltersdorf in the opener country behind and pauses
there while the captive Saxon Army defiles past him laying down its
arms at his feet Unarmed and now under Prussian word of command
these ExSaxon soldiers go on defiling march through by that Chasm
of NiederRaden cross to OberRaden and in the plainer country
thereabouts arein I know not what length of hours but in an
incredibly short length so swift is the managementchanged wholly into
Prussian soldiers obliged to volunteer every one of them

That is the fact fact loudly censured fact surely questionableto
what intrinsic degree I at this moment do not know Fact much
blamable before the loose public of mankind upon which I leave men to
their verdict It is not a fact which invites imitation as we shall
see Fact how accomplished by what methods that would be the question
with me but even that is left dark The horse regiments three of
heavy horse he broke and distributed about a good few in his own
GardeduCorps Three other horse regiments were in Poland the sole
Saxon Army now leftof whom at least of one man among whom we may
happen to hear Ten foot regiments what was reckoned a fault he
left together in Prussian uniform with Prussian Officers They were
scattered up and down put in garrisons not easy handling them they
deserted by whole companies at a time in the course of this War
Preuss ii 22 135 in Stenzel v 1620 more precise details Not
a measure for imitation as we saidHow Friedrich defended such hard
conduct to the Saxons Reader I know only that Destiny and Necessity
urged on by Saxons and others was hard as adamant upon Friedrich at
this time and that Friedrich did not the least dream of making any
defenceand will have to take your verdict such as it may be

Moritz of Dessau had a terrible Winter of it organizing and breaking
in these Saxon peoplegot by pressgang in this way Polish Majesty
with 500 of suite had driven instantly for Warsaw posthorses most
politely furnished him and all the Prussian posts and soldiers well
kept out of his roadroad chosen for him to that end Poor soul
he never came back For six years coming he saw from Warsaw in the
distance amid anarchy and NIEPOZWALAM which he never lacked there
the wide War raging in Saxony especially and died soon after it was
done Nor did Bruhl return except broken by that event and to die
in few months after Let us pity the poor fatgoose of a Majesty
not illnatured at all only stupid and idle some pity even to the
doomedphantasm Bruhl if you canand thank Heaven to have got done
with such a pair

Friedrichs treatment of the Saxon Troops Saxon Majesty and Country
who shall say that it was wise in all points It would be singular
treatment if it were In all things AFTER is so different from
BEFORE and DURING The truth is Friedrich hoped long to have made some
agreement with the Saxons And readers now in the universal silence
have no notion of Friedrichs complexities from fact and of the
loud howl of hostile rumor which was piping through all journals
diplomacies and foreign human throats against him at that time

The essential passages of War and Peace says a certain Commentator
during those Five weeks of Pirna can be made intelligible in small
compass But how the world argued of them then and afterwards and rang
with hot Gazetteer and Diplomatic logic from side to side no reader
will now ever know A worldtornado extinct gonethink of the sounds
uttered from human windpipes shrill with rage some of them hoarse

through the afflicted Universe in general for certain years The very

Pirna was no sooner done than Friedrich returned to the Camp at
Lobositz where his victorious KeithArmy has been lying all this
while The Camp of Lobositz and all Camps Prussian and Austrian are
about to strike their tents and proceed to Winterquarters to prepare
against next Spring Friedrich set off thither October 18th the very
day after that of Waltersdorf with intent to bring home Keiths Army
and see if Browne meant anything farther which Browne did not or does
only in the small Tolpatch way also to meet Schwerin whom he had
summoned over from Silesia for a little conference there Schwerin

Chapter VIIIWINTER IN DRESDEN

The Saxon Army is incorporated then its King gone under the horizon
the Saxon Country has a Prussian Board set over it to administer all
things of Government especially to draw taxes and recruits from Saxony
Torgau seat of this new Board has got fortified 1500 inhabitants
were requisitioned as spademen for that end at first with
wageslatterly I almost fear without

The Saxon Ministers are getting drilled cashiered if necessary and on
all hands rigorous methods going forwardtill Saxony is completely
under grasp in which state it was held very tight indeed for the six
years coming There is no detailing of all that details were they even
known to an Editor at such distance would weary every reader Enough to
understand that Friedrich has not on this occasion as he did in 1744
omitted to disarm Saxony to hobble it in every limb and have it
at discretion tied as with ropes to his interests and him
_HeldenGeschichte _iii 945956 His management was never accounted
cruel and it was studiously the reverse of violent or irregular but it
had to be rigorous as the facts werenor was it the worst or reckoned
the worst of Saxonys miseries in this time

Poor Country suffering for its Bruhl In the Country except for its
Bruhl there was no sin against Prussia the reverse rather The Saxon
population as Protestants have no goodwill to Austria and its aims
of aggrandizement In Austrian spyletters now and afterwards they are
described to us as GUT PREUSSISCH strong for Prussia the most of
them even in Dresden itself

Whether Friedrich could have had much real hope to end the War this
Year or scare it off from beginning may be a question If he had it
is totally disappointed The Saxon Government has brought ruin on itself
and Country but it has been of great damage to Friedrich Would Polish
Majesty have consented to disband his soldiers and receive Friedrich
with a BONAFIDE Neutrality Friedrich could have passed the
Mountains still in time for a heavy stroke on Bohemia which was totally
unprepared for such a visit And he mightfrom the Towers of Prag for
instancehave far more persuasively held out the olivebranch to
an astonished EmpressQueen Leave me alone Madam will you then
Security for that I wanted and want nothing more But Polish Majesty
taking on him the character of Austrian martyr and flinging himself
into the gulf has prevented all that has turned all that the other
way

Austria it appears is quite ungrateful Was nt he bound thinks
Austriaas its wont rather is Forgetful of the great deliverance
wrought for it by poor Polish Majesty whom it could not deliverexcept
into bottomless wreck Austria grateful or not stands unscathed has
time to prepare its Armaments its vocal Arguments Austria is in higher
provocation than ever and its very Arguments highly vocal to the Reich
and the world Is not this man a robber and enemy of mankind do
Friedrich a great deal of ill Friedrichs sudden Campaign instead of
landing him in the heart of the Austrian States there to propose Peace
has kindled nearly all Europe into flames of rage against himwhich
will not consist in words merely Never was misunderstanding of a man
at a higher pitch Such treatment of a peaceable Neighbor and Crowned
Headwitness it ye Heavens and thou Earth Dauphiness falling on her
knees to Most Christian Majesty Princess and dearest Sister to Most
Christian Majestys Pompadour especially no end of Pleading to the
German Reich in a furious DelphicPythoness or quasiinspired tone
all this goes on

From the time when Pirna was blockaded Kaiser Franz his high Consort
and sense of duty urging him has been busy in the ReichsHofrath kind
of PrivyCouncil or Supreme Court of the Reich which sits at Vienna
busy there and in the Reichs Diet at Regensburg busy everywhere with
utmost diligence over Teutschlandforging Reich thunder Manifestoes

few ages past Thunderbolt thought to be gone mainly to rust by the
judicious

which however the poor old Reich did grasp again and attempt to
launch As perhaps we shall have to notice by and by among the miracles
going

France too urged by the noblest concern feels itself called upon
France magnanimously intimates to the Reichs Diet once and again
That Most Christian Majesty is guarantee of the Treaty of Westphalia
Most Christian Majesty cannot stand such procedures and then
the second time That Most Christian Majesty will interfere

in the dusky element those Eumenides giantlimbed serpenthaired
slowpacing circling torch in hand according to Schiller
scattering terror and madness At least in the Diplomatic Circles of
mankindif haply the Populations will follow suit


Friedrich abundantly contemptuous of Reichsthunder in the rusted
kind and well able to distinguish sound from substance in the Reich or
elsewhere recognizes in all this sufficiently portentous prophecies of
fact withal and understands none better what a perilous position he
has got into But he cannot mend itcan only as usual do his own
utmost in it As readers will believe he does and that his vigilance
and diligence are very great Continual ubiquitous and at the top of
his bent one fancies his effort must have beenthough he makes
no noise on the subject Considerable work he has with Hanover
this Winter with the poor English Government and their Army of
Observation which is to appear in the Hanover parts VERSUS those
100000 French next Spring To Hanover he has sent Schmettau the
Younger Schmettau Elder is now dead in regard to said Army has made
a new and closer Treaty with England impossible to be fulfilled on poor
Englands partand laments as Mitchell often does the tragically
embroiled condition of that Country struggling so vehemently to no
purpose to get out of bed and not unlike strangling or smothering
itself in its own blankets at present With and in regard to Saxony
his work is of course extremely considerable and in regard to his own
Army and its coming Business considerablest of all CounterManifesto
work to state his case in a distinct manner and leave it with
the Populations if the Diplomacies are deaf this too is copiously
proceeding under Artists who probably do not require much supervision
In fact no King living has such servants in the Civil or the Military
part to execute his will And no King so little wastes himself in
noises a King who has good command of himself first of all not to be
thrown off his balance by any terror any provocation even though his
temper is very sharp

Argusshe made him a Gift too the NIGHT of Correggio admired NOTTE
of Correggio having heard that he sat before it silent for half an
hour on entering that fine Gallerywhich is due to our Sovereign Lord
and his Bruhl alas On the other hand Friedrich had to take from her

the same and put Prussians in their stead Nay at one time on loud
outcry from her Majesty and great private cause of complaint against
her there was talk of sending the poor Royal lady to Warsaw after her
Husband but her objection being violent nothing came of that Winter
following her poor Majesty died 27th November 1757 and gave nobody
any farther trouble

Tetschen therefore will again need capture by the Prussians if they
again intend that way And in the mean while Friedrich to counterpoise
those mischievous Croat people has bethought him of organizing
a similar Force of his ownFoot chiefly for on hint of former
experience he already has Hussars in quantity And this Winter there
are accordingly in different Saxon Towns three Irregular Regiments
getting ready for him three Volunteer Colonels busily enlisting each

this SECRET LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS to Graf Finck von Finkenstein
his chief Home Minister one of his old boycomrades as readers may
recollect The Letter was read by Count Finck with profound attention
11th January 1757 and conned over till he knew every point of
it after which he sealed it up inscribing on the Cover
HOCHSTEIGENHANDIGE UND GANX GEHEIMEthat is HighestAutographic and
altogether Secret Instructions by the King which with the Appendixes
were delivered to me Graf von Finkenstein the 12th of January 1757
In this docketing it lay sealed for many years none knows how many
then unsealed still in strict keeping in the Private Royal Archives

select publicas readers shall see


SECRET INSTRUCTION FOR THE GRAF VON FINCK

BERLIN 10th January 1757

In the critical situation our affairs are in I ought to give you my
orders so that in all the disastrous cases which are in the possibility
of events you be authorized for taking the necessary steps

1 If it chanced which Heaven forbid that one of my Armies in Saxony
were totally beaten or that the French should drive the Hanoverians
from their Country which they failed not to do and establish
themselves there and threaten us with an invasion into the Altmark or
that the Russians should get through by the Neumarkyou are to save
the Royal Family the principal DICASTERIA LandSchedules Lists of
Taxdues the Ministries and the Directorium which is the central
Ministry of all If it is in Saxony on the Leipzig side that we are
beaten the fittest place for the removal of the Royal Family and of
the Treasure is to Custrin in such case the Royal Family and all above
named must go escorted by the whole Garrison of Berlin to Custrin
If the Russians entered by the Neumark or if a misfortune befell us
in the Lausitz it would be to Magdeburg that all would have to go in
fine the last refuge is Stettinbut you must not go till the
last extremity The Garrison the Royal Family and the Treasure are
inseparable and go always together to this must be added the Crown
Diamonds the Silver Plate in the Grand Apartmentswhich in such
case as well as the Gold Plate must be at once coined into money

If it happened that I were killed the Public Affairs must go on
without the smallest alteration or its being noticeable that they are
in other hands and in this case you must hasten forward the Oaths and
Homagings as well here as in Preussen and above all in Silesia If
I should have the fatality to be taken prisoner by the Enemy I prohibit
all of you from paying the least regard to my person or taking the
least heed of what I might write from my place of detention Should such
misfortune happen me I wish to sacrifice myself for the State and you
must obey my Brotherwho as well as all my Ministers and Generals
shall answer to me with their heads Not to offer any Province or any
Ransom for me but to continue the War pushing their advantages as if
I never had existed in the world

I hope and have ground to believe that you Count Finck will not
need to make use of this Instruction but in case of misfortune I
authorize you to employ it and as mark that it is after a mature and
sound deliberation my firm and constant will I sign it with my Hand
and confirm it with my Seal

Or in Friedrichs own spelling c so far as our possibilities
permit

FREDERIC R

Fac simile of Autograph Berlin 24th January 1854 where is some
indistinct History of the Document Printed also in _OEuvres_ xxv
319323

These privately made law in this manner are Friedrichs fixed feelings
and resolutionshow fixed is now farther apparent by a fact which was
then still more private guessable long afterwards only by one or two
and never clearly known so long as Friedrich lived the fact that he had
now most probably though the date is not known provided poison for
himself and constantly wore it about his person through this War Five
or six small pills in a small glass tube with a bit of ribbon to
it that stern relic lay in a worn condition in some drawer of
Friedrichs after Friedrich was gone Preuss ii 175 315 n For the
Facts are peremptory and a man that will deal with them must be equally
so

Two days after this Finck missive Friday 12th Friedrich took farewell
at Berlin drove to Potsdam that night with his Brother to Dresden next
day Adieu Madam Adieu O Mother said the King in royal terms but
with a heart altogether human May God above bless you my Son the
old Lady would replyand the Two had seen one another for the last
time Mother and Son were to meet no more in this world
