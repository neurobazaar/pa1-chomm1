November 1998 Etext 1522


Project Gutenberg Etext of Julius Caesar by Shakespeare
This file should be named 1522txt or 1522zip


This etext was prepared by the PG Shakespeare Team
a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers


Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

ACT I

SCENE I Rome A street

Enter Flavius Marullus and a Throng of Citizens

FLAVIUS
Hence home you idle creatures get you home
Is this a holiday What know you not
Being mechanical you ought not walk
Upon a laboring day without the sign
Of your professionSpeak what trade art thou

FIRST CITIZEN
Why sir a carpenter

MARULLUS
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule
What dost thou with thy best apparel on
You sir what trade are you

SECOND CITIZEN
Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but as you
would say a cobbler

MARULLUS
But what trade art thou Answer me directly

SECOND CITIZEN
A trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe
conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles

MARULLUS
What trade thou knave Thou naughty knave what trade

SECOND CITIZEN
Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet
if you be out sir I can mend you

MARULLUS
What meanst thou by that Mend me thou saucy fellow

SECOND CITIZEN
Why sir cobble you

FLAVIUS
Thou art a cobbler art thou

SECOND CITIZEN
Truly Sir all that I live by is with the awl I meddle with
no tradesmans matters nor womens matters but with awl
I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in
great danger I recover them As proper men as ever trod upon
neatsleather have gone upon my handiwork

FLAVIUS
But wherefore art not in thy shop today
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets

SECOND CITIZEN
Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more
work But indeed sir we make holiday to see Caesar and to
rejoice in his triumph

MARULLUS
Wherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home
What tributaries follow him to Rome
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome
Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft
Have you climbd up to walls and battlements
To towers and windows yea to chimney tops
Your infants in your arms and there have sat
The livelong day with patient expectation
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
And when you saw his chariot but appear
Have you not made an universal shout
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores
And do you now put on your best attire
And do you now cull out a holiday
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompeys blood
Be gone
Run to your houses fall upon your knees
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude

FLAVIUS
Go go good countrymen and for this fault
Assemble all the poor men of your sort
Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears
Into the channel till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all

Exeunt CITIZENS

See whether their basest metal be not moved
They vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness
Go you down that way towards the Capitol
This way will I Disrobe the images
If you do find them deckd with ceremonies

MARULLUS
May we do so
You know it is the feast of Lupercal

FLAVIUS
It is no matter let no images
Be hung with Caesars trophies Ill about
And drive away the vulgar from the streets
So do you too where you perceive them thick
These growing feathers pluckd from Caesars wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch
Who else would soar above the view of men
And keep us all in servile fearfulness

Exeunt



SCENE II The same A public place

Enter in procession with music Caesar Antony for the
course Calpurnia Portia Decius Cicero Brutus Cassius and
Casca a great crowd following among them a Soothsayer

CAESAR
Calpurnia

CASCA
Peace ho Caesar speaks

Music ceases

CAESAR
Calpurnia

CALPURNIA
Here my lord

CAESAR
Stand you directly in Antonius way
When he doth run his courseAntonius

ANTONY
Caesar my lord

CAESAR
Forget not in your speed Antonius
To touch Calpurnia for our elders say
The barren touched in this holy chase
Shake off their sterile curse

ANTONY
I shall remember
When Caesar says Do this it is performd

CAESAR
Set on and leave no ceremony out

Music

SOOTHSAYER
Caesar

CAESAR
Ha Who calls

CASCA
Bid every noise be stillPeace yet again

Music ceases

CAESAR
Who is it in the press that calls on me
I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
Cry Caesar Speak Caesar is turnd to hear

SOOTHSAYER
Beware the Ides of March

CAESAR
What man is that

BRUTUS
A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March

CAESAR
Set him before me let me see his face

CASSIUS
Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar

CAESAR
What sayst thou to me now Speak once again

SOOTHSAYER
Beware the Ides of March

CAESAR
He is a dreamer let us leave him Pass

Sennet Exeunt all but BRUTUS and CASSIUS

CASSIUS
Will you go see the order of the course

BRUTUS
Not I

CASSIUS
I pray you do

BRUTUS
I am not gamesome I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony
Let me not hinder Cassius your desires
Ill leave you

CASSIUS
Brutus I do observe you now of late
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you

BRUTUS
Cassius
Be not deceived if I have veild my look
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference
Conceptions only proper to myself
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved
Among which number Cassius be you one
Nor construe any further my neglect
Than that poor Brutus with himself at war
Forgets the shows of love to other men

CASSIUS
Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
Tell me good Brutus can you see your face

BRUTUS
No Cassius for the eye sees not itself
But by reflection by some other thing

CASSIUS
Tis just
And it is very much lamented Brutus
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye
That you might see your shadow I have heard
Where many of the best respect in Rome
Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus
And groaning underneath this ages yoke
Have wishd that noble Brutus had his eyes

BRUTUS
Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me

CASSIUS
Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection I your glass
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of
And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus
Were I a common laugher or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout then hold me dangerous

Flourish and shout

BRUTUS
What means this shouting I do fear the people
Choose Caesar for their king

CASSIUS
Ay do you fear it
Then must I think you would not have it so

BRUTUS
I would not Cassius yet I love him well
But wherefore do you hold me here so long
What is it that you would impart to me
If it be aught toward the general good
Set honor in one eye and death i the other
And I will look on both indifferently
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honor more than I fear death

CASSIUS
I know that virtue to be in you Brutus
As well as I do know your outward favor
Well honor is the subject of my story
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life but for my single self
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself
I was born free as Caesar so were you
We both have fed as well and we can both
Endure the winters cold as well as he
For once upon a raw and gusty day
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores
Caesar said to me Darest thou Cassius now
Leap in with me into this angry flood
And swim to yonder point Upon the word
Accoutred as I was I plunged in
And bade him follow so indeed he did
The torrent roard and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy
But ere we could arrive the point proposed
Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink
I as Aeneas our great ancestor
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar and this man
Is now become a god and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him
He had a fever when he was in Spain
And when the fit was on him I did mark
How he did shake tis true this god did shake
His coward lips did from their color fly
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his luster I did hear him groan
Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books
Alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius
As a sick girlYe gods it doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone

Shout Flourish

BRUTUS
Another general shout
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honors that are heapd on Caesar

CASSIUS
Why man he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonorable graves
Men at some time are masters of their fates
The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
But in ourselvesthat we are underlings
Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar
Why should that name be sounded more than yours
Write them together yours is as fair a name
Sound them it doth become the mouth as well
Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with them
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar
Now in the names of all the gods at once
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
That he is grown so great Age thou art shamed
Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
When went there by an age since the great flood
But it was famed with more than with one man
When could they say till now that talkd of Rome
That her wide walls encompassd but one man
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough
When there is in it but one only man
O you and I have heard our fathers say
There was a Brutus once that would have brookd
Th eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king

BRUTUS
That you do love me I am nothing jealous
What you would work me to I have some aim
How I have thought of this and of these times
I shall recount hereafter for this present
I would not so with love I might entreat you
Be any further moved What you have said
I will consider what you have to say
I will with patience hear and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things
Till then my noble friend chew upon this
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us

CASSIUS
I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus

BRUTUS
The games are done and Caesar is returning

CASSIUS
As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve
And he will after his sour fashion tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note today

Reenter Caesar and his Train

BRUTUS
I will do soBut look you Cassius
The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow
And all the rest look like a chidden train
Calpurnias cheek is pale and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol
Being crossd in conference by some senators

CASSIUS
Casca will tell us what the matter is

CAESAR
Antonius

ANTONY
Caesar

CAESAR
Let me have men about me that are fat
Sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look
He thinks too much such men are dangerous

ANTONY
Fear him not Caesar hes not dangerous
He is a noble Roman and well given

CAESAR
Would he were fatter But I fear him not
Yet if my name were liable to fear
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much
He is a great observer and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays
As thou dost Antony he hears no music
Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
As if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit
That could be moved to smile at any thing
Such men as he be never at hearts ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves
And therefore are they very dangerous
I rather tell thee what is to be feard
Than what I fear for always I am Caesar
Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
And tell me truly what thou thinkst of him

Exeunt Caesar and his Train Casca stays

CASCA
You pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me

BRUTUS
Ay Casca tell us what hath chanced today
That Caesar looks so sad

CASCA
Why you were with him were you not

BRUTUS
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced

CASCA
Why there was a crown offerd him and being offerd him
he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the
people fell ashouting

BRUTUS
What was the second noise for

CASCA
Why for that too

CASSIUS
They shouted thrice what was the last cry for

CASCA
Why for that too

BRUTUS
Was the crown offerd him thrice

CASCA
Ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler
than other and at every puttingby mine honest neighbors
shouted

CASSIUS
Who offerd him the crown

CASCA
Why Antony

BRUTUS
Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca

CASCA
I can as well be hangd as tell the manner of it it was
mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark Antony offer him a
crownyet twas not a crown neither twas one of these
coronetsand as I told you he put it by once but for all
that to my thinking he would fain have had it Then he
offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my
thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it And then
he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and
still as he refused it the rabblement shouted and clappd
their chopt hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and
uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused
the crown that it had almost choked Caesar for he swooned and
fell down at it and for mine own part I durst not laugh for
fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air

CASSIUS
But soft I pray you What did Caesar swoon

CASCA
He fell down in the marketplace and foamd at mouth and was
speechless

BRUTUS
Tis very like he hath the fallingsickness

CASSIUS
No Caesar hath it not but you and I
And honest Casca we have the fallingsickness

CASCA
I know not what you mean by that but I am sure Caesar fell
down If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do
the players in the theatre I am no true man

BRUTUS
What said he when he came unto himself

CASCA
Marry before he fell down when he perceived the common
herd was glad he refused the crown he pluckd me ope his
doublet and offered them his throat to cut an I had been a
man of any occupation if I would not have taken him at a word
I would I might go to hell among the roguesand so he fell
When he came to himself again he said if he had done or said
any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his
infirmity Three or four wenches where I stood cried Alas
good soul and forgave him with all their hearts But theres
no heed to be taken of them if Caesar had stabbd their
mothers they would have done no less

BRUTUS
And after that he came thus sad away

CASCA
Ay

CASSIUS
Did Cicero say any thing

CASCA
Ay he spoke Greek

CASSIUS
To what effect

CASCA
Nay an I tell you that Ill neer look you i the face
again but those that understood him smiled at one another and
shook their heads but for mine own part it was Greek to me I
could tell you more news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling
scarfs off Caesars images are put to silence Fare you well
There was more foolery yet if could remember it

CASSIUS
Will you sup with me tonight Casca

CASCA
No I am promised forth

CASSIUS
Will you dine with me tomorrow

CASCA
Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth
the eating

CASSIUS
Good I will expect you

CASCA
Do so farewell both

Exit CASCA

BRUTUS
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be
He was quick mettle when he went to school

CASSIUS
So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise
However he puts on this tardy form
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite

BRUTUS
And so it is For this time I will leave you
Tomorrow if you please to speak with me
I will come home to you or if you will
Come home to me and I will wait for you

CASSIUS
I will do so till then think of the world

Exit Brutus

Well Brutus thou art noble yet I see
Thy honorable metal may be wrought
From that it is disposed therefore tis meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes
For who so firm that cannot be seduced
Caesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
He should not humor me I will this night
In several hands in at his windows throw
As if they came from several citizens
Writings all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
Caesars ambition shall be glanced at
And after this let Caesar seat him sure
For we will shake him or worse days endure

Exit



SCENE III The same A street

Thunder and lightning Enter from opposite sides CASCA with
his sword drawn and CICERO

CICERO
Good even Casca brought you Caesar home
Why are you breathless and why stare you so

CASCA
Are not you moved when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen
Th ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
To be exalted with the threatening clouds
But never till tonight never till now
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire
Either there is a civil strife in heaven
Or else the world too saucy with the gods
Incenses them to send destruction

CICERO
Why saw you anything more wonderful

CASCA
A common slaveyoud know him well by sight
Held up his left hand which did flame and burn
Like twenty torches joind and yet his hand
Not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd
BesidesI ha not since put up my sword
Against the Capitol I met a lion
Who glared upon me and went surly by
Without annoying me and there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
Transformed with their fear who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noonday upon the marketplace
Howling and shrieking When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet let not men say
These are their reasons they are natural
For I believe they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon

CICERO
Indeed it is a strangedisposed time
But men may construe things after their fashion
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow

CASCA
He doth for he did bid Antonius
Send word to you he would be there tomorrow

CICERO
Good then Casca this disturbed sky
Is not to walk in

CASCA
Farewell Cicero

Exit Cicero

Enter Cassius

CASSIUS
Whos there

CASCA
A Roman

CASSIUS
Casca by your voice

CASCA
Your ear is good Cassius what night is this

CASSIUS
A very pleasing night to honest men

CASCA
Who ever knew the heavens menace so

CASSIUS
Those that have known the earth so full of faults
For my part I have walkd about the streets
Submitting me unto the perilous night
And thus unbraced Casca as you see
Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
And when the cross blue lightning seemd to open
The breast of heaven I did present myself
Even in the aim and very flash of it

CASCA
But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens
It is the part of men to fear and tremble
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us

CASSIUS
You are dull Cascaand those sparks of life
That should be in a Roman you do want
Or else you use not You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
To see the strange impatience of the Heavens
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
Why birds and beastsfrom quality and kind
Why old men fools and children calculate
Why all these things change from their ordinance
Their natures and preformed faculties
To monstrous qualitywhy you shall find
That Heaven hath infused them with these spirits
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state Now could I Casca
Name to thee a man most like this dreadful night
That thunders lightens opens graves and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol
A man no mightier than thyself or me
In personal action yet prodigious grown
And fearful as these strange eruptions are

CASCA
Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius

CASSIUS
Let it be who it is for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
But woe the while our fathers minds are dead
And we are governd with our mothers spirits
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish

CASCA
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Caesar as a king
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
In every place save here in Italy

CASSIUS
I know where I will wear this dagger then
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit
But life being weary of these worldly bars
Never lacks power to dismiss itself
If I know this know all the world besides
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure

Thunders still

CASCA
So can I
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity

CASSIUS
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then
Poor man I know he would not be a wolf
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
He were no lion were not Romans hinds
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws what trash is Rome
What rubbish and what offal when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief
Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman then I know
My answer must be made but I am armd
And dangers are to me indifferent

CASCA
You speak to Casca and to such a man
That is no fleering telltale Hold my hand
Be factious for redress of all these griefs
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest

CASSIUS
Theres a bargain made
Now know you Casca I have moved already
Some certain of the noblestminded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honorabledangerous consequence
And I do know by this they stay for me
In Pompeys Porch for now this fearful night
There is no stir or walking in the streets
And the complexion of the element
Is favord like the work we have in hand
Most bloody fiery and most terrible

CASCA
Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste

CASSIUS
Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait
He is a friend

Enter Cinna

Cinna where haste you so

CINNA
To find out you Whos that Metellus Cimber

CASSIUS
No it is Casca one incorporate
To our attempts Am I not stayd for Cinna

CINNA
I am glad ont What a fearful night is this
Theres two or three of us have seen strange sights

CASSIUS
Am I not stayd for tell me

CINNA
Yes
You are O Cassius if you could but win
The noble Brutus to our party

CASSIUS
Be you content Good Cinna take this paper
And look you lay it in the praetors chair
Where Brutus may but find it and throw this
In at his window set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus statue all this done
Repair to Pompeys Porch where you shall find us
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there

CINNA
All but Metellus Cimber and hes gone
To seek you at your house Well I will hie
And so bestow these papers as you bade me

CASSIUS
That done repair to Pompeys theatre

Exit Cinna

Come Casca you and I will yet ere day
See Brutus at his house three parts of him
Is ours already and the man entire
Upon the next encounter yields him ours

CASCA
O he sits high in all the peoples hearts
And that which would appear offense in us
His countenance like richest alchemy
Will change to virtue and to worthiness

CASSIUS
Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited Let us go
For it is after midnight and ere day
We will awake him and be sure of him

Exeunt



ACT II

SCENE I Rome BRUTUSS orchard

Enter Brutus

BRUTUS
What Lucius ho
I cannot by the progress of the stars
Give guess how near to dayLucius I say
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
When Lucius when Awake I say What Lucius

Enter Lucius

LUCIUS
Calld you my lord

BRUTUS
Get me a taper in my study Lucius
When it is lighted come and call me here

LUCIUS
I will my lord

Exit

BRUTUS
It must be by his death and for my part
I know no personal cause to spurn at him
But for the general He would be crownd
How that might change his nature theres the question
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
And that craves wary walking Crown himthat
And then I grant we put a sting in him
That at his will he may do danger with
Th abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar
I have not known when his affections swayd
More than his reason But tis a common proof
That lowliness is young ambitions ladder
Whereto the climberupward turns his face
But when he once attains the upmost round
He then unto the ladder turns his back
Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend so Caesar may
Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel
Will bear no color for the thing he is
Fashion it thusthat what he is augmented
Would run to these and these extremities
And therefore think him as a serpents egg
Which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous
And kill him in the shell

Reenter Lucius

LUCIUS
The taper burneth in your closet sir
Searching the window for a flint I found
This paper thus seald up and I am sure
It did not lie there when I went to bed

BRUTUS
Get you to bed again it is not day
Is not tomorrow boy the Ides of March

LUCIUS
I know not sir

BRUTUS
Look in the calendar and bring me word

LUCIUS
I will sir

Exit

BRUTUS
The exhalations whizzing in the air
Give so much light that I may read by them

Opens the letter and reads
Brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself
Shall Rome c Speak strike redress
Brutus thou sleepst awake

Such instigations have been often droppd
Where I have took them up
Shall Rome  c Thus must I piece it out
Shall Rome stand under one mans awe What Rome
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
The Tarquin drive when he was calld a king
Speak strike redressAm I entreated then
To speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise
If the redress will follow thou receivest
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus

Reenter Lucius

LUCIUS
Sir March is wasted fifteen days

Knocking within

BRUTUS
Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocks

Exit Lucius

Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
I have not slept
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
And the first motion all the interim is
Like a phantasma or a hideous dream
The genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council and the state of man
Like to a little kingdom suffers then
The nature of an insurrection

Reenter Lucius

LUCIUS
Sir tis your brother Cassius at the door
Who doth desire to see you

BRUTUS
Is he alone

LUCIUS
No sir there are more with him

BRUTUS
Do you know them

LUCIUS
No sir their hats are pluckd about their ears
And half their faces buried in their cloaks
That by no means I may discover them
By any mark of favor

BRUTUS
Let em enter

Exit Lucius
They are the factionO conspiracy
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
When evils are most free O then by day
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none conspiracy
Hide it in smiles and affability
For if thou pass thy native semblance on
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
To hide thee from prevention

Enter Cassius Casca Decius Cinna Metellus Cimber and
Trebonius

CASSIUS
I think we are too bold upon your rest
Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you

BRUTUS
I have been up this hour awake all night
Know I these men that come along with you

CASSIUS
Yes every man of them and no man here
But honors you and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you
This is Trebonius

BRUTUS
He is welcome hither

CASSIUS
This Decius Brutus

BRUTUS
He is welcome too

CASSIUS
This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber

BRUTUS
They are all welcome
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
Betwixt your eyes and night

CASSIUS
Shall I entreat a word

BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper apart

DECIUS
Here lies the east doth not the day break here

CASCA
No

CINNA
O pardon sir it doth and yon grey lines
That fret the clouds are messengers of day

CASCA
You shall confess that you are both deceived
Here as I point my sword the Sun arises
Which is a great way growing on the South
Weighing the youthful season of the year
Some two months hence up higher toward the North
He first presents his fire and the high East
Stands as the Capitol directly here

BRUTUS
Give me your hands all over one by one

CASSIUS
And let us swear our resolution

BRUTUS
No not an oath if not the face of men
The sufferance of our souls the times abuse
If these be motives weak break off betimes
And every man hence to his idle bed
So let highsighted tyranny range on
Till each man drop by lottery But if these
As I am sure they do bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
The melting spirits of women then countrymen
What need we any spur but our own cause
To prick us to redress what other bond
Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
And will not palter and what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged
That this shall be or we will fall for it
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise
Nor th insuppressive mettle of our spirits
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears and nobly bears
Is guilty of a several bastardy
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath passd from him

CASSIUS
But what of Cicero Shall we sound him
I think he will stand very strong with us

CASCA
Let us not leave him out

CINNA
No by no means

METELLUS
O let us have him for his silver hairs
Will purchase us a good opinion
And buy mens voices to commend our deeds
It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
But all be buried in his gravity

BRUTUS
O name him not let us not break with him
For he will never follow any thing
That other men begin

CASSIUS
Then leave him out

CASCA
Indeed he is not fit

DECIUS
Shall no man else be touchd but only Caesar

CASSIUS
Decius well urgedI think it is not meet
Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar
Should outlive Caesar we shall find of him
A shrewd contriver and you know his means
If he improve them may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all which to prevent
Let Antony and Caesar fall together

BRUTUS
Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar
And in the spirit of men there is no blood
O that we then could come by Caesars spirit
And not dismember Caesar But alas
Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends
Lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully
Lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
And let our hearts as subtle masters do
Stir up their servants to an act of rage
And after seem to chide em This shall mark
Our purpose necessary and not envious
Which so appearing to the common eyes
We shall be calld purgers not murderers
And for Mark Antony think not of him
For he can do no more than Caesars arm
When Caesars head is off

CASSIUS
Yet I do fear him
For in th ingrafted love he bears to Caesar

BRUTUS
Alas good Cassius do not think of him
If he love Caesar all that he can do
Is to himselftake thought and die for Caesar
And that were much he should for he is given
To sports to wildness and much company

TREBONIUS
There is no fear in him let him not die
For he will live and laugh at this hereafter

Clock strikes

BRUTUS
Peace count the clock

CASSIUS
The clock hath stricken three

TREBONIUS
Tis time to part

CASSIUS
But it is doubtful yet
Whether Caesar will come forth today or no
For he is superstitious grown of late
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
It may be these apparent prodigies
The unaccustomd terror of this night
And the persuasion of his augurers
May hold him from the Capitol today

DECIUS
Never fear that if he be so resolved
I can oersway him for he loves to hear
That unicorns may be betrayd with trees
And bears with glasses elephants with holes
Lions with toils and men with flatterers
But when I tell him he hates flatterers
He says he does being then most flattered
Let me work
For I can give his humor the true bent
And I will bring him to the Capitol

CASSIUS
Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him

BRUTUS
By the eighth hour is that the uttermost

CINNA
Be that the uttermost and fail not then

METELLUS
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
I wonder none of you have thought of him

BRUTUS
Now good Metellus go along by him
He loves me well and I have given him reason
Send him but hither and Ill fashion him

CASSIUS
The morning comes upon s Well leave you Brutus
And friends disperse yourselves but all remember
What you have said and show yourselves true Romans

BRUTUS
Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
Let not our looks put on our purposes
But bear it as our Roman actors do
With untired spirits and formal constancy
And so good morrow to you every one

Exeunt all but Brutus

Boy LuciusFast asleep It is no matter
Enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
Which busy care draws in the brains of men
Therefore thou sleepst so sound

Enter Portia

PORTIA
Brutus my lord

BRUTUS
Portia what mean you wherefore rise you now
It is not for your health thus to commit
Your weak condition to the rawcold morning

PORTIA
Nor for yours neither Youve ungently Brutus
Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
You suddenly arose and walkd about
Musing and sighing with your arms across
And when I askd you what the matter was
You stared upon me with ungentle looks
I urged you further then you scratchd your head
And too impatiently stampd with your foot
Yet I insisted yet you answerd not
But with an angry wafture of your hand
Gave sign for me to leave you So I did
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seemd too much enkindled and withal
Hoping it was but an effect of humour
Which sometime hath his hour with every man
It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
And could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevaild on your condition
I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief

BRUTUS
I am not well in health and that is all

PORTIA
Brutus is wise and were he not in health
He would embrace the means to come by it

BRUTUS
Why so I do Good Portia go to bed

PORTIA
Is Brutus sick and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
To dare the vile contagion of the night
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness No my Brutus
You have some sick offense within your mind
Which by the right and virtue of my place
I ought to know of and upon my knees
I charge you by my once commended beauty
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one
That you unfold to me yourself your half
Why you are heavy and what men tonight
Have had resort to you for here have been
Some six or seven who did hide their faces
Even from darkness

BRUTUS
Kneel not gentle Portia

PORTIA
I should not need if you were gentle Brutus
Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
That appertain to you Am I yourself
But as it were in sort or limitation
To keep with you at meals comfort your bed
And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs
Of your good pleasure If it be no more
Portia is Brutus harlot not his wife

BRUTUS
You are my true and honorable wife
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart

PORTIA
If this were true then should I know this secret
I grant I am a woman but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
I grant I am a woman but withal
A woman well reputed Catos daughter
Think you I am no stronger than my sex
Being so fatherd and so husbanded
Tell me your counsels I will not disclose em
I have made strong proof of my constancy
Giving myself a voluntary wound
Here in the thigh can I bear that with patience
And not my husbands secrets

BRUTUS
O ye gods
Render me worthy of this noble wife

Knocking within

Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
The secrets of my heart
All my engagements I will construe to thee
All the charactery of my sad brows
Leave me with haste

Exit Portia

Lucius whos that knocks

Reenter Lucius with Ligarius

LUCIUS
Here is a sick man that would speak with you

BRUTUS
Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of
Boy stand asideCaius Ligariushow

LIGARIUS
Vouchsafe goodmorrow from a feeble tongue

BRUTUS
O what a time have you chose out brave Caius
To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick

LIGARIUS
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand
Any exploit worthy the name of honour

BRUTUS
Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it

LIGARIUS
By all the gods that Romans bow before
I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome
Brave son derived from honorable loins
Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
My mortified spirit Now bid me run
And I will strive with things impossible
Yea get the better of them Whats to do

BRUTUS
A piece of work that will make sick men whole

LIGARIUS
But are not some whole that we must make sick

BRUTUS
That must we also What it is my Caius
I shall unfold to thee as we are going
To whom it must be done

LIGARIUS
Set on your foot
And with a heart newfired I follow you
To do I know not what but it sufficeth
That Brutus leads me on

BRUTUS
Follow me then

Exeunt



SCENE II A room in Caesars palace

Thunder and lightning Enter Caesar in his nightgown

CAESAR
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out
Help ho They murder CaesarWhos within

Enter a Servant

SERVANT
My lord

CAESAR
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
And bring me their opinions of success

SERVANT
I will my lord

Exit

Enter Calpurnia

CALPURNIA
What mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth
You shall not stir out of your house today

CAESAR
Caesar shall forth the things that threaten me
Neer look but on my back when they shall see
The face of Caesar they are vanished

CALPURNIA
Caesar I never stood on ceremonies
Yet now they fright me There is one within
Besides the things that we have heard and seen
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
A lioness hath whelped in the streets
And graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol
The noise of battle hurtled in the air
Horses did neigh and dying men did groan
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
O Caesarthese things are beyond all use
And I do fear them

CAESAR
What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Caesar

CALPURNIA
When beggars die there are no comets seen
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes

CAESAR
Cowards die many times before their deaths
The valiant never taste of death but once
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard
It seems to me most strange that men should fear
Seeing that death a necessary end
Will come when it will come

Reenter Servant

What say the augurers

SERVANT
They would not have you to stir forth today
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth
They could not find a heart within the beast

CAESAR
The gods do this in shame of cowardice
Caesar should be a beast without a heart
If he should stay at home today for fear
No Caesar shall not danger knows full well
That Caesar is more dangerous than he
We are two lions litterd in one day
And I the elder and more terrible
And Caesar shall go forth

CALPURNIA
Alas my lord
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence
Do not go forth today call it my fear
That keeps you in the house and not your own
Well send Mark Antony to the Senatehouse
And he shall say you are not well today
Let me upon my knee prevail in this

CAESAR
Mark Antony shall say I am not well
And for thy humor I will stay at home

Enter Decius

Heres Decius Brutus he shall tell them so

DECIUS
Caesar all hail Good morrow worthy Caesar
I come to fetch you to the Senatehouse

CAESAR
And you are come in very happy time
To bear my greeting to the Senators
And tell them that I will not come today
Cannot is false and that I dare not falser
I will not come today Tell them so Decius

CALPURNIA
Say he is sick

CAESAR
Shall Caesar send a lie
Have I in conquest stretchd mine arm so far
To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth
Decius go tell them Caesar will not come

DECIUS
Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause
Lest I be laughd at when I tell them so

CAESAR
The cause is in my will I will not come
That is enough to satisfy the Senate
But for your private satisfaction
Because I love you I will let you know
Calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
She dreamt tonight she saw my statua
Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans
Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
And these does she apply for warnings and portents
And evils imminent and on her knee
Hath beggd that I will stay at home today

DECIUS
This dream is all amiss interpreted
It was a vision fair and fortunate
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes
In which so many smiling Romans bathed
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Reviving blood and that great men shall press
For tinctures stains relics and cognizance
This by Calpurnias dream is signified

CAESAR
And this way have you well expounded it

DECIUS
I have when you have heard what I can say
And know it now The Senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar
If you shall send them word you will not come
Their minds may change Besides it were a mock
Apt to be renderd for someone to say
Break up the Senate till another time
When Caesars wife shall meet with better dreams
If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
Lo Caesar is afraid
Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love
To your proceeding bids me tell you this
And reason to my love is liable

CAESAR
How foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia
I am ashamed I did yield to them
Give me my robe for I will go

Enter Publius Brutus Ligarius Metellus Casca
Trebonius and Cinna

And look where Publius is come to fetch me

PUBLIUS
Good morrow Caesar

CAESAR
Welcome Publius
What Brutus are you stirrd so early too

As that same ague which hath made you lean
What ist oclock

BRUTUS

CAESAR
I thank you for your pains and courtesy

Enter Antony

See Antony that revels long onights
Is notwithstanding upGood morrow Antony

ANTONY
So to most noble Caesar

CAESAR
Bid them prepare within
I am to blame to be thus waited for
Now Cinnanow Metelluswhat Trebonius
I have an hours talk in store for you
Remember that you call on me today
Be near me that I may remember you

TREBONIUS
Caesar I will Aside and so near will I be
That your best friends shall wish I had been further

CAESAR
Good friends go in and taste some wine with me
And we like friends will straightway go together

BRUTUS
Aside That every like is not the same O Caesar
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon

Exeunt



SCENE III A street near the Capitol

Enter Artemidorus reading paper

ARTEMIDORUS
Caesar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius come
not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not Trebonius mark
well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus loves thee not thou hast
wrongd Caius Ligarius There is but one mind in all these men
and it is bent against Caesar If thou best not immortal look
about you security gives way to conspiracy The mighty gods
defend thee
Thy lover Artemidorus
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along
And as a suitor will I give him this
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation
If thou read this O Caesar thou mayest live
If not the Fates with traitors do contrive

Exit



SCENE IV Another part of the same street before the house of
Brutus

Enter Portia and Lucius

PORTIA
I prythee boy run to the Senatehouse
Stay not to answer me but get thee gone
Why dost thou stay

LUCIUS
To know my errand madam

PORTIA
I would have had thee there and here again
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there
Aside O constancy be strong upon my side
Set a huge mountain tween my heart and tongue
I have a mans mind but a womans might
How hard it is for women to keep counsel
Art thou here yet

LUCIUS
Madam what should I do
Run to the Capitol and nothing else
And so return to you and nothing else

PORTIA
Yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well
For he went sickly forth and take good note
What Caesar doth what suitors press to him
Hark boy what noise is that

LUCIUS
I hear none madam

PORTIA
Prythee listen well
I heard a bustling rumour like a fray
And the wind brings it from the Capitol

LUCIUS
Sooth madam I hear nothing

Enter Artemidorus

PORTIA
Come hither fellow
Which way hast thou been

ARTEMIDORUS
At mine own house good lady

PORTIA

ARTEMIDORUS
Madam not yet I go to take my stand
To see him pass on to the Capitol

PORTIA
Thou hast some suit to Caesar hast thou not

ARTEMIDORUS
That I have lady if it will please Caesar
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me
I shall beseech him to befriend himself

PORTIA
Why knowst thou any harms intended towards him

ARTEMIDORUS
None that I know will be much that I fear may chance
Good morrow to youHere the street is narrow
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels
Of Senators of Praetors common suitors
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death
Ill get me to a place more void and there
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along

Exit

PORTIA
I must go inAside Ah me how weak a thing
The heart of woman isO Brutus
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise
Sure the boy heard meBrutus hath a suit
That Caesar will not grantO I grow faint
Run Lucius and commend me to my lord
Say I am merry come to me again
And bring me word what he doth say to thee

Exeunt

DECIUS
Where is Metellus Cimber Let him go
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar

BRUTUS
He is addressd press near and second him

CINNA
Casca you are the first that rears your hand

CASCA
Are we all ready

CAESAR
What is now amiss
That Caesar and his Senate must redress

METELLUS
Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
An humble heart

Kneeling

CAESAR
I must prevent thee Cimber
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men
And turn preordinance and first decree
Into the law of children Be not fond
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
That will be thawd from the true quality
With that which melteth fools I mean sweet words
Lowcrooked curtsies and base spanielfawning
Thy brother by decree is banished
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way

METELLUS
Caesar thou dost me wrong

CAESAR
Caesar did never wrong but with just cause
Nor without cause will he be satisfied

METELLUS
Is there no voice more worthy than my own
To sound more sweetly in great Caesars ear
For the repealing of my banishd brother

BRUTUS
I kiss thy hand but not in flattery Caesar
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal

CAESAR
What Brutus

CASSIUS
Pardon Caesar Caesar pardon
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber

CAESAR
I could be well moved if I were as you
If I could pray to move prayers would move me
But I am constant as the northern star
Of whose truefixd and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament
The skies are painted with unnumberd sparks
They are all fire and every one doth shine
But theres but one in all doth hold his place
So in the world tis furnishd well with men
And men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank
Unshaked of motion and that I am he
Let me a little show it even in this
That I was constant Cimber should be banishd
And constant do remain to keep him so

CINNA
O Caesar

CAESAR
Hence wilt thou lift up Olympus

DECIUS
Great Caesar

CAESAR
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel

CASCA
Speak hands for me

Casca stabs Caesar in the neck Caesar catches hold of his arm
He is then stabbed by several other Conspirators and at last by
Marcus Brutus

CAESAR
Et tu Brute Then fall Caesar

Dies The Senators and People retire in confusion

CINNA
Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead
Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets

CASSIUS
Some to the common pulpits and cry out
Liberty freedom and enfranchisement

BRUTUS
People and Senators be not affrighted
Fly not stand still ambitions debt is paid

CASCA
Go to the pulpit Brutus

DECIUS
And Cassius too

BRUTUS
Wheres Publius

CINNA
Here quite confounded with this mutiny

METELLUS
Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesars
Should chance

BRUTUS
Talk not of standingPublius good cheer
There is no harm intended to your person
Nor to no Roman else so tell them Publius

CASSIUS
And leave us Publius lest that the people
Rushing on us should do your age some mischief

BRUTUS
Do soand let no man abide this deed
But we the doers

Reenter Trebonius

CASSIUS
Wheres Antony

TREBONIUS
Fled to his house amazed
Men wives and children stare cry out and run
As it were doomsday

BRUTUS
Fates we will know your pleasures
That we shall die we know tis but the time
And drawing days out that men stand upon

CASCA
Why he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death

BRUTUS
Grant that and then is death a benefit
So are we Caesars friends that have abridged
His time of fearing deathStoop Romans stoop
And let us bathe our hands in Caesars blood
Up to the elbows and besmear our swords
Then walk we forth even to the marketplace
And waving our red weapons oer our heads
Lets all cry Peace freedom and liberty

CASSIUS
Stoop then and wash How many ages hence
Shall this our lofty scene be acted oer
In States unborn and accents yet unknown

BRUTUS
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport
That now on Pompeys basis lies along
No worthier than the dust

CASSIUS
So oft as that shall be
So often shall the knot of us be calld
The men that gave their country liberty

DECIUS
What shall we forth

CASSIUS
Ay every man away
Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome

BRUTUS
Soft who comes here

Enter a Servant

A friend of Antonys

SERVANT
Thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down
And being prostrate thus he bade me say
Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
Say I love Brutus and I honor him
Say I feard Caesar honourd him and loved him
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
May safely come to him and be resolved
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
So well as Brutus living but will follow
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
With all true faith So says my master Antony

BRUTUS
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman
I never thought him worse
Tell him so please him come unto this place
He shall be satisfied and by my honour
Depart untouchd

SERVANT
Ill fetch him presently

Exit

BRUTUS
I know that we shall have him well to friend

CASSIUS
I wish we may but yet have I a mind
That fears him much and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose

BRUTUS
But here comes Antony

Reenter Antony

Welcome Mark Antony

ANTONY
O mighty Caesar Dost thou lie so low
Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well
I know not gentlemen what you intend
Who else must be let blood who else is rank
If I myself there is no hour so fit
As Caesars deathhour nor no instrument
Of half that worth as those your swords made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world
I do beseech ye if you bear me hard
Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
Fulfill your pleasure Live a thousand years
I shall not find myself so apt to die
No place will please me so no means of death
As here by Caesar and by you cut off
The choice and master spirits of this age

BRUTUS
O Antony beg not your death of us
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel
As by our hands and this our present act
You see we do yet see you but our hands
And this the bleeding business they have done
Our hearts you see not they are pitiful
And pity to the general wrong of Rome
As fire drives out fire so pity pity
Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part
To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony
Our arms in strength of amity and our hearts
Of brothers temper do receive you in
With all kind love good thoughts and reverence

CASSIUS
Your voice shall be as strong as any mans
In the disposing of new dignities

BRUTUS
Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude beside themselves with fear
And then we will deliver you the cause
Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him
Have thus proceeded

ANTONY
I doubt not of your wisdom
Let each man render me his bloody hand
First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you
Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand
Now Decius Brutus yoursnow yours Metellus
Yours Cinnaand my valiant Casca yours
Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius
Gentlemen allalas what shall I say
My credit now stands on such slippery ground
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me
Either a coward or a flatterer
That I did love thee Caesar O tis true
If then thy spirit look upon us now
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
To see thy Antony making his peace
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
Most noblein the presence of thy corse
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
It would become me better than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies
Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bayd brave hart
Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
Signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy death
O world thou wast the forest to this hart
And this indeed O world the heart of thee
How like a deer strucken by many princes
Dost thou here lie

CASSIUS
Mark Antony

ANTONY
Pardon me Caius Cassius
The enemies of Caesar shall say this
Then in a friend it is cold modesty

CASSIUS
I blame you not for praising Caesar so
But what compact mean you to have with us
Will you be prickd in number of our friends
Or shall we on and not depend on you

ANTONY
Therefore I took your hands but was indeed
Swayd from the point by looking down on Caesar
Friends am I with you all and love you all
Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous

BRUTUS
Or else were this a savage spectacle
Our reasons are so full of good regard
That were you Antony the son of Caesar
You should be satisfied

ANTONY
Thats all I seek
And am moreover suitor that I may
Produce his body to the marketplace
And in the pulpit as becomes a friend
Speak in the order of his funeral

BRUTUS
You shall Mark Antony

CASSIUS
Brutus a word with you
Aside to Brutus You know not what you do do not consent
That Antony speak in his funeral
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter

BRUTUS
Aside to Cassius By your pardon
I will myself into the pulpit first
And show the reason of our Caesars death
What Antony shall speak I will protest
He speaks by leave and by permission
And that we are contented Caesar shall
Have all true rights and lawful ceremonies
It shall advantage more than do us wrong

CASSIUS
Aside to Brutus I know not what may fall I like it not

BRUTUS
Mark Antony here take you Caesars body
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar
And say you dot by our permission
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral and you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going
After my speech is ended

ANTONY
Be it so
I do desire no more

BRUTUS
Prepare the body then and follow us

Exeunt all but Antony

ANTONY
O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarterd with the hands of war
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
And Caesars spirit ranging for revenge
With Ate by his side come hot from Hell
Shall in these confines with a monarchs voice
Cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men groaning for burial

Enter a Servant

You serve Octavius Caesar do you not

SERVANT
I do Mark Antony

ANTONY
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome

SERVANT
He did receive his letters and is coming
And bid me say to you by word of mouth
Seeing the body O Caesar

ANTONY
Thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
Passion I see is catching for mine eyes
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
Began to water Is thy master coming

SERVANT
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome

ANTONY
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet
Hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the marketplace there shall I try
In my oration how the people take
The cruel issue of these bloody men
According to the which thou shalt discourse
To young Octavius of the state of things
Lend me your hand

Exeunt with Caesars body



SCENE II The same The Forum

Enter Brutus and Cassius with a throng of Citizens

CITIZENS
We will be satisfied let us be satisfied

BRUTUS

Be patient till the last
Romans countrymen and lovers Hear me for my cause and be
silent that you may hear believe me for mine honour and have
respect to mine honor that you may believe censure me in your
wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge
If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesars to
him I say that Brutus love to Caesar was no less than his If
then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is
my answerNot that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome
more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than
that Caesar were dead to live all freemen As Caesar loved me I
weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was
valiant I honour him but as he was ambitious I slew him
There is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his
valour and death for his ambition Who is here so base that
would be a bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who
is here so rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him
have I offended Who is here so vile that will not love his
country If any speak for him have I offended I pause for a
reply

CITIZENS
None Brutus none

BRUTUS
Then none have I offended I have done no more to Caesar
than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is
enrolld in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he
was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered
death

Enter Antony and others with Caesars body

Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had
no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a
place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With this

THIRD CITIZEN

We are blest that Rome is rid of him

SECOND CITIZEN
Peace let us hear what Antony can say

ANTONY
You gentle Romans

CITIZENS
Peace ho let us hear him

ANTONY
Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
I come to bury Caesar not to praise him
The evil that men do lives after them
The good is oft interred with their bones
So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious
If it were so it was a grievous fault
And grievously hath Caesar answerd it
Here under leave of Brutus and the rest
For Brutus is an honourable man
So are they all all honorable men
Come I to speak in Caesars funeral
He was my friend faithful and just to me
But Brutus says he was ambitious
And Brutus is an honourable man
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious
When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
And Brutus is an honourable man
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown
Which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
And sure he is an honourable man
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
But here I am to speak what I do know
You all did love him oncenot without cause
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him
O judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
And men have lost their reasonBear with me
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar
And I must pause till it come back to me

FIRST CITIZEN
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings

SECOND CITIZEN
If thou consider rightly of the matter
Caesar has had great wrong

THIRD CITIZEN
Has he not masters
I fear there will a worse come in his place

FOURTH CITIZEN
Markd ye his words He would not take the crown
Therefore tis certain he was not ambitious

FIRST CITIZEN
If it be found so some will dear abide it

SECOND CITIZEN
Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping

THIRD CITIZEN
Theres not a nobler man in Rome than Antony

FOURTH CITIZEN
Now mark him he begins again to speak

ANTONY
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world now lies he there
And none so poor to do him reverence
O masters if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong
Who you all know are honourable men
I will not do them wrong I rather choose
To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
Than I will wrong such honourable men
But heres a parchment with the seal of Caesar
I found it in his closettis his will
Let but the commons hear this testament
Which pardon me I do not mean to read
And they would go and kiss dead Caesars wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood
Yea beg a hair of him for memory
And dying mention it within their wills
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue

FOURTH CITIZEN
Well hear the will read it Mark Antony

CITIZENS
The will the will We will hear Caesars will

ANTONY
Have patience gentle friends I must not read it
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you
You are not wood you are not stones but men
And being men hearing the will of Caesar
It will inflame you it will make you mad
Tis good you know not that you are his heirs
For if you should O what would come of it

FOURTH CITIZEN
Read the will well hear it Antony
You shall read us the willCaesars will

ANTONY
Will you be patient will you stay awhile
I have oershot myself to tell you of it
I fear I wrong the honorable men
Whose daggers have stabbd Caesar I do fear it

FOURTH CITIZEN
They were traitors honourable men

CITIZENS
The will The testament

SECOND CITIZEN
They were villains murderers The will read the will

ANTONY
You will compel me then to read the will
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar
And let me show you him that made the will
Shall I descend and will you give me leave

CITIZENS
Come down

SECOND CITIZEN

THIRD CITIZEN

SECOND CITIZEN
Room for Antonymost noble Antony

ANTONY
Nay press not so upon me stand far off

CITIZENS
Stand back room bear back

ANTONY
If you have tears prepare to shed them now
You all do know this mantle I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on
Twas on a Summers evening in his tent
That day he overcame the Nervii
Look in this place ran Cassius dagger through
See what a rent the envious Casca made
Through this the wellbeloved Brutus stabbd
And as he pluckd his cursed steel away
Mark how the blood of Caesar followd it
As rushing out of doors to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knockd or no
For Brutus as you know was Caesars angel
Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
This was the most unkindest cut of all
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab
Ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
Quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart
And in his mantle muffling up his face
Even at the base of Pompeys statua
Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell
O what a fall was there my countrymen
Then I and you and all of us fell down
Whilst bloody treason flourishd over us
O now you weep and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity these are gracious drops
Kind souls what weep you when you but behold
Our Caesars vesture wounded Look you here
Here is himself marrd as you see with traitors

FIRST CITIZEN
O piteous spectacle

SECOND CITIZEN
O noble Caesar

THIRD CITIZEN
O woeful day

ANTONY
Stay countrymen

FIRST CITIZEN
Peace there hear the noble Antony

SECOND CITIZEN
Well hear him well follow him well die with him

ANTONY
Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny
They that have done this deed are honourable
What private griefs they have alas I know not
That made them do it theyre wise and honourable
And will no doubt with reasons answer you
I come not friends to steal away your hearts
I am no orator as Brutus is
But as you know me all a plain blunt man
That love my friend and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him
For I have neither wit nor words nor worth
Action nor utterance nor the power of speech
To stir mens blood I only speak right on
I tell you that which you yourselves do know
Show you sweet Caesars wounds poor dumb mouths
And bid them speak for me but were I Brutus
And Brutus Antony there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny

CITIZENS
Well mutiny

FIRST CITIZEN
Well burn the house of Brutus

THIRD CITIZEN
Away then come seek the conspirators

ANTONY
Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak

ANTONY

CITIZENS
Peace ho

His private arbors and newplanted orchards
On this side Tiber he hath left them you
And to your heirs forever common pleasures
To walk abroad and recreate yourselves

ACT IV

SCENE I Rome A room in Antonys house

Antony Octavius and Lepidus seated at a table

ANTONY
These many then shall die their names are prickd

OCTAVIUS
Your brother too must die consent you Lepidus

LEPIDUS
I do consent

OCTAVIUS
Prick him down Antony

LEPIDUS
Upon condition Publius shall not live
Who is your sisters son Mark Antony

ANTONY
He shall not live look with a spot I damn him
But Lepidus go you to Caesars house
Fetch the will hither and we shall determine
How to cut off some charge in legacies

LEPIDUS
What shall I find you here

OCTAVIUS
Or here or at the Capitol

Exit Lepidus

ANTONY
This is a slight unmeritable man
Meet to be sent on errands is it fit
The threefold world divided he should stand
One of the three to share it

OCTAVIUS
So you thought him
And took his voice who should be prickd to die
In our black sentence and proscription

ANTONY
Octavius I have seen more days than you
And though we lay these honors on this man
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
To groan and sweat under the business
Either led or driven as we point the way
And having brought our treasure where we will
Then take we down his load and turn him off
Like to the empty ass to shake his ears
And graze in commons

OCTAVIUS
You may do your will
But hes a tried and valiant soldier

ANTONY
So is my horse Octaviusand for that
I do appoint him store of provender
It is a creature that I teach to fight
To wind to stop to run directly on
His corporal motion governd by my spirit
And in some taste is Lepidus but so
He must be taught and traind and bid go forth
A barrenspirited fellow one that feeds
On objects arts and imitations
Which out of use and staled by other men
Begin his fashion do not talk of him
But as a property And now Octavius
Listen great things Brutus and Cassius
Are levying powers we must straight make head
Therefore let our alliance be combined
Our best friends made our means stretchd
And let us presently go sit in council
How covert matters may be best disclosed
And open perils surest answered

OCTAVIUS
Let us do so for we are at the stake
And bayd about with many enemies
And some that smile have in their hearts I fear
Millions of mischiefs

Exeunt



SCENE II Before Brutus tent in the camp near Sardis

Drum Enter Brutus Lucilius Titinius and Soldiers Pindarus
meeting them Lucius at some distance

BRUTUS
Stand ho

LUCILIUS
Give the word ho and stand

BRUTUS
What now Lucilius is Cassius near

LUCILIUS
He is at hand and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master

Pindarus gives a letter to Brutus

BRUTUS
He greets me wellYour master Pindarus
In his own change or by ill officers
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done undone but if he be at hand
I shall be satisfied

PINDARUS
I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is full of regard and honour

BRUTUS
He is not doubtedA word Lucilius
How he received you let me be resolved

LUCILIUS
With courtesy and with respect enough
But not with such familiar instances
Nor with such free and friendly conference
As he hath used of old

BRUTUS
Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling ever note Lucilius
When love begins to sicken and decay
It useth an enforced ceremony
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith
But hollow men like horses hot at hand
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle
But when they should endure the bloody spur
They fall their crests and like deceitful jades
Sink in the trial Comes his army on

LUCILIUS
They meant his night in Sard is to be quarterd
The greater part the Horse in general
Are come with Cassius

March within

BRUTUS
Hark he is arrived
March gently on to meet him

Enter Cassius and Soldiers

CASSIUS
Stand ho

BRUTUS
Stand ho Speak the word along

FIRST SOLDIER
Stand

SECOND SOLDIER
Stand

THIRD SOLDIER
Stand

CASSIUS
Most noble brother you have done me wrong

BRUTUS
Judge me you gods wrong I mine enemies
And if not so how should I wrong a brother

CASSIUS
Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
And when you do them

BRUTUS
Cassius be content
Speak your griefs softly I do know you well
Before the eyes of both our armies here
Which should perceive nothing but love from us
Let us not wrangle bid them move away
Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs
And I will give you audience

CASSIUS
Pindarus
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground

BRUTUS
Lucilius do you the like and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference
Lucius and Titinius guard our door

Exeunt



SCENE III within the tent of Brutus

Enter Brutus and Cassius

CASSIUS
That you have wrongd me doth appear in this
You have condemnd and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians
Whereas my letters praying on his side
Because I knew the man were slighted off

BRUTUS
You wrongd yourself to write in such a case

CASSIUS
In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offense should bear his comment

BRUTUS
Let me tell you Cassius you yourself
Are much condemnd to have an itching palm
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers

CASSIUS
I an itching palm
You know that you are Brutus that speak this
Or by the gods this speech were else your last

BRUTUS
The name of Cassius honors this corruption
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head

CASSIUS
Chastisement

BRUTUS
Remember March the Ides of March remember
Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake
What villain touchd his body that did stab
And not for justice What shall one of us
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbersshall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
And sell the mighty space of our large honours
For so much trash as may be grasped thus
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon
Than such a Roman

CASSIUS
Brutus bay not me
Ill not endure it you forget yourself
To hedge me in I am a soldier ay
Older in practice abler than yourself
To make conditions

BRUTUS
Go to you are not Cassius

CASSIUS
I am

BRUTUS
I say you are not

CASSIUS
Urge me no more I shall forget myself
Have mind upon your health tempt me no farther

BRUTUS
Away slight man

CASSIUS
Ist possible

BRUTUS
Hear me for I will speak
Must I give way and room to your rash choler
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares

CASSIUS
O gods ye gods must I endure all this

BRUTUS
All this ay more fret till your proud heart break
Go show your slaves how choleric you are
And make your bondmen tremble Must I budge
Must I observe you Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen
Though it do split you for from this day forth
Ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
When you are waspish

CASSIUS
Is it come to this

BRUTUS
You say you are a better soldier
Let it appear so make your vaunting true
And it shall please me well for mine own part
I shall be glad to learn of abler men

CASSIUS
You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
I said an elder soldier not a better
Did I say better

BRUTUS
If you did I care not

CASSIUS
When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me

BRUTUS
Peace peace you durst not so have tempted him

CASSIUS
I durst not

BRUTUS
No

CASSIUS
What durst not tempt him

BRUTUS
For your life you durst not

CASSIUS
Do not presume too much upon my love
I may do that I shall be sorry for

BRUTUS
You have done that you should be sorry for
There is no terror Cassius in your threats
For I am armd so strong in honesty
That they pass by me as the idle wind
Which I respect not I did send to you
For certain sums of gold which you denied me
For I can raise no money by vile means
By Heaven I had rather coin my heart
And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirectionI did send
To you for gold to pay my legions
Which you denied me was that done like Cassius
Should I have answerd Caius Cassius so
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
To lock such rascal counters from his friends
Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
Dash him to pieces

CASSIUS
I denied you not

BRUTUS
You did

CASSIUS
I did not He was but a fool
That brought my answer back Brutus hath rived my heart
A friend should bear his friends infirmities
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are

BRUTUS
I do not till you practise them on me

CASSIUS
You love me not

BRUTUS
I do not like your faults

CASSIUS
A friendly eye could never see such faults

BRUTUS
A flatterers would not though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus

CASSIUS
Come Antony and young Octavius come
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius
For Cassius is aweary of the world
Hated by one he loves braved by his brother
Checkd like a bondman all his faults observed
Set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote
To cast into my teeth O I could weep
My spirit from mine eyesThere is my dagger
And here my naked breast within a heart
Dearer than Plutus mine richer than gold
If that thou best a Roman take it forth
I that denied thee gold will give my heart
Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know
When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius

BRUTUS
Sheathe your dagger
Be angry when you will it shall have scope
Do what you will dishonor shall be humour
O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb
That carries anger as the flint bears fire
Who much enforced shows a hasty spark
And straight is cold again

CASSIUS
Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
When grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him

BRUTUS
When I spoke that I was illtemperd too

CASSIUS
Do you confess so much Give me your hand

BRUTUS
And my heart too

CASSIUS
O Brutus

BRUTUS
Whats the matter

CASSIUS
Have not you love enough to bear with me
When that rash humor which my mother gave me
Makes me forgetful

BRUTUS
Yes Cassius and from henceforth
When you are overearnest with your Brutus
Hell think your mother chides and leave you so

Noise within

POET
Within Let me go in to see the generals
There is some grudge between em tis not meet
They be alone

LUCILIUS
Within You shall not come to them

POET
Within Nothing but death shall stay me

Enter Poet followed by Lucilius and Titinius

CASSIUS
How now Whats the matter

POET
For shame you generals what do you mean
Love and be friends as two such men should be
For I have seen more years Im sure than ye

CASSIUS
Ha ha How vilely doth this cynic rhyme

BRUTUS
Get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence

CASSIUS
Bear with him Brutus tis his fashion

BRUTUS
Ill know his humor when he knows his time
What should the wars do with these jigging fools
Companion hence

CASSIUS
Away away be gone

Exit Poet

BRUTUS
Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies tonight

CASSIUS
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us

Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius

BRUTUS
Lucius a bowl of wine

Exit Lucius

CASSIUS
I did not think you could have been so angry

BRUTUS
O Cassius I am sick of many griefs

CASSIUS
Of your philosophy you make no use
If you give place to accidental evils

BRUTUS
No man bears sorrow better Portia is dead

CASSIUS
Ha Portia

BRUTUS
She is dead

CASSIUS
How scaped I killing when I crossd you so
O insupportable and touching loss
Upon what sickness

BRUTUS
Impatient of my absence
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
Have made themselves so strongfor with her death
That tidings camewith this she fell distract
And her attendants absent swallowd fire

CASSIUS
And died so

BRUTUS
Even so

CASSIUS
O ye immortal gods

Reenter Lucius with wine and a taper

BRUTUS
Speak no more of herGive me a bowl of wine
In this I bury all unkindness Cassius

Drinks

CASSIUS
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
Fill Lucius till the wine oerswell the cup
I cannot drink too much of Brutus love

Drinks

BRUTUS
Come in Titinius

Exit Lucius

Reenter Titinius with Messala

Welcome good Messala
Now sit we close about this taper here
And call in question our necessities

CASSIUS
Portia art thou gone

BRUTUS
No more I pray you
Messala I have here received letters
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power
Bending their expedition toward Philippi

MESSALA
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenour

BRUTUS
With what addition

MESSALA
That by proscription and bills of outlawry
Octavius Antony and Lepidus
Have put to death an hundred Senators

BRUTUS
There in our letters do not well agree
Mine speak of seventy Senators that died
By their proscriptions Cicero being one

CASSIUS
Cicero one

MESSALA
Cicero is dead
And by that order of proscription
Had you your letters from your wife my lord

BRUTUS
No Messala

MESSALA
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her

BRUTUS
Nothing Messala

MESSALA
That methinks is strange

BRUTUS
Why ask you hear you aught of her in yours

MESSALA
No my lord

BRUTUS
Now as you are a Roman tell me true

MESSALA
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell
For certain she is dead and by strange manner

BRUTUS
Why farewell Portia We must die Messala
With meditating that she must die once
I have the patience to endure it now

MESSALA
Even so great men great losses should endure

CASSIUS
I have as much of this in art as you
But yet my nature could not bear it so

BRUTUS
Well to our work alive What do you think
Of marching to Philippi presently

CASSIUS
I do not think it good

BRUTUS
Your reason

CASSIUS
This it is
Tis better that the enemy seek us
So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
Doing himself offense whilst we lying still
Are full of rest defense and nimbleness

BRUTUS
Good reasons must of force give place to better
The people twixt Philippi and this ground
Do stand but in a forced affection
For they have grudged us contribution
The enemy marching along by them
By them shall make a fuller number up
Come on refreshd newadded and encouraged
From which advantage shall we cut him off
If at Philippi we do face him there
These people at our back

CASSIUS
Hear me good brother

BRUTUS
Under your pardon You must note besides
That we have tried the utmost of our friends
Our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe
The enemy increaseth every day
We at the height are ready to decline
There is a tide in the affairs of men
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
Omitted all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries
On such a full sea are we now afloat
And we must take the current when it serves
Or lose our ventures

CASSIUS
Then with your will go on
Well along ourselves and meet them at Philippi

BRUTUS
The deep of night is crept upon our talk
And nature must obey necessity
Which we will niggard with a little rest
There is no more to say

CASSIUS
No more Good night
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence

BRUTUS
LuciusMy gownFarewell now good Messala
Good night Titiniusnoble noble Cassius
Good night and good repose

CASSIUS
O my dear brother
This was an ill beginning of the night
Never come such division tween our souls
Let it not Brutus

BRUTUS
Every thing is well

CASSIUS
Good night my lord

BRUTUS
Good night good brother

BRUTUS

ACT V

SCENE I The plains of Philippi

Enter Octavius Antony and their Army

OCTAVIUS
Now Antony our hopes are answered
You said the enemy would not come down
But keep the hills and upper regions
It proves not so their battles are at hand
They mean to warn us at Philippi here
Answering before we do demand of them

ANTONY
Tut I am in their bosoms and I know
Wherefore they do it they could be content
To visit other places and come down
With fearful bravery thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
But tis not so

Enter a Messenger

MESSENGER
Prepare you generals
The enemy comes on in gallant show
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out
And something to be done immediately

ANTONY
Octavius lead your battle softly on
Upon the left hand of the even field

OCTAVIUS
Upon the right hand I keep thou the left

ANTONY
Why do you cross me in this exigent

OCTAVIUS
I do not cross you but I will do so

March Drum Enter Brutus Cassius and their Army
Lucilius Titinius Messala and Others

BRUTUS
They stand and would have parley

CASSIUS
Stand fast Titinius we must out and talk

OCTAVIUS
Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle

ANTONY
No Caesar we will answer on their charge
Make forth the generals would have some words

OCTAVIUS
Stir not until the signal

BRUTUS
Words before blows is it so countrymen

OCTAVIUS
Not that we love words better as you do

BRUTUS
Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius

ANTONY
In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
Witness the hole you made in Caesars heart
Crying Long live Hail Caesar

CASSIUS
Antony
The posture of your blows are yet unknown
But for your words they rob the Hybla bees
And leave them honeyless

ANTONY
Not stingless too

BRUTUS
O yes and soundless too
For you have stoln their buzzing Antony
And very wisely threat before you sting

ANTONY
Villains you did not so when your vile daggers
Hackd one another in the sides of Caesar
You showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds
And bowd like bondmen kissing Caesars feet
Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind
Struck Caesar on the neck O flatterers

CASSIUS
FlatterersNow Brutus thank yourself
This tongue had not offended so today
If Cassius might have ruled

OCTAVIUS
Come come the cause if arguing makes us sweat
The proof of it will turn to redder drops
Look
I draw a sword against conspirators
When think you that the sword goes up again
Never till Caesars three and thirty wounds
Be well avenged or till another Caesar
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors

BRUTUS
Caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
Unless thou bringst them with thee

OCTAVIUS
So I hope
I was not born to die on Brutus sword

BRUTUS
O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
Young man thou couldst not die more honourably

CASSIUS
A peevish school boy worthless of such honour
Joind with a masker and a reveller

ANTONY
Old Cassius still

OCTAVIUS
Come Antony away
Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
If you dare fight today come to the field
If not when you have stomachs

Exeunt Octavius Antony and their Army

CASSIUS
Why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
The storm is up and all is on the hazard

BRUTUS
Ho Lucilius Hark a word with you

LUCILIUS
My lord

Brutus and Lucilius talk apart

CASSIUS
Messala

MESSALA
What says my General

CASSIUS
Messala
This is my birthday as this very day
Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala
Be thou my witness that against my will
As Pompey was am I compelld to set
Upon one battle all our liberties
You know that I held Epicurus strong
And his opinion now I change my mind
And partly credit things that do presage
Coming from Sardis on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
Who to Philippi here consorted us
This morning are they fled away and gone
And in their steads do ravens crows and kites
Fly oer our heads and downward look on us
As we were sickly prey their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal under which
Our army lies ready to give up the ghost

MESSALA
Believe not so

CASSIUS
I but believe it partly
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly

BRUTUS
Even so Lucilius

CASSIUS
Now most noble Brutus
The gods today stand friendly that we may
Lovers in peace lead on our days to age
But since th affairs of men rest still incertain
Lets reason with the worst that may befall
If we do lose this battle then is this
The very last time we shall speak together
What are you then determined to do

BRUTUS
Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himselfI know not how
But I do find it cowardly and vile
For fear of what might fall so to prevent
The time of lifearming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below

CASSIUS
Then if we lose this battle
You are contented to be led in triumph
Thorough the streets of Rome

BRUTUS
No Cassius no think not thou noble Roman
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome
He bears too great a mind But this same day
Must end that work the Ides of March begun
And whether we shall meet again I know not
Therefore our everlasting farewell take
For ever and for ever farewell Cassius
If we do meet again why we shall smile
If not why then this parting was well made

CASSIUS
For ever and for ever farewell Brutus
If we do meet again well smile indeed
If not tis true this parting was well made

BRUTUS
Why then lead on O that a man might know
The end of this days business ere it come
But it sufficeth that the day will end
And then the end is knownCome ho away

Exeunt



SCENE II The same The field of battle

Alarum Enter Brutus and Messala

BRUTUS
Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side
Let them set on at once for I perceive
But cold demeanor in Octavius wing
And sudden push gives them the overthrow
Ride ride Messala let them all come down

Exeunt



SCENE III Another part of the field

Alarum Enter Cassius and Titinius

CASSIUS
O look Titinius look the villains fly
Myself have to mine own turnd enemy
This ensign here of mine was turning back
I slew the coward and did take it from him

TITINIUS
O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early
Who having some advantage on Octavius
Took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed

Enter Pindarus

PINDARUS
Fly further off my lord fly further off
Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off

CASSIUS
This hill is far enoughLook look Titinius
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire

TITINIUS
They are my lord

CASSIUS
Titinius if thou lovest me
Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
And here again that I may rest assured
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy

TITINIUS
I will be here again even with a thought

Exit

CASSIUS
Go Pindarus get higher on that hill
My sight was ever thick regard Titinius
And tell me what thou notest about the field

Pindarus goes up

This day I breathed first time is come round
And where I did begin there shall I end
My life is run his compassSirrah what news

PINDARUS
Above O my lord

CASSIUS
What news

PINDARUS
Above Titinius is enclosed round about
With horsemen that make to him on the spur
Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him
Now TitiniusNow some light O he lights too
Hes taen Shout and hark they shout for joy

CASSIUS
Come down behold no more
O coward that I am to live so long
To see my best friend taen before my face

Pindarus descends

Come hither sirrah
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner
And then I swore thee saving of thy life
That whatsoever I did bid thee do
Thou shouldst attempt it Come now keep thine oath
Now be a freeman and with this good sword
That ran through Caesars bowels search this bosom
Stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
And when my face is coverd as tis now
Guide thou the swordCaesar thou art revenged
Even with the sword that killd thee

Dies

PINDARUS
So I am free yet would not so have been
Durst I have done my willO Cassius
Far from this country Pindarus shall run
Where never Roman shall take note of him

Exit

Reenter Titinius with Messala

MESSALA
It is but change Titinius for Octavius
Is overthrown by noble Brutus power
As Cassius legions are by Antony

TITINIUS
These tidings would well comfort Cassius

MESSALA
Where did you leave him

TITINIUS
All disconsolate
With Pindarus his bondman on this hill

MESSALA
Is not that he that lies upon the ground

TITINIUS
He lies not like the living O my heart

MESSALA
Is not that he

TITINIUS
No this was he Messala
But Cassius is no moreO setting Sun
As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night
So in his red blood Cassius day is set
The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone
Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed

MESSALA
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed
O hateful Error Melancholys child
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
The things that are not O Error soon conceived
Thou never comest unto a happy birth
But killst the mother that engenderd thee

TITINIUS
What Pindarus where art thou Pindarus

MESSALA
Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet
The noble Brutus thrusting this report
Into his ears I may say thrusting it
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight

TITINIUS
Hie you Messala
And I will seek for Pindarus the while

Exit Messala
Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius
Did I not meet thy friends And did not they
Put on my brows this wreath of victory
And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts
Alas thou hast misconstrued every thing
But hold thee take this garland on thy brow
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I
Will do his biddingBrutus come apace
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius
By your leave gods this is a Romans part
Come Cassius sword and find Titinius heart

Dies

Alarum Reenter Messala with Brutus young Cato
Strato Volumnius and Lucilius

BRUTUS
Where where Messala doth his body lie

MESSALA
Lo yonder and Titinius mourning it

BRUTUS
Titinius face is upward

CATO
He is slain

BRUTUS
O Julius Caesar thou art mighty yet
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails

Low alarums

CATO
Brave Titinius
Look whether he have not crownd dead Cassius

BRUTUS
Are yet two Romans living such as these
The last of all the Romans fare thee well
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellowFriends I owe more tears
To this dead man than you shall see me pay
I shall find time Cassius I shall find time
Come therefore and to Thassos send his body
His funerals shall not be in our camp
Lest it discomfort usLucilius come
And come young Catolet us to the field
Labeo and Flavius set our battles on
Tis three oclock and Romans yet ere night
We shall try fortune in a second fight

Exeunt

Safe Antony Brutus is safe enough

Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus
The gods defend him from so great a shame
When you do find him or alive or dead
He will be found like Brutus like himself

ANTONY
This is not Brutus friend but I assure you
A prize no less in worth Keep this man safe
Give him all kindness I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies Go on
And see whether Brutus be alive or dead
And bring us word unto Octavius tent
How everything is chanced

Exeunt

DARDANIUS
To kill him Clitus Look he meditates

CLITUS
Now is that noble vessel full of grief
That it runs over even at his eyes

BRUTUS
Come hither good Volumnius list a word

VOLUMNIUS

BRUTUS
Why this Volumnius
The ghost of Caesar hath appeard to me
Two several times by night at Sardis once
And this last night here in Philippi fields
I know my hour is come

VOLUMNIUS
Not so my lord

BRUTUS
Nay I am sure it is Volumnius
Thou seest the world Volumnius how it goes
Our enemies have beat us to the pit

Low alarums

It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
Than tarry till they push us Good Volumnius
Thou knowst that we two went to school together
Even for that our love of old I prythee
Hold thou my swordhilts whilst I run on it

VOLUMNIUS
Thats not an office for a friend my lord

Alarums still

BRUTUS
Farewell to youand youand you Volumnius
Strato thou hast been all this while asleep
Farewell to thee too StratoCountrymen
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto
So fare you well at once for Brutus tongue
Hath almost ended his lifes history
Night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest
That have but labourd to attain this hour

Alarums Cry within Fly fly fly

CLITUS
Fly my lord fly

BRUTUS
Hence I will follow

Exeunt Clitus Dardanius and Volumnius

I prythee Strato stay thou by thy lord
Thou art a fellow of a good respect
Thy life hath had some smack of honor in it
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face
While I do run upon it Wilt thou Strato

STRATO
Give me your hand first fare you well my lord

BRUTUS
Farewell good StratoCaesar now be still
I killd not thee with half so good a will

He runs on his sword and dies

Alarum Retreat Enter Octavius Antony Messala Lucilius and
Army

OCTAVIUS
What man is that

MESSALA
My masters manStrato where is thy master

STRATO
Free from the bondage you are in Messala
The conquerors can but make a fire of him
For Brutus only overcame himself
And no man else hath honour by his death

LUCILIUS
So Brutus should be foundI thank thee Brutus
That thou hast proved Lucilius saying true

OCTAVIUS
All that served Brutus I will entertain them
Fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me

STRATO
Ay if Messala will prefer me to you

OCTAVIUS
Do so good Messala

MESSALA
How died my master Strato

STRATO
I held the sword and he did run on it

MESSALA
Octavius then take him to follow thee
That did the latest service to my master

ANTONY
This was the noblest Roman of them all
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar
He only in a generalhonest thought
And common good to all made one of them
His life was gentle and the elements
So mixd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world This was a man

OCTAVIUS
According to his virtue let us use him
With all respect and rites of burial
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie
Most like a soldier orderd honorably
So call the field to rest and lets away
To part the glories of this happy day

Exeunt
