The Land God Forgot



 The lonely sunsets flare forlorn
 Down valleys dreadly desolate
 The lordly mountains soar in scorn
 As still as death as stern as fate

 _The lonely sunsets flame and die
 The giant valleys gulp the night
 The monster mountains scrape the sky
 Where eager stars are diamondbright_

 So gaunt against the gibbous moon
 Piercing the silence velvetpiled
 A lone wolf howls his ancient rune 
 The fell archspirit of the Wild

 _O outcast land O leper land
 Let the lone wolfcry all express
 The hate insensate of thy hand
 Thy hearts abysmal loneliness_

The Spell of the Yukon



 I wanted the gold and I sought it
 I scrabbled and mucked like a slave
 Was it famine or scurvy  I fought it
 I hurled my youth into a grave
 I wanted the gold and I got it 
 Came out with a fortune last fall 
 Yet somehow lifes not what I thought it
 And somehow the gold isnt all

 No Theres the land Have you seen it
 Its the cussedest land that I know
 From the big dizzy mountains that screen it
 To the deep deathlike valleys below
 Some say God was tired when He made it
 Some say its a fine land to shun
 Maybe but theres some as would trade it
 For no land on earth  and Im one

 You come to get rich damned good reason
 You feel like an exile at first
 You hate it like hell for a season
 And then you are worse than the worst
 It grips you like some kinds of sinning
 It twists you from foe to a friend
 It seems its been since the beginning
 It seems it will be to the end

 Ive stood in some mightymouthed hollow
 Thats plumbfull of hush to the brim
 Ive watched the big husky sun wallow
 In crimson and gold and grow dim
 Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming
 And the stars tumbled out neck and crop
 And Ive thought that I surely was dreaming
 With the peace o the world piled on top

 The summer  no sweeter was ever
 The sunshiny woods all athrill
 The grayling aleap in the river
 The bighorn asleep on the hill
 The strong life that never knows harness
 The wilds where the caribou call
 The freshness the freedom the farness 
 O God how Im stuck on it all

 The winter the brightness that blinds you
 The white land locked tight as a drum
 The cold fear that follows and finds you
 The silence that bludgeons you dumb
 The snows that are older than history
 The woods where the weird shadows slant
 The stillness the moonlight the mystery
 Ive bade em goodby  but I cant

 Theres a land where the mountains are nameless
 And the rivers all run God knows where
 There are lives that are erring and aimless
 And deaths that just hang by a hair
 There are hardships that nobody reckons
 There are valleys unpeopled and still
 Theres a land  oh it beckons and beckons
 And I want to go back  and I will

 Theyre making my money diminish
 Im sick of the taste of champagne
 Thank God when Im skinned to a finish
 Ill pike to the Yukon again
 Ill fight  and you bet its no shamfight
 Its hell  but Ive been there before
 And its better than this by a damsite 
 So me for the Yukon once more

 Theres gold and its haunting and haunting
 Its luring me on as of old
 Yet it isnt the gold that Im wanting
 So much as just finding the gold
 Its the great big broad land way up yonder
 Its the forests where silence has lease
 Its the beauty that thrills me with wonder
 Its the stillness that fills me with peace




The Heart of the Sourdough



 There where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon
 There where the sullen sundogs glare in the snowbright bitter noon
 And the glacierglutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of June

 There where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows
 There where the silences are spawned and the light of hellfire flows
 Into the bowl of the midnight sky violet amber and rose

 There where the rapids churn and roar and the icefloes bellowing run
 Where the tortured twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun 
 Ive packed my kit and Im going boys ere another day is done

     

 I knew it would call or soon or late as it calls the whirring wings
 Its the olden lure its the golden lure
 its the lure of the timeless things
 And tonight oh God of the trails untrod
 how it whines in my heartstrings

 Im sick to death of your wellgroomed gods your make believe and your show
 I long for a whiff of bacon and beans a snug shakedown in the snow
 A trail to break and a life at stake and another bout with the foe

 With the rawribbed Wild that abhors all life
 the Wild that would crush and rend
 I have clinched and closed with the naked North
 I have learned to defy and defend
 Shoulder to shoulder we have fought it out 
 yet the Wild must win in the end

 I have flouted the Wild I have followed its lure
 fearless familiar alone
 By all that the battle means and makes I claim that land for mine own
 Yet the Wild must win and a day will come when I shall be overthrown

 Then when as wolfdogs fight weve fought the lean wolfland and I
 Fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky
 Even as lean wolfdog goes down will I go down and die




The Three Voices



 The waves have a story to tell me
 As I lie on the lonely beach
 Chanting aloft in the pinetops
 The wind has a lesson to teach
 But the stars sing an anthem of glory
 I cannot put into speech

 The waves tell of ocean spaces
 Of hearts that are wild and brave
 Of populous city places
 Of desolate shores they lave
 Of men who sally in quest of gold
 To sink in an ocean grave

 The wind is a mighty roamer
 He bids me keep me free
 Clean from the taint of the goldlust
 Hardy and pure as he
 Cling with my love to nature
 As a child to the motherknee

 But the stars throng out in their glory
 And they sing of the God in man
 They sing of the Mighty Master
 Of the loom his fingers span
 Where a star or a soul is a part of the whole
 And weft in the wondrous plan

 Here by the campfires flicker
 Deep in my blanket curled
 I long for the peace of the pinegloom
 When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled
 And the wind and the wave are silent
 And world is singing to world




The Law of the Yukon



 This is the law of the Yukon and ever she makes it plain
 Send not your foolish and feeble send me your strong and your sane 
 Strong for the red rage of battle sane for I harry them sore
 Send me men girt for the combat men who are grit to the core
 Swift as the panther in triumph fierce as the bear in defeat
 Sired of a bulldog parent steeled in the furnace heat
 Send me the best of your breeding lend me your chosen ones
 Them will I take to my bosom them will I call my sons
 Them will I gild with my treasure them will I glut with my meat
 But the others  the misfits the failures  I trample under my feet
 Dissolute damned and despairful crippled and palsied and slain
 Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters  Go take back your spawn again

 Wild and wide are my borders stern as death is my sway
 From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a day
 Hugging my mighty treasure waiting for man to come
 Till he swept like a turbid torrent and after him swept  the scum
 The pallid pimp of the deadline the enervate of the pen
 One by one I weeded them out for all that I sought was  Men
 One by one I dismayed them frighting them sore with my glooms
 One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms
 Drowned them like rats in my rivers starved them like curs on my plains
 Rotted the flesh that was left them poisoned the blood in their veins
 Burst with my winter upon them searing forever their sight
 Lashed them with funguswhite faces whimpering wild in the night

 Staggering blind through the stormwhirl stumbling mad through the snow
 Frozen stiff in the icepack brittle and bent like a bow
 Featureless formless forsaken scented by wolves in their flight
 Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white
 Gnawing the black crust of failure searching the pit of despair
 Crooking the toe in the trigger trying to patter a prayer
 Going outside with an escort raving with lips all afoam
 Writing a cheque for a million driveling feebly of home
 Lost like a louse in the burning or else in the tented town
 Seeking a drunkards solace sinking and sinking down
 Steeped in the slime at the bottom dead to a decent world
 Lost mid the human flotsam far on the frontier hurled
 In the camp at the bend of the river with its dozen saloons aglare
 Its gambling dens ariot its gramophones all ablare
 Crimped with the crimes of a city sinridden and bridled with lies
 In the hush of my mountained vastness in the flush of my midnight skies
 Plaguespots yet tools of my purpose so natheless I suffer them thrive
 Crushing my Weak in their clutches that only my Strong may survive

 But the others the men of my mettle the men who would stablish my fame
 Unto its ultimate issue winning me honor not shame
 Searching my uttermost valleys fighting each step as they go
 Shooting the wrath of my rapids scaling my ramparts of snow
 Ripping the guts of my mountains looting the beds of my creeks
 Them will I take to my bosom and speak as a mother speaks
 I am the land that listens I am the land that broods
 Steeped in eternal beauty crystalline waters and woods
 Long have I waited lonely shunned as a thing accurst
 Monstrous moody pathetic the last of the lands and the first
 Visioning campfires at twilight sad with a longing forlorn
 Feeling my womb oerpregnant with the seed of cities unborn
 Wild and wide are my borders stern as death is my sway
 And I wait for the men who will win me  and I will not be won in a day
 And I will not be won by weaklings subtle suave and mild
 But by men with the hearts of vikings and the simple faith of a child
 Desperate strong and resistless unthrottled by fear or defeat
 Them will I gild with my treasure them will I glut with my meat

 Lofty I stand from each sister land patient and wearily wise
 With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet passionless eyes
 Dreaming alone of a people dreaming alone of a day
 When men shall not rape my riches and curse me and go away
 Making a bawd of my bounty fouling the hand that gave 
 Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path
 and I stamp them into a grave
 Dreaming of men who will bless me of women esteeming me good
 Of children born in my borders of radiant motherhood
 Of cities leaping to stature of fame like a flag unfurled
 As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world

 This is the Law of the Yukon that only the Strong shall thrive
 That surely the Weak shall perish and only the Fit survive
 Dissolute damned and despairful crippled and palsied and slain
 This is the Will of the Yukon  Lo how she makes it plain




The Parsons Son



 _This is the song of the parsons son as he squats in his shack alone
 On the wild weird nights when the Northern Lights
 shoot up from the frozen zone
 And its sixty below and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan_

 Im one of the Arctic brotherhood Im an oldtime pioneer
 I came with the first  O God how Ive cursed
 this Yukon  but still Im here
 Ive sweated athirst in its summer heat Ive frozen and starved in its cold
 Ive followed my dreams by its thousand streams
 Ive toiled and moiled for its gold

 Look at my eyes  been snowblind twice look where my foots half gone
 And that gruesome scar on my left cheek
 where the frostfiend bit to the bone
 Each one a brand of this devils land
 where Ive played and Ive lost the game
 A broken wreck with a craze for hooch and never a cent to my name

 This mining is only a gamble the worst is as good as the best
 I was in with the bunch and I might have come out right on top with the rest
 With Cormack Ladue and Macdonald  O God but its hell to think
 Of the thousands and thousands Ive squandered on cards and women and drink

 In the early days we were just a few and we hunted and fished around
 Nor dreamt by our lonely campfires of the wealth that lay under the ground
 We traded in skins and whiskey and Ive often slept under the shade
 Of that lone birch tree on Bonanza where the first big find was made

 We were just like a great big family and every man had his squaw
 And we lived such a wild free fearless life beyond the pale of the law
 Till sudden there came a whisper and it maddened us every man
 And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began

 Oh those Dawson days and the sin and the blaze
 and the town all open wide
 If God made me in His likeness sure He let the devil inside
 But we all were mad both the good and the bad and as for the women well 
 No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell

 Money was just like dirt there easy to get and to spend
 I was all caked in on a dancehall jade but she shook me in the end
 It put me queer and for near a year I never drew sober breath
 Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on death

 Twenty years in the Yukon struggling along its creeks
 Roaming its giant valleys scaling its godlike peaks
 Bathed in its fiery sunsets fighting its fiendish cold 
 Twenty years in the Yukon twenty years  and Im old

 Old and weak but no matter theres hooch in the bottle still
 Ill hitch up the dogs tomorrow and mush down the trail to Bill
 Its so long dark and Im lonesome  Ill just lay down on the bed
 Tomorrow Ill go tomorrow I guess Ill play on the red

  Come Kit your pony is saddled
 Im waiting dear in the court
  Minnie you devil Ill kill you
 if you skip with that flossy sport
  How much does it go to the pan Bill
 play up School and play the game
  Our Father which art in heaven hallowed be Thy name

 _This was the song of the parsons son as he lay in his bunk alone
 Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in
 and his blue lips ceased to moan
 And the hungermaddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone_




The Call of the Wild



 Have you gazed on naked grandeur where theres nothing else to gaze on
 Set pieces and dropcurtain scenes galore
 Big mountains heaved to heaven which the blinding sunsets blazon
 Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar
 Have you swept the visioned valley
 with the green stream streaking through it
 Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost
 Have you strung your soul to silence Then for Gods sake go and do it
 Hear the challenge learn the lesson pay the cost

 Have you wandered in the wilderness the sagebrush desolation
 The bunchgrass levels where the cattle graze
 Have you whistled bits of ragtime at the end of all creation
 And learned to know the deserts little ways
 Have you camped upon the foothills have you galloped oer the ranges
 Have you roamed the arid sunlands through and through
 Have you chummed up with the mesa Do you know its moods and changes
 Then listen to the Wild  its calling you

 Have you known the Great White Silence not a snowgemmed twig aquiver
 Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies
 Have you broken trail on snowshoes mushed your huskies up the river
 Dared the unknown led the way and clutched the prize
 Have you marked the maps void spaces mingled with the mongrel races
 Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew
 And though grim as hell the worst is can you round it off with curses
 Then hearken to the Wild  its wanting you

 Have you suffered starved and triumphed
 groveled down yet grasped at glory
 Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole
 Done things just for the doing letting babblers tell the story
 Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul
 Have you seen God in His splendors heard the text that nature renders
 Youll never hear it in the family pew
 The simple things the true things the silent men who do things 
 Then listen to the Wild  its calling you

 They have cradled you in custom they have primed you with their preaching
 They have soaked you in convention through and through
 They have put you in a showcase youre a credit to their teaching 
 But cant you hear the Wild  its calling you
 Let us probe the silent places let us seek what luck betide us
 Let us journey to a lonely land I know
 Theres a whisper on the nightwind theres a star agleam to guide us
 And the Wild is calling calling let us go




The Lone Trail



 _Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it
 Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit
 Ye who take the Lone Trail bid your love goodby
 The Lone Trail the Lone Trail follow till you die_

 The trails of the world be countless and most of the trails be tried
 You tread on the heels of the many till you come where the ways divide
 And one lies safe in the sunlight and the other is dreary and wan
 Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail and the Lone Trail lures you on
 And somehow youre sick of the highway with its noise and its easy needs
 And you seek the risk of the byway and you reck not where it leads
 And sometimes it leads to the desert and the tongue swells out of the mouth
 And you stagger blind to the mirage to die in the mocking drouth
 And sometimes it leads to the mountain to the light of the lone campfire
 And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hungergoaded desire
 And sometimes it leads to the Southland to the swamp where the orchid glows
 And you rave to your grave with the fever
 and they rob the corpse for its clothes
 And sometimes it leads to the Northland and the scurvy softens your bones
 And your flesh dints in like putty and you spit out your teeth like stones
 And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea
 And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily
 And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail
 and the snows where your torn feet freeze
 And you whittle away the useless clay and crawl on your hands and knees
 Often it leads to the deadpit always it leads to pain
 By the bones of your brothers ye know it but oh to follow youre fain
 By your bones they will follow behind you
 till the ways of the world are made plain

 _Bid goodby to sweetheart bid goodby to friend
 The Lone Trail the Lone Trail follow to the end
 Tarry not and fear not chosen of the true
 Lover of the Lone Trail the Lone Trail waits for you_




The Pines



 We sleep in the sleep of ages the bleak barbarian pines
 The gray moss drapes us like sages and closer we lock our lines
 And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam shines

 On the flanks of the stormgored ridges are our black battalions massed
 We surge in a host to the sullen coast and we sing in the ocean blast
 From empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast

 To the niggard lands were we driven twixt desert and floes are we penned
 To us was the Northland given ours to stronghold and defend
 Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end

 Ours from the bleak beginning through the aeons of deathlike sleep
 Ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing deep
 Ours through the twilight ages of weary glacier creep

 Wind of the East Wind of the West wandering to and fro
 Chant your songs in our topmost boughs that the sons of men may know
 The peerless pine was the first to come and the pine will be last to go

 We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom we plume where the eagles soar
 The Northwind swoops from the brooding Pole
 and our ancients crash and roar
 But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score

 We spring from the gloom of the canyons womb in the valleys lap we lie
 From the white foamfringe where the breakers cringe
 to the peaks that tusk the sky
 We climb and we peer in the craglocked mere that gleams like a golden eye

 Gain to the verge of the hogback ridge where the vision ranges free
 Pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see
 A steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery

 Sun moon and stars give answer shall we not staunchly stand
 Even as now forever wards of the wilder strand
 Sentinels of the stillness lords of the last lone land




The Lure of Little Voices



 Theres a cry from out the loneliness  oh listen Honey listen
 Do you hear it do you fear it youre aholding of me so
 Youre asobbing in your sleep dear and your lashes how they glisten 
 Do you hear the Little Voices all abegging me to go

 All abegging me to leave you Day and night theyre pleading praying
 On the Northwind on the Westwind from the peak and from the plain
 Night and day they never leave me  do you know what they are saying
 He was ours before you got him and we want him once again

 Yes theyre wanting me theyre haunting me the awful lonely places
 Theyre whining and theyre whimpering as if each had a soul
 Theyre calling from the wilderness the vast and Godlike spaces
 The stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole

 They miss my little campfires ever brightly bravely gleaming
 In the womb of desolation where was never man before
 As comradeless I sought them lionhearted loving dreaming
 And they hailed me as a comrade and they loved me evermore

 And now theyre all acrying and its no use me denying
 The spell of them is on me and Im helpless as a child
 My heart is aching aching but I hear them sleeping waking
 Its the Lure of Little Voices its the mandate of the Wild

 Im afraid to tell you Honey I can take no bitter leaving
 But softly in the sleeptime from your love Ill steal away
 Oh its cruel dearie cruel and its God knows how Im grieving
 But His loneliness is calling and He knows I must obey




The Song of the WageSlave



 When the long long day is over and the Big Boss gives me my pay
 I hope that it wont be hellfire as some of the parsons say
 And I hope that it wont be heaven with some of the parsons Ive met 
 All I want is just quiet just to rest and forget
 Look at my face toilfurrowed look at my calloused hands
 Master Ive done Thy bidding wrought in Thy many lands 
 Wrought for the little masters bigbellied they be and rich
 Ive done their desire for a daily hire and I die like a dog in a ditch
 I have used the strength Thou hast given Thou knowest I did not shirk
 Threescore years of labor  Thine be the long days work
 And now Big Master Im broken and bent and twisted and scarred
 But Ive held my job and Thou knowest and Thou will not judge me hard
 Thou knowest my sins are many and often Ive played the fool 
 Whiskey and cards and women they made me the devils tool
 I was just like a child with money I flung it away with a curse
 Feasting a fawning parasite or glutting a harlots purse
 Then back to the woods repentant back to the mill or the mine
 I the worker of workers everything in my line
 Everything hard but headwork Id no more brains than a kid
 A brute with brute strength to labor doing as I was bid
 Living in camps with menfolk a lonely and loveless life
 Never knew kiss of sweetheart never caress of wife
 A brute with brute strength to labor and they were so far above 
 Yet Id gladly have gone to the gallows for one little look of Love
 I with the strength of two men savage and shy and wild 
 Yet how Id ha treasured a woman and the sweet warm kiss of a child
 Well tis Thy world and Thou knowest I blaspheme and my ways be rude
 But Ive lived my life as I found it and Ive done my best to be good
 I the primitive toiler half naked and grimed to the eyes
 Sweating it deep in their ditches swining it stark in their styes
 Hurling down forests before me spanning tumultuous streams
 Down in the ditch building oer me palaces fairer than dreams
 Boring the rock to the orebed driving the road through the fen
 Resolute dumb uncomplaining a man in a world of men
 Master Ive filled my contract wrought in Thy many lands
 Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me but by the work of my hands
 Master Ive done Thy bidding and the light is low in the west
 And the long long shift is over Master Ive earned it  Rest




Grin



 If youre up against a bruiser and youre getting knocked about 
 Grin
 If youre feeling pretty groggy and youre licked beyond a doubt 
 Grin
 Dont let him see youre funking let him know with every clout
 Though your face is battered to a pulp your blooming heart is stout
 Just stand upon your pins until the beggar knocks you out 
 And grin
 This lifes a bally battle and the same advice holds true
 Of grin
 If youre up against it badly then its only one on you
 So grin
 If the futures black as thunder dont let people see youre blue
 Just cultivate a castiron smile of joy the whole day through
 If they call you Little Sunshine wish that _THEYD_ no troubles too 
 You may  grin
 Rise up in the morning with the will that smooth or rough
 Youll grin
 Sink to sleep at midnight and although youre feeling tough
 Yet grin
 Theres nothing gained by whining and youre not that kind of stuff
 Youre a fighter from away back and you _WONT_ take a rebuff
 Your trouble is that you dont know when you have had enough 
 Dont give in
 If Fate should down you just get up and take another cuff
 You may bank on it that there is no philosophy like bluff
 And grin




The Shooting of Dan McGrew



 A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon
 The kid that handles the musicbox was hitting a jagtime tune
 Back of the bar in a solo game sat Dangerous Dan McGrew
 And watching his luck was his lightolove the lady thats known as Lou

 When out of the night which was fifty below and into the din and the glare
 There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks dogdirty and loaded for bear
 He looked like a man with a foot in the grave
 and scarcely the strength of a louse
 Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar
 and he called for drinks for the house
 There was none could place the strangers face
 though we searched ourselves for a clue
 But we drank his health and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan McGrew

 Theres men that somehow just grip your eyes
 and hold them hard like a spell
 And such was he and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell
 With a face most hair and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done
 As he watered the green stuff in his glass and the drops fell one by one
 Then I got to figgering who he was and wondering what hed do
 And I turned my head  and there watching him
 was the lady thats known as Lou

 His eyes went rubbering round the room and he seemed in a kind of daze
 Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze
 The ragtime kid was having a drink there was no one else on the stool
 So the stranger stumbles across the room and flops down there like a fool
 In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat and I saw him sway
 Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands
  my God but that man could play

 Were you ever out in the Great Alone when the moon was awful clear
 And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could _HEAR_
 With only the howl of a timber wolf and you camped there in the cold
 A halfdead thing in a stark dead world clean mad for the muck called gold
 While high overhead green yellow and red
 the North Lights swept in bars 
 Then youve a haunch what the music meant
 hunger and night and the stars

 And hunger not of the belly kind thats banished with bacon and beans
 But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means
 For a fireside far from the cares that are four walls and a roof above
 But oh so cramful of cosy joy and crowned with a womans love 
 A woman dearer than all the world and true as Heaven is true 
 God how ghastly she looks through her rouge 
 the lady thats known as Lou

 Then on a sudden the music changed so soft that you scarce could hear
 But you felt that your life had been looted clean
 of all that it once held dear
 That someone had stolen the woman you loved that her love was a devils lie
 That your guts were gone and the best for you was to crawl away and die
 Twas the crowning cry of a hearts despair
 and it thrilled you through and through 
 I guess Ill make it a spread misere said Dangerous Dan McGrew

 The music almost died away then it burst like a pentup flood
 And it seemed to say Repay repay and my eyes were blind with blood
 The thought came back of an ancient wrong and it stung like a frozen lash
 And the lust awoke to kill to kill
 then the music stopped with a crash
 And the stranger turned and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar way
 In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat and I saw him sway
 Then his lips went in in a kind of grin
 and he spoke and his voice was calm
 And Boys says he you dont know me and none of you care a damn
 But I want to state and my words are straight
 and Ill bet my poke theyre true
 That one of you is a hound of hell and that one is Dan McGrew

 Then I ducked my head and the lights went out
 and two guns blazed in the dark
 And a woman screamed and the lights went up
 and two men lay stiff and stark
 Pitched on his head and pumped full of lead was Dangerous Dan McGrew
 While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast
 of the lady thats known as Lou

 These are the simple facts of the case and I guess I ought to know
 They say that the stranger was crazed with hooch
 and Im not denying its so
 Im not so wise as the lawyer guys but strictly between us two 
 The woman that kissed him and  pinched his poke 
 was the lady thats known as Lou




The Cremation of Sam McGee



 _There are strange things done in the midnight sun
 By the men who moil for gold
 The Arctic trails have their secret tales
 That would make your blood run cold
 The Northern Lights have seen queer sights
 But the queerest they ever did see
 Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
 I cremated Sam McGee_

 Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee where the cotton blooms and blows
 Why he left his home in the South to roam round the Pole God only knows
 He was always cold but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell
 Though hed often say in his homely way that hed sooner live in hell

 On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail
 Talk of your cold through the parkas fold it stabbed like a driven nail
 If our eyes wed close then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldnt see
 It wasnt much fun but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee

 And that very night as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow
 And the dogs were fed and the stars oerhead were dancing heel and toe
 He turned to me and Cap says he Ill cash in this trip I guess
 And if I do Im asking that you wont refuse my last request

 Well he seemed so low that I couldnt say no
 then he says with a sort of moan
 Its the cursed cold and its got right hold
 till Im chilled clean through to the bone
 Yet taint being dead  its my awful dread of the icy grave that pains
 So I want you to swear that foul or fair youll cremate my last remains

 A pals last need is a thing to heed so I swore I would not fail
 And we started on at the streak of dawn but God he looked ghastly pale
 He crouched on the sleigh and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee
 And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee

 There wasnt a breath in that land of death and I hurried horrordriven
 With a corpse half hid that I couldnt get rid because of a promise given
 It was lashed to the sleigh and it seemed to say
 You may tax your brawn and brains
 But you promised true and its up to you to cremate those last remains

 Now a promise made is a debt unpaid and the trail has its own stern code
 In the days to come though my lips were dumb
 in my heart how I cursed that load
 In the long long night by the lone firelight
 while the huskies round in a ring
 Howled out their woes to the homeless snows 
 O God how I loathed the thing

 And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow
 And on I went though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low
 The trail was bad and I felt half mad but I swore I would not give in
 And Id often sing to the hateful thing and it hearkened with a grin

 Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge and a derelict there lay
 It was jammed in the ice but I saw in a trice it was called the Alice May
 And I looked at it and I thought a bit and I looked at my frozen chum
 Then Here said I with a sudden cry is my crematoreum

 Some planks I tore from the cabin floor and I lit the boiler fire
 Some coal I found that was lying around and I heaped the fuel higher
 The flames just soared and the furnace roared 
 such a blaze you seldom see
 And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal and I stuffed in Sam McGee

 Then I made a hike for I didnt like to hear him sizzle so
 And the heavens scowled and the huskies howled and the wind began to blow
 It was icy cold but the hot sweat rolled
 down my cheeks and I dont know why
 And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky

 I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear
 But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near
 I was sick with dread but I bravely said Ill just take a peep inside
 I guess hes cooked and its time I looked
 then the door I opened wide

 And there sat Sam looking cool and calm in the heart of the furnace roar
 And he wore a smile you could see a mile
 and he said Please close that door
 Its fine in here but I greatly fear youll let in the cold and storm 
 Since I left Plumtree down in Tennessee
 its the first time Ive been warm

 _There are strange things done in the midnight sun
 By the men who moil for gold
 The Arctic trails have their secret tales
 That would make your blood run cold
 The Northern Lights have seen queer sights
 But the queerest they ever did see
 Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
 I cremated Sam McGee_




My Madonna



 I haled me a woman from the street
 Shameless but oh so fair
 I bade her sit in the models seat
 And I painted her sitting there

 I hid all trace of her heart unclean
 I painted a babe at her breast
 I painted her as she might have been
 If the Worst had been the Best

 She laughed at my picture and went away
 Then came with a knowing nod
 A connoisseur and I heard him say
 Tis Mary the Mother of God

 So I painted a halo round her hair
 And I sold her and took my fee
 And she hangs in the church of Saint Hillaire
 Where you and all may see




Unforgotten



 I know a garden where the lilies gleam
 And one who lingers in the sunshine there
 She is than whitestoled lily far more fair
 And oh her eyes are heavenlit with dream

 I know a garret cold and dark and drear
 And one who toils and toils with tireless pen
 Until his brave sad eyes grow weary  then
 He seeks the stars pale silent as a seer

 And ah its strange for desolate and dim
 Between these two there rolls an ocean wide
 Yet he is in the garden by her side
 And she is in the garret there with him




The Reckoning



 Its fine to have a blowout in a fancy restaurant
 With terrapin and canvasback and all the wine you want
 To enjoy the flowers and music watch the pretty women pass
 Smoke a choice cigar and sip the wealthy water in your glass
 Its bully in a hightoned joint to eat and drink your fill
 But its quite another matter when you
 Pay the bill

 Its great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent
 To wear your glad rags always and to never save a cent
 To drift along regardless have a good time every trip
 To hit the high spots sometimes and to let your chances slip
 To know youre acting foolish yet to go on fooling still
 Till Nature calls a showdown and you
 Pay the bill

 Time has got a little bill  get wise while yet you may
 For the debit sides increasing in a most alarming way
 The things you had no right to do the things you should have done
 Theyre all put down its up to you to pay for every one
 So eat drink and be merry have a good time if you will
 But God help you when the time comes and you
 Foot the bill




Quatrains



 One said Thy life is thine to make or mar
 To flicker feebly or to soar a star
 It lies with thee  the choice is thine is thine
 To hit the ties or drive thy autocar

 I answered Her The choice is mine  ah no
 We all were made or marred long long ago
 The parts are written hear the super wail
 Who is stagemanaging this cosmic show

 Blind fools of fate and slaves of circumstance
 Life is a fiddler and we all must dance
 From gloom where mocks that willowisp Freewill
 I heard a voice cry Say give us a chance

 Chance Oh there is no chance The scene is set
 Up with the curtain Man the marionette
 Resumes his part The gods will work the wires
 Theyve got it all down fine you bet you bet

 Its all decreed  the mighty earthquake crash
 The countless constellations wheel and flash
 The rise and fall of empires wars red tide
 The composition of your dinner hash

 Theres no haphazard in this world of ours
 Cause and effect are grim relentless powers
 They rule the world A king was shot last night
 Last night I held the joker and both bowers

 From out the mesh of fate our heads we thrust
 We cant do what we would but what we must
 Heredity has got us in a cinch 
 Consoling thought when youve been on a bust

 Hark to the song where spheral voices blend
 Theres no beginning never will be end
 It makes us nutty hang the astral chimes
 The tables spread come let us dine my friend




The Men That Dont Fit In



 Theres a race of men that dont fit in
 A race that cant stay still
 So they break the hearts of kith and kin
 And they roam the world at will
 They range the field and they rove the flood
 And they climb the mountains crest
 Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood
 And they dont know how to rest

 If they just went straight they might go far
 They are strong and brave and true
 But theyre always tired of the things that are
 And they want the strange and new
 They say Could I find my proper groove
 What a deep mark I would make
 So they chop and change and each fresh move
 Is only a fresh mistake

 And each forgets as he strips and runs
 With a brilliant fitful pace
 Its the steady quiet plodding ones
 Who win in the lifelong race
 And each forgets that his youth has fled
 Forgets that his prime is past
 Till he stands one day with a hope thats dead
 In the glare of the truth at last

 He has failed he has failed he has missed his chance
 He has just done things by half
 Lifes been a jolly good joke on him
 And now is the time to laugh
 Ha ha He is one of the Legion Lost
 He was never meant to win
 Hes a rolling stone and its bred in the bone
 Hes a man who wont fit in




Music in the Bush



 Oer the dark pines she sees the silver moon
 And in the west all tremulous a star
 And soothing sweet she hears the mellow tune
 Of cowbells jangled in the fields afar

 Quite listless for her daily stent is done
 She stands sad exile at her rosewreathed door
 And sends her love eternal with the sun
 That goes to gild the land shell see no more

 The grave gaunt pines imprison her sad gaze
 All still the sky and darkling drearily
 She feels the chilly breath of dear dead days
 Come sifting through the alders eerily

 Oh how the roses riot in their bloom
 The curtains stir as with an ancient pain
 Her old piano gleams from out the gloom
 And waits and waits her tender touch in vain

 But now her hands like moonlight brush the keys
 With velvet grace  melodious delight
 And now a sad refrain from over seas
 Goes sobbing on the bosom of the night

 And now she sings O singer in the gloom
 Voicing a sorrow we can neer express
 Here in the Farness where we few have room
 Unshamed to show our love and tenderness

 Our hearts will echo till they beat no more
 That song of sadness and of motherland
 And stretched in deathless love to Englands shore
 Some day shell hearken and shell understand

 A primadonna in the shining past
 But now a mother growing old and gray
 She thinks of how she held a people fast
 In thrall and gleaned the triumphs of a day

 She sees a sea of faces like a dream
 She sees herself a queen of song once more
 She sees lips part in rapture eyes agleam
 She sings as never once she sang before

 She sings a wild sweet song that throbs with pain
 The added pain of life that transcends art 
 A song of home a deep celestial strain
 The glorious swansong of a dying heart

 A lame tramp comes along the railway track
 A grizzled dog whose day is nearly done
 He passes pauses then comes slowly back
 And listens there  an audience of one

 She sings  her golden voice is passionfraught
 As when she charmed a thousand eager ears
 He listens trembling and she knows it not
 And down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears

 She ceases and is still as if to pray
 There is no sound the stars are all alight 
 Only a wretch who stumbles on his way
 Only a vagrant sobbing in the night




The Rhyme of the Remittance Man



 Theres a fourpronged buck aswinging in the shadow of my cabin
 And it roamed the velvet valley till today
 But I tracked it by the river and I trailed it in the cover
 And I killed it on the mountain miles away
 Now Ive had my lazy supper and the level sun is gleaming
 On the water where the silver salmon play
 And I light my little corncob and I linger softly dreaming
 In the twilight of a land thats far away

 Far away so faint and far is flaming London fevered Paris
 That I fancy I have gained another star
 Far away the din and hurry far away the sin and worry
 Far away  God knows they cannot be too far
 Gilded galleyslaves of Mammon  how my purseproud brothers taunt me
 I might have been as welltodo as they
 Had I clutched like them my chances
 learned their wisdom crushed my fancies
 Starved my soul and gone to business every day

 Well the cherry bends with blossom and the vivid grass is springing
 And the starlike lily nestles in the green
 And the frogs their joys are singing and my heart in tune is ringing
 And it doesnt matter what I might have been
 While above the scented pinegloom piling heights of golden glory
 The sungod paints his canvas in the west
 I can couch me deep in clover I can listen to the story
 Of the lazy lapping water  it is best

 While the trout leaps in the river and the blue grouse thrills the cover
 And the frozen snow betrays the panthers track
 And the robin greets the dayspring with the rapture of a lover
 I am happy and Ill nevermore go back
 For I know Id just be longing for the little old log cabin
 With the morningglory clinging to the door
 Till I loathed the city places cursed the care on all the faces
 Turned my back on lazar London evermore

 So send me far from Lombard Street and write me down a failure
 Put a little in my purse and leave me free
 Say He turned from Fortunes offering to follow up a pale lure
 He is one of us no longer  let him be
 I am one of you no longer by the trails my feet have broken
 The dizzy peaks Ive scaled the campfires glow
 By the lonely seas Ive sailed in  yea the final word is spoken
 I am signed and sealed to nature Be it so




The LowDown White



 This is the payday up at the mines when the bearded brutes come down
 Theres money to burn in the streets tonight
 so Ive sent my klooch to town
 With a haggard face and a ribband of red entwined in her hair of brown

 And I know at the dawn shell come reeling home
 with the bottles one two three 
 One for herself to drown her shame and two big bottles for me
 To make me forget the thing I am and the man I used to be

 To make me forget the brand of the dog as I crouch in this hideous place
 To make me forget once I kindled the light of love in a ladys face
 Where even the squalid Siwash now holds me a black disgrace

 Oh I have guarded my secret well And who would dream as I speak
 In a tribal tongue like a rogue unhung mid the ranchhouse filth and reek
 I could roll to bed with a Latin phrase and rise with a verse of Greek

 Yet I was a senior prizeman once and the pride of a college eight
 Called to the bar  my friends were true
 but they could not keep me straight
 Then came the divorce and I went abroad and died on the River Plate

 But Im not dead yet though with half a lung there isnt time to spare
 And I hope that the year will see me out and thank God no one will care 
 Save maybe the little slim Siwash girl with the rose of shame in her hair

 She will come with the dawn and the dawn is near I can see its evil glow
 Like a corpselight seen through a frosty pane in a night of want and woe
 And yonder she comes by the bleak bullpines
 swift staggering through the snow




The Little Old Log Cabin



 When a man gits on his uppers in a hardpan sort of town
 An he aint got nothin comin an he cant afford ter eat
 An hes in a fix for lodgin an he wanders up an down
 An youd fancy hed been boozin hes so locoed bout the feet
 When hes feelin sneakin sorry an his belt is hangin slack
 An his face is peaked an graylike an his heart gits down an whines
 Then hes apt ter git athinkin an awishin he was back
 In the little ol log cabin in the shadder of the pines

 When hes on the blazin desert an his canteens sprung a leak
 An hes all alone an crazy an hes crawlin like a snail
 An his tongues so black an swollen that it hurts him fer to speak
 An he gouges down fer water an the ravens on his trail
 When hes done with care and cursin an he feels more like to cry
 An he sees ol Death agrinnin an he thinks upon his crimes
 Then hes like ter hev a vision as he settles down ter die
 Of the little ol log cabin an the roses an the vines

 Oh the little ol log cabin its a solemn shinin mark
 When a feller gits ter sinnin an agoin ter the wall
 An folks dont understand him an hes gropin in the dark
 An hes sick of bein cursed at an hes longin fer his call
 When the sun of lifes asinkin you can see it way above
 On the hill from out the shadder in a glory gin the sky
 An your mothers voice is callin an her arms are stretched in love
 An somehow youre glad youre goin an you aint ascared to die
 When youll be like a kid again an nestle to her breast
 An never leave its shelter an forget an love an rest




The Younger Son



 If you leave the gloom of London and you seek a glowing land
 Where all except the flag is strange and new
 Theres a bronzed and stalwart fellow who will grip you by the hand
 And greet you with a welcome warm and true
 For hes your younger brother the one you sent away
 Because there wasnt room for him at home
 And now hes quite contented and hes glad he didnt stay
 And hes building Britains greatness oer the foam

 When the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun
 And the prairie is lit with rose and gold
 And the camp is all abustle and the busy days begun
 He leaps into the saddle sure and bold
 Through the round of heat and hurry through the racket and the rout
 He rattles at a pace that nothing mars
 And when the nightwinds whisper and campfires flicker out
 He is sleeping like a child beneath the stars

 When the wattleblooms are drooping in the sombre sheoak glade
 And the breathless land is lying in a swoon
 He leaves his work a moment leaning lightly on his spade
 And he hears the bellbird chime the Austral noon
 The parrakeets are silent in the gumtree by the creek
 The ferny grove is sunshinesteeped and still
 But the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek
 His little lonely cabin on the hill

 Around the purple vineclad slope the argent river dreams
 The roses almost hide the house from view
 A snowpeak of the Winterberg in crimson splendor gleams
 The shadow deepens down on the karroo
 He seeks the lilyscented dusk beneath the orange tree
 His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows
 And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee
 And one is like the lily one the rose

 He sees his white sheep dapple oer the green New Zealand plain
 And where Vancouvers shaggy ramparts frown
 When the sunlight threads the pinegloom he is fighting might and main
 To clinch the rivets of an Empire down
 You will find him toiling toiling in the south or in the west
 A child of nature fearless frank and free
 And the warmest heart that beats for you is beating in his breast
 And he sends you loyal greeting oer the sea

 Youve a brother in the army youve another in the Church
 One of you is a diplomatic swell
 Youve had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch
 And yet I think hes doing very well
 Im sure his life is happy and he doesnt envy yours
 I know he loves the land his pluck has won
 And I fancy in the years unborn while Englands fame endures
 She will come to bless with pride  The Younger Son




The March of the Dead



 The cruel war was over  oh the triumph was so sweet
 We watched the troops returning through our tears
 There was triumph triumph triumph down the scarlet glittering street
 And you scarce could hear the music for the cheers
 And you scarce could see the housetops for the flags that flew between
 The bells were pealing madly to the sky
 And everyone was shouting for the Soldiers of the Queen
 And the glory of an age was passing by

 And then there came a shadow swift and sudden dark and drear
 The bells were silent not an echo stirred
 The flags were drooping sullenly the men forgot to cheer
 We waited and we never spoke a word
 The sky grew darker darker till from out the gloomy rack
 There came a voice that checked the heart with dread
 Tear down tear down your bunting now and hang up sable black
 They are coming  its the Army of the Dead

 They were coming they were coming gaunt and ghastly sad and slow
 They were coming all the crimson wrecks of pride
 With faces seared and cheeks red smeared and haunting eyes of woe
 And clotted holes the khaki couldnt hide
 Oh the clammy brow of anguish the livid foamflecked lips
 The reeling ranks of ruin swept along
 The limb that trailed the hand that failed the bloody finger tips
 And oh the dreary rhythm of their song

 They left us on the veldtside but we felt we couldnt stop
 On this our Englands crowning festal day
 Were the men of Magersfontein were the men of Spion Kop
 Colenso  were the men who had to pay
 Were the men who paid the bloodprice Shall the grave be all our gain
 You owe us Long and heavy is the score
 Then cheer us for our glory now and cheer us for our pain
 And cheer us as ye never cheered before

 The folks were white and stricken and each tongue seemed weighted with lead
 Each heart was clutched in hollow hand of ice
 And every eye was staring at the horror of the dead
 The pity of the men who paid the price
 They were come were come to mock us in the first flush of our peace
 Through writhing lips their teeth were all agleam
 They were coming in their thousands  oh would they never cease
 I closed my eyes and then  it was a dream

 There was triumph triumph triumph down the scarlet gleaming street
 The town was mad a man was like a boy
 A thousand flags were flaming where the sky and city meet
 A thousand bells were thundering the joy
 There was music mirth and sunshine but some eyes shone with regret
 And while we stun with cheers our homing braves
 O God in Thy great mercy let us nevermore forget
 The graves they left behind the bitter graves




Fighting Mac

 A Life Tragedy



 A pistol shot rings round and round the world
 In pitiful defeat a warrior lies
 A last defiance to dark Death is hurled
 A last wild challenge shocks the sunlit skies
 Alone he falls with wide wan woeful eyes
 Eyes that could smile at death  could not face shame

 Alone alone he paced his narrow room
 In the bright sunshine of that Paris day
 Saw in his thought the awful hand of doom
 Saw in his dream his glory pass away
 Tried in his heart his weary heart to pray
 O God who made me give me strength to face
 The spectre of this bitter black disgrace

     

 The burn brawls darkly down the shaggy glen
 The beekissed heather blooms around the door
 He sees himself a barefoot boy again
 Bending oer page of legendary lore
 He hears the pibroch grips the red claymore
 Runs with the Fiery Cross a clansman true
 Sworn kinsman of Rob Roy and Roderick Dhu

 Eating his heart out with a wild desire
 One day behind his counter trim and neat
 He hears a sound that sets his brain afire 
 The Highlanders are marching down the street
 Oh how the pipes shrill out the mad drums beat
 On to the gates of Hell my Gordons gay
 He flings his hated yardstick away

 He sees the sullen pass highcrowned with snow
 Where Afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate
 He hurls himself against the hidden foe
 They try to rally  ah too late too late
 Again defenseless with fierce eyes that wait
 For death he stands like baited bull at bay
 And flouts the Boers that mad Majuba day

 He sees again the murderous Soudan
 Bloodslaked and rapineswept He seems to stand
 Upon the gory plain of Omdurman
 Then Magersfontein and supreme command
 Over his Highlanders To shake his hand
 A King is proud and princes call him friend
 And glory crowns his life  and now the end

 The awful end His eyes are dark with doom
 He hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead
 He sees the ravaged ranks the flamestabbed gloom
 Oh to have fallen  the battlefield his bed
 With Wauchope and his glorious brotherdead
 Why was he saved for this for this And now
 He raises the revolver to his brow

     

 In many a Highland home framed with rude art
 Youll find his portrait roughhewn stern and square
 Its graven in the Fuyam fellahs heart
 The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer
 The raw lands know it where the fierce suns glare
 The Dervish fears it Honor to his name
 Who holds aloft the shield of Englands fame

 Mourn for our hero men of Northern race
 We do not know his sin we only know
 His sword was keen He laughed death in the face
 And struck for Empires sake a giant blow
 His arm was strong Ah well they learnt the foe
 The echo of his deeds is ringing yet 
 Will ring for aye All else let us forget




The Woman and the Angel



 An angel was tired of heaven as he lounged in the golden street
 His halo was tilted sideways and his harp lay mute at his feet
 So the Master stooped in His pity and gave him a pass to go
 For the space of a moon to the earthworld to mix with the men below

 He doffed his celestial garments scarce waiting to lay them straight
 He bade good by to Peter who stood by the golden gate
 The sexless singers of heaven chanted a fond farewell
 And the imps looked up as they pattered on the redhot flags of hell

 Never was seen such an angel  eyes of heavenly blue
 Features that shamed Apollo hair of a golden hue
 The women simply adored him his lips were like Cupids bow
 But he never ventured to use them  and so they voted him slow

 Till at last there came One Woman a marvel of loveliness
 And she whispered to him Do you love me
 And he answered that woman Yes
 And she said Put your arms around me and kiss me and hold me  so 
 But fiercely he drew back saying This thing is wrong and I know

 Then sweetly she mocked his scruples and softly she him beguiled
 You who are verily man among men speak with the tongue of a child
 We have outlived the old standards we have burst like an overtight thong
 The ancient outworn Puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong

 Then the Master feared for His angel and called him again to His side
 For oh the woman was wondrous and oh the angel was tried
 And deep in his hell sang the Devil and this was the strain of his song
 The ancient outworn Puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong




The Rhyme of the Restless Ones



 We couldnt sit and study for the law
 The stagnation of a bank we couldnt stand
 For our riot blood was surging and we didnt need much urging
 To excitements and excesses that are banned
 So we took to wine and drink and other things
 And the devil in us struggled to be free
 Till our friends rose up in wrath and they pointed out the path
 And they paid our debts and packed us oer the sea

 Oh they shook us off and shipped us oer the foam
 To the larger lands that lure a man to roam
 And we took the chance they gave
 Of a far and foreign grave
 And we bade goodby for evermore to home

 And some of us are climbing on the peak
 And some of us are camping on the plain
 By pine and palm youll find us with never claim to bind us
 By track and trail youll meet us once again

 We are the fated serfs to freedom  sky and sea
 We have failed where slummy cities overflow
 But the stranger ways of earth know our pride and know our worth
 And we go into the dark as fighters go

 Yes we go into the night as brave men go
 Though our faces they be often streaked with woe
 Yet were hard as cats to kill
 And our hearts are reckless still
 And weve danced with death a dozen times or so

 And youll find us in Alaska after gold
 And youll find us herding cattle in the South
 We like strong drink and fun and when the race is run
 We often die with curses in our mouth
 We are wild as colts unbroke but never mean
 Of our sins weve shoulders broad to bear the blame
 But well never stay in town and well never settle down
 And well never have an object or an aim

 No theres that in us that time can never tame
 And life will always seem a careless game
 And theyd better far forget 
 Those who say they love us yet 
 Forget blot out with bitterness our name




New Years Eve



 Its cruel cold on the waterfront silent and dark and drear
 Only the black tide weltering only the hissing snow
 And I alone like a stormtossed wreck on this night of the glad New Year
 Shuffling along in the icy wind ghastly and gaunt and slow

 Theyre playing a tune in McGuffys saloon
 and its cheery and bright in there
 God but Im weak  since the bitter dawn and never a bite of food
 Ill just go over and slip inside  I mustnt give way to despair 
 Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good

 Theyll jeer at me and theyll sneer at me
 and theyll call me a whiskey soak
 Have a drink Well thankee kindly sir I dont mind if I do
 A drivelling dirty ginjoint fiend the butt of the barroom joke
 Sunk and sodden and hopeless  Another Well heres to you

 McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit
 The barman is talking of Tammany Hall and why the ward boss got fired
 Ill just sneak into a corner and theyll let me alone a bit
 The room is reeling round and round
 O God but Im tired Im tired

     

 Roses she wore on her breast that night Oh but their scent was sweet
 Alone we sat on the balcony and the fanpalms arched above
 The witching strain of a waltz by Strauss came up to our cool retreat
 And I prisoned her little hand in mine and I whispered my plea of love

 Then sudden the laughter died on her lips and lowly she bent her head
 And oh there came in the deep dark eyes a look that was heaven to see
 And the moments went and I waited there and never a word was said
 And she plucked from her bosom a rose of red and shyly gave it to me

 Then the music swelled to a crash of joy and the lights blazed up like day
 And I held her fast to my throbbing heart and I kissed her bonny brow
 She is mine she is mine for evermore the violins seemed to say
 And the bells were ringing the New Year in  O God I can hear them now

 Dont you remember that long last waltz with its sobbing sad refrain
 Dont you remember that last goodby and the dear eyes dim with tears
 Dont you remember that golden dream with never a hint of pain
 Of lives that would blend like an angelsong
 in the bliss of the coming years

 Oh what have I lost What have I lost Ethel forgive forgive
 The red red rose is faded now and its fifty years ago
 Twere better to die a thousand deaths than live each day as I live
 I have sinned I have sunk to the lowest depths 
 but oh I have suffered so

 Hark Oh hark I can hear the bells Look I can see her there
 Fair as a dream but it fades And now 
 I can hear the dreadful hum
 Of the crowded court See the Judge looks down
 _NOT GUILTY_ my Lord I swear
 The bells  I can hear the bells again Ethel I come I come

     

 Rouse up old man its twelve oclock You cant sleep here you know
 Say aint you got no sentiment Lift up your muddled head
 Have a drink to the glad New Year a drop before you go 
 You darned old dirty hobo My God Here boys Hes _DEAD_




Comfort



 Say Youve struck a heap of trouble 
 Bust in business lost your wife
 No one cares a cent about you
 You dont care a cent for life
 Hard luck has of hope bereft you
 Health is failing wish youd die 
 Why youve still the sunshine left you
 And the big blue sky

 Sky so blue it makes you wonder
 If its heaven shining through
 Earth so smiling way out yonder
 Sun so bright it dazzles you
 Birds asinging flowers aflinging
 All their fragrance on the breeze
 Dancing shadows green still meadows 
 Dont you mope youve still got these

 These and none can take them from you
 These and none can weigh their worth
 What youre tired and broke and beaten 
 Why youre rich  youve got the earth
 Yes if youre a tramp in tatters
 While the blue sky bends above
 Youve got nearly all that matters 
 Youve got God and God is love




The Harpy



 There was a woman and she was wise woefully wise was she
 She was old so old yet her years all told were but a score and three
 And she knew by heart from finish to start the Book of Iniquity

 There is no hope for such as I on earth nor yet in Heaven
 Unloved I live unloved I die unpitied unforgiven
 A loathed jade I ply my trade unhallowed and unshriven

 I paint my cheeks for they are white and cheeks of chalk men hate
 Mine eyes with wine I make them shine that man may seek and sate
 With overhead a lamp of red I sit me down and wait

 Until they come the nightly scum with drunken eyes aflame
 Your sweethearts sons ye scornful ones  tis I who know their shame
 The gods ye see are brutes to me  and so I play my game

 For life is not the thing we thought and not the thing we plan
 And Woman in a bitter world must do the best she can 
 Must yield the stroke and bear the yoke and serve the will of man

 Must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire
 Though be she loved for love alone or be she loved for hire
 For every man since life began is tainted with the mire

 And though you know he love you so and set you on loves throne
 Yet let your eyes but mock his sighs and let your heart be stone
 Lest you be left as I was left attainted and alone

 From loves close kiss to hells abyss is one sheer flight I trow
 And wedding ring and bridal bell are willowisps of woe
 And tis not wise to love too well and this all women know

 Wherefore the wolfpack having gorged upon the lamb their prey
 With siren smile and serpent guile I make the wolfpack pay 
 With velvet paws and flensing claws a tigress roused to slay

 One who in youth sought truest truth and found a devils lies
 A symbol of the sin of man a human sacrifice
 Yet shall I blame on man the shame Could it be otherwise

 Was I not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride
 The Maker marred and evilstarred I drift upon His tide
 And He alone shall judge His own so I His judgment bide

 Fate has written a tragedy its name is The Human Heart
 The Theatre is the House of Life Woman the mummers part
 The Devil enters the prompters box and the play is ready to start




Premonition



 Twas a year ago and the moon was bright
 Oh I remember so well so well
 I walked with my love in a sea of light
 And the voice of my sweet was a silver bell
 And sudden the moon grew strangely dull
 And sudden my love had taken wing
 I looked on the face of a grinning skull
 I strained to my heart a ghastly thing

 Twas but fantasy for my love lay still
 In my arms with her tender eyes aglow
 And she wondered why my lips were chill
 Why I was silent and kissed her so
 A year has gone and the moon is bright
 A gibbous moon like a ghost of woe
 I sit by a newmade grave tonight
 And my heart is broken  its strange you know




The Tramps



 Can you recall dear comrade when we tramped Gods land together
 And we sang the old old Earthsong for our youth was very sweet
 When we drank and fought and lusted as we mocked at tie and tether
 Along the road to Anywhere the wide world at our feet 

 Along the road to Anywhere when each day had its story
 When time was yet our vassal and lifes jest was still unstale
 When peace unfathomed filled our hearts as bathed in amber glory
 Along the road to Anywhere we watched the sunsets pale

 Alas the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with disaster
 Theres hunger want and weariness yet O we loved it so
 As on we tramped exultantly and no man was our master
 And no man guessed what dreams were ours as swinging heel and toe
 We tramped the road to Anywhere the magic road to Anywhere
 The tragic road to Anywhere such dear dim years ago




LEnvoi



 You who have lived in the land
 You who have trusted the trail
 You who are strong to withstand
 You who are swift to assail
 _Songs have I sung to beguile
 Vintage of desperate years
 Hard as a harlots smile
 Bitter as unshed tears_

 Little of joy or mirth
 Little of ease I sing
 Sagas of men of earth
 Humanly suffering
 _Such as you all have done
 Savagely faring forth
 Sons of the midnight sun
 Argonauts of the North_

 Far in the land God forgot
 Glimmers the lure of your trail
 Still in your lust are you taught
 Even to win is to fail
 _Still you must follow and fight
 Under the vampire wing
 There in the long long night
 Hoping and vanquishing_

 Husbandman of the Wild
 Reaping a barren gain
 Scourged by desire reconciled
 Unto disaster and pain
 _These my songs are for you
 You who are seared with the brand
 God knows I have tried to be true
 Please God you will understand_
