_Preface_


In this age of the arduous pursuit of peace prosperity and
pleasure the smallest contribution to the gaiety if not to the
wisdom of nations can scarcely be unwelcome With this in mind the
author has prepared The Foolish Dictionary not in serious
emulation of the worthierand wordierworks of Webster and
Worcester but rather in the playful spirit of the parodist who
would gladly direct the faint rays from his flickering candle of
fun to the shrine of their great memories

With half a million English words to choose from modesty has been
the watchword and the author has confined himself to the treatment
of only about half a thousand How wise flippant sober or stupid
this treatment has been it is for the reader alone to judge
However if from epigram derivative or pure absurdity there be
born a single laugh between the lids the laborer will accredit
himself worthy of his hire

In further explanation it should be said that some slight deference
has been made to other wits and the definitions include a few
quotations from the great minds of the past and present As for the
rest the jury will please acknowledge a plea of guilty from

_Postage and Postal Information_

_How to Mail a Letter_


After writing it place it in a square or oblong enveloperound
ones are no longer fashionableseal it on the back and write a
legible address on the front then take a twocent stamp give it a
good licking and retire it to the cornerthe upper righthand
corner on the outsidenever inside as the postmaster is not a
clairvoyant Drop it in a letterbox and trust to luck If its a
love letter it will probably reach her all right for Cupid is a
faithful postman and carries a stout pair of wings If its a bill
by all means have it registered otherwise your debtor will swear
he never got it If its cash for your tailor heed the postoffice
warning Dont send money through the mails Wait until you happen
to meet him on the street If he sees you first you lose


Firstclass Matter

Anything you are ashamed to have the postmaster or postmistress
read and therefore seal up is known as firstclass matter Also
postal cards where youre only allowed to argue on one side If you
think your letter should travel slowly invest ten cents in a
Special Delivery Stamp This will insure a nice leisurely journey
lasting from one to two days longer than by the cheap twocent
route


Secondclass Matter

This class was originated for the benefit of Patent Medicine Mixers
who print circulars on What Ails You four times a year and pepper
the land with Beforeandaftertaking caricatures at the rate of
one cent a pound


Thirdclass Matter

While the quack nostrums travel secondclass for one cent a pound
books engravings manuscript copy and works of art have to go
thirdclass and are taxed one cent for every two ounces They must
also be left open for inspection thus affording the postoffice
employee a fleeting acquaintance with something really useful


Fourthclass Matter

Everything not included in the above except poisons explosives
live animals insects inflammable articles and things giving off a
bad odor The last two do not include _The Police Gazette_ or _The
Philistine_
