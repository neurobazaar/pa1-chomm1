THE NATURE FAKER

By Richard Harding Davis



Richard Herrick was a young man with a gentle disposition much
money and no sense of humor His object in life was to marry Miss
Catherweight For three years she had tried to persuade him this could
not be and finally in order to convince him married some one else
When the woman he loves marries another man the rejected one is
popularly supposed to take to drink or to foreign travel Statistics
show that instead he instantly falls in love with the best friend of
the girl who refused him But as Herrick truly loved Miss Catherweight
he could not worship any other woman and so he became a lover of
nature Nature he assured his men friends does not disappoint you The
more thought care affection you give to nature the more she gives
you in return and while so he admitted in wooing nature there are
no great moments there are no heartaches Jackson one of the men
friends and of a frivolous disposition said that he also could admire
a landscape but he would rather look at the beautiful eyes of a girl
he knew than at the Lakes of Killarney with a full moon a setting sun
and the aurora borealis for a background Herrick suggested that
while the beautiful eyes might seek those of another man the Lakes of
Killarney would always remain where you could find them Herrick pursued
his new love in Connecticut on an abandoned farm which he converted into
a model one On it he established model dairies and model incubators
He laid out oldfashioned gardens sunken gardens Italian gardens
landscape gardens and a game preserve

The game preserve was his own especial care and pleasure It consisted
of two hundred acres of dense forest and hills and ridges of rock It
was filled with mysterious caves deep chasms tiny gurgling streams
nestling springs and wild laurel It was barricaded with fallen
treetrunks and mosscovered rocks that had never felt the foot of man
since that foot had worn a moccasin Around the preserve was a high
fence stout enough to keep poachers on the outside and to persuade
the wild animals that inhabited it to linger on the inside These wild
animals were squirrels rabbits and raccoons Every day in sunshine
or in rain entering through a private gate Herrick would explore this
holy of holies For such vermin as would destroy the gentler animals
he carried a gun But it was turned only on those that preyed upon his
favorites For hours he would climb through this wilderness or seated
on a rock watch a bluebird building her nest or a squirrel laying in
rations against the coming of the snow In time he grew to think he knew
and understood the inhabitants of this wild place of which he was the
overlord He looked upon them not as his tenants but as his guests And
when they fled from him in terror to caves and hollow treetrunks he
wished he might call them back and explain he was their friend that it
was due to him they lived in peace He was glad they were happy He was
glad it was through him that undisturbed they could live the simple
life

His fall came through ambition Herrick himself attributed it to his
too great devotion to nature and natures children Jackson he of the
frivolous mind attributed it to the fact that any man is sure to come
to grief who turns from the worship of Gods noblest handiwork by which
Jackson meant woman to worship chipmunks and Plymouth Rock hens One
night Jackson lured Herrick into New York to a dinner and a music hall
He invited also one Kelly a mutual friend of a cynical and combative
disposition Jackson liked to hear him and Herrick abuse each other and
always introduced subjects he knew would cause each to lose his temper

But on this night Herrick needed no goading He was in an ungrateful
mood Accustomed to food fresh from the soil and the farmyard he
sneered at hothouse asparagus hothouse grapes and coldstorage quail
At the music hall he was even more difficult In front of him sat a
stout lady who when she shook with laughter shed patchouli and a man who
smoked American cigarettes At these and the steam heat the nostrils of
Herrick trained to the odor of balsam and the smoke of open wood fires
took offense He refused to be amused The monologue artist in whom
Jackson found delight caused Herrick only to groan the knockabout
comedians he hoped would break their collarbones the lady who danced
Salome and who fascinated Kelly Herrick prayed would catch pneumonia
and die of it And when the drop rose upon the Countess Zichys bears
his dissatisfaction reached a climax

There were three bearsa large papa bear a mamma bear and the baby
bear On the programme they were described as Bruno Clara and Ikey
They were of a dusty brown with long curling noses tipped with white
and fat tancolored bellies When father Bruno on his hind legs and
bare feet waddled down the stage he resembled a Hebrew gentleman in a
brown bathing suit who had lost his waistline As he tripped doubtfully
forward with mincing steps he continually and mournfully wagged his
head He seemed to be saying This water is much too cold for me The
mamma bear was dressed in a poke bonnet and white apron and resembled
the wolf who frightened Little Red RidingHood and Ikey the baby bear
wore rakishly over one eye the pointed cap of a clown To those who knew
their vaudeville this was indisputable evidence that Ikey would furnish
the comic relief Nor did Ikey disappoint them He was a wayward son
When his parents were laboriously engaged in a boxingmatch or dancing
to the Merry Widow Waltz or balancing on stepladders Ikey on all
fours would scamper to the footlights and leaning over make a swift
grab at the head of the first trombone And when the Countess Zichy
apprised by the shouts of the audience of Ikeys misconduct waved a toy
whip Ikey would gallop back to his pedestal and howl at her To every
one except Herrick and the first trombone this playfulness on the part
of Ikey furnished great delight

The performances of the bears ended with Bruno and Clara dancing heavily
to the refrain of the Merry Widow Waltz while Ikey pretended to
conduct the music of the orchestra On the final call Madame Zichy
threw to each of the animals a beer bottle filled with milk and the
gusto with which the savagelooking beasts uncorked the bottles and
drank from them greatly amused the audience Ikey standing on his hind
legs his head thrown back with both paws clasping the base of the
bottle shoved the neck far down his throat and then hurling it
from him and cocking his clowns hat over his eyes gave a masterful
imitation of a very intoxicated bear

That exclaimed Herrick hotly is a degrading spectacle It degrades
the bear and degrades me and you

No it bores me said Kelly

If you understood nature retorted Herrick and natures children it
would infuriate you

I dont go to a music hall to get infuriated said Kelly

Trained dogs I dont mind exclaimed Herrick Dogs are not wild
animals The things theyre trained to do are of USE They can guard the
house or herd sheep But a bear is a wild beast Always will be a wild
beast You cant train him to be of use Its degrading to make him ride
a bicycle I hate it If Id known there were to be performing bears
tonight I wouldnt have come

And if Id known you were to be here tonight I wouldnt have come
said Kelly Where do we go to next

They went next to a restaurant in a gayly decorated cellar Into this
young men like themselves and beautiful ladies were so anxious to hurl
themselves that to restrain them a rope was swung across the entrance
and page boys stood on guard When a young man became too anxious to
spend his money the page boys pushed in his shirt front After they
had fought their way to a table Herrick ungraciously remarked he would
prefer to sup in a subway station The people he pointed out would be
more human the decorations were much of the same Turkishbath school of
art and the air was no worse

Cheer up Clarence begged Jackson youll soon be dead Tomorrow
youll be back among your treetoads and sunsets And let us hope he
sighed no one will try to stop you

What worries me is this explained Herrick I cant help thinking
that if one night of this artificial life is so hard upon me what must
it be to those bears

Kelly exclaimed with exasperation Confound the bears he cried If
you must spoil my supper weeping over animals weep over carthorses
They work Those bears are loafers Theyre as well fed as pet canaries
Theyre aristocrats

But its not a free life protested Herrick Its not the life they
love

Its a darned sight better declared Kelly than sleeping in a damp
wood eating raw blackberries

The more you say retorted Herrick the more you show you know
nothing whatsoever of natures children and their habits

And all you know of them returned Kelly is that a cat has nine
lives and a barking dog wont bite Youre a nature faker Herrick
refused to be diverted

It hurt me he said They were so big and goodnatured and
helpless Ill bet that woman beats them I kept thinking of them as
they were in the woods tramping over the clean pine needles eating
nuts andand honey and

Buns suggested Jackson

I cant forget them said Herrick Its going to haunt me tomorrow
when Im back in the woods Ill think of those poor beasts capering
in a hot theatre when they ought to be out in the open as God meant
they

Well then protested Kelly take em to the open And turn em
loose And I hope they bite YOU

At this Herrick frowned so deeply that Kelly feared he had gone too far
Inwardly he reproved himself for not remembering that his friend lacked
a sense of humor But Herrick undeceived him

You are right he exclaimed Tomorrow I will buy those bears take
them to the farm and turn them loose

No objections his friend could offer could divert him from his purpose
When they urged that to spend so much money in such a manner was
criminally wasteful he pointed out that he was sufficiently rich to
indulge any extravagant fancy whether in polo ponies or bears when
they warned him that if he did not look out the bears would catch him
alone in the woods and eat him he retorted that the bears were now
educated to a different diet when they said he should consider the
peace of mind of his neighbors he assured them the fence around his
game preserve would restrain an elephant

Besides protested Kelly what you propose to do is not only
impracticable but its cruelty to animals A domesticated animal cant
return to a state of nature and live

Cant it jeered Herrick Did you ever read The Call of the Wild

Did you ever read retorted Kelly what happened at the siege of
Ladysmith when the oats ran low and they drove the artillery horses out
to grass They starved thats all And if you dont feed your bears on
milk out of a bottle theyll starve too

Thats what will happen cried Jackson those bears have forgotten
what a pine forest smells like Maybe its a pity but its the fact
Ill bet if you could ask them whether theyd rather sleep in a cave
on your farm or be headliners in vaudeville theyd tell you they were
devoted to their art

Why exclaimed Kelly theyre so far from nature that if they didnt
have that colored boy to comb and brush them twice a day theyd be
ashamed to look each other in the eyes

And another thing continued Jackson trained animals love to show
off Theyre children Those bears ENJOY doing those tricks They ENJOY
the applause They enjoy dancing to the Merry Widow Waltz And if you
lock them up in your jungle theyll get so homesick that theyll give a
performance twice a day to the squirrels and woodpeckers

Its just as hard to unlearn a thing as to learn it said Kelly
sententiously You cant make a man who has learned to wear shoes enjoy
going around in his bare feet

Rot cried Herrick Look at me Didnt I love New York I loved it so
I never went to bed for fear Id miss something But when I went Back
to the Land did it take me long to fall in love with the forests and
the green fields It took me a week I go to bed now the same day I get
up and Ive passed on my high hat and frock coat to a scarecrow And
Ill bet you when those bears once scent the wild woods theyll stampede
for them like Croker going to a third alarm

And I repeat cried Kelly you are a nature faker And Ill leave it
to the bears to prove it

We have done our best sighed Jackson We have tried to save him
money and trouble And now all he can do for us in return is to give us
seats for the opening performance

What the bears cost Herrick he never told But it was a very large sum
As the Countess Zichy pointed out bears as bears in a state of nature
are cheap If it were just a bear he wanted he himself could go to
Pike County Pennsylvania and trap one What he was paying for she
explained was the time she had spent in educating the Bruno family and
added to that the time during which she must now remain idle while she
educated another family

Herrick knew for what he was paying It was the pleasure of rescuing
unwilling slaves from bondage As to their expensive education if
they returned to a state of ignorance as rapidly as did most college
graduates he knew he would be satisfied Two days later when her
engagement at the music hall closed Madame Zichy reluctantly turned
over her pets to their new manager With Ikey she was especially loath
to part

Ill never get one like him she wailed Ikey is the funniest
fourlegged clown in America Hes a naturalborn comedian Folks think
I learn him those tricks but its all his own stuff Only last week we
was playing Paolis in Bridgeport and when I was putting Bruno through
the hoops Ikey runs to the stagebox and grabs a pound of caramels out
of a girls lapand swallows the box And in St Paul if the trombone
hadnt worn a wig Ikey would have scalped him Say it was a scream
When the audience see the trombone snatched baldheaded and him trying
to get back his wig and Ikey chewing it they went crazy You cant
learn a bear tricks like that Its just genius Some folks think I
taught him to act like he was intoxicated but he picked that up too
all by himself through watching my husband And Ikeys very fond of
beer on his own account If I dont stop them the stage hands would be
always slipping him drinks I hope you wont give him none

I will not said Herrick

The bears Ikey in one cage and Bruno and Clara in another travelled
by express to the station nearest the Herrick estate There they were
transferred to a farm wagon and grumbling and growling and with
Ikey howling like an unspanked child they were conveyed to the game
preserve At the only gate that entered it Kelly and Jackson and a
specially invited house party of youths and maidens were gathered to
receive them At a greater distance stood all of the servants and farm
hands and as the wagon backed against the gate with the door of Ikeys
cage opening against it the entire audience with one accord moved
solidly to the rear Herrick with a pleased but somewhat nervous smile
mounted the wagon But before he could unlock the cage Kelly demanded to
be heard He insisted that following the custom of all great artists
the bears should give a farewell performance

He begged that Bruno and Clara might be permitted to dance together He
pointed out that this would be the last time they could listen to the
strains of the Merry Widow Waltz He called upon everybody present to
whistle it

The suggestion of an openair performance was received coldly At the
moment no one seemed able to pucker his lips into a whistle and some
even explained that with that famous waltz they were unfamiliar

One girl attained an instant popularity by pointing out that the bears
could waltz just as well on one side of the fence as the other Kelly
cheated of his free performance then begged that before Herrick
condemned the bears to starve on acorns he should give them a farewell
drink and Herrick who was slightly rattled replied excitedly that
he had not ransomed the animals only to degrade them The argument was
interrupted by the French chef falling out of a tree He had climbed it
he explained in order to obtain a better view

When in turn it was explained to him that a bear also could climb
a tree he remembered he had left his oven door open His departure
reminded other servants of duties they had neglected and one of
the guests also on remembering he had put in a longdistance call
hastened to the house Jackson suggested that perhaps they had better
all return with him as the presence of so many people might frighten
the bears At the moment he spoke Ikey emitted a hideous howl whether
of joy or rage no one knew and few remained to find out It was not
until Herrick had investigated and reported that Ikey was still behind
the bars that the house party cautiously returned The house party
then filed a vigorous protest Its members with Jackson as spokesman
complained that Herrick was relying entirely too much on his supposition
that the bears would be anxious to enter the forest Jackson pointed out
that should they not care to do so there was nothing to prevent them
from doubling back under the wagon in which case the house party and
all of the United States lay before them It was not until a lawntennis
net and much chicken wire was stretched in intricate thicknesses
across the lower half of the gate that Herrick was allowed to proceed
Unassisted he slid back the cage door and without a moments
hesitation Ikey leaped from the wagon through the gate and into the
preserve For an instant dazed by the sudden sunlight he remained
motionless and then after sniffing delightedly at the air stuck his
nose deep into the autumn leaves Turning on his back he luxuriously
and joyfully kicked his legs and rolled from side to side

Herrick gave a shout of joy and triumph What did I tell you he
called See how he loves it See how happy he is

Not at all protested Kelly He thought you gave him the sign to
roll over Tell him to play dead and hell do that Tell ALL
the bears to play dead begged Jackson until Im back in the
billiardroom

Flushed with happiness Herrick tossed Ikeys cage out of the wagon
and opened the door of the one that held Bruno and Clara On their part
there was a moment of doubt As though suspecting a trap they moved to
the edge of the cage and gazed critically at the screen of trees and
tangled vines that rose before them

They think its a new backdrop explained Kelly

But the delight with which Ikey was enjoying his bath in the autumn
leaves was not lost upon his parents Slowly and clumsily they dropped
to the ground As though they expected to be recalled each turned to
look at the group of people who had now run to peer through the wire
meshes of the fence But as no one spoke and no one signalled the
three bears in single file started toward the edge of the forest They
had of cleared space to cover only a little distance and at each step
as though fearful they would be stopped and punished one or the other
turned his head But no one halted them With quickening footsteps the
bears now almost at a gallop plunged forward The next instant they
were lost to sight and only the crackling of the underbrush told that
they had come into their own

Herrick dropped to the ground and locked himself inside the preserve

Im going after them he called to see what theyll do

There was a frantic chorus of entreaties

Dont be an ass begged Jackson Theyll eat you Herrick waved his
hand reassuringly

They wont even see me he explained I can find my way about this
place better than they can And Ill keep to windward of them and watch
them Go to the house he commanded Ill be with you in an hour and
report

It was with real relief that on assembling for dinner the house party
found Herrick in high spirits with the usual number of limbs and
awaiting them The experiment had proved a great success He told how
unheeded by the bears he had without difficulty followed in their
tracks For an hour he had watched them No happy schoolchildren let
loose at recess could have embraced their freedom with more obvious
delight They drank from the running streams for honey they explored
the hollow treetrunks they sharpened their claws on mossgrown rocks
and among the fallen oak leaves scratched violently for acorns So
satisfied was Herrick with what he had seen with the success of his
experiment and so genuine and unselfish was he in the thought of the
happiness he had brought to the beasts of the forests that for him no
dinner ever passed more pleasantly Miss Waring who sat next to her
host thought she had seldom met a man with so kind and simple a nature
She rather resented the fact and she was inwardly indignant that so
much right feeling and affection could be wasted on farmyard fowls and
fourfooted animals She felt sure that some nice girl seated at the
other end of the table smiling through the light of the wax candles
upon Herrick would soon make him forget his love of Nature and
Natures children She even saw herself there and this may have made
her exhibit more interest in Herricks experiment than she really felt
In any event Herrick found her most sympathetic and when dinner was
over carried her off to a corner of the terrace It was a warm night in
early October and the great woods of the game preserve that stretched
below them were lit with a full moon

On his way to the lake for a moonlight row with one of the house party
who belonged to that sex that does not row but looks well in the
moonlight Kelly halted and jeered mockingly

How can you sit there he demanded while those poor beasts are
freezing in a cave with not even a silk coverlet or a pillowsham You
and your valet ought to be down there now carrying them pajamas

Kelly declared Herrick unruffled in his moment of triumph I hate
to say I told you so but you force me Go away he commanded You
have neither imagination nor soul

And thats true he assured Miss Waring as Kelly and his companion
left them Now I see nothing in what I accomplished that is
ridiculous Had you watched those bears as I did you would have felt
that sympathy that exists between all who love the outofdoor life A
dog loves to see his master pick up his stick and his hat to take him
for a walk and the man enjoys seeing the dog leaping and quartering
the fields before him They are both the happier At least I am happier
tonight knowing those bears are at peace and at home than I would
be if I thought of them being whipped through their tricks in a dirty
theatre Herrick pointed to the great forest trees of the preserve
their tops showing dimly in the mist of moonlight Somewhere down in
that valley he murmured are three happy animals They are no longer
slaves and puppetsthey are their own masters For the rest of their
lives they can sleep on pine needles and dine on nuts and honey No one
shall molest them no one shall force them through degrading tricks
Hereafter they can choose their life and their own home among the
rocks and the Herricks words were frozen on his tongue From the
other end of the terrace came a scream so fierce so long so full of
human suffering that at the sound the blood of all that heard it turned
to water It was so appalling that for an instant no one moved and then
from every part of the house along the garden walks from the servants
quarters came the sound of pounding feet Herrick with Miss Waring
clutching at his sleeve raced toward the other end of the terrace They
had not far to go Directly in front of them they saw what had dragged
from the very soul of the woman the scream of terror

The drawingroom opened upon the terrace and seated at the piano
Jackson had been playing for those in the room to dance The windows to
the terrace were open The terrace itself was flooded with moonlight
Seeking the fresh air one of the dancers stepped from the drawingroom
to the flags outside She had then raised the cry of terror and fallen
in a faint What she had seen Herrick a moment later also saw On the
terrace in the moonlight Bruno and Clara on their hind legs were
solemnly waltzing Neither the scream nor the cessation of the music
disturbed them Contentedly proudly they continued to revolve in hops
and leaps From their happy expression it was evident they not only
were enjoying themselves but that they felt they were greatly affording
immeasurable delight to others Sick at heart furious bitterly hurt
with roars of mocking laughter in his ears Herrick ran toward the
stables for help At the farther end of the terrace the butler had
placed a tray of liqueurs whiskeys and soda bottles His back had been
turned for only a few moments but the time had sufficed

Lolling with his legs out stretched in a wicker chair Herrick beheld
the form of Ikey Between his uplifted paws he held aloof the base of
a decanter between his teeth and well jammed down his throat was the
long neck of the bottle From it issued the sound of gentle gurgling
Herrick seized the decanter and hurled it crashing upon the terrace
With difficulty Ikey rose Swaying and shaking his head reproachfully
he gave Herrick a perfectly accurate imitation of an intoxicated bear

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
