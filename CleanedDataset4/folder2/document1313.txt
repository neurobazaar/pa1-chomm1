OVER THE SLIPRAILS




The ShantyKeepers Wife



There were about a dozen of us jammed into the coach on the box seat
and hanging on to the roof and tailboard as best we could We were
shearers bagmen agents a squatter a cockatoo the usual jokerand
one or two professional spielers perhaps We were tired and stiff and
nearly frozentoo cold to talk and too irritable to risk the inevitable
argument which an interchange of ideas would have led up to We had been
looking forward for hours it seemed to the pub where we were to change
horses For the last hour or two all that our united efforts had been
able to get out of the driver was a grunt to the effect that it was
bout a couple o miles Then he said or grunted Taint fur now
a couple of times and refused to commit himself any further he seemed
grumpy about having committed himself that far

He was one of those men who take everything in dead earnest who regard
any expression of ideas outside their own sphere of life as trivial or
indeed if addressed directly to them as offensive who in fact are
darkly suspicious of anything in the shape of a joke or laugh on the
part of an outsider in their own particular dusthole He seemed to
be always thinking and thinking a lot when his hands were not both
engaged he would tilt his hat forward and scratch the base of his
skull with his little finger and let his jaw hang But his intellectual
powers were mostly concentrated on a doubtful swingletree a misfitting
collar or that there bay or piebald on the off or near side with the
sore shoulder

Casual letters or papers to be delivered on the road were matters
which troubled him vaguely but constantlylike the abstract ideas of
his passengers

The joker of our party was a humourist of the dry order and had been
slyly taking rises out of the driver for the last two or three stages
But the driver only brooded He wasnt the one to tell you straight if
you offended him or if he fancied you offended him and thus gain your
respect or prevent a misunderstanding which would result in lifelong
enmity He might meet you in after years when you had forgotten all
about your trespassif indeed you had ever been conscious of itand
stoush you unexpectedly on the ear

Also you might regard him as your friend on occasion and yet he would
stand by and hear a perfect stranger tell you the most outrageous lies
to your hurt and know that the stranger was telling lies and never put
you up to it It would never enter his head to do so It wouldnt be any
affair of hisonly an abstract question

It grew darker and colder The rain came as if the frozen south were
spitting at your face and neck and hands and our feet grew as big as
camels and went dead and we might as well have stamped the footboards
with wooden legs for all the feeling we got into ours But they were
more comfortable that way for the toes didnt curl up and pain so much
nor did our corns stick out so hard against the leather and shoot

We looked out eagerly for some clearing or fence or lightsome sign
of the shanty where we were to change horsesbut there was nothing
save blackness all round The long straight cleared road was no longer
relieved by the ghostly patch of light far ahead where the bordering
treewalls came together in perspective and framed the ether We were
down in the bed of the bush

We pictured a haven of rest with a suspended lamp burning in the frosty
air outside and a big log fire in a cosy parlour off the bar and a
long table set for supper But this is a land of contradictions wayside
shanties turn up unexpectedly and in the most unreasonable places and
are as likely as not prepared for a banquet when you are not hungry
and cant wait and as cold and dark as a bushmans grave when you are
and can

Suddenly the driver said Were there now He said this as if he had
driven us to the scaffold to be hanged and was fiercely glad that hed
got us there safely at last We looked but saw nothing then a light
appeared ahead and seemed to come towards us and presently we saw that
it was a lantern held up by a man in a slouch hat with a dark bushy
beard and a threebushel bag around his shoulders He held up his other
hand and said something to the driver in a tone that might have been
used by the leader of a search party who had just found the body The
driver stopped and then went on slowly

Whats up we asked Whats the trouble

Oh its all right said the driver

The publicans wife is sick somebody said and he wants us to come
quietly

The usual little slab and bark shanty was suggested in the gloom with a
big bark stable looming in the background We climbed down like so many
cripples As soon as we began to feel our legs and be sure we had the
right ones and the proper allowance of feet we helped as quietly as
possible to take the horses out and round to the stable

Is she very bad we asked the publican showing as much concern as we
could

Yes he said in a subdued voice of a rough man who had spent several
anxious sleepless nights by the sick bed of a dear one But God
willing I think well pull her through

Thus encouraged we said sympathetically Were very sorry to trouble
you but I suppose we could manage to get a drink and a bit to eat

Well he said theres nothing to eat in the house and Ive only got
rum and milk You can have that if you like

One of the pilgrims broke out here

Well of all the pubs he began that Ive ever

Hushshsh said the publican

The pilgrim scowled and retired to the rear You cant express your
feelings freely when theres a woman dying close handy

Well who says rum and milk asked the joker in a low voice

Wait here said the publican and disappeared into the little front
passage

Presently a light showed through a window with a scratched and
flybitten B and A on two panes and a mutilated R on the third which
was broken A door opened and we sneaked into the bar It was like
having drinks after hours where the police are strict and independent

When we came out the driver was scratching his head and looking at the
harness on the verandah floor

You fellows ll have ter put in the time for an hour or so The horses
is out back somewheres and he indicated the interior of Australia with
a side jerk of his head and the boy aint back with em yet

But dash it all said the Pilgrim me and my mate

Hush said the publican

How long are the horses likely to be we asked the driver

Dunno he grunted Might be three or four hours Its all accordin

Now look here said the Pilgrim me and my mate wanter catch the
train

Hushshsh from the publican in a fierce whisper

Well boss said the joker can you let us have beds then I dont
want to freeze here all night anyway

Yes said the landlord I can do that but some of you will have to
sleep double and some of youll have to take it out of the sofas and
one or two ll have to make a shakedown on the floor Theres plenty of
bags in the stable and youve got rugs and coats with you Fix it up
amongst yourselves

But look here interrupted the Pilgrim desperately we cant afford
to wait Were only battlers me and my mate pickin up crumbs by the
wayside Weve got to catch the

Hush said the publican savagely You fool didnt I tell you my
missus was bad I wont have any noise

But look here protested the Pilgrim we must catch the train at Dead
Camel

Youll catch my boot presently said the publican with a savage oath
and go further than Dead Camel I wont have my missus disturbed
for you or any other man Just you shut up or get out and take your
blooming mate with you

We lost patience with the Pilgrim and sternly took him aside

Now for Gods sake hold your jaw we said Havent you got any
consideration at all Cant you see the mans wife is illdying
perhapsand he nearly worried off his head

The Pilgrim and his mate were scraggy little bipeds of the city push
variety so they were suppressed

Well yawned the joker Im not going to roost on a stump all night
Im going to turn in

Itll be eighteenpence each hinted the landlord You can settle now
if you like to save time

We took the hint and had another drink I dont know how we fixed it
up amongst ourselves but we got settled down somehow There was a lot
of mysterious whispering and scuffling round by the light of a couple of
dirty greasy bits of candle Fortunately we dared not speak loud enough
to have a row though most of us were by this time in the humour to pick
a quarrel with a longlost brother

The Joker got the best bed as goodhumoured goodnatured chaps
generally do without seeming to try for it The growler of the party
got the floor and chaff bags as selfish men mostly dowithout seeming
to try for it either I took it out of one of the sofas or rather
that sofa took it out of me It was short and narrow and down by the
head with a leaning to one corner on the outside and had more nails
and bits of gincase than original sofa in it

I had been asleep for three seconds it seemed when somebody shook me
by the shoulder and said

Take yer seats

When I got out the driver was on the box and the others were getting
rum and milk inside themselves and in bottles before taking their
seats

It was colder and darker than before and the South Pole seemed nearer
and pretty soon but for the rum we should have been in a worse fix
than before

There was a spell of grumbling Presently someone said

I dont believe them horses was lost at all I was round behind the
stable before I went to bed and seen horses there and if they wasnt
them same horses there Ill eat em raw

Would yer said the driver in a disinterested tone

I would said the passenger Then with a sudden ferocity and you
too

The driver said nothing It was an abstract question which didnt
interest him

We saw that we were on delicate ground and changed the subject for a
while Then someone else said

I wonder where his missus was I didnt see any signs of her about or
any other woman about the place and we was pretty well all over it

Must have kept her in the stable suggested the Joker

No she wasnt for Scotty and that chap on the roof was there after
bags

She might have been in the loft reflected the Joker

There was no loft put in a voice from the top of the coach

I say MisterMister man said the Joker suddenly to the driver Was
his missus sick at all

I dunno replied the driver She might have been He said so anyway
I aint got no call to call a man a liar

See here said the cannibalistic individual to the driver in the tone
of a man who has made up his mind for a row has that shantykeeper got
a wife at all

I believe he has

And is she living with him

No she aintif yer wanter know

Then where is she

I dunno How am I to know She left him three or four years ago She
was in Sydney last time I heard of her It aint no affair of mine
anyways

And is there any woman about the place at all driver inquired a
professional wanderer reflectively

Nonot that I knows on There useter be a old black gin come pottering
round sometimes but I aint seen her lately

And excuse me driver but is there anyone round there at all
enquired the professional wanderer with the air of a conscientious
writer collecting material for an Australian novel from life with an
eye to detail

Naw said the driverand recollecting that he was expected to be
civil and obliging to his employers patrons he added in surly apology
Only the boss and the stableman that I knows of Then repenting
of the apology he asserted his manhood again and asked in a
tone calculated to risk a breach of the peace Any more questions
gentlemenwhile the shops open

There was a long pause

Driver asked the Pilgrim appealingly was them horses lost at all

I dunno said the driver He said they was Hes got the looking
after them It was nothing to do with me

     

Twelve drinks at sixpence a drinksaid the Joker as if calculating
to himselfthats six bob and say on an average four shoutsthats
one pound four Twelve beds at eighteenpence a bedthats eighteen
shillings and say ten bob in various drinks and the stuff we brought
with us thats two pound twelve That publican didnt do so bad out of
us in two hours

We wondered how much the driver got out of it but thought it best not
to ask him

     

We didnt say much for the rest of the journey There was the usual man
who thought as much and knew all about it from the first but he
wasnt appreciated We suppressed him One or two wanted to go back and
stoush that landlord and the driver stopped the coach cheerfully at
their request but they said theyd come across him again and allowed
themselves to be persuaded out of it It made us feel bad to think how
we had allowed ourselves to be delayed and robbed and had sneaked
round on tiptoe and how we had sat on the inoffensive Pilgrim and his
mate and all on account of a sick wife who didnt exist

The coach arrived at Dead Camel in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and
distrust and we spread ourselves over the train and departed




A Gentleman Sharper and Steelman Sharper



Steelman and Smith had been staying at the hotel for several days in the
dress and character of bushies down for what they considered a spree
The gentleman sharper from the Other Side had been hanging round
them for three days now Steelman was the more sociable and to all
appearances the greener of the two bush mates but seemed rather
too much under the influence of Smith who was reserved suspicious
selfcontained or sulky He almost scowled at Gentleman Sharpers
Goodmorning and Fine day replied in monosyllables and turned
half away with an uneasy sullen resentful hump of his shoulder and
shuffle of his feet

Steelman took Smith for a stroll on the round bald tussock hills
surrounding the city and rehearsed him for the last act until after
sundown

Gentleman Sharper was lounging with a cigar on the end of the balcony
where he had been contentedly contemplating the beautiful death of day
His calm classic features began to whiten and sharpen in the frosty
moonlight

Steelman and Smith sat on deckchairs behind a halfscreen of ferns
on the other end of the balcony smoked their afterdinner smoke and
talked in subdued tones as befitted the time and the scenegreat
softened misty hills in a semicircle and the water and harbour lights
in moonlight

The other boarders were loitering over dinner in their rooms or gone
out the three were alone on the balcony which was a rear one

Gentleman Sharper moved his position carelessly noiselessly yet
quickly until he leaned on the rail close to the ferns and could
overhear every word the bushies said He had dropped his cigar
overboard and his scented handkerchief behind a fernpot en route

But he looks all right and acts all right and talks all rightand
shouts all right protested Steelman Hes not stumped for I saw
twenty or thirty sovereigns when he shouted and he doesnt seem to care
a damn whether we stand in with him or not

There you are Thats just where it is said Smith with some
logic but in a tone a wife uses in argument which tone by the way
especially if backed by logic or common sense makes a man wild sooner
than anything else in this world of troubles

Steelman jerked his chair halfround in disgust Thats you he
snorted always suspicious Always suspicious of everybody and
everything If I found myself shot into a world where I couldnt trust
anybody Id shoot myself out of it Life would be worse than not worth
living Smith youll never make money except by hard grafthard
bullocking niggerdriving graft like we had on that damned railway
section for the last six months up to our knees in water all winter
and all for a paltry cheque of onefiftytwenty of that gone already
How do you expect to make money in this country if you wont take
anything for granted except hard cash I tell you Smith theres
a thousand pounds lost for every one gained or saved by trusting too
little How did Vanderbilt and

Steelman elaborated to a climax slipping a glance warily once or
twice out of the tail of his eye through the ferns low down

There never was a fortune made that wasnt made by chancing it

He nudged Smith to come to the point Presently Smith asked sulkily

Well what was he saying

I thought I told you He says hes behind the scenes in this gold boom
and if he had a hundred pounds ready cash tomorrow hed make three of
it before Saturday He said he could put onefifty to onefifty

And isnt he worth three hundred

Didnt I tell you demanded Steelman with an impatient ring and
speaking rapidly that he lost his mail in the wreck of the Tasman
You know she went down the day before yesterday and the divers havent
got at the mails yet

Yes But why doesnt he wire to Sydney for some stuff

Im Well I suppose Ill have to have patience with a born
natural Look here Smith the fact of the matter is that hes a sort of
blacksheepsent out on the remittance system if the truth is known
and with letters of introduction to some bigbugs out herethat
explains how he gets to know these wirepullers behind the boom His
people have probably got the quarterly allowance business fixed hard
and tight with a bank or a lawyer in Sydney and therell have to be
enquiries about the lost draft as he calls a cheque and a letter or
maybe a cable home to England and it might take weeks

Yes said Smith hesitatingly That all sounds right enough
Butwith an inspirationwhy dont he go to one of these bigbug
boomsters he knowsthat he got letters of introduction toand get him
to fix him up

Oh Lord exclaimed Steelman hopelessly Listen to him Cant you
see that theyre the last men he wants to let into his game Why he
wants to use THEM Theyre the mugs as far as he is concerned

OhI see said Smith after hesitating and rather slowlyas if he
hadnt quite finished seeing yet

Steelman glanced furtively at the fernscreen and nudged Smith again

He said if he had three hundred hed double it by Saturday

Thats what he said replied Steelman seeming by his tone to be
losing interest in the conversation

And well if he had a hundred he could double that I suppose

Yes What are you driving at now

If he had twenty

Oh God Im sick of you Smith What the

Hold on Let me finish I was only going to say that Im willing to put
up a fiver and you put up another fiver and if he doubles that for us
then we can talk about standing in with him with a hundredprovided he
can show his hundred

After some snarling Steelman said Well Ill try him Now are you
satisfied

Hes moved off now he added in a whisper but stay here and talk a
bit longer

Passing through the hall they saw Gentleman Sharper standing carelessly
by the door of the private bar He jerked his head in the direction of
drinks Steelman accepted the invitationSmith passed on Steelman took
the opportunity to whisper to the SharperIve been talking that over
with my mate and

Come for a stroll suggested the professional

I dont mind said Steelman

Have a cigar and they passed out

When they returned Steelman went straight to the room he occupied with
Smith

How much stuff have we got Smith

Nine pounds seventeen and threepence

Steelman gave an exclamation of disapproval with that state of financial
affairs He thought a second I know the barman here and I think he
knows me Ill chew his lug for a bob or may be a quid

Twenty minutes later he went to Gentleman Sharpers room with ten
poundsin very dirty Bank of New Zealand notessuch as those with
which bush contractors pay their men

Two mornings later the sharper suggested a stroll Steelman went with
him with a face carefully made up to hear the worst

After walking a hundred yards in a silence which might have been
ominousand was certainly pregnantthe sharper said

Well I tried the water

Yes said Steelman in a nervous tone And how did you find it

Just as warm as I thought Warm for a big splash

How Did you lose the ten quid

Lose it What did you take me for I put ten to your ten as I told you
I would I landed 50 Pounds

Fifty pounds for twenty

Thats the tune of itand not much of a tune either My God If Id
only had that thousand of mine by me or even half of it Id have made
a pile

Fifty pounds for twenty cried Steelman excitedly Why thats grand
And to think we chaps have been grafting like niggers all our lives By
God well stand in with you for all weve got

Theres my hand on it as they reached the hotel

If you come to my room Ill give you the 25 Pounds now if you like

Oh thats all right exclaimed Steelman impulsively you mustnt
think I dont

Thats all right Dont you say any more about it Youd best have the
stuff tonight to show your mate

Perhaps so hes a suspicious fool but I made a bargain with him about
our last cheque He can hang on to the stuff and I cant If Id been
on my own Id have blued it a week ago Tell you what Ill dowell
call our share Smiths and mine twenty quid You take the odd fiver
for your trouble

That looks fair enough Well call it twenty guineas to you and your
mate Well want him you know

In his own and Smiths room Steelman thoughtfully counted twentyone
sovereigns on the toilettable cover and left them there in a pile

He stretched himself scratched behind his ear and blinked at the money
abstractedly Then he asked as if the thought just occurred to him By
the way Smith do you see those yellow boys

Smith saw He had been sitting on the bed with a studiously vacant
expression It was Smiths policy not to seem except by request to
take any interest in or in fact to be aware of anything unusual that
Steelman might be doingfrom patching his pants to reading poetry

Theres twentyone sovereigns there remarked Steelman casually

Yes

Ten of ems yours

Thank yer Steely

And added Steelman solemnly and grimly if you get taken down for
em or lose em out of the tophole in your pocket or spend so much as
a shilling in riotous living Ill stoush you Smith

Smith didnt seem interested They sat on the beds opposite each other
for two or three minutes in something of the atmosphere that pervades
things when conversation has petered out and the dinnerbell is expected
to ring Smith screwed his face and squeezed a pimple on his throat
Steelman absently counted the flies on the wall Presently Steelman
with a yawning sigh lay back on the pillow with his hands clasped under
his head

Better take a few quid Smith and get that suit you were looking
at the other day Get a couple of shirts and collars and some socks
better get a hat while youre at ityours is a disgrace to your
benefactor And I say go to a chemist and get some cough stuff for
that churchyarder of yoursweve got no use for it just now and it
makes me sentimental Ill give you a cough when you want one Bring me
a syphon of soda some fruit and a tract

A what

A tract Go on Start your boots

While Smith was gone Steelman paced the room with a strange worried
haunted expression He divided the gold that was leftSmith had taken
four poundsand put ten sovereigns in a pile on the extreme corner
of the table Then he walked up and down up and down the room arms
tightly folded and forehead knitted painfully pausing abruptly now
and then by the table to stare at the gold until he heard Smiths step
Then his face cleared he sat down and counted flies

Smith was undoing and inspecting the parcels having placed the syphon
and fruit on the table Behind his back Steelman hurriedly opened a
leather pocketbook and glanced at the portrait of a woman and child and
at the date of a postoffice order receipt

Smith said Steelman were two honest ignorant green coves
hardworking chaps from the bush

Yes

It doesnt matter whether we are or notwe are as far as the world
is concerned Now weve grafted like bullocks in heat and wet for six
months and made a hundred and fifty and come down to have a bit of a
holiday before going back to bullock for another six months or a year
Isnt that so Smith

Yes

You could take your oath on it

Yes

Well it doesnt matter if it is so or notit IS so so far as the
world is concerned Now weve paid our way straight Weve always been
pretty straight anyway even if we are a pair of vagabonds and I dont
half like this new business but it had to be done If I hadnt taken
down that sharper youd have lost confidence in me and wouldnt have
been able to mask your feelings and Id have had to stoush you Were
two hardworking innocent bushies down for an innocent spree and we
run against a coldblooded professional sharper a paltry sneak and
a coward whos got neither the brains nor the pluck to work in the
station of life he togs himself for He tries to do us out of our
hardearned little hundred and fiftyno matter whether we had it or
notand Im obliged to take him down Serve him right for a crawler
You havent the least idea what Im driving at Smith and thats the
best of it Ive driven a nail of my life home and no pincers ever made
will get it out

Why Steely whats the matter with you

Steelman rose took up the pile of ten sovereigns and placed it neatly
on top of the rest

Put the stuff away Smith

After breakfast next morning Gentleman Sharper hung round a bit and
then suggested a stroll But Steelman thought the weather looked
too bad so they went on the balcony for a smoke They talked of the
weather wrecks and things Steelman leaning with his elbows on the
balcony rail and Sharper sociably and confidently in the same position
close beside him But the professional was evidently growing uneasy in
his mind his side of the conversation grew awkward and disjointed
and he made the blunder of drifting into an embarrassing silence before
coming to the point He took one elbow from the rail and said with a
bungling attempt at carelessness which was made more transparent by the
awkward pause before it

Ah well I must see to my correspondence By the way when could you
make it convenient to let me have that hundred The shares are starting
up the last rise now and weve got no time to lose if we want to double
it

Steelman turned his face to him and winked oncea very hard tight
cold winka wink in which there was no humour such a wink as Steelman
had once winked at a halfdrunken bully who was going to have a lark
with Smith

The sharper was one of those men who pull themselves together in a bad
cause as they stagger from the blow But he wanted to think this time

Later on he approached Steelman quietly and proposed partnership But
Steelman gave him to understand as between themselves that he wasnt
taking on any pupils just then




An Incident at Stiffners



They called him Stiffner because he used long before to get a living
by poisoning wild dogs near the Queensland border The name stuck to
him closer than misfortune did for when he rose to the proud and
independent position of landlord and sole proprietor of an outback pub
he was Stiffner still and his place was Stiffnerswidely known

They do say that the name ceased not to be applicablethat it fitted
even better than in the old dingo days butwell they do say so All
we can say is that when a shearer arrived with a cheque and had a drink
or two he was almost invariably seized with a desire to camp on the
premises for good spend his cheque in the shortest possible time and
forcibly shout for everything within hailincluding the Chinaman cook
and Stiffners disreputable old ram

The shanty was of the usual kind and the scenery is as easily disposed
of There was a great grey plain stretching away from the door in front
and a mulga scrub from the rear and in that scrub not fifty yards from
the kitchen door were half a dozen nameless graves

Stiffner was always drunk and Stiffners wifea hardfeatured
Amazonwas boss The children were brought up in a detached cottage
under the care of a governess

Stiffner had a barmaid as a bait for chequemen She came from Sydney
they said and her name was Alice She was tall boyishly handsome and
characterless her figure might be described as fine or strapping
but her face was very coldnearly colourless She was one of those
selfishly sensual womenthin lips and hard almost vacant grey eyes
no thought of anything but her own pleasures none for the mans Some
shearers would roughly call her a squatters girl But she drew
she was handsome where women are scarcevery handsome thought a
tall melancholylooking jackeroo whose evil spirit had drawn him to
Stiffners and the last shilling out of his pocket

Over the great grey plain about a fortnight before had come Old
Danny a station hand for his semiannual spree and one Yankee Jack
and his mate shearers with horses travelling for grass and about a
week later the Sydney jackeroo There was also a sprinkling of assorted
swagmen who came in through the scrub and went out across the plain
or came in over the plain and went away through the scrub according to
which way their noses led them for the time being

There was also for one day a tall freckled native son of a
neighbouring cocky without a thought beyond the narrow horizon
within which he lived He had a very big opinion of himself in a very
small mind He swaggered into the breakfastroom and round the table to
his place with an expression of ignorant contempt on his phiz his
snub nose in the air and his under lip out But during the meal he
condescended to ask the landlord if hed noticed that there horse that
chap was ridin yesterday and Stiffner having intimated that he had
the native entertained the company with his opinion of that horse and
of a certain youngster he was breaking in at home and divers other
horses mostly his or his fathers and of a certain cattle slut c
He spoke at the landlord but to the company most of the time After
breakfast he swaggered round some more but condescended to shove
his hand into his trousers pull out a bob and chuck it into the
blanky hat for a pool Those words express the thing better than any
others we can think of Finally he said he must be off and there
being no opposition to his departure he chucked his saddle on to his
horse chucked himself into the saddle said slong and slithered
off And no one missed him

Danny had been there a fortnight and consequently his personal
appearance was not now worth describingit was better left alone
for the honour of the bush His hobby was that he was the strangers
friend as he put it Hed welcome the stranger and chum with him
and shout for him to an unlimited extent and sympathise with him hear
of jobs or a show for him assure him twenty times a day that he was
his friend give him hints and advice more or less worthless make him
drunk if possible and keep him so while the cheque lasted in short
Danny would do almost anything for the stranger except lend him a
shilling or give him some rations to carry him on Hed promise that
many times a day but hed sooner spend five pounds on drink for a man
than give him a farthing

Dannys cheque was nearly gone and it was time he was gone too in
fact he had received and was still receiving various hints to that
effect some of them decidedly pointed especially the more recent ones
But Danny was of late becoming foolishly obstinate in his sprees and
less disposed to git when a landlord had done with him He saw the
hints plainly enough but had evidently made up his mind to be doggedly
irresponsive It is a mistake to think that drink always dulls a
mans feelings Some natures are all the more keenly sensitive when
alcoholically poisoned

Danny was always front man at the shanty while his cheque was freshat
least so he was given to understand and so he apparently understood
He was then allowed to say and do what he liked almost even to mauling
the barmaid about There was scarcely any limit to the free and easy
manner in which you could treat her so long as your money lasted She
wouldnt be offended it wasnt business to be sodidnt pay But as
soon as your title to the cheque could be decently shelved you had to
treat her like a lady Danny knew thisnone better but he had been
treated with too much latitude and rushed to his destruction

It was Sunday afternoon but that made no difference in things at the
shanty Dinner was just over The men were in the mean little parlour
off the bar interested in a game of cards and Alice sat in one corner
sewing Danny was acting the goat round the fireplace as illluck
would have it his attention was drawn to a basket of clean linen which
stood on the side table and from it with sundry winks and grimaces
he gingerly lifted a certain garment of ladies underwearto put the
matter decently He held it up between his forefingers and thumbs and
cracked a rough foolish jokeno matter what it was The laugh didnt
last long Alice sprang to her feet flinging her work aside and struck
a stage attitudeher right arm thrown out and the forefinger pointing
rigidly and rather crookedly towards the door

Leave the room she snapped at Danny Leave the room How dare you
talk like that before meeee

Danny made a step and paused irresolutely He was sober enough to feel
the humiliation of his position and having once been a man of spirit
and having still the remnants of manhood about him he did feel it He
gave one pitiful appealing look at her face but saw no mercy there
She stamped her foot again jabbed her forefinger at the door and said
Gooo in a tone that startled the majority of the company nearly as
much as it did Danny Then Yankee Jack threw down his cards rose from
the table laid his strong shapely right handnot roughlyon Dannys
ragged shoulder and engineered the drunk gently through the door

Yous better go out for a while Danny he said there wasnt much
harm in what you said but your cheques gone and that makes all the
difference Its time you went back to the station Youve got to be
careful what you say now

When Jack returned to the parlour the barmaid had a smile for him but
he didnt take it He went and stood before the fire with his foot
resting on the fender and his elbow on the mantelshelf and looked
blackly at a print against the wall before his face

The old beast said Alice referring to Danny He ought to be kicked
off the place

HES AS GOOD AS YOU

The voice was Jacks he flung the stab over his shoulder and with it a
look that carried all the contempt he felt

She gasped looked blankly from face to face and witheringly at the
back of Jacks head but that didnt change colour or curl the least
trifle less closely

Did you hear that she cried appealing to anyone Youre a nice lot
o men you are to sit there and hear a woman insulted and not one of
you man enough to take her partcowards

The Sydney jackeroo rose impulsively but Jack glanced at him and he
sat down again She covered her face with her hands and ran hysterically
to her room

That afternoon another bushman arrived with a cheque and shouted five
times running at a pound a shout and at intervals during the rest of
the day when they werent fighting or gambling

Alice had got over her temper seemingly and was even kind to the
humble and contrite Danny who became painfully particular with his
Thanky Aliceand afterwards offensive with his unnecessarily
frequent threats to smash the first man who insulted her

But let us draw the curtain close before that Sunday afternoon at
Stiffners and hold it tight Behind it the great curse of the West is
in evidence the chief trouble of unionismdrink in its most selfish
barren and useless form

     

All was quiet at Stiffners It was after midnight and Stiffner lay
deaddrunk on the broad of his back on the long moonlit verandah
with all his patrons asleep around him in various grotesque positions
Stiffners ragged grey head was on a cushion and a broad maudlin smile
on his red drinksodden face the lower half of which was bordered by
a dirty grey beard like that of a frilled lizard The red handkerchief
twisted round his neck had a ghastly effect in the bright moonlight
making him look as if his throat was cut The smile was the one he
went to sleep with when his wife slipped the cushion under his head and
thoughtfully removed the loose change from about his person Near him
lay a heap that was Danny and spread over the bare boards were the
others some with heads pillowed on their swags and every man about as
drunk as his neighbour Yankee Jack lay across the door of the barmaids
bedroom with one arm bent under his head the other lying limp on the
doorstep his handsome face turned out to the bright moonlight The
family were sound asleep in the detached cottage and Alicethe only
capable person on the premiseswas left to put out the lamps and shut
up for the night She extinguished the light in the bar came out
locked the door and picked her way among and over the drunkards to the
end of the verandah She clasped her hands behind her head stretched
herself and yawned and then stood for a few moments looking out into
the night which softened the ragged line of mulga to right and
left and veiled the awful horizon of that great plain with which the
traveller commenced or ended the thirtymile dry stretch Then she
moved towards her own door before it she halted and stood with folded
arms looking down at the drunken Adonis at her feet

She breathed a long breath with a sigh in it went round to the back
and presently returned with a buggycushion which she slipped under his
headher face close to hisvery close Then she moved his arms gently
off the threshold stepped across him into her room and locked the door
behind her

There was an uneasy movement in the heap that stood or lay for Danny
It stretched out turned over struggled to its hands and knees and
became an object Then it crawled to the wall against which it
slowly and painfully upended itself and stood blinking round for
the waterbag which hung from the verandah rafters in a line with its
shapeless red nose It staggered forward held on by the cords felt
round the edge of the bag for the tot and drank about a quart of water
Then it staggered back against the wall stood for a moment muttering
and passing its hand aimlessly over its poor ruined head and finally
collapsed into a shapeless rumsmelling heap and slept once more

The jackeroo at the end of the verandah had awakened from his drunken
sleep but had not moved He lay huddled on his side with his head on
the swag the whole length of the verandah was before him his eyes
were wide open but his face was in the shade Now he rose painfully and
stood on the ground outside with his hands in his pockets and gazed
out over the open for a while He breathed a long breath toowith a
groan in it Then he lifted his swag quietly from the end of the floor
shouldered it took up his waterbag and billy and sneaked over the
road away from the place like a thief He struck across the plain and
tramped on hour after hour mile after mile till the bright moon went
down with a bright star in attendance and the other bright stars waned
and he entered the timber and tramped through it to the cleared road
which stretched far and wide for twenty miles before him with ghostly
little dustclouds at short intervals ahead where the frightened
rabbits crossed it And still he went doggedly on with the ghastly
daylight on himlike a swagmans ghost out late And a mongrel followed
faithfully all the time unnoticed and wondering perhaps at his
master

What was yer doin to that girl yesterday asked Danny of Yankee Jack
next evening as they camped on the far side of the plain What was you
chaps sayin to Alice I heerd her cryin in her room last night

But they reckoned that he had been too drunk to hear anything except an
invitation to come and have another drink and so it passed




The Hero of Redclay



The bossovertheboard was leaning with his back to the wall between
two shoots reading a reference handed to him by a greenhand applying
for work as pickerup or woolrollera shed rouseabout It was terribly
hot I was slipping past to the rollingtables carrying three fleeces
to save a journey we were only supposed to carry two The boss stopped
me

Youve got three fleeces there young man

Yes

Notwithstanding the fact that I had just slipped a light ragged fleece
into the bellywool and bits basket I felt deeply injured and
righteously and fiercely indignant at being pulled up It was a
fearfully hot day

If I catch you carrying three fleeces again said the boss quietly
Ill give you the sack

Ill take it now if you like I said

He nodded You can go on pickingup in this mans place he said
to the jackeroo whose reference showed him to be a nonunion mana
freelabourer as the pastoralists had it or in plain shed terms a
blanky scab He was now in the comfortable position of a nonunionist
in a union shed who had jumped into a sacked mans place

Somehow the lurid sympathy of the men irritated me worse than the
bossovertheboard had done It must have been on account of the heat
as Mitchell says I was sick of the shed and the life It was within a
couple of days of cutout so I told Mitchellwho was shearingthat
Id camp up the Billabong and wait for him got my cheque rolled up
my swag got three days tucker from the cook said solong to him and
tramped while the men were in the shed

I camped at the head of the Billabong where the track branched one
branch running to Bourke up the river and the other out towards the
Parooand hell

About ten oclock the third morning Mitchell came along with his cheque
and his swag and a new sheeppup and his quiet grin and I wasnt too
pleased to see that he had a shearer called the Lachlan with him

The Lachlan wasnt popular at the shed He was a brooding unsociable
sort of man and it didnt make any difference to the chaps whether he
had a union ticket or not It was pretty well known in the shedthere
were three or four chaps from the district he was reared inthat hed
done five years hard for burglary What surprised me was that Jack
Mitchell seemed thick with him often when the Lachlan was sitting
brooding and smoking by himself outside the hut after sunset Mitchell
would perch on his heels alongside him and yarn But no one else took
notice of anything Mitchell did out of the common

Better camp with us till the cool of the evening said Mitchell to
the Lachlan as they slipped their swags Plenty time for you to start
after sundown if youre going to travel tonight

So the Lachlan was going to travel all night and on a different track I
felt more comfortable and put the billy on I did not care so much what
hed been or had done but I was green and soft yet and his presence
embarrassed me

They talked shearing sheds tracks and a little unionismthe Lachlan
speaking in a quiet voice and with a lot of sound common sense it
seemed to me He was tall and gaunt and might have been thirty or even
well on in the forties His eyes were dark brown and deep set and had
something of the deadearnest sad expression you saw in the eyes of
union leaders and secretariesthe straight men of the strikes of 90
and 91 I fancied once or twice I saw in his eyes the sudden furtive
look of the bad egg when a mounted trooper is spotted near the shed
but perhaps this was prejudice And with it all there was about the
Lachlan something of the man who has lost all he had and the chances
of all he was ever likely to have and is past feeling or caring or
flaring uppast getting mad about anythingsomething all the same
that warned men not to make free with him

He and Mitchell fished along the Billabong all the afternoon I fished
a little and lay about the camp and read I had an instinct that the
Lachlan saw I didnt cotton on to his camping with us though he wasnt
the sort of man to show what he saw or felt After tea and a smoke at
sunset he shouldered his swag nodded to me as if I was an accidental
but respectful stranger at a funeral that belonged to him and took the
outside track Mitchell walked along the track with him for a mile or
so while I poked round and got some boughs down for a bed and fed and
studied the collie pup that Jack had bought from the shearers cook

I saw them stop and shake hands out on the dusty clearing and they
seemed to take a long time about it then Mitchell started back and
the other began to dwindle down to a black peg and then to a dot on the
sandy plain that had just a hint of dusk and dreamy faraway gloaming
on it between the change from glaring day to hard bare broad
moonlight

I thought Mitchell was sulky or had got the blues when he came back
he lay on his elbow smoking with his face turned from the camp towards
the plain After a bit I got wildif Mitchell was going to go on like
that he might as well have taken his swag and gone with the Lachlan I
dont know exactly what was the matter with me that day and at last I
made up my mind to bring the thing to a head

You seem mighty thick with the Lachlan I said

Well whats the matter with that asked Mitchell It aint the first
felon Ive been on speaking terms with I borrowed halfacaser off a
murderer once when I was in a hole and had no one else to go to and
the murderer hadnt served his time neither Ive got nothing against
the Lachlan except that hes a white man and bears a faint family
resemblance to a certain branch of my tribe

I rolled out my swag on the boughs got my pipe tobacco and matches
handy in the crown of a spare hat and lay down

Mitchell got up relit his pipe at the fire and mooned round for
a while with his hands behind him kicking sticks out of the road
looking out over the plain down along the Billabong and up through the
mulga branches at the stars then he comforted the pup a bit shoved the
fire together with his toe stood the teabilly on the coals and came
and squatted on the sand by my head

Joe Ill tell you a yarn

All right fire away Has it got anything to do with the Lachlan

No Its got nothing to do with the Lachlan now but its about a chap
he knew Dont you ever breathe a word of this to the Lachlan or anyone
or hell get on to me

All right Go ahead

You know Ive been a good many things in my time I did a deal of
housepainting at one time I was a pretty smart brush hand and made
money at it Well I had a run of work at a place called Redclay on the
Lachlan side You know the sort of towntwo pubs a general store a
post office a blacksmiths shop a police station a branch bank and
a dozen private weatherboard boxes on piles with galvanizediron tops
besides the humpies There was a paper there too called the Redclay
Advertiser with which was incorporated the Geebung Chronicle and
a Roman Catholic church a Church of England and a Wesleyan chapel
Now you see more of private life in the housepainting line than in
any otherbar plumbing and gasfitting but Ill tell you about my
housepainting experiences some other time

There was a young chap named Jack Drew editing the Advertiser then
He belonged to the district but had been sent to Sydney to a grammar
school when he was a boy He was between twentyfive and thirty had
knocked round a good deal and gone the pace in Sydney He got on as a
boy reporter on one of the big dailies he had brains and could
write rings round a good many but he got in with a crowd that called
themselves Bohemians and the drink got a hold on him The paper stuck
to him as long as it could for the sake of his brains but they had to
sack him at last

He went out back as most of them do to try and work out their
salvation and knocked round amongst the sheds He picked up in one
shed where I was shearing and we carried swags together for a couple
of months Then he went back to the Lachlan side and prospected amongst
the old fields round there with his elder brother Tom who was all there
was left of his family Tom by the way broke his heart digging Jack
out of a cave in a drive they were working and died a few minutes after
the rescue  But thats another yarn Jack Drew had a bad spree after
that then he went to Sydney again got on his old paper went to the
dogs and a Parliamentary push that owned some city flyblisters and
country papers sent him up to edit the Advertiser at two quid a
week He drank again and no wonderyou dont know what it is to run a
Geebung Advocate or Mudgee Budgee Chronicle and live there He was
about the same build as the Lachlan but stouter and had something the
same kind of eyes but he was ordinarily as careless and devilmaycare
as the Lachlan is grumpy and quiet

  See When the Sun Went Down in While the
 Billy Boils

There was a doctor there called Dr Lebinski They said he was a
Polish exile He was fifty or sixty a tall man with the set of an
old soldier when he stood straight but he mostly walked with his hands
behind him studying the ground Jack Drew caught that trick off
him towards the end They were chums in a gloomy way and kept to
themselvesthey were the only two men with brains in that town They
drank and fought the drink together The Doctor was too gloomy and
impatient over little things to be popular Jack Drew talked too
straight in the paper and in spite of his proprietorsabout pub
spieling and such thingsand was too sarcastic in his progress
committee town council and toady reception reports The Doctor had a
hawks nose pointed grizzled beard and moustache and steelygrey eyes
with a haunted look in them sometimes especially when he glanced at you
sideways as if he loathed his fellow men and couldnt always hide it
or as if you were the spirit of morphia or opium or a dead girl hed
wronged in his youthor whatever his devil was beside drink He was
clever and drink had brought him down to Redclay

The bank manager was a heavy snob named Browne He complained of being
a bit dull of hearing in one earafter youd yelled at him three or
four times sometimes Ive thought he was as deaf as a bookkeeper in
both He had a wife and youngsters but they were away on a visit while
I was working in Redclay His nieceor rather his wifes niecea
girl named Ruth Wilson did the housekeeping She was an orphan
adopted by her aunt and was general slavey and scapegoat to the
familyespecially to the brats as is often the case She was rather
pretty and ladylike and kept to herself The women and girls called
her Miss Wilson and didnt like her Most of the single menand some
of the married ones perhapswere gone on her but hadnt the brains
or the pluck to bear up and try their luck I was gone worse than any I
think but had too much experience or common sense She was very good to
meused to hand me out cups of tea and plates of sandwiches or bread
and butter or cake mornings and afternoons the whole time I was
painting the bank The Doctor had known her people and was very kind
to her She was about the only womanfor she was more woman than
girlthat hed brighten up and talk for Neither he nor Jack Drew were
particularly friendly with Browne or his push

The banker the storekeeper one of the publicans the butcher a
popular man with his hands in his pockets his hat on the back of his
head and nothing in it the postmaster and his toady the lightning
squirter were the scrubaristocracy The rest were crawlers mostly pub
spielers and bush larrikins and the women were hags and larrikinesses
The town lived on chequemen from the surrounding bush It was a nice
little place taking it all round

I remember a ball at the local town hall where the scrub aristocrats
took one end of the room to dance in and the ordinary scum the other
It was a saving in music Some day an Australian writer will come along
wholl remind the critics and readers of Dickens Carlyle and Thackeray
mixed and hell do justice to these little customs of ours in the
little settleddistrict towns of Democratic Australia This sort of
thing came to a head one New Years Night at Redclay when there was a
public ball and peace on earth and good will towards all menmostly
on account of a railway to Redclay being surveyed We were all there
Theyd got the Doc out of his shell to act as MC

One of the aristocrats was the daughter of the local storekeeper
she belonged to the lawntennis clique and they WERE select For some
reason or otherbecause she looked upon Miss Wilson as a slavey or
on account of a fancied slight or the heat working on ignorance or on
account of something that comes over girls and women that no son of sin
can account forthis Miss Teansugar tossed her head and refused
Miss Wilsons hand in the first set and so broke the ladies chain and
the dance Then there was a todo The Doctor held up his hand to stop
the music and said very quietly that he must call upon Miss Soandso
to apologise to Miss Wilsonor resign the chair After a lot of fuss
the girl did apologise in a snappy way that was another insult Jack
Drew gave Miss Wilson his arm and marched her off without a wordI saw
she was almost crying Some one said Oh lets go on with the dance
The Doctor flashed round on them but they were too paltry for him so
he turned on his heel and went out without a word But I was beneath
them again in social standing so there was nothing to prevent me from
making a few wellchosen remarks on things in generalwhich I did and
broke up that ball and broke some heads afterwards and got myself a
good deal of hatred and respect and two sweethearts and lost all the
jobs I was likely to get except at the bank the Doctors and the
Royal

One day it was raininggeneral rain for a week Rain rain rain over
ridge and scrub and galvanised iron and into the dismal creeks Id done
all my inside work except a bit under the Doctors verandah where hed
been having some patching and altering done round the glass doors of his
surgery where he consulted his patients I didnt want to lose time It
was a Monday and no day for the Royal and there was no dust so it was
a good day for varnishing I took a pot and brush and went along to give
the Doctors doors a coat of varnish The Doctor and Drew were inside
with a fire drinking whisky and smoking but I didnt know that when
I started work The rain roared on the iron roof like the sea All of a
sudden it held up for a minute and I heard their voices The doctor
had been shouting on account of the rain and forgot to lower his voice
Look here Jack Drew he said there are only two things for you
to do if you have any regard for that girl one is to stop this the
liquor I suppose he meant and pull yourself together and I dont
think youll do thatI know men The other is to throw up the
Advertiserits doing you no goodand clear out I wont do that
says Drew Then shoot yourself said the Doctor Theres another
flask in the cupboard You know what this hole is like Shes a good
true girla girl as God made her I knew her father and mother and I
tell you Jack Id sooner see her dead than The roof roared again
I felt a bit delicate about the business and didnt like to disturb
them so I knocked off for the day

About a week before that I was down in the bed of the Redclay Creek
fishing for tailers Id been getting on all right with the housemaid
at the Royalshe used to have plates of pudding and hot pie for me on
the big gridiron arrangement over the kitchen range and after the third
tuckout I thought it was good enough to do a bit of a bearup in that
direction She mentioned one day yarning that she liked a stroll by
the creek sometimes in the cool of the evening I thought shed be off
that day so I said Id go for a fish after Id knocked off I thought
I might get a bite Anyway I didnt catch Lizzietell you about that
some other time

It was Sunday Id been fishing for Lizzie about an hour when I saw a
skirt on the bank out of the tail of my eyeand thought Id got a bite
sure But I was had It was Miss Wilson strolling along the bank in the
sunset all by her pretty self She was a slight girl not very tall
with reddish frizzled hair grey eyes and small pretty features She
spoke as if she had more brains than the average and had been better
educated Jack Drew was the only young man in Redclay she could talk to
or who could talk to a girl like her and that was the whole trouble in
a nutshell The newspaper office was next to the bank and Id seen her
hand cups of tea and cocoa over the fence to his office window more than
once and sometimes they yarned for a while

She said Good morning Mr Mitchell

I said Good morning Miss

Theres some girls I cant talk to like Id talk to other girls She
asked me if Id caught any fish and I said No Miss She asked me if
it wasnt me down there fishing with Mr Drew the other evening and I
said Yesit was me Then presently she asked me straight if he
was fishing down the creek that afternoon I guessed theyd been down
fishing for each other before I said No I thought he was out of
town I knew he was pretty bad at the Royal I asked her if shed like
to have a try with my line but she said No thanks she must be going
and she went off up the creek I reckoned Jack Drew had got a bite and
landed her I felt a bit sorry for her too

The next Saturday evening after the rainy Monday at the Doctors I
went down to fish for tailersand Lizzie I went down under the banks
to where there was a big sheoak stump half in the water going quietly
with an idea of not frightening the fish I was just unwinding the line
from my rod when I noticed the end of another rod sticking out from
the other side of the stump and while I watched it was dropped into the
water Then I heard a murmur and craned my neck round the back of
the stump to see who it was I saw the back view of Jack Drew and
Miss Wilson he had his arm round her waist and her head was on his
shoulder She said I WILL trust you JackI know youll give up the
drink for my sake And Ill help you and well be so happy or words
in that direction A thunderstorm was coming on The sky had darkened
up with a great blueblack stormcloud rushing over and they hadnt
noticed it I didnt mind and the fish bit best in a storm But just
as she said happy came a blinding flash and a crash that shook the
ridges and the first drops came peltering down They jumped up and
climbed the bank while I perched on the sheoak roots over the water to
be out of sight as they passed Half way to the town I saw them standing
in the shelter of an old stone chimney that stood alone He had his
overcoat round her and was sheltering her from the wind

Smokeoh Joe The teas stewing

Mitchell got up stretched himself and brought the billy and pintpots
to the head of my camp The moon had grown misty The plain horizon
had closed in A couple of boughs hanging from the gnarled and blasted
timber over the billabong were the perfect shapes of two men hanging
side by side Mitchell scratched the back of his neck and looked down at
the pup curled like a glob of mud on the sand in the moonlight and an
idea struck him He got a big old felt hat he had lifted his pup nose
to tail fitted it in the hat shook it down holding the hat by the
brim and stood the hat near the head of his doss out of the moonlight
He might get moonstruck said Mitchell and I dont want that pup
to be a genius The pup seemed perfectly satisfied with this new
arrangement

Have a smoke said Mitchell You see he added with a sly grin
Ive got to make up the yarn as I go along and its hard work It
seems to begin to remind me of yarns your grandmother or aunt tells of
things that happened when she was a girlbut those yarns are true You
wont have to listen long now Im well on into the second volume

After the storm I hurried home to the tentI was batching with a
carpenter I changed my clothes made a fire in the firebucket with
shavings and ends of soft wood boiled the billy and had a cup of
coffee It was Saturday night My mate was at the Royal it was cold and
dismal in the tent and there was nothing to read so I reckoned I might
as well go up to the Royal too and put in the time

I had to pass the Bank on the way It was the usual weatherboard box
with a galvanised iron topfour rooms and a passage and a detached
kitchen and washhouse at the back the front room to the right behind
the office was the family bedroom and the one opposite it was the
living room The Advertiser office was next door Jack Drew camped
in a skillion room behind his printing office and had his meals at the
Royal I noticed the storm had taken a sheet of iron off the
skillion and supposed hed sleep at the Royal that night Next to the
Advertiser office was the police station still called the Police
Camp and the Courthouse Next was the Imperial Hotel where the scrub
aristocrats went There was a vacant allotment on the other side of the
Bank and I took a short cut across this to the Royal

Theyd forgotten to pull down the blind of the diningroom window and
I happened to glance through and saw she had Jack Drew in there and was
giving him a cup of tea He had a bad cold I remember and I suppose
his health had got precious to her poor girl As I glanced she stepped
to the window and pulled down the blind which put me out of face a
bitthough of course she hadnt seen me I was rather surprised at
her having Jack in there till I heard that the banker the postmaster
the constable and some others were making a night of it at the
Imperial as theyd been doing pretty often latelyand went on doing
till there was a blowup about it and the constable got transferred
Out Back I used to drink my share then We smoked and played cards
and yarned and filled em up again at the Royal till after one in the
morning Then I started home

Id finished giving the Bank a couple of coats of stonecolour that
week and was cutting in in dark colour round the spouting doors and
windowframes that Saturday My head was pretty clear going home and as
I passed the place it struck me that Id left out the only varnish brush
I had Id been using it to give the sashes a coat of varnish colour
and remembered that Id left it on one of the windowsillsthe sill
of her bedroom window as it happened I knew Id sleep in next day
Sunday and guessed it would be hot and I didnt want the varnish tool
to get spoiled so I reckoned Id slip in through the side gate get it
and take it home to camp and put it in oil The window sash was jammed
I remember and I hadnt been able to get it up more than a couple of
inches to paint the runs of the sash The grass grew up close under
the window and I slipped in quietly I noticed the sash was still up
a couple of inches Just as I grabbed the brush I heard low voices
insideRuth Wilsons and Jack Drewsin her room

The surprise sent about a pint of beer up into my throat in a lump I
tiptoed away out of there Just as I got clear of the gate I saw the
banker being helped home by a couple of cronies

I went home to the camp and turned in but I couldnt sleep I lay
thinkthinkthinking till I thought all the drink out of my head Id
brought a bottle of ale home to last over Sunday and I drank that It
only made matters worse I didnt know how I feltIwell I felt as
if I was as good a man as Jack DrewIyou see Iveyou might think it
softbut I loved that girl not as Ive been gone on other girls but
in the oldfashioned soft honest hopeless faraway sort of way and
now to tell the straight truth I thought I might have had her You
lose a thing through being too straight or sentimental or not having
enough cheek and another man comes along with more brass in his blood
and less sentimental rot and takes it upand the world respects him
and you feel in your heart that youre a weaker man than he is Why
part of the time I must have felt like a man does when a better man
runs away with his wife But Id drunk a lot and was upset and
lonelyfeeling that night

Oh but Redclay had a tremendous sensation next day Jack Drew of all
the men in the world had been caught in the act of robbing the bank
According to Brownes account in court and in the newspapers he
returned home that night at about twelve oclock which I knew was a
lie for I saw him being helped home nearer two and immediately retired
to rest on top of the quilt boots and all I suppose Some time
before daybreak he was roused by a fancied noise I suppose it was his
head swelling he rose turned up a night lamp he hadnt lit it
Ill swear and went through the diningroom passage and office to
investigate for whisky and water He saw that the doors and windows
were secure returned to bed and fell asleep again

There is something in a deaf persons being roused easily I know the
case of a deaf chap whod start up at a step or movement in the house
when no one else could hear or feel it keen sense of vibration I
reckon Well just at daybreak to shorten the yarn the banker woke
suddenly he said and heard a crack like a shot in the house There was
a loose flooringboard in the passage that went off like a pistolshot
sometimes when you trod on it and I guess Jack Drew trod on it
sneaking out and he weighed nearly twelve stone If the truth were
known he probably heard Browne poking round tried the window found
the sash jammed and was slipping through the passage to the back door
Browne got his revolver opened his door suddenly and caught Drew
standing between the girls door which was shut and the office door
with his coat on his arm and his boots in his hands Browne covered him
with his revolver swore hed shoot if he moved and yelled for help
Drew stood a moment like a man stunned then he rushed Browne and in
the struggle the revolver went off and Drew got hit in the arm Two of
the mounted trooperswhod been up looking to the horses for an early
start somewhererushed in then and took Drew He had nothing to say
What could he say He couldnt say he was a blackguard whod taken
advantage of a poor unprotected girl because she loved him They found
the back door unlocked by the way which was put down to the burglar
of course Browne couldnt explain that he came home too muddled to lock
doors after him

And the girl She shrieked and fell when the row started and they
found her like a log on the floor of her room after it was over

They found in Jacks overcoat pocket a parcel containing a cold chisel
small screwwrench file and one or two other things that hed bought
that evening to tinker up the old printing press I knew that because
Id lent him a hand a few nights before and he told me hed have to get
the tools They found some scratches round the keyhole and knob of the
office door that Id made myself scraping old splashes of paint off the
brass and handplate so as to make a clean finish Oh it taught me the
value of circumstantial evidence If I was judge I wouldnt give a man
till the risin av the coort on it any more than I would on the bare
word of the noblest woman breathing

At the preliminary examination Jack Drew said he was guilty But it
seemed that according to law he couldnt be guilty until after he was
committed So he was committed for trial at the next Quarter Sessions
The excitement and gabble were worse than the Dean case or Federation
and sickened me for they were all on the wrong track You lose a lot of
life through being behind the scenes But they cooled down presently to
wait for the trial

They thought it best to take the girl away from the place where shed
got the shock so the Doctor took her to his house where he had an old
housekeeper who was as deaf as a posta first class recommendation for
a housekeeper anywhere He got a nurse from Sydney to attend on Ruth
Wilson and no one except he and the nurse were allowed to go near
her She lay like dead they said except when she had to be held down
raving brain fever they said brought on by the shock of the attempted
burglary and pistol shot Dr Lebinski had another doctor up from Sydney
at his own expense but nothing could save herand perhaps it was as
well She might have finished her life in a lunatic asylum They were
going to send her to Sydney to a brain hospital but she died a week
before the Sessions She was rightheaded for an hour they said and
asking all the time for Jack The Doctor told her he was all right and
was comingand waiting and listening for him she died

The case was black enough against Drew now I knew he wouldnt have the
pluck to tell the truth now even if he was that sort of a man I didnt
know what to do so I spoke to the Doctor straight I caught him coming
out of the Royal and walked along the road with him a bit I suppose
he thought I was going to show cause why his doors ought to have another
coat of varnish

Hallo Mitchell he said hows painting

Doctor I said what am I going to do about this business

What business

Jack Drews

He looked at me sidewaysthe swift haunted look Then he walked on
without a word for half a dozen yards hands behind and studying the
dust Then he asked quite quietly

Do you know the truth

Yes

About a dozen yards this time then he said

Ill see him in the morning and see you afterwards and he shook
hands and went on home

Next day he came to me where I was doing a job on a step ladder He
leaned his elbow against the steps for a moment and rubbed his hand
over his forehead as if it ached and he was tired

Ive seen him Mitchell he said

Yes

You were mates with him once Out Back

I was

You know Drews handwriting

I should think so

He laid a leaf from a pocketbook on top of the steps I read the
message written in pencil

To Jack MitchellWe were mates on the track If you know anything of
my affair dont give it awayJ D

I tore the leaf and dropped the bits into the paintpot

Thats all right Doctor I said but is there no way

None

He turned away wearily Hed knocked about so much over the world
that he was past bothering about explaining things or being surprised at
anything But he seemed to get a new idea about me he came back to the
steps again and watched my brush for a while as if he was thinking
in a broody sort of way of throwing up his practice and going in for
housepainting Then he said slowly and deliberately

If shethe girlhad lived we might have tried to fix it up quietly
Thats what I was hoping for I dont see how we can help him now even
if hed let us He would never have spoken anyway We must let it
go on and after the trial Ill go to Sydney and see what I can do at
headquarters Its too late now You understand Mitchell

Yes Ive thought it out

Then he went away towards the Royal

And what could Jack Drew or we do Study it out whatever way you like
There was only one possible chance to help him and that was to go to
the judge and the judge that happened to be on that circuit was a man
whoeven if he did listen to the story and believe itwould have felt
inclined to give Jack all the more for what he was charged with Browne
was out of the question The day before the trial I went for a long walk
in the bush but couldnt hit on anything that the Doctor might have
missed

I was in the courtI couldnt keep away The Doctor was there too
There wasnt so much of a change in Jack as I expected only he had the
gaol white in his face already He stood fingering the rail as if it
was the edge of a table on a platform and he was a tired and bored and
sleepy chairman waiting to propose a vote of thanks

The only wellknown man in Australia who reminds me of Mitchell is Bland
Holt the comedian Mitchell was about as good hearted as Bland Holt
too under it all but he was bigger and roughened by the bush But he
seemed to be taking a heavy part tonight for towards the end of his
yarn he got up and walked up and down the length of my bed dropping
the sentences as he turned towards me Hed folded his arms high and
tight and his face in the moonlight waswell it was very different
from his careless tone of voice He was likelike an actor acting
tragedy and talking comedy Mitchell went on speaking quicklyhis
voice seeming to harden

     

The charge was read outI forget how it wentit sounded like a long
hymn being given out Jack pleaded guilty Then he straightened up for
the first time and looked round the court with a calm disinterested
lookas if we were all strangers and he was noting the size of the
meeting Andits a funny world aint iteveryone of us shifted
or dropped his eyes just as if we were the felons and Jack the judge
Everyone except the Doctor he looked at Jack and Jack looked at him
Then the Doctor smiledI cant describe itand Drew smiled back It
struck me afterwards that I should have been in that smile Then the
Doctor did what looked like a strange thingstood like a soldier with
his hands to Attention Id noticed that whenever hed made up his mind
to do a thing he dropped his hands to his sides it was a sign that he
couldnt be moved Now he slowly lifted his hand to his forehead palm
out saluted the prisoner turned on his heel and marched from the
courtroom Hes boozin again someone whispered Hes got a touch
of em My oath hes ratty said someone else One of the traps
said

Arder in the carrt

The judge gave it to Drew redhot on account of the burglary being the
cause of the girls death and the sorrow in a respectable family then
he gave him five years hard

It gave me a lot of confidence in myself to see the law of the land
barking up the wrong tree while only I and the Doctor and the prisoner
knew it But Ive found out since then that the law is often the only
one that knows its barking up the wrong tree

     

Mitchell prepared to turn in

And what about Drew I asked

Oh he did his time or most of it The Doctor went to headquarters
but either a drunken doctor from a geebung town wasnt of much account
or they werent taking any romance just then at headquarters So the
Doctor came back drank heavily and one frosty morning they found him
on his back on the bank of the creek with his face like notepaper
where the blood hadnt dried on it and an old pistol in his handthat
hed used they said to shoot Cossacks from horseback when he was a
young dude fighting in the bush in Poland

Mitchell lay silent a good while then he yawned

Ah well Its a lonely track the Lachlans tramping tonight but I
spose hes got his ghosts with him

Id been puzzling for the last halfhour to think where Id met or heard
of Jack Drew now it flashed on me that Id been told that Jack Drew was
the Lachlans real name

I lay awake thinking a long time and wished Mitchell had kept his yarn
for daytime I feltwell I felt as if the Lachlans story should have
been played in the biggest theatre in the world by the greatest actors
with music for the intervals and situationsdeep strong music such as
thrills and lifts a man from his boot soles And when I got to sleep I
hadnt slept a moment it seemed to me when I started wide awake to
see those infernal hanging boughs with a sort of nightmare idea that the
Lachlan hadnt gone or had come back and he and Mitchell had hanged
themselves sociablyMitchell for sympathy and the sake of mateship

But Mitchell was sleeping peacefully in spite of a path of moonlight
across his faceand so was the pup




The Darling River



The Darlingwhich is either a muddy gutter or a second Mississippiis
about six times as long as the distance in a straight line from its
head to its mouth The state of the river is vaguely but generally
understood to depend on some distant and foreign phenomena to which
bushmen refer in an offhand tone of voice as the Queenslan rains
which seem to be held responsible in a general way for most of the
outback trouble

It takes less than a year to go up stream by boat to Walgett or Bourke
in a dry season but after the first three months the passengers
generally go ashore and walk They get sick of being stuck in the same
sort of place in the same old way they grow weary of seeing the same
old whaler drop his swag on the bank opposite whenever the boat ties
up for wood they get tired of lending him tobacco and listening to his
ideas which are limited in number and narrow in conception

It shortens the journey to get out and walk but then you will have to
wait so long for your luggageunless you hump it with you

We heard of a man who determined to stick to a Darling boat and travel
the whole length of the river He was a newspaper man He started on
his voyage of discovery one Easter in floodtime and a month later the
captain got bushed between the Darling and South Australian border The
waters went away before he could find the river again and left his boat
in a scrub They had a cargo of rations and the crew stuck to the craft
while the tucker lasted when it gave out they rolled up their swags and
went to look for a station but didnt find one The captain would study
his watch and the sun rig up dials and make out courses and follow
them without success They ran short of water and didnt smell any
for weeks they suffered terrible privations and lost three of their
number NOT including the newspaper liar There are even dark hints
considering the drawing of lots in connection with something too
terrible to mention They crossed a thirtymile plain at last and
sighted a black gin She led them to a boundary riders hut where they
were taken in and provided with rations and rum

Later on a syndicate was formed to explore the country and recover the
boat but they found her thirty miles from the river and about eighteen
from the nearest waterhole deep enough to float her so they left her
there Shes there still or else the man that told us about it is the
greatest liar Out Back

     

Imagine the hull of a North Shore ferry boat blunted a little at the
ends and cut off about a foot below the waterline and parallel to it
then you will have something shaped somewhat like the hull of a Darling
mudrooter But the river boat is much stronger The boat we were on
was built and repaired above deck after the different ideas of many bush
carpenters of whom the last seemed by his work to have regarded the
original plan with a contempt only equalled by his disgust at the work
of the last carpenter but one The wheel was boxed in mostly with round
saplingsticks fastened to the frame with bunches of nails and spikes
of all shapes and sizes most of them bent The general result was
decidedly picturesque in its irregularity but dangerous to the mental
welfare of any passenger who was foolish enough to try to comprehend
the design for it seemed as though every carpenter had taken the
opportunity to work in a little abstract idea of his own

The way they dock a Darling River boat is beautiful for its
simplicity They choose a place where there are two stout trees about
the boats length apart and standing on a line parallel to the river
They fix pulleyblocks to the trees lay sliding planks down into the
water fasten a rope to one end of the steamer and take the other end
through the block attached to the tree and thence back aboard a second
steamer then they carry a rope similarly from the other end through the
block on the second tree and aboard a third boat At a given signal
one boat leaves for Wentworth and the other starts for the Queensland
border The consequence is that craft number one climbs the bank
amid the cheers of the local loafers who congregate and watch the
proceedings with great interest and approval The crew pitch tents and
set to work on the hull which looks like a big rough shallow box

     

We once travelled on the Darling for a hundred miles or so on a boat
called the Mud Turtleat least thats what WE called her She might
reasonably have haunted the Mississippi fifty years ago She didnt seem
particular where she went or whether she started again or stopped
for good after getting stuck Her machinery sounded like a chapter of
accidents and was always out of order but she got along all the same
provided the steersman kept her off the bank

Her skipper was a young man who looked more like a drover than a
sailor and the crew bore a greater resemblance to the unemployed than
to any other body we know of except that they looked a little
more independent They seemed clannish too with an unemployed or
freelabour sort of isolation We have an idea that they regarded our
personal appearance with contempt

     

Above Louth we picked up a whaler who came aboard for the sake of
society and tobacco Not that he hoped to shorten his journey he had no
destination He told us many reckless and unprincipled lies and gave
us a few ornamental facts One of them took our fancy and impressed
uswith its beautiful simplicity I suppose He said Some miles
above where the Darlin and the Warrygo runs inter each other theres a
billygong runnin right across between the two rivers and makin a sort
of tryhangular hyland n I can telyer a funny thing about it Here
he paused to light his pipe Now he continued impressively jerking
the match overboard when the Darlins up and the Warrygos LOW
the billygong runs from the Darlin into the WARRYGO AND when the
Warrygos up n the Darlins down the waters runs FROM the Warrygo n
inter the Darlin

What could be more simple

The steamer was engaged to go up a billabong for a load of shearers from
a shed which was cutting out and first it was necessary to tie up in
the river and discharge the greater portion of the cargo in order that
the boat might safely negotiate the shallow waters A local fisherman
who volunteered to act as pilot was taken aboard and after he was
outside about a pint of whisky he seemed to have the greatest confidence
in his ability to take us to hell or anywhere elseat least he said
so A man was sent ashore with blankets and tucker to mind the wool and
we crossed the river butted into the anabranch and started out back
Only the Lord and the pilot know how we got there We travelled over the
bush through its branches sometimes and sometimes through grass and
mud and every now and then we struck something that felt and sounded
like a collision The boat slid down one hill and fetched a stump at
the bottom with a force that made every mothers son bite his tongue or
break a tooth

The shearers came aboard next morning with their swags and two
cartloads of boiled mutton bread brownie and tea and sugar They
numbered about fifty including the rouseabouts This load of sin sank
the steamer deeper into the mud but the passengers crowded over to
port by request of the captain and the crew poked the bank away with
long poles When we began to move the shearers gave a howl like the
yell of a legion of lost souls escaping from down below They gave three
cheers for the rouseabouts cook who stayed behind then they cursed
the station with a mighty curse They cleared a space on deck had
a jig and afterwards a fight between the shearers cook and his
assistant They gave a mighty bush whoop for the Darling when the boat
swung into that grand old gutter and in the evening they had a general
allround time We got back and the crew had to reload the wool without
assistance for it bore the accursed brand of a freedomofcontract
shed

We slept or tried to sleep that night on the ridge of two wool bales
laid with the narrow sides up having first been obliged to get ashore
and fight six rounds with a shearer for the privilege of roosting there
The live cinders from the firebox went up the chimney all night and
fell in showers on deck Every now and again a spark would burn through
the Wagga rug of a sleeping shearer and hed wake suddenly and get up
and curse It was no use shifting round for the wind was all ways
and the boat steered north south east and west to humour the river
Occasionally a low branch would root three or four passengers off their
wool bales and theyd get up and curse in chorus The boat started two
snags and towards daylight struck a stump The accent was on the stump
A wool bale went overboard and took a swag and a dog with it then the
owner of the swag and dog and the crew of the boat had a swearing match
between them The swagman won

About daylight we stretched our cramped limbs extricated one leg from
between the wool bales and found that the steamer was just crayfishing
away from a mud island where she had tied up for more wool Some of the
chaps had been ashore and boiled four or five buckets of tea and coffee
Shortly after the boat had settled down to work again an incident came
along A rouseabout rose late and while the others were at breakfast
got an idea into his head that a good sloosh would freshen him up so
he mooched round until he found a big wooden bucket with a rope to it
He carried the bucket aft of the wheel The boat was butting up stream
for all she was worth and the stream was running the other way of
course and about a hundred times as fast as a train The jackeroo gave
the line a turn round his wrist before anyone could see him in time to
suppress him he lifted the bucket swung it to and fro and dropped it
cleverly into the water

This delayed us for nearly an hour A couple of men jumped into the row
boat immediately and cast her adrift They picked up the jackeroo about
a mile down the river clinging to a snag and when we hauled him aboard
he looked like something the cat had dragged in only bigger We revived
him with rum and got him on his feet and then when the captain and
crew had done cursing him he rubbed his head went forward and had a
look at the paddle then he rubbed his head again thought and remarked
to his mates

Wasnt it lucky I didnt dip that bucket FORARD the wheel

This remark struck us forcibly We agreed that it was luckyfor him
but the captain remarked that it was damned unlucky for the world
which he explained was overpopulated with fools already

Getting on towards afternoon we found a barge loaded with wool and tied
up to a tree in the wilderness There was no sign of a man to be seen
nor any sign except the barge that a human being had ever been there
The captain took the craft in tow towed it about ten miles up the
stream and left it in a less likely place than where it was before

Floating bottles began to be more frequent and we knew by that same
token that we were nearing Heres LuckBourke we mean And this
reminds us

When the Brewarrina people observe a more than ordinary number of
bottles floating down the river they guess that Walgett is on the
spree when the Louth chaps see an unbroken procession of dead marines
for three or four days they know that Bourkes drunk The poor
Godabandoned whaler sits in his hungry camp at sunset and watches the
empty symbols of Hope go by and feels more Godforgotten than everand
thirstier if possibleand gets a great wide thirsty quaking empty
longing to be up where those bottles come from If the townspeople knew
how much misery they caused by their thoughtlessness they would drown
their dead marines or bury them but on no account allow them to go
drifting down the river and stirring up hells in the bosoms of less
fortunate fellowcreatures

There came a man from Adelaide to Bourke once and he collected all the
empty bottles in town stacked them by the river and waited for a boat
What he wanted them for the legend sayeth not but the people reckoned
he had a private still or something of that sort somewhere down the
river and were satisfied What he came from Adelaide for or whether he
really did come from there we do not know All the Darling bunyips are
supposed to come from Adelaide Anyway the man collected all the empty
bottles he could lay his hands on and piled them on the bank where
they made a good show He waited for a boat to take his cargo and
while waiting he got drunk That excited no comment He stayed drunk
for three weeks but the townspeople saw nothing unusual in that In
order to become an object of interest in their eyes and in that line
he would have had to stay drunk for a year and fight three times a
dayoftener if possibleand lie in the road in the broiling
heat between whiles and be walked on by camels and Afghans and
freelabourers and be locked up every time he got sober enough to smash
a policeman and try to hang himself naked and be finally squashed by a
loaded wool team

But while he drank the Darling rose for reasons best known to itself
and floated those bottles off They strung out and started for the
Antarctic Ocean with a big old wickerworked demijohn in the lead

For the first week the downriver men took no notice but after the
bottles had been drifting past with scarcely a break for a fortnight or
so they began to get interested Several whalers watched the procession
until they got the jimjams by force of imagination and when their
bodies began to float down with the bottles the downriver people got
anxious

At last the Mayor of Wilcannia wired Bourke to know whether Dibbs or
Parkes was dead or democracy triumphant or if not wherefore the
jubilation Many telegrams of a like nature were received during that
week and the true explanation was sent in reply to each But it wasnt
believed and to this day Bourke has the name of being the most drunken
town on the river

After dinner a humorous old hard case mysteriously took us aside and
said he had a good yarn which we might be able to work up We asked him
how but he winked a mighty cunning wink and said that he knew all about
us Then he asked us to listen He said

There was an old feller down the Murrumbidgee named Kelly He was a
bit gone here One day Kelly was out lookin for some sheep when he
got lost It was gettin dark Bymeby there came an old crow in a tree
overhead

Kelley youre loost Kelley youre loost sez the crow

I know I am sez Kelly

Foller me foller me sez the crow

Right yare sez Kelly with a jerk of his arm Go ahead

So the crow went on and Kelly follered an bymeby he found he was on
the right track

Sometime after Kelly was washin sheep this was when we useter wash
the sheep instead of the wool Kelly was standin on the platform with
a crutch in his hand landin the sheep when there came a old crow in
the tree overhead

Kelly Im hungry Kelley Im hungerry sez the crow

Alright sez Kelly be up at the hut about dinner time n Ill
sling you out something

Drownasheep Drownasheep Kelley sez the crow

Blanked if I do sez Kelly If I drown a sheep Ill have to pay for
it beGod

Then I wont find yer when yer lost agin sez the crow

Im damned if yer will says Kelly Ill take blanky good care I
wont get lost again to be found by a gory ole crow

     

There are a good many fishermen on the Darling They camp along the
banks in all sorts of tents and move about in little box boats that
will only float one man The fisherman is never heavy He is mostly a
withered little old madman with black claws dirty rags which he never
changes unkempt hair and beard and a ratty expression We cannot
say that we ever saw him catch a fish or even get a bite and we
certainly never saw him offer any for sale

He gets a dozen or so lines out into the stream with the shore end
fastened to pegs or roots on the bank and passed over sticks about four
feet high stuck in the mud on the top of these sticks he hangs bullock
bells or substitutesjam tins with stones fastened inside to bits of
string Then he sits down and waits If the cod pulls the line the bell
rings

The fisherman is a great authority on the river and fish but has
usually forgotten everything else including his name He chops firewood
for the boats sometimes but it isnt his professionhes a fisherman
He is only sane on points concerning the river though he has all the
fishermans eccentricities Of course he is a liar

When he gets his camp fixed on one bank it strikes him he ought to be
over on the other or at a place up round the bend so he shifts Then
he reckons he was a fool for not stopping where he was before He
never dies He never gets older or drier or more withered looking
or dirtier or loonierbecause he cant We cannot imagine him as ever
having been a boy or even a youth We cannot even try to imagine him
as a baby He is an animated mummy who used to fish on the Nile three
thousand years ago and catch nothing

     

We forgot to mention that there are wonderfully few wrecks on the
Darling The river boats seldom go downtheir hulls are not built that
wayand if one did go down it wouldnt sink far But once down a boat
is scarcely ever raised again because you see the mud silts up round
it and over it and glues it as it were to the bottom of the river
Then the fortyfoot alligatorswhich come down with the Queenslan
rains we supposeroot in the mud and fill their bellies with sodden
flour and drowned deckhands

They tried once to blow up a wreck with dynamite because it the
wreck obstructed navigation but they blew the bottom out of the river
instead and all the water went through The Government have been boring
for it ever since I saw some of the bores myselfthere is one at
Coonamble

There is a yarn along the Darling about a cute Yankee who was invited
up to Bourke to report on a proposed scheme for locking the river He
arrived towards the end of a long and severe drought and was met at the
railway station by a deputation of representative bushmen who invited
him in the first place to accompany them to the principal pubwhich
he did He had been observed to study the scenery a good deal while
coming up in the train but kept his conclusions to himself On the way
to the pub he had a look at the town and it was noticed that he tilted
his hat forward very often and scratched the back of his head a
good deal and pondered a lot but he refrained from expressing an
opinioneven when invited to do so He guessed that his opinions
wouldnt do much good anyway and he calculated that they would keep
till he got back over our wayby which it was reckoned he meant the
States

When they asked him what hed have he said to Watty the publican

Wal I reckon you can build me your national drink I guess Ill try
it

A long colonial was drawn for him and he tried it He seemed rather
startled at first then he looked curiously at the halfempty glass
set it down very softly on the bar and leaned against the same and
fell into a reverie from which he roused himself after a while with a
sorrowful jerk of his head

Ah well he said Show me this river of yourn

They led him to the Darling and he had a look at it

Is this your river he asked

Yes they replied apprehensively

He tilted his hat forward till the brim nearly touched his nose
scratched the back of his long neck shut one eye and looked at the
river with the other Then after spitting half a pint of tobacco juice
into the stream he turned sadly on his heel and led the way back to the
pub He invited the boys to pisen themselves after they were served
he ordered out the longest tumbler on the premises poured a drop into
it from nearly every bottle on the shelf added a lump of ice and drank
slowly and steadily

Then he took pity on the impatient and anxious population opened his
mouth and spake

Look here fellows he drawled jerking his arm in the direction of
the river Ill tell you what Ill dew Ill bottle that damned river
of yourn in twentyfour hours

Later on he mellowed a bit under the influence of several drinks which
were carefully and conscientiously built from plans and specifications
supplied by himself and then among other things he said

If that there river rises as high as you say it dewand if this was
the Stateswhy wed have had the Great Eastern up here twenty years
agoor words to that effect

Then he added reflectively

When I come over here I calculated that I was going to make things
hum but now I guess Ill have to change my prospectus Theres a lot of
loose energy laying round over our way but I guess that if I wanted
to make things move in your country Id have to bring over the entire
American nationalso his wife and dawg Youve got the makings of a
glorious nation over here but you dont get up early enough

     

The only national work performed by the blacks is on the Darling They
threw a dam of rocks across the rivernear Brewarrina we thinkto
make a fish trap Its there yet But God only knows where they got the
stones from or how they carried them for there isnt a pebble within
forty miles




A Case for the Oracle



The Oracle and I were camped together The Oracle was a bricklayer by
trade and had two or three small contracts on hand I was doing a
bit of housepainting There were a plasterer a carpenter and a
plumberwe were all Tothersiders and old mates and we worked
things together It was in Westraliathe Land of Tothersidersand
therefore we were not surprised when Mitchell turned up early one
morning with his swag and an atmosphere of salt water about him

Hed had a rough trip he said and would take a spell that day and take
the lay of the land and have something cooked for us by the time we came
home and go to graft himself next morning And next morning he went to
work labouring for the Oracle

The Oracle and his mates being small contractors and not pressed for
time had dispensed with the services of a labourer and had done their
own mixing and hodcarrying in turns They didnt want a labourer now
but the Oracle was a vague fatalist and Mitchell a decided one So it
passed

The Oracle had a Case right under his nosein his own employ in
fact but was not aware of the fact until Mitchell drew his attention
to it The Case went by the name of Alfred OBriarwhich hinted a mixed
parentage He was a small nervous workingman of no particular colour
and no decided character apparently If he had a soul above bricks he
never betrayed it He was not popular on the jobs There was something
sly about Alf they said

The Oracle had taken him on in the first place as a daylabourer
but afterwards shared the pay with him as with Mitchell OBriar
shoutedjudiciously but on every possible occasionfor the Oracle
and as he was an indifferent workman the boys said he only did this so
that the Oracle might keep him on If OBriar took things easy and did
no more than the rest of us at least one of us would be sure to get it
into his head that he was loafing on us and if he grafted harder than
we did wed be sure to feel indignant about that too and reckon that
it was done out of nastiness or crawlsomeness and feel a contempt for
him accordingly We found out accidentally that OBriar was an excellent
mimic and a bit of a ventriloquist but he never entertained us with his
peculiar gifts and we set that down to churlishness

OBriar kept his own counsel and his history if he had one and hid
his hopes joys and sorrows if he had any behind a vacant grin
as Mitchell hid his behind a quizzical one He never resented alleged
satireperhaps he couldnt see itand therefore he got the name of
being a cur As a rule he was careful with his money and was called
meannot however by the Oracle whose philosophy was simple and
whose sympathy could not realise a limit nor yet by Mitchell Mitchell
waited

     

OBriar occupied a small tent by himself and lived privately of
evenings When we began to hear two men talking at night in his tent
we were rather surprised and wondered in a vague kind of way how any of
the chaps could take sufficient interest in Alf to go in and yarn with
him In the days when he was supposed to be sociable we had voted him a
bore even the Oracle was moved to admit that he was a bit slow

But late one night we distinctly heard a womans voice in OBriars
tent The Oracle suddenly became hard of hearing and though we heard
the voice on several occasions he remained exasperatingly deaf yet
aggressively unconscious of the fact I have got enough to do puzzling
over me own whys and wherefores he said Mitchell began to take some
interest in OBriar and treated him with greater respect But our camp
had the name of being the bestconstructed the cleanest and the most
respectable in the vicinity The health officer and constable in charge
had complimented us on the fact and we were proud of it And there were
three young married couples in camp also a Darby and Joan therefore
when the voice of a woman began to be heard frequently and at
disreputable hours of the night in OBriars tent we got uneasy about
it And when the constable who was on night duty gave us a friendly
hint Mitchell and I agreed that something must be done

Av coorse men will be men said the constable as he turned his
horses head but I thought Id mention it OBriar is a dacent man
and hes one of yer mates Av coorse Theres a bad lot in that camp in
the scrub over yander andav coorse Goodday to ye byes

     

Next night we heard the voice in OBriars tent again and decided to
speak to Alf in a friendly way about it in the morning We listened
outside in the dark but could not distinguish the words though I
thought I recognised the voice

Its the hussy from the camp over there shes got holt of that fool
and shell clean him out before shes done I said Were Alfs mates
any way it goes and we ought to put a stop to it

What hussy asked Mitchell theres three or four there

The one with her hair all over her head I answered

Where else should it be asked Mitchell But Ill just have a peep
and see who it is Theres no harm in that

He crept up to the tent and cautiously moved the flap Alfs candle was
alight he lay on his back in his bunk with his arms under his head
calmly smoking We withdrew

They must have heard us said Mitchell and shes slipped out under
the tent at the back and through the fence into the scrub

Mitchells respect for Alf increased visibly

But we began to hear ominous whispers from the young married couples
and next Saturday night which was paynight we decided to see it
through We did not care to speak to Alf until we were sure He stayed
in camp as he often did on Saturday evening while the others went
up town Mitchell and I returned earlier than usual and leaned on the
fence at the back of Alfs tent

We were scarcely there when we were startled by a rattattat as of
someone knocking at a door Then an old womans voice INSIDE the tent
asked Whos there

Its me said Alfs voice from the front Mr OBriar from Perth

Mary go and open the door said the old woman Mitchell nudged me to
keep quiet

Come in Mr OBreer said the old woman Come in How do you do
When did you get back

Only last night said Alf

Look at that now Bless us all And how did you like the country at
all

I didnt care much for it said Alf We lost the thread of it until
the old woman spoke again

Have you had your tea Mr OBreer

Yes thank you Mrs OConnor

Are you quite sure man

Quite sure thank you Mrs OConnor Mitchell trod on my foot

Will you have a drop of whisky or a glass of beer Mr OBreer

Ill take a glass of beer thank you Mrs OConnor

There seemed to be a long pause Then the old woman said Ah well I
must get my work done and Mary will stop here and keep you company Mr
OBreer The arrangement seemed satisfactory to all parties for there
was nothing more said for a while Mitchell nudged me again with
emphasis and I kicked his shin

Presently Alf said Mary And a girls voice said Yes Alf

You remember the night I went away Mary

Yes Alf I do

I have travelled long ways since then Mary I worked hard and lived
close I didnt make my fortune but I managed to rub a note or two
together It was a hard time and a lonesome time for me Mary The
summers awful over there and livins bad and dear You couldnt have
any idea of it Mary

No Alf

I didnt come back so well off as I expected

But that doesnt matter Alf

I got heartsick and tired of it and couldnt stand it any longer
Mary

But thats all over now Alf you mustnt think of it

Your mother wrote to me

I know she didvery low and gently

And do you know what she put in it Mary

Yes Alf

And did you ask her to put it in

Dont ask me Alf

And its all true Mary

There was no answer but the silence seemed satisfactory

And be sure you have yourself down here on Sunday Alf me son
Theres the old woman come back said Mitchell

An since the girls willin to have ye and the ould womans
willintheres me hand on it Alf me boy An God bless ye both
The old mans come now said Mitchell

     

Come along said Mitchell leading the way to the front of the tent

But I wouldnt like to intrude on them Its hardly right Mitchell is
it

Thats all right said Mitchell He tapped the tent pole

Come in said Alf Alf was lying on his bunk as before with his arms
under his head His face wore a cheerful not to say happy expression
There was no one else in the tent I was never more surprised in my
life

Have you got the paper Alf said Mitchell

Yes Youll find it there at the foot of the bunk There it is Wont
you sit down Mitchell

Not tonight said Mitchell We brought you a bottle of ale Were
just going to turn in

And we said goodnight Well I said to Mitchell when we got inside
what do you think of it

I dont think of it at all said Mitchell Do you mean to say you
cant see it now

No Im dashed if I can I said Some of us must be drunk I think
or getting rats Its not to be wondered at and the sooner we get out
of this country the better

Well you must be a fool Joe said Mitchell Cant you see ALF
THINKS ALOUD

WHAT

Talks to himself He was thinking about going back to his sweetheart
Dont you know hes a bit of a ventriloquist

Mitchell lay awake a long time in the position that Alf usually lay in
and thought Perhaps he thought on the same lines as Alf did that night
But Mitchell did his thinking in silence

We thought it best to tell the Oracle quietly He was deeply interested
but not surprised Ive heerd of such cases before he said But the
Oracle was a gentleman Theres things that a man wants to keep to
himself that aint his business he said And we understood this remark
to be intended for our benefit and to indicate a course of action upon
which the Oracle had decided with respect to this case and which we
in his opinion should do well to follow

Alf got away a week or so later and we all took a holiday and went down
to Fremantle to see him off Perhaps he wondered why Mitchell gripped
his hand so hard and wished him luck so earnestly and was surprised
when he gave him three cheers

Ah well remarked Mitchell as we turned up the wharf

Ive heerd of such cases before said the Oracle meditatively They
aint common but Ive heard of such cases before




A Daughter of Maoriland

 A sketch of poorclass Maoris



The new nativeschool teacher who was green soft and poetical
and had a literary ambition called her August and fondly hoped to
build a romance on her character She was down in the school registers
as Sarah Moses Maori 16 years and three months She looked twenty but
this was nothing insomuch as the mother of the youngest child in the
schoola dear little halfcaste lady of two or three summershad not
herself the vaguest idea of the childs age nor anybody elses nor
of ages in the abstract The church register was lost some six years
before when Granny who was a hundred if a day was supposed to
be about twentyfive The teacher had to guess the ages of all the new
pupils

August was apparently the oldest in the schoola big ungainly awkward
girl with a heavy negro type of Maori countenance and about as much
animation mentally or physically as a cow She was given to brooding
in fact she brooded all the time She brooded all day over her school
work but did it fairly well How the previous teachers had taught her
all she knew was a mystery to the new one There had been a tragedy in
Augusts family when she was a child and the affair seemed to have cast
a gloom over the lives of the entire family for the lowering brooding
cloud was on all their faces August would take to the bush when things
went wrong at home and climb a tree and brood till she was found and
coaxed home Things according to pa gossip had gone wrong with her
from the date of the tragedy when she a bright little girl was
takena homeless orphanto live with a sister and afterwards with
an auntbymarriage They treated her twas said with a brutality
which must have been greatly exaggerated by pagossip seeing
that unkindness of this description is according to all the best
authorities altogether foreign to Maori nature

Pagossipwhich is less reliable than the ordinary washerwoman kind
because of a deeper and more vicious ignorancehad it that one time
when August was punished by a teacher or beaten by her sister or
auntbymarriage she took to the bush for three days at the
expiration of which time she was found on the ground in an exhausted
condition She was evidently a true Maori or savage and this was one of
the reasons why the teacher with the literary ambition took an interest
in her She had a print of a portrait of a man in soldiers uniform
taken from a copy of the Illustrated London News pasted over the
fireplace in the whare where she lived and neatly bordered by vandyked
strips of silvered teapaper She had pasted it in the place of honour
or as near as she could get to it The place of honour was sacred
to framed representations of the Nativity and Catholic subjects
halfmodelled halfpictured The print was a portrait of the last Czar
of Russia of all the men in the world and August was reported to have
said that she loved that man His father had been murdered so had her
mother This was one of the reasons why the teacher with the literary
ambition thought he could get a romance out of her

After the first week she hung round the new schoolmistress
doglikewith doglike affection thought the teacher She came down
often during the holidays and hung about the verandah and back door for
an hour or so then byandbye shed be gone Her brooding seemed
less aggressive on such occasions The teacher reckoned that she had
something on her mind and wanted to open her heart to the wife but
was too ignorant or too shy poor girl and he reckoned from his theory
of Maori character that it might take her weeks or months to come to
the point One day after a great deal of encouragement she explained
that she felt so awfully lonely Mrs Lorrens All the other girls
were away and she wished it was schooltime

She was happy and cheerful again in her brooding way in the
playground There was something sadly ludicrous about her great
ungainly figure slopping round above the children at play The
schoolmistress took her into the parlour gave her tea and cake and was
kind to her and she took it all with broody cheerfulness

One Sunday morning she came down to the cottage and sat on the edge of
the verandah looking as wretchedly miserable as a girl could She was
in ragsat least she had a rag of a dress onand was barefooted and
bareheaded She said that her aunt had turned her out and she was going
to walk down the coast to Whale Bay to her grandmothera long days
ride The teacher was troubled because he was undecided what to do
He had to be careful to avoid any unpleasantness arising out of Maori
cliquism As the teacher he couldnt let her go in the state she was in
from the depths of his greenness he trusted her from the depths of
his softness he pitied her his poetic nature was fiercely indignant on
account of the poor girls wrongs and the wife spoke for her Then he
thought of his unwritten romance and regarded August in the light of
copy and that settled it While he talked the matter over with his
wife August hid in the dark of her hair awaiting her doom The
teacher put his hat on walked up to the pa and saw her aunt She
denied that she had turned August out but the teacher believed
the girl He explained his position in words simplified for Maori
comprehension and the aunt and relations said they understood and that
he was perfectly right Mr Lorrens They were very respectful The
teacher said that if August would not return home he was willing to let
her stay at the cottage until such time as her uncle who was absent
returned and he the teacher could talk the matter over with him The
relations thought that that was the very best thing that could be done
and thanked him The aunt two sisters and as many of the others
including the children as were within sight or hail at the timemost
of them could not by any possible means have had the slightest
connection with the business in handaccompanied the teacher to the
cottage August took to the flax directly she caught sight of her
relations and was with difficulty induced to return There was a lot
of talk in Maori during which the girl and her aunt shuffled and swung
round at the back of each other and each talked over her shoulder and
laughed foolishly and awkwardly once or twice but in the end the girl
was sullenly determined not to return home so it was decided that she
should stay The schoolmistress made tea

August brightened from the first day She was a different girl
altogether I never saw such a change in a girl said the young
schoolmistress and one or two others I always thought she was a
good girl if taken the right way all she wanted was a change and kind
treatment But the stolid old Maori chairman of the school committee
only shrugged his shoulders and said when the schoolmistress
womanlike pressed him for an opinion to agree with her own You can
look at it two ways Mrs Lorrens Which by the way was about the
only expression of opinion that the teacher was ever able to get out of
him on any subject

August worked and behaved well She was wonderfully quick in picking up
English ways and housework True she was awkward and not over cleanly
in some things but her mistress had patience with her Who wouldnt
have She couldnt do enough for her benefactress she hung on her
words and sat at her footstool of evenings in a way that gladdened the
teachers sentimental nature she couldnt bear to see him help his wife
with a hatpin or buttonAugust must do it She insisted on doing her
mistress hair every night In short she tried in every way to show her
gratitude The teacher and his wife smiled brightly at each other behind
her back and thought how cheerful the house was since she came and
wondered what theyd do without her It was a settled thing that they
should take her back to the city with them and have a faithful and
grateful retainer all their lives and a sort of Aunt Chloe for their
children when they had any The teacher got yards of copy out of her
for his Maori Sketches and Characters worked joyously at his romance
and felt great already and was happy She had a bed made up temporarily
until the teacher could get a spring mattress for her from town on the
floor in the diningroom and when shed made her bed shed squat on it
in front of the fire and sing Maori songs in a soft voice Shed sing
the teacher and his wife in the next room to sleep Then shed get up
and have a feed but they never heard her

Her manners at the table for she was treated like one of themselves
in the broadest sense of the term were surprisingly good considering
that the adults of her people were decidedly cowlike in white society
and scoffed seaeggs shellfish and muttonbirds at home with a gallop
which was not edifying Her appetite it was true was painful at times
to the poetic side of the teachers nature but he supposed that shed
been halfstarved at home poor girl and would get over it Anyway the
copy hed get out of her would repay him for this and other expenses a
hundredfold Moreover begging and borrowing had ceased with her advent
and the teacher set this down to her influence

The first jar came when she was sent on horseback to the town for
groceries and didnt get back till late the next day She explained
that some of her relations got hold of her and made her stay and wanted
her to go into publichouses with them but she wouldnt She said that
SHE wanted to come home But why didnt she The teacher let it pass
and hoped shed gain strength of character byandbye He had waited up
late the night before with her supper on the hob and he and his wife
had been anxious for fear something had happened to the poor girl
who was under their care He had walked to the treacherous riverford
several times during the evening and waited there for her So perhaps
he was tired and that was why he didnt write next night

The sugarbag the onionbasket the potatobag and the teachest began
to go down alarmingly and an occasional pound of candles a pigeon
a muttonbird plucked and ready for Sundays cooking and other little
trifles went also August couldnt understand it and the teacher
believed her for falsehood and deceit are foreign to the simple natures
of the modern Maoris There were no cats but no score of ordinary cats
could have given colour to the cat theory had it been raised in this
case The breath of August advertised onions more than once but no
human stomach could have accounted for the quantity She surely could
not have eaten the other things rawand she had no opportunities for
private cooking as far as the teacher and his wife could see The other
Maoris were out of the question they were all strictly honest

Thefts and annoyances of the above description were credited to the
swaggies who infested the roads and had a very bad name down that
way so the teacher loaded his gun and told August to rouse him at
once if she heard a sound in the night She said she would but a
heavyweight swaggie could have come in and sat on her and had a smoke
without waking her

She couldnt be trusted to go a message Shed take from three to six
hours and come back with an excuse that sounded genuine from its very
simplicity Another sister of hers lay ill in an isolated hut alone and
uncared for except by the teachers wife and occasionally by a poor pa
outcast who had negro blood in her veins and a love for a white loafer
God help her All of which sounds strange considering that Maoris are
very kind to each other The schoolmistress sent August one night to
stay with the sick Maori woman and help her as she could and gave her
strict instructions to come to the cottage first thing in the morning
and tell her how the sick woman was August turned up at lunchtime next
day The teacher gave her her first lecture and said plainly that he
wasnt to be taken for a fool then he stepped aside to get cool and
when he returned the girl was sobbing as if her heart would break and
the wife comforting her She had been up all night poor girl and was
thoroughly worn out Somehow the teacher didnt feel uncomfortable about
it He went down to the whare August had not touched a dishcloth or
broom She had slept as she always did like a pig all night while
her sister lay and tossed in agony in the morning she ate everything
there was to eat in the house which it seemed was the Maori way of
showing sympathy in sickness and trouble after which she brooded
by the fire till the children running out of school announced the
teachers lunch hour

August braced up again for a little while The master thought of the
trouble they had with Ayacanora in Westward Ho and was comforted and
tackled his romance again Then the schoolmistress fell sick and things
went wrong The groceries went down faster than ever and the house got
very dirty and began to have a native smell about it August grew fat
and lazy and dirty and less reliable on washingdays or when there
was anything special to do in the house The savage blood is strong
thought the teacher and she is beginning to long for her own people
and free unconventional life One morningon a washingday too as it
happenedshe called out before the teacher and his wife were up that
the Maoris who supplied them with milk were away and she had promised
to go up and milk the cow and bring the milk down The teacher gave her
permission One of the scholars usually brought the milk early Lunch
time came and no August no milkstrangest of all only half the school
children The teacher put on his hat and went up to the pa once more
He found August squatted in the midst of a circle of relations She was
entertaining them with one of a series of idealistic sketches of the
teachers domestic life in which she showed a very vivid imagination
and exhibited an unaccountable savage sort of pessimism Her intervals
of absence had been occupied in this way from the first The astounding
slanders she had circulated concerning the teachers private life came
back bit by bit to his ears for a year afterwards and her character
sketches of previous teachers and her own relationsfor she spared
nobodywould have earned a white woman a long and wellmerited term of
imprisonment for criminal libel She had cunningly by straightforward
and unscrupulous lying prejudiced the principal mother and boss woman
of the pa against the teacher and his wife as a natural result of which
the old lady who like the rest was very ignorant and ungrateful
turned nasty and kept the children from school The teacher lost
his temper so the children were rounded up and hurried down to
school immediately with them came August and her aunt with alleged
explanations and excuses and a shellfish The aunt and sisters said
theyd have nothing to do with August They didnt want her and wouldnt
have her The teacher said that under those circumstances shed better
go and drown herself so she went home with them

The whole business had been a plot by her nearest relations They
got rid of the trouble and expense of keeping her and the bother of
borrowing in person whenever in need of trifles in the grocery line
Borrowing recommenced with her dismissal but the teacher put a full
stop to it as far as he was concerned Then August egged on by her
aunt sent a blackguardly letter to the teachers wife the sick sister
by the way who had been nursed and supplied with food by her all along
was in it and said she was glad August sent the letter and it served
the schoolmistress right The teacher went up to the pa once more an
hour later August in person accompanied as usual by a relation
or two delivered at the cottage an abject apology in writing the
composition of which would have discouraged the most enthusiastic
advocate of higher education for the lower classes

Then various petty annoyances were tried The teacher is firmly
convinced that certain animallike sounds round the house at night were
due to Augusts trying to find out whether his wife was as likely to be
haunted as the Maoris were He didnt dream of such a thing at the time
for he did not believe that one of them had the pluck to venture out
after dark But savage superstition must give way to savage hate
The girls last tryon was to come down to the school fence and
ostentatiously sharpen a tableknife on the wires while she scowled
murderously in the direction of the schoolmistress who was hanging out
her washing August looked in her dark bushy Maori hair a thoroughly
wild savage Her father had murdered her mother under particularly
brutal circumstances and the daughter took after her father

The teacher called her and said Now look here my lady the best
thing you can do is to drop that nonsense at once she had dropped the
knife in the ferns behind her for were the wrong sort of people
to try it on with Now you get out of this and tell your auntshes
sneaking there in the flaxwhat I tell you and that shed better clear
out of this quick or Ill have a policeman out and take the whole
gang into town in an hour Now be off and shut that gate behind you
carefully and fasten it She did and went

The worst of it was that the August romance copy was useless Her lies
were even less reliable and picturesque than the common Jones Alley hag
lie Then the teacher thought of the soft fool hed been and that made
him wild He looked like a fool and was one to a great extent but it
wasnt good policy to take him for one

Strange to say he and others had reason to believe that August
respected him and liked him rather than otherwise but she hated his
wife who had been kind to her as only a savage can hate The younger
pupils told the teacher cheerfully and confidently that August said
shed cut Mrs Lorrens throat the first chance she got Next week the
aunt sent down to ask if the teacher could sell her a bar of soap and
sent the same old shilling he was tired of seeing it stuck out in front
of him so he took it put it in his pocket and sent the soap This
must have discouraged them for the borrowing industry petered out He
saw the aunt later on and she told him cheerfully that August was
going to live with a halfcaste in a certain house in town

Poor August For she was only a tool after all Her romance was
briefly as followsShe went per offhand Maori arrangement as
housekeeper in the hut of a labourer at a neighbouring sawmill She
stayed three months for a wonder at the expiration of which time she
put on her hat and explained that she was tired of stopping there and
was going home He said All right Sarah wait a while and Ill take
you home At the door of her aunts house he said Well goodbye
Sarah and she said in her brooding way Goodbye Jim And that was
all

As the last apparent result of Augusts mischiefmaking her brother
or someone one evening rode up to the cottage drunk and inclined to
bluster He was accompanied by a friend also drunk who came to see the
fun and was ready to use his influence on the winning side The teacher
went inside brought out his gun and slipped two cartridges in
Ive had enough of this he said Now then be off you insolent
blackguards or Ill shoot you like rabbits Go and he snapped his jaw
and the breech of his gun together As they rode off the old local hawk
happened to soar close over a dead lamb in the fern at the corner of the
garden and the teacher who had been laying for him a long time let
fly both barrels at him without thinking When he turned there was
only a cloud of dust down the track

     

The teacher taught that school for three years thereafter without a
hitch But he went no more on Universal Brotherhood lines And for
years after he had gone his name was spoken of with great respect by
the Maoris




New Years Night



It was dark enough for anything in Dead Mans Gapa round warm close
darkness in which retreating sounds seemed to be cut off suddenly at a
distance of a hundred yards or so instead of growing faint and fainter
and dying away to strike the ear once or twice againand after
minutes it might seemwith startling distinctness before being
finally lost in the distance as it is on clear frosty nights So with
the sounds of horses hoofs stumbling on the rough bridletrack through
the saddle the clatter of hoofclipped stones and scrape of gravel
down the hidden siding and the low sound of mens voices blurred
and speaking in monosyllables and at intervals it seemed and in hushed
awed tones as though they carried a corpse To practical eyes grown
used to such a darkness and at the nearest point the passing blurrs
would have suggested two riders on bush hacks leading a third with an
empty saddle on its backa ladys or sidesaddle if one could have
distinguished the horns They may have struck a soft track or level or
rounded the buttress of the hill higher up but before they had time
to reach or round the foot of the spur blurs whispers stumble and
clatter of hoofs jingle of bridle rings and the occasional clank
together of stirrup irons seemed shut off as suddenly and completely as
though a great soundproof door had swung to behind them

It was dark enough on the glaringest of days down in the lonely hollow
or pocket between two spurs at the head of a blind gully behind
Mount Buckaroo where there was a more or less dusty patch barely
defined even in broad daylight by a spidery doglegged fence on
three sides and a thin tworail dignified with the adjective
splitrailthough rails and posts were mostly of saplings split in
halves running along the frontage In about the middle of it a little
slab hut overshadowed by a big stringybark shed was pointed out as
Johnny Mearss Farm

Black asas charcoal said Johnny Mears He had never seen coal and
was a cautious man whose ideas came slowly He stooped close by the
fence with his hands on his knees to sky the loom of his big shed
and so get his bearings He had been to have a look at the penned
calves and see that all sliprails were up and pegged for the words of
John Mears junior especially when delivered rapidly and shrilly and in
injured tones were not to be relied upon in these matters

Its hot enough to melt the belly out of my fiddle said Johnny Mears
to his wife who sat on a threelegged stool by the rough table in the
little whitewashed endroom putting a patch of patches over the seat
of a pair of moleskin knickerbockers He lit his pipe moved a stool
to the side of the great empty fireplace where it looked coolermight
have been cooler on account of a possible draught suggested by the
presence of the chimney and where therefore he felt a breath
cooler He took his fiddle from a convenient shelf tuned it slowly and
carefully holding his pipe in his mouth well up and to one side as
if the fiddle were an inquisitive and restless baby He played Little
Drops o Brandy three times right through without variations
blinking solemnly the while then he put the violin carefully back in
its box and started to cut up another pipeful

You should have gone Johnny said the haggard little woman

Rackin the horse out a night like this retorted Johnny and
startin ploughin tomorrow It aint worth while Let them come for me
if they want me Dance on a night like this Why theyll dance in

But you promised It wont do you no good Johnny

It wont do me no harm

The little woman went on stitching

Its smotherin hot said Johnny with an impatient oath I dont
know whether Ill turn in or turn out under the shed tonight Its
too dd hot to roost indoors

She bent her head lower over the patch One smoked and the other
stitched in silence for twenty minutes or so during which time Johnny
might be supposed to have been deliberating listlessly as to whether
hed camp out on account of the heat or turn in But he broke the
silence with a clout at a mosquito on the nape of his neck and a bad
word

I wish you wouldnt swear so much Johnny she said wearilyat least
not tonight

He looked at her blankly

Whywhy tonight Whats the matter with you tonight Mary Whats
tonight more than any other night to you I see no harmcant a man
swear when a mosquito sticks him

II was only thinking of the boys Johnny

The boys Why theyre both on the hay in the shed He stared at
her again shifted uneasily crossed the other leg tightly frowned
blinked and reached for the matches You look a bit offcolour Mary
Its the heat that makes us all a bit ratty at times Better put that by
and have a swill o oatmeal and water and turn in

Its too hot to go to bed I couldnt sleep Im all right IllIll
just finish this Just reach me a drink from the waterbagthe
pannikins on the hob there by your boot

He scratched his head helplessly and reached for the drink When he
sat down again he felt strangely restless Like a hen that didnt know
where to lay he put it He couldnt settle down or keep still and
didnt seem to enjoy his pipe somehow He rubbed his head again

Theres a thunderstorm comin he said Thats what it is and the
sooner it comes the better

He went to the back door and stared at the blackness to the east and
sure enough lightning was blinking there

Its coming sure enough just hang out and keep cool for another hour
and youll feel the difference

He sat down again on the threelegged stool folded his arms with his
elbows on his knees drew a long breath and blinked at the clay floor
for a while then he twisted the stool round on one leg until he faced
the oldfashioned spired wooden clock the brass disc of the pendulum
moving ghostlike through a scarred and scratched marine sceneMargate
in Englandon the glass that covered the lower half that stood alone
on the slab shelf over the fireplace The hands indicated halfpast
two and Johnny who had studied that clock and could hit the time nigh
enough by it after knitting his brows and blinking at the dial for a
full minute by its own hand decided that it must be getting on toward
nine oclock

It must have been the heat Johnny stood up raking his hair turned to
the door and back again and then after an impatient gesture took up
his fiddle and raised it to his shoulder Then the queer thing happened
He said afterwards under conditions favourable to such sentimental
confidence that a cold hand seemed to take hold of the bow through
his andanyway before he knew what he was about he had played the
first bars of When First I Met Sweet Peggy a tune he had played
often twenty years before in his courting days and had never happened
to play since He sawed it right through the cold hand left after the
first bar or two standing up then still stood with fiddle and bow
trembling in his hands with the queer feeling still on him and a
rush of old thoughts going through his head all of which he set down
afterwards to the effect of the heat He put the fiddle away hastily
damning the bridge of it at the same time in loud but hurried tones
with the idea of covering any eccentricity which the wife might have
noticed in his actions Must a got a touch o sun he muttered
to himself He sat down fumbled with knife pipe and tobacco and
presently stole a furtive glance over his shoulder at his wife

The washedout little woman was still sewing but stitching blindly for
great tears were rolling down her worn cheeks

Johnny whitefaced on account of the heat stood close behind her
one hand on her shoulder and the other clenched on the table but the
clenched hand shook as badly as the loose one

Good God What is the matter Mary Youre sick They had had little
or no experience of illness Tell me Marycome now Has the boys
been up to anything

No Johnny its not that

What is it then Youre taken sick What have you been doing with
yourself It might be fever Hold up a minute You wait here quiet while
I roost out the boys and send em for the doctor and someone

No no Im not sick John Its only a turn Ill be all right in a
minute

He shifted his hand to her head which she dropped suddenly with a
lifeweary sigh against his side

Now then cried Johnny wildly dont you faint or go into
disterricks Mary Itll upset the boys think of the boys Its only
the heatyoure only takin queer

Its not that you ought to know me better than that It
wasIJohnny I was only thinkingweve been married twenty years
tonightanits New Years Night

And Ive never thought of it said Johnny in the afterwards Shows
what a Godforgotten selection will make of a man Shed thought of it
all the time and was waiting for it to strike me Why Id agreed to go
and play at a darnce at Old Pipeclay Schoolhouse all nightthat very
nightand leave her at home because she hadnt asked to come and
it never struck me to ask herat home by herself in that holefor
twentyfive bob And I only stopped at home because Id got the hump
and knew theyd want me bad at the school

They sat close together on the long stool by the table shy and awkward
at first and she clung to him at opening of thunder and they started
apart guiltily when the first great drops sounded like footsteps on the
gravel outside just as theyd done one nighttime beforetwenty years
before

If it was dark before it was black now The edge of the awful
stormcloud rushed up and under the original darkness like the best
drop blackbrushed over the cheap lamp variety turning it grey by
contrast The deluge lasted only a quarter of an hour but it cleared
the night and did its work There was hail before it toobig as emu
eggs the boys saidthat lay feet deep in the old diggers holes on
Pipeclay for days afterwardsweeks some said

The two sweethearts of twenty years ago and tonight watched the retreat
of the storm and seeing Mount Buckaroo standing clear they went to
the back door which opened opposite the end of the shed and saw to the
east a glorious arch of steelblue starry sky with the distant peaks
showing clear and blue away back under the faraway stars in the depth
of it

They lingered awhilearms round each others waistsbefore she called
the boys just as they had done this time of night twenty years ago
after the boys grandmother had called her

Awlright mother bawled back the boys with unfilial independence
of Australian youth Were awlright Well be in directly Wasnt it a
pelterer mother

They went in and sat down again The embarrassment began to wear off

Well get out of this Mary said Johnny Ill take Masons offer
for the cattle and things and take that job of Dawsons boss or no
bossJohnnys bad luck was due to his inability in the past to get
on with any boss for any reasonable length of timeI can get the
boys on too Theyre doing no good here and growing up It aint doing
justice to them and whats more this life is killin you Mary That
settles it I was blind Let the jumptup selection go Its making a
walleyed bullock of me Marya dryrotted rag of a walleyed bullock
like Jimmy Nowletts old Strawberry And youll live in town like a
lady

Somebody coming yelled the boys

There was a clatter of sliprails hurriedly thrown down and clipped by
horses hoofs

Black Joe



They called him Black Joe and me White Joe by way of distinction and
for the convenience of his boss my uncle and my aunt and mother so
when we heard the cry of Blaaack Joe the adjective drawn out until
it became a screech after several repetitions and the Joe short
and sharp coming across the flat in a womans voice Joe knew that the
missus wanted him at the house to get wood or water or mind the baby
and he kept carefully out of sight he went at once when uncle called
And when we heard the cry of Whiite Joe which we did with
difficulty and after several triesthough Black Joes ears were of the
keenestwe knew that I was overdue at home or absent without leave
and was probably in for a warming as the old folk called it On some
occasions I postponed the warming as long as my stomach held out which
was a good while in fivecorner nativecherry or yam seasonbut the
warming was none the cooler for being postponed

Sometimes Joe heard the wrong adjective or led me to believe he
didand left me for a whole afternoon under the impression that the
race of Ham was in demand at the homestead when I myself was wanted
there and maternal wrath was increasing every moment of my absence

But Joe knew that my conscience was not so elastic as his andwell
you must expect little things like this in all friendships

Black Joe was somewhere between nine and twelve when I first met him
on a visit to my uncles station I was somewhere in those years too
He was very black the darker for being engaged in the interesting but
uncertain occupation of burning off in his spare timewhich wasnt
particularly limited He combined shepherding possum and kangaroo
hunting crawfishing sleeping and various other occupations and
engagements with that of burning off I was very white being a sickly
town boy but as I took great interest in burning off and was not
particularly fond of cold waterit was in winter timethe difference
in our complexions was not so marked at times

Black Joes father old Black Jimmie lived in a gunyah on the rise
at the back of the sheepyards and shepherded for my uncle He was a
gentle goodhumoured easygoing old fellow with a pleasant smile
which description applies I think to most old blackfellows in
civilisation I was very partial to the old man and chummy with him
and used to slip away from the homestead whenever I could and squat
by the campfire along with the other piccaninnies and think and
yarn socially with Black Jimmie by the hour I would give something to
remember those conversations now Sometimes somebody would be sent to
bring me home when it got too late and Black Jimmie would say

Piccaninnie alonga possum rug and there Id be sound asleep with
the other young Australians

I liked Black Jimmie very much and would willingly have adopted him
as a father I should have been quite content to spend my days in the
scrub enjoying life in dark and savage ways and my nights alonga
possum rug but the family had other plans for my future

It was a case of two blackfellows and one gin when Black Jimmie went
awooingabout twelve years before I made his acquaintanceand he
fought for his bride in the black fashion It was the last affair of
that kind in the district My uncles brother professed to have been
present at the fight and gave me an alleged description of it He said
that they drew lots and Black Jimmie put his hands on his knees and
bent his head and the other blackfellow hit him a whack on the skull
with a nulla nulla Then they had a nip of rum all roundBlack Jimmie
must have wanted it for the nulla nulla was knotted and heavy and
made in the most approved fashion Then the other blackfellow bent his
head and Jimmie took the club and returned the whack with interest
Then the other fellow hit Jimmie a lick and took a clout in return
Then they had another drink and continued thus until Jimmies rival
lost all heart and interest in the business But you couldnt take
everything my uncles brother said for granted

Black Mary was a queen by right and had the reputation of being
the cleanest gin in the district she was a great favourite with the
squatters wives round there Perhaps she hoped to reclaim Jimmiehe
was royal too but held easy views with regard to religion and the
conventionalities of civilisation Mary insisted on being married
properly by a clergyman made the old man build a decent hut had all
her children christened and kept him and them clean and tidy up to the
time of her death

Poor Queen Mary was ambitious She started to educate her children
and when they got beyond herthat is when they had learnt their
lettersshe was grateful for any assistance from the goodnatured bush
men and women of her acquaintance She had decided to get her eldest boy
into the mounted police and had plans for the rest and she worked hard
for them too Jimmie offered no opposition and gave her no assistance
beyond the rations and money he earned shepherdingwhich was as much as
could be expected of him

He did as many husbands do for the sake of peace and quietnesshe
drifted along in the wake of his wife and took things as easily as her
schemes of reformation and education would allow him to

Queen Mary died before her time respected by all who knew or had heard
of her The nearest squatters wife sent a pair of sheets for a shroud
with instructions to lay Mary out and arranged by bush telegraph to
drive over next morning with her sisterinlaw and two other white women
in the vicinity to see Mary decently buried

But the remnant of Jimmies tribe were there beforehand They tore the
sheets in strips and tied Mary up in a bundle with her chin to her
kneespreparing her for burial in their own fashionand mourned all
night in whitewash and ashes At least the gins did The white women
saw that it was hopeless to attempt to untie any of the innumerable
knots and double knots even if it had been possible to lay Mary out
afterwards so they had to let her be buried as she was with black and
white obsequies And weve got no interest in believing that she did not
jump up white woman long ago

My uncle and his brother took the two eldest boys Black Jimmie
shifted away from the hut at once with the rest of his familyfor the
devildevil sat down thereand Marys name was strictly tabooed in
accordance with aboriginal etiquette

Jimmie drifted back towards the graves of his fathers in company with
a decreasing flock of sheep day by day for the house of my uncle had
fallen on times of drought and depression and footrot and wool rings
and overdrafts and bank owners and a few strips of bark a dying
fire a black pipe some greasy possum rugs and blankets a litter of
kangaroo tails etc four neglected piccaninnies half a score of mangy
mongrels and haply a lilly drap o rum by night

The four little Australians grew dirtier and more shy and savage and
ate underdone kangaroo and possum and native bear with an occasional
treat of oak grubs and goanna by preferenceand died out one by
one as blacks do when brought within the ever widening circle of
civilisation Jimmie moved promptly after each death and left the
evil one in possession and built another miamiaeach one being less
pretentious than the last Finally he was left the last of his tribe
to mourn his lot in solitude

But the devildevil came and sat down by King Jimmies side one night
so he too moved out across the Old Man border and the miamia rotted
into the ground and the grass grew there

     

I admired Joe I thought him wiser and cleverer than any white boy in
the world He could smell out possums unerringly and I firmly believed
he could see yards through the muddiest of dam water for once when I
dropped my boat in and was not sure of the spot he fished it out first
try With cotton reels and bits of stick and bark he would make the
model of a station homestead slaughteryards sheepyards and all
complete working in ideas and improvements of his own which might
have been put into practice with advantage He was a most original and
interesting liar upon all subjects upon which he was ignorant and
which came up incidentally He gave me a very interesting account of an
interview between his father and Queen Victoria and mentioned casually
that his father had walked across the Thames without getting wet

He also told me how he Joe had tied a mounted trooper to a verandah
post and thrashed him with pine saplings until the timber gave out and
he was tired I questioned Jimmie but the incidents seemed to have
escaped the old kings memory

Joe could build bigger woodheaps with less wood than any black or white
tramp or loafer round there He was a born architect He took a world
of pains with his woodheapshe built them hollow in the shape of a
breakwind with the convex side towards the house for the benefit of
his employers Joe was easygoing he had inherited a love of peace and
quietness from his father Uncle generally came home after dark and Joe
would have little fires lit at safe distances all round the house
in order to convey an impression that the burning off was proceeding
satisfactorily

When the warm weather came Joe and I got into trouble with an old hag
for bathing in a waterhole in the creek in front of her shanty and she
impounded portions of our wardrobe We shouldnt have lost much if she
had taken it all but our sense of injury was deep especially as she
used very bad grammar towards us

Joe addressed her from the safe side of the water He said Look here
Old leatherface sugareye plarbag marmy I call it you

Plarbag marmy meant Mother Flourbag and ration sugar was
decidedly muddy in appearance

She came round the waterhole with a clothes prop and made good time
too but we got across and away with our clothes

That little incident might have changed the whole course of my
existence Plarbag Marmy made a formal complaint to uncle who happened
to pass there on horseback about an hour later and the same evening
Joes latest and most carefully planned wood heap collapsed while aunt
was pulling a stick out of it in the dark and it gave her a bad scare
the results of which might have been serious

So uncle gave us a thrashing without the slightest regard for racial
distinctions and sent us to bed without our suppers

We sought Jimmies camp but Joe got neither sympathy nor damper from
his father and I was sent home with a fatherly lecture for going
alonga that fella meaning Joe

Joe and I discussed existence at a waterhole down the creek next
afternoon over a billy of crawfish which we had boiled and a piece of
gritty damper and decided to retire beyond the settled districtssome
five hundred miles or soto a place that Joe said he knew of where
there were lagoons and billabongs ten miles wide alive with ducks and
fish and black cockatoos and kangaroos and wombats that only waited to
be knocked over with a stick

I thought I might as well start and be a blackfellow at once so we
got a rusty pan without a handle and cooked about a pint of fat yellow
oakgrubs and I was about to fall to when we were discovered and the
full weight of combined family influence was brought to bear on the
situation We had broken a new pair of shears digging out those grubs
from under the bark of the sheoaks and had each taken a blade as his
own especial property which we thought was the best thing to do under
the circumstances Uncle wanted those shears badly so he received us
with the buggy whipand he didnt draw the colour line either All
that night and next day I wished he had I was sent home and Joe went
droving with uncle soon after that else I might have lived a life of
freedom and content and died out peacefully with the last of my adopted
tribe

Joe died of consumption on the track When he was dying uncle asked Is
there anything you would like

And Joe said Id like a lilly drap o rum boss

Which were his last words for he drank the rum and died peacefully

I was the first to hear the news at home and being still a youngster
I ran to the house crying Oh mother aunts Joe is dead

There were visitors at our place at the time and as the eldest child
of the maternal aunt in question had also been christened Joeafter a
grandfather of our tribe my tribe not Black Joesthe news caused
a sudden and unpleasant sensation But crossexamination explained the
mistake and I retired to the rear of the pigsty as was my custom when
things went wrong with another cause for grief




They Wait on the Wharf in Black

 Seems to me that honest hardworking men seem to accumulate
 the heaviest swags of trouble in this worldSteelman

 Told by Mitchells Mate



We were coming back from West Australia steerageMitchell the Oracle
and I I had gone over saloon with a few pounds in my pocket Mitchell
said this was a great mistakeI should have gone over steerage with
nothing but the clothes I stood upright in and come back saloon with a
pile He said it was a very common mistake that men made but as far
as his experience went there always seemed to be a deeprooted popular
prejudice in favour of going away from home with a few pounds in ones
pocket and coming back stumped at least amongst rovers and vagabonds
like ourselvesit wasnt so generally popular or admired at home or in
the places we came back to as it was in the places we went to Anyway
it went there wasnt the slightest doubt that our nearest and dearest
friends were as a rule in favour of our taking away as little as we
could possibly manage with and coming back with a pile whether we came
back saloon or not and that ought to settle the matter as far as any
chap that had the slightest consideration for his friends or family was
concerned

There was a good deal of misery underneath coming home in that
steerage One man had had his hand crushed and amputated out Coolgardie
way and the stump had mortified and he was being sent to Melbourne by
his mates Some had lost their money some a couple of years of their
life some their souls but none seemed to have lost the heart to
call up the quiet grin that southern rovers vagabonds travellers for
graft or fortune and professional wanderers wear in front of it
all Except one manan elderly eastern diggerhe had lost his wife in
Sydney while he was away

They sent him a wire to the Boulder Soak or somewhere out back of
White Feather to say that his wife was seriously ill but the wire went
wrong somehow after the manner of telegrams not connected with mining
on the lines of the Western They sent him a wire to say that his wife
was dead and that reached him all rightonly a week late

I can imagine it He got the message at dinnertime or when they came
back to the camp His mate wanted him to sit in the shade or lie in
the tent while he got the billy boiled You must brace up and pull
yourself together Tom for the sake of the youngsters And Tom for
long intervals goes walking up and down up and down by the campunder
the brassy sky or the gloamingunder the brilliant starclusters that
hang over the desert plain but never raising his eyes to them kicking
a tuft of grass or a hole in the sand now and then and seeming to watch
the progress of the track he is tramping out The wife of twenty years
was with himthough two thousand miles awaytill that message came

I can imagine Tome sitting with his mates round the billy they talking
in quiet subdued tones about the track the departure of coaches
trains and boatsarranging for Toms journey East and the working of
the claim in his absence Or Tom lying on his back in his bunk with his
hands under his head and his eyes fixed on the calico abovethinking
thinking thinking Thinking with a touch of his boyhoods faith
perhaps or wondering what he had done in his long hardworking married
life that God should do this thing to him now of all times

Youd best take what money we have in the camp Tom youll want it
all agin the time you get back from Sydney and we can fix it up
arterwards Theres a couple o clean shirts o mineyoud best take
emyoull want em on the voyage You might as well take them there
new pants o mine theyll only dryrot out hereand the coat too
if you likeits too small for me anyway You wont have any time in
Perth and youll want some decent togs to land with in Sydney

     

I wouldnt a cared so much if Id a seen the last of her he said
in a quiet patient voice to us one night by the rail I would a
liked to have seen the last of her

Have you been long in the West

Over two years I made up to take a run across last Christmas and have
a look at em But I couldnt very well get away when exemptiontime
came I didnt like to leave the claim

Do any good over there

Well things brightened up a bit the last month or two I had a hard
pull at first landed without a penny and had to send back every
shilling I could rake up to get things straightened up a bit at home
Then the eldest boy fell ill and then the baby Id reckoned on
bringing em over to Perth or Coolgardie when the cool weather came and
having them somewheres near me where I could go and have a look at em
now and then and look after them

Going back to the West again

Oh yes I must go for the sake of the youngsters But I dont seem
to have much heart in it He smoked awhile Over twenty years we
struggled along togetherthe missus and meand it seems hard that I
couldnt see the last of her Its rough on a man

The world is damned rough on a man sometimes said Mitchell most
especially when he least deserves it

The digger crossed his arms on the rail like an old cocky at the fence
in the cool of the evening yarning with an old crony

Morn twenty years she stuck to me and struggled along by my side She
never give in Ill swear she was on her feet till the last with
her sleeves tucked upbustlin round And just when things was
brightening and I saw a chance of giving her a bit of a rest and comfort
for the end of her life I thought of it all only tother week when
things was clearing up ahead and the last order I sent over I set
to work and wrote her a long letter putting all the good news and
encouragement I could think of into it I thought how that letter would
brighten up things at home and how shed read it round I thought of
lots of things that a man never gets time to think of while his nose is
kept to the grindstone And she was dead and in her grave and I never
knowed it

Mitchell dug his elbow into my ribs and made signs for the matches to
light his pipe

An yer never knowed reflected the Oracle

But I always had an idea when there was trouble at home the digger
went on presently in his quiet patient tone I always knowed I
always had a kind of feeling that wayI felt itno matter how far I
was away When the youngsters was sick I knowed it and I expected the
letter that come About a fortnight ago I had a feeling that way when
the wife was ill The very stars out there on the desert by the Boulder
Soak seemed to say Theres trouble at home Go home Theres trouble
at home But I never dreamed what that trouble was One night I did
make up my mind to start in the morning but when the morning came I
hadnt an excuse and was ashamed to tell my mates the truth They might
have thought I was going ratty like a good many go out there Then he
broke off with a sort of laugh as if it just struck him that we
might think he was a bit off his head or that his talk was getting
uncomfortable for us Curious aint it he said

Reminds me of a case I knowed commenced the Oracle after a
pause

I could have pitched him overboard but that was a mistake He and the
old digger sat on the forard hatch half the night yarning mostly about
queer starts and rum gos and curious cases the Oracle had knowed
and I think the Oracle did him a lot of good somehow for he seemed more
cheerful in the morning

We were overcrowded in the steerage but Mitchell managed to give up his
berth to the old digger without letting him know it Most of the chaps
seemed anxious to make a place at the first table and pass the first
helpings of the dishes to the old cove that had lost his missus

They all seemed to forget him as we entered the Heads they had their
own troubles to attend to They were in the shadow of the shame of
coming back hard up and the grins began to grow faint and sickly But I
didnt forget him I wish sometimes that I didnt take so much notice of
things

There was no mistaking themthe little group that stood apart near the
end of the wharf dressed in cheap black There was the eldest single
sisterthin pale and haggardlookingthat had had all the hard
worry in the family till her temper was spoilt as you could see by the
peevish irritable lines in her face She had to be the mother of them
all now and had never known perhaps what it was to be a girl or a
sweetheart She gave a hard mechanical sort of smile when she saw her
father and then stood looking at the boat in a vacant hopeless sort of
way There was the baby that he saw now for the first time crowing and
jumping at the sight of the boat coming in there was the eldest boy
looking awkward and out of place in his new slopsuit of black shifting
round uneasily and looking anywhere but at his father But the little
girl was the worst and a pretty little girl she was too she never
took her streaming eyes off her fathers face the whole time You could
see that her little heart was bursting and with pity for him They were
too far apart to speak to each other as yet The boat seemed a cruel
long long time swinging alongsideI wished theyd hurry up Hed
brought his traps up early and laid em on the deck under the rail he
stood very quiet with his hands behind him looking at his children He
had a strong square workmans face but I could see his chin and mouth
quivering under the stubbly irongrey beard and the lump working in
his throat and one strong hand gripped the other very tight behind but
his eyelids never quiveredonly his eyes seemed to grow more and more
sad and lonesome These are the sort of long cruel moments when a man
sits or stands very tight and quiet and calmlooking with his whole
past life going whirling through his brain year after year and over
and over again Just as the digger seemed about to speak to them he met
the brimming eyes of his little girl turned up to his face He looked
at her for a moment and then turned suddenly and went below as if
pretending to go down for his things I noticed that Mitchellwho
hadnt seemed to be noticing anything in particularfollowed him down
When they came on deck again we were right alongside

Ello Nell said the digger to the eldest daughter

Ello father she said with a sort of gasp but trying to smile

Ello Jack how are you getting on

All right father said the boy brightening up and seeming greatly
relieved

He looked down at the little girl with a smile that I cant describe
but didnt speak to her She still stood with quivering chin and mouth
and great brimming eyes upturned full of such pity as I never saw
before in a childfacepity for him

You can get ashore now said Mitchell see theyve got the gangway
out aft

Presently I saw Mitchell with the portmanteau in his hand and the baby
on his arm steering them away to a quiet corner of the shed at the top
of the wharf The digger had the little girl in his arms and both hers
were round his neck and her face hidden on his shoulder

When Mitchell came back he leant on the rail for a while by my side as
if it was a boundary fence out back and there was no hurry to break up
camp and make a start

What did you follow him below that time for Mitchell I asked
presently for want of something better to say

Mitchell looked at me out of the corners of his eyes

I wanted to score a drink he said I thought he wanted one and
wouldnt like to be a Jimmy Woodser




Seeing the Last of You



When youre going away by boat said Mitchell you ought to say
goodbye to the women at home and to the chaps at the last pub I hate
waiting on the wharf or up on deck when the boats behind time Theres
no sense in it and a lot of unnecessary misery Your friends wait on
the wharf and you are kept at the rail to the bitter end just when they
and you most want a spell And why Some of them hang out because they
love you and want to see the last of you some because they dont like
you to see them going away without seeing the last of you and you hang
out mostly because it would hurt em if you went below and didnt give
them a chance of seeing the last of you all the timeand you curse the
boat and wish to God it would start And those who love you mostthe
womenfolk of the familyand who are making all the fuss and breaking
their hearts about having to see the last of you and least want to do
itthey hang out the longest and are the most determined to see it
Wheres the sense in it Whats the good of seeing the last of you How
do women manage to get consolation out of a thing like that

But women get consolation out of queer things sometimes he added
reflectively and so do men

I remember when I was knocking about the coasts an old aunt of mine
always persisted in coming down to see the last of me and bringing the
whole family toono matter if I was only going away for a month I was
her favourite I always turned up again in a few months but if Id come
back every next boat it wouldnt have made the slightest difference to
her Shed say that I mightnt come back some day and then shed never
forgive herself nor the family for not seeing me off I suppose shell
see the end of me yet if she lives long enoughand shes a wiry old
lady of the old school She was oldfashioned and dressed like a fright
they said at home They hated being seen in public with her to tell the
truth I felt a bit ashamed too at times I wouldnt be now When Id
get her off on to the wharf Id be overcome with my feelings and have
to retire to the privacy of the bar to hide my emotions till the
boat was going And shed stand on the end of the pier and wave her
handkerchief and mop her old eyes with it until she was removed by
force

God bless her old heart There wasnt so much affection wasted on me
at home that I felt crowded by hers and I never lost anything by her
seeing the last of me

I do wish the Oracle would stop that confounded fiddle of hisit makes
you think over damned old things




Two Boys at Grinder Brothers



Five or six halfgrown larrikins sat on the cemented sill of the big
window of Grinder Bros Railway Coach Factory waiting for the work
bell and one of the number was Bill Andersonknown as Carstor
Hoila young terror of fourteen or fifteen

Here comes Balmy Arvie exclaimed Bill as a pale timidlooking little
fellow rounded the corner and stood against the wall by the door Hows
your parents Balmy

The boy made no answer he shrank closer to the entrance The first bell
went

What yer got for dinner Balmy Bread n treacle asked the young
ruffian then for the edification of his chums he snatched the boys
dinner bag and emptied its contents on the pavement

The door opened Arvie gathered up his lunch took his timeticket and
hurried in

Well Balmy said one of the smiths as he passed what do you think
of the boat race

I think said the boy goaded to reply that it would be better if
young fellows of this country didnt think so much about racin an
fightin

The questioner stared blankly for a moment then laughed suddenly in the
boys face and turned away The rest grinned

Arvies getting balmier than ever guffawed young Bill

Here Carstor Hoil cried one of the smiths strikers how much oil
will you take for a chew of terbaccer

Teaspoonful

No two

All right lets see the chew first

Oh youll get it What yer frighten of Come on chaps n see
Bill drink oil

Bill measured out some machine oil and drank it He got the tobacco and
the others got what they called the fun of seein Bill drink oil

The second bell rang and Bill went up to the other end of the shop
where Arvie was already at work sweeping shavings from under a bench

The young terror seated himself on the end of this bench drummed his
heels against the leg and whistled He was in no hurry for his foreman
had not yet arrived He amused himself by lazily tossing chips at
Arvie who made no protest for a while It would bebetterfor this
country said the young terror reflectively and abstractedly cocking
his eye at the whitewashed roof beams and feeling behind him on the
bench for a heavier chipit would be betterfor this countryif
young fellers didnt think so much aboutaboutracinAND fightin

You let me alone said Arvie

Why whatll you do exclaimed Bill bringing his eye down with
feigned surprise Then in an indignant tone I dont mind takin a
fall out of yer now if yer like

Arvie went on with his work Bill tossed all the chips within reach and
then sat carelessly watching some men at work and whistling the Dead
March Presently he asked

Whats yer name Balmy

No answer

Carnt yer answer a civil question Id soon knock the sulks out of yer
if I was yer father

My names Arvie you know that

Arvie what

Arvie Aspinall

Bill cocked his eye at the roof and thought a while and whistled then
he said suddenly

Say Balmy where dyer live

Jones Alley

What

Jones Alley

A short low whistle from Bill What house

Number Eight

Garn What yer givnus

Im telling the truth Whats there funny about it What do I want to
tell you a lie for

Why we lived there once Balmy Old folks livin

Mother is fathers dead

Bill scratched the back of his head protruded his under lip and
reflected

I say Arvie what did yer father die of

Heart disease He dropped down dead at his work

Long low intense whistle from Bill He wrinkled his forehead and
stared up at the beams as if he expected to see something unusual there
After a while he said very impressively So did mine

The coincidence hadnt done striking him yet he wrestled with it for
nearly a minute longer Then he said

I suppose yer mother goes out washin

Yes

N cleans offices

Yes

So does mine Any brothers n sisters

Twoone brother n one sister

Bill looked relievedfor some reason

I got nine he said Yours youngern you

Yes

Lot of bother with the landlord

Yes a good lot

Had any bailiffs in yet

Yes two

They compared notes a while longer and tailed off into a silence which
lasted three minutes and grew awkward towards the end

Bill fidgeted about on the bench reached round for a chip but
recollected himself Then he cocked his eye at the roof once more and
whistled twirling a shaving round his fingers the while At last
he tore the shaving in two jerked it impatiently from him and said
abruptly

Look here Arvie Im sorry I knocked over yer barrer yesterday

Thank you

This knocked Bill out the first round He rubbed round uneasily on
the bench fidgeted with the vise drummed his fingers whistled and
finally thrust his hands in his pockets and dropped on his feet

Look here Arvie he said in low hurried tones Keep close to me
goin out tonight n if any of the other chaps touches yer or says
anything to yer Ill hit em

Then he swung himself round the corner of a carriage body and was
gone

     

Arvie was late out of the shop that evening His boss was a
subcontractor for the coachpainting and always tried to find twenty
minutes work for his boys just about five or ten minutes before the
bell rang He employed boys because they were cheap and he had a lot of
rough work and they could get under floors and bogies with their pots
and brushes and do all the priming and paint the trucks His name was
Collins and the boys were called Collins Babies It was a joke
in the shop that he had a weaning contract The boys were all over
fourteen of course because of the Education Act Some were nine or
tenwages from five shillings to ten shillings It didnt matter
to Grinder Brothers so long as the contracts were completed and the
dividends paid Collins preached in the park every Sunday But this has
nothing to do with the story

When Arvie came out it was beginning to rain and the hands had all gone
except Bill who stood with his back to a verandahpost spitting with
very fair success at the ragged toe of one boot He looked up nodded
carelessly at Arvie and then made a dive for a passing lorry on the
end of which he disappeared round the next corner unsuspected by the
driver who sat in front with his pipe in his mouth and a bag over his
shoulders

Arvie started home with his heart and mind pretty full and a stronger
stranger aversion to ever going back to the shop again This new
unexpected and unsoughtfor friendship embarrassed the poor lonely
child It wasnt welcome

But he never went back He got wet going home and that night he was a
dying child He had been ill all the time and Collins was one baby
short next day




The Selectors Daughter



 I

She rode slowly down the steep siding from the main road to a track in
the bed of the Long Gully the old grey horse picking his way zigzag
fashion She was about seventeen slight in figure and had a pretty
freckled face with a pathetically drooping mouth and big sad brown
eyes She wore a faded print dress with an old black riding skirt drawn
over it and her head was hidden in one of those ugly oldfashioned
white hoods which seen from the rear always suggest an old woman
She carried several parcels of groceries strapped to the front of the
dilapidated sidesaddle

The track skirted a chain of rocky waterholes at the foot of the gully
and the girl glanced nervously at these ghastly evillooking pools as
she passed them by The sun had set as far as Long Gully was concerned
The old horse carefully followed a rough bridle track which ran up the
gully now on one side of the watercourse and now on the other the gully
grew deeper and darker and its sullen scrubcovered sides rose more
steeply as he progressed

The girl glanced round frequently as though afraid of someone following
her Once she drew rein and listened to some bush sound Kangaroos
she murmured it was only kangaroos She crossed a dimmed little
clearing where a farm had been and entered a thick scrub of box and
stringybark saplings Suddenly with a heavy thud thud an old man
kangaroo leapt the path in front startling the girl fearfully and went
up the siding towards the peak

Oh my God she gasped with her hand on her heart

She was very nervous this evening her heart was hurt now and she held
her hand close to it while tears started from her eyes and glistened in
the light of the moon which was rising over the gap ahead

Oh if I could only go away from the bush she moaned

The old horse plodded on and now and then shook his headsadly it
seemedas if he knew her troubles and was sorry

She passed another clearing and presently came to a small homestead in
a stringybark hollow below a great gap in the ridgesDeadmans
Gap The place was called Deadmans Hollow and looked like it
The housea low tworoomed affair with skillionswas built of
halfround slabs and stringybark and was nearly all roof the bark
being darkened from recent rain gave it a drearier appearance than
usual

A big coarselooking youth of about twenty was nailing a green kangaroo
skin to the slabs he was out of temper because he had bruised his
thumb The girl unstrapped the parcels and carried them in as she
passed her brother she said

Take the saddle off for me will you Jack

Oh carnt yer take it off yerself he snarled carnt yer see Im
busy

She took off the saddle and bridle and carried them into a shed where
she hung them on a beam The patient old hack shook himself with an
energy that seemed illadvised considering his age and condition and
went off towards the dam

An old woman sat in the main room beside a fireplace which took up
almost the entire end of the house A planktable supported on stakes
driven into the ground stood in the middle of the room and two slab
benches were fixtures on each side The floor was clay All was clean
and povertystricken all that could be whitewashed was white and
everything that could be washed was scrubbed The slab shelves were
covered with clean newspapers on which bright tins and pannikins and
fragments of crockery were set to the greatest advantage The walls
however were disfigured by Christmas supplements of illustrated
journals

The girl came in and sat down wearily on a stool opposite to the old
woman

Are you any better mother she asked

Very little Mary very little Have you seen your father

No

I wonder where he is

You might wonder Whats the use of worrying about it mother

I suppose hes drinking again

Most likely Worrying yourself to death wont help it

The old woman sat and moaned about her troubles as old women do She
had plenty to moan about

I wonder where your brother Tom is We havent heard from him for a
year now He must be in trouble again something tells me he must be in
trouble again

Mary swung her hood off into her lap

Why do you worry about it mother Whats the use

I only wish I knew I only wish I knew

What good would that do You know Tom went droving with Fred Dunn and
Fred will look after him and besides Toms older now and got more
sense

Oh you dont careyou dont care You dont feel it but Im his
mother and

Oh for Gods sake dont start that again mother it hurts me more
than you think Im his sister Ive suffered enough God knows Dont
make matters worse than they are

Here comes father shouted one of the children outside n hes
bringing home a steer

The old woman sat still and clasped her hands nervously Mary tried to
look cheerful and moved the saucepan on the fire A big darkbearded
man mounted on a small horse was seen in the twilight driving a steer
towards the cowyard A boy ran to let down the sliprails

Presently Mary and her mother heard the clatter of rails let down and
put up again and a minute later a heavy step like the tread of a horse
was heard outside The selector lumbered in threw his hat in a
corner and sat down by the table His wife rose and bustled round with
simulated cheerfulness Presently Mary hazarded

Where have you been father

Somewheers

There was a wretched silence lasting until the old woman took courage
to say timidly

So youve brought a steer Wylie

Yes he snapped the tone seemed defiant

The old womans hands trembled so that she dropped a cup Mary turned a
shade paler

Here git me some tea Git me some TEA shouted Mr Wylie I aint
agoin to sit here all night

His wife made what haste her nervousness would allow and they soon sat
down to tea Jack the eldest son was sulky and his father muttered
something about knocking the sulks out of him with an axe

Whats annoyed you Jack asked his mother humbly

He scowled and made no answer

The younger childrenthree boys and a girlbegan quarrelling as soon
as they sat down Wylie yelled at them now and then and grumbled at the
cooking and at his wife for not being able to keep the children quiet
It was Marther you didnt put no sugar in my tea Mother Jimmys
got my place make him move Mawther do speak to this Fred Oh
father this big brute of a Harrys kickin me And so on


 II

When the miserable meal was over Wylie got a rope and a butchers
knife and went out to slaughter the steer but first there was a row
because he thoughtor pretended to thinkthat somebody had been
using his knife He lassoed the beast drew it up to the rails and
slaughtered it

Meanwhile Jack and his next brother took an old gun let the dogs
loose and went possum shooting

Presently Wylie came in again sat down by the fire and smoked The
children quarrelled over a boys book Mrs Wylie made weak attempts
to keep the peace but they took no notice of her Suddenly her husband
rose with an oath seized the novel and threw it behind the fire

Git to bed git to bed he roared at the children git to bed or
Ill smash your brains with the axe

They got to bed It was made of saplings and bark covered with three
bushelbags full of straw and old pieces of blanket sewn together The
children quarrelled in bed till their father took off his belt and went
into them according to promise There was a sudden hush followed by
a sound like a birdclapper then howls then a peaceful calm fell upon
that happy home

Wylie went out again and was absent an hour on his return he sat by
the fire and smoked sullenly After a while he snatched the pipe from
his mouth and looked impatiently at the old woman

Oh for Gods sake git to bed he snapped and dont be asittin
there like a blarsted funeral Youre enough to give a man the dismals

Mrs Wylie gathered up her sewing and retired Then he said to his
daughter You come and hold the candle

Mary put on her hood and followed her father to the yard The carcase
lay close to the rails against which two sheets of bark had been raised
as a breakwind The beast had been partly skinned and a portion of
the hide where a brand might have been was carefully turned back Mary
noticed this at once Her father went on with his work and occasionally
grumbled at her for not holding the candle right

Where did you buy the steer father she asked

Ask no questions and hear no lies Then he added Carnt you see its
a clear skin

She had a keen sense of humour and the idea of a clear skin steer
would have amused her at any other time She didnt smile now

He turned the carcase over the loose hide fell back and the light
shone on a distinct brand White as a sheet went Marys face and her
hand trembled so that she nearly let the candle fall

What are you adoin of now shouted her father Hold the candle
carnt you Youre worse than the old woman

Father the beast is branded See What does PB stand for

Poor Beggar like myself Hold the candle carnt youand hold your
tongue

Mary was startled again by hearing the tread of a horse but it was only
the old grey munching round Her father finished skinning and drew the
carcase up to a makeshift gallows Now you can go to bed he said
in a gentler tone

She went to her bedrooma small low slab skillion built on to the
end of the houseand fell on her knees by the bunk

God help me God help us all she cried

She lay down but could not sleep She was nervously illnearly mad
because of the dark disgraceful cloud of trouble which hung over her
home Always in troublealways in trouble It started long ago when
her favourite brother Tom ran away She was little more than a child
then intensely sensitive and when she sat in the old bark school she
fancied that the other children were thinking or whispering to each
other Her brothers in prison Mary Wylies brothers in prison Tom
Wylies in gaol She was thinking of it still They were ever with her
those horrible days and nights of the first shadow of shame She had the
same horror of evil the same fearful dread of disgrace that her mother
had She had been ambitious she had managed to read much and had wild
dreams of going to the city and rising above the common level but that
was all past now

How could she rise when the cruel hand of disgrace was ever ready to
drag her down at any moment Ah God she moaned in her misery if
we could only be born without kinwith no one to disgrace us but
ourselves Its cruel God its cruel to suffer for the crimes of
others She was getting selfish in her troubleslike her mother I
want to go away from the bush and all I know O God help me to
go away from the bush Presently she fell asleepif sleep it may be
calledand dreamt of sailing away sailing away far out on the sea
beyond the horizon of her dread Then came a horrible nightmare in
which she and all her family were arrested for a terrible crime She
woke in a fright and saw a reddish glare on the window Her father
was poking round some logs where they had been burningoff A pungent
odour came through a broken pane and turned her sick He was burning the
hide


Wylie did not go to bed that night he got his breakfast before
daylight and rode up through the frosty gap while the stars were still
out carrying a bag of beef in front of him on the grey horse Mary said
nothing about the previous night Her mother wondered how much father
had given for the steer and supposed he had gone into town to sell
the hide the poor soul tried to believe that he had come by the steer
honestly Mary fried some meat and tried to eat it for her mothers
sake but could manage only a few mouthfuls Mrs Wylie also seemed
to have lost her appetite Jack and his brother who had been out
all night made a hearty breakfast Then Jimmy started to peg out the
possum skins while Jack went to look for a missing pony Mary was left
to milk all the cows and feed the calves and pigs


Shortly after dinner one of the children ran to the door and cried

Why motherheres three mounted troopers comin up the gully

Oh my God cried the mother sinking back in her chair and trembling
like a leaf The children ran and hid in the scrub Mary stood up
terribly calm and waited The eldest trooper dismounted came to the
door glanced suspiciously at the remains of the meal and abruptly
asked the dreaded question

Mrs Wylie wheres your husband

She dropped the teacup from which she had pretended to be drinking
unconcernedly

What Why what do you want my husband for she asked in pitiful
desperation SHE looked like the guilty party

Oh you know well enough he sneered impatiently

Mary rose and faced him How dare you talk to my mother like that she
cried If my poor brother Tom was only hereyouyou coward

The youngest trooper whispered something to his senior and then stung
by a sharp retort said

Well you neednt be a pig

His two companions passed through into the spare skillion where they
found some beef in a cask and more already salted down under a bag on
the end of a bench then they went out at the back and had a look at the
cowyard The younger trooper lingered behind

Ill try and get them up the gully on some excuse he whispered to
Mary You plant the hide before we come back

Its too late Look there She pointed through the doorway

The other two were at the logs where the fire had been the burning hide
had stuck to the logs in places like glue

Wylies a fool remarked the old trooper


 III

Jack disappeared shortly after his fathers arrest on a charge of horse
and cattlestealing and Tom the prodigal turned up unexpectedly
He was different from his father and eldest brother He had an open
goodhumoured face and was very kindhearted but was subject to
peculiar fits of insanity during which he did wild and foolish things
for the mere love of notoriety He had two naturesone bright and
good the other sullen and criminal A taint of madness ran in the
familycame down from drunken and unprincipled fathers of dead
generations under different conditions it might have developed into
genius in one or twoin Mary perhaps

Cheer up old woman cried Tom patting his mother on the back Well
be happy yet Ive been wild and foolish I know and gave you some
awful trouble but thats all done with I mean to keep steady and
byandbye well go away to Sydney or Queensland Give us a smile
mother

He got some grubbing to do and for six months kept the family
in provisions Then a change came over him He became moody and
sulleneven brutal He would sit for hours and grin to himself without
any apparent cause then he would stay away from home for days together

Toms going wrong again wailed Mrs Wylie Hell get into trouble
again I know he will We are disgraced enough already God knows

Youve done your best mother said Mary and can do no more
People will pity us after all the thing itself is not so bad as the
everlasting dread of it This will be a lesson for fatherhe wanted
oneand maybe hell be a better man She knew better than that YOU
did your best mother

Ah Mary you dont know what Ive gone through these thirty years
in the bush with your father Ive had to go down on my knees and beg
people not to prosecute himand the same with your brother Tom and
this is the end of it

Better to have let them go mother you should have left father when
you found out what sort of a man he was it would have been better for
all

It was my duty to stick by him child he was my husband Your father
was always a bad man Marya bad man I found it out too late I could
not tell you a quarter of what I have suffered with him I was proud
Mary I wanted my children to be better than others Its my fault
its a judgment I wanted to make my children better than others
I was so proud Mary

Mary had a sweetheart a drover who was supposed to be in Queensland
He had promised to marry her and take her and her mother away when he
returned at least she had promised to marry him on that condition He
had now been absent on his latest trip for nearly six months and there
was no news from him She got a copy of a country paper to look for the
stock passings but a startling headline caught her eye


 IMPUDENT ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY UNDER ARMS
 
 A drover known to the police as Frederick Dunn alias Drew
 was arrested last week at


She read to the bitter end and burned the paper And the shadow of
another trouble darker and drearier than all the rest was upon her

So the little outcast family in Long Gully existed for several months
seeing no one save a sympathetic old splitter who would come and smoke
his pipe by the fire of nights and try to convince the old woman that
matters might have been worse and that she wouldnt worry so much if
she knew the troubles of some of our biggest families and that things
would come out all right and the lesson would do Wylie good Also that
Tom was a different boy altogether and had more sense than to go
wrong again It was nothing he said nothing they didnt know what
trouble was

But one day when Mary and her mother were alone the troopers came
again

Mrs Wylie wheres your son Tom they asked

She sat still She didnt even cry Oh my God

Dont be frightened Mrs Wylie said one of the troopers gently It
aint for much anyway and maybe Tomll be able to clear himself

Mary sank on her knees by her mothers side crying Speak to me
mother Oh my God shes dying Speak for my sake mother Dont die
mother its all a mistake Dont die and leave me here alone

But the poor old woman was dead

     

Wylie came out towards the end of the year and a few weeks later he
brought home aanother woman


 IV

Bob Bentley general hawker was camping under some rocks by the main
road near the foot of Long Gully His mate was fast asleep under the
tilted trap Bob stood with his back to the fire his pipe in his mouth
and his hands clasped behind him The fire lit up the undersides of the
branches above a native bear sat in a fork blinking down at it while
the moon above him showed every hair on his ears From among the trees
came the pleasant jingle of hobblechains the slow tread of hoofs and
the crunch crunch at the grass as the horses moved about and grazed
now in moonlight now in the soft shadows Old Thunder a big black
dog of no particular breed gave a meaning look at his master and
started up the ridge followed by several smaller dogs Soon Bob heard
from the hillside the hyyihi whomp whomp whomp of old Thunder
and the yopyopyopping of the smaller frythey had treed a possum
Bob threw himself on the grass and pretended to be asleep There was
a sound as of a sizeable boulder rolling down the hill and presently
Thunder trotted round the fire to see if his master would come Bob
snored The dog looked suspiciously at him trotted round once or twice
and as a last resource gave him two great slobbery licks across the
face Bob got up with a goodnatured oath

Well old party he said to Thunder youre a thundering old
nuisance but I spose you wont be satisfied till I come He got a gun
from the waggonette loaded it and started up the ridge old Thunder
rushing to and fro to show the wayas if the row the other dogs were
making wasnt enough to guide his master

When Bob returned with the possums he was startled to see a woman in
the camp She was sitting on a log by the fire with her elbows on her
knees and her face in her hands

Whywhat the devwho are you

The girl raised a white desperate face to him It was Mary Wylie

My father andand the womantheyre drinkingthey turned me out
they turned me out

Did they now Im sorry for that What can I do for you Shes mad
sure enough he thought to himself I thought it was a ghost

I dont know she wailed I dont know Youre a man and Im a
helpless girl They turned me out My mothers dead and my brothers
gone away Look Look here pointing to a bruise on her forehead The
woman did that My own father stood by and saw it donesaid it served
me right Oh my God

What woman Tell me all about it

The woman father brought home I want to go away from the bush Oh
for Gods sake take me away from the bush Anything anythingyou
knowonly take me away from the bush

Bob and his matewho had been rouseddid their best to soothe her
but suddenly without a moments warning she sprang to her feet and
scrambled to the top of the rock overhanging the camp She stood for a
moment in the bright moonlight gazing intently down the vacant road

Here they come she cried pointing down the road Here they
comethe troopers I can see their cappeaks glistening in
the moonlight Im going away Mothers gone Im going
nowGoodbyeGoodbye Im going away from the bush

Then she ran through the trees towards the foot of Long Gully Bob and
his mate followed but being unacquainted with the locality they lost
her

She ran to the edge of a granite cliff on the higher side of the deepest
of the rocky waterholes There was a heavy splash and three startled
kangaroos who had been drinking leapt back and sped away like three
grey ghosts up the ridge towards the moonlit peak




Mitchell on the Sex and Other Problems



I agree with T in last weeks Bulletin said Mitchell after
cogitating some time over the last drop of tea in his pannikin held
at various angles about what they call the Sex Problem Theres no
problem really except Creation and thats not our affair we cant
solve it and weve no right to make a problem out of it for ourselves
to puzzle over and waste the little time that is given us about Its
we that make the problems not Creation We make em and they only
smother us theyll smother the world in the end if we dont look
out Anything that can be argued for and against from half a dozen
different points of viewand most things that men argue over can
beand anything that has been argued about for thousands of years as
most things have is worse than profitless it wastes the worlds time
and ours and often wrecks old mateships Seems to me the deeper you
read think talk or write about things that end in ism the less
satisfactory the result the more likely you are to get bushed and
dissatisfied with the world And the more you keep on the surface of
plain things the plainer the sailingthe more comfortable for you and
everybody else Weve always got to come to the surface to breathe in
the end in any case were meant to live on the surface and we might
as well stay there and look after it and ourselves for all the good we
do diving down after fish that arent there except in our imagination
And some of em are very dead fish toothe Sex Problem for
instance When we fall off the surface of the earth it will be time
enough to make a problem out of the fact that we couldnt stick on Im
a Federal Protrader in this country Im a Federalist because I think
Federation is the plain and natural course for Australia and Im a
Freetectionist because Im in favour of sinking any question or any
two things that enlightened people can argue and fight over and try
one after the other for fifty years without being able to come to a
decision about or prove which is best for the welfare of the country
It only wastes a young countrys time and keeps it off the right track
Federation isnt a problemits a plain factbut they make a problem
out of every panel they have to push down in the rotten old boundary
fences

Personal interests suggested Joe

Of course Its personal interest of the wrong sort that makes all the
problems You can trace the sex problem to people who trade in unhealthy
personal interests I believe in personal interests of the right
sorttrue individualism If we all looked after ourselves and our
wives and familiesif we have anyin the proper way the world would
be all right We waste too much time looking after each other

Now supposing were travelling and have to get a shed and make a
cheque sos to be able to send a few quid home as soon as we can to
the missus or the old folks and the next water is twenty miles ahead
If we sat down and argued over a social problem till doomsday we
wouldnt get to the tank wed die of thirst and the missus and kids
or the old folks would be sold up and turned out into the streets
and have to fall back on a home of hope or wait their turn at the
Benevolent Asylum with bags for broken victuals Ive seen that and I
dont want anybody belonging to me to have to do it

Reminds me that when a poor deserted girl goes to a home they dont
make a problem of herthey do their best for her and try to get her
righted And the priests too if theres anything in the sex or any
other problemanything that hasnt been threshed outtheyre the men
thatll know it Im not a Catholic but I know this that if a girl
thats been left by oneno matter what Church she belongs togoes to
the priest theyll work all the points they know and they know em
all to get her righted and if the chap or his people wont come up
to the scratch Father Ryanll frighten hell out of em I cant say as
much for our own Churches

But youre in favour of socialism and democracy asked Joe

Of course I am But the world wont do any good arguing over it
The people will have to get up and walk and whats more stick
togetherand I dont think theyll ever do thatit aint in human
nature Socialism or democracy was all right in this country till
it got fashionable and was made a fad or a problem of Then it got
smothered pretty quick And a fad or a problem always breeds a host of
parasites or hangerson Why as soon as I saw the advanced idealist
foolstheyre generally the middleclass shabbygenteel families that
catch Spiritualism and Theosophy and those sort of complaints at the
end of the epidemicthat catch on at the tailend of things and think
theyve caught something brand shining newas soon as I saw them
and the problem spielers and notorietyhunters of both sexes beginning
to hang round Australian Unionism I knew it was doomed And so it was
The straight men were disgusted or driven out There are women who hang
on for the same reason that a girl will sometimes go into the dock and
swear an innocent mans life away But as soon as they see that the
cause is dying they drop it at once and wait for another They come
like bloody dingoes round a calf and only leave the bones Theyre
about as democratic as the crows And the rotten sexproblem sort of
thing is the cause of it all it poisons weak mindsand strong ones too
sometimes

Why you could make a problem out of Epsom salts You might argue as to
why human beings want Epsom salts and try to trace the causes that
led up to it I dont like the taste of Epsom saltsits nasty in
the mouthbut when I feel that way I take em and I feel better
afterwards and thats good enough for me We might argue that black is
white and white is black and neither of em is anything and nothing
is everything and a womans a man and a mans a woman and its really
the man that has the youngsters only we imagine its the woman because
she imagines that she has all the pain and trouble and the doctor is
under the impression that hes attending to her not the man and the
man thinks so too because he imagines hes walking up and down outside
and slipping into the corner pub now and then for a nip to keep his
courage up waiting when its his wife thats doing that all the time
we might argue that its all force of imagination and that imagination
is an unknown force and that the unknown is nothing But when weve
settled all that to our own satisfaction how much further ahead are we
In the end well come to the conclusion that we aint alive and never
existed and then well leave off bothering and the world will go on
just the same

What about science asked Joe

Science aint sex problems its facts Now I dont mind
Spiritualism and those sort of things they might help to break the
monotony and cant do much harm But the sex problem as its written
about today does its dangerous and dirty and its time to settle it
with a club Science and education if left alone will look after sex
facts

You cant get anything out of the sex problem no matter how you
argue In the old Bible times they had half a dozen wives each but we
dont know for certain how THEY got on The Mormons tried it again and
seemed to get on all right till we interfered We dont seem to be able
to get on with one wife nowat least according to the sex problem
The sex problem troubled the Turks so much that they tried three Lots
of us try to settle it by knocking round promiscuously and that leads
to actions for maintenance and breach of promise cases and all sorts of
trouble Our blacks settle the sex problem with a club and so far I
havent heard any complaints from them

     

Take hereditary causes and surrounding circumstances for instance In
order to understand or judge a man right you would need to live under
the same roof with him from childhood and under the same roofs or
tents with his parents right back to Adam and then youd be blocked
for want of more ancestors through which to trace the causes that led
to AbelI mean Caingoing on as he did Whats the use or sense of it
You might argue away in any direction for a million miles and a million
years back into the past but youve got to come back to where you are
if you wish to do any good for yourself or anyone else

Sometimes it takes you a long while to get back to where you
aresometimes you never do it Why when those controversies were
started in the Bulletin about the kangaroos and other things I
thought I knew something about the bush Now Im damned if Im sure I
could tell a kangaroo from a wombat

Trying to find out things is the cause of all the work and trouble in
this world It was Eves fault in the first placeor Adams rather
because it might be argued that he should have been master Some men are
too lazy to be masters in their own homes and run the show properly
some are too careless and some too drunk most of their time and some
too weak If Adam and Eve hadnt tried to find out things thered have
been no toil and trouble in the world today thered have been no
bloated capitalists and no hornyhanded working men and no politics
no freetrade and protectionand no clothes The woman next door
wouldnt be able to pick holes in your wifes washing on the line Wed
have been all running about in a big Garden of Eden with nothing on and
nothing to do except loaf and make love and lark and laugh and play
practical jokes on each other

Joe grinned

That would have been glorious Wouldnt it Joe Thered have been no
sex problem then




The Masters Mistake



William Spencer stayed away from school that hot day and went
swimming The master wrote a note to Williams father and gave it to
Williams brother Joe to carry home

Youll give that to your father tonight Joseph

Yes sir

Bill waited for Joe near the gap and walked home with him

I spose youve got a note for father

Yes said Joe

I spose you know whats in it

Yeyes Oh why did you stop away Bill

You dont mean to say that youre dirty mean enough to give it to
father Hey

I must Will I promised the master

He neednt never know

Oh yes he will Hes coming over to our place on Saturday and hes
sure to ask me tomorrow

Pause

Look here Joe said Bill I dont want to get a hiding and go
without supper tonight I promised to go possuming with Johnny
Nowlett and hes going to give me a fire out of his gun You can come
too I dont want to cop out on it tonightif I do Ill run away from
home again so there

Bill walked on a bit in moody Joe in troubled silence

Bill tried again he threatened argued and pleaded but Joe was firm
The master trusted me Will he said

Joe said Bill at last after a long pause I wouldnt do it to you

Joe was troubled

I wouldnt do it to you Joe

Joe thought how Bill had stood up and fought for him only last week

Id tear the note in bits Id tell a hundred lies Id take a dozen
hidings first JoeI would

Joe was greatly troubled His chest heaved and the tears came to his
eyes

Id do more than that for you Joe and you know it

Joe knew it They were crossing the old goldfield now There was a shaft
close to the path it had fallen in funnelshaped at the top but was
still thirty or forty feet deep some old logs were jammed across about
five feet down Joe suddenly snatched the note from his pocket and threw
it in It fluttered to the other side and rested on a piece of the old
timber Bill saw it but said nothing and seeing their father coming
home from work they hurried on

Joe was deep in trouble now Bill tried to comfort and cheer him but it
was no use Bill promised never to run away from home any more to go
to school every day and never to fight or steal or tell lies But Joe
had betrayed his trust for the first time in his life and wouldnt be
comforted

Some time in the night Bill woke and found Joe sitting up in bed
crying

Why whats the matter Joe

I never done a mean thing like that before sobbed Joe I wished Id
chucked meself down the shaft instead The master trusted me Will an
now if he asks me tomorrow Ill have to tell a lie

Then tell the truth Joe an take the hidin itll soon be overjust
a couple of cuts with the cane and itll be all over

Oh no it wont He wont never trust me any more Ive never been
caned in that school yet Will and if I am Ill never go again Oh why
will you run away from home Will and play the wag and steal and
get us all into such trouble You dont know how mother takes on about
ityou dont know how it hurts father Ive deceived the master and
mother and father today just because youre soso selfish and he
laid down and cried himself to sleep

Bill lay awake and thought till daylight then he got up quietly put on
his clothes and stole away from the house and across the flat followed
by the dog who thought it was a possumhunting expedition Bill wished
the dog would not be quite so demonstrative at least until they got
away from the house He went straight to the shaft let himself down
carefully on to one of the old logs and stooped to pick up the note
gleaming white in the sickly summer daylight Then the rotten timber
gave way suddenly without a moments warning

     

They found him that morning at about nine oclock The dog attracted
the attention of an old fossicker passing to his work The letter was
gripped in Bills right hand when they brought him up They took him
home and the father went for a doctor Bill came to himself a little
just before the last and said Mother I wasnt running away
mothertell father thatII wanted to try and catch a possum on the
ground Wheres Joe I want Joe Go out mother a minute and send
Joe

Here I am Bill said Joe in a choking terrified voice

Has the master been yet

No

The Story of the Oracle



We young fellows said Sympathy Joe to Mitchell after tea in
their first camp west the riverand you and I ARE young fellows
comparativelythink we know the world There are plenty of young chaps
knocking round in this country who reckon theyve been through it
all before theyre thirty Ive met cynics and menotheworld aged
twentyone or thereabouts whove never been further than a trip to
Sydney They talk about this world as if theyd knocked around in
halfadozen other worlds before they came across hereand they are
just as offhand about it as older Australians are when they talk about
this colony as compared with the others They say My oathsame
here Ive been there My oathyoure right Take it from me
and all that sort of thing They understand women and have a contempt
for em and chaps that dont talk as they talk or do as they do or
see as they see are either soft or ratty A good many reckon that life
aint blanky well worth livin sometimes they feel so blanky somehow
that they wouldnt give a blank whether they chucked it or not but
that sort never chuck it Its mostly the quiet men that do that and
if theyve got any complaints to make against the world they make em at
the head station Why Ive known healthy single young fellows
under twentyfive who drank to drown their troublessome because
they reckoned the world didnt understand nor appreciate emas if it
COULD

If the world dont understand or appreciate you said Mitchell
solemnly as he reached for a burning stick to light his pipeMAKE
it

To drown THEIR troubles continued Joe in a tone of impatient
contempt The Oracle must be well on towards the sixties he can take
his glass with any man but you never saw him drunk

Whats the Oracle to do with it

Did you ever hear his history

No Do you know it

Yes though I dont think he has any idea that I do Now we were
talking about the Oracle a little while ago We know hes an old ass
a good many outsiders consider that hes a bit soft or ratty and
as were likely to be mates together for some time on that fencing
contract if we get it you might as well know what sort of a man he is
and was sos you wont get uneasy about him if he gets deaf for a while
when youre talking or does funny things with his pipe or pintpot or
walks up and down by himself for an hour or so after tea or sits on a
log with his head in his hands or leans on the fence in the gloaming
and keeps looking in a blank sort of way straight ahead across the
clearing For hes gazing at something a thousand miles across country
southeast and about twenty years back into the past and no doubt he
sees himself as a young man and a Gippsland girl spooning under the
stars along between the hopgardens and the Mitchell River And if you
get holt of a fiddle or a concertina dont rasp or swank too much
on old tunes when hes round for the Oracle cant stand it Play
something lively Hell be down there at that surveyors camp yarning
till all hours so well have plenty of time for the storybut dont
you ever give him a hint that you know

My people knew him well I got most of the story from themmostly from
Uncle Bob who knew him better than any The rest leaked out through the
womenyou know how things leak out amongst women

Mitchell dropped his head and scratched the back of it HE knew

It was on the Cudgegong River My Uncle Bob was mates with him on one
of those rushes along therethe Pipeclay I think it was or the
Log Paddock The Oracle was a young man then of course and so was
Uncle Bob he was a match for most men You see the Oracle now and you
can imagine what he was when he was a young man Over six feet and as
straight as a sapling Uncle Bob said cleanlimbed and as fresh as
they made men in those days carried his hands behind him as he does
now when he hasnt got the swagbut his shoulders were back in
those days Of course he wasnt the Oracle then he was young Tom
Marshallbut that doesnt matter Everybody liked himespecially women
and children He was a bit happygolucky and careless but he didnt
know anything about this world and didnt bother about it he hadnt
been there And his heart was as good as gold my aunt used to
say He didnt understand women as we young fellows do nowadays and
therefore he hadnt any contempt for em Perhaps he understood and
understands them better than any of us without knowing it Anyway you
know hes always gentle and kind where a woman or child is concerned
and doesnt like to hear us talk about women as we do sometimes

There was a girl on the goldfieldsa fine lump of a blonde and pretty
gay She came from Sydney I think with her people who kept shanties
on the fields She had a splendid voice and used to sing Madeline
There might have been one or two bad women before that in the Oracles
world but no coldblooded designing ones He calls the bad ones
unfortunate

Perhaps it was Toms looks or his freshness or his innocence or
softnessor all togetherthat attracted her Anyway he got mixed up
with her before the goldfield petered out

No doubt it took a long while for the facts to work into Toms head
that a girl might sing like she did and yet be thoroughly unprincipled
The Oracle was always slow at coming to a decision but when he does
its generally the right one Anyway you can take that for granted for
you wont move him

I dont know whether he found out that she wasnt all that she
pretented to be to him or whether they quarrelled or whether she
chucked him over for a lucky digger Tom never had any luck on the
goldfields Anyway he left and went over to the Victorian side where
his people were and went up Gippsland way It was there for the first
time in his life that he got what you would call properly gone on a
girl he got hard hithe met his fate

Her name was Bertha Bredt I remember Aunt Bob saw her afterwards
Aunt Bob used to say that she was a girl as God made hera good
true womanly girlone of those sort of girls that only love once Tom
got on with her father who was packing horses through the ranges to the
new goldfieldsit was rough country and there were no roads they had
to pack everything there in those days and there was money in it The
girls father took to Tomas almost everybody else didand as far as
the girl was concerned I think it was a case of love at first sight
They only knew each other for about six months and were only courting
as they called it then for three or four months altogether but she
was that sort of girl that can love a man for six weeks and lose him for
ever and yet go on loving him to the end of her lifeand die with his
name on her lips

Well things were brightening up every way for Tom and he and his
sweetheart were beginning to talk about their own little home in future
when there came a letter from the Madeline girl in New South Wales

She was in terrible trouble Her baby was to be born in a month Her
people had kicked her out and she was in danger of starving She begged
and prayed of him to come back and marry her if only for his childs
sake He could go then and be free she would never trouble him any
moreonly come and marry her for the childs sake

The Oracle doesnt know where he lost that letter but I do It was
burnt afterwards by a woman who was more than a mother to him in his
troubleAunt Bob She thought he might carry it round with the rest of
his papers in his swag for years and come across it unexpectedly when
he was camped by himself in the bush and feeling dull It wouldnt have
done him any good then

He must have fought the hardest fight in his life when he got that
letter No doubt he walked to and fro to and fro all night with his
hands behind him and his eyes on the ground as he does now sometimes
Walking up and down helps you to fight a thing out

No doubt he thought of things pretty well as he thinks now the poor
girls shame on every tongue and belled round the district by every hag
in the township and she looked upon by women as being as bad as any
man who ever went to Bathurst in the old days handcuffed between two
troopers There is sympathy a pipe and tobacco a cheering word and
maybe a whisky now and then for the criminal on his journey but
there is no mercy at least as far as women are concerned for the
poor foolish girl who has to sneak out the back way and round by back
streets and lanes after dark with a cloak on to hide her figure

Tom sent what money he thought he could spare and next day he went to
the girl he loved and who loved him and told her the truth and showed
her the letter She was only a girlbut the sort of girl you COULD go
to in a crisis like that He had made up his mind to do the right thing
and she loved him all the more for it And so they parted

When Tom reached Pipeclay the girls relations that she was
stopping with had a parson readied up and they were married the same
day

And what happened after that asked Mitchell

Nothing happened for three or four months then the child was born It
wasnt his

Mitchell stood up with an oath

The girl was thoroughly bad Shed been carrying on with God knows how
many men both before and after she trapped Tom

And what did he do then

Well you know how the Oracle argues over things and I suppose he was
as big an old fool then as he is now He thinks that as most men would
deceive women if they could when one man gets caught hes got no call
to squeal about it hes bound because of the sins of men in general
against women to make the best of it What is one mans wrong counted
against the wrongs of hundreds of unfortunate girls

Its an uncommon way of arguinglike most of the Oracles ideasbut
it seems to look all right at first sight

Perhaps he thought shed go straight perhaps she convinced him that he
was the cause of her first fall anyway he stuck to her for more than
a year and intended to take her away from that place as soon as hed
scraped enough money together It might have gone on up till now if
the father of the childa big black Irishman named Redmondhadnt come
sneaking back at the end of a year Hewell he came hanging round Mrs
Marshall while Tom was away at workand she encouraged him And Tom was
forced to see it

Tom wanted to fight out his own battle without interference but the
chaps wouldnt let himthey reckoned that hed stand very little show
against Redmond who was a very rough customer and a fighting man My
uncle Bob who was there still fixed it up this way The Oracle was
to fight Redmond and if the Oracle got licked Uncle Bob was to take
Redmond on If Redmond whipped Uncle Bob that was to settle it but if
Uncle Bob thrashed Redmond then he was also to fight Redmonds
mate another big rough Paddy named Duigan Then the affair would be
finishedno matter which way the last bout went You see Uncle Bob was
reckoned more of a match for Redmond than the Oracle was so the thing
looked fair enoughat first sight

Redmond had his mate Duigan and one or two others of the rough gang
that used to terrorise the fields round there in the roaring days of
Gulgong The Oracle had Uncle Bob of course and long Dave Regan the
drovera goodhearted sawny kind of chap thatd break the devils
own buckjumper or smash him or get smashed himselfand little Jimmy
Nowlett the bullocky and one or two of the old betterclass diggers
that were left on the field

Theres a clear space among the saplings in Specimen Gully where they
used to pitch circuses and here in the cool of a summer evening the
two men stood face to face Redmond was a rough roaring foulmouthed
man he stripped to his shirt and roared like a bull and swore and
sneered and wanted to take the whole of Toms crowd while he was at it
and make one clean job of em Couldnt waste time fighting them all one
after the other because he wanted to get away to the new rush at Cattle
Creek next day The fool had been drinking shantywhisky

Tom stood up in his clean white moles and white flannel shirtone of
those sort with no sleeves that give the arms play He had a sort
of set expression and a look in his eyes that Uncle Bobnor none of
themhad ever seen there before Give us plenty ofroom roared
Redmond one of us is going to hell now This is going to be a fight
to afinish and ashort one And it was Joe paused

Go on said Mitchellgo on

Joe drew a long breath

The Oracle never got a mark He was topdog right from the start
Perhaps it was his strength that Redmond had underrated or his want
of science that puzzled him or the awful silence of the man that
frightened him it made even Uncle Bob uneasy Or perhaps it was
Providence it was a glorious chance for Providence but anyway as
I say the Oracle never got a mark except on his knuckles After a few
rounds Redmond funked and wanted to give in but the chaps wouldnt let
himnot even his own matesexcept Duigan They made him take it as
long as he could stand on his feet He even shammed to be knocked out
and roared out something about having broken hisanklebut it was
no use And the Oracle The chaps that knew thought that hed refuse to
fight and never hit a man that had given in But he did He just stood
there with that quiet look in his eyes and waited and when he did hit
there wasnt any necessity for Redmond to PRETEND to be knocked down
Youll see a glint of that old light in the Oracles eyes even now once
in a while and when you do its a sign that you or someone are going
too far and had better pull up for its a red light on the line old
as he is

Now Jimmy Nowlett was a nuggety little fellow hard as cast iron
goodhearted but very excitable and when the bashed Redmond was
being carted off poor Uncle Bob was always pretty highstrung and was
sitting on a log sobbing like a great child from the reaction Duigan
made some sneering remark that only Jimmy Nowlett caught and in an
instant he was up and at Duigan

Perhaps Duigan was demoralised by his mates defeat or by the
suddenness of the attack but at all events he got a hiding too
Uncle Bob used to say that it was the funniest thing he ever saw in his
life Jimmy kept yelling Let me get at him By the Lord let me get at
him And nobody was attempting to stop him he WAS getting at him all
the timeand properly too and when hed knocked Duigan down hed
dance round him and call on him to get up and every time he jumped or
bounced hed squeak like an indiarubber ball Uncle Bob said and he
would nearly burst his boiler trying to lug the big man on to his feet
sos he could knock him down again It took two of Jimmys mates all
their time to lam him down into a comparatively reasonable state of mind
after the fight was over

The Oracle left for Sydney next day and Uncle Bob went with him He
stayed at Uncle Bobs place for some time He got very quiet they said
and gentle he used to play with the children and they got mighty fond
of him The old folks thought his heart was broken but it went through
a deeper sorrow still after that and it aint broken yet It takes a lot
to break the heart of a man

And his wife asked Mitchellwhat became of her

I dont think he ever saw her again She dropped down pretty low after
he left herIve heard shes living somewhere quietly The Oracles
been sending someone money ever since I knew him and I know its a
woman I suppose its she He isnt the sort of a man to see a woman
starveespecially a woman he had ever had anything to do with

And the Gippsland girl asked Mitchell

Thats the worst part of it all I think The Oracle went up North
somewhere In the course of a year or two his affair got over Gippsland
way through a mate of his who lived over there and at last the story
got to the ears of this girl Bertha Bredt She must have written a
dozen letters to him Aunt Bob said She knew what was in em but of
course shed never tell us The Oracle only wrote one in reply Then
what must the girl do but clear out from home and make her way over to
Sydneyto Aunt Bobs place looking for Tom She never got any further
She took illbrainfever or broken heart or something of that sort
All the time she was down her cry wasI want to see him I want to
find Tom I only want to see Tom

When they saw she was dying Aunt Bob wired to the Oracle to comeand
he came When the girl saw it was Tom sitting by the bed she just gave
one long look in his face put her arms round his neck and laid her
head on his shoulderand died Here comes the Oracle now

Mitchell lifted the teabilly on to the coals

About the author



Henry Lawson was born near Grenfell New South Wales Australia on
17 June 1867 Although he has since become Australias most acclaimed
writer in his own lifetime his writing was often on the sidehis
real work being whatever he could find His writing was frequently
taken from memories of his childhood especially at PipeclayEurunderee
In his autobiography he states that many of his characters were
taken from the better class of diggers and bushmen he knew there
His experiences at this time deeply influenced his work for it is
interesting to note a number of descriptions and phrases that are
identical in his autobiography and in his stories and poems He died at
Sydney 2 September 1922 He is most famous for his short stories

On the Track and Over the Sliprails were both published at Sydney
in 1900 the prefaces being dated March and June respectivelyand so
though printed separately a combined edition was printed the same
year the two separate complete works were simply put together in one
binding hence they are sometimes referred to as On the Track and Over
the Sliprails The opposite occurred with Joe Wilson and His Mates
which was later divided into Joe Wilson and Joe Wilsons Mates
1901 All of these works are now online as well as one book of
Lawsons verse In the Days When the World was Wide 1896

 Also a hint with the seasonsremember that the seasons are
 reversed from those in the northern hemisphere hence June may be
 hot but December is even hotter Australia is at a lower latitude
 than the United States so the winters are not harsh by US
 standards and are not even mild in the north In fact large parts
 of Australia are governed more by dry versus wet than by Spring
 SummerFallWinter

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
