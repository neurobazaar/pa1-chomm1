AMOURS DE VOYAGE




Canto I


 Over the great windy waters and over the clearcrested summits
 Unto the sun and the sky and unto the perfecter earth
 Come let us goto a land wherein gods of the old time wandered
 Where every breath even now changes to ether divine
 Come let us go though withal a voice whisper The world that we live in
 Whithersoever we turn still is the same narrow crib
 Tis but to prove limitation and measure a cord that we travel
 Let who would scape and be free go to his chamber and think
 Tis but to change idle fancies for memories wilfully falser
 Tis but to go and have beenCome little bark let us go


 I Claude to Eustace

 Dear Eustatio I write that you may write me an answer
 Or at the least to put us again en rapport with each other
 Rome disappoints me muchSt Peters perhaps in especial
 Only the Arch of Titus and view from the Lateran please me
 This however perhaps is the weather which truly is horrid
 Greece must be better surely and yet I am feeling so spiteful
 That I could travel to Athens to Delphi and Troy and Mount Sinai
 Though but to see with my eyes that these are vanity also
 Rome disappoints me much I hardly as yet understand it but
 RUBBISHY seems the word that most exactly would suit it
 All the foolish destructions and all the sillier savings
 All the incongruous things of past incompatible ages
 Seem to be treasured up here to make fools of present and future
 Would to Heaven the old Goths had made a cleaner sweep of it
 Would to Heaven some new ones would come and destroy these churches
 However one can live in Rome as also in London
 It is a blessing no doubt to be rid at least for a time of
 All ones friends and relationsyourself forgive me included
 All the assujettissement of having been what one has been
 What one thinks one is or thinks that others suppose one
 Yet in despite of all we turn like fools to the English
 Vernon has been my fate who is here the same that you knew him
 Making the tour it seems with friends of the name of Trevellyn


 II Claude to Eustace

 Rome disappoints me still but I shrink and adapt myself to it
 Somehow a tyrannous sense of a superincumbent oppression
 Still wherever I go accompanies ever and makes me
 Feel like a tree shall I say buried under a ruin of brickwork
 Rome believe me my friend is like its own Monte Testaceo
 Merely a marvellous mass of broken and castaway winepots
 Ye gods what do I want with this rubbish of ages departed
 Things that Nature abhors the experiments that she has failed in
 What do I find in the Forum An archway and two or three pillars
 Well but St Peters Alas Bernini has filled it with sculpture
 No one can cavil I grant at the size of the great Coliseum
 Doubtless the notion of grand and capacious and massive amusement
 This the old Romans had but tell me is this an idea
 Yet of solidity much but of splendour little is extant
 Brickwork I found thee and marble I left thee their Emperor vaunted
 Marble I thought thee and brickwork I find thee the Tourist may answer


 III Georgina Trevellyn to Louisa 

 At last dearest Louisa I take up my pen to address you
 Here we are you see with the sevenandseventy boxes
 Courier Papa and Mamma the children and Mary and Susan
 Here we all are at Rome and delighted of course with St Peters
 And very pleasantly lodged in the famous Piazza di Spagna
 Rome is a wonderful place but Mary shall tell you about it
 Not very gay however the English are mostly at Naples
 There are the As we hear and most of the W party
 George however is come did I tell you about his mustachios
 Dear I must really stop for the carriage they tell me is waiting
 Mary will finish and Susan is writing they say to Sophia
 Adieu dearest Louiseevermore your faithful Georgina
 Who can a Mr Claude be whom George has taken to be with
 Very stupid I think but George says so VERY clever


 IV Claude to Eustace

 No the Christian faith as at any rate I understood it
 With its humiliations and exaltations combining
 Exaltations sublime and yet diviner abasements
 Aspirations from something most shameful here upon earth and
 In our poor selves to something most perfect above in the heavens
 No the Christian faith as I at least understood it
 Is not here O Rome in any of these thy churches
 Is not here but in Freiburg or Rheims or Westminster Abbey
 What in thy Dome I find in all thy recenter efforts
 Is a something I think more RATIONAL far more earthly
 Actual less ideal devout not in scorn and refusal
 But in a positive calm StoicEpicurean acceptance
 This I begin to detect in St Peters and some of the churches
 Mostly in all that I see of the sixteenthcentury masters
 Overlaid of course with infinite gauds and gewgaws
 Innocent playful follies the toys and trinkets of childhood
 Forced on maturer years as the serious one thing needful
 By the barbarian will of the rigid and ignorant Spaniard
 Curious work meantime reentering society how we
 Walk a livelong day great Heaven and watch our shadows
 What our shadows seem forsooth we will ourselves be
 Do I look like that you think me that then I AM that


 V Claude to Eustace

 Luther they say was unwise like a halftaught German he could not
 See that old follies were passing most tranquilly out of remembrance
 Leo the Tenth was employing all efforts to clear out abuses
 Jupiter Juno and Venus Fine Arts and Fine Letters the Poets
 Scholars and Sculptors and Painters were quietly clearing away the
 Martyrs and Virgins and Saints or at any rate Thomas Aquinas
 He must forsooth make a fuss and distend his huge Wittenberg lungs and
 Bring back Theology once yet again in a flood upon Europe
 Lo you for forty days from the windows of heaven it fell the
 Waters prevail on the earth yet more for a hundred and fifty
 Are they abating at last the doves that are sent to explore are
 Wearily fain to return at the best with a leaflet of promise
 Fain to return as they went to the wandering wavetost vessel
 Fain to reenter the roof which covers the clean and the unclean
 Luther they say was unwise he didnt see how things were going
 Luther was foolishbut O great God what call you Ignatius
 O my tolerant soul be still but you talk of barbarians
 Alaric Attila Gensericwhy they came they killed they
 Ravaged and went on their way but these vile tyrannous Spaniards
 These are here stillhow long O ye heavens in the country of Dante
 These that fanaticized Europe which now can forget them release not
 This their choicest of prey this Italy here you see them
 Here with emasculate pupils and gimcrack churches of Gesu
 Pseudolearning and lies confessionalboxes and postures
 Here with metallic beliefs and regimental devotions
 Here overcrusting with slime perverting defacing debasing
 Michael Angelos Dome that had hung the Pantheon in heaven
 Raphaels Joys and Graces and thy clear stars Galileo


 VI Claude to Eustace

 Which of three Misses Trevellyn it is that Vernon shall marry
 Is not a thing to be known for our friend is one of those natures
 Which have their perfect delight in the general tenderdomestic
 So that he trifles with Marys shawl ties Susans bonnet
 Dances with all but at home is most they say with Georgina
 Who is however TOO silly in my apprehension for Vernon
 I as before when I wrote continue to see them a little
 Not that I like them much or care a bajocco for Vernon
 But I am slow at Italian have not many English acquaintance
 And I am asked in short and am not good at excuses
 Middleclass people these bankers very likely not wholly
 Pure of the taint of the shop will at table dhote and restaurant
 Have their shillings worth their pennys pennyworth even
 Neither mans aristocracy this nor Gods God knoweth
 Yet they are fairly descended they give you to know well connected
 Doubtless somewhere in some neighbourhood have and are careful to keep some
 Threadbaregenteel relations who in their turn are enchanted
 Grandly among county people to introduce at assemblies
 To the unpennied cadets our cousins with excellent fortunes
 Neither mans aristocracy this nor Gods God knoweth


 VII Claude to Eustace

 Ah what a shame indeed to abuse these most worthy people
 Ah what a sin to have sneered at their innocent rustic pretensions
 Is it not laudable really this reverent worship of station
 Is it not fitting that wealth should tender this homage to culture
 Is it not touching to witness these efforts if little availing
 Painfully made to perform the old ritual service of manners
 Shall not devotion atone for the absence of knowledge and fervour
 Palliate cover the fault of a superstitious observance
 Dear dear what do I say but alas just now like Iago
 I can be nothing at all if it is not critical wholly
 So in fantastic height in coxcomb exaltation
 Here in the garden I walk can freely concede to the Maker
 That the works of His hand are all very good His creatures
 Beast of the field and fowl He brings them before me I name them
 That which I name them they arethe bird the beast and the cattle
 But for Adamalas poor critical coxcomb Adam
 But for Adam there is not found an helpmeet for him


 VIII Claude to Eustace

 No great Dome of Agrippa thou art not Christian canst not
 Strip and replaster and daub and do what they will with thee be so
 Here underneath the great porch of colossal Corinthian columns
 Here as I walk do I dream of the Christian belfries above them
 Or on a bench as I sit and abide for long hours till thy whole vast
 Round grows dim as in dreams to my eyes I repeople thy niches
 Not with the Martyrs and Saints and Confessors and Virgins and children
 But with the mightier forms of an older austerer worship
 And I recite to myself how
 Eager for battle here
 Stood Vulcan here matronal Juno
 And with the bow to his shoulder faithful
 He who with pure dew laveth of Castaly
 His flowing locks who holdeth of Lycia
 The oak forest and the wood that bore him
 Delos and Pataras own Apollo 

  Hic avidus stetit
 Vulcanus hic matrona Juno et
 Nunquam humeris positurus arcum
 Qui rore puro Castaliae lavit
 Crines solutos qui Lyciae tenet
 Dumeta natalemque silvam
 Delius et Patareus Apollo


 IX Claude to Eustace

 Yet it is pleasant I own it to be in their company pleasant
 Whatever else it may be to abide in the feminine presence
 Pleasant but wrong will you say But this happy serene coexistence
 Is to some poor soft souls I fear a necessity simple
 Meat and drink and life and music filling with sweetness
 Thrilling with melody sweet with harmonies strange overwhelming
 All the longsilent strings of an awkward meaningless fabric
 Yet as for that I could live I believe with children to have those
 Pure and delicate forms encompassing moving about you
 This were enough I could think and truly with glad resignation
 Could from the dream of Romance from the fever of flushed adolescence
 Look to escape and subside into peaceful avuncular functions
 Nephews and nieces alas for as yet I have none and moreover
 Mothers are jealous I fear me too often too rightfully fathers
 Think they have title exclusive to spoiling their own little darlings
 And by the law of the land in despite of Malthusian doctrine
 No sort of proper provision is made for that most patriotic
 Most meritorious subject the childless and bachelor uncle


 X Claude to Eustace

 Ye too marvellous Twain that erect on the Monte Cavallo
 Stand by your rearing steeds in the grace of your motionless movement
 Stand with your upstretched arms and tranquil regardant faces
 Stand as instinct with life in the might of immutable manhood
 O ye mighty and strange ye ancient divine ones of Hellas
 Are ye Christian too to convert and redeem and renew you
 Will the brief form have sufficed that a Pope has set up on the apex
 Of the Egyptian stone that oertops you the Christian symbol
 And ye silent supreme in serene and victorious marble
 Ye that encircle the walls of the stately Vatican chambers
 Juno and Ceres Minerva Apollo the Muses and Bacchus
 Ye unto whom far and near come posting the Christian pilgrims
 Ye that are ranged in the halls of the mystic Christian Pontiff
 Are ye also baptized are ye of the kingdom of Heaven
 Utter O some one the word that shall reconcile Ancient and Modern
 Am I to turn me from this unto thee great Chapel of Sixtus


 XI Claude to Eustace

 These are the facts The uncle the elder brother the squire a
 Little embarrassed I fancy resides in the family place in
 Cornwall of course Papa is in business Mary informs me
 Hes a good sensible man whatever his trade is The mother
 Isshall I call it fineherself she would tell you refined and
 Greatly I fear me looks down on my bookish and maladroit manners
 Somewhat affecteth the blue would talk to me often of poets
 Quotes which I hate Childe Harold but also appreciates Wordsworth
 Sometimes adventures on Schiller and then to religion diverges
 Questions me much about Oxford and yet in her loftiest flights still
 Grates the fastidious ear with the slightly mercantile accent

 Is it contemptible EustaceIm perfectly ready to think so
 Is itthe horrible pleasure of pleasing inferior people
 I am ashamed of my own self and yet true it is if disgraceful
 That for the first time in life I am living and moving with freedom
 I who never could talk to the people I meet with my uncle
 I who have always failedI trust me can suit the Trevellyns
 I believe megreat conquest am liked by the country bankers
 And I am glad to be liked and like in return very kindly
 So it proceeds laissez faire laissez allersuch is the watchword
 Well I know there are thousands as pretty and hundreds as pleasant
 Girls by the dozen as good and girls in abundance with polish
 Higher and manners more perfect than Susan or Mary Trevellyn
 Well I know after all it is only juxtaposition
 Juxtaposition in short and what is juxtaposition


 XII Claude to Eustace

 But I am in for it nowlaissez faire of a truth laissez aller
 Yes I am goingI feel it I feel and cannot recall it
 Fusing with this thing and that entering into all sorts of relations
 Tying I know not what ties which whatever they are I know one thing
 Will and must woe is me be one day painfully broken
 Broken with painful remorses with shrinkings of soul and relentings
 Foolish delays more foolish evasions most foolish renewals
 But I have made the step have quitted the ship of Ulysses
 Quitted the sea and the shore passed into the magical island
 Yet on my lips is the moly medicinal offered of Hermes
 I have come into the precinct the labyrinth closes around me
 Path into path rounding slyly I pace slowly on and the fancy
 Struggling awhile to sustain the long sequences weary bewildered
 Fain must collapse in despair I yield I am lost and know nothing
 Yet in my bosom unbroken remaineth the clue I shall use it
 Lo with the rope on my loins I descend through the fissure I sink yet
 Inly secure in the strength of invisible arms up above me
 Still wheresoever I swing wherever to shore or to shelf or
 Floor of cavern untrodden shell sprinkled enchanting I know I
 Yet shall one time feel the strong cord tighten about me
 Feel it relentless upbear me from spots I would rest in and though the
 Rope sway wildly I faint crags wound me from crag unto crag re
 Bounding or wide in the void I die ten deaths ere the end I
 Yet shall plant firm foot on the broad lofty spaces I quit shall
 Feel underneath me again the great massy strengths of abstraction
 Look yet abroad from the height oer the sea whose salt wave I have tasted


 XIII Georgina Trevellyn to Louisa 

 Dearest LouisaInquire if you please about Mr Claude 
 He has been once at R and remembers meeting the Hs
 Harriet L perhaps may be able to tell you about him
 It is an awkward youth but still with very good manners
 Not without prospects we hear and George says highly connected
 Georgy declares it absurd but Mamma is alarmed and insists he has
 Taken up strange opinions and may be turning a Papist
 Certainly once he spoke of a daily service he went to
 Where we asked and he laughed and answered At the Pantheon
 This was a temple you know and now is a Catholic church and
 Though it is said that Mazzini has sold it for Protestant service
 Yet I suppose this change can hardly as yet be effected
 Adieu againevermore my dearest your loving Georgina

 PS by Mary Trevellyn

 I am to tell you you say what I think of our last new acquaintance
 Well then I think that George has a very fair right to be jealous
 I do not like him much though I do not dislike being with him
 He is what people call I suppose a superior man and
 Certainly seems so to me but I think he is terribly selfish


 

 Alba thou findest me still and Alba thou findest me ever
 Now from the Capitol steps now over Tituss Arch
 Here from the large grassy spaces that spread from the Lateran portal
 Towering oer aqueduct lines lost in perspective between
 Or from a Vatican window or bridge or the high Coliseum
 Clear by the garlanded line cut of the Flavian ring
 Beautiful can I not call thee and yet thou hast power to oermaster
 Power of mere beauty in dreams Alba thou hauntest me still
 Is it religion I ask me or is it a vain superstition
 Slavery abject and gross service too feeble of truth
 Is it an idol I bow to or is it a god that I worship
 Do I sink back on the old or do I soar from the mean
 So through the city I wander and question unsatisfied ever
 Reverent so I accept doubtful because I revere




Canto II


 Is it illusion or does there a spirit from perfecter ages
 Here even yet amid loss change and corruption abide
 Does there a spirit we know not though seek though we find comprehend not
 Here to entice and confuse tempt and evade us abide
 Lives in the exquisite grace of the column disjointed and single
 Haunts the rude masses of brick garlanded gaily with vine
 Een in the turret fantastic surviving that springs from the ruin
 Een in the people itself is it illusion or not
 Is it illusion or not that attracteth the pilgrim transalpine
 Brings him a dullard and dunce hither to pry and to stare
 Is it illusion or not that allures the barbarian stranger
 Brings him with gold to the shrine brings him in arms to the gate


 I Claude to Eustace

 What do the people say and what does the government doyou
 Ask and I know not at all Yet fortune will favour your hopes and
 I who avoided it all am fated it seems to describe it
 I who nor meddle nor make in politicsI who sincerely
 Put not my trust in leagues nor any suffrage by ballot
 Never predicted Parisian millenniums never beheld a
 New Jerusalem coming down dressed like a bride out of heaven
 Right on the Place de la ConcordeI nevertheless let me say it
 Could in my soul of souls this day with the Gaul at the gates shed
 One true tear for thee thou poor little Roman Republic
 What with the German restored with Sicily safe to the Bourbon
 Not leave one poor corner for native Italian exertion
 France it is foully done and you poor foolish England
 You who a twelvemonth ago said nations must choose for themselves you
 Could not of course interfereyou now when a nation has chosen
 Pardon this folly The Times will of course have announced the occasion
 Told you the news of today and although it was slightly in error
 When it proclaimed as a fact the Apollo was sold to a Yankee
 You may believe when it tells you the French are at Civita Vecchia


 II Claude to Eustace

 Dulce it is and decorum no doubt for the country to fallto
 Offer ones blood an oblation to Freedom and die for the Cause yet
 Still individual culture is also something and no man
 Finds quite distinct the assurance that he of all others is called on
 Or would be justified even in taking away from the world that
 Precious creature himself Nature sent him here to abide here
 Else why send him at all Nature wants him still it is likely
 On the whole we are meant to look after ourselves it is certain
 Each has to eat for himself digest for himself and in general
 Care for his own dear life and see to his own preservation
 Natures intentions in most things uncertain in this are decisive
 Which on the whole I conjecture the Romans will follow and I shall
 So we cling to our rocks like limpets Ocean may bluster
 Over and under and round us we open our shells to imbibe our
 Nourishment close them again and are safe fulfilling the purpose
 Nature intendeda wise one of course and a noble we doubt not
 Sweet it may be and decorous perhaps for the country to die but
 On the whole we conclude the Romans wont do it and I shant


 III Claude to Eustace

 Will they fight They say so And will the French I can hardly
 Hardly think so and yetHe is come they say to Palo
 He is passed from Monterone at Santa Severa
 He hath laid up his guns But the Virgin the Daughter of Roma
 She hath despised thee and laughed thee to scornThe Daughter of Tiber
 She hath shaken her head and built barricades against thee
 Will they fight I believe it Alas tis ephemeral folly
 Vain and ephemeral folly of course compared with pictures
 Statues and antique gemsIndeed and yet indeed too
 Yet methought in broad day did I dreamtell it not in St Jamess
 Whisper it not in thy courts O Christ Churchyet did I waking
 Dream of a cadence that sings Si tombent nos jeunes heros la
 Terre en produit de nouveaux contre vous tous prets a se battre
 Dreamt of great indignations and angers transcendental
 Dreamt of a sword at my side and a battlehorse underneath me


 IV Claude to Eustace

 Now supposing the French or the Neapolitan soldier
 Should by some evil chance come exploring the Maison Serny
 Where the family English are all to assemble for safety
 Am I prepared to lay down my life for the British female
 Really who knows One has bowed and talked till little by little
 All the natural heat has escaped of the chivalrous spirit
 Oh one conformed of course but one doesnt die for good manners
 Stab or shoot or be shot by way of graceful attention
 No if it should be at all it should be on the barricades there
 Should I incarnadine ever this inky pacifical finger
 Sooner far should it be for this vapour of Italys freedom
 Sooner far by the side of the dd and dirty plebeians
 Ah for a child in the street I could strike for the fullblown lady
 Somehow Eustace alas I have not felt the vocation
 Yet these people of course will expect as of course my protection
 Vernon in radiant arms stand forth for the lovely Georgina
 And to appear I suppose were but common civility Yes and
 Truly I do not desire they should either be killed or offended
 Oh and of course you will say When the time comes you will be ready
 Ah but before it comes am I to presume it will be so
 What I cannot feel now am I to suppose that I shall feel
 Am I not free to attend for the ripe and indubious instinct
 Am I forbidden to wait for the clear and lawful perception
 Is it the calling of man to surrender his knowledge and insight
 For the mere venture of what may perhaps be the virtuous action
 Must we walking our earth discerning a little and hoping
 Some plain visible task shall yet for our hands be assigned us
 Must we abandon the future for fear of omitting the present
 Quit our own fireside hopes at the alien call of a neighbour
 To the mere possible shadow of Deity offer the victim
 And is all this my friend but a weak and ignoble refining
 Wholly unworthy the head or the heart of Your Own Correspondent


 V Claude to Eustace

 Yes we are fighting at last it appears This morning as usual
 Murray as usual in hand I enter the Caffe Nuovo
 Seating myself with a sense as it were of a change in the weather
 Not understanding however but thinking mostly of Murray
 And for today is their day of the Campidoglio Marbles
 Caffelatte I call to the waiterand Non ce latte
 This is the answer he makes me and this is the sign of a battle
 So I sit and truly they seem to think any one else more
 Worthy than me of attention I wait for my milkless nero
 Free to observe undistracted all sorts and sizes of persons
 Blending civilian and soldier in strangest costume coming in and
 Gulping in hottest haste still standing their coffeewithdrawing
 Eagerly jangling a sword on the steps or jogging a musket
 Slung to the shoulder behind They are fewer moreover than usual
 Much and silenter far and so I begin to imagine
 Something is really afloat Ere I leave the Caffe is empty
 Empty too the streets in all its length the Corso
 Empty and empty I see to my right and left the Condotti
 Twelve oclock on the Pincian Hill with lots of English
 Germans Americans Frenchthe Frenchmen too are protected
 So we stand in the sun but afraid of a probable shower
 So we stand and stare and see to the left of St Peters
 Smoke from the cannon whitebut that is at intervals only
 Black from a burning house we suppose by the Cavalleggieri
 And we believe we discern some lines of men descending
 Down through the vineyardslopes and catch a bayonet gleaming
 Every ten minutes howeverin this there is no misconception
 Comes a great white puff from behind Michel Angelos dome and
 After a space the report of a real big gunnot the Frenchmans
 That must be doing some work And so we watch and conjecture
 Shortly an Englishman comes who says he has been to St Peters
 Seen the Piazza and troops but that is all he can tell us
 So we watch and sit and indeed it begins to be tiresome
 All this smoke is outside when it has come to the inside
 It will be time perhaps to descend and retreat to our houses
 Halfpast one or two The report of small arms frequent
 Sharp and savage indeed that cannot all be for nothing
 So we watch and wonder but guessing is tiresome very
 Weary of wondering watching and guessing and gossiping idly
 Down I go and pass through the quiet streets with the knots of
 National Guards patrolling and flags hanging out at the windows
 English American Danishand after offering to help an
 Irish family moving en masse to the Maison Serny
 After endeavouring idly to minister balm to the trembling
 Quinquagenarian fears of two lone British spinsters
 Go to make sure of my dinner before the enemy enter
 But by this there are signs of stragglers returning and voices
 Talk though you dont believe it of guns and prisoners taken
 And on the walls you read the first bulletin of the morning
 This is all that I saw and all that I know of the battle


 VI Claude to Eustace

 Victory VictoryYes ah yes thou republican Zion
 Truly the kings of the earth are gathered and gone by together
 Doubtless they marvelled to witness such things were astonished and so forth
 Victory Victory VictoryAh but it is believe me
 Easier easier far to intone the chant of the martyr
 Than to indite any paean of any victory Death may
 Sometimes be noble but life at the best will appear an illusion
 While the great pain is upon us it is great when it is over
 Why it is over The smoke of the sacrifice rises to heaven
 Of a sweet savour no doubt to Somebody but on the altar
 Lo there is nothing remaining but ashes and dirt and ill odour
 So it stands you perceive the labial muscles that swelled with
 Vehement evolution of yesterday Marseillaises
 Articulations sublime of defiance and scorning today col
 Lapse and languidly mumble while men and women and papers
 Scream and rescream to each other the chorus of Victory Well but
 I am thankful they fought and glad that the Frenchmen were beaten


 VII Claude to Eustace

 So I have seen a man killed An experience that among others
 Yes I suppose I have although I can hardly be certain
 And in a court of justice could never declare I had seen it
 But a man was killed I am told in a place where I saw
 Something a man was killed I am told and I saw something
 I was returning home from St Peters Murray as usual
 Under my arm I remember had crossed the St Angelo bridge and
 Moving towards the Condotti had got to the first barricade when
 Gradually thinking still of St Peters I became conscious
 Of a sensation of movement opposing metendency this way
 Such as one fancies may be in a stream when the wave of the tide is
 Coming and not yet comea sort of noise and retention
 So I turned and before I turned caught sight of stragglers
 Heading a crowd it is plain that is coming behind that corner
 Looking up I see windows filled with heads the Piazza
 Into which you remember the Ponte St Angelo enters
 Since I passed has thickened with curious groups and now the
 Crowd is coming has turned has crossed that last barricade is
 Here at my side In the middle they drag at something What is it
 Ha bare swords in the air held up There seem to be voices
 Pleading and hands putting back official perhaps but the swords are
 Many and bare in the air In the air they descend they are smiting
 Hewing choppingAt what In the air once more upstretched And
 Is it blood thats on them Yes certainly blood Of whom then
 Over whom is the cry of this furor of exultation
 While they are skipping and screaming and dancing their caps on the points of
 Swords and bayonets I to the outskirts back and ask a
 Mercantileseeming bystander What is it and he looking always
 That way makes me answer A Priest who was trying to fly to
 The Neapolitan armyand thus explains the proceeding
 You didnt see the dead man NoI began to be doubtful
 I was in black myself and didnt know what mightnt happen
 But a National Guard close by me outside of the hubbub
 Broke his sword with slashing a broad hat covered with dustand
 Passing away from the place with Murray under my arm and
 Stooping I saw through the legs of the people the legs of a body
 You are the first do you know to whom I have mentioned the matter
 Whom should I tell it to elsethese girlsthe Heavens forbid it
 Quidnuncs at MonaldinisIdlers upon the Pincian
 If I rightly remember it happened on that afternoon when
 Word of the nearer approach of a new Neapolitan army
 First was spread I began to bethink me of Paris Septembers
 Thought I could fancy the look of that old Ninetytwo On that evening
 Three or four or it may be five of these people were slaughtered
 Some declared they had one of them fired on a sentinel others
 Say they were only escaping a Priest it is currently stated
 Stabbed a National Guard on the very Piazza Colonna
 History Rumour of Rumours I leave to thee to determine
 But I am thankful to say the government seems to have strength to
 Put it down it has vanished at least the place is most peaceful
 Through the Trastevere walking last night at nine of the clock I
 Found no sort of disorder I crossed by the Islandbridges
 So by the narrow streets to the Ponte Rotto and onwards
 Thence by the Temple of Vesta away to the great Coliseum
 Which at the full of the moon is an object worthy a visit


 VIII Georgina Trevellyn to Louisa 

 Only think dearest Louisa what fearful scenes we have witnessed
        
 George has just seen Garibaldi dressed up in a long white cloak on
 Horseback riding by with his mounted negro behind him
 This is a man you know who came from America with him
 Out of the woods I suppose and uses a lasso in fighting
 Which is I dont quite know but a sort of noose I imagine
 This he throws on the heads of the enemys men in a battle
 Pulls them into his reach and then most cruelly kills them
 Mary does not believe but we heard it from an Italian
 Mary allows she was wrong about Mr Claude BEING SELFISH
 He was MOST useful and kind on the terrible thirtieth of April
 Do not write here any more we are starting directly for Florence
 We should be off tomorrow if only Papa could get horses
 All have been seized everywhere for the use of this dreadful Mazzini

 PS
 Mary has seen thus farI am really so angry Louisa
 Quite out of patience my dearest What can the man be intending
 I am quite tired and Mary who might bring him to in a moment
 Lets him go on as he likes and neither will help nor dismiss him


 IX Claude to Eustace

 It is most curious to see what a power a few calm words in
 Merely a brief proclamation appear to possess on the people
 Order is perfect and peace the city is utterly tranquil
 And one cannot conceive that this easy and nonchalant crowd that
 Flows like a quiet stream through street and marketplace entering
 Shady recesses and bays of church osteria and caffe
 Could in a moment be changed to a flood as of molten lava
 Boil into deadly wrath and wild homicidal delusion
 Ah tis an excellent raceand even in old degradation
 Under a rule that enforces to flattery lying and cheating
 Een under Pope and Priest a nice and natural people
 Oh could they but be allowed this chance of redemptionbut clearly
 That is not likely to be Meantime notwithstanding all journals
 Honour for once to the tongue and the pen of the eloquent writer
 Honour to speech and all honour to thee thou noble Mazzini


 X Claude to Eustace

 I am in love meantime you think no doubt you would think so
 I am in love you say with those letters of course you would say so
 I am in love you declare I think not so yet I grant you
 It is a pleasure indeed to converse with this girl Oh rare gift
 Rare felicity this she can talk in a rational way can
 Speak upon subjects that really are matters of mind and of thinking
 Yet in perfection retain her simplicity never one moment
 Never however you urge it however you tempt her consents to
 Step from ideas and fancies and loving sensations to those vain
 Conscious understandings that vex the minds of mankind
 No though she talk it is music her fingers desert not the keys tis
 Song though you hear in the song the articulate vocables sounded
 Syllabled singly and sweetly the words of melodious meaning
 I am in love you say I do not think so exactly


 XI Claude to Eustace

 There are two different kinds I believe of human attraction
 One which simply disturbs unsettles and makes you uneasy
 And another that poises retains and fixes and holds you
 I have no doubt for myself in giving my voice for the latter
 I do not wish to be moved but growing where I was growing
 There more truly to grow to live where as yet I had languished
 I do not like being moved for the will is excited and action
 Is a most dangerous thing I tremble for something factitious
 Some malpractice of heart and illegitimate process
 We are so prone to these things with our terrible notions of duty


 XII Claude to Eustace

 Ah let me look let me watch let me wait unhurried unprompted
 Bid me not venture on aught that could alter or end what is present
 Say not Time flies and Occasion that never returns is departing
 Drive me not out yet ye ill angels with fiery swords from my Eden
 Waiting and watching and looking Let love be its own inspiration
 Shall not a voice if a voice there must be from the airs that environ
 Yea from the conscious heavens without our knowledge or effort
 Break into audible words And love be its own inspiration


 XIII Claude to Eustace

 Wherefore and how I am certain I hardly can tell but it IS so
 She doesnt like me Eustace I think she never will like me
 Is it my fault as it is my misfortune my ways are not her ways
 Is it my fault that my habits and modes are dissimilar wholly
 Tis not her fault tis her nature her virtue to misapprehend them
 Tis not her fault tis her beautiful nature not ever to know me
 Hopeless it seemsyet I cannot though hopeless determine to leave it
 She goestherefore I go she movesI move not to lose her


 XIV Claude to Eustace

 Oh tisnt manly of course tisnt manly this method of wooing
 Tisnt the way very likely to win For the woman they tell you
 Ever prefers the audacious the wilful the vehement hero
 She has no heart for the timid the sensitive soul and for knowledge
 Knowledge O ye Godswhen did they appreciate knowledge
 Wherefore should they either I am sure I do not desire it
 Ah and I feel too Eustace she cares not a tittle about me
 Care about me indeed and do I really expect it
 But my manner offends my ways are wholly repugnant
 Every word that I utter estranges hurts and repels her
 Every moment of bliss that I gain in her exquisite presence
 Slowly surely withdraws her removes her and severs her from me
 Not that I care very muchany way I escape from the boys own
 Folly to which I am prone of loving where it is easy
 Not that I mind very much Why should I I am not in love and
 Am prepared I think if not by previous habit
 Yet in the spirit beforehand for this and all that is like it
 It is an easier matter for us contemplative creatures
 Us upon whom the pressure of action is laid so lightly
 We discontented indeed with things in particular idle
 Sickly complaining by faith in the vision of things in general
 Manage to hold on our way without like others around us
 Seizing the nearest arm to comfort help and support us
 Yet after all my Eustace I know but little about it
 All I can say for myself for present alike and for past is
 Mary Trevellyn Eustace is certainly worth your acquaintance
 You couldnt come I suppose as far as Florence to see her


 XV Georgina Trevellyn to Louisa 

  Tomorrow were starting for Florence
 Truly rejoiced you may guess to escape from republican terrors
 Mr C and Papa to escort us we by vettura
 Through Siena and Georgy to follow and join us by Leghorn
 Then Ah what shall I say my dearest I tremble in thinking
 You will imagine my feelingsthe blending of hope and of sorrow
 How can I bear to abandon Papa and Mamma and my Sisters
 Dearest Louise indeed it is very alarming but trust me
 Ever whatever may change to remain your loving Georgina

 PS by Mary Trevellyn

  Do I like Mr Claude any better
 I am to tell youand Pray is it Susan or I that attract him
 This he never has told but Georgina could certainly ask him
 All I can say for myself is alas that he rather repels me
 There I think him agreeable but also a little repulsive
 So be content dear Louisa for one satisfactory marriage
 Surely will do in one year for the family you would establish
 Neither Susan nor I shall afford you the joy of a second

 PS by Georgina Trevellyn

 Mr Claude you must know is behaving a little bit better
 He and Papa are great friends but he really is too SHILLYSHALLY
 So unlike George Yet I hope that the matte is going on fairly
 I shall however get George before he goes to say something
 Dearest Louise how delightful to bring young people together


 

 Is it Florence we follow or are we to tarry yet longer
 Een amid clamour of arms here in the city of old
 Seeking from clamour of arms in the Past and the Arts to be hidden
 Vainly mid Arts and the Past seeking one life to forget
 Ah fair shadow scarce seen go forth for anon he shall follow
 He that beheld thee anon whither thou leadest must go
 Go and the wise loving Muse she also will follow and find thee
 She should she linger in Rome were not dissevered from thee




Canto III



 Yet to the wondrous St Peters and yet to the solemn Rotunda
 Mingling with heroes and gods yet to the Vatican Walls
 Yet may we go and recline while a whole mighty world seems above us
 Gathered and fixed to all time into one roofing supreme
 Yet may we thinking on these things exclude what is meaner around us
 Yet at the worst of the worst books and a chamber remain
 Yet may we think and forget and possess our souls in resistance
 Ah but away from the stir shouting and gossip of war
 Where upon Apennine slope with the chestnut the oaktrees immingle
 Where amid odorous copse bridlepaths wander and wind
 Where under mulberrybranches the diligent rivulet sparkles
 Or amid cotton and maize peasants their waterworks ply
 Where over figtree and orange in tier upon tier still repeated
 Garden on garden upreared balconies step to the sky
 Ah that I were far away from the crowd and the streets of the city
 Under the vinetrellis laid O my beloved with thee


 I Mary Trevellyn to Miss Roperon the way to Florence

 Why doesnt Mr Claude come with us you askWe dont know
 You should know better than we He talked of the Vatican marbles
 But I cant wholly believe that this was the actual reason
 He was so ready before when we asked him to come and escort us
 Certainly he is odd my dear Miss Roper To change so
 Suddenly just for a whim was not quite fair to the party
 Not quite right I declare I really almost am offended
 I his great friend as you say have doubtless a title to be so
 Not that I greatly regret it for dear Georgina distinctly
 Wishes for nothing so much as to show her adroitness But oh my
 Pen will not write any morelet us say nothing further about it
        
 Yes my dear Miss Roper I certainly called him repulsive
 So I think him but cannot be sure I have used the expression
 Quite as your pupil should yet he does most truly repel me
 Was it to you I made use of the word or who was it told you
 Yes repulsive observe it is but when he talks of ideas
 That he is quite unaffected and free and expansive and easy
 I could pronounce him simply a cold intellectual being
 When does he make advancesHe thinks that women should woo him
 Yet if a girl should do so would be but alarmed and disgusted
 She that should love him must look for small love in returnlike the ivy
 On the stone wall must expect but a rigid and niggard support and
 Een to get that must go searching all round with her humble embraces


 II Claude to Eustacefrom Rome

 Tell me my friend do you think that the grain would sprout in the furrow
 Did it not truly accept as its summum and ultimum bonum
 That mere common and maybe indifferent soil it is set in
 Would it have force to develop and open its young cotyledons
 Could it compare and reflect and examine one thing with another
 Would it endure to accomplish the round of its natural functions
 Were it endowed with a sense of the general scheme of existence
 While from Marseilles in the steamer we voyage to Civita Vecchia
 Vexed in the squally seas as we lay by Capraja and Elba
 Standing uplifted alone on the heaving poop of the vessel
 Looking around on the waste of the rushing incurious billows
 This is Nature I said we are born as it were from her waters
 Over her billows that buffet and beat us her offspring uncaredfor
 Casting one single regard of a painful victorious knowledge
 Into her billows that buffet and beat us we sink and are swallowed
 This was the sense in my soul as I swayed with the poop of the steamer
 And as unthinking I sat in the hall of the famed Ariadne
 Lo it looked at me there from the face of a Triton in marble
 It is the simpler thought and I can believe it the truer
 Let us not talk of growth we are still in our Aqueous Ages


 III Claude to Eustace

 Farewell Politics utterly What can I do I cannot
 Fight you know and to talk I am wholly ashamed And although I
 Gnash my teeth when I look in your French or your English papers
 What is the good of that Will swearing I wonder mend matters
 Cursing and scolding repel the assailants No it is idle
 No whatever befalls I will hide will ignore or forget it
 Let the tail shift for itself I will bury my head And whats the
 Roman Republic to me or I to the Roman Republic
 Why not fightIn the first place I havent so much as a musket
 In the next if I had I shouldnt know how I should use it
 In the third just at present Im studying ancient marbles
 In the fourth I consider I owe my life to my country
 In the fifthI forget but four good reasons are ample
 Meantime pray let em fight and be killed I delight in devotion
 So that I list not hurrah for the glorious army of martyrs
 Sanguis martyrum semen Ecclesiae though it would seem this
 Church is indeed of the purely Invisible Kingdomcome kind
 Militant here on earth Triumphant of course then elsewhere
 Ah good Heaven but I would I were out far away from the pother


 IV Claude to Eustace

 Not as we read in the words of the oldentime inspiration
 Are there two several trees in the place we are set to abide in
 But on the apex most high of the Tree of Life in the Garden
 Budding unfolding and falling decaying and flowering ever
 Flowering is set and decaying the transient blossom of Knowledge
 Flowering alone and decaying the needless unfruitful blossom
 Or as the cypressspires by the fairflowing stream Hellespontine
 Which from the mythical tomb of the godlike Protesilaus
 Rose sympathetic in grief to his lovelorn Laodamia
 Evermore growing and when in their growth to the prospect attaining
 Over the low seabanks of the fatal Ilian city
 Withering still at the sight which still they upgrow to encounter
 Ah but ye that extrude from the ocean your helpless faces
 Ye over stormy seas leading long and dreary processions
 Ye too brood of the wind whose coming is whence we discern not
 Making your nest on the wave and your bed on the crested billow
 Skimming rough waters and crowding wet sands that the tide shall return to
 Cormorants ducks and gulls fill ye my imagination
 Let us not talk of growth we are still in our Aqueous Ages


 V Mary Trevellyn to Miss Roperfrom Florence

 Dearest Miss RoperAlas we are all at Florence quite safe and
 You we hear are shut up indeed it is sadly distressing
 We were most lucky they say to get off when we did from the troubles
 Now you are really besieged they tell us it soon will be over
 Only I hope and trust without any fight in the city
 Do you see Mr ClaudeI thought he might do something for you
 I am quite sure on occasion he really would wish to be useful
 What is he doing I wonderstill studying Vatican marbles
 Letters I hope pass through We trust your brother is better


 VI Claude to Eustace

 Juxtaposition in fine and what is juxtaposition
 Look you we travel along in the railwaycarriage or steamer
 And pour passer le temps till the tedious journey be ended
 Lay aside paper or book to talk with the girl that is next one
 And pour passer le temps with the terminus all but in prospect
 Talk of eternal ties and marriages made in heaven
 Ah did we really accept with a perfect heart the illusion
 Ah did we really believe that the Present indeed is the Only
 Or through all transmutation all shock and convulsion of passion
 Feel we could carry undimmed unextinguished the light of our knowledge
 But for his funeral train which the bridegroom sees in the distance
 Would he so joyfully think you fall in with the marriage procession
 But for that final discharge would he dare to enlist in that service
 But for that certain release ever sign to that perilous contract
 But for that exit secure ever bend to that treacherous doorway
 Ah but the bride meantimedo you think she sees it as he does
 But for the steady foresense of a freer and larger existence
 Think you that man could consent to be circumscribed here into action
 But for assurance within a limitless ocean divine oer
 Whose great tranquil depths unconscious the windtost surface
 Breaks into ripples of trouble that come and change and endure not
 But that in this of a truth we have our being and know it
 Think you we men could submit to live and move as we do here
 Ah but the womenGod bless them they dont think at all about it
 Yet we must eat and drink as you say And as limited beings
 Scarcely can hope to attain upon earth to an Actual Abstract
 Leaving to God contemplation to His hands knowledge confiding
 Sure that in us if it perish in Him it abideth and dies not
 Let us in His sight accomplish our petty particular doings
 Yes and contented sit down to the victual that He has provided
 Allah is great no doubt and Juxtaposition his prophet
 Ah but the women alas they dont look at it that way
 Juxtaposition is greatbut my friend I fear me the maiden
 Hardly would thank or acknowledge the lover that sought to obtain her
 Not as the thing he would wish but the thing he must even put up with
 Hardly would tender her hand to the wooer that candidly told her
 That she is but for a space an adinterim solace and pleasure
 That in the end she shall yield to a perfect and absolute something
 Which I then for myself shall behold and not another
 Which amid fondest endearments meantime I forget not forsake not
 Ah ye feminine souls so loving and so exacting
 Since we cannot escape must we even submit to deceive you
 Since so cruel is truth sincerity shocks and revolts you
 Will you have us your slaves to lie to you flatter andleave you


 VII Claude to Eustace

 Juxtaposition is greatbut you tell me affinity greater
 Ah my friend there are many affinities greater and lesser
 Stronger and weaker and each by the favour of juxtaposition
 Potent efficient in forcefor a time but none let me tell you
 Save by the law of the land and the ruinous force of the will ah
 None I fear me at last quite sure to be final and perfect
 Lo as I pace in the street from the peasantgirl to the princess
 Homo sum nihil humani a me alienum puto
 Vir sum nihil faemineiand een to the uttermost circle
 All that is Natures is I and I all things that are Natures
 Yes as I walk I behold in a luminous large intuition
 That I can be and become anything that I meet with or look at
 I am the ox in the dray the ass with the gardenstuff panniers
 I am the dog in the doorway the kitten that plays in the window
 On sunny slab of the ruin the furtive and fugitive lizard
 Swallow above me that twitters and fly that is buzzing about me
 Yea and detect as I go by a faint but a faithful assurance
 Een from the stones of the street as from rocks or trees of the forest
 Something of kindred a common though latent vitality greets me
 And to escape from our strivings mistakings misgrowths and perversions
 Fain could demand to return to that perfect and primitive silence
 Fain be enfolded and fixed as of old in their rigid embraces


 VIII Claude to Eustace

 And as I walk on my way I behold them consorting and coupling
 Faithful it seemeth and fond very fond very probably faithful
 All as I go on my way with a pleasure sincere and unmingled
 Life is beautiful Eustace entrancing enchanting to look at
 As are the streets of a city we pace while the carriage is changing
 As a chamber filledin with harmonious exquisite pictures
 Even so beautiful Earth and could we eliminate only
 This vile hungering impulse this demon within us of craving
 Life were beatitude living a perfect divine satisfaction


 IX Claude to Eustace

 Mild monastic faces in quiet collegiate cloisters
 So let me offer a single and celibatarian phrase a
 Tribute to those whom perhaps you do not believe I can honour
 But from the tumult escaping tis pleasant of drumming and shouting
 Hither oblivious awhile to withdraw of the fact or the falsehood
 And amid placid regards and mildly courteous greetings
 Yield to the calm and composure and gentle abstraction that reign oer
 Mild monastic faces in quiet collegiate cloisters
 Terrible word Obligation You should not Eustace you should not
 No you should not have used it But oh great Heavens I repel it
 Oh I cancel reject disavow and repudiate wholly
 Every debt in this kind disclaim every claim and dishonour
 Yea my own hearts own writing my souls own signature Ah no
 I will be free in this you shall not none shall bind me
 No my friend if you wish to be told it was this above all things
 This that charmed me ah yes even this that she held me to nothing
 No I could talk as I pleased come close fasten ties as I fancied
 Bind and engage myself deepand lo on the following morning
 It was all een as before like losings in games played for nothing
 Yes when I came with mean fears in my soul with a semiperformance
 At the first step breaking down in its pitiful role of evasion
 When to shuffle I came to compromise not meet engagements
 Lo with her calm eyes there she met me and knew nothing of it
 Stood unexpecting unconscious SHE spoke not of obligations
 Knew not of debtah no I believe you for excellent reasons


 X Claude to Eustace

 HANG this thinking at last what good is it oh and what evil
 Oh what mischief and pain like a clock in a sick mans chamber
 Ticking and ticking and still through each covert of slumber pursuing
 What shall I do to thee O thou Preserver of men Have compassion
 Be favourable and hear Take from me this regal knowledge
 Let me contented and mute with the beasts of the fields my brothers
 Tranquilly happily lieand eat grass like Nebuchadnezzar


 XI Claude to Eustace

 Tibur is beautiful too and the orchard slopes and the Anio
 Falling falling yet to the ancient lyrical cadence
 Tibur and Anios tide and cool from Lucretilis ever
 With the Digentian stream and with the Bandusian fountain
 Folded in Sabine recesses the valley and villa of Horace
 So not seeing I sang so seeing and listening say I
 Here as I sit by the stream as I gaze at the cell of the Sibyl
 Here with Albuneas home and the grove of Tiburnus beside me 
 Tivoli beautiful is and musical O Teverone
 Dashing from mountain to plain thy parted impetuous waters
 Tivolis waters and rocks and fair unto Monte Gennaro
 Haunt even yet I must think as I wander and gaze of the shadows
 Faded and pale yet immortal of Faunus the Nymphs and the Graces
 Fair in itself and yet fairer with human completing creations
 Folded in Sabine recesses the valley and villa of Horace
 So not seeing I sang so nowNor seeing nor hearing
 Neither by waterfall lulled nor folded in sylvan embraces
 Neither by cell of the Sibyl nor stepping the Monte Gennaro
 Seated on Anios bank nor sipping Bandusian waters
 But on Montorios height looking down on the tileclad streets the
 Cupolas crosses and domes the bushes and kitchengardens
 Which by the grace of the Tibur proclaim themselves Rome of the Romans
 But on Montorios height looking forth to the vapoury mountains
 Cheating the prisoner Hope with illusions of vision and fancy
 But on Montorios height with these weary soldiers by me
 Waiting till Oudinot enter to reinstate Pope and Tourist

   domus Albuneae resonantis
 Et praeceps Anio et Tibuni lucus et uda
 Mobilibus pomaria rivis


 XII Mary Trevellyn to Miss Roper

 Dear Miss RoperIt seems George Vernon before we left Rome said
 Something to Mr Claude about what they call his attentions
 Susan two nights ago for the first time heard this from Georgina
 It is SO disagreeable and SO annoying to think of
 If it could only be known though we may never meet him again that
 It was all Georges doing and we were entirely unconscious
 It would extremely relieveYour ever affectionate Mary

 PS 1
 Here is your letter arrived this moment just as I wanted
 So you have seen himindeed and guessedhow dreadfully clever
 What did he really say and what was your answer exactly
 Charmingbut wait for a moment I havent read through the letter

 PS 2
 Ah my dearest Miss Roper do just as you fancy about it
 If you think it sincerer to tell him I know of it do so
 Though I should most extremely dislike it I know I could manage
 It is the simplest thing but surely wholly uncalled for
 Do as you please you know I trust implicitly to you
 Say whatever is right and needful for ending the matter
 Only dont tell Mr Claude what I will tell you as a secret
 That I should like very well to show him myself I forget it

 PS 3
 I am to say that the wedding is finally settled for Tuesday
 Ah my dear Miss Roper you surely surely can manage
 Not to let it appear that I know of that odious matter
 It would be pleasanter far for myself to treat it exactly
 As if it had not occurred and I do not think he would like it
 I must remember to add that as soon as the wedding is over
 We shall be off I believe in a hurry and travel to Milan
 There to meet friends of Papas I am told at the Croce di Malta
 Then I cannot say whither but not at present to England


 XIII Claude to Eustace

 Yes on Montorios height for a last farewell of the city
 So it appears though then I was quite uncertain about it
 So however it was And now to explain the proceeding
 I was to go as I told you I think with the people to Florence
 Only the day before the foolish family Vernon
 Made some uneasy remarks as we walked to our lodging together
 As to intentions forsooth and so forth I was astounded
 Horrified quite and obtaining just then as it happened an offer
 No common favour of seeing the great Ludovisi collection
 Why I made this a pretence and wrote that they must excuse me
 How could I go Great Heavens to conduct a permitted flirtation
 Under those vulgar eyes the observed of such observers
 Well but I now by a series of fine diplomatic inquiries
 Find from a sort of relation a good and sensible woman
 Who is remaining at Rome with a brother too ill for removal
 That it was wholly unsanctioned unknownnot I think by Georgina
 She however ere thisand that is the best of the story
 She and the Vernon thank Heaven are wedded and gonehoneymooning
 Soon Montorios height for a last farewell of the city
 Tibur I have not seen nor the lakes that of old I had dreamt of
 Tibur I shall not see nor Anios waters nor deep en
 Folded in Sabine recesses the valley and villa of Horace
 Tibur I shall not seebut something better I shall see
 Twice I have tried before and failed in getting the horses
 Twice I have tried and failed this time it shall not be a failure


 Therefore farewell ye hills and ye ye envineyarded ruins
 Therefore farewell ye walls palaces pillars and domes
 Therefore farewell far seen ye peaks of the mythic Albano
 Seen from Montorios height Tibur and Aesulas hills
 Ah could we once ere we go could we stand while to ocean descending
 Sinks oer the yellow dark plain slowly the yellow broad sun
 Stand from the forest emerging at sunset at once in the champaign
 Open but studded with trees chestnuts umbrageous and old
 Een in those fair open fields that incurve to thy beautiful hollow
 Nemi imbedded in wood Nemi inurned in the hill
 Therefore farewell ye plains and ye hills and the City Eternal
 Therefore farewell We depart but to behold you again




Canto IV


 Eastward or Northward or West I wander and ask as I wander
 Weary yet eager and sure Where shall I come to my love
 Whitherward hasten to seek her Ye daughters of Italy tell me
 Graceful and tender and dark is she consorting with you
 Thou that outclimbest the torrent that tendest thy goats to the summit
 Call to me child of the Alp has she been seen on the heights
 Italy farewell I bid thee for whither she leads me I follow
 Farewell the vineyard for I where I but guess her must go
 Weariness welcome and labour wherever it be if at last it
 Bring me in mountain or plain into the sight of my love


 I Claude to Eustacefrom Florence

 Gone from Florence indeed and that is truly provoking
 Gone to Milan it seems then I go also to Milan
 Five days now departed but they can travel but slowly
 I quicker far and I know as it happens the home they will go to
 Why what else should I do Stay here and look at the pictures
 Statues and churches Alack I am sick of the statues and pictures
 No to Bologna Parma Piacenza Lodi and Milan
 Off go we tonightand the Venus go to the Devil


 II Claude to Eustacefrom Bellaggio

 Gone to Como they said and I have posted to Como
 There was a letter left but the cameriere had lost it
 Could it have been for me They came however to Como
 And from Como went by the boatperhaps to the Spluegen
 Or to the Stelvio say and the Tyrol also it might be
 By Porlezza across to Lugano and so to the Simplon
 Possibly or the St Gothardor possibly too to Baveno
 Orta Turin and elsewhere Indeed I am greatly bewildered


 III Claude to Eustacefrom Bellaggio

 I have been up the Spluegen and on the Stelvio also
 Neither of these can I find they have followed in no one inn and
 This would be odd have they written their names I have been to Porlezza
 There they have not been seen and therefore not at Lugano
 What shall I do Go on through the Tyrol Switzerland Deutschland
 Seeking an inverse Saul a kingdom to find only asses
 There is a tide at least in the LOVE affairs of mortals
 Which when taken at flood leads on to the happiest fortune
 Leads to the marriagemorn and the orangeflowers and the altar
 And the long lawful line of crowned joys to crowned joys succeeding
 Ah it has ebbed with me Ye gods and when it was flowing
 Pitiful fool that I was to stand fiddlefaddling in that way


 IV Claude to Eustacefrom Bellaggio

 I have returned and found their names in the book at Como
 Certain it is I was right and yet I am also in error
 Added in feminine hand I read By the boat to Bellaggio
 So to Bellaggio again with the words of he writing to aid me
 Yet at Bellaggio I find no trace no sort of remembrance
 So I am here and wait and know every hour will remove them


 V Claude to Eustacefrom Bellaggio

 I have but one chance leftand that is going to Florence
 But it is cruel to turn The mountains seem to demand me
 Peak and valley from far to beckon and motion me onward
 Somewhere amid their folds she passes whom fain I would follow
 Somewhere amid those heights she haply calls me to seek her
 Ah could I hear her call could I catch the glimpse of her raiment
 Turn however I must though it seem I turn to desert her
 For the sense of the thing is simply to hurry to Florence
 Where the certainty yet may be learnt I suppose from the Ropers


 VI Mary Trevellyn from Lucerne to Miss Roper at Florence

 Dear Miss RoperBy this you are safely away we are hoping
 Many a league from Rome ere long we trust we shall see you
 How have you travelled I wonderwas Mr Claude your companion
 As for ourselves we went from Como straight to Lugano
 So by the Mount St Gothard we meant to go by Porlezza
 Taking the steamer and stopping as you had advised at Bellaggio
 Two or three days or more but this was suddenly altered
 After we left the hotel on the very way to the steamer
 So we have seen I fear not one of the lakes in perfection
 Well he is not come and now I suppose he will not come
 What will you think meantime and yet I must really confess it
 What will you say I wrote him a note We left in a hurry
 Went from Milan to Como three days before we expected
 But I thought if he came all the way to Milan he really
 Ought not to be disappointed and so I wrote three lines to
 Say I had heard he was coming desirous of joining our party
 If so then I said we had started for Como and meant to
 Cross the St Gothard and stay we believed at Lucerne for the summer
 Was it wrong and why if it was has it failed to bring him
 Did he not think it worth while to come to Milan He knew you
 Told him the house we should go to Or may it perhaps have miscarried
 Any way now I repent and am heartily vexed that I wrote it


 There is a home on the shore of the Alpine sea that upswelling
 High up the mountainsides spreads in the hollow between
 Wilderness mountain and snow from the land of the olive conceal it
 Under Pilatuss hill low by the river it lies
 Italy utter the word and the olive and vine will allure not
 Wilderness forest and snow will not the passage impede
 Italy unto thy cities receding the clue to recover
 Hither recovered the clue shall not the traveller haste





Canto V


 There is a city upbuilt on the quays of the turbulent Arno
 Under Fiesoles heightsthither are we to return
 There is a city that fringes the curve of the inflowing waters
 Under the perilous hill fringes the beautiful bay
 Parthenope do they call theethe Siren Neapolis seated
 Under Vesevuss hillare we receding to thee
 Sicily Greece will invite and the Orientor are we turn to
 England which may after all be for its children the best



 I Mary Trevellyn at Lucerne to Miss Roper at Florence

 So you are really free and living in quiet at Florence
 That is delightful news you travelled slowly and safely
 Mr Claude got you out took rooms at Florence before you
 Wrote from Milan to say so had left directly for Milan
 Hoping to find us soonif he could he would you are certain
 Dear Miss Roper your letter has made me exceedingly happy
 You are quite sure you say he asked you about our intentions
 You had not heard as yet of Lucerne but told him of Como
 Well perhaps he will come however I will not expect it
 Though you say you are sureif he can he will you are certain
 O my dear many thanks from your ever affectionate Mary


 II Claude to Eustace

 Florence
 Action will furnish beliefbut will that belief be the true one
 This is the point you know However it doesnt much matter
 What one wants I suppose is to predetermine the action
 So as to make it entail not a chance belief but the true one
 Out of the question you say if a thing isnt wrong we may do it
 Ah but this WRONG you seebut I do not know that it matters
 Eustace the Ropers are gone and no one can tell me about them

 Pisa
 Pisa they say they think and so I follow to Pisa
 Hither and thither inquiring I weary of making inquiries
 I am ashamed I declare of asking people about it
 Who are your friends You said you had friends who would certainly know them

 Florence
 But it is idle moping and thinking and trying to fix her
 Image once more and more in to write the whole perfect inscription
 Over and over again upon every page of remembrance
 I have settled to stay at Florence to wait for your answer
 Who are your friends Write quickly and tell me I wait for your answer


 III Mary Trevellyn to Miss Roperat Lucca Baths

 You are at Lucca baths you tell me to stay for the summer
 Florence was quite too hot you cant move further at present
 Will you not come do you think before the summer is over
 Mr C got you out with very considerable trouble
 And he was useful and kind and seemed so happy to serve you
 Didnt stay with you long but talked very openly to you
 Made you almost his confessor without appearing to know it
 What aboutand you say you didnt need his confessions
 O my dear Miss Roper I dare not trust what you tell me
 Will he come do you think I am really so sorry for him
 They didnt give him my letter at Milan I feel pretty certain
 You had told him Bellaggio We didnt go to Bellaggio
 So he would miss our track and perhaps never come to Lugano
 Where we were written in full To Lucerne across the St Gothard
 But he could write to youyou would tell him where you were going


 IV Claude to Eustace

 Let me then bear to forget her I will not cling to her falsely
 Nothing factitious or forced shall impair the old happy relation
 I will let myself go forget not try to remember
 I will walk on my way accept the chances that meet me
 Freely encounter the world imbibe these alien airs and
 Never ask if new feelings and thoughts are of her or of others
 Is she not changing herselfthe old image would only delude me
 I will be bold too and changeif it must be Yet if in all things
 Yet if I do but aspire evermore to the Absolute only
 I shall be doing I think somehow what she will be doing
 I shall be thine O my child some way though I know not in what way
 Let me submit to forget her I must I already forget her


 V Claude to Eustace

 Utterly vain is alas this attempt at the Absolutewholly
 I who believed not in her because I would fain believe nothing
 Have to believe as I may with a wilful unmeaning acceptance
 I who refused to enfasten the roots of my floating existence
 In the rich earth cling now to the hard naked rock that is left me
 Ah she was worthy Eustaceand that indeed is my comfort
 Worthy a nobler heart than a fool such as I could have given her

 

 Yes it relieves me to write though I do not send and the chance that
 Takes may destroy my fragments But as men pray without asking
 Whether One really exist to hear or do anything for them
 Simply impelled by the need of the moment to turn to a Being
 In a conception of whom there is freedom from all limitation
 So in your image I turn to an ens rationis of friendship
 Even so write in your name I know not to whom nor in what wise

 

 There was a time methought it was but lately departed
 When if a thing was denied me I felt I was bound to attempt it
 Choice alone should take and choice alone should surrender
 There was a time indeed when I had not retired thus early
 Languidly thus from pursuit of a purpose I once had adopted
 But it is all over all that I have slunk from the perilous field in
 Whose wild struggle of forces the prizes of life are contested
 It is over all that I am a coward and know it
 Courage in me could be only factitious unnatural useless

 

 Comfort has come to me here in the dreary streets of the city
 Comforthow do you thinkwith a barrelorgan to bring it
 Moping along the streets and cursing my day as I wandered
 All of a sudden my ear met the sound of an English psalmtune
 Comfort me it did till indeed I was very near crying
 Ah there is some great truth partial very likely but needful
 Lodged I am strangely sure in the tones of the English psalmtune
 Comfort it was at least and I must take without question
 Comfort however it come in the dreary streets of the city

 

 What with trusting myself and seeking support from within me
 Almost I could believe I had gained a religious assurance
 Formed in my own poor soul a great moral basis to rest on
 Ah but indeed I see I feel it factitious entirely
 I refuse reject and put it utterly from me
 I will look straight out see things not try to evade them
 Fact shall be fact for me and the Truth the Truth as ever
 Flexible changeable vague and multiform and doubtful
 Off and depart to the void thou subtle fanatical tempter

 

 I shall behold thee again is it so at a new visitation
 O ill genius thou I shall at my lifes dissolution
 When the pulses are weak and the feeble light of the reason
 Flickers an unfed flame retiring slow from the socket
 Low on a sickbed laid hear one as it were at the doorway
 And looking up see thee standing by looking emptily at me
 I shall entreat thee then though now I dare to refuse thee
 Pale and pitiful now but terrible then to the dying
 Well I will see thee again and while I can will repel thee


 VI Claude to Eustace

 Rome is fallen I hear the gallant Medici taken
 Noble Manara slain and Garibaldi has lost il Moro
 Rome is fallen and fallen or falling heroical Venice
 I meanwhile for the loss of a single small chit of a girl sit
 Moping and mourning herefor her and myself much smaller
 Whither depart the souls of the brave that die in the battle
 Die in the lost lost fight for the cause that perishes with them
 Are they upborne from the field on the slumberous pinions of angels
 Unto a faroff home where the weary rest from their labour
 And the deep wounds are healed and the bitter and burning moisture
 Wiped from the generous eyes or do they linger unhappy
 Pining and haunting the grave of their bygone hope and endeavour
 All declamation alas though I talk I care not for Rome nor
 Italy feebly and faintly and but with the lips can lament the
 Wreck of the Lombard youth and the victory of the oppressor
 Whither depart the braveGod knows I certainly do not


 VII Mary Trevellyn to Miss Roper

 He has not come as yet and now I must not expect it
 You have written you say to friends at Florence to see him
 If he perhaps should returnbut that is surely unlikely
 Has he not written to youhe did not know your direction
 Oh how strange never once to have told him where you were going
 Yet if he only wrote to Florence that would have reached you
 If what you say he said was true why has he not done so
 Is he gone back to Rome do you think to his Vatican marbles
 O my dear Miss Roper forgive me do not be angry
 You have written to Florenceyour friends would certainly find him
 Might you not write to himbut yet it is so little likely
 I shall expect nothing moreEver yours your affectionate Mary


 VIII Claude to Eustace

 I cannot stay at Florence not even to wait for a letter
 Galleries only oppress me Remembrance of hope I had cherished
 Almost more than as hope when I passed through Florence the first time
 Lies like a sword in my soul I am more a coward than ever
 Chickenhearted past thought The caffes and waiters distress me
 All is unkind and alas I am ready for anyones kindness
 Oh I knew it of old and knew it I thought to perfection
 If there is any one thing in the world to preclude all kindness
 It is the need of itit is this sad selfdefeating dependence
 Why is this Eustace Myself were I stronger I think I could tell you
 But it is odd when it comes So plumb I the deeps of depression
 Daily in deeper and find no support no will no purpose
 All my old strengths are gone And yet I shall have to do something
 Ah the key of our life that passes all wards opens all locks
 Is not I WILL but I MUST I mustI mustand I do it

 

 After all do I know that I really cared so about her
 Do whatever I will I cannot call up her image
 For when I close my eyes I see very likely St Peters
 Or the Pantheon facade or Michel Angelos figures
 Or at a wish when I please the Alban hills and the Forum
 But that face those eyesah no never anything like them
 Only try as I will a sort of featureless outline
 And a pale blank orb which no recollection will add to
 After all perhaps there was something factitious about it
 I have had pain it is true I have wept and so have the actors

 

 At the last moment I have your letter for which I was waiting
 I have taken my place and see no good in inquiries
 Do nothing more good Eustace I pray you It only will vex me
 Take no measures Indeed should we meet I could not be certain
 All might be changed you know Or perhaps there was nothing to be changed
 It is a curious history this and yet I foresaw it
 I could have told it before The Fates it is clear are against us
 For it is certain enough I met with the people you mention
 They were at Florence the day I returned there and spoke to me even
 Stayed a week saw me often departed and whither I know not
 Great is Fate and is best I believe in Providence partly
 What is ordained is right and all that happens is ordered
 Ah no that isnt it But yet I retain my conclusion
 I will go where I am led and will not dictate to the chances
 Do nothing more I beg If you love me forbear interfering


 IX Claude to Eustace

 Shall we come out of it all some day as one does from a tunnel
 Will it be all at once without our doing or asking
 We shall behold clear day the trees and meadows about us
 And the faces of friends and the eyes we loved looking at us
 Who knows Who can say It will not do to suppose it


 X Claude to Eustacefrom Rome

 Rome will not suit me Eustace the priests and soldiers possess it
 Priests and soldiersand ah which is the worst the priest or the soldier
 Politics farewell however For what could I do with inquiring
 Talking collating the journals go fever my brain about things oer
 Which I can have no control No happen whatever may happen
 Time I suppose will subsist the earth will revolve on its axis
 People will travel the stranger will wander as now in the city
 Rome will be here and the Pope the custode of Vatican marbles
 I have no heart however for any marble or fresco
 I have essayed it in vain tis in vain as yet to essay it
 But I may haply resume some day my studies in this kind
 Not as the Scripture says is I think the fact Ere our deathday
 Faith I think does pass and Love but Knowledge abideth
 Let us seek Knowledgethe rest may come and go as it happens
 Knowledge is hard to seek and harder yet to adhere to
 Knowledge is painful often and yet when we know we are happy
 Seek it and leave mere Faith and Love to come with the chances
 As for Hopetomorrow I hope to be starting for Naples
 Rome will not do I see for many very good reasons
 Eastward then I suppose with the coming of winter to Egypt


 XI Mary Trevellyn to Miss Roper

 You have heard nothing of course I know you can have heard nothing
 Ah well more than once I have broken my purpose and sometimes
 Only too often have looked for the little lake steamer to bring him
 But it is only fancyI do not really expect it
 Oh and you see I know so exactly how he would take it
 Finding the chances prevail against meeting again he would banish
 Forthwith every thought of the poor little possible hope which
 I myself could not help perhaps thinking only too much of
 He would resign himself and go I see it exactly
 So I also submit although in a different manner
 Can you not really come We go very shortly to England


 


 So go forth to the world to the good report and the evil
 Go little book thy tale is it not evil and good
 Go and if strangers revile pass quietly by without answer
 Go and if curious friends ask of thy rearing and age
 Say I am flitting about many years from brain unto brain of
 Feeble and restless youths born to inglorious days
 But so finish the word I was writ in a Roman chamber
 When from Janiculan heights thundered the cannon of France
