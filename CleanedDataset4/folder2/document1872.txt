CHAPTER I Mrs Stevens is Frightened


In the drowsy heat of the summer afternoon the Red House was taking its
siesta There was a lazy murmur of bees in the flowerborders a gentle
cooing of pigeons in the tops of the elms From distant lawns came
the whir of a mowingmachine that most restful of all country sounds
making ease the sweeter in that it is taken while others are working

It was the hour when even those whose business it is to attend to
the wants of others have a moment or two for themselves In the
housekeepers room Audrey Stevens the pretty parlourmaid retrimmed
her best hat and talked idly to her aunt the cookhousekeeper of Mr
Mark Abletts bachelor home

For Joe said Mrs Stevens placidly her eye on the hat Audrey
nodded She took a pin from her mouth found a place in the hat for it
and said He likes a bit of pink

I dont say I mind a bit of pink myself said her aunt Joe Turner
isnt the only one

It isnt everybodys colour said Audrey holding the hat out at arms
length and regarding it thoughtfully Stylish isnt it

Oh itll suit you all right and it would have suited me at your
age A bit too dressy for me now though wearing better than some other
people I daresay I was never the one to pretend to be what I wasnt
If Im fiftyfive Im fiftyfivethats what I say

Fiftyeight isnt it auntie

I was just giving that as an example said Mrs Stevens with great
dignity

Audrey threaded a needle held her hand out and looked at her nails
critically for a moment and then began to sew

Funny thing that about Mr Marks brother Fancy not seeing your
brother for fifteen years She gave a selfconscious laugh and went on
Wonder what I should do if I didnt see Joe for fifteen years

As I told you all this morning said her aunt Ive been here five
years and never heard of a brother I could say that before everybody
if I was going to die tomorrow Theres been no brother here while Ive
been here

You could have knocked me down with a feather when he spoke about him
at breakfast this morning I didnt hear what went before naturally
but they was all talking about the brother when I went innow what
was it I went in forhot milk was it or toastwell they was
all talking and Mr Mark turns to me and saysyou know his
wayStevens he says my brother is coming to see me this afternoon
Im expecting him about three he says Show him into the office he
says just like that Yes sir I says quite quietly but I was never
so surprised in my life not knowing he had a brother My brother from
Australia he saysthere Id forgotten that From Australia

Well he may have been in Australia said Mrs Stevens judicially I
cant say for that not knowing the country but what I do say is hes
never been here Not while Ive been here and thats five years

Well but auntie he hasnt been here for fifteen years I heard Mr
Mark telling Mr Cayley Fifteen years he says Mr Cayley having
arst him when his brother was last in England Mr Cayley knew of him
I heard him telling Mr Beverley but didnt know when he was last in
Englandsee So thats why he arst Mr Mark

Im not saying anything about fifteen years Audrey I can only speak
for what I know and thats five years Whitsuntide I can take my oath
hes not set foot in the house since five years Whitsuntide And if hes
been in Australia as you say well I daresay hes had his reasons

What reasons said Audrey lightly

Never mind what reasons Being in the place of a mother to you since
your poor mother died I say this Audreywhen a gentleman goes to
Australia he has his reasons And when he stays in Australia fifteen
years as Mr Mark says and as I know for myself for five years he
has his reasons And a respectably broughtup girl doesnt ask what
reasons

Got into trouble I suppose said Audrey carelessly They were saying
at breakfast hed been a wild one Debts Im glad Joe isnt like that
Hes got fifteen pounds in the postoffice savings bank Did I tell
you

But there was not to be any more talk of Joe Turner that afternoon The
ringing of a bell brought Audrey to her feetno longer Audrey but now
Stevens She arranged her cap in front of the glass

There thats the front door she said Thats him Show him into
the office said Mr Mark I suppose he doesnt want the other
ladies and gentlemen to see him Well theyre all out at their golf
anyhowWonder if hes going to stayPraps hes brought back a lot of
gold from AustraliaI might hear something about Australia because if
anybody can get gold there then I dont say but what Joe and I

Now now get on Audrey

Just going darling She went out

To anyone who had just walked down the drive in the August sun the open
door of the Red House revealed a delightfully inviting hall of which
even the mere sight was cooling It was a big lowroofed
oakbeamed place with creamwashed walls and diamondpaned windows
bluecurtained On the right and left were doors leading into other
livingrooms but on the side which faced you as you came in were
windows again looking on to a small grass court and from open windows
to open windows such air as there was played gently The staircase went
up in broad low steps along the righthand wall and turning to the
left led you along a gallery which ran across the width of the hall
to your bedroom That is if you were going to stay the night Mr
Robert Abletts intentions in this matter were as yet unknown

As Audrey came across the hall she gave a little start as she saw Mr
Cayley suddenly sitting unobtrusively in a seat beneath one of the
front windows reading No reason why he shouldnt be there certainly
a much cooler place than the golflinks on such a day but somehow there
was a deserted air about the house that afternoon as if all the guests
were outside orperhaps the wisest place of allup in their bedrooms
sleeping Mr Cayley the masters cousin was a surprise and having
given a little exclamation as she came suddenly upon him she blushed
and said Oh I beg your pardon sir I didnt see you at first and
he looked up from his book and smiled at her An attractive smile it was
on that big ugly face Such a gentleman Mr Cayley she thought to
herself as she went on and wondered what the master would do without
him If this brother for instance had to be bundled back to Australia
it was Mr Cayley who would do most of the bundling

So this is Mr Robert said Audrey to herself as she came in sight of
the visitor

She told her aunt afterwards that she would have known him anywhere for
Mr Marks brother but she would have said that in any event Actually
she was surprised Dapper little Mark with his neat pointed beard and
his carefully curled moustache with his quickdarting eyes always
moving from one to the other of any company he was in to register
one more smile to his credit when he had said a good thing one more
expectant look when he was only waiting his turn to say it he was
a very different man from this roughlooking illdressed colonial
staring at her so loweringly

I want to see Mr Mark Ablett he growled It sounded almost like a
threat

Audrey recovered herself and smiled reassuringly at him She had a smile
for everybody

Yes sir He is expecting you if you will come this way

Oh So you know who I am eh

Mr Robert Ablett

Ay thats right So hes expecting me eh Hell be glad to see me
eh

If you will come this way sir said Audrey primly

She went to the second door on the left and opened it

Mr Robert Ab she began and then broke off The room was empty She
turned to the man behind her If you will sit down sir I will find
the master I know hes in because he told me that you were coming this
afternoon

Oh He looked round the room What dyou call this place eh

The office sir

The office

The room where the master works sir

Works eh Thats new Didnt know hed ever done a stroke of work in
his life

Where he writes sir said Audrey with dignity The fact that Mr
Mark wrote though nobody knew what was a matter of pride in the
housekeepers room

Not welldressed enough for the drawingroom eh

I will tell the master you are here sir said Audrey decisively

She closed the door and left him there

Well Here was something to tell auntie Her mind was busy at once
going over all the things which he had said to her and she had said to
himquietlike Directly I saw him I said to myself Why you could
have knocked her over with a feather Feathers indeed were a perpetual
menace to Audrey

However the immediate business was to find the master She walked
across the hall to the library glanced in came back a little
uncertainly and stood in front of Cayley

If you please sir she said in a low respectful voice can you tell
me where the master is Its Mr Robert called

What said Cayley looking up from his book Who

Audrey repeated her question

I dont know Isnt he in the office He went up to the Temple after
lunch I dont think Ive seen him since

Thank you sir I will go up to the Temple

Cayley returned to his book

The Temple was a brick summerhouse in the gardens at the back of
the house about three hundred yards away Here Mark meditated sometimes
before retiring to the office to put his thoughts upon paper The
thoughts were not of any great value moreover they were given off at
the dinnertable more often than they got on to paper and got on to
paper more often than they got into print But that did not prevent
the master of The Red House from being a little pained when a visitor
treated the Temple carelessly as if it had been erected for the
ordinary purposes of flirtation and cigarettesmoking There had been an
occasion when two of his guests had been found playing fives in it Mark
had said nothing at the time save to ask with a little less than his
usual pointwhether they couldnt find anywhere else for their game
but the offenders were never asked to The Red House again

Audrey walked slowly up to the Temple looked in and walked slowly back
All that walk for nothing Perhaps the master was upstairs in his room
Not welldressed enough for the drawingroom Well now Auntie would
you like anyone in your drawingroom with a red handkerchief round his
neck and great big dusty boots andlisten One of the men shooting
rabbits Auntie was partial to a nice rabbit and onion sauce How hot
it was she wouldnt say no to a cup of tea Well one thing Mr Robert
wasnt staying the night he hadnt any luggage Of course Mr Mark
could lend him things he had clothes enough for six She would have
known him anywhere for Mr Marks brother

She came into the house As she passed the housekeepers room on her
way to the hall the door opened suddenly and a rather frightened face
looked out

Hallo Aud said Elsie Its Audrey she said turning into the
room

Come in Audrey called Mrs Stevens

Whats up said Audrey looking in at the door

Oh my dear you gave me such a turn Where have you been

Up to the Temple

Did you hear anything

Hear what

Bangs and explosions and terrible things

Oh said Audrey rather relieved One of the men shooting rabbits
Why I said to myself as I came along Aunties partial to a nice
rabbit I said and I shouldnt be surprised if

Rabbits said her aunt scornfully It was inside the house my girl

Straight it was said Elsie She was one of the housemaids I said to
Mrs Stevensdidnt I Mrs StevensThat was in the house I said

Audrey looked at her aunt and then at Elsie

Do you think he had a revolver with him she said in a hushed voice

Who said Elsie excitedly

That brother of his From Australia I said as soon as I set eyes on
him Youre a bad lot my man Thats what I said Elsie Even before
he spoke to me Rude She turned to her aunt Well I give you my
word

If you remember Audrey I always said there was no saying with anyone
from Australia Mrs Stevens lay back in her chair breathing rather
rapidly I wouldnt go out of this room now not if you paid me a
hundred thousand pounds

Oh Mrs Stevens said Elsie who badly wanted five shillings for a
new pair of shoes I wouldnt go as far as that not myself but

There cried Mrs Stevens sitting up with a start They listened
anxiously the two girls instinctively coming closer to the older
womans chair

A door was being shaken kicked rattled

Listen

Audrey and Elsie looked at each other with frightened eyes

They heard a mans voice loud angry

Open the door it was shouting Open the door I say open the door

Dont open the door cried Mrs Stevens in a panic as if it was her
door which was threatened Audrey Elsie Dont let him in

Damn it open the door came the voice again

Were all going to be murdered in our beds she quavered Terrified
the two girls huddled closer and with an arm round each Mrs Stevens
sat there waiting




CHAPTER II Mr Gillingham Gets Out at the Wrong Station


Whether Mark Ablett was a bore or not depended on the point of view but
it may be said at once that he never bored his company on the subject of
his early life However stories get about There is always somebody
who knows It was understoodand this anyhow on Marks own
authoritythat his father had been a country clergyman It was said
that as a boy Mark had attracted the notice and patronage of some
rich old spinster of the neighbourhood who had paid for his education
both at school and university At about the time when he was coming down
from Cambridge his father had died leaving behind him a few debts
as a warning to his family and a reputation for short sermons as an
example to his successor Neither warning nor example seems to have been
effective Mark went to London with an allowance from his patron and
it is generally agreed made acquaintance with the moneylenders
He was supposed by his patron and any others who inquired to be
writing but what he wrote other than letters asking for more time
to pay has never been discovered However he attended the theatres
and music halls very regularlyno doubt with a view to some serious
articles in the Spectator on the decadence of the English stage

Fortunately from Marks point of view his patron died during his third
year in London and left him all the money he wanted From that moment
his life loses its legendary character and becomes more a matter of
history He settled accounts with the moneylenders abandoned his
crop of wild oats to the harvesting of others and became in his turn a
patron He patronized the Arts It was not only usurers who discovered
that Mark Ablett no longer wrote for money editors were now offered
free contributions as well as free lunches publishers were given
agreements for an occasional slender volume in which the author paid
all expenses and waived all royalties promising young painters and
poets dined with him and he even took a theatrical company on tour
playing host and lead with equal lavishness

He was not what most people call a snob A snob has been defined
carelessly as a man who loves a lord and more carefully as a mean
lover of mean thingswhich would be a little unkind to the peerage if
the first definition were true Mark had his vanities undoubtedly but
he would sooner have met an actormanager than an earl he would have
spoken of his friendship with Dantehad that been possiblemore glibly
than of his friendship with the Duke Call him a snob if you like but
not the worst kind of snob a hangeron but to the skirts of Art not
Society a climber but in the neighbourhood of Parnassus not Hay Hill

His patronage did not stop at the Arts It also included Matthew Cayley
a small cousin of thirteen whose circumstances were as limited as had
been Marks own before his patron had rescued him He sent the Cayley
cousin to school and Cambridge His motives no doubt were unworldly
enough at first a mere repaying to his account in the Recording Angels
book of the generosity which had been lavished on himself a layingup
of treasure in heaven But it is probable that as the boy grew up
Marks designs for his future were based on his own interests as much
as those of his cousin and that a suitably educated Matthew Cayley of
twentythree was felt by him to be a useful property for a man in his
position a man that is to say whose vanities left him so little time
for his affairs

Cayley then at twentythree looked after his cousins affairs By
this time Mark had bought the Red House and the considerable amount of
land which went with it Cayley superintended the necessary staff
His duties indeed were many He was not quite secretary not quite
landagent not quite businessadviser not quite companion but
something of all four Mark leant upon him and called him Cay
objecting quite rightly in the circumstances to the name of Matthew
Cay he felt was above all dependable a big heavyjawed solid
fellow who didnt bother you with unnecessary talka boon to a man who
liked to do most of the talking himself

Cayley was now twentyeight but had all the appearance of forty which
was his patrons age Spasmodically they entertained a good deal at the
Red House and Marks preferencecall it kindliness or vanity as
you pleasewas for guests who were not in a position to repay his
hospitality Let us have a look at them as they came down to that
breakfast of which Stevens the parlourmaid has already given us a
glimpse

The first to appear was Major Rumbold a tall greyhaired
greymoustached silent man wearing a Norfolk coat and grey flannel
trousers who lived on his retired pay and wrote natural history
articles for the papers He inspected the dishes on the sidetable
decided carefully on kedgeree and got to work on it He had passed on
to a sausage by the time of the next arrival This was Bill Beverly a
cheerful young man in white flannel trousers and a blazer

Hallo Major he said as he came in hows the gout

It isnt gout said the Major gruffly

Well whatever it is

The Major grunted

I make a point of being polite at breakfast said Bill helping
himself largely to porridge Most people are so rude Thats why I
asked you But dont tell me if its a secret Coffee he added as he
poured himself out a cup

No thanks I never drink till Ive finished eating

Quite right Major its only manners He sat down opposite to the
other Well weve got a good day for our game Its going to be dashed
hot but thats where Betty and I score On the fifth green your old
wound the one you got in that frontier skirmish in 43 will begin to
trouble you on the eighth your liver undermined by years of curry
will drop to pieces on the twelfth

Oh shut up you ass

Well Im only warning you Hallo good morning Miss Norris I was
just telling the Major what was going to happen to you and him this
morning Do you want any assistance or do you prefer choosing your own
breakfast

Please dont get up said Miss Norris Ill help myself Good
morning Major She smiled pleasantly at him The Major nodded

Good morning Going to be hot

As I was telling him began Bill thats whereHallo heres Betty
Morning Cayley

Betty Calladine and Cayley had come in together Betty was the
eighteenyearold daughter of Mrs John Calladine widow of the painter
who was acting hostess on this occasion for Mark Ruth Norris took
herself seriously as an actress and on her holidays seriously as a
golfer She was quite competent as either Neither the Stage Society nor
Sandwich had any terrors for her

By the way the car will be round at 1030 said Cayley looking up
from his letters Youre lunching there and driving back directly
afterwards Isnt that right

I dont see why we shouldnt havetwo rounds said Bill hopefully

Much too hot in the afternoon said the Major Get back comfortably
for tea

Mark came in He was generally the last He greeted them and sat down to
toast and tea Breakfast was not his meal The others chattered gently
while he read his letters

Good God said Mark suddenly

There was an instinctive turning of heads towards him I beg your
pardon Miss Norris Sorry Betty

Miss Norris smiled her forgiveness She often wanted to say it herself
particularly at rehearsals

I say Cay He was frowning to himselfannoyed puzzled He held up a
letter and shook it Who do you think this is from

Cayley at the other end of the table shrugged his shoulders How could
he possibly guess

Robert said Mark

Robert It was difficult to surprise Cayley Well

Its all very well to say well like that said Mark peevishly
Hes coming here this afternoon

I thought he was in Australia or somewhere

Of course So did I He looked across at Rumbold Got any brothers
Major

No

Well take my advice and dont have any

Not likely to now said the Major

Bill laughed Miss Norris said politely But you havent any brothers
Mr Ablett

One said Mark grimly If youre back in time youll see him this
afternoon Hell probably ask you to lend him five pounds Dont

Everybody felt a little uncomfortable

Ive got a brother said Bill helpfully but I always borrow from
him

Like Robert said Mark

When was he in England last asked Cayley

About fifteen years ago wasnt it Youd have been a boy of course

Yes I remember seeing him once about then but I didnt know if he had
been back since

No Not to my knowledge Mark still obviously upset returned to his
letter

Personally said Bill I think relations are a great mistake

All the same said Betty a little daringly it must be rather fun
having a skeleton in the cupboard

Mark looked up frowning

If you think its fun Ill hand him over to you Betty If hes
anything like he used to be and like his few letters have beenwell
Cay knows

Cayley grunted

All I knew was that one didnt ask questions about him

It may have been meant as a hint to any too curious guest not to ask
more questions or a reminder to his host not to talk too freely in
front of strangers although he gave it the sound of a mere statement of
fact But the subject dropped to be succeeded by the more fascinating
one of the coming foursome Mrs Calladine was driving over with the
players in order to lunch with an old friend who lived near the links
and Mark and Cayley were remaining at homeon affairs Apparently
affairs were now to include a prodigal brother But that need not make
the foursome less enjoyable

At about the time when the Major for whatever reasons was fluffing
his teeshot at the sixteenth and Mark and his cousin were at their
business at the Red House an attractive gentleman of the name of Antony
Gillingham was handing up his ticket at Woodham station and asking the
way to the village Having received directions he left his bag with the
stationmaster and walked off leisurely He is an important person to
this story so that it is as well we should know something about him
before letting him loose in it Let us stop him at the top of the hill
on some excuse and have a good look at him

The first thing we realize is that he is doing more of the looking
than we are Above a cleancut cleanshaven face of the type usually
associated with the Navy he carries a pair of grey eyes which seem
to be absorbing every detail of our person To strangers this look is
almost alarming at first until they discover that his mind is very
often elsewhere that he has so to speak left his eyes on guard while
he himself follows a train of thought in another direction Many people
do this of course when for instance they are talking to one person
and trying to listen to another but their eyes betray them Antonys
never did

He had seen a good deal of the world with those eyes though never as a
sailor When at the age of twentyone he came into his mothers money
400 pounds a year old Gillingham looked up from the Stockbreeders
Gazette to ask what he was going to do

See the world said Antony

Well send me a line from America or wherever you get to

Right said Antony

Old Gillingham returned to his paper Antony was a younger son and
on the whole not so interesting to his father as the cadets of certain
other families Champion Birkets for instance But then Champion
Birket was the best Hereford bull he had ever bred

Antony however had no intention of going further away than London His
idea of seeing the world was to see not countries but people and to
see them from as many angles as possible There are all sorts in London
if you know how to look at them So Antony looked at themfrom
various strange corners from the viewpoint of the valet the
newspaperreporter the waiter the shopassistant With the
independence of 400 pounds a year behind him he enjoyed it immensely
He never stayed long in one job and generally closed his connection
with it by telling his employer contrary to all etiquette as understood
between master and servant exactly what he thought of him He had
no difficulty in finding a new profession Instead of experience and
testimonials he offered his personality and a sporting bet He would
take no wages the first month andif he satisfied his employerdouble
wages the second He always got his double wages

He was now thirty He had come to Waldheim for a holiday because
he liked the look of the station His ticket entitled him to travel
further but he had always intended to please himself in the matter
Waldheim attracted him and he had a suitcase in the carriage with him
and money in his pocket Why not get out

The landlady of The George was only too glad to put him up and
promised that her husband would drive over that afternoon for his
luggage

And you would like some lunch I expect sir

Yes but dont give yourself any trouble about it Cold
anythingyouvegot

What about beef sir she asked as if she had a hundred varieties of
meat to select from and was offering him her best

That will do splendidly And a pint of beer

While he was finishing his lunch the landlord came in to ask about the
luggage Antony ordered another pint and soon had him talking

It must be rather fun to keep a country inn he said thinking that it
was about time he started another profession

I dont know about fun sir It gives us a living and a bit over

You ought to take a holiday said Antony looking at him thoughtfully

Funny thing your saying that said the landlord with a smile
Another gentleman over from the Red House was saying that only
yesterday Offered to take my place n all He laughed rumblingly

The Red House Not the Red House Stanton

Thats right sir Stantons the next station to Waldheim The Red
House is about a mile from hereMr Abletts

Antony took a letter from his pocket It was addressed from The Red
House Stanton and signed Bill

Good old Bill he murmured to himself Hes getting on

Antony had met Bill Beverley two years before in a tobacconists shop
Gillingham was on one side of the counter and Mr Beverley on the
other Something about Bill his youth and freshness perhaps attracted
Antony and when cigarettes had been ordered and an address given to
which they were to be sent he remembered that he had come across an
aunt of Beverleys once at a countryhouse Beverley and he met again
a little later at a restaurant Both of them were in eveningdress but
they did different things with their napkins and Antony was the more
polite of the two However he still liked Bill So on one of his
holidays when he was unemployed he arranged an introduction through a
mutual friend Beverley was a little inclined to be shocked when he was
reminded of their previous meetings but his uncomfortable feeling soon
wore off and he and Antony quickly became intimate But Bill generally
addressed him as Dear Madman when he happened to write

Antony decided to stroll over to the Red House after lunch and call
upon his friend Having inspected his bedroom which was not quite the
lavendersmelling countryinn bedroom of fiction but sufficiently clean
and comfortable he set out over the fields

As he came down the drive and approached the old redbrick front of the
house there was a lazy murmur of bees in the flowerborders a gentle
cooing of pigeons in the tops of the elms and from distant lawns the
whir of a mowingmachine that most restful of all country sounds

And in the hall a man was banging at a locked door and shouting Open
the door I say open the door

Hallo said Antony in amazement




CHAPTER III Two Men and a Body


Cayley looked round suddenly at the voice

Can I help said Antony politely

Somethings happened said Cayley He was breathing quickly I heard
a shotit sounded like a shotI was in the library A loud bangI
didnt know what it was And the doors locked He rattled the handle
again and shook it Open the door he cried I say Mark what is
it Open the door

But he must have locked the door on purpose said Antony So why
should he open it just because you ask him to

Cayley looked at him in a bewildered way Then he turned to the door
again We must break it in he said putting his shoulder to it Help
me

Isnt there a window

Cayley turned to him stupidly

Window Window

So much easier to break in a window said Antony with a smile He
looked very cool and collected as he stood just inside the hall
leaning on his stick and thinking no doubt that a great deal of fuss
was being made about nothing But then he had not heard the shot

Windowof course What an idiot I am

He pushed past Antony and began running out into the drive Antony
followed him They ran along the front of the house down a path to the
left and then to the left again over the grass Cayley in front the
other close behind him Suddenly Cayley looked over his shoulder and
pulled up short

Here he said

They had come to the windows of the locked room French windows which
opened on to the lawns at the back of the house But now they were
closed Antony couldnt help feeling a thrill of excitement as he
followed Cayleys example and put his face close up to the glass For
the first time he wondered if there really had been a revolver shot in
this mysterious room It had all seemed so absurd and melodramatic from
the other side of the door But if there had been one shot why should
there not be two moreat the careless fools who were pressing their
noses against the panes and asking for it

My God can you see it said Cayley in a shaking voice Down there
Look

The next moment Antony saw it A man was lying on the floor at the far
end of the room his back towards them A man Or the body of a man

Who is it said Antony

I dont know the other whispered

Well wed better go and see He considered the windows for a moment
I should think if you put your weight into it just where they join
theyll give all right Otherwise we can kick the glass in

Without saying anything Cayley put his weight into it The window gave
and they went into the room Cayley walked quickly to the body and
dropped on his knees by it For the moment he seemed to hesitate then
with an effort he put a hand on to its shoulder and pulled it over

Thank God he murmured and let the body go again

Who is it said Antony

Robert Ablett

Oh said Antony I thought his name was Mark he added more to
himself than to the other

Yes Mark Ablett lives here Robert is his brother He shuddered and
said I was afraid it was Mark

Was Mark in the room too

Yes said Cayley absently Then as if resenting suddenly these
questions from a stranger Who are you

But Antony had gone to the locked door and was turning the handle I
suppose he put the key in his pocket he said as he came back to the
body again

Who

Antony shrugged his shoulders

Whoever did this he said pointing to the man on the floor Is he
dead

Help me said Cayley simply

They turned the body on to its back nerving themselves to look at it
Robert Ablett had been shot between the eyes It was not a pleasant
sight and with his horror Antony felt a sudden pity for the man beside
him and a sudden remorse for the careless easy way in which he had
treated the affair But then one always went about imagining that
these things didnt happenexcept to other people It was difficult to
believe in them just at first when they happened to yourself

Did you know him well said Antony quietly He meant Were you fond
of him

Hardly at all Mark is my cousin I mean Mark is the brother I know
best

Your cousin

Yes He hesitated and then said Is he dead I suppose he is Will
youdo you know anything aboutabout that sort of thing Perhaps Id
better get some water

There was another door opposite to the locked one which led as Antony
was to discover for himself directly into a passage from which opened
two more rooms Cayley stepped into the passage and opened the door on
the right The door from the office through which he had gone remained
open The door at the end of the short passage was shut Antony
kneeling by the body followed Cayley with his eyes and after he had
disappeared kept his eyes on the blank wall of the passage but he was
not conscious of that at which he was looking for his mind was with the
other man sympathizing with him

Not that water is any use to a dead body he said to himself but the
feeling that youre doing something when theres obviously nothing to
be done is a great comfort

Cayley came into the room again He had a sponge in one hand a
handkerchief in the other He looked at Antony Antony nodded Cayley
murmured something and knelt down to bathe the dead mans face Then he
placed the handkerchief over it A little sigh escaped Antony a sigh of
relief

They stood up and looked at each other

If I can be of any help to you said Antony please let me

Thats very kind of you There will be things to do Police doctorsI
dont know But you mustnt let me trespass on your kindness Indeed I
should apologise for having trespassed so much already

I came to see Beverley He is an old friend of mine

Hes out playing golf He will be back directly Then as if he had
only just realized it They will all be back directly

I will stay if I can be of any help

Please do You see there are women It will be rather painful If you
would He hesitated and gave Antony a timid little smile pathetic
in so big and selfreliant a man Just your moral support you know It
would be something

Of course Antony smiled back at him and said cheerfully Well
then Ill begin by suggesting that you should ring up the police

The police Yyes He looked doubtfully at the other I suppose

Antony spoke frankly

Now look here Mrer

Cayley Im Mark Abletts cousin I live with him

My names Gillingham Im sorry I ought to have told you before Well
now Mr Cayley we shant do any good by pretending Heres a man been
shotwell somebody shot him

He might have shot himself mumbled Cayley

Yes he might have but he didnt Or if he did somebody was in the
room at the time and that somebody isnt here now And that somebody
took a revolver away with him Well the police will want to say a word
about that wont they

Cayley was silent looking on the ground

Oh I know what youre thinking and believe me I do sympathize with
you but we cant be children about it If your cousin Mark Ablett was
in the room with thishe indicated the bodythis man then

Who said he was said Cayley jerking his head up suddenly at Antony

You did

I was in the library Mark went inhe may have come out againI know
nothing Somebody else may have gone in

Yes yes said Antony patiently as if to a little child You know
your cousin I dont Lets agree that he had nothing to do with it But
somebody was in the room when this man was shot andwell the police
will have to know Dont you think He looked at the telephone Or
would you rather I did it

Cayley shrugged his shoulders and went to the telephone

May Ierlook round a bit Antony nodded towards the open door

Oh do Yes He sat down and drew the telephone towards him You must
make allowances for me Mr Gillingham You see Ive known Mark for a
very long time But of course youre quite right and Im merely being
stupid He took off the receiver

Let us suppose that for the purpose of making a first acquaintance with
this office we are coming into it from the hall through the door
which is now locked but which for our special convenience has been
magically unlocked for us As we stand just inside the door the length
of the room runs right and left or more accurately to the right only
for the lefthand wall is almost within our reach Immediately opposite
to us across the breadth of the room some fifteen feet is that other
door by which Cayley went out and returned a few minutes ago In the
righthand wall thirty feet away from us are the French windows
Crossing the room and going out by the opposite door we come into a
passage from which two rooms lead The one on the right into which
Cayley went is less than half the length of the office a small square
room which has evidently been used some time or other as a bedroom The
bed is no longer there but there is a basin with hot and cold taps in
a corner chairs a cupboard or two and a chest of drawers The window
faces the same way as the French windows in the next room but anybody
looking out of the bedroom window has his view on the immediate right
shut off by the outer wall of the office which projects by reason of
its greater length fifteen feet further into the lawn

The room on the other side of the bedroom is a bathroom The three rooms
together in fact form a sort of private suite used perhaps during
the occupation of the previous owner by some invalid who could not
manage the stairs but allowed by Mark to fall into disuse save for the
livingroom At any rate he never slept downstairs

Antony glanced at the bathroom and then wandered into the bedroom the
room into which Cayley had been The window was open and he looked out
at the wellkept grass beneath him and the peaceful stretch of park
beyond and he felt very sorry for the owner of it all who was now
mixed up in so grim a business

Cayley thinks he did it said Antony to himself Thats obvious It
explains why he wasted so much time banging on the door Why should
he try to break a lock when its so much easier to break a window
Of course he might just have lost his head on the other hand he
mightwell he might have wanted to give his cousin a chance of getting
away The same about the police andoh lots of things Why for
instance did we run all the way round the house in order to get to the
windows Surely theres a back way out through the hall I must have a
look later on

Antony it will be observed had by no means lost his head

There was a step in the passage outside and he turned round to see
Cayley in the doorway He remained looking at him for a moment asking
himself a question It was rather a curious question He was asking
himself why the door was open

Well not exactly why the door was open that could be explained easily
enough But why had he expected the door to be shut He did not remember
shutting it but somehow he was surprised to see it open now to see
Cayley through the doorway just coming into the room Something working
subconsciously in his brain had told him that it was surprising Why

He tucked the matter away in a corner of his mind for the moment the
answer would come to him later on He had a wonderfully retentive
mind Everything which he saw or heard seemed to make its corresponding
impression somewhere in his brain often without his being conscious of
it and these photographic impressions were always there ready for him
when he wished to develop them

Cayley joined him at the window

Ive telephoned he said Theyre sending an inspector or some one
from Middleston and the local police and doctor from Stanton He
shrugged his shoulders Were in for it now

How far away is Middleston It was the town for which Antony had taken
a ticket that morningonly six hours ago How absurd it seemed

About twenty miles These people will be coming back soon

Beverley and the others

Yes I expect theyll want to go away at once

Much better that they should

Yes Cayley was silent for a little Then he said Youre staying
near here

Im at The George at Waldheim

If youre by yourself I wish youd put up here You see he went on
awkwardly youll have to be herefor thethe inquest andand so
on If I may offer you my cousins hospitality in hisI mean if he
doesntif he really has

Antony broke in hastily with his thanks and acceptance

Thats good Perhaps Beverley will stay on if hes a friend of yours
Hes a good fellow

Antony felt quite sure from what Cayley had said and had hesitated to
say that Mark had been the last to see his brother alive It didnt
follow that Mark Ablett was a murderer Revolvers go off accidentally
and when they have gone off people lose their heads and run away
fearing that their story will not be believed Nevertheless when people
run away whether innocently or guiltily one cant help wondering which
way they went

I suppose this way said Antony aloud looking out of the window

Who said Cayley stubbornly

Well whoever it was said Antony smiling to himself The murderer
Or let us say the man who locked the door after Robert Ablett was
killed

I wonder

Well how else could he have got away He didnt go by the windows in
the next room because they were shut

Isnt that rather odd

Well I thought so at first but He pointed to the wall jutting out
on the right You see youre protected from the rest of the house if
you get out here and youre quite close to the shrubbery If you go out
at the French windows I imagine youre much more visible All that part
of the house he waved his right handthe west well northwest
almost where the kitchen parts areyou see youre hidden from them
here Oh yes he knew the house whoever it was and he was quite right
to come out of this window Hed be into the shrubbery at once

Cayley looked at him thoughtfully

It seems to me Mr Gillingham that you know the house pretty well
considering that this is the first time youve been to it

Antony laughed

Oh well I notice things you know I was born noticing But Im
right arent I about why he went out this way

Yes I think you are Cayley looked awaytowards the shrubbery Do
you want to go noticing in there now He nodded at it

I think we might leave that to the police said Antony gently
Itswell theres no hurry

Cayley gave a little sigh as if he had been holding his breath for the
answer and could now breathe again

Thank you Mr Gillingham he said




CHAPTER IV The Brother from Australia


Guests at the Red House were allowed to do what they liked within
reasonthe reasonableness or otherwise of it being decided by Mark But
when once they or Mark had made up their minds as to what they wanted
to do the plan had to be kept Mrs Calladine who knew this little
weakness of their hosts resisted therefore the suggestion of Bill
that they should have a second round in the afternoon and drive home
comfortably after tea The other golfers were willing enough but Mrs
Calladine without actually saying that Mr Ablett wouldnt like it was
firm on the point that having arranged to be back by four they should
be back by four

I really dont think Mark wants us you know said the Major Having
played badly in the morning he wanted to prove to himself in the
afternoon that he was really better than that With this brother of his
coming hell be only too glad to have us out of the way

Of course he will Major This from Bill Youd like to play
wouldnt you Miss Norris

Miss Norris looked doubtfully at the hostess

Of course if you want to get back dear we mustnt keep you here
Besides its so dull for you not playing

Just nine holes mother pleaded Betty

The car could take you back and you could tell them that we were
having another round and then it could come back for us said Bill
brilliantly

Its certainly much cooler here than I expected put in the Major

Mrs Calladine fell It was very pleasantly cool outside the golfhouse
and of course Mark would be rather glad to have them out of the way So
she consented to nine holes and the match having ended allsquare and
everybody having played much better than in the morning they drove back
to the Red House very well pleased with themselves

Halo said Bill to himself as they approached the house isnt that
old Tony

Antony was standing in front of the house waiting for them Bill waved
and he waved back Then as the car drew up Bill who was in front with
the chauffeur jumped down and greeted him eagerly

Hallo you madman have you come to stay or what He had a sudden
idea Dont say youre Mark Abletts longlost brother from Australia
though I could quite believe it of you He laughed boyishly

Hallo Bill said Antony quietly Will you introduce me Im afraid
Ive got some bad news

Bill rather sobered by this introduced him The Major and Mrs
Calladine were on the near side of the car and Antony spoke to them in
a low voice

Im afraid Im going to give you rather a shock he said Robert
Ablett Mr Mark Abletts brother has been killed He jerked a thumb
over his shoulder In the house

Good God said the Major

Do you mean that he has killed himself asked Mrs Calladine Just
now

It was about two hours ago I happened to come herehe halfturned
to Beverley and explainedI was coming to see you Bill and I arrived
just after thethe death Mr Cayley and I found the body Mr Cayley
being busy just nowthere are police and doctors and so on in the
househe asked me to tell you He says that no doubt you would prefer
the houseparty having been broken up in this tragic way to leave as
soon as possible He gave a pleasant apologetic little smile and went
on I am putting it badly but what he means of course is that you
must consult your own feelings in the matter entirely and please make
your own arrangements about ordering the car for whatever train you wish
to catch There is one this evening I understand which you could go by
if you wished it

Bill gazed with open mouth at Antony He had no words in his vocabulary
to express what he wanted to say other than those the Major had
already used Betty was leaning across to Miss Norris and saying Whos
killed in an awestruck voice and Miss Norris who was instinctively
looking as tragic as she looked on the stage when a messenger announced
the death of one of the cast stopped for a moment in order to explain
Mrs Calladine was quietly mistress of herself

We shall be in the way yes I quite understand she said but we
cant just shake the dust of the place off our shoes because something
terrible has happened there I must see Mark and we can arrange later
what to do He must know how very deeply we feel for him Perhaps we
she hesitated

The Major and I might be useful anyway said Bill Isnt that what
you mean Mrs Calladine

Where is Mark said the Major suddenly looking hard at Antony

Antony looked back unwaveringlyand said nothing

I think said the Major gently leaning over to Mrs Calladine that
it would be better if you took Betty back to London tonight

Very well she agreed quietly You will come with us Ruth

Ill see you safely there said Bill in a meek voice He didnt quite
know what was happening and having expected to stay at the Red House
for another week he had nowhere to go to in London but London seemed
to be the place that everyone was going to and when he could get Tony
alone for a moment Tony no doubt would explain

Cayley wants you to stay Bill You have to go anyhow tomorrow Major
Rumbold

Yes Ill come with you Mrs Calladine

Mr Cayley would wish me to say again that you will please not hesitate
to give your own orders both as regard the car and as regard any
telephoning or telegraphing that you want done He smiled again and
added Please forgive me if I seem to have taken a good deal upon
myself but I just happened to be handy as a mouthpiece for Cayley He
bowed to them and went into the house

Well said Miss Norris dramatically

As Antony reentered the hall the Inspector from Middleston was just
crossing into the library with Cayley The latter stopped and nodded to
Antony

Wait a moment Inspector Heres Mr Gillingham Hed better come with
us And then to Antony This is Inspector Birch

Birch looked inquiringly from one to the other

Mr Gillingham and I found the body together explained Cayley

Oh Well come along and lets get the facts sorted out a bit I like
to know where I am Mr Gillingham

We all do

Oh He looked at Antony with interest Dyou know where you are in
this case

I know where Im going to be

Wheres that

Put through it by Inspector Birch said Antony with a smile

The inspector laughed genially

Well Ill spare you as much as I can Come along

They went into the library The inspector seated himself at a
writingtable and Cayley sat in a chair by the side of it Antony made
himself comfortable in an armchair and prepared to be interested

Well start with the dead man said the Inspector Robert Ablett
didnt you say He took out his notebook

Yes Brother of Mark Ablett who lives here

Ah He began to sharpen a pencil Staying in the house

Oh no

Antony listened attentively while Cayley explained all that he knew
about Robert This was news to him I see Sent out of the country in
disgrace What had he done

I hardly know I was only about twelve at the time The sort of age
when youre told not to ask questions

Inconvenient questions

Exactly

So you dont really know whether he had been merely wild oror
wicked

No Old Mr Ablett was a clergyman added Cayley Perhaps what might
seem wicked to a clergyman might seem only wild to a man of the world

I daresay Mr Cayley smiled the Inspector Anyhow it was more
convenient to have him in Australia

Yes

Mark Ablett never talked about him

Hardly ever He was very much ashamed of him andwell very glad he
was in Australia

Did he write Mark sometimes

Occasionally Perhaps three or four times in the last five years

Asking for money

Something of the sort I dont think Mark always answered them As far
as I know he never sent any money

Now your own private opinion Mr Cayley Do you think that Mark was
unfair to his brother Unduly hard on him

Theyd never liked each other as boys There was never any affection
between them I dont know whose fault it was in the first placeif
anybodys

Still Mark might have given him a hand

I understand said Cayley that Robert spent his whole life asking
for hands

The inspector nodded

I know that sort Well now well go on to this morning This letter
that Mark gotdid you see it

Not at the time He showed it to me afterwards

Any address

No A halfsheet of rather dirty paper

Where is it now

I dont know In Marks pocket I expect

Ah He pulled at his beard Well well come to that Can you
remember what it said

As far as I remember something like this Mark your loving brother
is coming to see you tomorrow all the way from Australia I give you
warning so that you will be able to conceal your surprise but not I
hope your pleasure Expect him at three or thereabouts

Ah The inspector copied it down carefully Did you notice the
postmark

London

And what was Marks attitude

Annoyance disgust Cayley hesitated

Apprehension

Nno not exactly Or rather apprehension of an unpleasant interview
not of any unpleasant outcome for himself

You mean that he wasnt afraid of violence or blackmail or anything
of that sort

He didnt appear to be

Right Now then he arrived you say about three oclock

Yes about that

Who was in the house then

Mark and myself and some of the servants I dont know which Of
course you will ask them directly no doubt

With your permission No guests

They were out all day playing golf explained Cayley Oh by the
way he put in if I may interrupt a moment will you want to see
them at all It isnt very pleasant for them now naturally and I
suggested he turned to Antony who nodded back to him I understand
that they want to go back to London this evening Theres no objection
to that I suppose

You will let me have their names and addresses in case I want to
communicate with them

Of course One of them is staying on if you would like to see him
later but they only came back from their golf as we crossed the hall

Thats all right Mr Cayley Well now then lets go back to three
oclock Where were you when Robert arrived

Cayley explained how he had been sitting in the hall how Audrey had
asked him where the master was and how he had said that he had last
seen him going up to the Temple

She went away and I went on with my book There was a step on the
stairs and I looked up to see Mark coming down He went into the
office and I went on with my book again I went into the library for
a moment to refer to another book and when I was in there I heard a
shot At least it was a loud bang I wasnt sure if it was a shot I
stood and listened Then I came slowly to the door and looked out Then
I went back again hesitated a bit you know and finally decided to go
across to the office and make sure that it was all right I turned the
handle of the door and found it was locked Then I got frightened and I
banged at the door and shouted andwell that was when Mr Gillingham
arrived He went on to explain how they had found the body

The inspector looked at him with a smile

Yes well we shall have to go over some of that again Mr Cayley Mr
Mark now You thought he was in the Temple Could he have come in and
gone up to his room without your seeing him

There are back stairs He wouldnt have used them in the ordinary way
of course But I wasnt in the hall all the afternoon He might easily
have gone upstairs without my knowing anything about it

So that you werent surprised when you saw him coming down

Oh not a bit

Well did he say anything

He said Roberts here or something of the sort I suppose hed
heard the bell or the voices in the hall

Which way does his bedroom face Could he have seen him coming down the
drive

He might have yes

Well

Well then I said Yes and he gave a sort of shrug and said Dont
go too far away I might want you and then went in

What did you think he meant by that

Well he consults me a good deal you know Im his sort of unofficial
solicitor in a kind of way

This was a business meeting rather than a brotherly one

Oh yes Thats how he regarded it Im sure

Yes How long was it before you heard the shot

Very soon Two minutes perhaps

The inspector finished his writing and then regarded Cayley
thoughtfully Suddenly he said

What is your theory of Roberts death

Cayley shrugged his shoulders

Youve probably seen more than Ive seen he answered Its your job
I can only speak as a laymanand Marks friend

Well

Then I should say that Robert came here meaning trouble and bringing
a revolver with him He produced it almost at once Mark tried to get
it from him there was a little struggle perhaps and it went off Mark
lost his head finding himself there with a revolver in his hand and
a dead man at his feet His one idea was to escape He locked the door
almost instinctively and then when he heard me hammering at it went
out of the window

Yyes Well that sounds reasonable enough What do you say Mr
Gillingham

I should hardly call it reasonable to lose your head said Antony
getting up from his chair and coming towards them

Well you know what I mean It explains things

Oh yes Any other explanation would make them much more complicated

Have you any other explanation

Not I

Are there any points on which you would like to correct Mr
Cayleyanything that he left out after you arrived here

No thanks He described it all very accurately

Ah Well now about yourself Youre not staying in the house I
gather

Antony explained his previous movements

Yes Did you hear the shot

Antony put his head on one side as if listening Yes Just as I came
in sight of the house It didnt make any impression at the time but I
remember it now

Where were you then

Coming up the drive I was just in sight of the house

Nobody left the house by the front door after the shot

Antony closed his eyes and considered

Nobody he said No

Youre certain of that

Absolutely said Antony as though rather surprised that he could be
suspected of a mistake

Thank you Youre at The George if I want you

Mr Gillingham is staying here until after the inquest explained
Cayley

Good Well now about these servants




CHAPTER V Mr Gillingham Chooses a New Profession


As Cayley went over to the bell Antony got up and moved to the door

Well you wont want me I suppose inspector he said

No thank you Mr Gillingham Youll be about of course

Oh yes

The inspector hesitated

I think Mr Cayley it would be better if I saw the servants alone
You know what they are the more people about the more they get
alarmed I expect I can get at the truth better by myself

Oh quite so In fact I was going to ask you to excuse me I feel
rather responsible towards these guests of ours Although Mr Gillingham
very kindly He smiled at Antony who was waiting at the door and
left his sentence unfinished

Ah that reminds me said the Inspector Didnt you say that one of
your guestsMr Beverley was ita friend of Mr Gillinghams was
staying on

Yes would you like to see him

Afterwards if I may

Ill warn him I shall be up in my room if you want me I have a room
upstairs where I workany of the servants will show you Ah Stevens
Inspector Birch would like to ask you a few questions

Yes sir said Audrey primly but inwardly fluttering The
housekeepers room had heard something of the news by this time and
Audrey had had a busy time explaining to other members of the staff
exactly what he had said and what she had said The details were not
quite established yet but this much at least was certain that Mr
Marks brother had shot himself and spirited Mr Mark away and that
Audrey had seen at once that he was that sort of man when she opened
the door to him She had passed the remark to Mrs Stevens And Mrs
Stevensif you remember Audreyhad always said that people didnt go
away to Australia except for very good reasons Elsie agreed with both
of them but she had a contribution of her own to make She had actually
heard Mr Mark in the office threatening his brother

You mean Mr Robert said the second parlourmaid She had been having
a little nap in her room but she had heard the bang In fact it had
woken her upjust like something going off it was

It was Mr Marks voice said Elsie firmly

Pleading for mercy said an eagereyed kitchenmaid hopefully from the
door and was hurried out again by the others wishing that she had not
given her presence away But it was hard to listen in silence when she
knew so well from her novelettes just what happened on these occasions

I shall have to give that girl a piece of my mind said Mrs Stevens
Well Elsie

He said I heard him say it with my own ears Its my turn now he
said triumphantlike

Well if you think thats a threat dear youre very particular I
must say

But Audrey remembered Elsies words when she was in front of Inspector
Birch She gave her own evidence with the readiness of one who had
already repeated it several times and was examined and crossexamined
by the Inspector with considerable skill The temptation to say Never
mind about what you said to him was strong but he resisted it
knowing that in this way he would discover best what he said to her By
this time both his words and the looks he gave her were getting their
full value from Audrey but the general meaning of them seemed to be
wellestablished

Then you didnt see Mr Mark at all

No sir he must have come in before and gone up to his room Or come
in by the front door likely enough while I was going out by the back

Yes Well I think thats all that I want to know thank you very much
Now what about the other servants

Elsie heard the master and Mr Robert talking together said Audrey
eagerly He was sayingMr Mark I mean

Ah Well I think Elsie had better tell me that herself Who is Elsie
by the way

One of the housemaids Shall I send her to you sir

Please

Elsie was not sorry to get the message It interrupted a few remarks
from Mrs Stevens about Elsies conduct that afternoon which were Elsie
thought much better interrupted In Mrs Stevens opinion any crime
committed that afternoon in the office was as nothing to the double
crime committed by the unhappy Elsie

For Elsie realized too late that she would have done better to have said
nothing about her presence in the hall that afternoon She was bad at
concealing the truth and Mrs Stevens was good at discovering it Elsie
knew perfectly well that she had no business to come down the front
stairs and it was no excuse to say that she happened to come out of
Miss Norris room just at the head of the stairs and didnt think it
would matter as there was nobody in the hall and what was she doing
anyhow in Miss Norris room at that time Returning a magazine Lent by
Miss Norris might she ask Well not exactly lent Really Elsieand
this in a respectable house In vain for poor Elsie to plead that
a story by her favourite author was advertised on the cover with a
picture of the villain falling over the cliff Thats where youll go
to my girl if you arent careful said Mrs Stevens firmly

But of course there was no need to confess all these crimes to
Inspector Birch All that interested him was that she was passing
through the hall and heard voices in the office

And stopped to listen

Certainly not said Elsie with dignity feeling that nobody really
understood her I was just passing through the hall just as you might
have been yourself and not supposing they was talking secrets didnt
think to stop my ears as no doubt I ought to have done And she
sniffed slightly

Come come said the Inspector soothingly I didnt mean to
suggest

Everyone is very unkind to me said Elsie between sniffs and theres
that poor man lying dead there and sorry theyd have been if it had
been me to have spoken to me as they have done this day

Nonsense were going to be very proud of you I shouldnt be surprised
if your evidence were of very great importance Now then what was it
you heard Try to remember the exact words

Something about working in a passage thought Elsie

Yes but who said it

Mr Robert

How do you know it was Mr Robert Had you heard his voice before

I dont take it upon myself to say that I had had any acquaintance with
Mr Robert but seeing that it wasnt Mr Mark nor yet Mr Cayley nor
any other of the gentlemen and Miss Stevens had shown Mr Robert into
the office not five minutes before

Quite so said the Inspector hurriedly Mr Robert undoubtedly
Working in a passage

That was what it sounded like sir

Hm Working a passage overcould that have been it

Thats right sir said Elsie eagerly Hed worked his passage over

Well

And then Mr Mark said loudlysort of triumphantlikeIts my turn
now You wait

Triumphantly

As much as to say his chance had come

And thats all you heard

Thats all sirnot standing there listening but just passing through
the hall as it might be any time

Yes Well thats really very important Elsie Thank you

Elsie gave him a smile and returned eagerly to the kitchen She was
ready for Mrs Stevens or anybody now

Meanwhile Antony had been exploring a little on his own There was a
point which was puzzling him He went through the hall to the front of
the house and stood at the open door looking out on to the drive He
and Cayley had run round the house to the left Surely it would have
been quicker to have run round to the right The front door was not in
the middle of the house it was to the end Undoubtedly they went the
longest way round But perhaps there was something in the way if one
went to the righta wall say He strolled off in that direction
followed a path round the house and came in sight of the office windows
Quite simple and about half the distance of the other way He went on
a little farther and came to a door just beyond the brokenin windows
It opened easily and he found himself in a passage At the end of the
passage was another door He opened it and found himself in the hall
again

And of course thats the quickest way of the three he said to
himself Through the hall and out at the back turn to the left and
there you are Instead of which we ran the longest way round the house
Why Was it to give Mark more time in which to escape Only in that
casewhy run Also how did Cayley know then that it was Mark who
was trying to escape If he had guessedwell not guessed but been
afraidthat one had shot the other it was much more likely that Robert
had shot Mark Indeed he had admitted that this was what he thought
The first thing he had said when he turned the body over was Thank
God I was afraid it was Mark But why should he want to give Robert
time in which to get away And againwhy run if he did want to give
him time

Antony went out of the house again to the lawns at the back and sat
down on a bench in view of the office windows

Now then he said lets go through Cayleys mind carefully and see
what we get

Cayley had been in the hall when Robert was shown into the office The
servant goes off to look for Mark and Cayley goes on with his book
Mark comes down the stairs warns Cayley to stand by in case he is
wanted and goes to meet his brother What does Cayley expect Possibly
that he wont be wanted at all possibly that his advice may be wanted
in the matter say of paying Roberts debts or getting him a passage
back to Australia possibly that his physical assistance may be wanted
to get an obstreperous Robert out of the house Well he sits there for
a moment and then goes into the library Why not He is still within
reach if wanted Suddenly he hears a pistolshot A pistolshot is the
last noise you expect to hear in a countryhouse very natural then
that for the moment he would hardly realize what it was He listensand
hears nothing more Perhaps it wasnt a pistolshot after all After a
moment or two he goes to the library door again The profound silence
makes him uneasy now Was it a pistolshot Absurd Stillno harm in
going into the office on some excuse just to reassure himself So he
tries the doorand finds it locked

What are his emotions now Alarm uncertainty Something is happening
Incredible though it seems it must have been a pistolshot He is
banging at the door and calling out to Mark and there is no answer
Alarmyes But alarm for whose safety Marks obviously Robert is a
stranger Mark is an intimate friend Robert has written a letter that
morning the letter of a man in a dangerous temper Robert is the tough
customer Mark the highly civilized gentleman If there has been a
quarrel it is Robert who has shot Mark He bangs at the door again

Of course to Antony coming suddenly upon this scene Cayleys conduct
had seemed rather absurd but then just for the moment Cayley had lost
his head Anybody else might have done the same But as soon as Antony
suggested trying the windows Cayley saw that that was the obvious thing
to do So he leads the way to the windowsthe longest way

Why To give the murderer time to escape If he had thought then that
Mark was the murderer perhaps yes But he thinks that Robert is the
murderer If he is not hiding anything he must think so Indeed he says
so when he sees the body I was afraid it was Mark he says when he
finds that it is Robert who is killed No reason then for wishing to
gain time On the contrary every instinct would urge him to get into
the room as quickly as possible and seize the wicked Robert Yet he
goes the longest way round Why And then why run

Thats the question said Antony to himself as he filled his pipe
and bless me if I know the answer It may be of course that Cayley is
just a coward He was in no hurry to get close to Roberts revolver and
yet wanted me to think that he was bursting with eagerness That would
explain it but then that makes Cayley out a coward Is he At any rate
he pushed his face up against the window bravely enough No I want a
better answer than that

He sat there with his unlit pipe in his hand thinking There were one
or two other things in the back of his brain waiting to be taken out
and looked at For the moment he left them undisturbed They would come
back to him later when he wanted them

He laughed suddenly and lit his pipe

I was wanting a new profession he thought and now Ive found it
Antony Gillingham our own private sleuthhound I shall begin today

Whatever Antony Gillinghams other qualifications for his new
profession he had at any rate a brain which worked clearly and quickly
And this clear brain of his had already told him that he was the only
person in the house at that moment who was unhandicapped in the search
for truth The inspector had arrived in it to find a man dead and a man
missing It was extremely probable no doubt that the missing man
had shot the dead man But it was more than extremely probable it was
almost certain that the Inspector would start with the idea that this
extremely probable solution was the one true solution and that in
consequence he would be less disposed to consider without prejudice any
other solution As regards all the rest of themCayley the guests
the servantsthey also were prejudiced in favour of Mark or possibly
for all he knew against Mark in favour of or against each other
they had formed some previous opinion from what had been said that
morning of the sort of man Robert was No one of them could consider
the matter with an unbiased mind

But Antony could He knew nothing about Mark he knew nothing about
Robert He had seen the dead man before he was told who the dead man
was He knew that a tragedy had happened before he knew that anybody was
missing Those first impressions which are so vitally important had
been received solely on the merits of the case they were founded on the
evidence of his senses not on the evidence of his emotions or of other
peoples senses He was in a much better position for getting at the
truth than was the Inspector

It is possible that in thinking this Antony was doing Inspector Birch
a slight injustice Birch was certainly prepared to believe that Mark
had shot his brother Robert had been shown into the office witness
Audrey Mark had gone in to Robert witness Cayley Mark and Robert
had been heard talking witness Elsie there was a shot witness
everybody the room had been entered and Roberts body had been found
witness Cayley and Gillingham And Mark was missing Obviously
then Mark had killed his brother accidentally as Cayley believed or
deliberately as Elsies evidence seemed to suggest There was no point
in looking for a difficult solution to a problem when the easy solution
had no flaw in it But at the same time Birch would have preferred the
difficult solution simply because there was more credit attached to
it A sensational arrest of somebody in the house would have given him
more pleasure than a commonplace pursuit of Mark Ablett across
country Mark must be found guilty or not guilty But there were other
possibilities It would have interested Antony to know that just at the
time when he was feeling rather superior to the prejudiced inspector
the Inspector himself was letting his mind dwell lovingly upon
the possibilities in connection with Mr Gillingham Was it only a
coincidence that Mr Gillingham had turned up just when he did And Mr
Beverleys curious answers when asked for some account of his friend
An assistant in a tobacconists a waiter An odd man Mr Gillingham
evidently It might be as well to keep an eye on him




CHAPTER VI Outside Or Inside


The guests had said goodbye to Cayley according to their different
manner The Major gruff and simple If you want me command me
Anything I can doGoodbye Betty silently sympathetic with
everything in her large eyes which she was too much overawed to tell
Mrs Calladine protesting that she did not know what to say but
apparently finding plenty and Miss Norris crowding so much into one
despairing gesture that Cayleys unvarying Thank you very much might
have been taken this time as gratitude for an artistic entertainment

Bill had seen them into the car had taken his own farewells with a
special squeeze of the hand for Betty and had wandered out to join
Antony on his garden seat

Well this is a rum show said Bill as he sat down

Very rum William

And you actually walked right into it

Right into it said Antony

Then youre the man I want There are all sorts of rumours and
mysteries about and that inspector fellow simply wouldnt keep to the
point when I wanted to ask him about the murder or whatever it is but
kept asking me questions about where Id met you first and all sorts of
dull things like that Now what really happened

Antony told him as concisely as he could all that he had already told
the Inspector Bill interrupting him here and there with appropriate
Good Lords and whistles

I say its a bit of a business isnt it Where do I come in
exactly

How do you mean

Well everybody else is bundled off except me and I get put through it
by that inspector as if I knew all about itwhats the idea

Antony smiled at him

Well theres nothing to worry about you know Naturally Birch wanted
to see one of you so as to know what youd all been doing all day And
Cayley was nice enough to think that youd be company for me as I knew
you already And well thats all

Youre staying here in the house said Bill eagerly Good man
Thats splendid

It reconciles you to the departure of some of the others

Bill blushed

Oh well I shall see her again next week anyway he murmured

I congratulate you I liked her looks And that grey dress A nice
comfortable sort of woman

You fool thats her mother

Oh I beg your pardon But anyhow Bill I want you more than she does
just now So try and put up with me

I say do you really said Bill rather flattered He had a great
admiration for Antony and was very proud to be liked by him

Yes You see things are going to happen here soon

Inquests and that sort of thing

Well perhaps something before that Hallo here comes Cayley

Cayley was walking across the lawn towards them a big heavyshouldered
man with one of those strong cleanshaven ugly faces which can never
quite be called plain Bad luck on Cayley said Bill I say ought
I to tell him how sorry I am and all that sort of thing It seems so
dashed inadequate

I shouldnt bother said Antony

Cayley nodded as he came to them and stood there for a moment

We can make room for you said Bill getting up

Oh dont bother thanks I just came to say he went on to Antony
that naturally theyve rather lost their heads in the kitchen
and dinner wont be till halfpast eight Do just as you like about
dressing of course And what about your luggage

I thought Bill and I would walk over to the inn directly and see about
it

The car can go and fetch it as soon as it comes back from the station

Its very good of you but I shall have to go over myself anyhow to
pack up and pay my bill Besides its a good evening for a walk If you
wouldnt mind it Bill

I should love it

Well then if you leave the bag there Ill send the car round for it
later

Thanks very much

Having said what he wanted to say Cayley remained there a little
awkwardly as if not sure whether to go or to stay Antony wondered
whether he wanted to talk about the afternoons happenings or whether
it was the one subject he wished to avoid To break the silence he asked
carelessly if the Inspector had gone

Cayley nodded Then he said abruptly Hes getting a warrant for Marks
arrest

Bill made a suitably sympathetic noise and Antony said with a shrug
of the shoulders Well he was bound to do that wasnt he It doesnt
follow thatwell it doesnt mean anything They naturally want to get
hold of your cousin innocent or guilty

Which do you think he is Mr Gillingham said Cayley looking at him
steadily

Mark Its absurd said Bill impetuously

Bills loyal you see Mr Cayley

And you owe no loyalty to anyone concerned

Exactly So perhaps I might be too frank

Bill had dropped down on the grass and Cayley took his place on the
seat and sat there heavily his elbows on his knees his chin on his
hands gazing at the ground

I want you to be quite frank he said at last Naturally I am
prejudiced where Mark is concerned So I want to know how my suggestion
strikes you who have no prejudices either way

Your suggestion

My theory that if Mark killed his brother it was purely accidental as
I told the Inspector

Bill looked up with interest

You mean that Robert did the holdup business he said and there was
a bit of a struggle and the revolver went off and then Mark lost his
head and bolted That sort of idea

Exactly

Well that seems all right He turned to Antony Theres nothing
wrong with that is there Its the most natural explanation to anyone
who knows Mark

Antony pulled at his pipe

I suppose it is he said slowly But theres one thing that worries
me rather

Whats that Bill and Cayley asked the question simultaneously

The key

The key said Bill

Cayley lifted his head and looked at Antony What about the key he
asked

Well there may be nothing in it I just wondered Suppose Robert was
killed as you say and suppose Mark lost his head and thought of nothing
but getting away before anyone could see him Well very likely
hed lock the door and put the key in his pocket Hed do it without
thinking just to gain a moments time

Yes thats what I suggest

It seems sound enough said Bill Sort of thing youd do without
thinking Besides if you are going to run away it gives you more of a
chance

Yes thats all right if the key is there But suppose it isnt there

The suggestion made as if it were already an established fact startled
them both They looked at him wonderingly

What do you mean said Cayley

Well its just a question of where people happen to keep their keys
You go up to your bedroom and perhaps you like to lock your door in
case anybody comes wandering in when youve only got one sock and a pair
of braces on Well thats natural enough And if you look round the
bedrooms of almost any house youll find the keys all ready so that
you can lock yourself in at a moments notice But downstairs people
dont lock themselves in Its really never done at all Bill for
instance has never locked himself into the diningroom in order to be
alone with the sherry On the other hand all women and particularly
servants have a horror of burglars And if a burglar gets in by the
window they like to limit his activities to that particular room So
they keep the keys on the outside of the doors and lock the doors when
they go to bed He knocked the ashes out of his pipe and added At
least my mother always used to

You mean said Bill excitedly that the key was on the outside of the
door when Mark went into the room

Well I was just wondering

Have you noticed the other roomsthe billiardroom and library and so
on said Cayley

Ive only just thought about it while Ive been sitting out here You
live herehavent you ever noticed them

Cayley sat considering with his head on one side

It seems rather absurd you know but I cant say that I have He
turned to Bill Have you

Good Lord no I should never worry about a thing like that

Im sure you wouldnt laughed Antony Well we can have a look when
we go in If the other keys are outside then this one was probably
outside too and in that case well it makes it more interesting

Cayley said nothing Bill chewed a piece of grass and then said Does
it make much difference

It makes it more hard to understand what happened in there Take your
accidental theory and see where you get to No instinctive turning of
the key now is there Hes got to open the door to get it and opening
the door means showing his head to anybody in the hallhis cousin for
instance whom he left there two minutes ago Is a man in Marks state
of mind frightened to death lest he should be found with the body
going to do anything so foolhardy as that

He neednt have been afraid of me said Cayley

Then why didnt he call for you He knew you were about You could
have advised him Heaven knows he wanted advice But the whole theory
of Marks escape is that he was afraid of you and of everybody else
and that he had no other idea but to get out of the room himself and
prevent you or the servants from coming into it If the key had been on
the inside he would probably have locked the door If it were on the
outside he almost certainly wouldnt

Yes I expect youre right said Bill thoughtfully Unless he took
the key in with him and locked the door at once

Exactly But in that case you have to build up a new theory entirely

You mean that it makes it seem more deliberate

Yes that certainly But it also seems to make Mark out an absolute
idiot Just suppose for a moment that for urgent reasons which neither
of you know anything about he had wished to get rid of his brother
Would he have done it like that Just killed him and then run away Why
thats practically suicidesuicide whilst of unsound mind No If you
really wanted to remove an undesirable brother you would do it a little
bit more cleverly than that Youd begin by treating him as a friend so
as to avoid suspicion and when you did kill him at last you would try
to make it look like an accident or suicide or the work of some other
man Wouldnt you

You mean youd give yourself a bit of a run for your money

Yes thats what I mean If you were going to do it deliberately that
is to say and lock yourself in before you began

Cayley had been silent apparently thinking over this new idea With his
eyes still on the ground he said now I hold to my opinion that it was
purely accidental and that Mark lost his head and ran away

But what about the key asked Bill

We dont know yet that the keys were outside I dont at all agree with
Mr Gillingham that the keys of the downstairs rooms are always outside
the doors Sometimes they are no doubt but I think we shall probably
find that these are inside

Oh well of course if they are inside then your original theory
is probably the correct one Having often seen them outside I just
wondered thats all You asked me to be quite frank you know and tell
you what I thought But no doubt youre right and we shall find them
inside as you say

Even if the key was outside went on Cayley stubbornly I still
think it might have been accidental He might have taken it in with him
knowing that the interview would be an unpleasant one and not wishing
to be interrupted

But he had just told you to stand by in case he wanted you so why
should he lock you out Besides I should think that if a man were going
to have an unpleasant interview with a threatening relation the last
thing he would do would be to barricade himself in with him He would
want to open all the doors and say Get out of it

Cayley was silent but his mouth looked obstinate Antony gave a little
apologetic laugh and stood up

Well come on Bill he said we ought to be stepping He held out a
hand and pulled his friend up Then turning to Cayley he went on You
must forgive me if I have let my thoughts run on rather Of course I
was considering the matter purely as an outsider just as a problem I
mean which didnt concern the happiness of any of my friends

Thats all right Mr Gillingham said Cayley standing up too It
is for you to make allowances for me Im sure you will You say that
youre going up to the inn now about your bag

Yes He looked up at the sun and then round the parkland stretching
about the house Let me see its over in that direction isnt it He
pointed southwards Can we get to the village that way or must we go
by the road

Ill show you my boy said Bill

Bill will show you The park reaches almost as far as the village Then
Ill send the car round in about half an hour

Thanks very much

Cayley nodded and turned to go into the house Antony took hold of
Bills arm and walked off with him in the opposite direction




CHAPTER VII Portrait of a Gentleman


They walked in silence for a little until they had left the house and
gardens well behind them In front of them and to the right the park
dipped and then rose slowly shutting out the rest of the world A thick
belt of trees on the left divided them from the main road

Ever been here before said Antony suddenly

Oh rather Dozens of times

I meant just here where we are now Or do you stay indoors and play
billiards all the time

Oh Lord no

Well tennis and things So many people with beautiful parks never by
any chance use them and all the poor devils passing by on the dusty
road think how lucky the owners are to have them and imagine them doing
all sorts of jolly things inside He pointed to the right Ever been
over there

Bill laughed as if a little ashamed

Well not very much Ive often been along here of course because
its the short way to the village

Yes All right now tell me something about Mark

What sort of things

Well never mind about his being your host or about your being a
perfect gentleman or anything like that Cut out the Manners for Men
and tell me what you think of Mark and how you like staying with him
and how many rows your little houseparty has had this week and how you
get on with Cayley and all the rest of it

Bill looked at him eagerly

I say are you being the complete detective

Well I wanted a new profession smiled the other

What fun I mean he corrected himself apologetically one oughtnt
to say that when theres a man dead in the house and ones host
He broke off a little uncertainly and then rounded off his period by
saying again By Jove what a rum show it is Good Lord

Well said Antony Carry on Mark

What do I think of him

Yes

Bill was silent wondering how to put into words thoughts which had
never formed themselves very definitely in his own mind What did he
think of Mark Seeing his hesitation Antony said

I ought to have warned you that nothing that you say will be taken down
by the reporters so you neednt bother about a split infinitive or two
Talk about anything you like how you like Well Ill give you a start
Which do you enjoy more a weekend here or at the Barringtons say

Well of course that would depend

Take it that she was there in both cases

Ass said Bill putting an elbow into Antonys ribs Its a little
difficult to say he went on Of course they do you awfully well
here

Yes

I dont think I know any house where things are so comfortable Ones
roomthe fooddrinkscigarsthe way everythings arranged All that
sort of thing They look after you awfully well

Yes

Yes He repeated it slowly to himself as if it had given him a new
idea They look after you awfully well Well thats just what it is
about Mark Thats one of his little ways Weaknesses Looking after
you

Arranging things for you

Yes Of course its a delightful house and theres plenty to do and
opportunities for every game or sport thats ever been invented and
as I say one gets awfully well done but with it all Tony theres
a faint sort of feeling that well that one is on parade as it were
Youve got to do as youre told

How do you mean

Well Mark fancies himself rather at arranging things He arranges
things and its understood that the guests fall in with the
arrangement For instance BettyMiss Calladineand I were going to
play a single just before tea the other day Tennis Shes frightfully
hot stuff at tennis and backed herself to take me on level Im rather
erratic you know Mark saw us going out with our rackets and asked us
what we were going to do Well hed got up a little tournament for
us after teahandicaps all arranged by him and everything ruled out
neatly in red and black inkprizes and allquite decent ones you
know Hed had the lawn specially cut and marked for it Well of course
Betty and I wouldnt have spoilt the court and wed have been quite
ready to play again after teaI had to give her halffifteen according
to his handicapbut somehow Bill stopped and shrugged his shoulders

It didnt quite fit in

No It spoilt the effect of his tournament Took the edge off it just
a little I suppose he felt So we didnt play He laughed and added
It would have been as much as our place was worth to have played

Do you mean you wouldnt have been asked here again

Probably Well I dont know Not for some time anyway

Really Bill

Oh rather Hes a devil for taking offence That Miss Norris did you
see her Shes done for herself I dont mind betting what you like that
she never comes here again

Why

Bill laughed to himself

We were all in it reallyat least Betty and I were Theres supposed
to be a ghost attached to the house Lady Anne Patten Ever heard of
her

Never

Mark told us about her at dinner one night He rather liked the idea
of there being a ghost in his house you know except that he doesnt
believe in ghosts I think he wanted all of us to believe in her and
yet he was annoyed with Betty and Mrs Calladine for believing in ghosts
at all Rum chap Well anyhow Miss Norrisshes an actress some
actress toodressed up as the ghost and played the fool a bit And poor
Mark was frightened out of his life Just for a moment you know

What about the others

Well Betty and I knew in fact Id told herMiss Norris I meannot
to be a silly ass Knowing Mark Mrs Calladine wasnt thereBetty
wouldnt let her be As for the Major I dont believe anything would
frighten him

Where did the ghost appear

Down by the bowlinggreen Thats supposed to be its haunt you know
We were all down there in the moonlight pretending to wait for it Do
you know the bowlinggreen

No

Ill show it to you after dinner

I wish you would Was Mark very angry afterwards

Oh Lord yes Sulked for a whole day Well hes just like that

Was he angry with all of you

Oh yes sulky you know

This morning

Oh no He got over ithe generally does Hes just like a child
Thats really it Tony hes like a child in some ways As a matter of
fact he was unusually bucked with himself this morning And yesterday

Yesterday

Rather We all said wed never seen him in such form

Is he generally in form

Hes quite good company you know if you take him the right way
Hes rather vain and childish well like Ive been telling you and
selfimportant but quite amusing in his way and Bill broke off
suddenly I say you know it really is the limit talking about your
host like this

Dont think of him as your host Think of him as a suspected murderer
with a warrant out against him

Oh but thats all rot you know

Its the fact Bill

Yes but I mean he didnt do it He wouldnt murder anybody Its a
funny thing to say but well hes not big enough for it Hes got his
faults like all of us but they arent on that scale

One can kill anybody in a childish fit of temper

Bill grunted assent but without prejudice to Mark All the same he
said I cant believe it That he would do it deliberately I mean

Suppose it was an accident as Cayley says would he lose his head and
run away

Bill considered for a moment

Yes I really think he might you know He nearly ran away when he saw
the ghost Of course thats different rather

Oh I dont know In each case its a question of obeying your instinct
instead of your reason

They had left the open land and were following a path through the
bordering trees Two abreast was uncomfortable so Antony dropped
behind and further conversation was postponed until they were outside
the boundary fence and in the high road The road sloped gently down to
the village of Waldheima few redroofed cottages and the grey tower of
a church showing above the green

Well now said Antony as they stepped out more quickly what about
Cayley

How do you mean what about him

I want to see him I can see Mark perfectly thanks to you Bill You
were wonderful Now lets have Cayleys character Cayley from within

Bill laughed in pleased embarrassment and protested that he was not a
blooming novelist

Besides he added Marks easy Cayleys one of these heavy quiet
people who might be thinking about anything Mark gives himself
away Ugly blackjawed devil isnt he

Some women like that type of ugliness

Yes thats true Between ourselves I think theres one here who does
Rather a pretty girl at Jallands he waved his left hand down that
way

Whats Jallands

Well I suppose it used to be a farm belonging to a bloke called
Jalland but now its a country cottage belonging to a widow called
Norbury Mark and Cayley used to go there a good deal together Miss
Norburythe girlhas been here once or twice for tennis seemed to
prefer Cayley to the rest of us But of course he hadnt much time for
that sort of thing

What sort of thing

Walking about with a pretty girl and asking her if shes been to any
theatres lately He nearly always had something to do

Mark kept him busy

Yes Mark never seemed quite happy unless he had Cayley doing something
for him He was quite lost and helpless without him And funnily
enough Cayley seemed lost without Mark

He was fond of him

Yes I should say so In a protective kind of way Hed sized Mark up
of course his vanity his selfimportance his amateurishness and all
the rest of it but he liked looking after him And he knew how to manage
him

Yes What sort of terms was he on with the guestsyou and Miss
Norris and all of them

Just polite and rather silent you know Keeping himself to himself We
didnt see so very much of him except at meals We were here to enjoy
ourselves and well he wasnt

He wasnt there when the ghost walked

No I heard Mark calling for him when he went back to the house I
expect Cayley stroked down his feathers a bit and told him that girls
will be girlsHallo here we are

They went into the inn and while Bill made himself pleasant to the
landlady Antony went upstairs to his room It appeared that he had not
very much packing to do after all He returned his brushes to his bag
glanced round to see that nothing else had been taken out and went down
again to settle his bill He had decided to keep on his room for a few
days partly to save the landlord and his wife the disappointment of
losing a guest so suddenly partly in case he found it undesirable later
on to remain at the Red House For he was taking himself seriously as a
detective indeed he took himself seriously while getting all the fun
out of it which was possible at every new profession he adopted and he
felt that there might come a timeafter the inquestsay when he could
not decently remain at the Red House as a guest a friend of Bills
enjoying the hospitality of Mark or Cayley whichever was to be regarded
as his host without forfeiting his independent attitude towards the
events of that afternoon At present he was staying in the house merely
as a necessary witness and since he was there Cayley could not object
to him using his eyes but if after the inquest it appeared that there
was still work for a pair of independent and very keen eyes to do then
he must investigate either with his hosts approval or from beneath the
roof of some other host the landlord of The George for instance who
had no feelings in the matter

For of one thing Antony was certain Cayley knew more than he professed
to know That is to say he knew more than he wanted other people to
know he knew Antony was one of the other people if therefore he
was for trying to find out what it was that Cayley knew he could hardly
expect Cayleys approval of his labours It would be The George then
for Antony after the inquest

What was the truth Not necessarily discreditable to Cayley even though
he were hiding something All that could be said against him at the
moment was that he had gone the longest way round to get into the locked
office and that this did not fit in with what he had told the Inspector
But it did fit in with the theory that he had been an accessory after
the event and that he wanted while appearing to be in a hurry to give
his cousin as much time as possible in which to escape That might not
be the true solution but it was at least a workable one The theory
which he had suggested to the Inspector was not

However there would be a day or two before the inquest in which Antony
could consider all these matters from within The Red House The car was
at the door He got in with Bill the landlord put his bag on the front
seat next to the chauffeur and they drove back




CHAPTER VIII Do You Follow Me Watson


Antonys bedroom looked over the park at the back of the house The
blinds were not yet drawn while he was changing his clothes for dinner
and at various stages of undress he would pause and gaze out of the
window sometimes smiling to himself sometimes frowning as he turned
over in his mind all the strange things that he had seen that day He
was sitting on his bed in shirt and trousers absently smoothing down
his thick black hair with his brushes when Bill shouted an Hallo
through the door and came in

I say buck up old boy Im hungry he said

Antony stopped smoothing himself and looked up at him thoughtfully

Wheres Mark he said

Mark You mean Cayley

Antony corrected himself with a little laugh Yes I mean Cayley Is
he down I say I shant be a moment Bill He got up from the bed and
went on briskly with his dressing Oh by the way said Bill taking
his place on the bed your idea about the keys is a washout

Why how do you mean

I went down just now and had a look at them We were asses not to have
thought of it when we came in The library key is outside but all the
others are inside

Yes I know

You devil I suppose you did think of it then

I did Bill said Antony apologetically

Bother I hoped youd forgotten Well that knocks your theory on the
head doesnt it

I never had a theory I only said that if they were outside it would
probably mean that the office key was outside and that in that case
Cayleys theory was knocked on the head

Well now it isnt and we dont know anything Some were outside and
some inside and there you are It makes it much less exciting When you
were talking about it on the lawn I really got quite keen on the idea
of the key being outside and Mark taking it in with him

Its going to be exciting enough said Antony mildly as he
transferred his pipe and tobacco into the pocket of his black coat
Well lets come down Im ready now

Cayley was waiting for them in the hall He made some polite inquiry
as to the guests comfort and the three of them fell into a casual
conversation about houses in general and The Red House in particular

You were quite right about the keys said Bill during a pause He was
less able than the other two perhaps because he was younger than they
to keep away from the subject which was uppermost in the minds of them
all

Keys said Cayley blankly

We were wondering whether they were outside or inside

Oh oh yes He looked slowly round the hall at the different doors
and then smiled in a friendly way at Antony We both seem to have been
right Mr Gillingham So we dont get much farther

No He gave a shrug I just wondered you know I thought it was
worth mentioning

Oh quite Not that you would have convinced me you know Just as
Elsies evidence doesnt convince me

Elsie said Bill excitedly Antony looked inquiringly at him
wondering who Elsie was

One of the housemaids explained Cayley You didnt hear what she
told the Inspector Of course as I told Birch girls of that class make
things up but he seemed to think she was genuine

What was it said Bill

Cayley told them of what Elsie had heard through the office door that
afternoon

You were in the library then of course said Antony rather to
himself than to the other She might have gone through the hall without
your hearing

Oh Ive no doubt she was there and heard voices Perhaps heard those
very words But He broke off and then added impatiently It was
accidental I know it was accidental Whats the good of talking as if
Mark was a murderer Dinner was announced at that moment and as they
went in he added Whats the good of talking about it at all if it
comes to that

What indeed said Antony and to Bills great disappointment they
talked of books and politics during the meal

Cayley made an excuse for leaving them as soon as their cigars were
alight He had business to attend to as was natural Bill would look
after his friend Bill was only too willing He offered to beat
Antony at billiards to play him at piquet to show him the garden by
moonlight or indeed to do anything else with him that he required

Thank the Lord youre here he said piously I couldnt have stood it
alone

Lets go outside suggested Antony Its quite warm Somewhere where
we can sit down right away from the house I want to talk to you

Good man What about the bowlinggreen

Oh you were going to show me that anyhow werent you Is it
somewhere where we can talk without being overheard

Rather The ideal place Youll see

They came out of the front door and followed the drive to the left
Coming from Waldheim Antony had approached the house that afternoon
from the other side The way they were going now would take them out
at the opposite end of the park on the high road to Stanton a country
town some three miles away They passed by a gate and a gardeners
lodge which marked the limit of what auctioneers like to call the
ornamental grounds of the estate and then the open park was before
them

Sure we havent missed it said Antony The park lay quietly in the
moonlight on either side of the drive wearing a little way ahead
of them a deceptive air of smoothness which retreated always as they
advanced

Rum isnt it said Bill An absurd place for a bowling green but I
suppose it was always here

Yes but always where Its short enough for golf perhaps
butHallo

They had come to the place The road bent round to the right but they
kept straight on over a broad grass path for twenty yards and there
in front of them was the green A dry ditch ten feet wide and six
feet deep surrounded it except in the one place where the path went
forward Two or three grass steps led down to the green on which there
was a long wooden beach for the benefit of spectators

Yes it hides itself very nicely said Antony Where do you keep the
bowls

In a sort of summer house place Round here

They walked along the edge of the green until they came to ita low
wooden bunk which had been built into one wall of the ditch

Hm Jolly view

Bill laughed

Nobody sits there Its just for keeping things out of the rain

They finished their circuit of the green Just in case anybodys in the
ditch said Antony and then sat down on the bench

Now then said Bill We are alone Fire ahead

Antony smoked thoughtfully for a little Then he took his pipe out of
his mouth and turned to his friend

Are you prepared to be the complete Watson he asked

Watson

DoyoufollowmeWatson that one Are you prepared to have quite
obvious things explained to you to ask futile questions to give me
chances of scoring off you to make brilliant discoveries of your own
two or three days after I have made them myselfall that kind of thing
Because it all helps

My dear Tony said Bill delightedly need you ask Antony said
nothing and Bill went on happily to himself I perceive from the
strawberrymark on your shirtfront that you had strawberries for
dessert Holmes you astonish me Tut tut you know my methods Where
is the tobacco The tobacco is in the Persian slipper Can I leave my
practice for a week I can

Antony smiled and went on smoking After waiting hopefully for a minute
or two Bill said in a firm voice

Well then Holmes I feel bound to ask you if you have deduced
anything Also whom do you suspect

Antony began to talk

Do you remember he said one of Holmess little scores over Watson
about the number of steps up to the Baker Street lodging Poor old
Watson had been up and down them a thousand times but he had never
thought of counting them whereas Holmes had counted them as a matter of
course and knew that there were seventeen And that was supposed to
be the difference between observation and nonobservation Watson was
crushed again and Holmes appeared to him more amazing than ever Now
it always seemed to me that in that matter Holmes was the ass and
Watson the sensible person What on earth is the point of keeping in
your head an unnecessary fact like that If you really want to know
at any time the number of steps to your lodging you can ring up your
landlady and ask her Ive been up and down the steps of the club a
thousand times but if you asked me to tell you at this moment how many
steps there are I couldnt do it Could you

I certainly couldnt said Bill

But if you really wanted to know said Antony casually with a sudden
change of voice I could find out for you without even bothering to
ring up the hallporter

Bill was puzzled as to why they were talking about the club steps but
he felt it his duty to say that he did want to know how many they were

Right said Antony Ill find out

He closed his eyes

Im walking up St James Street he said slowly Now Ive come to the
club and Im going past the smokingroomwindowsonetwothreefour
Now Im at the steps I turn in and begin going up them
Onetwothreefourfivesix then a broad step sixseveneightnine
another broad step nineteneleven ElevenIm inside Good morning
Rogers Fine day again With a little start he opened his eyes and came
back again to his present surroundings He turned to Bill with a smile
Eleven he said Count them the next time youre there Eleven and
now I hope I shall forget it again

Bill was distinctly interested

Thats rather hot he said Expound

Well I cant explain it whether its something in the actual eye or
something in the brain or what but I have got rather an uncanny habit
of recording things unconsciously You know that game where you look at
a tray full of small objects for three minutes and then turn away and
try to make a list of them It means a devil of a lot of concentration
for the ordinary person if he wants to get his list complete but in
some odd way I manage to do it without concentration at all I mean that
my eyes seem to do it without the brain consciously taking any part I
could look at the tray for instance and talk to you about golf at the
same time and still get my list right

I should think thats rather a useful gift for an amateur detective
You ought to have gone into the profession before

Well it is rather useful Its rather surprising you know to a
stranger Lets surprise Cayley with it shall we

How

Well lets ask him Antony stopped and looked at Bill comically
lets ask him what hes going to do with the key of the office

For a moment Bill did not understand

Key of the office he said vaguely You dont meanTony What do you
mean Good God do you mean that CayleyBut what about Mark

I dont know where Mark isthats another thing I want to knowbut
Im quite certain that he hasnt got the key of the office with him
Because Cayleys got it

Are you sure

Quite

Bill looked at him wonderingly

I say he said almost pleadingly dont tell me that you can see
into peoples pockets and all that sort of thing as well

Antony laughed and denied it cheerfully

Then how do you know

Youre the perfect Watson Bill You take to it quite naturally
Properly speaking I oughtnt to explain till the last chapter but I
always think that thats so unfair So here goes Of course I dont
really know that hes got it but I do know that he had it I know that
when I came on him this afternoon he had just locked the door and put
the key in his pocket

You mean you saw him at the time but that youve only just remembered
itreconstructed it in the way you were explaining just now

No I didnt see him But I did see something I saw the key of the
billiardroom

Where

Outside the billiardroom door

Outside But it was inside when we looked just now

Exactly

Who put it there

Obviously Cayley

But

Lets go back to this afternoon I dont remember noticing the
billiardroom key at the time I must have done so without knowing
Probably when I saw Cayley banging at the door I may have wondered
subconsciously whether the key of the room next to it would fit
Something like that I daresay Well when I was sitting out by myself
on that seat just before you came along I went over the whole scene in
my mind and I suddenly saw the billiardroom key there outside And I
began to wonder if the officekey had been outside too When Cayley came
up I told you my idea and you were both interested But Cayley was just
a shade too interested I daresay you didnt notice it but he was

By Jove

Well of course that proved nothing and the key business didnt really
prove anything because whatever side of the door the other keys were
Mark might have locked his own private room from the inside sometimes
But I piled it on and pretended that it was enormously important and
quite altered the case altogether and having got Cayley thoroughly
anxious about it I told him that we should be well out of the way for
the next hour or so and that he would be alone in the house to do what
he liked about it And as I expected he couldnt resist it He altered
the keys and gave himself away entirely

But the library key was still outside Why didnt he alter that

Because hes a clever devil For one thing the Inspector had been
in the library and might possibly have noticed it already And for
another Antony hesitated

What said Bill after waiting for him to go on

Its only guesswork But I fancy that Cayley was thoroughly upset about
the key business He suddenly realized that he had been careless and
he hadnt got time to think it all over So he didnt want to commit
himself definitely to the statement that the key was either outside or
inside He wanted to leave it vague It was safest that way

I see said Bill slowly

But his mind was elsewhere He was wondering suddenly about Cayley
Cayley was just an ordinary manlike himself Bill had had little jokes
with him sometimes not that Cayley was much of a hand at joking
Bill had helped him to sausages played tennis with him borrowed his
tobacco lent him a putter and here was Antony saying that he was
what Well not an ordinary man anyway A man with a secret Perhaps
a murderer No not a murderer not Cayley That was rot anyway Why
they had played tennis together

Now then Watson said Antony suddenly Its time you said
something

I say Tony do you really mean it

Mean what

About Cayley

I mean what I said Bill No more

Well what does it amount to

Simply that Robert Ablett died in the office this afternoon and that
Cayley knows exactly how he died Thats all It doesnt follow that
Cayley killed him

No No of course it doesnt Bill gave a sigh of relief Hes just
shielding Mark what

I wonder

Well isnt that the simplest explanation

Its the simplest if youre a friend of Cayley and want to let him down
lightly But then Im not you see

Why isnt it simple anyhow

Well lets have the explanation then and Ill undertake to give you
a simpler one afterwards Go on Only remember the key is on the outside
of the door to start with

Yes well I dont mind that Mark goes in to see his brother and they
quarrel and all the rest of it just as Cayley was saying Cayley hears
the shot and in order to give Mark time to get away locks the door
puts the key in his pocket and pretends that Mark has locked the door
and that he cant get in Hows that

Hopeless Watson hopeless

Why

How does Cayley know that it is Mark who has shot Robert and not the
other way round

Oh said Bill rather upset Yes He thought for a moment All
right Say that Cayley has gone into the room first and seen Robert on
the ground

Well

Well there you are

And what does he say to Mark That its a fine afternoon and could he
lend him a pockethandkerchief Or does he ask him whats happened

Well of course I suppose he asks what happened said Bill
reluctantly

And what does Mark say

Explains that the revolver went off accidentally during a struggle

Whereupon Cayley shields him by doing what Bill Encouraging him to do
the damn silliest thing that any man could possibly doconfess his guilt
by running away

No thats rather hopeless isnt it Bill thought again Well
he said reluctantly suppose Mark confessed that hed murdered his
brother

Thats better Bill Dont be afraid of getting away from the accident
idea Well then your new theory is this Mark confesses to Cayley
that he shot Robert on purpose and Cayley decides even at the risk of
committing perjury and getting into trouble himself to help Mark to
escape Is that right

Bill nodded

Well then I want to ask you two questions First is it possible as I
said before dinner that any man would commit such an idiotic murdera
murder that puts the rope so very tightly round his neck Secondly if
Cayley is prepared to perjure himself for Mark as he has to anyway
now wouldnt it be simpler for him to say that he was in the office
all the time and that Roberts death was accidental

Bill considered this carefully and then nodded slowly again

Yes my simple explanation is a washout he said Now lets have
yours

Antony did not answer him He had begun to think about something quite
different




CHAPTER IX Possibilities of a Croquet Set


Whats the matter said Bill sharply

Antony looked round at him with raised eyebrows

Youve thought of something suddenly said Bill What is it

Antony laughed

My dear Watson he said you arent supposed to be as clever as
this

Oh you cant take me in

No Well I was wondering about this ghost of yours Bill It seems
to me

Oh that Bill was profoundly disappointed What on earth has the
ghost got to do with it

I dont know said Antony apologetically I dont know what anything
has got to do with it I was just wondering You shouldnt have brought
me here if you hadnt wanted me to think about the ghost This is where
she appeared isnt it

Yes Bill was distinctly short about it

How

What

I said How

How How do ghosts appear I dont know They just appear

Over four or five hundred yards of open park

Well but she had to appear here because this is where the original
oneLady Anne you knowwas supposed to walk

Oh never mind Lady Anne A real ghost can do anything But how did
Miss Norris appear suddenly over five hundred yards of bare park

Bill looked at Antony with open mouth

II dont know he stammered We never thought of that

You would have seen her long before wouldnt you if she had come the
way we came

Of course we should

And that would have spoilt it rather You would have had time to
recognize her walk

Bill was interested now

Thats rather funny you know Tony We none of us thought of that

Youre sure she didnt come across the park when none of you were
looking

Quite Because you see Betty and I were expecting her and we kept
looking round in case we saw her so that we should all be playing with
our backs to her

You and Miss Calladine were playing together

I say however do you know that

Brilliant deductive reasoning Well then you suddenly saw her

Yes she walked across that side of the lawn He indicated the
opposite side nearer to the house

She couldnt have been hiding in the ditch Do you call it the moat by
the way

Mark does We dont among ourselves No she couldnt Betty and I
were here before the others and walked round a bit We should have seen
her

Then she must have been hiding in the shed Or do you call it the
summerhouse

We had to go there for the bowls of course She couldnt have been
there

Oh

Its dashed funny said Bill after an interval for thought But it
doesnt matter does it It has nothing to do with Robert

Hasnt it

I say has it said Bill getting excited again

I dont know We dont know what has or what hasnt But it has
got something to do with Miss Norris And Miss Norris He broke off
suddenly

What about her

Well youre all in it in a kind of way And if something unaccountable
happens to one of you a day or two before something unaccountable
happens to the whole house one is well interested It was a good
enough reason but it wasnt the reason he had been on the point of
giving

I see Well

Antony knocked out his pipe and got up slowly

Well then lets find the way from the house by which Miss Norris
came

Bill jumped up eagerly

By Jove Do you mean theres a secret passage

A secluded passage anyway There must be

I say what fun I love secret passages Good Lord and this afternoon
I was playing golf just like an ordinary merchant What a life Secret
passages

They made their way down into the ditch If an opening was to be found
which led to the house it would probably be on the house side of the
green and on the outside of the ditch The most obvious place at which
to begin the search was the shed where the bowls were kept It was a
tidy place as anything in Marks establishment would be There were two
boxes of croquet things one of them with the lid open as if the
balls and mallets and hoops neatly enough put away though had been
recently used a box of bowls a small lawnmower a roller and so
forth A seat ran along the back of it whereon the bowlsplayers could
sit when it rained

Antony tapped the wall at the back

This is where the passage ought to begin It doesnt sound very hollow
does it

It neednt begin here at all need it said Bill walking round with
bent head and tapping the other walls He was just too tall to stand
upright in the shed

Theres only one reason why it should and that is that it would save
us the trouble of looking anywhere else for it Surely Mark didnt
let you play croquet on his bowlinggreen He pointed to the croquet
things

He didnt encourage it at one time but this year he got rather keen
about it Theres really nowhere else to play Personally I hate the
game He wasnt very keen on bowls you know but he liked calling it
the bowlinggreen and surprising his visitors with it

Antony laughed

I love you on Mark he said Youre priceless

He began to feel in his pockets for his pipe and tobacco and then
suddenly stopped and stiffened to attention For a moment he stood
listening with his head on one side holding up a finger to bid Bill
listen too

What is it whispered Bill

Antony waved him to silence and remained listening Very quietly he
went down on his knees and listened again Then he put his ear to the
floor He got up and dusted himself quickly walked across to Bill and
whispered in his ear

Footsteps Somebody coming When I begin to talk back me up

Bill nodded Antony gave him an encouraging pat on the back and stepped
firmly across to the box of bowls whistling loudly to himself He took
the bowls out dropped one with a loud bang on the floor said Oh
Lord and went on

I say Bill I dont think I want to play bowls after all

Well why did you say you did grumbled Bill

Antony flashed a smile of appreciation at him

Well I wanted to when I said I did and now I dont want to

Then what do you want to do

Talk

Oh righto said Bill eagerly

Theres a seat on the lawnI saw it Lets bring these things along in
case we want to play after all

Righto said Bill again He felt safe with that not wishing to
commit himself until he knew what he was wanted to say

As they went across the lawn Antony dropped the bowls and took out his
pipe

Got a match he said loudly

As he bent his head over the match he whispered Therell be somebody
listening to us You take the Cayley view and then went on in his
ordinary voice I dont think much of your matches Bill and struck
another They walked over to the seat and sat down

What a heavenly night said Antony

Ripping

I wonder where that poor devil Mark is now

Its a rum business

You agree with Cayley that it was an accident

Yes You see I know Mark

Hm Antony produced a pencil and a piece of paper and began to write
on his knee but while he wrote he talked He said that he thought Mark
had shot his brother in a fit of anger and that Cayley knew or anyhow
guessed this and had tried to give his cousin a chance of getting away

Mind you I think hes right I think its what any of us would do I
shant give it away of course but somehow there are one or two little
things which make me think that Mark really did shoot his brotherI mean
other than accidentally

Murdered him

Well manslaughtered him anyway I may be wrong Anyway its not my
business

But why do you think so Because of the keys

Oh the keys are a washout Still it was a brilliant idea of mine
Wasnt it And it would have been rather a score for me if they had all
been outside

He had finished his writing and now passed the paper over to Bill In
the clear moonlight the carefully printed letters could easily be read

GO ON TALKING AS IF I WERE HERE AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO TURN ROUND AS
IF I WERE SITTING ON THE GRASS BEHIND YOU BUT GO ON TALKING

I know you dont agree with me Antony went on as Bill read but
youll see that Im right

Bill looked up and nodded eagerly He had forgotten golf and Betty and
all the other things which had made up his world lately This was the
real thing This was life Well he began deliberately the whole
point is that I know Mark Now Mark

But Antony was off the seat and letting himself gently down into the
ditch His intention was to crawl round it until the shed came in sight
The footsteps which he had heard seemed to be underneath the shed
probably there was a trapdoor of some kind in the floor Whoever it was
would have heard their voices and would probably think it worth while
to listen to what they were saying He might do this merely by opening
the door a little without showing himself in which case Antony would
have found the entrance to the passage without any trouble to himself
But when Bill turned his head and talked over the back of the seat it
was probable that the listener would find it necessary to put his head
outside in order to hear and then Antony would be able to discover
who it was Moreover if he should venture out of his hidingplace
altogether and peep at them over the top of the bank the fact that Bill
was talking over the back of the seat would mislead the watcher into
thinking that Antony was still there sitting on the grass no doubt
behind the seat swinging his legs over the side of the ditch

He walked quickly but very silently along the halflength of the
bowlinggreen to the first corner passed cautiously round and then
went even more carefully along the width of it to the second corner
He could hear Bill hard at it arguing from his knowledge of Marks
character that this that and the other must have happened and he
smiled appreciatively to himself Bill was a great conspirator worth a
hundred Watsons As he approached the second corner he slowed down and
did the last few yards on hands and knees Then lying at full length
inch by inch his head went round the corner

The shed was two or three yards to his left on the opposite side of
the ditch From where he lay he could see almost entirely inside it
Everything seemed to be as they left it The bowlsbox the lawnmower
the roller the open croquetbox the

By Jove said Antony to himself thats neat

The lid of the other croquetbox was open too Bill was turning round
now his voice became more difficult to hear You see what I mean he
was saying If Cayley

And out of the second croquetbox came Cayleys black head

Antony wanted to shout his applause It was neat devilish neat For a
moment he gazed fascinated at that wonderful new kind of croquetball
which had appeared so dramatically out of the box and then reluctantly
wriggled himself back There was nothing to be gained by staying there
and a good deal to be lost for Bill showed signs of running down As
quickly as he could Antony hurried round the ditch and took up his place
at the back of the seat Then he stood up with a yawn stretched himself
and said carelessly Well dont worry yourself about it Bill old
man I daresay youre right You know Mark and I dont and thats the
difference Shall we have a game or shall we go to bed

Bill looked at him for inspiration and receiving it said Oh just
lets have one game shall we

Right you are said Antony

But Bill was much too excited to take the game which followed very
seriously Antony on the other hand seemed to be thinking of nothing
but bowls He played with great deliberation for ten minutes and then
announced that he was going to bed Bill looked at him anxiously

Its all right laughed Antony You can talk if you want to Just
lets put em away first though

They made their way down to the shed and while Bill was putting the
bowls away Antony tried the lid of the closed croquetbox As he
expected it was locked

Now then said Bill as they were walking back to the house again
Im simply bursting to know Who was it

Cayley

Good Lord Where

Inside one of the croquetboxes

Dont be an ass

Its quite true Bill He told the other what he had seen

But arent we going to have a look at it asked Bill in great
disappointment Im longing to explore Arent you

Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow We shall see Cayley coming along
this way directly Besides I want to get in from the other end if I
can I doubt very much if we can do it this end without giving ourselves
away Look theres Cayley

They could see him coming along the drive towards them When they were a
little closer they waved to him and he waved back

I wondered where you were he said as he got up to them I rather
thought you might be along this way What about bed

Bed it is said Antony

Weve been playing bowls added Bill and talking andand playing
bowls Ripping night isnt it

But he left the rest of the conversation as they wandered back to the
house to Antony He wanted to think There seemed to be no doubt now
that Cayley was a villain Bill had never been familiar with a villain
before It didnt seem quite fair of Cayley somehow he was taking
rather a mean advantage of his friends Lot of funny people there were
in the worldfunny people with secrets Look at Tony that first time he
had met him in a tobacconists shop Anybody would have thought he was
a tobacconists assistant And Cayley Anybody would have thought that
Cayley was an ordinary decent sort of person And Mark Dash it one
could never be sure of anybody Now Robert was different Everybody had
always said that Robert was a shady fellow

But what on earth had Miss Norris got to do with it What had Miss
Norris got to do with it This was a question which Antony had already
asked himself that afternoon and it seemed to him now that he had found
the answer As he lay in bed that night he reassembled his ideas and
looked at them in the new light which the events of the evening threw
upon the dark corners in his brain

Of course it was natural that Cayley should want to get rid of his
guests as soon as the tragedy was discovered He would want this for
their own sake as well as for his But he had been a little too quick
about suggesting it and about seeing the suggestion carried out They
had been bustled off as soon as they could be packed The suggestion
that they were in his hands to go or stay as he wished could have been
left safely to them As it was they had been given no alternative
and Miss Norris who had proposed to catch an afterdinner train at the
junction in the obvious hope that she might have in this way a
dramatic crossexamination at the hands of some keeneyed detective was
encouraged tactfully but quite firmly to travel by the earlier train
with the others Antony had felt that Cayley in the tragedy which had
suddenly befallen the house ought to have been equally indifferent to
her presence or absence But he was not and Antony assumed from this
that Cayley was very much alive to the necessity for her absence

Why

Well that question was not to be answered offhand But the fact that
it was so had made Antony interested in her and it was for this reason
that he had followed up so alertly Bills casual mention of her in
connection with the dressingup business He felt that he wanted to know
a little more about Miss Norris and the part she had played in the Red
House circle By sheer luck as it seemed to him he had stumbled on the
answer to his question

Miss Norris was hurried away because she knew about the secret passage

The passage then had something to do with the mystery of Roberts
death Miss Norris had used it in order to bring off her dramatic
appearance as the ghost Possibly she had discovered it for herself
possibly Mark had revealed it to her secretly one day never guessing
that she would make so unkind a use of it later on possibly Cayley
having been let into the joke of the dressingup had shown her how she
could make her appearance on the bowlinggreen even more mysterious and
supernatural One way or another she knew about the secret passage So
she must be hurried away

Why Because if she stayed and talked she might make some innocent
mention of it And Cayley did not want any mention of it

Why again Obviously because the passage or even the mere knowledge of
its existence might provide a clue

I wonder if Marks hiding there thought Antony and he went to sleep




CHAPTER X Mr Gillingham Talks Nonsense


Antony came down in a very good humour to breakfast next morning and
found that his host was before him Cayley looked up from his letters
and nodded

Any word of Mr Ablettof Mark said Antony as he poured out his
coffee

No The inspector wants to drag the lake this afternoon

Oh Is there a lake

There was just the flicker of a smile on Cayleys face but it
disappeared as quickly as it came

Well its really a pond he said but it was called the lake

By Mark thought Antony Aloud he said What do they expect to find

They think that Mark He broke off and shrugged his shoulders

May have drowned himself knowing that he couldnt get away And
knowing that he had compromised himself by trying to get away at all

Yes I suppose so said Cayley slowly

I should have thought he would have given himself more of a run for
his money After all he had a revolver If he was determined not to
be taken alive he could always have prevented that Couldnt he have
caught a train to London before the police knew anything about it

He might just have managed it There was a train They would have
noticed him at Waldheim of course but he might have managed it at
Stanton Hes not so wellknown there naturally The inspector has been
inquiring Nobody seems to have seen him

There are sure to be people who will say they did later on There was
never a missing man yet but a dozen people come forward who swear to
have seen him at a dozen different places at the same time

Cayley smiled

Yes Thats true Anyhow he wants to drag the pond first He added
dryly From what Ive read of detective stories inspectors always do
want to drag the pond first

Is it deep

Quite deep enough said Cayley as he got up On his way to the door he
stopped and looked at Antony Im so sorry that were keeping you here
like this but it will only be until tomorrow The inquest is tomorrow
afternoon Do amuse yourself how you like till then Beverley will look
after you

Thanks very much I shall really be quite all right

Antony went on with his breakfast Perhaps it was true that inspectors
liked dragging ponds but the question was did Cayleys like having them
dragged Was Cayley anxious about it or quite indifferent He certainly
did not seem to be anxious but he could hide his feelings very easily
beneath that heavy solid face and it was not often that the real
Cayley peeped out Just a little too eager once or twice perhaps but
there was nothing to be learnt from it this morning Perhaps he knew
that the pond had no secrets to give up After all inspectors were
always dragging ponds

Bill came in noisily

Bills face was an open book Excitement was written all over it

Well he said eagerly as he sat down to the business of the meal
what are we going to do this morning

Not talk so loudly for one thing said Antony Bill looked about
him apprehensively Was Cayley under the table for example After last
night one never knew

Is er He raised his eyebrows

No But one doesnt want to shout One should modulate the voice my
dear William while breathing gently from the hips Thus one avoids
those chestnotes which have betrayed many a secret In other words
pass the toast

You seem bright this morning

I am Very bright Cayley noticed it Cayley said Were it not that I
have other business I would come gathering nuts and may with thee Fain
would I gyrate round the mulberrybush and hop upon the little hills
But the waters of Jordan encompass me and Inspector Birch tarries
outside with his shrimpingnet My friend William Beverley will attend
thee anon Farewell a long farewell to allthy grapenuts He then
left upcentre Enter W Beverley R

Are you often like this at breakfast

Almost invariably Said he with his mouth full Exit W Beverley L

Its a touch of the sun I suppose said Bill shaking his head sadly

Its the sun and the moon and the stars all acting together on an
empty stomach Do you know anything about the stars Mr Beverley Do
you know anything about Orions Belt for instance And why isnt there
a star called Beverleys Belt Or a novel Said he masticating Reenter
W Beverley through trapdoor

Talking about trapdoors

Dont said Antony getting up Some talk of Alexander and some of
Hercules but nobody talks aboutwhats the Latin for trapdoorMensa
a table you might get it from that Well Mr Beverleyand he
slapped him heartily on the back as he went past himI shall see you
later Cayley says that you will amuse me but so far you have not made
me laugh once You must try and be more amusing when you have finished
your breakfast But dont hurry Let the upper mandibles have time to
do the work With those words Mr Gillingham then left the spacious
apartment

Bill continued his breakfast with a slightly bewildered air He did not
know that Cayley was smoking a cigarette outside the windows behind him
not listening perhaps possibly not even overhearing but within sight
of Antony who was not going to take any risks So he went on with his
breakfast reflecting that Antony was a rum fellow and wondering if
he had dreamed only of the amazing things which had happened the day
before

Antony went up to his bedroom to fetch his pipe It was occupied by
a housemaid and he made a polite apology for disturbing her Then he
remembered

Is it Elsie he asked giving her a friendly smile

Yes sir she said shy but proud She had no doubts as to why it was
that she had achieved such notoriety

It was you who heard Mr Mark yesterday wasnt it I hope the
inspector was nice to you

Yes thank you sir

Its my turn now You wait murmured Antony to himself

Yes sir Nastylike Meaning to say his chance had come

I wonder

Well thats what I heard sir Truly

Antony looked at her thoughtfully and nodded

Yes I wonder I wonder why

Why what sir

Oh lots of things Elsie It was quite an accident your being
outside just then

Elsie blushed She had not forgotten what Mrs Stevens had said about
it

Quite sir In the general way I use the other stairs

Of course

He had found his pipe and was about to go downstairs again when she
stopped him

I beg your pardon sir but will there be an inquest

Oh yes Tomorrow I think

Shall I have to give my evidence sir

Of course Theres nothing to be frightened of

I did hear it sir Truly

Why of course you did Who says you didnt

Some of the others sir Mrs Stevens and all

Oh thats just because theyre jealous said Antony with a smile

He was glad to have spoken to her because he had recognized at once
the immense importance of her evidence To the Inspector no doubt it
had seemed only of importance in that it had shown Mark to have adopted
something of a threatening attitude towards his brother To Antony it
had much more significance It was the only trustworthy evidence that
Mark had been in the office at all that afternoon

For who saw Mark go into the office Only Cayley And if Cayley had been
hiding the truth about the keys why should he not be hiding the truth
about Marks entry into the office Obviously all Cayleys evidence went
for nothing Some of it no doubt was true but he was giving it both
truth and falsehood with a purpose What the purpose was Antony did not
know as yet to shield Mark to shield himself even to betray
Markit might be any of these But since his evidence was given for his own
ends it was impossible that it could be treated as the evidence of
an impartial and trustworthy onlooker Such for instance as Elsie
appeared to be

Elsies evidence however seemed to settle the point Mark had gone
into the office to see his brother Elsie had heard them both talking
and then Antony and Cayley had found the body of Robert and the
Inspector was going to drag the pond

But certainly Elsies evidence did not prove anything more than the mere
presence of Mark in the room Its my turn now you wait That was not
an immediate threatit was a threat for the future If Mark had shot
his brother immediately afterwards it must have been an accident the
result of a struggle say provoked by that nastylike tone of voice
Nobody would say You wait to a man who was just going to be shot You
wait meant You wait and see whats going to happen to you later on
The owner of the Red House had had enough of his brothers sponging
his brothers blackmail now it was Marks turn to get a bit of his own
back Let Robert just wait a bit and he would see The conversation
which Elsie had overheard might have meant something like this It
couldnt have meant murder Anyway not murder of Robert by Mark

Its a funny business thought Antony The one obvious solution is so
easy and yet so wrong And Ive got a hundred things in my head and I
cant fit them together And this afternoon will make a hundred and one
I mustnt forget this afternoon

He found Bill in the hall and proposed a stroll Bill was only too
ready Where do you want to go he asked

I dont mind much Show me the park

Righto

They walked out together

Watson old man said Antony as soon as they were away from the
house you really mustnt talk so loudly indoors There was a gentleman
outside just behind you all the time

Oh I say said Bill going pink Im awfully sorry So thats why
you were talking such rot

Partly yes And partly because I do feel rather bright this morning
Were going to have a busy day

Are we really What are we going to do

Theyre going to drag the pondbeg its pardon the lake Where is the
lake

Were on the way to it now if youd like to see it

We may as well look at it Do you haunt the lake much in the ordinary
way

Oh no rather not Theres nothing to do there

You cant bathe

Well I shouldnt care to Too dirty

I see This is the way we came yesterday isnt it The way to the
village

Yes We go off a bit to the right directly What are they dragging it
for

Mark

Oh rot said Bill uneasily He was silent for a little and then
forgetting his uncomfortable thoughts in his sudden remembrance of the
exciting times they were having said eagerly I say when are we going
to look for that passage

We cant do very much while Cayleys in the house

What about this afternoon when theyre dragging the pond Hes sure to
be there

Antony shook his head

Theres something I must do this afternoon he said Of course we
might have time for both

Has Cayley got to be out of the house for the other thing too

Well I think he ought to be

I say is it anything rather exciting

I dont know It might be rather interesting I daresay I could do it
at some other time but I rather fancy it at three oclock somehow
Ive been specially keeping it back for then

I say what fun You do want me dont you

Of course I do Only Bill dont talk about things inside the house
unless I begin Theres a good Watson

I wont I swear I wont

They had come to the pondMarks lakeand they walked silently round
it When they had made the circle Antony sat down on the grass and
relit his pipe Bill followed his example

Well Mark isnt there said Antony

No said Bill At least I dont quite see why you know he isnt

It isnt knowing its guessing said Antony rapidly Its much
easier to shoot yourself than to drown yourself and if Mark had wanted
to shoot himself in the water with some idea of not letting the body be
found hed have put big stones in his pockets and the only big stones
are near the waters edge and they would have left marks and they
havent and therefore he didnt and oh bother the pond that can wait
till this afternoon Bill where does the secret passage begin

Well thats what weve got to find out isnt it

Yes You see my idea is this

He explained his reasons for thinking that the secret of the passage was
concerned in some way with the secret of Roberts death and went on

My theory is that Mark discovered the passage about a year agothe
time when he began to get keen on croquet The passage came out into
the floor of the shed and probably it was Cayleys idea to put a
croquetbox over the trapdoor so as to hide it more completely You
know when once youve discovered a secret yourself it always seems
as if it must be so obvious to everybody else I can imagine that Mark
loved having this little secret all to himself and to Cayley of course
but Cayley wouldnt count and they must have had great fun fixing it up
and making it more difficult for other people to find out Well then
when Miss Norris was going to dressup Cayley gave it away Probably
he told her that she could never get down to the bowlinggreen without
being discovered and then perhaps showed that he knew there was one way
in which she could do it and she wormed the secret out of him somehow

But this was two or three days before Robert turned up

Exactly I am not suggesting that there was anything sinister about the
passage in the first place It was just a little private bit of romance
and adventure for Mark three days ago He didnt even know that Robert
was coming But somehow the passage has been used since in connection
with Robert Perhaps Mark escaped that way perhaps hes hiding there
now And if so then the only person who could give him away was Miss
Norris And she of course would only do it innocently not knowing that
the passage had anything to do with it

So it was safer to have her out of the way

Yes

But look here Tony why do you want to bother about this end of it
We can always get in at the bowlinggreen end

I know but if we do that we shall have to do it openly It will mean
breaking open the box and letting Cayley know that weve done it You
see Bill if we dont find anything out for ourselves in the next day
or two weve got to tell the police what we have found out and then
they can explore the passage for themselves But I dont want to do that
yet

Rather not

So weve got to carry on secretly for a bit Its the only way He
smiled and added And its much more fun

Rather Bill chuckled to himself

Very well Where does the secret passage begin




CHAPTER XI The Reverend Theodore Ussher


Theres one thing which we have got to realize at once said Antony
and that is that if we dont find it easily we shant find it at all

You mean that we shant have time

Neither time nor opportunity Which is rather a consoling thought to a
lazy person like me

But it makes it much harder if we cant really look properly

Harder to find yes but so much easier to look For instance the
passage might begin in Cayleys bedroom Well now we know that it
doesnt

We dont know anything of the sort protested Bill

Weknow for the purposes of our search Obviously we cant go
tailing into Cayleys bedroom and tapping his wardrobes and obviously
therefore if we are going to look for it at all we must assume that it
doesnt begin there

Oh I see Bill chewed a piece of grass thoughtfully Anyhow it
wouldnt begin on an upstairs floor would it

Probably not Well were getting on

You can wash out the kitchen and all that part of the house said
Bill after more thought We cant go there

Right And the cellars if there are any

Well that doesnt leave us much

No Of course its only a hundredtoone chance that we find it but
what we want to consider is which is the most likely place of the few
places in which we can look safely

All it amounts to said Bill is the livingrooms
downstairsdiningroom library hall billiardroom and the office
rooms

Yes thats all

Well the office is the most likely isnt it

Yes Except for one thing

Whats that

Well its on the wrong side of the house One would expect the passage
to start from the nearest place to which it is going Why make it longer
by going under the house first

Yes thats true Well then you think the diningroom or the
library

Yes And the library for choice I mean for our choice There are
always servants going into diningrooms We shouldnt have much of a
chance of exploring properly in there Besides theres another thing to
remember Mark has kept this a secret for a year Could he have kept
it a secret in the diningroom Could Miss Norris have got into the
diningroom and used the secret door just after dinner without being
seen It would have been much too risky

Bill got up eagerly

Come along he said lets try the library If Cayley comes in we
can always pretend were choosing a book

Antony got up slowly took his arm and walked back to the house with
him

The library was worth going into passages or no passages Antony could
never resist another persons bookshelves As soon as he went into the
room he found himself wandering round it to see what books the owner
read or more likely did not read but kept for the air which they
lent to the house Mark had prided himself on his library It was a
mixed collection of books Books which he had inherited both from his
father and from his patron books which he had bought because he was
interested in them or if not in them in the authors to whom he wished
to lend his patronage books which he had ordered in beautifully bound
editions partly because they looked well on his shelves lending a
noble colour to his rooms partly because no man of culture should ever
be without them old editions new editions expensive books cheap
books a library in which everybody whatever his taste could be sure
of finding something to suit him

And which is your particular fancy Bill said Antony looking from
one shelf to another Or are you always playing billiards

I have a look at Badminton sometimes said Bill Its over in that
corner there He waved a hand

Over here said Antony going to it

Yes He corrected himself suddenlyOh no its not Its over
there on the right now Mark had a grand rearrangement of his library
about a year ago It took him more than a week he told us Hes got
such a frightful lot hasnt he

Now thats very interesting said Antony and he sat down and filled
his pipe again

There was indeed a frightful lot of books The four walls of the
library were plastered with them from floor to ceiling save only where
the door and the two windows insisted on living their own life even
though an illiterate one To Bill it seemed the most hopeless room of
any in which to look for a secret opening

We shall have to take every blessed book down he said before we can
be certain that we havent missed it

Anyway said Antony if we take them down one at a time nobody
can suspect us of sinister designs After all what does one go into a
library for except to take books down

But theres such a frightful lot

Antonys pipe was now going satisfactorily and he got up and walked
leisurely to the end of the wall opposite the door

Well lets have a look he said and see if they are so very
frightful Hallo heres your Badminton You often read that you
say

If I read anything

Yes He looked down and up the shelf Sport and Travel chiefly I
like books of travel dont you

Theyre pretty dull as a rule

Well anyhow some people like them very much said Antony
reproachfully He moved on to the next row of shelves The Drama The
Restoration dramatists You can have most of them Still as you well
remark many people seem to love them Shaw Wilde RobertsonI like
reading plays Bill There are not many people who do but those who do
are usually very keen Let us pass on

I say we havent too much time said Bill restlessly

We havent Thats why we arent wasting any Poetry Who reads poetry
nowadays Bill when did you last read Paradise Lost

Never

I thought not And when did Miss Calladine last read The Excursion
aloud to you

As a matter of fact BettyMiss Calladinehappens to be jolly keen on
whats the beggars name

Never mind his name You have said quite enough We pass on

He moved on to the next shelf

Biography Oh lots of it I love biographies Are you a member of the
Johnson Club I bet Mark is Memories of Many CourtsIm sure Mrs
Calladine reads that Anyway biographies are just as interesting as
most novels so why linger We pass on He went to the next shelf and
then gave a sudden whistle Hallo hallo

Whats the matter said Bill rather peevishly

Stand back there Keep the crowd back Bill We are getting amongst it
Sermons as I live Sermons Was Marks father a clergyman or does Mark
take to them naturally

His father was a parson I believe Oh yes I know he was

Ah then these are Fathers books HalfHours with the InfiniteI
must order that from the library when I get back The Lost Sheep
Jones on the Trinity The Epistles of St Paul Explained Oh Bill
were amongst it The Narrow Way being Sermons by the Rev Theodore
UssherhalLO

What is the matter

William I am inspired Stand by He took down the Reverend Theodore
Usshers classic work looked at it with a happy smile for a moment and
then gave it to Bill

Here hold Ussher for a bit

Bill took the book obediently

No give it me back Just go out into the hall and see if you can hear
Cayley anywhere Say Hallo loudly if you do

Bill went out quickly listened and came back

Its all right

Good He took the book out of its shelf again Now then you can hold
Ussher Hold him in the left hand so With the right or dexter hand
grasp this shelf firmly so Now when I say Pull pull gradually Got
that

Bill nodded his face alight with excitement

Good Antony put his hand into the space left by the stout Ussher and
fingered the back of the shelf Pull he said

Bill pulled

Now just go on pulling like that I shall get it directly Not hard
you know but just keeping up the strain

His fingers went at it again busily

And then suddenly the whole row of shelves from top to bottom swung
gently open towards them

Good Lord said Bill letting go of the shelf in his amazement

Antony pushed the shelves back extracted Ussher from Bills fingers
replaced him and then taking Bill by the arm led him to the sofa and
deposited him in it Standing in front of him he bowed gravely

Childs play Watson he said childs play

How on earth

Antony laughed happily and sat down on the sofa beside him

You dont really want it explained he said smacking him on the knee
youre just being Watsonish Its very nice of you of course and I
appreciate it

No but really Tony

Oh my dear Bill He smoked silently for a little and then went on
Its what I was saying just nowa secret is a secret until you have
discovered it and as soon as you have discovered it you wonder why
everybody else isnt discovering it and how it could ever have been a
secret at all This passage has been here for years with an opening at
one end into the library and at the other end into the shed Then Mark
discovered it and immediately he felt that everybody else must discover
it So he made the shed end more difficult by putting the croquetbox
there and this end more difficult by he stopped and looked at the
other by what Bill

But Bill was being Watsonish

What

Obviously by rearranging his books He happened to take out The Life
of Nelson or Three Men in a Boat or whatever it was and by the
merest chance discovered the secret Naturally he felt that everybody
else would be taking down The Life of Nelson or Three Men in a
Boat Naturally he felt that the secret would be safer if nobody ever
interfered with that shelf at all When you said that the books had been
rearranged a year agojust about the time the croquetbox came into
existenceof course I guessed why So I looked about for the dullest
books I could find the books nobody ever read Obviously the collection
of sermonbooks of a midVictorian clergyman was the shelf we wanted

Yes I see But why were you so certain of the particular place

Well he had to mark the particular place by some book I thought
that the joke of putting The Narrow Way just over the entrance to the
passage might appeal to him Apparently it did

Bill nodded to himself thoughtfully several times Yes thats very
neat he said Youre a clever devil Tony

Tony laughed

You encourage me to think so which is bad for me but very
delightful

Well come on then said Bill and he got up and held out a hand

Come on where

To explore the passage of course

Antony shook his head

Why ever not

Well what do you expect to find there

I dont know But you seemed to think that we might find something that
would help

Suppose we find Mark said Antony quietly

I say do you really think hes there

Suppose he is

Well then there we are

Antony walked over to the fireplace knocked out the ashes of his pipe
and turned back to Bill He looked at him gravely without speaking

What are you going to say to him he said at last

How do you mean

Are you going to arrest him or help him to escape

IIwell of course I began Bill stammering and then ended
lamely Well I dont know

Exactly Weve got to make up our minds havent we

Bill didnt answer Very much disturbed in his mind he walked
restlessly about the room frowning to himself stopping now and then
at the newly discovered door and looking at it as if he were trying to
learn what lay behind it Which side was he on if it came to choosing
sidesMarks or the Laws

You know you cant just say Oh er hallo to him said Antony
breaking rather appropriately into his thoughts

Bill looked up at him with a start

Nor went on Antony can you say This is my friend Mr Gillingham
who is staying with you We were just going to have a game of bowls

Yes its dashed difficult I dont know what to say Ive been rather
forgetting about Mark He wandered over to the window and looked out on
to the lawns There was a gardener clipping the grass edges No reason
why the lawn should be untidy just because the master of the house had
disappeared It was going to be a hot day again Dash it of course he
had forgotten Mark How could he think of him as an escaped murderer
a fugitive from justice when everything was going on just as it did
yesterday and the sun was shining just as it did when they all drove
off to their golf only twentyfour hours ago How could he help feeling
that this was not real tragedy but merely a jolly kind of detective
game that he and Antony were playing

He turned back to his friend

All the same he said you wanted to find the passage and now youve
found it Arent you going into it at all

Antony took his arm

Lets go outside again he said We cant go into it now anyhow
Its too risky with Cayley about Bill I feel like youjust a little
bit frightened But what Im frightened of I dont quite know Anyway
you want to go on with it dont you

Yes said Bill firmly We must

Then well explore the passage this afternoon if we get the chance
And if we dont get the chance then well try it tonight

They walked across the hall and out into the sunlight again

Do you really think we might find Mark hiding there asked Bill

Its possible said Antony Either Mark or He pulled himself up
quickly No he murmured to himself I wont let myself think
thatnot yet anyway Its too horrible




CHAPTER XII A Shadow on the Wall


In the twenty hours or so at his disposal Inspector Birch had been busy
He had telegraphed to London a complete description of Mark in the brown
flannel suit which he had last been seen wearing he had made inquiries
at Stanton as to whether anybody answering to this description had
been seen leaving by the 420 and though the evidence which had been
volunteered to him had been inconclusive it made it possible that
Mark had indeed caught that train and had arrived in London before the
police at the other end had been ready to receive him But the fact that
it was marketday at Stanton and that the little town would be more
full than usual of visitors made it less likely that either the
departure of Mark by the 420 or the arrival of Robert by the 210
earlier in the afternoon would have been particularly noticed As
Antony had said to Cayley there would always be somebody ready to hand
the police a circumstantial story of the movements of any man in whom
the police were interested

That Robert had come by the 210 seemed fairly certain To find out more
about him in time for the inquest would be difficult All that was known
about him in the village where he and Mark had lived as boys bore out
the evidence of Cayley He was an unsatisfactory son and he had been
hurried off to Australia nor had he been seen since in the village
Whether there were any more substantial grounds of quarrel between the
two brothers than that the younger one was at home and welltodo
while the elder was poor and an exile was not known nor as far as the
inspector could see was it likely to be known until Mark was captured

The discovery of Mark was all that mattered immediately Dragging
the pond might not help towards this but it would certainly give the
impression in court tomorrow that Inspector Birch was handling the case
with zeal And if only the revolver with which the deed was done was
brought to the surface his trouble would be well repaid Inspector
Birch produces the weapon would make an excellent headline in the local
paper

He was feeling wellsatisfied with himself therefore as he walked to
the pond where his men were waiting for him and quite in the mood for
a little pleasant talk with Mr Gillingham and his friend Mr Beverley
He gave them a cheerful Good afternoon and added with a smile
Coming to help us

You dont really want us said Antony smiling back at him

You can come if you like

Antony gave a little shudder

You can tell me afterwards what you find he said By the way he
added I hope the landlord at The George gave me a good character

The Inspector looked at him quickly

Now how on earth do you know anything about that

Antony bowed to him gravely

Because I guessed that you were a very efficient member of the Force

The inspector laughed

Well you came out all right Mr Gillingham You got a clean bill But
I had to make certain about you

Of course you did Well I wish you luck But I dont think youll
find much at the pond Its rather out of the way isnt it for anybody
running away

Thats just what I told Mr Cayley when he called my attention to the
pond However we shant do any harm by looking Its the unexpected
thats the most likely in this sort of case

Youre quite right Inspector Well we mustnt keep you Good
afternoon and Antony smiled pleasantly at him

Good afternoon sir

Good afternoon said Bill

Antony stood looking after the Inspector as he strode off silent for
so long that Bill shook him by the arm at last and asked him rather
crossly what was the matter

Antony shook his head slowly from side to side

I dont know really I dont know Its too devilish what I keep
thinking He cant be as coldblooded as that

Who

Without answering Antony led the way back to the gardenseat on which
they had been sitting He sat there with his head in his hands

Oh I hope they find something he murmured Oh I hope they do

In the pond

Yes

But what

Anything Bill anything

Bill was annoyed I say Tony this wont do You really mustnt be so
damn mysterious Whats happened to you suddenly

Antony looked up at him in surprise

Didnt you hear what he said

What particularly

That it was Cayleys idea to drag the pond

Oh Oh I say Bill was rather excited again You mean that hes
hidden something there Some false clue which he wants the police to
find

I hope so said Antony earnestly but Im afraid He stopped short

Afraid of what

Afraid that he hasnt hidden anything there Afraid that

Well

Whats the safest place in which to hide anything very important

Somewhere where nobody will look

Theres a better place than that

What

Somewhere where everybody has already looked

By Jove You mean that as soon as the pond has been dragged Cayley
will hide something there

Yes Im afraid so

But why afraid

Because I think that it must be something very important something
which couldnt easily be hidden anywhere else

What asked Bill eagerly

Antony shook his head

No Im not going to talk about it yet We can wait and see what the
Inspector finds He may find somethingI dont know whatsomething
that Cayley has put there for him to find But if he doesnt then it
will be because Cayley is going to hide something there tonight

What asked Bill again

You will see what Bill said Antony because we shall be there

Are we going to watch him

Yes if the Inspector finds nothing

Thats good said Bill

If it were a question of Cayley or the Law he was quite decided as to
which side he was taking Previous to the tragedy of yesterday he had
got on well enough with both of the cousins without being in the least
intimate with either Indeed of the two he preferred perhaps the
silent solid Cayley to the more volatile Mark Cayleys qualities as
they appeared to Bill may have been chiefly negative but even if this
merit lay in the fact that he never exposed whatever weaknesses he may
have had this is an excellent quality in a fellowguest or if you
like fellowhost in a house where one is continually visiting Marks
weaknesses on the other hand were very plain to the eye and Bill had
seen a good deal of them

Yet though he had hesitated to define his position that morning in
regard to Mark he did not hesitate to place himself on the side of the
Law against Cayley Mark after all had done him no harm but Cayley
had committed an unforgivable offence Cayley had listened secretly to
a private conversation between himself and Tony Let Cayley hang if the
Law demanded it

Antony looked at his watch and stood up

Come along he said Its time for that job I spoke about

The passage said Bill eagerly

No the thing which I said that I had to do this afternoon

Oh of course What is it

Without saying anything Antony led the way indoors to the office

It was three oclock and at three oclock yesterday Antony and Cayley
had found the body At a few minutes after three he had been looking
out of the window of the adjoining room and had been surprised suddenly
to find the door open and Cayley behind him He had vaguely wondered at
the time why he had expected the door to be shut but he had had no time
then to worry the thing out and he had promised himself to look into
it at his leisure afterwards Possibly it meant nothing possibly if
it meant anything he could have found out its meaning by a visit to
the office that morning But he had felt that he would be more likely
to recapture the impressions of yesterday if he chose as far as possible
the same conditions for his experiment So he had decided that three
oclock that afternoon should find him once more in the office

As he went into the room followed by Bill he felt it almost as a shock
that there was now no body of Robert lying there between the two doors
But there was a dark stain which showed where the dead mans head had
been and Antony knelt down over it as he had knelt twentyfour hours
before

I want to go through it again he said You must be Cayley Cayley
said he would get some water I remember thinking that water wasnt
much good to a dead man and that probably he was only too glad to
do anything rather than nothing He came back with a wet sponge and
a handkerchief I suppose he got the handkerchief from the chest of
drawers Wait a bit

He got up and went into the adjoining room looked round it pulled open
a drawer or two and after shutting all the doors came back to the
office

The sponge is there and there are handkerchiefs in the top righthand
drawer Now then Bill just pretend youre Cayley Youve just said
something about water and you get up

Feeling that it was all a little uncanny Bill who had been kneeling
beside his friend got up and walked out Antony as he had done on the
previous day looked up after him as he went Bill turned into the room
on the right opened the drawer and got the handkerchief damped the
sponge and came back

Well he said wonderingly

Antony shook his head

Its all different he said For one thing you made a devil of a
noise and Cayley didnt

Perhaps you werent listening when Cayley went in

I wasnt But I should have heard him if I could have heard him and I
should have remembered afterwards

Perhaps Cayley shut the door after him

Wait

He pressed his hand over his eyes and thought It wasnt anything which
he had heard but something which he had seen He tried desperately hard
to see it again He saw Cayley getting up opening the door from the
office leaving it open and walking into the passage turning to the
door on the right opening it going in and thenWhat did his eyes see
after that If they would only tell him again

Suddenly he jumped up his face alight Bill Ive got it he cried

What

The shadow on the wall I was looking at the shadow on the wall Oh
ass and ten times ass

Bill looked uncomprehendingly at him Antony took his arm and pointed to
the wall of the passage

Look at the sunlight on it he said Thats because youve left the
door of that room open The sun comes straight in through the windows
Now Im going to shut the door Look Dyou see how the shadow moves
across Thats what I sawthe shadow moving across as the door shut
behind him Bill go in and shut the door behind youquite naturally
Quick

Bill went out and Antony knelt watching eagerly

I thought so he cried I knew it couldnt have been that

What happened said Bill coming back

Just what you would expect The sunlight came and the shadow moved
back againall in one movement

And what happened yesterday

The sunlight stayed there and then the shadow came very slowly back
and there was no noise of the door being shut

Bill looked at him with startled eyes

By Jove You mean that Cayley closed the door afterwardsas an
afterthoughtand very quietly so that you couldnt hear

Antony nodded

Yes That explains why I was surprised afterwards when I went into
the room to find the door open behind me You know how those doors with
springs on them close

The sort which old gentlemen have to keep out draughts

Yes Just at first they hardly move at all and then very very
slowly they swing to well that was the way the shadow moved and
subconsciously I must have associated it with the movement of that sort
of door By Jove He got up and dusted his knees Now Bill just to
make sure go in and close the door like that As an afterthought you
know and very quietly so that I dont hear the click of it

Bill did as he was told and then put his head out eagerly to hear what
had happened

That was it said Antony with absolute conviction That was just
what I saw yesterday He came out of the office and joined Bill in the
little room

And now he said lets try and find out what it was that Mr Cayley
was doing in here and why he had to be so very careful that his friend
Mr Gillingham didnt overhear him




CHAPTER XIII The Open Window


Anthonys first thought was that Cayley had hidden something something
perhaps which he had found by the body but that was absurd In the
time at his disposal he could have done no more than put it away in a
drawer where it would be much more open to discovery by Antony than if
he had kept it in his pocket In any case he would have removed it by
this time and hidden it in some more secret place Besides why in this
case bother about shutting the door

Bill pulled open a drawer in the chest and looked inside

Is it any good going through these do you think he asked

Antony looked over his shoulder

Why did he keep clothes here at all he asked Did he ever change
down here

My dear Tony he had more clothes than anybody in the world He just
kept them here in case they might be useful I expect When you and I
go from London to the country we carry our clothes about with us Mark
never did In his flat in London he had everything all over again which
he has here It was a hobby with him collecting clothes If hed
had half a dozen houses they would all have been full of a complete
gentlemans town and country outfit

I see

Of course it might be useful sometimes when he was busy in the
next room not to have to go upstairs for a handkerchief or a more
comfortable coat

I see Yes He was walking round the room as he answered and he
lifted the top of the linen basket which stood near the wash basin and
glanced in He seems to have come in here for a collar lately

Bill peered in There was one collar at the bottom of the basket

Yes I daresay he would he agreed If he suddenly found that the one
he was wearing was uncomfortable or a little bit dirty or something He
was very finicking

Antony leant over and picked it out

It must have been uncomfortable this time he said after examining it
carefully It couldnt very well be cleaner He dropped it back again
Anyway he did come in here sometimes

Oh yes rather

Yes but what did Cayley come in for so secretly

What did he want to shut the door for said Bill Thats what I dont
understand You couldnt have seen him anyhow

No So it follows that I might have heard him He was going to do
something which he didnt want me to hear

By Jove thats it said Bill eagerly

Yes but what

Bill frowned hopefully to himself but no inspiration came

Well lets have some air anyway he said at last exhausted by the
effort and he went to the window opened it and looked out Then
struck by an idea he turned back to Antony and said Do you think
I had better go up to the pond to make sure that theyre still at it
Because

He broke off suddenly at the sight of Antonys face

Oh idiot idiot Antony cried Oh most superexcellent of Watsons
Oh you lamb you blessing Oh Gillingham you incomparable ass

What on earth

The window the window cried Antony pointing to it

Bill turned back to the window expecting it to say something As it
said nothing he looked at Antony again

He was opening the window cried Antony

Who

Cayley of course Very gravely and slowly he expounded He came in
here in order to open the window He shut the door so that I shouldnt
hear him open the window He opened the window I came in here and found
the window open I said This window is open My amazing powers of
analysis tell me that the murderer must have escaped by this window
Oh said Cayley raising his eyebrows Well said he I suppose you
must be right Said I proudly I am For the window is open I said
Oh you incomparable ass

He understood now It explained so much that had been puzzling him

He tried to put himself in Cayleys placeCayley when Antony had first
discovered him hammering at the door and crying Let me in Whatever
had happened inside the office whoever had killed Robert Cayley knew
all about it and knew that Mark was not inside and had not escaped by
the window But it was necessary to Cayleys plansto Marks plans
if they were acting in concertthat he should be thought so to have
escaped At some time then while he was hammering the key in his
pocket at the locked door he must suddenly have rememberedwith what
a shockthat a mistake had been made A window had not been left open

Probably it would just have been a horrible doubt at first Was the
office window open Surely it was open Was it Would he have time
now to unlock the door slip in open the French windows and slip out
again No At any moment the servants might come It was too risky
Fatal if he were discovered But servants were stupid He could get
the windows safely open while they were crowding round the body They
wouldnt notice He could do it somehow

And then Antonys sudden appearance Here was a complication And Antony
suggesting that they should try the window Why the window was just
what he wanted to avoid No wonder he had seemed dazed at first

Ah and here at last was the explanation why they had gone the longest
way round and yet run It was Cayleys only chance of getting a start
on Antony of getting to the windows first of working them open somehow
before Antony caught him up Even if that were impossible he must get
there first just to make sure Perhaps they were open He must get away
from Antony and see And if they were shut hopelessly shut then he
must have a moment to himself a moment in which to think of some other
plan and avoid the ruin which seemed so suddenly to be threatening

So he had run But Antony had kept up with him They had broken in the
window together and gone into the office But Cayley was not done yet
There was the dressingroom window But quietly quietly Antony mustnt
hear

And Antony didnt hear Indeed he had played up to Cayley splendidly
Not only had he called attention to the open window but he had
carefully explained to Cayley why Mark had chosen this particular window
in preference to the office window And Cayley had agreed that probably
that was the reason How he must have chuckled to himself But he was
still a little afraid Afraid that Antony would examine the shrubbery
Why Obviously because there was no trace of anyone having broken
through the shrubbery No doubt Cayley had provided the necessary traces
since and had helped the Inspector to find them Had he even gone as
far as footmarks in Marks shoes But the ground was very hard Perhaps
footmarks were not necessary Antony smiled as he thought of the big
Cayley trying to squeeze into the dapper little Marks shoes Cayley
must have been glad that footmarks were not necessary

No the open window was enough the open window and a broken twig or
two But quietly quietly Antony mustnt hear And Antony had not
heard But he had seen a shadow on the wall

They were outside on the lawn again now Bill and Antony and Bill was
listening openmouthed to his friends theory of yesterdays happenings
It fitted in it explained things but it did not get them any further
It only gave them another mystery to solve

Whats that said Antony

Mark Wheres Mark If he never went into the office at all then where
is he now

I dont say that he never went into the office In fact he must have
gone Elsie heard him He stopped and repeated slowly She heard him
at least she says she did But if he was there he came out again by the
door

Well but where does that lead you

Where it led Mark The passage

Do you mean that hes been hiding there all the time Antony was
silent until Bill had repeated his question and then with an effort he
came out of his thoughts and answered him

I dont know But look here Here is a possible explanation I dont
know if it is the right oneI dont know Bill Im rather frightened
Frightened of what may have happened of what may be going to happen
However here is an explanation See if you can find any fault with it

With his legs stretched out and his hands deep in his pockets he lay
back on the gardenseat looking up to the blue summer sky above him
and just as if he saw up there the events of yesterday being enacted
over again he described them slowly to Bill as they happened

Well begin at the moment when Mark shoots Robert Call it an accident
probably it was Mark would say it was anyhow He is in a panic
naturally But he doesnt lock the door and run away For one thing the
key is on the outside of the door for another he is not quite such a
fool as that But he is in a horrible position He is known to be on bad
terms with his brother he has just uttered some foolish threat to him
which may possibly have been overheard What is he to do He does
the natural thing the thing which Mark would always do in such
circumstances He consults Cayley the invaluable inevitable Cayley

Cayley is just outside Cayley must have heard the shot Cayley will
tell him what to do He opens the door just as Cayley is coming to see
what is the matter He explains rapidly Whats to be done Cay
Whats to be done It was an accident I swear it was an accident He
threatened me He would have shot me if I hadnt Think of something
quick

Cayley has thought of something Leave it to me he says You clear
out altogether I shot him if you like Ill do all the explaining Get
away Hide Nobody saw you go in Into the passage quick Ill come to
you there as soon as I can

Good Cayley Faithful Cayley Marks courage comes back Cayley
will explain all right Cayley will tell the servants that it was an
accident He will ring up the police Nobody will suspect CayleyCayley
has no quarrel with Robert And then Cayley will come into the passage
and tell him that it is all right and Mark will go out by the other
end and saunter slowly back to the house He will be told the news by
one of the servants Robert accidentally shot Good Heavens

So greatly reassured Mark goes into the library And Cayley goes to
the door of the office and locks it And then he bangs on the door
and shouts Let me in

Antony was silent Bill looked at him and shook his head

Yes Tony but that doesnt make sense Whats the point of Cayley
behaving like that

Antony shrugged his shoulders without answering

And what has happened to Mark since

Antony shrugged his shoulders again

Well the sooner we go into that passage the better said Bill

Youre ready to go

Quite said Bill surprised

Youre quite ready for what we may find

Youre being dashed mysterious old boy

I know I am He gave a little laugh and went on Perhaps Im being
an ass just a melodramatic ass Well I hope I am He looked at his
watch

Its safe is it Theyre still busy at the pond

Wed better make certain Could you be a sleuthhound Billone of
those that travel on their stomachs very noiselessly I mean could you
get near enough to the pond to make sure that Cayley is still there
without letting him see you

Rather He got up eagerly You wait

Antonys head shot up suddenly Why that was what Mark said he
cried

Mark

Yes What Elsie heard him say

Oh that

Yes I suppose she couldnt have made a mistake Bill She did hear
him

She couldnt have mistaken his voice if thats what you mean

Oh

Mark had an extraordinary characteristic voice

Oh

Rather highpitched you know and well one cant explain but

Yes

Well rather like this you know or even more so if anything He
rattled these words off in Marks rather monotonous highpitched voice
and then laughed and added in his natural voice I say that was
really rather good

Antony nodded quickly That was like it he said

Exactly

Yes He got up and squeezed Bills arm Well just go and see about
Cayley and then well get moving I shall be in the library

Right

Bill nodded and walked off in the direction of the pond This was
glorious fun this was life The immediate programme could hardly be
bettered First of all he was going to stalk Cayley There was a little
copse above the level of the pond and about a hundred yards away from
it He would come into this from the back creep cautiously through
it taking care that no twigs cracked and then drawing himself on his
stomach to the edge peer down upon the scene below him People were
always doing that sort of thing in books and he had been filled with a
hopeless envy of them well now he was actually going to do it himself
What fun

And then when he had got back unobserved to the house and reported to
Antony they were going to explore the secret passage Again what fun
Unfortunately there seemed to be no chance of buried treasure but there
might be buried clues Even if you found nothing you couldnt get away
from the fact that a secret passage was a secret passage and anything
might happen in it But even that wasnt the end of this exciting day
They were going to watch the pond that night they were going to watch
Cayley under the moonlight watch him as he threw into the silence of
the pond what The revolver Well anyhow they were going to watch him
What fun

To Antony who was older and who realized into what deep waters they
were getting it did not seem fun But it was amazingly interesting
He saw so much and yet somehow it was all out of focus It was like
looking at an opal and discovering with every movement of it some new
colour some new gleam of light reflected and yet never really seeing
the opal as a whole He was too near it or too far away he strained
his eyes and he relaxed his eyes it was no good His brain could not
get hold of it

But there were moments when he almost had it and then turned away
from it He had seen more of life than Bill but he had never seen
murder before and this which was in his mind now and to which he was
afraid to listen was not just the hotblooded killing which any man
may come to if he lose control It was something much more horrible Too
horrible to be true Then let him look again for the truth He looked
again but it was all out of focus

I will not look again he said aloud as he began to walk towards
the house Not yet anyway He would go on collecting facts and
impressions Perhaps the one fact would come along by itself which
would make everything clear




CHAPTER XIV Mr Beverley Qualifies for the Stage


Bill had come back and had reported rather breathless that Cayley was
still at the pond

But I dont think theyre getting up much except mud he said I ran
most of the way back so as to give us as much time as possible

Antony nodded

Well come along then he said The sooner the quicker

They stood in front of the row of sermons Antony took down the Reverend
Theodore Usshers famous volume and felt for the spring Bill pulled
The shelves swung open towards them

By Jove said Bill it is a narrow way

There was an opening about a yard square in front of them which had
something the look of a brick fireplace a fireplace raised about two
feet from the ground But save for one row of bricks in front the
floor of it was emptiness Antony took a torch from his pocket and
flashed it down into the blackness

Look he whispered to the eager Bill The steps begin down there Six
feet down

He flashed his torch up again There was a handhold of iron a sort of
large iron staple in the bricks in front of them

You swing off from there said Bill At least I suppose you do I
wonder how Ruth Norris liked doing it

Cayley helped her I should think Its funny

Shall I go first asked Bill obviously longing to do so Antony shook
his head with a smile

I think I will if you dont mind very much Bill Just in case

In case of what

Well in case

Bill had to be content with that but he was too much excited to wonder
what Antony meant

Righto he said Go on

Well well just make sure we can get back again first It really
wouldnt be fair on the Inspector if we got stuck down here for the rest
of our lives Hes got enough to do trying to find Mark but if he has
to find you and me as well

We can always get out at the other end

Well were not certain yet I think Id better just go down and back
I promise faithfully not to explore

Right you are

Antony sat down on the ledge of bricks swung his feet over and sat
there for a moment his legs dangling He flashed his torch into the
darkness again so as to make sure where the steps began then returned
it to his pocket seized the staple in front of him and swung himself
down His feet touched the steps beneath him and he let go

Is it all right said Bill anxiously

All right Ill just go down to the bottom of the steps and back Stay
there

The light shone down by his feet His head began to disappear For
a little while Bill craning down the opening could still see faint
splashes of light and could hear slow uncertain footsteps for a little
longer he could fancy that he saw and heard them then he was alone

Well not quite alone There was a sudden voice in the hall outside

Good Lord said Bill turning round with a start Cayley

If he was not so quick in thought as Antony he was quick enough in
action Thought was not demanded now To close the secret door safely
but noiselessly to make sure that the books were in the right places
to move away to another row of shelves so as to be discovered deep in
Badminton or Baedeker or whomever the kind gods should send to his
aid the difficulty was not to decide what to do but to do all this in
five seconds rather than in six

Ah there you are said Cayley from the doorway

Hallo said Bill in surprise looking up from the fourth volume of
The Life and Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge Have they finished

Finished what

The pond said Bill wondering why he was reading Coleridge on such
a fine afternoon Desperately he tried to think of a good reason
verifying a quotationan argument with Antonythat would do But what
quotation

Oh no Theyre still at it Wheres Gillingham

The Ancient Marinerwater water everywhereor was that something
else And where was Gillingham Water water everywhere

Tony Oh hes about somewhere Were just going down to the village
They arent finding anything at the pond are they

No But they like doing it Something off their minds when they can say
theyve done it

Bill deep in his book looked up and said Yes and went back to it
again He was just getting to the place

Whats the book said Cayley coming up to him Out of the corner of
his eye he glanced at the shelf of sermons as he came Bill saw that
glance and wondered Was there anything there to give away the secret

I was just looking up a quotation he drawled Tony and I had a
bet about it You know that thing abouter water water everywhere
andernot a drop to drink But what on earth he wondered to
himself were they betting about

Nor any drop to drink to be accurate

Bill looked at him in surprise Then a happy smile came on his face

Quite sure he said

Of course

Then youve saved me a lot of trouble Thats what the bet was about
He closed the book with a slam put it back in its shelf and began
to feel for his pipe and tobacco I was a fool to bet with Tony he
added He always knows that sort of thing

So far so good But here was Cayley still in the library and there was
Antony all unsuspecting in the passage When Antony came back he would
not be surprised to find the door closed because the whole object of
his going had been to see if he could open it easily from the inside At
any moment then the bookshelf might swing back and show Antonys head
in the gap A nice surprise for Cayley

Come with us he said casually as he struck a match He pulled
vigorously at the flame as he waited for the answer hoping to hide his
anxiety for if Cayley assented he was done

Ive got to go into Stanton

Bill blew out a great cloud of smoke with an expiration which covered
also a heartfelt sigh of relief

Oh a pity Youre driving I suppose

Yes The car will be here directly Theres a letter I must write
first He sat down at a writing table and took out a sheet of
notepaper

He was facing the secret door if it opened he would see it At any
moment now it might open

Bill dropped into a chair and thought Antony must be warned Obviously
But how How did one signal to anybody By code Morse code Did Antony
know it Did Bill know it himself if it came to that He had picked up
a bit in the Armynot enough to send a message of course But a
message was impossible anyhow Cayley would hear him tapping it out It
wouldnt do to send more than a single letter What letters did he know
And what letter would convey anything to Antony He pulled at
his pipe his eyes wandering from Cayley at his desk to the Reverend
Theodore Ussher in his shelf What letter

C for Cayley Would Antony understand Probably not but it was
just worth trying What was C Long short long short
Umptyiddyumptyiddy Was that right C yes that was C He was sure of
that C Umptyiddyumptyiddy

Hands in pockets he got up and wandered across the room humming
vaguely to himself the picture of a man waiting for another man as it
might be his friend Gillingham to come in and take him away for a walk
or something He wandered across to the books at the back of Cayley and
began to tap absentmindedly on the shelves as he looked at the titles
Umptyiddyumptyiddy Not that it was much like that at first he
couldnt get the rhythm of it Umptyiddyumptyiddy That was
better He was back at Samuel Taylor Coleridge now Antony would begin
to hear him soon Umptyiddyumptyiddy just the aimless tapping of a
man who is wondering what book he will take out with him to read on
the lawn Would Antony hear One always heard the man in the next flat
knocking out his pipe Would Antony understand Umptyiddyumptyiddy
C for Cayley Antony Cayleys here For Gods sake wait

Good Lord Sermons said Bill with a loud laugh
Umptyiddyumptyiddy Ever read em Cayley

What Cayley looked up suddenly Bills back moved slowly along his
fingers beating a tattoo on the shelves as he walked

Er no said Cayley with a little laugh An awkward uncomfortable
little laugh it seemed to Bill

Nor do I He was past the sermons now past the secret door but still
tapping in the same aimless way

Oh for Gods sake sit down burst out Cayley Or go outside if you
want to walk about

Bill turned round in astonishment

Hallo whats the matter

Cayley was slightly ashamed of his outburst

Sorry Bill he apologized My nerves are on edge Your constant
tapping and fidgeting about

Tapping said Bill with an air of complete surprise

Tapping on the shelves and humming Sorry It got on my nerves

My dear old chap Im awfully sorry Ill go out in the hall

Its all right said Cayley and went on with his letter Bill sat
down in his chair again Had Antony understood Well anyhow there was
nothing to do now but wait for Cayley to go And if you ask me said
Bill to himself much pleased I ought to be on the stage Thats where
I ought to be The complete actor

A minute two minutes three minutes five minutes It was safe now
Antony had guessed

Is the car there asked Cayley as he sealed up his letter

Bill strolled into the hall called back Yes and went out to talk to
the chauffeur Cayley joined him and they stood there for a moment

Hallo said a pleasant voice behind them They turned round and saw
Antony

Sorry to keep you waiting Bill

With a tremendous effort Bill restrained his feelings and said casually
enough that it was all right

Well I must be off said Cayley Youre going down to the village

Thats the idea

I wonder if youd take this letter to Jallands for me

Of course

Thanks very much Well I shall see you later

He nodded and got into the car

As soon as they were alone Bill turned eagerly to his friend

Well he said excitedly

Come into the library

They went in and Tony sank down into a chair

You must give me a moment he panted Ive been running

Running

Well of course How do you think I got back here

You dont mean you went out at the other end

Antony nodded

I say did you hear me tapping

I did indeed Bill youre a genius

Bill blushed

I knew youd understand he said You guessed that I meant Cayley

I did It was the least I could do after you had been so brilliant You
must have had rather an exciting time

Exciting Good Lord I should think it was

Tell me about it

As modestly as possible Mr Beverley explained his qualifications for a
life on the stage

Good man said Antony at the end of it You are the most perfect
Watson that ever lived Bill my lad he went on dramatically rising
and taking Bills hand in both of his There is nothing that you and I
could not accomplish together if we gave our minds to it

Silly old ass

Thats what you always say when Im being serious Well anyway thanks
awfully You really saved us this time

Were you coming back

Yes At least I think I was I was just wondering when I heard you
tapping The fact of the door being shut was rather surprising Of
course the whole idea was to see if it could be opened easily from the
other side but I felt somehow that you wouldnt shut it until the last
possible momentuntil you saw me coming back Well then I heard the
taps and I knew it must mean something so I sat tight Then when C
began to come along I said Cayley bJovebright arent Iand I
simply hared to the other end of the passage for all I was worth And
hared back again Because I thought you might be getting rather involved
in explanationsabout where I was and so on

You didnt see Mark then

No Nor hisNo I didnt see anything

Nor what

Antony was silent for a moment

I didnt see anything Bill Or rather I did see something I saw a
door in the wall a cupboard And its locked So if theres anything we
want to find thats where it is

Could Mark be hiding there

I called through the keyhole in a whisper Mark are you there he
would have thought it was Cayley There was no answer

Well lets go down and try again We might be able to get the door
open

Antony shook his head

Arent I going at all said Bill in great disappointment

When Antony spoke it was to ask another question

Can Cayley drive a car

Yes of course Why

Then he might easily drop the chauffeur at his lodge and go off to
Stanton or wherever he wanted to on his own

I suppose so if he wanted to

Yes Antony got up Well look here as we said we were going into
the village and as we promised to leave that letter I almost think
wed better do it

Oh Oh very well

Jallands What were you telling me about that Oh yes the Widow
Norbury

Thats right Cayley used to be rather keen on the daughter The
letters for her

Yes well lets take it Just to be on the safe side

Am I going to be done out of that secret passage altogether asked
Bill fretfully

Theres nothing to see really I promise you

Youre very mysterious Whats upset you You did see something down
there Im certain of it

I did and Ive told you about it

No you havent You only told me about the door in the wall

Thats it Bill And its locked And Im frightened of whats behind
it

But then we shall never know whats there if we arent going to look

We shall know tonight said Antony taking Bills arm and leading him
to the hall when we watch our dear friend Cayley dropping it into the
pond




CHAPTER XV Mrs Norbury Confides in Dear Mr Gillingham


They left the road and took the path across the fields which sloped
gently downwards towards Jallands Antony was silent and since it is
difficult to keep up a conversation with a silent man for any length
of time Bill had dropped into silence too Or rather he hummed
to himself hit at thistles in the grass with his stick and made
uncomfortable noises with his pipe But he noticed that his companion
kept looking back over his shoulder almost as if he wanted to remember
for a future occasion the way by which they were coming Yet there was
no difficulty about it for they remained all the time in view of the
road and the belt of trees above the long park wall which bordered its
further side stood out clearly against the sky

Antony who had just looked round again turned back with a smile

Whats the joke said Bill glad of the more social atmosphere

Cayley Didnt you see

See what

The car Going past on the road there

So thats what you were looking for Youve got jolly good eyes my
boy if you recognize the car at this distance after only seeing it
twice

Well I have got jolly good eyes

I thought he was going to Stanton

He hoped youd think so obviously

Then where is he going

The library probably To consult our friend Ussher After making
quite sure that his friends Beverley and Gillingham really were going to
Jallands as they said

Bill stopped suddenly in the middle of the path

I say do you think so

Antony shrugged his shoulders

I shouldnt be surprised We must be devilishly inconvenient for him
hanging about the house Any moment he can get when were definitely
somewhere else must be very useful to him

Useful for what

Well useful for his nerves if for nothing else We know hes mixed
up in this business we know hes hiding a secret or two Even if he
doesnt suspect that were on his tracks he must feel that at any
moment we might stumble on something

Bill gave a grunt of assent and they went slowly on again

What about tonight he said after a lengthy blow at his pipe

Try a piece of grass said Antony offering it to him Bill pushed it
through the mouthpiece blew again said Thats better and returned
the pipe to his pocket

How are we going to get out without Cayley knowing

Well that wants thinking over Its going to be difficult I wish we
were sleeping at the inn Is this Miss Norbury by any chance

Bill looked up quickly They were close to Jallands now an old thatched
farmhouse which after centuries of sleep had woken up to a new world
and had forthwith sprouted wings wings however of so discreet
a growth that they had not brought with them any obvious change of
character and Jallands even with a bathroom was still Jallands To the
outward view at any rate Inside it was more clearly Mrs Norburys

YesAngela Norbury murmured Bill Not badlooking is she

The girl who stood by the little white gate of Jallands was something
more than not badlooking but in this matter Bill was keeping
his superlatives for another In Bills eyes she must be judged and
condemned by all that distinguished her from Betty Calladine To
Antony unhampered by these standards of comparison she seemed quite
simply beautiful

Cayley asked us to bring a letter along explained Bill when the
necessary handshakings and introductions were over Here you are

You will tell him wont you how dreadfully sorry I am about what
has happened It seems so hopeless to say anything so hopeless even to
believe it If it is true what weve heard

Bill repeated the outline of events of yesterday

Yes And Mr Ablett hasnt been found yet She shook her head in
distress It still seems to have happened to somebody else somebody we
didnt know at all Then with a sudden grave smile which included both
of them But you must come and have some tea

Its awfully decent of you said Bill awkwardly but weer

You will wont you she said to Antony

Thank you very much

Mrs Norbury was delighted to see them as she always was to see any man
in her house who came up to the necessary standard of eligibility When
her lifework was completed and summed up in those beautiful words A
marriage has been arranged and will shortly take place between Angela
daughter of the late John Norbury then she would utter a grateful
Nunc dimittis and depart in peace to a better world if Heaven insisted
but preferably to her new soninlaws more dignified establishment
For there was no doubt that eligibility meant not only eligibility as a
husband

But it was not as eligibles that the visitors from the Red House were
received with such eagerness today and even if her special smile for
possibles was there it was instinctive rather than reasoned All that
she wanted at this moment was newsnews of Mark For she was bringing
it off at last and if the engagement columns of the Morning Post
were preceded as in the case of its obituary columns by a premonitory
bulletin the announcement of yesterday would have cried triumphantly
to the world or to such part of the world as mattered A marriage has
very nearly been arranged by Mrs Norbury and will certainly take
place between Angela only daughter of the late John Norbury andMark
Ablett of the Red House And coming across it on his way to the
sporting page Bill would have been surprised For he had thought that
if anybody it was Cayley

To the girl it was neither She was often amused by her mothers ways
sometimes ashamed of them sometimes distressed by them The Mark Ablett
affair had seemed to her particularly distressing for Mark was so
obviously in league with her mother against her Other suitors upon
whom her mother had smiled had been embarrassed by that championship
Mark appeared to depend on it as much as on his own attractions great
though he thought these to be They went awooing together It was a
pleasure to turn to Cayley that hopeless ineligible

But alas Cayley had misunderstood her She could not imagine Cayley in
love until she saw it and tried too late to stop it That was four
days ago She had not seen him since and now here was this letter She
dreaded opening it It was a relief to feel that at least she had an
excuse for not doing so while her guests were in the house

Mrs Norbury recognized at once that Antony was likely to be the more
sympathetic listener and when tea was over and Bill and Angela had
been dispatched to the garden with the promptness and efficiency of
the expert dear Mr Gillingham found himself on the sofa beside her
listening to many things which were of even greater interest to him than
she could possibly have hoped

It is terrible terrible she said And to suggest that dear Mr
Ablett

Antony made suitable noises

Youve seen Mr Ablett for yourself A kinder more warmhearted man

Antony explained that he had not seen Mr Ablett

Of course yes I was forgetting But believe me Mr Gillingham you
can trust a womans intuition in these matters

Antony said that he was sure of this

Think of my feelings as a mother

Antony was thinking of Miss Norburys feelings as a daughter and
wondering if she guessed that her affairs were now being discussed with
a stranger Yet what could he do What indeed did he want to do except
listen in the hope of learning Mark engaged or about to be engaged
Had that any bearing on the events of yesterday What for instance
would Mrs Norbury have thought of brother Robert that family skeleton
Was this another reason for wanting brother Robert out of the way

I never liked him never

Never liked said Antony bewildered

That cousin of his Mr Cayley

Oh

I ask you Mr Gillingham am I the sort of woman to trust my little
girl to a man who would go about shooting his only brother

Im sure you wouldnt Mrs Norbury

If there has been any shooting done it has been done by somebody
else

Antony looked at her inquiringly

I never liked him said Mrs Norbury firmly Never However thought
Antony to himself that didnt quite prove that Cayley was a murderer

How did Miss Norbury get on with him he asked cautiously

There was nothing in that at all said Miss Norburys mother
emphatically Nothing I would say so to anybody

Oh I beg your pardon I never meant

Nothing I can say that for dear Angela with perfect confidence
Whether he made advances She broke off with a shrug of her plump
shoulders

Antony waited eagerly

Naturally they met Possibly he might haveI dont know But my duty
as a mother was clear Mr Gillingham

Mr Gillingham made an encouraging noise

I told him quite frankly thathow shall I put itthat he was
trespassing Tactfully of course But frankly

You mean said Antony trying to speak calmly that you told him
thaterMr Ablett and your daughter

Mrs Norbury nodded several times

Exactly Mr Gillingham I had my duty as a mother

I am sure Mrs Norbury that nothing would keep you from doing your
duty But it must have been disagreeable Particularly if you werent
quite sure

He was attracted Mr Gillingham Obviously attracted

Who would not be said Antony with a charming smile It must have
been something of a shock to him to

It was just that which made me so glad that I had spoken I saw at once
that I had not spoken a moment too soon

There must have been a certain awkwardness about the next meeting
suggested Antony

Naturally he has not been here since No doubt they would have been
bound to meet up at the Red House sooner or later

Ohthis was only quite lately

Last week Mr Gillingham I spoke just in time

Ah said Antony under his breath He had been waiting for it

He would have liked now to have gone away so that he might have thought
over the new situation by himself or perhaps preferably to have
changed partners for a little while with Bill Miss Norbury would hardly
be ready to confide in a stranger with the readiness of a mother but he
might have learnt something by listening to her For which of them had
she the greater feeling Cayley or Mark Was she really prepared to
marry Mark Did she love him or the otheror neither Mrs Norbury was
only a trustworthy witness in regard to her own actions and thoughts
he had learnt all that was necessary of those and only the daughter now
had anything left to tell him But Mrs Norbury was still talking

Girls are so foolish Mr Gillingham she was saying It is fortunate
that they have mothers to guide them It was so obvious to me from the
beginning that dear Mr Ablett was just the husband for my little girl
You never knew him

Antony said again that he had not seen Mr Ablett

Such a gentleman So nicelooking in his artistic way A regular
VelasquezI should say Van Dyck Angela would have it that she could
never marry a man with a beard As if that mattered when She broke
off and Antony finished her sentence for her

The Red House is certainly charming he said

Charming Quite charming And it is not as if Mr Abletts appearance
were in any way undistinguished Quite the contrary Im sure you agree
with me

Antony said that he had never had the pleasure of seeing Mr Ablett

Yes And quite the centre of the literary and artistic world So
desirable in every way

She gave a deep sigh and communed with herself for a little Antony
was about to snatch the opportunity of leaving when Mrs Norbury began
again

And then theres this scapegrace brother of his He was perfectly frank
with me Mr Gillingham He would be He told me of this brother and
I told him that I was quite certain it would make no difference to
my daughters feelings for him After all the brother was in
Australia

When was this Yesterday Antony felt that if Mark had only mentioned
it after his brothers announcement of a personal call at the Red House
this perfect frankness had a good deal of wisdom behind it

It couldnt have been yesterday Mr Gillingham Yesterday she
shuddered and shook her head

I thought perhaps he had been down here in the morning

Oh no There is such a thing Mr Gillingham as being too devoted a
lover Not in the morning no We both agreed that dear AngelaOh
no No the day before yesterday when he happened to drop in about
teatime

It occurred to Antony that Mrs Norbury had come a long way from her
opening statement that Mark and Miss Norbury were practically engaged
She was now admitting that dear Angela was not to be rushed that dear
Angela had indeed no heart for the match at all

The day before yesterday As it happened dear Angela was out Not that
it mattered He was driving to Middleston He hardly had time for a cup
of tea so that even if she had been in

Antony nodded absently This was something new Why did Mark go to
Middleston the day before yesterday But after all why shouldnt he
A hundred reasons unconnected with the death of Robert might have taken
him there

He got up to go He wanted to be alonealone at least with Bill
Mrs Norbury had given him many things to think over but the great
outstanding fact which had emerged was this that Cayley had reason to
hate MarkMrs Norbury had given him that reason To hate Well to be
jealous anyhow But that was enough

You see he said to Bill as they walked back we know that Cayley is
perjuring himself and risking himself over this business and that must
be for one of two reasons Either to save Mark or to endanger him
That is to say he is either wholeheartedly for him or wholeheartedly
against him Well now we know that he is against him definitely
against him

But I say you know protested Bill one doesnt necessarily try to
ruin ones rival in love

Doesnt one said Antony turning to him with a smile

Bill blushed

Well of course one never knows but I mean

You mightnt try to ruin him Bill but you wouldnt perjure yourself
in order to get him out of a trouble of his own making

Lord no

So that of the two alternatives the other is the more likely

They had come to the gate into the last field which divided them from
the road and having gone through it they turned round and leant
against it resting for a moment and looking down at the house which
they had left

Jolly little place isnt it said Bill

Very But rather mysterious

In what way

Well wheres the front door

The front door Why youve just come out of it

But isnt there a drive or a road or anything

Bill laughed

No thats the beauty of it to some people And thats why its so
cheap and why the Norburys can afford it I expect Theyre not too
well off

But what about luggage and tradesmen and that kind of thing

Oh theres a carttrack but motorcars cant come any nearer than the
road he turned round and pointed up there So the weekend millionaire
people dont take it At least theyd have to build a road and a garage
and all the rest of it if they did

I see said Antony carelessly and they turned round and continued
their walk up to the road But later on he remembered this casual
conversation at the gate and saw the importance of it




CHAPTER XVI Getting Ready for the Night


What was it which Cayley was going to hide in that pond that night
Antony thought that he knew now It was Marks body

From the beginning he had seen this answer coming and had drawn back
from it For if Mark had been killed it seemed such a coldblooded
killing Was Cayley equal to it Bill would have said No but that was
because he had had breakfast with Cayley and lunch with him and dinner
with him had ragged him and played games with him Bill would have said
No because Bill wouldnt have killed anybody in cold blood himself
and because he took it for granted that other people behaved pretty much
as he did But Antony had no such illusions Murders were done murder
had actually been done here for there was Roberts dead body Why not
another murder

Had Mark been in the office at all that afternoon The only evidence
other than Cayleys which obviously did not count was Elsies Elsie
was quite certain that she had heard his voice But then Bill had said
that it was a very characteristic voicean easy voice therefore to
imitate If Bill could imitate it so successfully why not Cayley

But perhaps it had not been such a coldblooded killing after all
Suppose Cayley had had a quarrel with his cousin that afternoon over the
girl whom they were both wooing Suppose Cayley had killed Mark either
purposely in sudden passion or accidentally meaning only to knock
him down Suppose that this had happened in the passage say about
two oclock either because Cayley had deliberately led him there or
because Mark had casually suggested a visit to it One could imagine
Mark continually gloating over that secret passage Suppose Cayley
there with the body at his feet feeling already the rope round his
neck his mind darting this way and that in frantic search for a way
of escape and suppose that suddenly and irrelevantly he remembers
that Robert is coming to the house at three oclock that
afternoonautomatically he looks at his watchin half an hours
time In half an hours time He must think of something quickly
quickly Shall he bury the body in the passage and let it be thought
that Mark ran away frightened at the mere thought of his brothers
arrival But there was the evidence of the breakfast table Mark had
seemed annoyed at this resurrection of the black sheep but certainly
not frightened No that was much too thin a story But suppose Mark had
actually seen his brother and had a quarrel with him suppose it could
be made to look as if Robert had killed Mark

Antony pictured to himself Cayley in the passage standing over the dead
body of his cousin and working it out How could Robert be made to seem
the murderer if Robert were alive to deny it But suppose Robert were
dead too

He looks at his watch again Only twentyfive minutes now Suppose
Robert were dead too Robert dead in the office and Mark dead in the
passage how does that help Madness But if the bodies were brought
together somehow and Roberts death looked like suicide Was it
possible

Madness again Too difficult Only twenty minutes now Too difficult
to arrange in twenty minutes Cant arrange a suicide Too difficult
Only nineteen minutes

And then the sudden inspiration Robert dead in the office Marks body
hidden in the passageimpossible to make Robert seem the murderer but
how easy to make Mark Robert dead and Mark missing why it jumped to
the eye at once Mark had killed Robertaccidentally yes that would
be more likelyand then had run away Sudden panic He looks at his
watch again Fifteen minutes but plenty of time now The thing arranges
itself

Was that the solution Antony wondered It seemed to fit in with the
facts as they knew them but then so did that other theory which he had
suggested to Bill in the morning

Which one said Bill

They had come back from Jallands through the park and were sitting in
the copse above the pond from which the Inspector and his fishermen had
now withdrawn Bill had listened with open mouth to Antonys theory and
save for an occasional By Jove had listened in silence Smart man
Cayley had been his only comment at the end

Which other theory

That Mark had killed Robert accidentally and had gone to Cayley for
help and that Cayley having hidden him in the passage locked the
office door from the outside and hammered on it

Yes but you were so dashed mysterious about that I asked you what
the point of it was and you wouldnt say anything He thought for a
little and then went on I suppose you meant that Cayley deliberately
betrayed Mark and tried to make him look like a murderer

I wanted to warn you that we should probably find Mark in the passage
alive or dead

And now you dont think so

Now I think that his dead body is there

Meaning that Cayley went down and killed him afterwardsafter you had
come after the police had come

Well thats what I shrink from Bill Its so horribly coldblooded
Cayley may be capable of it but I hate to think of it

But dash it all your other way is coldblooded enough According to
you he goes up to the office and deliberately shoots a man with whom he
has no quarrel whom he hasnt seen for fifteen years

Yes but to save his own neck That makes a difference My theory is
that he quarrelled violently with Mark over the girl and killed him in
sudden passion Anything that happened after that would be selfdefense
I dont mean that I excuse it but that I understand it And I think
that Marks dead body is in the passage now and has been there since
say halfpast two yesterday afternoon And tonight Cayley is going to
hide it in the pond

Bill pulled at the moss on the ground beside him threw away a handful
or two and said slowly You may be right but its all guesswork you
know

Antony laughed

Good Lord of course it is he said And tonight we shall know if
its a good guess or a bad one

Bill brightened up suddenly

Tonight he said I say tonights going to be rather fun How do
we work it

Antony was silent for a little

Of course he said at last we ought to inform the police so that
they can come here and watch the pond tonight

Of course grinned Bill

But I think that perhaps it is a little early to put our theories
before them

I think perhaps it is said Bill solemnly

Antony looked up at him with a sudden smile

Bill you old bounder

Well dash it its our show I dont see why we shouldnt get our
little bit of fun out of it

Neither do I All right then well do without the police tonight

We shall miss them said Bill sadly but tis better so

There were two problems in front of them first the problem of getting
out of the house without being discovered by Cayley and secondly the
problem of recovering whatever it was which Cayley dropped into the pond
that night

Lets look at it from Cayleys point of view said Antony He may not
know that were on his track but he cant help being suspicious of
us Hes bound to be suspicious of everybody in the house and more
particularly of us because were presumably more intelligent than the
others

He stopped for a moment to light his pipe and Bill took the opportunity
of looking more intelligent than Mrs Stevens

Now he has got something to hide tonight and hes going to take good
care that we arent watching him Well what will he do

See that we are asleep first before he starts out

Yes Come and tuck us up and see that were nice and comfortable

Yes thats awkward said Bill But we could lock our doors and then
he wouldnt know that we werent there

Have you ever locked your door

Never

No And you can bet that Cayley knows that Anyway hed bang on it
and you wouldnt answer and then what would he think

Bill was silent crushed

Then I dont see how were going to do it he said after deep
thought Hell obviously come to us just before he starts out and that
doesnt give us time to get to the pond in front of him

Lets put ourselves in his place said Antony puffing slowly at his
pipe Hes got the body or whatever it is in the passage He wont
come up the stairs carrying it in his arms and look in at our doors to
see if were awake Hell have to make sure about us first and then go
down for the body afterwards So that gives us a little time

Yyes said Bill doubtfully We might just do it but itll be a bit
of a rush

But wait When hes gone down to the passage and got the body what
will he do next

Come out again said Bill helpfully

Yes but which end

Bill sat up with a start

By Jove you mean that he will go out at the far end by the
bowlinggreen

Dont you think so Just imagine him walking across the lawn in full
view of the house at midnight with a body in his arms Think of
the awful feeling he would have in the back of the neck wondering if
anybody any restless sleeper had chosen just that moment to wander
to the window and look out into the night Theres still plenty of
moonlight Bill Is he going to walk across the park in the moonlight
with all those windows staring at him Not if he can help it But he
can get out by the bowling green and then come to the pond without ever
being in sight of the house at all

Youre right And that will just about give us time Good Now whats
the next thing

The next thing is to mark the exact place in the pond where he drops
whatever he drops

So that we can fish it out again

If we can see what it is we shant want to The police can have a
go at it tomorrow But if its something we cant identify from a
distance then we must try and get it out To see whether its worth
telling the police about

Yyes said Bill wrinkling his forehead Of course the trouble with
water is that one bit of it looks pretty much like the next bit I dont
know if that had occurred to you

It had smiled Antony Lets come and have a look at it

They walked to the edge of the copse and lay down there in silence
looking at the pond beneath them

See anything said Antony at last

What

The fence on the other side

What about it

Well its rather useful thats all

Said Sherlock Holmes enigmatically added Bill A moment later his
friend Watson had hurled him into the pond

Antony laughed

I love being Sherlocky he said Its very unfair of you not to play
up to me

Why is that fence useful my dear Holmes said Bill obediently

Because you can take a bearing on it You see

Yes you neednt stop to explain to me what a bearing is

I wasnt going to But youre lying herehe looked upunderneath
this pinetree Cayley comes out in the old boat and drops his parcel
in You take a line from here on to the boat and mark it off on the
fence there Say its the fifth post from the end Well then I take a
line from my treewell find one for me directlyand it comes on to
the twentieth post say And where the two lines meet there shall
the eagles be gathered together QED And there I almost forgot to
remark will the taller eagle Beverley by name do his famous diving
act As performed nightly at the Hippodrome

Bill looked at him uneasily

I say really Its beastly dirty water you know

Im afraid so Bill So it is written in the book of Jasher

Of course I knew that one of us would have to but I hoped well its
a warm night

Just the night for a bathe agreed Antony getting up Well now
lets have a look for my tree

They walked down to the margin of the pond and then looked back Bills
tree stood up and took the evening tall and unmistakable fifty feet
nearer to heaven than its neighbours But it had its fellow at the other
end of the copse not quite so tall perhaps but equally conspicuous

Thats where I shall be said Antony pointing to it Now for the
Lords sake count your posts accurately

Thanks very much but I shall do it for my own sake said Bill with
feeling I dont want to spend the whole night diving

Fix on the post in a straight line with you and the splash and then
count backwards to the beginning of the fence

Right old boy Leave it to me I can do this on my head

Well thats how you will have to do the last part of it said Antony
with a smile

He looked at his watch It was nearly time to change for dinner They
started to walk back to the house together

Theres one thing which worries me rather said Antony Where does
Cayley sleep

Next door to me Why

Well its just possible that he might have another look at you after
hes come back from the pond I dont think hed bother about it in the
ordinary way but if he is actually passing your door I think he might
glance in

I shant be there I shall be at the bottom of the pond sucking up
mud

Yes Do you think you could leave something in your bed that looked
vaguely like you in the dark A bolster with a pyjamacoat round it and
one arm outside the blanket and a pair of socks or something for the
head You know the kind of thing I think it would please him to feel
that you were still sleeping peacefully

Bill chuckled to himself

Rather Im awfully good at that Ill make him up something really
good But what about you

Im at the other end of the house hes hardly likely to bother about
me a second time And I shall be so very fast asleep at his first visit
Still I may as well to be on the safe side

They went into the house Cayley was in the hall as they came in He
nodded and took out his watch

Time to change he said

Just about said Bill

You didnt forget my letter

I did not In fact we had tea there

Ah He looked away and said carelessly How were they all

They sent all sorts of sympathetic messages to you andand all that
sort of thing

Oh yes

Bill waited for him to say something more and then as nothing
was coming he turned round said Come on Tony and led the way
upstairs

Got all you want he said at the top of the stairs

I think so Come and see me before you go down

Righto

Antony shut his bedroom door behind him and walked over to the window
He pushed open a casement and looked out His bedroom was just over
the door at the back of the house The side wall of the office which
projected out into the lawn beyond the rest of the house was on his
left He could step out on to the top of the door and from there drop
easily to the ground Getting back would be little more difficult There
was a convenient waterpipe which would help

He had just finished his dressing when Bill came in Final
instructions he asked sitting down on the bed By the way how are
we amusing ourselves after dinner I mean immediately after dinner

Billiards

Righto Anything you like

Dont talk too loud said Antony in a lower voice Were more or less
over the hall and Cayley may be there He led the way to the window
Well go out this way tonight Going downstairs is too risky Its
easy enough better put on tennisshoes

Right I say in case I dont get another chance alone with you what do
I do when Cayley comes to tuck me up

Its difficult to say Be as natural as you can I mean if he just
knocks lightly and looks in be asleep Dont overdo the snoring But
if he makes a hell of a noise youll have to wake up and rub your eyes
and wonder what on earth hes doing in your room at all You know the
sort of thing

Right And about the dummy figure Ill make it up directly we come
upstairs and hide it under the bed

Yes I think wed better go completely to bed ourselves We shant
take a moment dressing again and it will give him time to get safely
into the passage Then come into my room

Right Are you ready

Yes

They went downstairs together





CHAPTER XVII Mr Beverley Takes the Water


Cayley seemed very fond of them that night After dinner was over he
suggested a stroll outside They walked up and down the gravel in front
of the house saying very little to each other until Bill could
stand it no longer For the last twenty turns he had been slowing down
hopefully each time they came to the door but the hint had always been
lost on his companions and each time another turn had been taken But
in the end he had been firm

What about a little billiards he said shaking himself free from the
others

Will you play said Antony to Cayley

Ill watch you he said and he had watched them resolutely until the
game and then another game after that had been played

They went into the hall and attacked the drinks

Well thank heaven for bed said Bill putting down his glass Are
you coming

Yes said Antony and finished his drink He looked at Cayley

Ive just got one or two little things to do said Cayley I shant
be long following you

Well good night then

Good night

Good night called Bill from halfway up the stairs Good night
Tony

Good night

Bill looked at his watch Halfpast eleven Not much chance of anything
happening for another hour He pulled open a drawer and wondered what
to wear on their expedition Grey flannel trousers flannel shirt and
a dark coat perhaps a sweater as they might be lying out in the copse
for some time And good idea a towel He would want it later on and
meanwhile he could wear it round his waist

Tennisshoes There Everything was ready Now then for the dummy
figure

He looked at his watch again before getting into bed Twelvefifteen
How long to wait before Cayley came up He turned out the light and
then standing by the door in his pyjamas waited for his eyes to become
accustomed to the new darkness He could only just make out the bed
in the corner of the room Cayley would want more light than that if
he were to satisfy himself from the door that the bed was occupied He
pulled the curtains a little way back That was about right He could
have another look later on when he had the dummy figure in the bed

How long would it be before Cayley came up It wasnt that he wanted his
friends Beverley and Gillingham to be asleep before he started on his
business at the pond all that he wanted was to be sure that they were
safely in their bedrooms Cayleys business would make no noise give
no sign to attract the most wakeful member of the household so long as
the household was really inside the house But if he wished to reassure
himself about his guests he would have to wait until they were far
enough on their way to sleep not to be disturbed by him as he came up
to reassure himself So it amounted to the same thing really He would
wait until they were asleep until they were asleep asleep

With a great effort Bill regained the mastery over his wandering
thoughts and came awake again This would never do It would be fatal if
he went to sleep if he went to sleep to sleep  And then in
an instant he was intensely awake Suppose Cayley never came at all

Suppose Cayley was so unsuspicious that as soon as they had gone
upstairs he had dived down into the passage and set about his business
Suppose even now he was at the pond dropping into it that secret of
his Good heavens what fools they had been How could Antony have taken
such a risk Put yourself in Cayleys place he had said But how was
it possible They werent Cayley Cayley was at the pond now They would
never know what he had dropped into it

Listen Somebody at the door He was asleep Quite naturally now
Breathe a little more loudly perhaps He was asleep The door was
opening He could feel it opening behind him Good Lord suppose
Cayley really was a murderer Why even now he might beno he mustnt
think of that If he thought of that he would have to turn round
He mustnt turn round He was asleep just peacefully asleep But why
didnt the door shut Where was Cayley now Just behind him And in his
hand no he mustnt think of that He was asleep But why didnt the
door shut

The door was shutting There was a sigh from the sleeper in the bed
a sigh of relief which escaped him involuntarily But it had a very
natural sounda deep breath from a heavy sleeper He added another one
to it to make it seem more natural The door was shut

Bill counted a hundred slowly and then got up As quickly and as
noiselessly as possible he dressed himself in the dark He put the dummy
figure in the bed arranged the clothes so that just enough but not
too much of it was showing and stood by the door looking at it For a
casual glance the room was just about light enough Then very quietly
very slowly he opened the door All was still There was no light from
beneath the door of Cayleys room Very quietly very carefully he crept
along the passage to Antonys room He opened the door and went in

Antony was still in bed Bill walked across to wake him up and then
stopped rigid and his heart thumped against his ribs There was
somebody else in the room

All right Bill said a whispering voice and Antony stepped out from
the curtains

Bill gazed at him without saying anything

Rather good isnt it said Antony coming closer and pointing to the
bed Come on the sooner we get out now the better

He led the way out of the window the silent Bill following him They
reached the ground safely and noiselessly went quickly across the lawn
and so over the fence into the park It was not until they were out of
sight of the house that Bill felt it safe to speak

I quite thought it was you in bed he said

I hoped you would I shall be rather disappointed now if Cayley doesnt
call again Its a pity to waste it

He came all right just now

Oh rather What about you

Bill explained his feelings picturesquely

There wouldnt have been much point in his killing you said Antony
prosaically Besides being too risky

Oh said Bill And then I had rather hoped that it was his love for
me which restrained him

Antony laughed

I doubt it You didnt turn up your light when you dressed

Good Lord no Did you want me to

Antony laughed again and took him by the arm

Youre a splendid conspirator Bill You and I could take on anything
together

The pond was waiting for them more solemn in the moonlight The trees
which crowned the sloping bank on the far side of it were mysteriously
silent It seemed that they had the world very much to themselves

Almost unconsciously Antony spoke in a whisper

Theres your tree theres mine As long as you dont move theres no
chance of his seeing you After hes gone dont come out till I do He
wont be here for a quarter of an hour or so so dont be impatient

Righto whispered Bill

Antony gave him a nod and a smile and they walked off to their posts

The minutes went by slowly To Antony lying hidden in the undergrowth
at the foot of his tree a new problem was presenting itself Suppose
Cayley had to make more than one journey that night He might come back
to find them in the boat one of them indeed in the water And if they
decided to wait in hiding on the chance of Cayley coming back again
what was the least time they could safely allow Perhaps it would be
better to go round to the front of the house and watch for his return
there the light in his bedroom before conducting their experiments at
the pond But then they might miss his second visit in this way if he
made a second visit It was difficult

His eyes were fixed on the boat as he considered these things and
suddenly as if materialized from nowhere Cayley was standing by the
boat In his hand was a small brown bag

Cayley put the bag in the bottom of the boat stepped in and using an
oar as a puntpole pushed slowly off Then very silently he rowed
towards the middle of the pond

He had stopped The oars rested on the water He picked up the bag from
between his feet leant over the nose of the boat and rested it lightly
on the water for a moment Then he let go It sank slowly He waited
there watching afraid perhaps that it might rise again Antony began
to count

And now Cayley was back at his startingplace He tied up the boat
looked carefully round to see that he had left no traces behind him
and then turned to the water again For a long time as it seemed to the
watchers he stood there very big very silent in the moonlight At
last he seemed satisfied Whatever his secret was he had hidden it and
so with a gentle sigh as unmistakable to Antony as if he had heard it
Cayley turned away and vanished again as quietly as he had come

Antony gave him three minutes and stepped out from the trees He waited
there for Bill to join him

Six whispered Bill

Antony nodded

Im going round to the front of the house You get back to your tree
and watch in case Cayley comes again Your bedroom is the lefthand end
one and Cayleys the end but one Is that right

Bill nodded

Right Wait in hiding till I come back I dont know how long I shall
be but dont be impatient It will seem longer than it is He patted
Bill on the shoulder and with a smile and a nod of the head he left him
there

What was in the bag What could Cayley want to hide other than a key or
a revolver Keys and revolvers sink of themselves no need to put them
in a bag first What was in the bag Something which wouldnt sink of
itself something which needed to be helped with stones before it would
hide itself safely in the mud

Well they would find that out There was no object in worrying about
it now Bill had a dirty nights work in front of him But where was the
body which Antony had expected so confidently or if there were no body
where was Mark

More immediately however where was Cayley As quickly as he could
Antony had got to the front of the house and was now lying in the
shrubbery which bordered the lawn waiting for the light to go up
in Cayleys window If it went up in Bills window then they were
discovered It would mean that Cayley had glanced into Bills room had
been suspicious of the dummy figure in the bed and had turned up the
light to make sure After that it was war between them But if it went
up in Cayleys room

There was a light Antony felt a sudden thrill of excitement It was in
Bills room War

The light stayed there shining vividly for a wind had come up blowing
the moon behind a cloud and casting a shadow over the rest of the
house Bill had left his curtains undrawn It was careless of him the
first stupid thing he had done but

The moon slipped out again and Antony laughed to himself in the
bushes There was another window beyond Cayleys and there was no light
in it The declaration of war was postponed

Antony lay there watching Cayley into bed After all it was only polite
to return Cayleys own solicitude earlier in the night Politeness
demanded that one should not disport oneself on the pond until ones
friends were comfortably tucked up

Meanwhile Bill was getting tired of waiting His chief fear was that he
might spoil everything by forgetting the number six It was the sixth
post Six He broke off a twig and divided it into six pieces These
he arranged on the ground in front of him Six He looked at the pond
counted up to the sixth post and murmured six to himself again Then
he looked down at his twigs Onetwothreefourfivesixseven Seven
Was it seven Or was that seventh bit of a twig an accidental bit which
had been on the ground anyhow Surely it was six Had he said six
to Antony If so Antony would remember and it was all right Six
He threw away the seventh twig and collected the other six together
Perhaps they would be safer in his pocket Six The height of a tall
manwell his own height Six feet Yes that was the way to remember
it Feeling a little safer on the point he began to wonder about the
bag and what Antony would say to it and the possible depth of the
water and of the mud at the bottom and was still so wondering and
saying Good Lord what a life to himself when Antony reappeared

Bill got up and came down the slope to meet him

Six he said firmly Sixth post from the end

Good smiled Antony Mine was the eighteentha little way past it

What did you go off for

To see Cayley into bed

Is it all right

Yes Better hang your coat over the sixth post and then we shall
see it more easily Ill put mine on the eighteenth Are you going to
undress here or in the boat

Some here and some in the boat Youre quite sure that you wouldnt
like to do the diving yourself

Quite thanks

They had walked round to the other side of the pond Coming to the sixth
post of the fence Bill took off his coat and put it in position
and then finished his undressing while Antony went off to mark the
eighteenth post When they were ready they got into the boat Antony
taking the oars

Now Bill tell me as soon as Im in a line with your two marks

He rowed slowly towards the middle of the pond

Youre about there now said Bill at last

Antony stopped rowing and looked about him

Yes thats pretty well right He turned the boats nose round until
it was pointing to the pinetree under which Bill had lain You see my
tree and the other coat

Yes said Bill

Right Now then Im going to row gently along this line until were
dead in between the two Get it as exact as you canfor your own sake

Steady said Bill warningly Back a little a little more  a
little more forward again Right Antony left the oars on the water
and looked around As far as he could tell they were in an exact line
with each pair of landmarks

Now then Bill in you go

Bill pulled off his shirt and trousers and stood up

You mustnt dive from the boat old boy said Antony hastily Youll
shift its position Slide in gently

Bill slid in from the stern and swam slowly round to Antony

Whats it like said Antony

Cold Well heres luck to it

He gave a sudden kick flashed for a moment in the water and was gone
Antony steadied the boat and took another look at his landmarks

Bill came up behind him with a loud explosion Its pretty muddy he
protested

Weeds

No thank the Lord

Well try again

Bill gave another kick and disappeared Again Antony coaxed the boat
back into position and again Bill popped up this time in front of him

I feel that if I threw you a sardine said Antony with a smile
youd catch it in your mouth quite prettily

Its awfully easy to be funny from where you are How much longer have
I got to go on doing this

Antony looked at his watch

About three hours We must get back before daylight But be quicker if
you can because its rather cold for me sitting here

Bill flicked a handful of water at him and disappeared again He was
under for almost a minute this time and there was a grin on his face
when it was visible again

Ive got it but its devilish hard to get up Im not sure that it
isnt too heavy for me

Thats all right said Antony He brought out a ball of thick string
from his pocket Get this through the handle if you can and then we
can both pull

Good man He paddled to the side took one end of the string and
paddled back again Now then

Two minutes later the bag was safely in the boat Bill clambered in
after it and Antony rowed back Well done Watson he said quietly
as they landed He fetched their two coats and then waited the bag in
his hand while Bill dried and dressed himself As soon as the latter
was ready he took his arm and led him into the copse He put the bag
down and felt in his pockets

I shall light a pipe before I open it he said What about you

Yes

With great care they filled and lit their pipes Bills hand was a
little unsteady Antony noticed it and gave him a reassuring smile

Ready

Yes

They sat down and taking the bag between his knees Antony pressed the
catch and opened it

Clothes said Bill

Antony pulled out the top garment and shook it out It was a wet brown
flannel coat

Do you recognize it he asked

Marks brown flannel suit

The one he is advertised as having run away in

Yes It looks like it Of course he had a dashed lot of clothes

Antony put his hand in the breastpocket and took out some letters He
considered them doubtfully for a moment

I suppose Id better read them he said I mean just to see He
looked inquiringly at Bill who nodded Antony turned on his torch and
glanced at them Bill waited anxiously

Yes Mark Hallo

What is it

The letter that Cayley was telling the Inspector about From Robert
Mark your loving brother is coming to see you Yes I suppose I had
better keep this Well thats his coat Lets have out the rest of it
He took the remaining clothes from the bag and spread them out

Theyre all here said Bill Shirt tie socks underclothes
shoesyes all of them

All that he was wearing yesterday

Yes

What do you make of it

Bill shook his head and asked another question

Is it what you expected

Antony laughed suddenly

Its too absurd he said I expectedwell you know what I expected
A body A body in a suit of clothes Well perhaps it would be safer
to hide them separately The body here and the clothes in the passage
where they would never betray themselves And now he takes a great deal
of trouble to hide the clothes here and doesnt bother about the body
at all He shook his head Im a bit lost for the moment Bill and
thats the fact

Anything else there

Antony felt in the bag

Stones andyes theres something else He took it out and held it
up There we are Bill

It was the office key

By Jove you were right

Antony felt in the bag again and then turned it gently upside down on
the grass A dozen large stones fell outand something else He flashed
down his torch

Another key he said

He put the two keys in his pocket and sat there for a long time in
silence thinking Bill was silent too not liking to interrupt his
thoughts but at last he said

Shall I put these things back

Antony looked up with a start

What Oh yes No Ill put them back You give me a light will you

Very slowly and carefully he put the clothes back in the bag pausing as
he took up each garment in the certainty as it seemed to Bill that
it had something to tell him if only he could read it When the last of
them was inside he still waited there on his knees thinking

Thats the lot said Bill

Antony nodded at him

Yes thats the lot he said and thats the funny thing about it
Youre sure it is the lot

What do you mean

Give me the torch a moment He took it and flashed it over the ground
between them Yes thats the lot Its funny He stood up the bag in
his hands Now lets find a hidingplace for these and then He said
no more but stepped off through the trees Bill following him meekly

As soon as they had got the bag off their hands and were clear of the
copse Antony became more communicative He took the two keys out of his
pocket

One of them is the office key I suppose and the other is the key of
the passage cupboard So I thought that perhaps we might have a look at
the cupboard

I say do you really think it is

Well I dont see what else it can be

But why should he want to throw it away

Because it has now done its work whatever it was and he wants to wash
his hands of the passage Hed throw the passage away if he could I
dont think it matters much one way or another and I dont suppose
theres anything to find in the cupboard but I feel that we must look

Do you still think Marks body might be there

No And yet where else can it be Unless Im hopelessly wrong and
Cayley never killed him at all

Bill hesitated wondering if he dare advance his theory

I know youll think me an ass

My dear Bill Im such an obvious ass myself that I should be delighted
to think you are too

Well then suppose Mark did kill Robert and Cayley helped him to
escape just as we thought at first I know you proved afterwards that
it was impossible but suppose it happened in a way we dont know about
and for reasons we dont know about I mean there are such a lot of
funny things about the whole show thatwell almost anything might have
happened

Youre quite right Well

Well then this clothes business Doesnt that seem rather to bear out
the escaping theory Marks brown suit was known to the police Couldnt
Cayley have brought him another one in the passage to escape in and
then have had the brown one on his hands And thought it safest to hide
it in the pond

Yes said Anthony thoughtfully Then Go on

Bill went on eagerly

It all seems to fit in you know I mean even with your first
theorythat Mark killed him accidentally and then came to Cayley for
help Of course if Cayley had played fair hed have told Mark that he
had nothing to be afraid of But he isnt playing fair he wants to get
Mark out of the way because of the girl Well this is his chance He
makes Mark as frightened as possible and tells him that his only hope
is to run away Well naturally he does all he can to get him well
away because if Mark is caught the whole story of Cayleys treachery
comes out

Yes But isnt it overdoing it rather to make him change his
underclothes and everything It wastes a good deal of time you know

Bill was pulled up short and said Oh in great disappointment

No its not as bad as that Bill said Antony with a smile I
daresay the underclothes could be explained But heres the difficulty
Why did Mark need to change from brown to blue or whatever it was when
Cayley was the only person who saw him in brown

The police description of him says that he is in a brown suit

Yes because Cayley told the police You see even if Mark had had
lunch in his brown suit and the servants had noticed it Cayley could
always have pretended that he had changed into blue after lunch because
only Cayley saw him afterwards So if Cayley had told the Inspector that
he was wearing blue Mark could have escaped quite comfortably in his
brown without needing to change at all

But thats just what he did do cried Bill triumphantly What fools
we are

Antony looked at him in surprise and then shook his head

Yes yes insisted Bill Of course Dont you see Mark did change
after lunch and to give him more of a chance of getting away Cayley
lied and said that he was wearing the brown suit in which the servants
had seen him Well then he was afraid that the police might examine
Marks clothes and find the brown suit still there so he hid it and
then dropped it in the pond afterwards

He turned eagerly to his friend but Antony said nothing Bill began to
speak again and was promptly waved into silence

Dont say anything more old boy youve given me quite enough to think
about Dont lets bother about it tonight Well just have a look at
this cupboard and then get to bed

But the cupboard had not much to tell them that night It was empty save
for a few old bottles

Well thats that said Bill

But Antony on his knees with the torch in his hand continued to search
for something

What are you looking for asked Bill at last

Something that isnt there said Antony getting up and dusting his
trousers And he locked the door again




CHAPTER XVIII Guesswork


The inquest was at three oclock thereafter Antony could have no claim
on the hospitality of the Red House By ten oclock his bag was packed
and waiting to be taken to The George To Bill coming upstairs after
a more prolonged breakfast this early morning bustle was a little
surprising

Whats the hurry he asked

None But we dont want to come back here after the inquest Get your
packing over now and then we can have the morning to ourselves

Righto He turned to go to his room and then came back again I say
are we going to tell Cayley that were staying at The George

Youre not staying at The George Bill Not officially Youre going
back to London

Oh

Yes Ask Cayley to have your luggage sent in to Stanton ready for you
when you catch a train there after the inquest You can tell him that
youve got to see the Bishop of London at once The fact that you are
hurrying back to London to be confirmed will make it seem more natural
that I should resume my interrupted solitude at The George as soon as
you have gone

Then where do I sleep tonight

Officially I suppose in Fulham Place unofficially I suspect in
my bed unless theyve got another spare room at The George Ive put
your confirmation robeI mean your pyjamas and brushes and thingsin
my bag ready for you Is there anything else you want to know No Then
go and pack And meet me at tenthirty beneath the blasted oak or in the
hall or somewhere I want to talk and talk and talk and I must have my
Watson

Good said Bill and went off to his room

An hour later having communicated their official plans to Cayley they
wandered out together into the park

Well said Bill as they sat down underneath a convenient tree Talk
away

I had many bright thoughts in my bath this morning began Antony The
brightest one of all was that we were being damn fools and working at
this thing from the wrong end altogether

Well thats helpful

Of course its very hampering being a detective when you dont know
anything about detecting and when nobody knows that youre doing
detection and you cant have people up to crossexamine them and you
have neither the energy nor the means to make proper inquiries and
in short when youre doing the whole thing in a thoroughly amateur
haphazard way

For amateurs I dont think were doing at all badly protested Bill

No not for amateurs But if we had been professionals I believe we
should have gone at it from the other end The Robert end Weve been
wondering about Mark and Cayley all the time Now lets wonder about
Robert for a bit

We know so little about him

Well lets see what we do know First of all then we know vaguely
that he was a bad lotthe sort of brother who is hushed up in front of
other people

Yes

We know that he announced his approaching arrival to Mark in a rather
unpleasant letter which I have in my pocket

Yes

And then we know rather a curious thing We know that Mark told you all
that this black sheep was coming Now why did he tell you

Bill was thoughtful for a moment

I suppose he said slowly that he knew we were bound to see him and
thought that the best way was to be quite frank about him

But were you bound to see him You were all away playing golf

We were bound to see him if he stayed in the house that night

Very well then Thats one thing weve discovered Mark knew that
Robert was staying in the house that night Or shall we put it this
wayhe knew that there was no chance of getting Robert out of the house
at once

Bill looked at his friend eagerly

Go on he said This is getting interesting

He also knew something else went on Antony He knew that Robert was
bound to betray his real character to you as soon as you met him
He couldnt pass him off on you as just a travelled brother from the
Dominions with perhaps a bit of an accent he had to tell you at once
because you were bound to find out that Robert was a wastrel

Yes Thats sound enough

Well now doesnt it strike you that Mark made up his mind about all
that rather quickly

How do you mean

He got this letter at breakfast He read it and directly he had read
it he began to confide in you all That is to say in about one second
he thought out the whole business and came to a decisionto two
decisions He considered the possibility of getting Robert out of
the way before you came back and decided that it was impossible He
considered the possibility of Roberts behaving like an ordinary decent
person in public and decided that it was very unlikely He came to
those two decisions instantaneously as he was reading the letter Isnt
that rather quick work

Well whats the explanation

Antony waited until he had refilled and lighted his pipe before
answering

Whats the explanation Well lets leave it for a moment and take
another look at the two brothers In conjunction this time with Mrs
Norbury

Mrs Norbury said Bill surprised

Yes Mark hoped to marry Miss Norbury Now if Robert really was a blot
upon the family honour Mark would want to do one of two things Either
keep it from the Norburys altogether or else if it had to come out
tell them himself before the news came to them indirectly Well he told
them But the funny thing is that he told them the day before
Roberts letter came Robert came and was killed the day before
yesterdayTuesday Mark told Mrs Norbury about him on Monday What do
you make of that

Coincidence said Bill after careful thought Hed always meant
to tell her his suit was prospering and just before it was finally
settled he told her That happened to be Monday On Tuesday he got
Roberts letter and felt jolly glad that hed told her in time

Well it might be that but its rather a curious coincidence And here
is something which makes it very curious indeed It only occurred to
me in the bath this morning Inspiring place a bathroom Well its
thishe told her on Monday morning on his way to Middleston in the
car

Well

Well

Sorry Tony Im dense this morning

In the car Bill And how near can the car get to Jallands

About six hundred yards

Yes And on his way to Middleston on some business or other Mark
stops the car walks six hundred yards down the hill to Jallands says
Oh by the way Mrs Norbury I dont think I ever told you that I
have a shady brother called Robert walks six hundred yards up the hill
again gets into the car and goes off to Middleston Is that likely

Bill frowned heavily

Yes but I dont see what youre getting at Likely or not likely we
know he did do it

Of course he did All I mean is that he must have had some strong
reason for telling Mrs Norbury at once And the reason I suggest is
that he knew on that morningMonday morning not Tuesdaythat Robert
was coming to see him and had to be in first with the news

Butbut

And that would explain the other pointhis instantaneous decision at
breakfast to tell you all about his brother It wasnt instantaneous He
knew on Monday that Robert was coming and decided then that you would
all have to know

Then how do you explain the letter

Well lets have a look at it

Antony took the letter from his pocket and spread it out on the grass
between them

Mark your loving brother is coming to see you tomorrow all the way
from Australia I give you warning so that you will be able to conceal
your surprise but not I hope your pleasure Expect him at three or
thereabouts

No date mentioned you see said Antony Just tomorrow

But he got this on Tuesday

Did he

Well he read it out to us on Tuesday

Oh yes he read it out to you

Bill read the letter again and then turned it over and looked at the
back of it The back of it had nothing to say to him

What about the postmark he asked

We havent got the envelope unfortunately

And you think that he got this letter on Monday

Im inclined to think so Bill Anyhow I thinkI feel almost
certainthat he knew on Monday that his brother was coming

Is that going to help us much

No It makes it more difficult Theres something rather uncanny about
it all I dont understand it He was silent for a little and then
added I wonder if the inquest is going to help us

What about last night Im longing to hear what you make of that Have
you been thinking it out at all

Last night said Antony thoughtfully to himself Yes last night
wants some explaining

Bill waited hopefully for him to explain What for instance had Antony
been looking for in the cupboard

I think began Antony slowly that after last night we must give up
the idea that Mark has been killed killed I mean by Cayley I dont
believe anybody would go to so much trouble to hide a suit of clothes
when he had a body on his hands The body would seem so much more
important I think we may take it now that the clothes are all that
Cayley had to hide

But why not have kept them in the passage

He was frightened of the passage Miss Norris knew about it

Well then in his own bedroom or even in Marks For all you or I
or anybody knew Mark might have had two brown suits He probably had I
should think

Probably But I doubt if that would reassure Cayley The brown suit
hid a secret and therefore the brown suit had to be hidden We all
know that in theory the safest hidingplace is the most obvious but in
practice very few people have the nerve to risk it

Bill looked rather disappointed

Then we just come back to where we were he complained Mark killed
his brother and Cayley helped him to escape through the passage either
in order to compromise him or because there was no other way out of it
And he helped him by telling a lie about his brown suit

Antony smiled at him in genuine amusement

Bad luck Bill he said sympathetically Theres only one murder
after all Im awfully sorry about it It was my fault for

Shut up you ass You know I didnt mean that

Well you seemed awfully disappointed

Bill said nothing for a little and then with a sudden laugh confessed

It was so exciting yesterday he said apologetically and we seemed
to be just getting there and discovering the most wonderful things and
now

And now

Well its so much more ordinary

Antony gave a shout of laughter

Ordinary he cried Ordinary Well Im dashed Ordinary If only
one thing would happen in an ordinary way we might do something but
everything is ridiculous Bill brightened up again

Ridiculous How

Every way Take those ridiculous clothes we found last night You can
explain the brown suit but why the under clothes You can explain the
underclothes in some absurd way if you likeyou can say that Mark
always changed his underclothes whenever he interviewed anybody from
Australiabut why in that case my dear Watson why didnt he change
his collar

His collar said Bill in amazement

His collar Watson

I dont understand

And its all so ordinary scoffed Antony

Sorry Tony I didnt mean that Tell me about the collar

Well thats all There was no collar in the bag last night Shirt
socks tieeverything except a collar Why

Was that what you were looking for in the cupboard said Bill eagerly

Of course Why no collar I said For some reason Cayley considered
it necessary to hide all Marks clothes not just the suit but
everything which he was wearing or supposed to be wearing at the time
of the murder But he hadnt hidden the collar Why Had he left it out
by mistake So I looked in the cupboard It wasnt there Had he left it
out on purpose If so whyand where was it Naturally I began to say
to myself Where have I seen a collar lately A collar all by itself
And I rememberedwhat Bill

Bill frowned heavily to himself and shook his head

Dont ask me Tony I cantBy Jove He threw up his head In the
basket in the office bedroom

Exactly

But is that the one

The one that goes with the rest of the clothes I dont know Where
else can it be But if so why send the collar quite casually to the
wash in the ordinary way and take immense trouble to hide everything
else Why why why

Bill bit hard at his pipe but could think of nothing to say

Anyhow said Antony getting up restlessly Im certain of one thing
Mark knew on the Monday that Robert was coming here




CHAPTER XIX The Inquest


The Coroner having made a few commonplace remarks as to the terrible
nature of the tragedy which they had come to investigate that afternoon
proceeded to outline the case to the jury Witnesses would be called to
identify the deceased as Robert Ablett the brother of the owner of the
Red House Mark Ablett It would be shown that he was something of a
neerdowell who had spent most of his life in Australia and that he
had announced in what might almost be called a threatening letter
his intention of visiting his brother that afternoon There would
be evidence of his arrival of his being shown into the scene of the
tragedya room in the Red House commonly called the officeand of
his brothers entrance into that room The jury would have to form their
own opinion as to what happened there But whatever happened happened
almost instantaneously Within two minutes of Mark Abletts entrance as
would be shown in the evidence a shot was heard and whenperhaps five
minutes laterthe room was forced open the dead body of Robert Ablett
was found stretched upon the floor As regards Mark Ablett nobody had
seen him from the moment of his going into the room but evidence would
be called to show that he had enough money on him at the time to take
him to any other part of the country and that a man answering to
his description had been observed on the platform of Stanton station
apparently waiting to catch the 355 up train to London As the jury
would realize such evidence of identity was not always reliable
Missing men had a way of being seen in a dozen different places at once
In any case there was no doubt that for the moment Mark Ablett had
disappeared

Seems a sound man whispered Antony to Bill Doesnt talk too much

Antony did not expect to learn much from the evidencehe knew the
facts of the case so well by nowbut he wondered if Inspector Birch had
developed any new theories If so they would appear in the Coroners
examination for the Coroner would certainly have been coached by the
police as to the important facts to be extracted from each witness Bill
was the first to be put through it

Now about this letter Mr Beverley he was asked when his chief
evidence was over Did you see it at all

I didnt see the actual writing I saw the back of it Mark was holding
it up when he told us about his brother

You dont know what was in it then

Bill had a sudden shock He had read the letter only that morning He
knew quite well what was in it But it wouldnt do to admit this And
then just as he was about to perjure himself he remembered Antony had
heard Cayley telling the Inspector

I knew afterwards I was told But Mark didnt read it out at
breakfast

You gathered however that it was an unwelcome letter

Oh yes

Would you say that Mark was frightened by it

Not frightened Sort of bitterand resigned Sort of Oh Lord here
we are again

There was a titter here and there The Coroner smiled and tried to
pretend that he hadnt

Thank you Mr Beverley

The next witness was summoned by the name of Andrew Amos and Antony
looked up with interest wondering who he was

He lives at the inner lodge whispered Bill to him

All that Amos had to say was that a stranger had passed by his lodge at
a little before three that afternoon and had spoken to him He had seen
the body and recognized it as the man

What did he say

Is this right for the Red House or something like that sir

What did you say

I said This is the Red House Who do you want to see He was a
bit roughlooking you know sir and I didnt know what he was doing
there

Well

Well sir he said Is Mister Mark Ablett at home It doesnt sound
much put like that sir but I didnt care about the way he said it
So I got in front of him like and said What do you want eh and he
gave a sort of chuckle and said I want to see my dear brother Mark
Well then I took a closer look at him and I see that praps he might
be his brother so I said If youll follow the drive sir youll come
to the house Of course I cant say if Mr Abletts at home And he
gave a sort of nasty laugh again and said Fine place Mister Mark
Abletts got here Plenty of money to spend eh Well then I had
another look at him sir because gentlemen dont talk like that and
if he was Mr Abletts brotherbut before I could make up my mind he
laughed and went on Thats all I can tell you sir

Andrew Amos stepped down and moved away to the back of the room nor did
Antony take his eyes off him until he was assured that Amos intended to
remain there until the inquest was over

Whos Amos talking to now he whispered to Bill

Parsons One of the gardeners Hes at the outside lodge on the Stanton
road Theyre all here today Sort of holiday for em

I wonder if hes giving evidence too thought Antony He was He
followed Amos He had been at work on the lawn in front of the house
and had seen Robert Ablett arrive He didnt hear the shotnot to
notice He was a little hard of hearing He had seen a gentleman arrive
about five minutes after Mr Robert

Can you see him in court now asked the Coroner Parsons looked round
slowly Antony caught his eye and smiled

Thats him said Parsons pointing

Everybody looked at Antony

That was about five minutes afterwards

About that sir

Did anybody come out of the house before this gentlemans arrival

No sir That is to say I didnt see em

Stevens followed She gave her evidence much as she had given it to the
Inspector Nothing new was brought out by her examination Then came
Elsie As the reporters scribbled down what she had overheard they
added in brackets Sensation for the first time that afternoon

How soon after you had heard this did the shot come asked the
Coroner

Almost at once sir

A minute

I couldnt really say sir It was so quick

Were you still in the hall

Oh no sir I was just outside Mrs Stevens room The housekeeper
sir

You didnt think of going back to the hall to see what had happened

Oh no sir I just went in to Mrs Stevens and she said Oh what
was that frightenedlike And I said That was in the house Mrs
Stevens that was Just like something going off it was

Thank you said the Coroner

There was another emotional disturbance in the room as Cayley went into
the witnessbox not Sensation this time but an eager and as it
seemed to Antony sympathetic interest Now they were getting to grips
with the drama

He gave his evidence carefully unemotionallythe lies with the same
slow deliberation as the truth Antony watched him intently wondering
what it was about him which had this odd sort of attractiveness For
Antony who knew that he was lying and lying as he believed not for
Marks sake but his own yet could not help sharing some of that general
sympathy with him

Was Mark ever in possession of a revolver asked the Coroner

Not to my knowledge I think I should have known if he had been

You were alone with him all that morning Did he talk about this visit
of Roberts at all

I didnt see very much of him in the morning I was at work in my room
and outside and so on We lunched together and he talked of it then a
little

In what terms

Well he hesitated and then went on I cant think of a better word
than peevishly Occasionally he said What do you think he wants or
Why couldnt he have stayed where he was or I dont like the tone
of his letter Do you think he means trouble He talked rather in that
kind of way

Did he express his surprise that his brother should be in England

I think he was always afraid that he would turn up one day

Yes You didnt hear any conversation between the brothers when they
were in the office together

No I happened to go into the library just after Mark had gone in and
I was there all the time

Was the library door open

Oh yes

Did you see or hear the last witness at all

No

If anybody had come out of the office while you were in the library
would you have heard it

I think so Unless they had come out very quietly on purpose

Would you call Mark a hastytempered man

Cayley considered this carefully before answering

Hastytempered yes he said But not violenttempered

Was he fairly athletic Active and quick

Active and quick yes Not particularly strong

Yes One question more Was Mark in the habit of carrying any
considerable sum of money about with him

Yes He always had one 100 pound note on him and perhaps ten or twenty
pounds as well

Thank you Mr Cayley

Cayley went back heavily to his seat Damn it said Antony to himself
why do I like the fellow

Antony Gillingham

Again the eager interest of the room could be felt Who was this
stranger who had got mixed up in the business so mysteriously

Antony smiled at Bill and stepped up to give his evidence

He explained how he came to be staying at The George at Waldheim how
he had heard that the Red House was in the neighbourhood how he had
walked over to see his friend Beverley and had arrived just after the
tragedy Thinking it over afterwards he was fairly certain that he had
heard the shot but it had not made any impression on him at the time
He had come to the house from the Waldheim end and consequently had seen
nothing of Robert Ablett who had been a few minutes in front of him
From this point his evidence coincided with Cayleys

You and the last witness reached the French windows together and found
them shut

Yes

You pushed them in and came to the body Of course you had no idea
whose body it was

No

Did Mr Cayley say anything

He turned the body over just so as to see the face and when he saw
it he said Thank God

Again the reporters wrote Sensation

Did you understand what he meant by that

I asked him who it was and he said that it was Robert Ablett Then
he explained that he was afraid at first it was the cousin with whom he
livedMark

Yes Did he seem upset

Very much so at first Less when he found that it wasnt Mark

There was a sudden snigger from a nervous gentleman in the crowd at the
back of the room and the Coroner put on his glasses and stared sternly
in the direction from which it came The nervous gentleman hastily
decided that the time had come to do up his bootlace The Coroner put
down his glasses and continued

Did anybody come out of the house while you were coming up the drive

No

Thank you Mr Gillingham

He was followed by Inspector Birch The Inspector realizing that
this was his afternoon and that the eyes of the world were upon
him produced a plan of the house and explained the situation of the
different rooms The plan was then handed to the jury

Inspector Birch so he told the world had arrived at the Red House
at 442 pm on the afternoon in question He had been received by Mr
Matthew Cayley who had made a short statement to him and he had then
proceeded to examine the scene of the crime The French windows had been
forced from outside The door leading into the hall was locked he had
searched the room thoroughly and had found no trace of a key In the
bedroom leading out of the office he had found an open window There
were no marks on the window but it was a low one and as he found
from experiment quite easy to step out of without touching it with the
boots A few yards outside the window a shrubbery began There were no
recent footmarks outside the window but the ground was in a very hard
condition owing to the absence of rain In the shrubbery however he
found several twigs on the ground recently broken off together with
other evidence that some body had been forcing its way through He had
questioned everybody connected with the estate and none of them had
been into the shrubbery recently By forcing a way through the shrubbery
it was possible for a person to make a detour of the house and get to
the Stanton end of the park without ever being in sight of the house
itself

He had made inquiries about the deceased Deceased had left for
Australia some fifteen years ago owing to some financial trouble at
home Deceased was not well spoken of in the village from which he and
his brother had come Deceased and his brother had never been on good
terms and the fact that Mark Ablett had come into money had been a
cause of great bitterness between them It was shortly after this that
Robert had left for Australia

He had made inquiries at Stanton station It had been marketday at
Stanton and the station had been more full of arrivals than usual
Nobody had particularly noticed the arrival of Robert Ablett there had
been a good many passengers by the 210 train that afternoon the train
by which Robert had undoubtedly come from London A witness however
would state that he noticed a man resembling Mark Ablett at the station
at 353 pm that afternoon and this man caught the 355 up train to
town

There was a pond in the grounds of the Red House He had dragged this
but without result

Antony listened to him carelessly thinking his own thoughts all the
time Medical evidence followed but there was nothing to be got from
that He felt so close to the truth at any moment something might give
his brain the one little hint which it wanted Inspector Birch was just
pursuing the ordinary Whatever else this case was it was not ordinary
There was something uncanny about it

John Borden was giving evidence He was on the up platform seeing a
friend off by the 355 on Tuesday afternoon He had noticed a man on the
platform with coat collar turned up and a scarf round his chin He had
wondered why the man should do this on such a hot day The man seemed to
be trying to escape observation Directly the train came in he hurried
into a carriage And so on

Theres always a John Borden at every murder case said Antony to
himself

Have you ever seen Mark Ablett

Once or twice sir

Was it he

I never really got a good look at him sir what with his collar turned
up and the scarf and all But directly I heard of the sad affair and
that Mr Ablett was missing I said to Mrs Borden Now I wonder if
that was Mr Ablett I saw at the station So then we talked it over and
decided that I ought to come and tell Inspector Birch It was just Mr
Abletts height sir

Antony went on with his thoughts

The Coroner was summing up The jury he said had now heard all the
evidence and would have to decide what had happened in that room between
the two brothers How had the deceased met his death The medical
evidence would probably satisfy them that Robert Ablett had died from
the effects of a bulletwound in the head Who had fired that bullet
If Robert Ablett had fired it himself no doubt they would bring in
a verdict of suicide but if this had been so where was the revolver
which had fired it and what had become of Mark Ablett If they
disbelieved in this possibility of suicide what remained Accidental
death justifiable homicide and murder Could the deceased have been
killed accidentally It was possible but then would Mark Ablett have
run away The evidence that he had run away from the scene of the crime
was strong His cousin had seen him go into the room the servant Elsie
Wood had heard him quarrelling with his brother in the room the door
had been locked from the inside and there were signs that outside
the open window some one had pushed his way very recently through the
shrubbery Who if not Mark They would have then to consider whether he
would have run away if he had been guiltless of his brothers death No
doubt innocent people lost their heads sometimes It was possible that
if it were proved afterwards that Mark Ablett had shot his brother it
might also be proved that he was justified in so doing and that when he
ran away from his brothers corpse he had really nothing to fear at the
hands of the Law In this connection he need hardly remind the jury that
they were not the final tribunal and that if they found Mark Ablett
guilty of murder it would not prejudice his trial in any way if and when
he was apprehended The jury could consider their verdict

They considered it They announced that the deceased had died as the
result of a bulletwound and that the bullet had been fired by his
brother Mark Ablett

Bill turned round to Antony at his side But Antony was gone Across the
room he saw Andrew Amos and Parsons going out of the door together and
Antony was between them




CHAPTER XX Mr Beverley is Tactful


The inquest had been held at the Lamb at Stanton at Stanton Robert
Ablett was to be buried next day Bill waited about outside for his
friend wondering where he had gone Then realizing that Cayley would
be coming out to his car directly and that a farewell talk with Cayley
would be a little embarrassing he wandered round to the yard at
the back of the inn lit a cigarette and stood surveying a torn and
weatherbeaten poster on the stable wall GRAND THEATRICAL ENTER it
announced to take place on Wednesday Decem Bill smiled to himself
as he looked at it for the part of Joe a loquacious postman had
been played by William B Beverl as the remnants of the poster still
maintained and he had been much less loquacious than the author had
intended having forgotten his words completely but it had all been
great fun And then he stopped smiling for there would be no more fun
now at the Red House

Sorry to keep you waiting said the voice of Antony behind him My
old friends Amos and Parsons insisted on giving me a drink

He slipped his hand into the crook of Bills arm and smiled happily at
him

Why were you so keen about them asked Bill a little resentfully I
couldnt think where on earth you had got to

Antony didnt say anything He was staring at the poster

When did this happen he asked

What

Antony waved to the poster

Oh that Last Christmas It was rather fun

Antony began to laugh to himself

Were you good

Rotten I dont profess to be an actor

Mark good

Oh rather He loves it

Rev Henry StuttersMr Matthew Cay read Antony

Was that our friend Cayley

Yes

Any good

Well much better than I expected He wasnt keen but Mark made him

Miss Norris wasnt playing I see

My dear Tony shes a professional Of course she wasnt

Antony laughed again

A great success was it

Oh rather

Im a fool and a damned fool Antony announced solemnly And a
damned fool he said again under his breath as he led Bill away from
the poster and out of the yard into the road And a damned fool Even
now He broke off and then asked suddenly Did Mark ever have much
trouble with his teeth

He went to his dentist a good deal But what on earth

Antony laughed a third time

What luck he chuckled But how do you know

We go to the same man Mark recommended him to me Cartwright in
Wimpole Street

Cartwright in Wimpole Street repeated Antony thoughtfully Yes I
can remember that Cartwright in Wimpole Street Did Cayley go to him
too by any chance

I expect so Oh yes I know he did But what on earth

What was Marks general health like Did he see a doctor much

Hardly at all I should think He did a lot of early morning exercises
which were supposed to make him bright and cheerful at breakfast They
didnt do that but they seemed to keep him pretty fit Tony I wish
youd

Antony held up a hand and hushed him into silence

One last question he said Was Mark fond of swimming

No he hated it I dont believe he could swim Tony are you mad or
am I Or is this a new game

Antony squeezed his arm

Dear old Bill he said Its a game What a game And the answer is
Cartwright in Wimpole Street

They walked in silence for half a mile or so along the road to Waldheim
Bill tried two or three times to get his friend to talk but Antony had
only grunted in reply He was just going to make another attempt when
Antony came to a sudden stop and turned to him anxiously

I wonder if youd do something for me he said looking at him with
some doubt

What sort of thing

Well its really dashed important Its just the one thing I want
now

Bill was suddenly enthusiastic again

I say have you really found it all out

Antony nodded

At least Im very nearly there Bill Theres just this one thing I
want now It means your going back to Stanton Well we havent come
far it wont take you long Do you mind

My dear Holmes I am at your service

Antony gave him a smile and was silent for a little thinking

Is there another inn at Stantonfairly close to the station

The Plough and Horsesjust at the corner where the road goes up to
the stationis that the one you mean

That would be the one I suppose you could do with a drink couldnt
you

Rather said Bill with a grin

Good Then have one at the Plough and Horses Have two if you like
and talk to the landlord or landlady or whoever serves you I want you
to find out if anybody stayed there on Monday night

Robert said Bill eagerly

I didnt say Robert said Antony smiling I just want you to find
out if they had a visitor who slept there on Monday night A stranger
If so then any particulars you can get of him without letting the
landlord know that you are interested

Leave it to me broke in Bill I know just what you want

Dont assume that it was Robertor anybody else Let them describe the
man to you Dont influence them unconsciously by suggesting that he was
short or tall or anything of that sort Just get them talking If its
the landlord youd better stand him a drink or two

Right you are said Bill confidently Where do I meet you again

Probably at The George If you get there before me you can order
dinner for eight oclock Anyhow well meet at eight if not before

Good He nodded to Antony and strode off back to Stanton again

Antony stood watching him with a little smile at his enthusiasm Then he
looked round slowly as if in search of something Suddenly he saw what
he wanted Twenty yards farther on a lane wandered off to the left and
there was a gate a little way up on the righthand side of it Antony
walked to the gate filling his pipe as he went Then he lit his pipe
sat on the gate and took his head in his hands

Now then he said to himself lets begin at the beginning

It was nearly eight oclock when William Beverley the famous
sleuthhound arrived tired and dusty at The George to find Antony
cool and clean standing bareheaded at the door waiting for him

Is dinner ready were Bills first words

Yes

Then Ill just have a wash Lord Im tired

I never ought to have asked you said Antony penitently

Thats all right I shant be a moment Halfway up the stairs he
turned round and asked Am I in your room

Yes Do you know the way

Yes Start carving will you And order lots of beer He disappeared
round the top of the staircase Antony went slowly in

When the first edge of his appetite had worn off and he was able to
spare a little time between the mouthfuls Bill gave an account of his
adventures The landlord of the Plough and Horses had been sticky
decidedly stickyBill had been unable at first to get anything out of
him But Bill had been tactful lorblessyou how tactful he had been

He kept on about the inquest and what a queer affair it had been and
so on and how thered been an inquest in his wifes family once
which he seemed rather proud about and I kept saying Pretty busy I
suppose just now what and then hed say Middlin and go on again
about Susanthat was the one that had the inquesthe talked about it
as if it were a diseaseand then Id try again and say Slack times
I expect just now eh and hed say Middlin again and then it was
time to offer him another drink and I didnt seem to be getting much
nearer But I got him at last I asked him if he knew John Bordenhe
was the man who said hed seen Mark at the station Well he knew all
about Borden and after hed told me all about Bordens wifes family
and how one of them had been burnt to deathafter you with the beer
thankswell then I said carelessly that it must be very hard to
remember anybody whom you had just seen once so as to identify him
afterwards and he agreed that it would be middlin hard and then

Give me three guesses interrupted Antony You asked him if he
remembered everybody who came to his inn

Thats it Bright wasnt it

Brilliant And what was the result

The result was a woman

A woman said Antony eagerly

A woman said Bill impressively Of course I thought it was going to
be Robertso did you didnt youbut it wasnt It was a woman Came
quite late on Monday night in a cardriving herselfwent off early
next morning

Did he describe her

Yes She was middlin Middlin tall middlin age middlin colour
and so on Doesnt help much does it But stilla woman Does that
upset your theory

Antony shook his head

No Bill not at all he said

You knew all the time At least you guessed

Wait till tomorrow Ill tell you everything tomorrow

Tomorrow said Bill in great disappointment

Well Ill tell you one thing tonight if youll promise not to ask
any more questions But you probably know it already

What is it

Only that Mark Ablett did not kill his brother

And Cayley did

Thats another question Bill However the answer is that Cayley
didnt either

Then who on earth

Have some more beer said Antony with a smile And Bill had to be
content with that

They were early to bed that evening for both of them were tired Bill
slept loudly and defiantly but Antony lay awake wondering What was
happening at the Red House now Perhaps he would hear in the morning
perhaps he would get a letter He went over the whole story again from
the beginningwas there any possibility of a mistake What would the
police do Would they ever find out Ought he to have told them Well
let them find out it was their job Surely he couldnt have made a
mistake this time No good wondering now he would know definitely in
the morning

In the morning there was a letter for him




CHAPTER XXI Cayleys Apology

My Dear Mr Gillingham

I gather from your letter that you have made certain discoveries which
you may feel it your duty to communicate to the police and that in this
case my arrest on a charge of murder would inevitably follow Why
in these circumstances you should give me such ample warning of your
intentions I do not understand unless it is that you are not wholly out
of sympathy with me But whether or not you sympathize at any rate you
will want to knowand I want you to knowthe exact manner in which
Ablett met his death and the reasons which made that death necessary If
the police have to be told anything I would rather that they too knew
the whole story They and even you may call it murder but by that
time I shall be out of the way Let them call it what they like

I must begin by taking you back to a summer day fifteen years ago when
I was a boy of thirteen and Mark a young man of twentyfive His
whole life was makebelieve and just now he was pretending to be a
philanthropist He sat in our little drawingroom flicking his gloves
against the back of his left hand and my mother good soul thought
what a noble young gentleman he was and Philip and I hastily washed
and crammed into collars stood in front of him nudging each other and
kicking the backs of our heels and cursing him in our hearts for having
interrupted our game He had decided to adopt one of us kind Cousin
Mark Heaven knows why he chose me Philip was eleven two years longer
to wait Perhaps that was why

Well Mark educated me I went to a public school and to Cambridge
and I became his secretary Well much more than his secretary as your
friend Beverley perhaps has told you his land agent his financial
adviser his courier hisbut this most of allhis audience Mark
could never live alone There must always be somebody to listen to him
I think in his heart he hoped I should be his Boswell He told me one
day that he had made me his literary executorpoor devil And he used
to write me the absurdest long letters when I was away from him letters
which I read once and then tore up The futility of the man

It was three years ago that Philip got into trouble He had been
hurried through a cheap grammar school and into a London office and
discovered there that there was not much fun to be got in this world on
two pounds a week I had a frantic letter from him one day saying that
he must have a hundred at once or he would be ruined and I went to
Mark for the money Only to borrow it you understand he gave me a good
salary and I could have paid it back in three months But no He saw
nothing for himself in it I suppose no applause no admiration
Philips gratitude would be to me not to him I begged I threatened
we argued and while we were arguing Philip was arrested It killed
my motherhe was always her favouritebut Mark as usual got his
satisfaction out of it He preened himself on his judgment of character
in having chosen me and not Philip twelve years before

Later on I apologized to Mark for the reckless things I had said
to him and he played the part of a magnanimous gentleman with his
accustomed skill but though outwardly we were as before to each other
from that day forward though his vanity would never let him see it I
was his bitterest enemy If that had been all I wonder if I should have
killed him To live on terms of intimate friendship with a man whom you
hate is dangerous work for your friend Because of his belief in me
as his admiring and grateful protege and his belief in himself as my
benefactor he was now utterly in my power I could take my time and
choose my opportunity Perhaps I should not have killed him but I had
sworn to have my revengeand there he was poor vain fool at my mercy
I was in no hurry

Two years later I had to reconsider my position for my revenge was
being taken out of my hands Mark began to drink Could I have stopped
him I dont think so but to my immense surprise I found myself trying
to Instinct perhaps getting the better of reason or did I reason it
out and tell myself that if he drank himself to death I should lose
my revenge Upon my word I cannot tell you but for whatever motive I
did genuinely want to stop it Drinking is such a beastly thing anyhow

I could not stop him but I kept him within certain bounds so that
nobody but myself knew his secret Yes I kept him outwardly decent
and perhaps now I was becoming like the cannibal who keeps his victim in
good condition for his own ends I used to gloat over Mark thinking how
utterly he was mine to ruin as I pleased financially morally whatever
way would give me most satisfaction I had but to take my hand away from
him and he sank But again I was in no hurry

Then he killed himself That futile little drunkard eaten up with his
own selfishness and vanity offered his beastliness to the truest and
purest woman on this earth You have seen her Mr Gillingham but you
never knew Mark Ablett Even if he had not been a drunkard there was
no chance for her of happiness with him I had known him for many years
but never once had I seen him moved by any generous emotion To have
lived with that shrivelled little soul would have been hell for her and
a thousand times worse hell when he began to drink

So he had to be killed I was the only one left to protect her for
her mother was in league with Mark to bring about her ruin I would have
shot him openly for her sake and with what gladness but I had no mind
to sacrifice myself needlessly He was in my power I could persuade him
to almost anything by flattery surely it would not be difficult to give
his death the appearance of an accident

I need not take up your time by telling you of the many plans I made
and rejected For some days I inclined towards an unfortunate boating
accident in the pondMark a very indifferent swimmer myself almost
exhausted in a gallant attempt to hold him up And then he himself gave
me the idea he and Miss Norris between them and so put himself in
my hands without risk of discovery I should have said had you not
discovered me

We were talking about ghosts Mark had been even more vain pompous and
absurd than usual and I could see that Miss Norris was irritated by it
After dinner she suggested dressing up as a ghost and frightening him
I thought it my duty to warn her that Mark took any joke against
himself badly but she was determined to do it I gave way reluctantly
Reluctantly also I told her the secret of the passage There is an
underground passage from the library to the bowlinggreen You should
exercise your ingenuity Mr Gillingham in trying to discover it Mark
came upon it by accident a year ago It was a godsend to him he could
drink there in greater secrecy But he had to tell me about it He
wanted an audience even for his vices

I told Miss Norris then because it was necessary for my plan that
Mark should be thoroughly frightened Without the passage she could
never have got close enough to the bowlinggreen to alarm him properly
but as I arranged it with her she made the most effective appearance
and Mark was in just the state of rage and vindictiveness which I
required Miss Norris you understand is a professional actress I need
not say that to her I appeared to be animated by no other feeling than a
boyish desire to bring off a good jokea joke directed as much against
the others as against Mark

He came to me that night as I expected still quivering with
indignation Miss Norris must never be asked to the house again I was
to make a special note of it never again It was outrageous Had he not
a reputation as a host to keep up he would pack her off next morning
As it was she could stay hospitality demanded it but never again
would she come to the Red Househe was absolutely determined about
that I was to make a special note of it

I comforted him I smoothed down his ruffled feathers She had behaved
very badly but he was quite right he must try not to show how much he
disapproved of her And of course she would never come againthat
was obvious And then suddenly I began to laugh He looked up at me
indignantly

Is there a joke he said coldly

I laughed gently again

I was just thinking I said that it would be rather amusing if
youwell had your revenge

My revenge How do you mean

Well paid her back in her own coin

Do you mean try and frighten her

No no but dressed up and pulled her leg a bit Made her look a fool
in front of the others I laughed to myself again Serve her jolly
well right

He jumped up excitedly

By Jove Cay he cried If I could How You must think of a way

I dont know if Beverley has told you about Marks acting He was an
amateur of all the arts and vain of his little talents but as an actor
he seemed to himself most wonderful Certainly he had some ability for
the stage so long as he had the stage to himself and was playing to an
admiring audience As a professional actor in a small part he would have
been hopeless as an amateur playing the leading part he deserved all
that the local papers had ever said about him And so the idea of giving
us a private performance directed against a professional actress who
had made fun of him appealed equally to his vanity and his desire for
retaliation If he Mark Ablett by his wonderful acting could make Ruth
Norris look a fool in front of the others could take her in and then
join in the laugh at her afterwards he would indeed have had a worthy
revenge

It strikes you as childish Mr Gillingham Ah you never knew Mark
Ablett

How Cay how he said eagerly

Well I havent really thought it out I protested It was just an
idea

He began to think it out for himself

I might pretend to be a manager come down to see herbut I suppose
she knows them all What about an interviewer

Its going to be difficult I said thoughtfully Youve got rather a
characteristic face you know And your beard

Id shave it off he snapped

My dear Mark

He looked away and mumbled Ive been thinking of taking it off
anyhow And besides if Im going to do the thing Im going to do it
properly

Yes you always were an artist I said looking at him admiringly

He purred To be called an artist was what he longed for most Now I
knew that I had him

All the same I went on even without your beard and moustache you
might be recognizable Unless of course I broke off

Unless what

You pretend to be Robert I began to laugh to myself again By
Jove I said thats not a bad idea Pretend to be Robert the wastrel
brother and make yourself objectionable to Miss Norris Borrow money
from her and that sort of thing

He looked at me with his bright little eyes nodding eagerly

Robert he said Yes How shall we work it

There was really a Robert Mr Gillingham as I have no doubt you
and the Inspector both discovered And he was a wastrel and he went to
Australia But he never came to the Red House on Tuesday afternoon He
couldnt have because he died unlamented three years ago But there
was nobody who knew this save Mark and myself for Mark was the only
one of the family left his sister having died last year Though I
doubt anyhow if she knew whether Robert was alive or dead He was not
talked about

For the next two days Mark and I worked out our plans You understand
by now that our aims were not identical Marks endeavour was that his
deception should last for say a couple of hours mine that it should
go to the grave with him He had only to deceive Miss Norris and the
other guests I had to deceive the world When he was dressed up as
Robert I was going to kill him Robert would then be dead Mark of
course missing What could anybody think but that Mark had killed
Robert But you see how important it was for Mark to enter fully into
his latest and last impersonation Halfmeasures would be fatal

You will say that it was impossible to do the thing thoroughly enough
I answer again that you never knew Mark He was being what he wished
most to bean artist No Othello ever blacked himself all over with
such enthusiasm as did Mark His beard was going anyhowpossible a
chance remark of Miss Norburys helped here She did not like beards
But it was important for me that the dead mans hands should not be the
hands of a manicured gentleman Five minutes playing upon the vanity of
the artist settled his hands He let the nails grow and then cut them
raggedly Miss Norris would notice your hands at once I had said
Besides as an artist

So with his underclothes It was hardly necessary to warn him that
his pants might show above the edge of his socks as an artist he had
already decided upon Robertian pants I bought them and other things
in London for him Even if I had not cut out all trace of the makers
name he would instinctively have done it As an Australian and an
artist he could not have an East London address on his underclothes
Yes we were doing the thing thoroughly both of us he as an artist I
as awell you may say murderer if you like I shall not mind now

Our plans were settled I went to London on the Monday and wrote him
a letter from Robert The artistic touch again I also bought a
revolver On the Tuesday morning he announced the arrival of Robert
at the breakfasttable Robert was now alivewe had six witnesses to
prove it six witnesses who knew that he was coming that afternoon Our
private plan was that Robert should present himself at three oclock
in readiness for the return of the golfingparty shortly afterwards The
maid would go to look for Mark and having failed to find him come back
to the office to find me entertaining Robert in Marks absence I
would explain that Mark must have gone out somewhere and would myself
introduce the wastrel brother to the teatable Marks absence would not
excite any comment for it would be generally feltindeed Robert would
suggest itthat he had been afraid of meeting his brother Then Robert
would make himself amusingly offensive to the guests particularly of
course Miss Norris until he thought that the joke had gone far enough

That was our private plan Perhaps I should say that it was Marks
private plan My own was different

The announcement at breakfast went well After the golfingparty had
gone off we had the morning in which to complete our arrangements What
I was chiefly concerned about was to establish as completely as possible
the identity of Robert For this reason I suggested to Mark that when
dressed he should go out by the secret passage to the bowlinggreen
and come back by the drive taking care to enter into conversation
with the lodgekeeper In this way I would have two more witnesses
of Roberts arrivalfirst the lodgekeeper and secondly one of the
gardeners whom I would have working on the front lawn Mark of course
was willing enough He could practise his Australian accent on the
lodgekeeper It was really amusing to see how readily he fell into
every suggestion which I made Never was a killing more carefully
planned by its victim

He changed into Roberts clothes in the office bedroom This was the
safest wayfor both of us When he was ready he called me in and
I inspected him It was extraordinary how well he looked the part I
suppose that the signs of his dissipation had already marked themselves
on his face but had been concealed hitherto by his moustache and
beard for now that he was cleanshaven they lay open to the world from
which we had so carefully hidden them and he was indeed the wastrel
which he was pretending to be

By Jove youre wonderful I said

He smirked and called my attention to the various artistic touches
which I might have missed

Wonderful I said to myself again Nobody could possibly guess

I peered into the hall It was empty We hurried across to the library
he got into the passage and made off I went back to the bedroom
collected all his discarded clothes did them up in a bundle and
returned with them to the passage Then I sat down in the hall and
waited

You heard the evidence of Stevens the maid As soon as she was on her
way to the Temple in search of Mark I stepped into the office My hand
was in my sidepocket and in my hand was the revolver

He began at once in his character of Robertsome rigmarole about
working his passage over from Australia a little private performance
for my edification Then in his natural voice gloating over his
wellplanned retaliation on Miss Norris he burst out Its my turn
now You wait It was this which Elsie heard She had no business to be
there and she might have ruined everything but as it turned out it was
the luckiest thing which could have happened For it was the one piece
of evidence which I wanted evidence other than my own that Mark and
Robert were in the room together

I said nothing I was not going to take the risk of being heard to
speak in that room I just smiled at the poor little fool and took
out my revolver and shot him Then I went back into the library and
waitedjust as I said in my evidence

Can you imagine Mr Gillingham the shock which your sudden appearance
gave me Can you imagine the feelings of a murderer who has as he
thinks planned for every possibility and is then confronted suddenly
with an utterly new problem What difference would your coming make I
didnt know Perhaps none perhaps all And I had forgotten to open the
window

I dont know whether you will think my plan for killing Mark a clever
one Perhaps not But if I do deserve any praise in the matter I think
I deserve it for the way I pulled myself together in the face of the
unexpected catastrophe of your arrival Yes I got a window open Mr
Gillingham under your very nose the right window too you were kind
enough to say And the keysyes that was clever of you but I think I
was cleverer I deceived you over the keys Mr Gillingham as I
learnt when I took the liberty of listening to a conversation on the
bowlinggreen between you and your friend Beverley Where was I Ah you
must have a look for that secret passage Mr Gillingham

But what am I saying Did I deceive you at all You have found out the
secretthat Robert was Markand that is all that matters How have
you found out I shall never know now Where did I go wrong Perhaps you
have been deceiving me all the time Perhaps you knew about the keys
about the window even about the secret passage You are a clever man
Mr Gillingham

I had Marks clothes on my hands I might have left them in the
passage but the secret of the passage was now out Miss Norris knew
it That was the weak point of my plan perhaps that Miss Norris had
to know it So I hid them in the pond the Inspector having obligingly
dragged it for me first A couple of keys joined them but I kept the
revolver Fortunate wasnt it Mr Gillingham

I dont think that there is any more to tell you This is a long
letter but then it is the last which I shall write There was a time
when I hoped that there might be a happy future for me not at the Red
House not alone Perhaps it was never more than an idle daydream
for I am no more worthy of her than Mark was But I could have made her
happy Mr Gillingham God how I would have worked to make her happy
But now that is impossible To offer her the hand of a murderer would be
as bad as to offer her the hand of a drunkard And Mark died for that
I saw her this morning She was very sweet It is a difficult world to
understand

Well well we are all gone nowthe Abletts and the Cayleys I wonder
what old Grandfather Cayley thinks of it all Perhaps it is as well that
we have died out Not that there was anything wrong with Sarahexcept
her temper And she had the Ablett noseyou cant do much with that
Im glad she left no children

Goodbye Mr Gillingham Im sorry that your stay with us was not of
a pleasanter nature but you understand the difficulties in which I was
placed Dont let Bill think too badly of me He is a good fellow look
after him He will be surprised The young are always surprised And
thank you for letting me end my own way I expect you did sympathize a
little you know We might have been friends in another worldyou and
I and I and she Tell her what you like Everything or nothing You
will know what is best Goodbye Mr Gillingham

MATTHEW CAYLEY

I am lonely tonight without Mark Thats funny isnt it




CHAPTER XXII Mr Beverley Moves On


Good Lord said Bill as he put down the letter

I thought youd say that murmured Antony

Tony do you mean to say that you knew all this

I guessed some of it I didnt quite know all of it of course

Good Lord said Bill again and returned to the letter In a moment he
was looking up again What did you write to him Was that last night
After Id gone into Stanton

Yes

What did you say That youd discovered that Mark was Robert

Yes At least I said that this morning I should probably telegraph to
Mr Cartwright of Wimpole Street and ask him to

Bill burst in eagerly on the top of the sentence Yes now what was all
that about You were so damn Sherlocky yesterday all of a sudden Wed
been doing the thing together all the time and youd been telling me
everything and then suddenly you become very mysterious and private and
talk enigmaticallyis that the wordabout dentists and swimming and
the Plough and Horses andwell what was it all about You simply
vanished out of sight I didnt know what on earth we were talking
about

Antony laughed and apologized

Sorry Bill I felt like that suddenly Just for the last halfhour
just to end up with Ill tell you everything now Not that theres
anything to tell really It seems so easy when you know itso obvious
About Mr Cartwright of Wimpole Street Of course he was just to
identify the body

But whatever made you think of a dentist for that

Who could do it better Could you have done it How could you Youd
never gone bathing with Mark youd never seen him stripped He didnt
swim Could his doctor do it Not unless hed had some particular
operation and perhaps not then But his dentists couldat any time
alwaysif he had been to his dentist fairly often Hence Mr Cartwright
of Wimpole Street

Bill nodded thoughtfully and went back again to the letter

I see And you told Cayley that you were telegraphing to Cartwright to
identify the body

Yes And then of course it was all up for him Once we knew that Robert
was Mark we knew everything

How did you know

Antony got up from the breakfast table and began to fill his pipe

Im not sure that I can say Bill You know those problems in Algebra
where you say Let x be the answer and then you work it out and find
what x is Well thats one way and another way which they never give
you any marks for at school is to guess the answer Pretend the answer
is 4well will that satisfy the conditions of the problem No Then
try 6 and if 6 doesnt either then what about 5and so on Well the
Inspector and the Coroner and all that lot had guessed their answer and
it seemed to fit but you and I knew it didnt really fit there were
several conditions in the problem which it didnt fit at all So we knew
that their answer was wrong and we had to think of anotheran answer
which explained all the things which were puzzling us Well I happened
to guess the right one Got a match

Bill handed him a box and he lit his pipe

Yes but that doesnt quite do old boy Something must have put you
on to it suddenly By the way Ill have my matches back if you dont
mind

Antony laughed and took them out of his pocket

Sorry Well then lets see if I can go through my own mind again
and tell you how I guessed it First of all the clothes

Yes

To Cayley the clothes seemed an enormously important clue I didnt
quite see why but I did realize that to a man in Cayleys position the
smallest clue would have an entirely disproportionate value For some
reason then Cayley attached this exaggerated importance to the clothes
which Mark was wearing on that Tuesday morning all the clothes the
inside ones as well as the outside ones I didnt know why but I
did feel certain that in that case the absence of the collar was
unintentional In collecting the clothes he had overlooked the collar
Why

It was the one in the linenbasket

Yes It seemed probable Why had Cayley put it there The obvious
answer was that he hadnt Mark had put it there I remembered what you
told me about Mark being finicky and having lots of clothes and so on
and I felt that he was just the sort of man who would never wear the
same collar twice He paused and then asked Is that right do you
think

Absolutely said Bill with conviction

Well I guessed it was So then I began to see an x which would fit
just this part of the problemthe clothes part I saw Mark changing
his clothes I saw him instinctively dropping the collar in the
linenbasket just as he had always dropped every collar he had ever
taken off but leaving the rest of the clothes on a chair in
the ordinary way and I saw Cayley collecting all the clothes
afterwardsall the visible clothesand not realizing that the collar
wasnt there

Go on said Bill eagerly

Well I felt pretty sure about that and I wanted an explanation of
it Why had Mark changed down there instead of in his bedroom The only
answer was that the fact of his changing had to be kept secret When did
he change The only possible time was between lunch when he would be
seen by the servants and the moment of Roberts arrival And when
did Cayley collect the clothes in a bundle Again the only answer was
Before Roberts arrival So another x was wantedto fit those three
conditions

And the answer was that a murder was intended even before Robert
arrived

Yes Well now it couldnt be intended on the strength of that letter
unless there was very much more behind the letter than we knew Nor was
it possible a murder could be intended without any more preparation than
the changing into a different suit in which to escape The thing was too
childish Also if Robert was to be murdered why go out of the way to
announce his existence to you alleven at the cost of some trouble to
Mrs Norbury What did it all mean I didnt know But I began to
feel now that Robert was an incident only that the plot was a plot of
Cayleys against Markeither to get him to kill his brother or to
get his brother to kill himand that for some inexplicable reason Mark
seemed to be lending himself to the plot He was silent for a little
and then said almost to himself I had seen the empty brandy bottles
in that cupboard

You never said anything about them complained Bill

I only saw them afterwards I was looking for the collar you remember
They came back to me afterwards I knew how Cayley would feel about
it Poor devil

Go on said Bill

Well then we had the inquest and of course I noticed and I suppose
you did too the curious fact that Robert had asked his way at the
second lodge and not at the first So I talked to Amos and Parsons That
made it more curious Amos told me that Robert had gone out of his way
to speak to him had called to him in fact Parsons told me that
his wife was out in their little garden at the first lodge all the
afternoon and was certain that Robert had never come past it He also
told me that Cayley had put him on to a job on the front lawn
that afternoon So I had another guess Robert had used the secret
passagethe passage which comes out into the park between the first and
second lodges Robert then had been in the house it was a putup job
between Robert and Cayley But how could Robert be there without Mark
knowing Obviously Mark knew too What did it all mean

When was this interrupted Bill Just after the inquestafter youd
seen Amos and Parsons of course

Yes I got up and left them and came to look for you Id got back to
the clothes then Why did Mark change his clothes so secretly Disguise
But then what about his face That was much more important than clothes
His face his beardhed have to shave off his beardand thenoh
idiot I saw you looking at that poster Mark acting Mark madeup Mark
disguised Oh priceless idiot Mark was Robert Matches please

Bill passed over the matches again waited till Antony had relit his
pipe and then held out his hand for them just as they were going into
the others pocket

Yes said Bill thoughtfully Yes But wait a moment What about
the Plough and Horses Antony looked comically at him

Youll never forgive me Bill he said Youll never come
cluehunting with me again

What do you mean

Antony sighed

It was a fake Watson I wanted you out of the way I wanted to be
alone Id guessed at my x and I wanted to test itto test it every
way by everything wed discovered I simply had to be alone just then
So he smiled and added Well I knew you wanted a drink

You are a devil said Bill staring at him And your interest when I
told you that a woman had been staying there

Well it was only polite to be interested when youd taken so much
trouble

You brute Youyou Sherlock And then you keep trying to steal my
matches Well go on

Thats all My x fitted

Did you guess Miss Norris and all that

Well not quite I didnt realize that Cayley had worked for it from
the beginninghad put Miss Norris up to frightening Mark I thought
hed just seized the opportunity

Bill was silent for a long time Then puffing at his pipe he said
slowly Has Cayley shot himself

Antony shrugged his shoulders

Poor devil said Bill It was decent of you to give him a chance Im
glad you did

I couldnt help liking Cayley in a kind of way you know

Hes a clever devil If you hadnt turned up just when you did he
would never have been found out

I wonder It was ingenious but its often the ingenious thing which
gets found out The awkward thing from Cayleys point of view was that
though Mark was missing neither he nor his body could ever be found
Well that doesnt often happen with a missing man He generally gets
discovered in the end a professional criminalperhaps notbut an
amateur like Mark He might have kept the secret of how he killed Mark
but I think it would have become obvious sooner or later that he had
killed him

Yes theres something in that Oh just tell me one thing Why did
Mark tell Miss Norbury about his imaginary brother

Thats puzzled me rather too Bill It may be that he was just doing
the Othello businesspainting himself black all over I mean he may
have been so full of his appearance as Robert that he had almost got to
believe in Robert and had to tell everybody More likely though he
felt that having told all of you at the house he had better tell Miss
Norbury in case she met one of you in which case if you mentioned the
approaching arrival of Robert she might say Oh Im certain he has
no brother he would have told me if he had and so spoil his joke
Possibly too Cayley put him on to it Cayley obviously wanted as many
people as possible to know about Robert

Are you going to tell the police

Yes I suppose theyll have to know Cayley may have left another
confession I hope he wont give me away you see Ive been a sort of
accessory since yesterday evening And I must go and see Miss Norbury

I asked explained Bill because I was wondering what I should say
toto Betty Miss Calladine You see shes bound to ask

Perhaps you wont see her again for a long long time said Antony
sadly

As a matter of fact I happen to know that she will be at the
Barringtons And I go up there tomorrow

Well you had better tell her Youre obviously longing to Only dont
let her say anything for a day or two Ill write to you

Righto

Antony knocked the ashes out of his pipe and got up

The Barringtons he said Large party

Fairly I think

Antony smiled at his friend

Yes Well if any of em should happen to be murdered you might send
for me Im just getting into the swing of it
