TOM SWIFT AND HIS GIANT CANNON



CHAPTER I

ON A LIVE WIRE


Now see here Mr Swift you may think it all a sort of dream and
imagine that I dont know what Im talking about but I do If youll
consent to finance this expedition to the extent of say ten thousand
dollars Ill practically guarantee to give you back five times that
sum

I dont know Alec I dont know slowly responded the aged inventor
Ive heard those stories before and in my experience nothing ever
came of them Buried treasure and lost vessels filled with gold are
all well and good but hunting for an opal mine on some littleheardof
island goes them one better

Then you dont feel like backing me up in this matter Mr Swift

No Alec I cant say I do Why just stop and think for a minute
Youre asking me to put ten thousand dollars into a company to fit out
an expedition to go to this islandsomewhere down near Panama you say
it isand try to locate the lost mine from which some centuries ago
opals and other precious stones came It doesnt seem reasonable

But Im sure I can find the mine Mr Swift persisted Alec Peterson
who was almost as elderly a man as the one he addressed I have the
old documents that tell how rich the mine once was how the old Mexican
rulers used to get their opals from it and how all trace of it was
lost in the last century I have all the landmarks down pat and Im
sure I can find it Come on now take a chance Put in this ten
thousand dollars I can manage the rest Youll get back more than five
times your investment

If you find the mineyes

I tell you I will find it Come now Mr Swift and the visitors
voice was very pleading you and your son Tom have made a fortune for
yourselves out of your different inventions Be generous and lend me
this ten thousand dollars

Mr Swift shook his head

Ive heard you talk the same way before Alec he replied None of
your schemes ever amounted to anything Youve been a fortunehunter
all your life nearly and what have you gotten out of it Just a bare
living

Thats right Mr Swift but Ive had bad luck I did find the lost
gold mine I went after some years ago you remember

Yes only to lose it because the missing heirs turned up and took it
away from you You could have made more at straight mining in the time
you spent on that scheme

Yes I suppose I could but this is going to be a successI feel it
in my bones

Thats what you say every time Alec No I dont believe I want to
go into this thing

Oh comedo For the sake of old times Dont you recall how you and
I used to prospect together out in the gold country how we shared our
failures and successes

Yes I remember that Alec Mighty few successes we had though in
those days

But now youve struck it rich pardner went on the pleader Help
me out in this schemedo

No Alec Id rather give you three or four thousand dollars for
yourself if youd settle down to some steady work instead of chasing
all over the country after visionary fortunes Youre getting too old
to do that

Well its a fact Im no longer young But Im afraid Im too old to
settle down You cant teach an old dog new tricks pardner This is my
life and Ill have to live it until I pass out Well if you wont
you wont I suppose By the way where is Tom Id like to see him
before I go back Hes a mighty fine boy

Thats what he is broke in a new voice Bless my overshoes but he
is a smart lad A wonderful lad thats what Why bless my necktie
there isnt anything he cant invent from a buttonhook to a
battleship Wonderful boythats what

I guess Toms ears would burn if he could hear your praises Mr
Damon laughed Mr Swift Dont spoil him

Spoil Tom Swift You couldnt do it in a hundred years cried Mr
Damon enthusiastically Bless my topknot Not in a thousand
yearsno sir

But where is he asked Mr Peterson who was evidently unused to the
extravagant manner of Mr Damon

There he goes now exclaimed the gentleman who frequently blessed
himself some article of his apparel or some other object There he
goes now flying over the house in that Humming Bird airship of his He
said he was going to try out a new magneto hed invented and it seems
to be working all right He said he wasnt going to take much of a
flight and I guess hell soon be back Look at him Isnt he a great
one though

He certainly is agreed Mr Peterson as he and Mr Swift went to the
window from which Mr Damon had caught a glimpse of the youthful
Inventor in his airship A great lad I wish he could come on this
minehunt with me though Id never consent to go in an airship
Theyre too risky for an old man like me

Theyre as safe as a church when Tom Swift runs them declared Mr
Damon Im no boy but Id go anywhere with Tom

Im afraid you wouldnt get Tom to go with you Alec went on Mr
Swift as he resumed his chair the young inventor in his airship
having passed out of sight Hes busy on some new invention now I
believe I think I heard him say something about a new rifle

Cannon it was Mr Swift said Mr Damon Tom has an idea that he
can make the biggest cannon in the world but its only an idea yet

Well then I guess theres no hope of my interesting him in my opal
mine said the fortunehunter with rather a disappointed smile Nor
you either Mr Swift

No Alec Im afraid not As I said Id rather give you outright
three or four thousand dollars if you wanted it provided that you
used it for your own personal needs and promised not to sink it in
some visionary search

Mr Peterson shook his head

Im not actually in want he said and I couldnt accept a gift of
money Mr Swift This is a straight business proposition

Not much straight business in hunting for a mine thats been lost for
over a century replied the aged inventor with a glance at Mr Damon
who was still at the window watching for a glimpse of Tom on his
return trip in the air craft

If Tom would go Id trail along said the odd man We havent done
anything worth speaking of since he used his great searchlight to
detect the smugglers But I dont believe hell go That mining
proposition sounds good

It is good cried Mr Peterson with fervor hoping he had found a
new prospect in Mr Damon

But not businessgood declared Mr Swift and for some time the
three argued the matter Mr Swift continuing to shake his head

Suddenly into the room there ran an aged colored man much excited

Fo de land sakes he cried Somebody oughter go out an help Massa
Tom

Why whats the matter Eradicate asked Mr Swift leaping to his
feet an example followed by the other two men What has happened to
my son

I dunno Massa Swift but I looked up jest now an dere he be in dat
aircontraption ob hisn he calls de Hummin Burd Hes ketched up
fast on de balloon shed roof an dere hes hangin wif sparks an
flames ashootin outer de airship suffin scandalous Its jest
spittin fire dats what its adoin an ef somebody dont do
suffin fo Massa Tom mighty quick dere aint gwin t be any Massa
Tom now dats what Ise atellin you

Bless my shoe buttons gasped Mr Damon Come on out everybody
Weve got to help Tom

Yes assented Mr Swift Call someone on the telephone Get a
doctor Maybe hes shocked Wheres Koku the giant Maybe he can help

Now doant yo go t gittin all excitedlaik objected Eradicate
Sampson the aged colored man Remember yo all has got a weak heart
Massa Swift

I know it but I must save my son Hurry

Mr Swift ran from the room followed by Mr Damon and Mr Peterson
while Eradicate trailed after them as fast as his tottering limbs would
carry him murmuring to himself

There he is cried Mr Damon as he caught sight of the young
inventor in his airship in a position of peril Truly it was as
Eradicate had said Caught on the slope of the roof of his big balloon
shed Tom Swift was in great danger

From his airship there shot dazzling sparks and streamers of green and
violet fire There was a snapping cracking sound that could be heard
above the whir of the crafts propellers for the motor was still
running

Oh Tom Tom What is it What has happened cried his father

Keep back Dont come too close yelled the young inventor as he
clung to the seat of the aeroplane that was tilted at a dangerous
angle Keep away

Whats the matter demanded Mr Damon Bless my pocket combwhat is
it

A live wire answered Tom Im caught in a live wire The trailer
attached to the wireless outfit on my airship is crossed with the wire
from the power plant Theres a short circuit somewhere Dont come too
close for it may burn through any second and drop down Then it will
twist about like a snake

Land ob massy cried Eradicate

What can we do to help you called Mr Swift Shall I run and shut
off the power for in the shop where Tom did most of his inventive
work there was a powerful dynamo and it was on one of the wires
extending from it that brought current into the house that the craft
had caught

Yes shut it off if you can Tom shouted back But be careful Dont
get shocked Wow I got a touch of it myself that time and he could
be seen to writhe in his seat

Oh hurry hurry Find Koku cried Mr Swift to Mr Damon who had
started for the power house on the run

The sparks and lances of fire seemed to increase around the young
inventor The airship could be seen to slip slowly down the sloping
roof

Land ob massy He am suah gwine t fall yelled Eradicate

Oh hell never get that current shut off in time murmured Mr
Swift as he started after Mr Damon

Wait I think I have a plan called Mr Peterson I think I can save
Tom

He did not waste further time in talk but running to a nearby shed
he got a long ladder that he saw standing under it With this over his
shoulder he retraced his steps to the balloon hangar and placed the
ladder against the side Then he started to climb up

What are you going to do yelled Tom leaning over from his seat to
watch the elderly fortunehunter

Im going to cut that wire was the answer

Dont If you touch it youll be shocked to death I may be able to
get out of here So far Ive only had light shocks but the insulation
is burning out of my magneto and that will soon stop When it does I
cant run the motor and

Im going to cut that wire again shouted Mr Peterson

But you cant without pliers and rubber gloves yelled Tom Keep
away I tell you

The man on the ladder hesitated Evidently he had not thought of the
necessity of protecting his hands by rubber covering in order that the
electricity might be made harmless He backed down to the ground

I saw a pair of old gloves in the shed he cried Ill get
themthey look like rubber

They are cried Tom remembering now that he had been putting up a
new wire that day and had left his rubber gloves there But you
havent any pliers the lad went How can you cut wire without them
Theres a pair in the shop but

Heah dey be Heah dey be cried Eradicate as he produced a heavy
pair from his pocket II couldnt find de canopener fo Mrs
Baggert an I jest got yo pliers Massa Tom Oh how glad I is dat I
did Heres de pincers Massa Peterson

He handed them to the fortunehunter who came running back with the
rubber gloves Mr Damon was no more than half way to the power house
which was quite a distance from the Swift homestead Meanwhile Toms
airship was slipping more and more and a thick pungent smoke now
surrounded it coming from the burning insulation The sparks and
electrical flames were worse than ever

Just a moment now and Ill have you safe cried the fortunehunter
as he again mounted the ladder Luckily the charged wire was near
enough to be reached by going nearly to the top of the ladder

Holding the pincers in his rubbergloved hands the old man quickly
snipped the wire There was a flash of sparks as the copper conductor
was severed and then the shower of sparks about Toms airship ceased

In another second he had turned on full power the propellers whizzed
with the quickness of light and he rose in the air off the shed roof
the live wire no longer entangling him Then he made a short circuit of
the workshop yard and came to the ground safely a little distance
from the balloon hangar

Saved Tom is saved cried Mr Swift who had seen the act of Mr
Peterson from a distance He saved my boys life

Thanks Mr Peterson exclaimed the young inventor as he left his
seat and walked up to the fortunehunter You certainly did me a good
turn then It was touch and go I couldnt have stayed there many
seconds longer Next time Ill know better than to fly with a wireless
trailer over a live conductor and he held out his hand to Mr
Peterson

Im glad I could help you Tom spoke the other warmly I was
afraid that if you had to wait until they shut off the power it would
be too late

It wouldit woulderI feelI

Toms voice trailed off into a whisper and he swayed on his feet

Cotch him cried Eradicate Cotch him Massa Toms hurt and only
just in time did Mr Peterson clutch the young inventor in his arms
For Tom white of face had fallen back in a dead faint




CHAPTER II

WELL TAKE A CHANCE


Carry him into the house cried Mr Swift as he came running to
where Mr Peterson was loosening Toms collar

Git a doctor murmured Eradicate Call someone on de tellifoam Git
fo doctors

We must get him into the house first declared Mr Damon who seeing
that Tom was off the shed roof had stopped midway to the powerhouse
and retraced his steps Lets carry him into the house Bless my
pocketbook but he must have been shocked worse than he thought

They lifted the inert form of our hero and walked toward the mansion
with him Mrs Baggert the housekeeper standing in the doorway in
dismay uncertain what to do

And while Tom is being cared for I will take just a moment to tell my
new readers something more about him and his inventions as they have
been related in the previous books of this series

The first volume was called Tom Swift and His MotorCycle and this
machine was the means of his becoming acquainted with Mr Wakefield
Damon the odd gentleman who so often blessed things On his
motorcycle Tom had many adventures

The lad was of an inventive mind as was his father and in the
succeeding books of the series which you will find named in detail
elsewhere I related how Tom got a motorboat made an airship and
later a submarine in all of which craft he had strenuous times and
adventures

His electric runabout was quite the fastest car on the road and when
he sent his wonderful wireless message he saved himself and others from
Earthquake Island He solved the secret of the diamond makers and
though he lost a fine balloon in the caves of ice he soon had another
air crafta regular skyracer His electric rifle saved a party from
the red pygmies in Elephant Land and in his air glider he found the
platinum treasure With his wizard camera Tom took wonderful moving
pictures and in the volume immediately preceding this present one
called Tom Swift and His Great Searchlight I had the pleasure of
telling you how the lad captured the smugglers who were working against
Uncle Sam over the border

Tom as you will see had with the help of his father perfected many
wonderful inventions The lad lived with his aged parent his mother
being dead in the village of Shopton in New York State

While the house which was presided over by the motherly Mrs Baggert
was large it was almost lost now amid the many buildings surrounding
it from balloon and airship hangars to shops where varied work was
carried on For Tom did most of his labor himself of course with men
to help him at the heavier tasks Occasionally he had to call on
outside shops

In the household beside his father himself and Mrs Baggert was
Eradicate Sampson an aged colored manofallwork who said he was
called Eradicate because he eradicated dirt There was also Koku a
veritable giant one of two brothers whom Tom had brought with him from
Giant Land when he escaped from captivity there as related in the
book of that name

Mr Damon was with Ned Newton Toms chum the warmest friend of the
family and was often at Toms home coming from the neighboring town
of Waterford where he lived

Tom had been back some time now from working for the government in
detecting the smugglers but as you may well suppose he had not been
idle Inventing a number of small things including useful articles for
the house was a sort of recreation for him but his mind was busy on
one great scheme which I will tell you about in due time

Among other things he had just perfected a new style of magneto for one
of his airships The magneto as you know is a sort of small dynamo
that supplies the necessary spark to the cylinder to explode the
mixture of air and gasoline vapor He was trying out this magneto in
the Humming Bird when the accident I have related in the first chapter
occurred

There Hes coming to exclaimed Mrs Baggert as she leaned over
Tom who was stretched out on the sofa in the library Give him
another smell of this ammonia she went on handing the bottle to Mr
Swift

Nono faintly murmured Tom opening his eyes IIve had enough
of that if you please Im all right

Are you sure Tom asked his father Arent you hurt anywhere

Not a bit Dad It was foolish of me to go off that way but I
couldnt seem to help it It all got black in front of me andwell I
just keeled over

I should say you did spoke Mr Peterson

An ef he hadnt abeen there to cotch yo all put in Eradicate
yo all suah would hab hit de ground mighty hard

Thats two services he did for me today said Tom as he managed to
sit up Cutting that wirewell it saved my life thats certain

I believe you Tom said Mr Swift solemnly and he held out his
hand to his old mining partner

Do you need the doctor asked Mr Damon who was at the telephone
He says hell come right overI can get him in Toms electric
runabout if you say so Hes on the wire now

No I dont need him replied the young inventor Thank him just the
same It was only an ordinary faint caused by the slight electrical
shocks and by getting a bit nervous I guess Im all rightsee
and he proved it by standing up

Hes all rightdont come doctor said Mr Damon into the
telephone Bless my keyring he exclaimed but that was a strenuous
time

Ive been in some tight places before went on Tom as he sat down in
an easy chair and Ive had any number of shocks when Ive been
experimenting but this was a sort of double combination and it sure
had me guessing But Im feeling better every minute

A cup of hot tea will do you good said motherly Mrs Baggert as she
bustled out of the room Ill make it for you

You cut that wire as neatly as any lineman could went on Tom
glancing from Mr Peterson out of the window to where one of his
workmen was repairing the break When I flew over it in my airship I
never gave a thought to the trailer from my wireless outfit The first
I knew I was caught back and then pulled down to the balloon shed
roof for I tilted the deflecting rudder by mistake

But Mr Peterson Tom went on I havent seen you in some time
Anything new on that brings you here for the fortunehunter had
called at the Swift house after Tom had gone out to the shop to get his
airship ready for the flight to try the magneto

Well Tom I have something rather new on replied Mr Peterson I
hoped to interest your father in it but he doesnt seem to care to
take a chance Its a lost opal mine on a littleknown island in the
Caribbean Sea not far from the city of Colon I say not farby that I
mean about twenty miles But your father doesnt want to invest say
ten thousand dollars in it though I can almost guarantee that hell
get five times that sum back So as long as he doesnt feel that he
can help me out I guess Id better be traveling on

Hold on Wait a minute Dont be in a hurry said Mr Swift

Mr Peterson was an old friend and when he and Mr Swift were young
men they had prospected and grubstaked together But Mr Swift soon
gave that up to devote his time to his inventions while Mr Peterson
became a sort of rolling stone

He was a good man but somewhat visionary and a bit inclined to take
chancessuch as looking for lost treasurerather than to devote
himself to some steady employment The result was that he led rather a
precarious life though never being actually in want

No pardner he said to Mr Swift Its kind of you to ask me to
stay but this mine business has got a grip on me I want to try it
out If you wont finance the project someone else may Ill say
goodbye and

Now just a minute said Mr Swift Its true Alec I had about made
up my mind not to go into this thing when this accident happened to
Tom Now you practically saved his life You

Oh pshaw I only acted on the spur of the moment Anyone could have
done what I did protested the fortunehunter

Oh but you did it insisted Mr Swift and you did it in the nick
of time Now I wouldnt for a moment think of offering you a reward for
saving my sons life But I do feel mighty friendly toward younot
that I didnt beforebut I do want to help you Alec I will go into
this business with you Well take a chance Ill invest ten thousand
dollars and Im not so awful worried about getting it back
eitherthough I dont believe in throwing money away

You wont throw it away in this case declared Mr Peterson eagerly
Im sure to find that mine but it will take a little capital to work
it Thats what I needcapital

Well Ill supply it to the extent of ten thousand dollars said Mr
Swift Tom what do you think of it Am I foolish or not

Not a bit of it Dad cried the young man who was now himself again
Im glad you took that chance for if you hadntwell I would have
supplied the money myselfthats all and he smiled at the
fortunehunter




CHAPTER III

PLANNING A BIG GUN


BUT Tom I dont see how in the world you can ever hope to make a
bigger gun than that

I think it can be done Ned was the quiet answer of the young
inventor He looked up from some drawings on the table in the office of
one of his shops Now Ill just show you

Hold on Tom You know I have a very poor head for figures even if I
do help you out once in a while on some of your work Skip the
technical details and give me the main facts

The two young menNed Newton being Toms special chumwere talking
together over Toms latest scheme

It was several days after Toms accident in the airship when he had
been saved by the prompt action of Mr Peterson That fortunehunter
once he had the promise of Mr Swift to invest in his somewhat
visionary plan of locating a lost opal mine near the Panama Canal had
left the Swift homestead to arrange for fitting out the expedition of
discovery He had tried to prevail on Tom to accompany him and
failing in that tried to work on Mr Damon

Bless my watch chain exclaimed that odd gentleman I would like to
go with you first rate But Im so busyso very busythat I cant
think of it I have simply neglected all my affairs chasing around the
country with Tom Swift But if Tom goes Iahem I think perhaps I
could manage itahem

I thought you were busy laughed Tom

Oh well perhaps I could get a few weeks off But Im not goingno
bless my check book I must get back to business

But as Mr Damon was a retired gentleman of wealth his business was
more or less of a joke among his friends

So then a few days after the departure of Mr Peterson Tom and Ned
sat in the formers office discussing the young inventors latest
scheme

How big is the biggest gun ever made Tom asked his chum I mean in
feet in inches or in muzzle diameter however they are measured

Well began Tom of course some nation may in secret be making a
bigger gun than any I have ever heard of As far as I know however
the largest one ever made for the United States was a sixteeninch
rifled cannonthat is it was sixteen inches across at the muzzle and
I forget just how long It weighed many tons however and it now lies
or did a few years ago in a ditch at the Sandy Hook proving grounds
It was a failure

And yet you are figuring on making a cannon with a muzzle thirty
inches acrossalmost a yardand fifty feet long and to weigh

No one can tell exactly how much it will weigh interrupted Tom And
Im not altogether certain about the muzzle measurement nor of the
length Its sort of in the air at present Only I dont see why a
larger gun than any that has yet been made cant be constructed

If anybody can invent one you can Tom Swift exclaimed Ned
admiringly

You flatter me exclaimed his chum with a mock bow

But what good will it be went on Ned Making big guns doesnt help
any in war that I can see

Ned exclaimed Tom you dont look far enough ahead Now heres my
scheme in a nutshell You know what Uncle Sam is doing down in his big
ditch dont you

You mean digging the Panama Canal

Yes the greatest engineering feat of centuries It is going to make a
big change in the whole world and the United States is going to
becomeif she is not alreadya worldpower Now that canal has to be
protectedI mean against the possibility of war For though it may
never come and the chances are it never will still it may

Uncle Sam has to be ready for it There never was a more true saying
than in time of peace prepare for war Preparing for war is in my
opinion the best way not to have one

Once the Panama Canal is in operation and the worldchanges
incidental to it have been made if it should pass into the hands of
some foreign countryas it very possibly might dothe United States
would not only be the laughingstock of the world but she would lose
the high place she holds

Now then to protect the canal several things are necessary Among
them are big gunscannon that can shoot a long distancefor if a
foreign nation should send some of their new dreadnaughts over
herevessels with guns that can shoot many mileswhere would the
canal be once a bombardment was opened It would be ruined in a
daythe immense lockgates would be destroyed And not only from the
guns aboard ships would there be danger but from siege cannon planted
in Costa Rica or some South American country below the canal zone

Now to protect the canal against such an attack we need guns that can
shoot farther straighter and more powerfully than any at present in
use and weve got to have the most powerful explosive In other words
weve got to beat the biggest guns that are now in existence And Im
going to do it Ned

You are

Yes Im going to invent a cannon that will make the longest shots on
record Im going to make a worldbeater gun or rather Im going to
invent it and have it made for I guess it would tax this place to the
limit

Ive been thinking of this for some time Ned Ive been puttering
around inventing new magnetos potatoparers and the like but this is
my latest hobby The Panama Canal is a big thingone of the biggest
things in the world We need the biggest guns in the world to protect
it

And listen Uncle Sam thinks the same way I understand that the best
men in the serviceat West Point Annapolis and Sandy Hook as well as
elsewhereare working in the interest of the United States to perfect
a bigger cannon than any ever before made In fact one has just been
constructed and is going to be tried at the Sandy Hook proving grounds
soon Im going to see the test if I can

And heres another thing Foreign nations are trying to steal Uncle
Sams secrets If this country gets a big cannon some other nation
will want a bigger one Its a constant warfare Im going to devote my
talentssuch as they areto Uncle Sam Im going to make the biggest
cannon in the worldthe one that will shoot the farthest and knock
into smithereens all the other big guns Thats the only way to protect
the canal Do you understand Ned

Somewhat Tom Since I gave up my place in the bank and became a sort
of handylad for you I know more about your work But isnt it going
to be dangerous to make a cannon like that

Well in a way yes Ned But weve got to take chances just as
father did when he invested ten thousand dollars in that opal mine
Hell never see his money again

Dont you think so

No Ned

And when do you expect to start on your gun Tom

Right away Im making some plans now Im going down to Sandy Hook
and witness the test of this new big cannon You can come along if you
like

Well I sure will like When is it

Oh in about a week Ill have to look

Scuse me Massa Tom broke in Eradicate as he put his head through
the halfopened office door Scuse me but deres a express genmen
outside wif his auto truck an hes got some packages fo yo all
marked dangerousexplosivean keep away fom de fire He want t
know what he all gwine t do wif em Massa Tom

Do with em Oh I guess its that new giant powder I sent for Why
Eradicate have him bring em right in here

Yais sah Massa Tom Dats all right but he jest cant bring em
in and Eradicate looked behind him somewhat apprehensively

Cant bring em in Why not Id like to know exclaimed Tom Hes
paid for it

Scuse me Massa Tom said the colored man but dat express genmen
cant bring dem explosive powder boxes in heah case as how his
autermobile hab done ketched fire an he caint get near it nohow
Dats why Massa Tom

Caesars ghost yelled the young inventor The auto on fire and
that powder in it Come on Ned and he made a rush for the door




CHAPTER IV

KOKUS BRAVE ACT


Tom Tom cried Ned as he watched the disappearing figure of his
chum Come back here If theres going to be an explosion we ought to
run out of the back door

Im not running away flashed back Tom Im going to get that powder
out of the auto before it goes up If it does well be blown to kingdom
come back door or front door Come on

Bacon and eggs yelled Ned Hes running an awful risk But I cant
let him go alone I guess were in for it

Then he too rushed from the office toward the front of the shop
before which in a sort of private road stood the blazing auto And
Ned who had now lost sight of Tom because of our hero having turned a
corner in the corridor heard excited shouts coming from the seat of
trouble

If thats some new kind of powder Toms sent for to test for his new
big gun and it goes up Ned said to himself as he rushed on this
place will be blown to smithereens All Toms valuable machinery and
patents will be ruined

Ned had now reached the front door of the shop He had a glimpse of the
burning autoa small express truck well loaded with various packages
And through the smoke which from the odor must have been caused by
burning gasoline Ned could see several boxes marked in red letters


DANGEROUS EXPLOSIVE


 KEEP AWAY FROM FIRE


Keep away from fire murmured the panting lad If they can get any
nearer fire I dont see how

Oh mah golly gasped Eradicate who had lumbered on behind Ned Oh
mah golly Oh good land ob massy Look at Massa Tom

Ive got to help him cried Ned for he saw that his chum had rushed
to the rear of the auto and was endeavoring to drag one of the powder
boxes across the lowered tailboard Tom was straining and tugging at
it but did not seem able to move the case It was heavy as Ned
learned later and was also held down by the weight of other express
packages on top of it

Oh mah golly cried Eradicate Git some watah somebody an put
out dat fire

Nono water yelled Tom who heard him Water will only make it
worseitll scatter the blazing gasoline The feed pipe from the tank
must have burst Throw on sandsand is the only thing to use

Ill git a shubble cried Eradicate Ill git a sandshubble and
he tottered off

Wait Tom Ill give you a hand cried Ned as he saw his chum step
away from the end of the auto for a moment as a burst of flame and
choking smoke driven by the wind was blown almost in his face Ill
help you

Weve got to be lively then Ned gasped Tom This is getting
hotter every minute Wheres that Koku He could yank these boxes out
in a jiffy

And indeed a giants strength was needed at that moment

Ned glanced around to see if he could catch a glimpse of the big man
whom Tom had brought from Giant Land but Koku was not in sight

Lets have another try now Ned suggested Tom when a shift in the
wind left the rear of the auto comparatively free from smoke and flame

You fellows had better skip cried the expressman who had been
throwing light packages off his vehicle from in front where as yet
there was no fire That powderll go up in another minute Some of the
boxes are beginning to catch now he yelled Look out

Thats right shouted Tom as he saw that the edge of one of the
wooden cases containing the powder was blazing slightly Lively Ned

Ned held back only for a second Then realizing that the time to act
was now or never and that even if he ran he could hardly save himself
he advanced to Toms side The smoke was choking and stifling them and
the flames coming from beneath the auto truck made them gasp for
breath

Together Tom and Ned tugged at the nearest case of powderthe one that
was ablaze

Wewe cant budge it panted Tom

Itits caught somewhere added Ned Oh if Koku were only here

There was a sound behind the lads A voice exclaimed

Master want shovel so Eradicate sayhere it is

They turned and saw a big powerful man with a simple childlike
face standing calmly looking at the burning auto

Koku cried Tom Quick Never mind the shovel Get those powder
boxes out of that cart before they go up Yank em out Theyre too
much for Ned and me Quick

Oh of a courseness I will so do said Koku to whom even yet the
English language was somewhat of a mystery He dropped the shovel and
heedless of the thick smoke from the burning gasoline reached over and
took hold of the nearest box It seemed as though he pulled it from the
auto truck as easily as Tom might have lifted a cork

Then carrying the box which was now burning quite fiercely on one
corner over toward Tom and Ned who had moved back the giant asked

What you want of him Master

Put it down Koku and get out all the others Lively now Koku

I do was the simple answer The giant put the box on the grass and
ran back toward the auto

Quick Ned shouted Tom Throw some sand on this burning box That
will put out the fire

A few handfuls of earth served to extinguish the little blaze and by
this time Koku had come back with another box of powder

Get em all Koku get em all Then we can put out the fire on the
auto

For the giant it was but childs play to carry the heavy boxes of
powder and soon he had them all removed from the truck Then with the
danger thus narrowly averted they all including the expressman
turned in and began throwing sand on the fire which now had a good
hold on the body of the auto The shovel which Eradicate had sent by
Koku who could use more speed than could the aged colored man came in
handy

Soon the fire was out though not before the truck had been badly
damaged and some of its load destroyed But beyond a charring of some
of the powder boxes the explosive was intact

Whew That was a lucky escape murmured Tom as he sat down on one of
the boxes and wiped the smoke and sweat from his face A little
later and thered only been a hole in the ground to tell what happened
Hot work eh Ned

I guess yes Tom

I thought of the powder as soon as I saw that the truck was on fire
explained the expressman but I didnt know what to do I was kinder
flustered I guess This is the second time this old truck has caught
fire from a leaky gasoline pipe I guess that will be the lastit will
for me anyhow Ill resign if they dont give me another machine Will
you sign for your stuff he asked Tom holding out the receipt book
which had escaped the flames

Yes and Im mighty glad Im here to sign for it replied the young
inventor Now Koku I guess you can take that stuff up to the shop
but be careful where you put it

I do Master replied the giant

What sort of powder is that Tom asked Ned a little later when they
were again back in the office the excitement having calmed down The
expressman had gone back to town afoot to arrange about getting
another vehicle for what remained of his load Is it the kind they use
in big guns

One of the kinds replied Tom I sent for several samples and this
is one Im going to conduct some tests to see what kind Ill need for
my own big gun But I expect Ill have to invent an explosive as well
as a cannon for I want the most powerful I can get Want to look at
some of this powder

Yes if you think its safe

Oh its safe enough if you treat it right Ill show you and
working carefully Tom soon had one of the boxes open Reaching into
the depths he held up a handful of something that looked like sticks of
macaroni There it is he said

That powder cried Ned Thats a queer kind Ive seen the kind they
use in some guns on the battleships That powder was in hexagonal form
about two inches across and had a hole in the centre It was colored
brown

Well powder is made in many forms explained Tom A person who has
only seen black gunpowder with its little grains would not believe
that this was one grain of the new powder

That macaroni stick a grain of powder cried Ned

Yes well call it a grain went on the young inventor just as the
brown hexagonal cube you saw was a grain You see Ned the idea is to
explode all the powder at onceto get instantaneous action It must
all burn up at once as soon as it is detonated or set off

To do that you have to have every grain acted on at the same moment
and that could not be done if the powder was in one solid chunk or
closely packed For that reason they make it in different shapes so it
will lie loose in the firing chamber just as a lot of jackstraws are
piled up In fact some of the new powder looks like jackstraws Some
as this for instance looks like macaroni Other is in cubes and some
in long strings

As he spoke Tom struck a match and held the flames near the end of one
of the macaroni sticks

Caesars grandmother yelled Ned Are you crazy Tom as he started
to leap for a window

Dont get excited spoke Tom quietly Theres no danger and he
actually set fire to the stick of queer powder which burned like some
wax taper

Butbut stammered Ned

It is only when powder is confined that it explodes Tom explained
If it can burn in the open its as harmless as water provided you
dont burn too much at once But put it in something where the
resulting gases accumulate and cant escape and thenwhy you have an
explosionthats all

Yesthats all remarked Ned grimly as he nervously watched the
burning stick of powder Tom let it flame for a few seconds and then
calmly blew it out

You know what a little puff black gunpowder gives if you burn some
openly on the ground went on Tom dont you Ned

Sure Ive often done that

But put that same powder in a tight box and set fire to it and you
have a bang instead of a puff Its the same way with this powder only
it doesnt even puff for it burns more slowly

An explosion you see is the sudden liberation at one time of the
gases which result when the powder is burned If the gases are given
off gradually and in the open no harm is done But put a stick like
this in say a steel box all closed up save a hole for the fuse and
what do you have An explosion Thats the principle of all guns and
cannon

But say Ned Im getting to be a regular lecturer I didnt know I
was running on so Why didnt you stop me

Because I was interested Go on tell me some more

Not now I want to get this powder in a safe place Im a little
nervous about it after that fire You see if it had caught when
tightly packed in the boxes there would have been a terrific
explosion though it does burn so harmlessly in the open air Now let
me see

Tom was interrupted by the postmans whistle and a little later
Eradicate came in with the mail that had been left in the box at the
shop door Tom rapidly looked over the letters

Heres the note I want I think he said Selecting one Yes this
is it Permission is hereby granted he read to Thomas Swift to
visit and so on and so on This is the stuff Ned he cried

What is it

A permit to visit the government proving grounds at Sandy Hook Ned
and see em test that new big gun I was telling you about Hurray
Well go down there and Ill see how my ideas fit in with those of the
governments experts

Did you say we would go down Tom

I sure did Youll go with me wont you

Well I hadnt thought very much about it but I guess I will When
is it

A week from today and Im going to need all that time to get ready
Now lets get busy and well arrange to go to Sandy Hook Ive had
trouble enough to get this permitI guess Ill put it where it wont
get lost and he locked it in a secret drawer of his desk

Then the lads stored the powder in a safe place and soon were busy
about several matters in the shop




CHAPTER V

OFF TO SANDY HOOK


Whats the idea of this government test of the big gun Tom asked
Ned I got so excited about that nearexplosion the other day that I
didnt think to ask you all the particulars

Why the idea is to see if the gun will work and do all that the
inventor claims for it was the answer They always put a new gun
through more severe tests than anything it will be called on to stand
in actual warfare They want to see just how much margin of safety
there is

Oh I see And is this one of the guns that are to be used in
fortifying the Panama Canal

Well Ned I dont know exactly You see the government isnt
telling all its secrets I assume that it is and thats why Im
anxious to see what sort of a gun it is

As a matter of fact Im going into this thing on a sort of chance
just as dad did when he invested in Mr Petersons opal mine

Do you think anything will come of that Tom

I dont know If we get down to Panama after I have made my big gun
we may take a run over and see how he is making out But as I said
Im going into this big cannon business on a sort of gamble I have
heard indirectly that Uncle Sam intends to use a new type of gun in
fortifying the Panama Canal Its about fortynine miles long you
know and it will take many guns to cover the whole route as well as
to protect the two entrances

Not so very many if you make a gun that will shoot thirty miles
remarked Ned with a smile

Im not so sure I can do it went on Tom But even at that quite a
number of guns will be needed For if any foreign nation or any
combination of nations intend to get the canal away from us they
wont make the attack from one point Theyll come at us seven
different ways for Sunday and Ive never heard yet of a gun that can
shoot seven ways at once Thats why so many will be needed

But as I said I dont know just what type the Ordnance Department
will favor and I want to get a line Then even if I invent a cannon
that will outshoot all the others they may not take mine Though if
they do and buy a number of them Ill be more than repaid for my
labor besides having the satisfaction of helping my country

Good for you Tom I wish it was time to go to Sandy Hook now Im
anxious to see that big gun Do you know anything about it

Not very much I have heard that it is not quite as large as the old
sixteeninch rifle that they had to throw away because of some trouble
I dont know just what It was impractical in spite of its size and
great range But this new gun they are going to test is considerably
smaller I understand

It was invented by a General Waller and is I think about twelve
inches across at the muzzle In spite of that comparatively small size
it fires a projectile weighing a thousand pounds or half a ton and
takes five hundred pounds of powder Its range of course no one knows
yet though I have heard it said that General Waller claims it will
shoot twenty miles

Whew Some shot

Im going to beat it declared Tom and I want to do it without
making such a monstrous gun that it will be difficult to cast it

You see Ned there is theoretically nothing to prevent the casting
of a steel rifled cannon that would be fifty inches across at the
muzzle and making it a hundred feet long I mean it could be done on
paperfigured out and all that But whether you would get a
corresponding increase in power or range and be able to throw a
relatively larger projectile is something no one knows for there
never has been such a gun made Besides the strain of the big charge
of powder needed would be enormous So I dont want merely to make a
giant cannon I want one that will do a giants work and still be
somewhere in the middlesized class

I see Well youll probably get some points at Sandy Hook

I think so We go day after tomorrow

Is Mr Damon going

I think not If he does Ill have to get another pass for mine only
calls for two persons I got it through a Captain Badger a friend of
mine stationed at the Sandy Hook barracks He doesnt have anything
to do with the coast defense guns but he got the pass to the proving
grounds for me

Tom and his chum talked for some time about the prospects for making a
giant cannon and then the young inventor with Neds aid made some
powder tests using some of the explosive that had so nearly caught
fire

It isnt just what I want Tom decided after he had put small
quantities in little steel bombs and exploded them at a safe
distance and under a bank of earth by means of an electric primer

Why Tom that powder certainly burst the bombs all to pieces said
Ned picking up a shattered piece of steel

I know but it isnt powerful enough for me Im going to send for
samples of another kind and if I cant get what I want Ill make my
own powder But come on now this stuff gives me a headache Lets take
a little flight in the Humming Bird Well go see Mr Damon and soon
the two lads were in the speedy little monoplane skimming along like
the birds The fresh air soon blew away their headaches caused by the
fumes from the nitroglycerine which was the basis of the powder
Dynamite will often produce a headache in those who work with it

Two days later Tom and Ned set off for Sandy Hook

This long necklike strip of land on the New Jersey coast is as most
of you know one of the principal defenses of our country

Foreign vessels that steam into New York harbor first have to pass the
line of terrible guns that back of the earth and concrete defenses
look frowningly out to sea It is a wonderful place

On the Sandy Hook Bay side of the Hook there is a lifesaving station
Right across on the sea side are the big guns Between are the
barracks where the soldiers live and part of the land is given over to
a proving ground where many of the big guns are taken to be tested

Tom and Ned reached New York City without incident of moment and
after a night spent at a hotel they went to the Battery whence the
small government steamer leaves every day for Sandy Hook It is a trip
of twentyone miles and as the bay was rather rough that day Tom and
Ned had a taste of a real sea voyage But they were too experienced
travelers to mind that though some other visitors were made quite ill

A landing was made on the bay side of the Hook it being too rough to
permit of a dock being constructed on the ocean side

Now well see what luck we have spoke Tom as he and Ned inquiring
the way to the proving grounds from a soldier on duty started for
them On the way they passed some of the fortifications

Look at that gun exclaimed Ned pointing to a big cannon which
seemed to be crouched down in a sort of concrete pit How can they
fire that Tom The muzzle points directly at the stone wall Does the
wall open when they want to fire

No the gun raises up peeps over the wall so speak shoots out its
projectile and then crouches down again

Oh you mean a disappearing gun

Thats it Ned See it works by compressed air and Tom showed his
chum how when the gun was loaded the projectile in place and the
breechblock screwed fast the officer in charge of the firing squad
would on getting the range from the soldier detailed to calculate it
make the necessary adjustments and pull the lever

The compressed air would fill the cylinders forcing the gun to rise on
togglejointed arms so that the muzzle was above the bombproof wall
Then it would be fired and sink back again out of sight of the enemy

The boys looked at several different types of big rifled cannon and
then passed on They could hear firing in the distance some of the
explosions shaking the ground

Theyre making some tests now said Tom hurrying forward

Ned followed until passing a sort of machine shop the lads came to
where a sentry paced up and down a concrete walk

Are these the proving grounds asked Tom This is the entrance to
them replied the soldier bringing his rifle to port according to
the regulations What do you want

To go in and watch the gun tests replied Tom I have a permit and
he held it out so the soldier could see it

That permit is no good here the sentry exclaimed

No good faltered Tom

No it has to be countersigned by General Waller And as hes on the
proving grounds now you cant see him Hes getting ready for the test
of his new cannon

But thats just what we want to see cried Tom We want to get in
there purposely for that Cant you send word to General Waller

I cant leave my post replied the sentry shortly Youll have to
come another time when the General isnt busy You cant get in unless
he countersigns that permit

Then it may be too late to witness the test objected the young
inventor Isnt there some way I can get word to him

I dont think so replied the sentry And Ill have to ask you to
leave this vicinity No strangers are allowed on the proving grounds
without a proper pass




CHAPTER VI

TESTING THE WALLER GUN


Tom looked at Ned in dismay After all their work and planning to be
thus thwarted and by a mere technicality As they stood there hardly
knowing what to do the sound of a tremendous explosion came to their
ears from behind the big pile of earth and concrete that formed the
bombproof around the testing ground

Whats that cried Ned as the earth shook

Just trying some of the big guns explained the sentry who was not a
badnatured chap He had to do his duty Youd better move on he
suggested If anything happens the government isnt responsible you
know

I wish there was some way of getting in there murmured Tom

You can see General Waller after the test and he will probably
countersign the permit explained the sentry

And we wont see the test of the gun Im most interested in objected
Tom If I could only

He stopped as he noticed the sentry salute someone coming up from the
rear Tom and Ned turned to behold a pleasantfaced officer who at
the sight of the young inventor exclaimed

Well well If it isnt my old friend Tom Swift So you got here on my
permit after all

Yes Captain Badger replied the lad and then with a rueful face he
added But it doesnt seem to be doing me much good I cant get into
the proving grounds

You cant Why not and he looked sharply at the sentry

Very sorry sir spoke the man on guard but General Waller has left
orders Captain Badger that no outsiders can enter the proving grounds
when his new gun is being tested unless he countersigns the permits
And hes engaged just now Im sorry but

Oh thats all right Flynn said Captain Badger It isnt your
fault of course I suppose there is no rule against my going in
there and he smiled

Certainly not sir Any officer may go in and the guard stepped to
one side

Let me have that pass Tom and wait here for me said the Captain
Ill see what I can do for you and the young officer whose
acquaintance Tom had made at the tests when the government was
purchasing some aeroplanes for the army hurried off

He came back presently and by his face the lads knew he had been
successful

Its all right he said with a smile General Waller countersigned
the pass without even looking at it Hes so excited over the coming
test of his gun that he hardly knows what he is doing Come on in
boys Ill go with you

Then they havent tested his gun yet Asked Tom eagerly anxious to
know whether he had missed anything

No theyre going to do so in about half an hour Youll have time to
look around a bit Come on and showing the sentinel the
countersigned pass Captain Badger led the two youths into the proving
grounds

Tom and Ned saw so much to interest them that they did not know at
which to look first In some places officers and firing squads were
testing smallcalibre machine guns which shot off a round with a noise
like a string of firecrackers on the Chinese New Years On other
barbettes larger guns were being tested the noise being almost
deafening

Stand on your tiptoes and open your mouth when you see a big cannon
about to be fired advised Captain Badger as he walked alongside the
boys

What good does that do inquired Ned

It makes your contact with the earth as small as possiblestanding on
your toes the officer explained and so reduces the tremor Opening
your mouth in a measure equalizes the changed air pressure caused by
the vacuum made when the powder explodes In other words you get the
same sort of pressure down inside your throat and in the tubes leading
to the earthe same pressure inside as outside

Often the firing of big guns will burst the ear drums of the officers
near the cannon and this may often be prevented by opening the mouth
Its just like going through a deep tunnel or sometimes when an
elevator descends quickly from a great height There is too much
outside air pressure on the ear drums By opening your mouth and
swallowing rapidly the pressure is nearly equaled and you feel no
discomfort

The boys tried this when the next big gun was fired and they found it
true They noticed quite a crowd of officers and men about a certain
large barbette and Captain Badger led them in that direction

Is that General Wallers gun asked Tom

Thats where they are going to test it was the answer

Eagerly Tom and Ned pressed forward No one of the many officers and
soldiers grouped about the new cannon seemed to notice them A tall
man who seemed very nervous and excited was hurrying here and there
giving orders rapidly

How is that range now he asked Let me take a look Are you sure
the patrol vessels are far enough out I think this projectile is going
farther than any of you gentlemen have calculated

I believe we have correctly estimated the distance answered someone
and the two entered into a discussion

That excited officer is General Waller explained Captain Badger in
a low voice to Tom and Ned

I guessed as much replied the young inventor Then he went closer to
get a better look at the big cannon

I say big cannon and yet it was not the largest the government had In
fact Tom estimated the calibre to be less than twelve inches but the
cannon was very longmuch longer in proportion than guns of greater
muzzle diameter Then too the breech or rear part was very thick
and heavy

He must be going to use a tremendous lot of powder said Tom

He is answered Captain Badger Some of us think he is going to use
too much but he says it is impossible to burst his gun He wants to
make a longrange record shot and maybe he will

Thats a new kind of breech block commented Tom as he watched the
mechanism being operated

Yes thats General Wallers patent too Theyre going to fire soon

I might explain briefly for the benefit of you boys who have never
seen a big modern cannon that it consists of a central core of cast
steel This is rifled just as a small rifle is bored with twisted
grooves throughout its length The grooves or rifling impart a
twisting motion to the projectiles and keep them in a straighter line

After the central core is made and rifled thick jackets of steel are
shrunk on over the rear part of the gun Sometimes several jackets
are put on one over the other to make the gun stronger

If you have ever seen a blacksmith put a tire on a wheel you will
understand what I mean The tire is heated and this expands it or
makes it larger It is put on hot and when it cools it shrinks
getting smaller and gripping the rim of the wheel in a strong embrace
That is what the jackets of steel do to the big guns

A big rifled cannon is loaded from the rear or breech just as is a
breechloading shotgun or rifle That is the cannon is opened at the
back and the projectile is put in by means of a derrick for often the
projectiles weigh a thousand pounds or more Next comes the
powderhundreds of pounds of itand then it is necessary to close the
breech

The breech block does this That block is a ponderous piece of steel
quite complicated and it swings on a hinge fastened to one side of the
rear of the gun Once it is swung back into place it is made fast by
means of screw threads wedges or in whatever way the inventor of the
gun deems best

The breech block must be very strong and held firmly in place or the
terrific force of the powder would blow it out wreck the gun and kill
those behind it You see the breech block really stands a great part
of the strain The powder is between it and the projectile and there
is a sort of warfare to see which will give waythe projectile or the
block In most cases the projectile gracefully bows so to speak and
skips out of the muzzle of the gun though sometimes the big breech
block will be shattered

With eager eyes Tom and Ned watched the preparations for firing the big
gun The charge of powder was hoisted out of the bombproof chamber
below the barbette and then the great projectile was brought up in
slings At the sight of that Tom realized that the gun was no ordinary
one for the great piece of steel was nearly three feet long and must
have weighed nearly a thousand pounds Truly much powder would be
needed to send that on its way

Im afraid General that you are using too much of that strong
powder Tom heard one officer say to the inventor of the gun It may
burst the breech

Nonsense Colonel Washburn I tell you it is impossible to burst my
gunimpossible sir I have allowed for every emergency and
calculated every strain I have a margin of safety equal to fifty per
cent

Very well I hope it proves a success

Of course it will It is impossible to burst my gun Now are we ready
for the test

The gun was rather crude in form not having received its final polish
and it was mounted on a temporary carriage But even with that Tom
could see that it was a wonderful weapon though he thought he would
have put on another jacket toward the muzzle to further strengthen
that portion

Im going to make a gun bigger than that said Tom to Ned He spoke
rather louder than he intended and as it was at a moment when there
was a period of silence the words carried to General Waller who was
at that moment near Tom

Whats that inquired the rather fierytempered officer as he looked
sharply at our hero

I said I was going to make a larger gun than that repeated Tom
modestly

Sir Do you know what you are saying How did you come in here
anyhow I thought no civilians were to be admitted today Explain how
you got here

Tom felt an angry flush mounting to his cheeks

I came in here on a pass countersigned by you he replied

A pass countersigned by me Let me see it

Tom passed it over

Humph it doesnt seem to be forged went on the pompous officer
Who are you anyhow

Tom Swift

Hum

General Waller permit me to introduce Tom Swift to you spoke
Captain Badger stepping forward and trying not to smile He is one
of our foremost inventors It is his type of monoplane that the
government has adopted for the coming maneuvers at Panama you may
recall and he was very helpful to Uncle Sam in stopping that swindling
on the border last yearTom and his big searchlight Mr Swift
General Waller and Captain Badger bowed as he completed the
introduction

Whats that Tom Swift here Let me meet him exclaimed an elderly
officer coming through the crowd The others parted to make way for
him as he seemed to be a person of some importance to judge by his
uniform and the medals he wore

Tom Swift here he went on I want to shake hands with you Tom I
havent seen you since I negotiated with you for the purchase of those
submarines you invented and which have done such splendid service for
the government Tom Im glad to see you here today

The face of General Waller was a study in blank amazement




CHAPTER VII

THE IMPOSSIBLE OCCURS


There were murmurs throughout the throng about the big gun as the
officer approached Tom Swift and shook hands with him

What have you in mind now Tom that you come to Sandy Hook the
muchmedaled officer asked

Nothing much Admiral answered our hero

Oh yes you have returned Admiral Woodburn head of the naval
forces of Uncle Sam Youve got some idea in your head or you
wouldnt come to see this test of my friends gun Well if you can
invent anything as good for coast defense or even interior defense as
your submarines it will be in keeping with what you have done in the
past I congratulate you General Waller on having Tom Swift here to
give you the benefit of some of his ideas

II havent had the pleasure of meeting Mr Swift before said the
gun inventor stiffly I did not recognize his name when I
countersigned his pass

It was plain that the greeting of Tom by Admiral Woodburn had had a
marked effect in changing sentiment toward our hero Captain Badger
smiled as he noticed with what different eyes the gun inventor now
regarded the lad

Well if Tom Swift gives you any points about your gun you want to
adopt them went on the Admiral I thought I knew something about
submarines but Tom taught me some things too didnt you Tom

Oh it was just a simple matter Admiral said Tom modestly Just
that little point about the intake valves and the ballast tanks

But they changed the whole matter Yes General you take Toms
adviceif he gives you any

I dont know that I will need anyas yet replied General Waller I
am confident my gun will be a success as it is at present constructed
Later however if I should decide to make any changes I will gladly
avail myself of Mr Swifts counsel and he bowed stiffly to Tom We
will now proceed with the test he went on Kindly send a wireless to
the patrol ships that we are about to fire and ask them to note
carefully where the projectile falls

Very good sir spoke the officer in immediate charge of the matter
as he saluted Soon from the aerials snapped the vicious sparks that
told of the wireless telegraph being worked

I might explain that near the spot where the projectile was expected to
fall into the seaabout fifteen miles from Sandy Hookseveral war
vessels were stationed to warn shipping to give the place a wide berth
This was easy since the big gun had been aimed at a spot outside of
the steamship lanes Aiming the rifle in a certain direction and
giving it a definite angle of inclination made it practically certain
just where the shot would fall This is called getting the range and
while of course the exact limit of fire of the new gun was not known
it had been computed as nearly as possible

Is everything ready now asked General Waller while Tom was
conversing with his friends Captain Badger and Admiral Woodburn Ned
taking part in the conversation from time to time

All ready sir was the assurance The inventor was plainly nervous
as the crucial moment of the test approached He went here and there
upon the barbette testing the various levers and gear wheels of the
gun

The projectile and powder had been put in the breechblock screwed
into place the primer had been inserted and all that remained was to
press the button that would make the electrical connection and explode
the charge This act of firing the gun had been intrusted to one of the
soldiers for General Waller and his brother officers were to retire to
a bombproof whence they would watch the effect of the fire and note
the course of the projectile

It seems to me remarked Ned that the soldier who is going to fire
the gun is in the most danger

He would beif it exploded spoke Tom for his officer friends had
joined their colleagues most of whom were now walking toward the
shelter But I think there is little danger

You see the electric wires are long enough to enable him to stand
some distance from the gun And if he likes he can crouch behind that
concrete wall of the next barbette Still there is some chance of an
accident for no matter how carefully you calculate the strain of a
bursting charge of powder and how strongly you construct the
breechblock to stand the strain there is always the possibility of a
flaw in the metal So Ned I think well just go to the bombproof
ourselves when we see General Waller making for the same place

I suppose remarked Ned that in actual warfare anyone who fired one
of the big guns would have to stand close to itcloser than that
soldier is now

Oh yesmuch replied Tom as he watched General Waller giving the
last instructions to the private who was to press the button Only of
course in war the guns will have been tested and this one has not
Here he comes I guess wed better be moving

General Waller having assured himself that everything was as right as
possible had given the last word to the private and was now making his
way toward the bombproof within which were gathered his
fellowofficers and friends

You had better retire from the immediate vicinity of the gun said
its inventor to Tom and Ned as he passed them For while I have
absolute confidence in my cannon and I know that it is impossible to
burst it the concussion may be unpleasant at such close range

Thank you said Tom We are going to get in a safe place

He could not refrain from contrasting the generals manner now with
what it had been at first

As for Ned he could not help wondering why if the inventor had such
absolute faith in his weapon he did not fire it himself even at the
risk of a concussion

How it happened was never accurately known as the soldier declared
positivelyafter he came out of the hospitalthat he had not pressed
the button The theory was that the wires had become crossed making a
short circuit which caused the gun to go off prematurely

But suddenly while Tom Ned and General Waller were still some
distance away from the bombproof there was a terrific explosion It
seemed as if the very foundations of the fortifications would be
shattered There was a roaring in the aira hot burst of flame and
instantly such a vacuum was created that Tom and Ned found themselves
gasping for breath

Dazed shaken in every bone with their muscles sore they picked
themselves up from the ground along which they had been blown with
great force in the direction of the bombproof Even as Tom struggled
to his feet intending to run to safety in fear of other explosions he
realized what had happened

Whatwhat was it cried Ned as he too arose

The gun burst yelled Tom

He looked to the left and saw General Waller picking himself up his
uniform torn and blood streaming from a cut on his face At the same
instant Tom was aware of the body of a man flying through the air
toward a distant grass plot and the young inventor recognized it as
that of the soldier who had been detailed to fire the great cannon

Almost instantaneously as everything happened Tom was aware of
noticing several things as though they took place in sequence He
looked toward where the gun had stood It was in ruins The young
inventor saw something which he took to be the projectile skimming
across the sea waves and he had a fleeting glimpse of the greater
portion of the immense weapon itself sinking into the depths of the
ocean

Then coming down from a great height in the air he saw a dark object
It was another piece of the cannon that had been hurled skyward

Look out Tom yelled instinctively as he staggered toward the
bombproof Ned following

He saw a number of officers running out to assist General Waller who
seemed too dazed to move Many of them had torn uniforms and not a few
were bleeding from their injuries Then the air seemed filled with a
rain of small missilesstones dirt gravel and pieces of metal




CHAPTER VIII

A BIG PROBLEM


Are you much hurt Ned

Tom Swift bent anxiously over the prostrate form of his chum A big
piece of the burst gun had fallen close to Nedso close in fact that
Tom who saw it as he neared the entrance to the bombproof shuddered
as he raced back But there was no sign of injury on his chum

Are you much hurt Ned

The lads eyes opened He seemed dazed

Nono I guess not he answered slowly II guess Im as much
scared as hurt Tom It was the wind from that big piece that knocked
me down It didnt actually hit me

No I should say not put in Captain Badger who had run out toward
the two lads If it had hit you there wouldnt have been much of you
left to tell the tale and he nodded toward the big piece of metal Tom
had seen coming down from the sky That part of the cannon forming a
portion of the breech had buried itself deep in the earth It had
landed close to Nedso close that as he said the wind of it as well
as the concussion perhaps had thrown him with enough force to send
the breath from him

Glad to hear that old man exclaimed Tom with a sigh of relief If
youd been hurt I should have blamed myself

That would have been foolish I took the same chance that you did
answered Ned as he arose and limped off between the captain and Tom

A great silence seemed to have followed the terrific report And now
the officers and soldiers began to recover from the stupor into which
the accident had thrown them Sentries began pouring into the proving
grounds from other portions of the barracks and an ambulance call was
sent in

General Wallers comrades had hurried out to him and were now leading
him away He did not seem to be much hurt though like many others he
had received numerous cuts and scratches from bits of stone and gravel
scattered by the explosion as well as from small bits of metal that
were thrown in all directions

Are you hurt General asked Admiral Woodburn as he put his arm
about the shoulder of the inventor

Nothat is to say I dont think so But what happened Did they fire
some other gun in our direction by mistake

For a moment they all hesitated Then the Admiral said gently

No General It was your own gunit burst

My gun My gun burst

That was it Fortunately no one was killed

My gun burst How could that happen I drew every plan for that gun
myself I made every allowance I tell you it was impossible for it to
burst

But it did burst General went on the Admiral You can see for
yourself and he turned around and waved his hand toward the barbette
where the gun had been mounted All that remained of it now was part of
the temporary carriage and a small underportion of the muzzle The
entire breech with the great block had been blown into fragments so
powerful was the powder used The projectile one watcher reported had
gone about three hundred yards over the top of the barbette and then
dropped into the sea very little of the force of the explosive having
been expended on that A large piece of the gun had also been lost in
the water off shore

My gun burst My gun burst murmured General Waller as if unable to
comprehend it My gun burstit is impossible

But it did spoke Admiral Woodburn softly Come you had better see
the surgeon You may be more seriously injured than you think

Was anyone else hurt asked the inventor listlessly He seemed to
have lost all interest for the time being

No one seriously as far as we can learn was the answer

What of the man who fired the gun inquired the General

He was blown high into the air said Tom I saw him

But he is not injured beyond some bruises put in one of the
ambulance surgeons We have taken him to the hospital He fell on a
pile of bags that had held concrete and they saved him It was a
miraculous escape

I am glad of it said General Waller It is bad enough to feel that
I made some mistake causing the gun to burst but I would never cease
to reproach myself if I felt that the man who fired it was killed or
even hurt

His friends led him away and Tom and Ned went over to look at what
remained of the great gun Truly the powder expending its force in a
direction not meant for it had done terrific havoc Even part of the
solid concrete bed of the barbette had been torn up

An official inquiry was at once started and while it would take some
time to complete it for the parts of the gun remaining were to be
subjected to an exhaustive test to determine the cause of the
weakness it was found that there was some defect in the wiring and
battery that was used to fire the charge

The soldier who was to press the button was sure he had not done so as
he had been ordered to wait until General Waller gave the signal from
the bombproof But the gun went off before its inventor reached that
place of safety Just what had caused the premature discharge could
never be learned as part of the firing apparatus had been blown to
atoms

Well Tom what do you think of it asked Ned who had now fully
recovered from the shock The two were about to leave the proving
grounds having seen all that they cared to

I dont know just what to think was the answer It sure was a big
explosion and it goes to prove that no matter how many calculations
you make when you try a new powder in a new gun you dont know whats
going to happen until after it has happenedand then its too late
Its a big problem Ned

Do you think you can solve it Are you still going on with your plan
to build the biggest cannon ever made

I sure am Ned though I dont know that Ill make out any better than
General Waller did Its too bad his was a failure but I think I see
where he made some mistakes

Oh you do eh suddenly exclaimed a voice and from a nearby
parapet where he had gone to look at one of the pieces of his gun
stepped General Waller So you think I made some mistakes Tom Swift
Where pray

In making the breech The steel jackets were of uneven thickness
making the strain unequal Then too I do not think the powder was
sufficiently tested It was probably of uneven strength That is only
my opinion sir

Well you are rather young to give opinions to men who have devoted
almost all their lives to the study of high explosives

I realize that sir but you asked me for my opinion I shall hope to
profit by your mistakes too That is one reason I wanted to see this
test

Then you are seriously determined to make a gun that you think will
rival mine

I am General Waller

For what purposeto sell to some foreign government

No sir cried Tom with flashing eyes If I am successful in making
a cannon that will fire the longest shots on record I shall offer it
to Uncle Sam first of all If he does not want it I shall not dispose
of it to any foreign country

Hum Well I dont believe youll succeed I intend to rebuild my gun
at once though I may make some changes in it I am sure I shall
succeed the next time But as for youa mere youthto hope to rival
men who have made this problem a lifestudyit is preposterous sir
Utterly preposterous and he uttered these words much as he had
declared that it was impossible for his gun to burst even after it was
in fragments

Come on Ned said Tom in a low voice Well go back home




CHAPTER IX

THE NEW POWDER


Bless my cartridge belt Tom you dont really mean to say that stuff
is powder exclaimed Mr Damon

Thats what I hope it will prove to beand powerful powder at that

Why it looks more like excelsior than anything else went on the odd
man gingerly taking up some yellowish shreds in his fingers

And it will burn as harmlessly as excelsior in the open air went on
Tom But I hope to prove when it is confined in a chamber that it
will be highly explosive Im going to make a test of it soon

Give me good notice so I can get over in the next State exclaimed
Ned Newton with a laugh

This was several days after our friends had returned from the
disastrous gun test at Sandy Hook Tom had at once gotten to work on
the problem that confronted hima problem of his own makingto build
a giant cannon that would make the longest shots on record And he had
first turned his attention to the powder or explosive to be used

For he said there is no use having a big gun unless you can fire
it And the gun I am planning will need something more powerful in the
powder line than any Ive ever heard of

Stronger than the kind General Waller used inquired Ned

Yes but Ill make my cannon correspondingly stronger too so there
will be no danger

Bless my shoe buttons exclaimed Mr Damon You boys must have had
your nerve with you to stay around Sandy Hook after that gun went up in
the air

Oh the danger was all over soon after it began spoke Tom with a
smile But now Im going to test some of this powder If you want to
run away Mr Damon Ill have Koku take you up in one of the airships
and youll certainly be safe a mile or so in the air for Tom had
instructed his giant servant how to run one of the simpler biplanes

Nono Tom Ill stick exclaimed the eccentric man Ill not
promise not to hide behind the fence or something like that though
Tom but Ill stick

So will I added Ned How are you going to make the test Tom

Ill tell you in a minute I want to do a little figuring first

Tom had before going to Sandy Hook made some experiments in powder
manufacturing but they had not been very satisfactory He had not been
able to get power enough On his return he had undertaken rather a
daring innovation He had mingled two varieties of powder and the
resulting combination would he hoped prove just what he wanted

The powder was in gelatin form being made with nitroglycerine as a
base It looked as Mr Damon had said like a bunch of excelsior only
it was yellow instead of white and it felt not unlike pieces of dry
macaroni

I have shredded the powder in this manner Tom explained so that it
will explode more evenly and quickly I want it to burn as nearly
instantaneously as possible and I think it will in this form

But how are you going to tell how powerful it is unless you fire it in
a cannon asked Ned And you havent even started your big gun yet

Oh Ill show you declared Tom There are several ways of making a
test but I have one of my own I am going to take a solid block of
steel of known weightsay about a hundred pounds This I will put
into a sort of square cylinder or well closed at the bottom somewhat
like the breech of a gun The block of steel fits so closely in the
square well that no air or powder gas can pass it

In the bottom of this well which may be a foot square I will put a
small charge of this new powder On top of that will come the steel
block Then by means of electric wires I can fire the charge

Attached to the steel well or chamber will be a gauge a pressure
recorder and other apparatus When the powder of which I will use only
a pinch carefully weighing it goes off it will raise the
hundredpound weight a certain distance This will be noted on the
scale There will also be shown the amount of pressure released in the
gas given off by the powder In that way I can make some calculations

How asked Ned who was much interested

Well for instance if one ounce of powder raises the weight three
feet and gives a muzzle pressure of say five hundred pounds I can
easily compute what a thousand pounds of powder acting on a projectile
weighing two tons and a half would do and how far it would shoot it

Bless my differential gear cried Mr Damon A projectile weighing
two and a half tons Tom its impossible

Thats what General Waller said about his gun but it burst just the
same declared Ned Poor man I felt sorry for him He seemed rather
put out at you Tom

I guess he wasa bitthough I didnt mean anything disrespectful in
what I said But now well have this test Koku take the rest of this
powder back Ill only keep a small quantity

The giant who being more active than Eradicate had rather supplanted
the aged colored man did as he was bid and soon Tom with Ned and Mr
Damon to help him was preparing for the test

They went some distance away from any of the buildings for though Tom
was only going to use a small quantity of the explosive he did not
just know what the result would be and he wanted to take no chances

I know from personal experience what the two kinds of powder from
which I made this sample will do he said but it is like taking two
known quantities and getting a third unknown one from them There is an
unequal force between the two samples that may make an entirely new
compound

The steel chamber that was to receive the hundredpound steel block had
been prepared in advance as had the various gauges and registering
apparatus

Well I guess well start things moving now went on Tom as he
looked over the things he had brought from his shops to the deserted
meadow The fact of the test had been kept a secret so there were no
spectators Ned give me a hand with this block Tom went on Its a
little too heavy to lift alone He was straining and tugging at the
heavy piece of steel

Me do exclaimed Koku the giant gently pushing Tom to one side Then
the big man with one hand raised the hundredpound weight as easily
as if it were a loaf of bread and deposited it where Tom wanted it

Thanks exclaimed our hero with a laugh I didnt make any mistake
when I brought you home with me Koku

Huh I could hab lifted dat weight when I was a young feller
exclaimed Eradicate who was it is needless to say jealous of the
giant

The powder had been put in the firing chamber The steel socket had
been firmly fixed in the earth so that if the force of the explosion
was in a lateral direction instead of straight up no damage would
result The weight even if it shot from the muzzle of the improvised
cannon would only go harmlessly up in the air and then drop back
The firing wires were so long that Tom and his friends could stand some
distance away

Are you all ready cried Tom as he looked to see that the wiring was
clear

As ready as we ever shall be replied Mr Damon who with Ned and
the others had taken refuge behind a low hill

Oh this isnt going to be much of an explosion laughed Tom It
wont be any worse than a Fourth of July cannon Here she goes

He pressed the electric button there was a flash a dull muffled
report and for a moment something black showed at the top of the
steel chamber Then it dropped back inside again

Pshaw cried Tom in disappointed tones It didnt even blow the
weight out of the tube That powders no good Its a failure

Followed by the others the young inventor started toward the small
square cannon Tom wanted to read the records made by the gases

Suddenly Koku cried

There him be master There him be and he pointed toward a distant
path that traversed the meadow

He Whom do you mean asked Tom startled the giants excited manner

That man what come and look at Masters new powder was the
unexpected answer Him say he want to surprise you and he come today
but no speak He run away Lookhim go and he pointed toward a
figure of distinctly military bearing hurrying along the road that led
to Shopton




CHAPTER X

SOMETHING WRONG


Bless my buttons cried Mr Damon

Lets chase after him yelled Ned

Koku kin run de fastest oh any oh us put in Eradicate Let him go

Hold onwait a minute exclaimed Tom We want to know who that man
isand why were going to chase after him Koku I guess its up to
you Something has been going on here that I dont know anything about
Explain

Well its no use to chase after him now said Ned There he goes on
his motorcycle

As he spoke the man who even from a rear view presented all the
characteristics of an army man so straight was his carriage leaped
upon a motorcycle that he pulled from the roadside bushes and soon
disappeared in a cloud of dust

No hes gone spoke Tom halfregretfully But who was he Koku
You seemed to know him What was he doing out here watching my test

Me tell said the giant simply Little while after Master come back
from where him say big gun all go smash man come to shop when Master
out one day Him very nice man and him say him know you and want to
help you make big cannon I say Master no be at home Man say him
want to give master a little present of powder for use in new cannon
Master be much pleased man say Make powder better I take and I
want Master to be pleased I put stuff what man gave me in new powder
Man go awayhe laughhe say he be here today see what happenI tell
him you go to make test today Man say Master be much surprised That
all I know

Silence followed Kokus statement To Ned and Mr Damon it was not
exactly clear but Tom better understood his giant servants queer talk

Is that what you mean Koku asked the young inventor after a pause
Did some stranger come here one day when I was out after I had made
my new powder and did he give you some dope to put in it

What you mean by dope

I mean any sort of stuff

Yes man give me something like sugar and I sprinkle it on new powder
for to surprise Master

Well youve done it all right said Tom grimly Have you any of
the stuff left

I put all in iron box where Master keep new powder

Well then some of it must be there yet Probably it sifted through
the excelsiorlike grains of my new explosive and well find it on the
bottom of the powdercase But enough stuck to the strands to spoil my
test Ill just take a reading of the gauges and then well make an
investigation

Tom with Ned to help him made notes of how far the weight had risen
in the tube and took data of other points in the experiment

Pshaw exclaimed Tom There wasnt much more force to my new powder
doped as it apparently has been than to the stuff I can buy in the
open market But Im glad I know what the trouble is for I can remedy
it Come on back to the shop Koku dont you ever do anything like
this again and Tom spoke severely

No Master answered the giant humbly

Did you ever see this man before Koku

No Master

What kind of a fellow was he asked Ned

Oh him got whiskers on him face and stand very straight like stick
bending backwards Him look like a soldier and him blink one eye more
than the other

Tom and Ned started and looked at one another

That description fits General Waller said Ned in a low voice to his
chum

Yes in a way but it would be out of the question for the General to
do such a thing Besides the man who ran away and escaped on his
motorcycle was larger than General Waller

It was hard to tell just what size he was at the distance spoke Ned
It doesnt seem as though he would try to spoil your experiments
though

Maybe he hoped to spoil my cannon remarked Tom with a laugh that
had no mirth in it My cannon that isnt cast yet He probably
misunderstood Kokus story of the test and had no idea it was only a
miniature experimental gun

This will have to be looked into I cant have strangers prowling
about here now that I am going to get to work on a new invention
Koku I expect you after this not to let strangers approach unless I
give the word Eradicate the same thing applies to you You didnt see
anything of this mysterious man did you

No Massa Tom De only spicious man I see was mab own cousin
sneakin around mah chicken coop de odder night I tooks mah ole shot
gun an santered out dat way Den in a little while dere wasnt no
spicious man any mo

You didnt shoot him did you Rad cried Tom quickly

No Massa Tomdat is I didnt shoot on puppose laik De gun jest
natchelly went off by itself accidentallaik an it peppered him good
an proper

Why Rad cried Ned You didnt tell us about this

Well I were shamed ob mah cousin so I was Anyhow I only had salt
an pepper in de gunstid ob shot I spect mah cousin am pretty well
seasoned now But dats de only spicious folks I see ceptin maybe a
peddler what wanted t gib me a dish pan fo a pair ob ole shoes only
I didnt hab any

There are altogether too many strangers coming about here went on
Tom It must be stopped if I have to string charged electric wires
about the shops as I once did

They hurried back to the shop where the new powder was kept and Tom at
once investigated it Taking the steel box from where it was stored he
carefully removed the several handfuls of excelsiorlike explosive On
the bottom of the box and with some of it clinging to some of the
powder threads was a sort of white powder It had a peculiar odor

Ha cried Tom as soon as he saw it I know what that is Its a
new form of guncotton very powerful Whoever gave it to Koku to put
on my powder hoped to blow to atoms any cannon in which it might be
used Theres enough here to do a lot of damage

How is it that it didnt blow your test cylinder to bits asked Ned

For the reason that the stuff I use in my powder and this new
guncotton neutralized one another the young inventor explained One
weakened the other instead of making a stronger combination A
chemical change took place and lucky for us it did It was just like a
man taking an overdose of poisonit defeated itself Thats why my
experiment was a failure Now to put this stuff where it can do no
harm Is this what that man gave you Koku

Thats it Master

There came a tap on the door of the private room and instinctively
everyone started Then came the voice of Eradicate saying

Deres a army genmen out here to see you Massa Tom but I aint
gwine t let him in lessen as how you says so

An army gentleman repeated Tom

Yais sah He say he General Waller an he come on a motorcycle

General Waller exclaimed Tom What can he want out here

And on a motorcycle too added Ned Tom whats going on anyhow

The young inventor shook his head

I dont know he replied but I suppose I had better see him Here
Koku put this powder away and then go outside Mr Damon youll
stay wont you

If you need me Tom Bless my finger nails But there seems to be
something wrong here

Show him in Rad called Tom

Massa Genl Herodotus Waller exclaimed the colored man in pompous
tones as he opened the door for the officer clad in khaki whom Tom
had last seen at Sandy Hook

Ah how do you do Mr Swift exclaimed General Waller extending his
hand I got your letter inviting me to a test of your new explosive I
hope I am not too late

Tom stared at him in amazement




CHAPTER XI

FAILURE AND SUCCESS


Youyou got my letter stammered Tom holding out his hand for a
missive which the General extended II dont exactly understand My
letter

Yes certainly went on the officer It was very kind of you to
remember me afterwell to be perfectly frank with you I did resent
a little your remarks about my unfortunate gun But I see you are of a
forgiving spirit

But I didnt write you any letter exclaimed Tom feeling more and
more puzzled

You did not What is this and the General unfolded a paper Tom
glanced over it Plainly it was a request for the General to be present
at the test on that day and it was signed with Tom Swifts name

But as soon as the young inventor saw it he knew that it was a forgery

I never sent that letter he exclaimed Look it is not at all like
my handwriting and he took up some papers from a nearby table and
quickly compared some of his writing with that in the letter The
difference was obvious

Then who did send it asked General Waller If someone has been
playing a joke on me it will not be well for him and he drew himself
up pompously

If a joke has been playedand it certainly seems so spoke Tom I
had no hand in it And did you come all the way from Sandy Hook because
of this letter

No I am visiting friends in Waterford said the officer naming the
town where Mr Damon lived My cousin is Mr Pierce Watkins

Bless my doorbell exclaimed Mr Damon I know him He lives just
around the corner from me Bless my very thumb prints

General Waller stared at Mr Damon in some amazement and resumed

Owing to the unfortunate accident to my gun and to some slight
injuries I sustained I found my health somewhat impaired I obtained
a furlough and came to visit my cousin The doctor recommended open
air exercise and so I brought with me my motorcycle as I am fond of
that means of locomotion

I used to be murmured Mr Damon but I gave it up

After his machine climbed a tree Tom explained with a smile
remembering how he had originally met Mr Damon and bought the damaged
machine from him as told in the first volume of this series

So when I got your letter continued the General I naturally
jumped on my machine and came over Now I find that it is all a hoax

I am very sorry I assure you said Tom We did have a sort of test
today but it was a failure owing to the fact that someone tampered
with my powder From what you tell me I am inclined to the belief that
the same person may have sent you that letter Let me look at it
again he requested

Carefully he scanned it

I should say that was written in a sort of German hand would you not
also he asked of Mr Damon

I would Tom

A German exclaimed General Waller

At the mention of the word German Koku the giant who had entered
the room to be stared at in amazement by the officer exclaimed

That he Master That he

What do you mean inquired Tom

German man give me stuff for to put in your powder I member now he
talk like Hans who make our garden here and he say yah just the same
like That man German sure

What does this mean inquired the officer

Quickly Tom told of the visit of an unknown man who had prevailed on
the simpleminded giant to dope Toms new powder under the impression
that he was doing his master a favor Then the flight of the spy on a
motorcycle just as the experiment failed was related

We have a German gardener went on Tom and Koku now recalls that
our mysterious visitor had the same sort of speech This ought to give
us a clue

Let me see murmured General Waller In the first place your test
failsyou learn then that your powder has been tampered withyou
see a man riding away in haste after having in all likelihood spied
on your workyour giant servant recalls the visit of a mysterious man
and when the word German is pronounced in his hearing he recalls
that his visitor was of that nationality So far so good

I come to this vicinity for my health That fact as are all such
regarding officers was doubtless published in the Army and Navy
Journal so it might easily become known to almost anyone I receive a
letter which I think is from Tom Swift asking me to attend the test
As the distance is short I go only to find that the letter has been
forged presumably by a German

Question Can the same German be the agent in both cases

Bless my arithmetic how concisely you put it exclaimed Mr Damon

It is part of my training I suppose remarked the officer But it
strikes me that if we find your German spy Tom we will find the man
who played the joke on me And if I do find himwell I think I shall
know how to deal with him and General Waller assumed his
characteristic haughty attitude

I believe you are right General spoke Tom Though why any German
would want to prevent my experiments or even damage my property and
possibly injure my friends I cannot understand

Nor can I spoke the officer

I am sorry you have had your trouble for nothing went on Tom And
if you are in this vicinity when I conduct my next test I shall be
glad to have you come I will send word by Mr Damon and then there
will be no chance of a mistake

Thank you Tom I shall be glad to come I do not know how long I shall
remain in this vicinity If I knew where to look for the German I would
make a careful search As it is I shall turn this letter over to the
United States Secret Service and see what its agents can do And Tom
if you are annoyed again let me know You are a sort of rival so to
speak but after all we are both working to serve Uncle Sam Ill do
my best to protect you

Thank you sir replied Tom On my part I shall keep a good
lookout It will be a bold spy who gets near my shop after this Im
going to put up my highlycharged protecting electric wires again We
were just talking about them when you came in Would you like to look
about here General

I would indeed Tom Have you made your big gun yet

No but I am working on the plans I want first to decide on the kind
of explosive I am to use so I can make my gun strong enough to stand
it

A wise idea I think there is where I made my mistake I did not
figure carefully enough on the strength of material The internal
pressure of the powder I used as well as the muzzle velocity of my
projectile were both greater than they should have been Take a lesson
from my failure But I am going to start on another gun soon andTom
SwiftI am going to try to beat you

All right General answered Tom genially May the best gun win

Bless my powder box cried Mr Damon Thats the way to talk

General Waller was much interested in going about Toms shop and
expressed his surprise at the many inventions he saw While ordnance
matters big guns and high explosives were his hobby nevertheless the
airships were a source of wonder to him

How do you do it Tom he asked

Oh by keeping at it was the modest answer Then my good friends
hereNed and Mr Damonhelp me

Bless my check book exclaimed the odd gentleman It is very little
help I give Tom

General Waller soon took his departure promising to call again to see
Toms test if one were held He also repeated his determination to set
the Secret Service men at work to discover the mysterious German

I cant imagine who would want to injure you or me Tom Swift he
said

Do you think they wanted to injure you General asked Mr Damon

It would seem so remarked Ned That man doped Toms powder hoping
to make it so powerful that it would blow up everything Then he sends
word to the General to be present If there had been a blowup he would
have gone with it

Bless my gaiters yes exclaimed Mr Damon

Well well see if we can ferret him out spoke the officer as he
took his leave

Tom Ned and the others talked the matter over at some length

I wonder if we could trace that man who rode away on the motorcycle
said Ned

Well try decided Tom energetically and in the electric runabout
that had once performed such a service to his fathers bank the young
inventor and his chum were soon traversing the road taken by the spy
They got some traces of himthat is several persons had seen him
passbut that was all So they had to record one failure at least

I wonder if the General himself could have sent that letter mused
Ned as they returned home

What To himself cried Tom in amazement

He might have went on Ned coolly You see Tom he admits that he
was jealous of you Now what is there to prevent him from hiring
someone to dope your powder and then to divert suspicion from
himself faking up a letter and inviting himself to the blowout

But if he did thatwhich I dont believewhy would he come when
there was danger in case his trick worked of the whole place being
blown to kingdom come

Ah but you notice he didnt arrive until after danger of an explosion
had passed commented Ned

Oh pshaw cried Tom I dont take any stock in that theory

Well maybe not replied Ned But its worth thinking about I
believe if General Waller could prevent you from inventing your big
gun he would

The days that followed were busy ones for Tom He worked on the powder
problem from morning to night scoring many failures and only a few
successes But he did not give up and in the meanwhile drew tentative
plans for the big gun

One evening after a hard days work he went to the library where his
father was reading

Tom said Mr Swift do you remember that old fortune hunter Alec
Peterson who wanted me to go into that opal mine scheme

Yes Dad What about him Has he found it

No he writes to say he reached the island safely and has been
working some time He hasnt had any success yet in locating the mine
but he hopes to find it in a week or so

Thats just like him murmured Tom Well Dad if you lose the ten
thousand dollars I guess Ill have to make it up to you for it was on
my account that you made the investment

Well youre worth it Tom replied his father with a smile




CHAPTER XII

A POWERFUL BLAST


Look out with that box Koku Handle it as though it contained a dozen
eggs of the extinct great auk worth about a thousand dollars apiece

Eradicate Dont you dare stumble while youre carrying that tube If
you do youll never do it again

By golly Massa Tom IIs gwine t walk on mah tiptoes all de way

Thus Eradicate answered the young inventor while the giant Koku who
was carrying a heavy case nodded his head to show that he understood
the danger of his task

So you think youve got the right stuff this time Tom asked Ned
Newton

Im allowing myself to hope so Ned

Bless my woodpile cried Mr Damon II really think Im getting
nervous

It was one afternoon about two weeks after Tom had made his first test
of the new powder Now after much hard work and following many other
tests some of which were more or less successful he had reached the
point where he believed he was on the threshold of success He had
succeeded in making a new explosive that in the preliminary tests in
which only a small quantity was used gave promise of being more
powerful than any Tom had ever experimented withhis own or the
product of some other inventor

And his experiments had not always been harmless Once he came within a
narrow margin of blowing up the shop and himself with it and on
another occasion some of the slowburning powder failing to explode
had set ablaze a shack in which he was working

Only for the prompt action of Koku Tom might have been seriously
injured As it was he lost some valuable patterns and papers

But he had gone on his way surmounting failure after failure until
now he was ready for the supreme test This was to be the explosion of
a large quantity of the powder in a specially prepared steel tube of
great thickness It was like a miniature cannon but unlike the first
small one where the test had failed this one would carry a special
projectile that would be aimed at an armor plate set up on a big hill

Toms hope was that this big blast would show such pressure in
foottons and give such muzzle velocity to the projectile and at the
same time such penetrating power that he would be justified in taking
it as the basis of his explosive and using it in the big gun he
intended to make

The preliminaries had been completed The special steel tube had been
constructed and mounted on a heavy carriage in a distant part of the
Swift grounds A section of armor plate a foot and a half in
thickness had been set up at the proper distance A new projectile
with a hard penetrating point had been madea sort of miniature of
the one Tom hoped to use in his giant cannon

Now the young inventor and his friends were on their way to the scene
of the test taking the powder and other necessaries including the
primers with them Tom Ned and Mr Damon had some of the gauges to
register the energy expended by the improvised cannon There were
charts to be filled in and other details to be looked after

So General Waller wont be here remarked Ned as they walked along
Tom keeping a watchful eye on Koku

No was the reply He has gone back to Sandy Hook He wrote that his
health was better and that he wanted to resume work on a new type of
gun

I guess hes afraid youll beat him out Tom laughed Ned You take
my advice and look out for General Waller

Nonsense I say Rad Look out with those primers

Ise lookin out Massa Tom Golly I dont laik dis yeah job at all
II guess Id better be gittin at dat whitewashin Massa Tom Dat
back fence suah needs a coat mighty bad

Never you mind about the whitewashing Rad You just stick around here
for a while I may need you to sit on the cannon to hold it down

Sit on a cannon Massa Tom Say looky heah now You jest take dese
primary things from dish yeah coon IIse got t go

Why whats the matter Rad Surely youre not afraid are you and
Tom winked at Ned

No Massa Tom Ise not prezactly skeered but I done jest membered
dat I didnt gib mah mule Boomerang any oats tday an hes suahly
gwine t be desprit mad at me fo forgettin dat IId better go

Nonsense Rad I was only fooling You can go as soon as we get to my
private proving grounds if you like But youll have to carry those
primers for all the rest of us have our hands full Only be careful of
em

II will Massa Tom

They kept on and it was noticed that Mr Damon gave nervous glances
from time to time in the direction of Koku who was carrying the box of
powder The giant himself however did not seem to know the meaning of
fear He carried the box which contained enough explosive to blow them
all into fragments with as much composure as though it contained
loaves of bread

Now you can go Rad announced Tom when they reached the lonely
field where pointing toward a big hill was the little cannon

Good Massa Tom cried the colored man and from the way in which he
hurried off no one would ever suspect him of having rheumatic joints

Say that stuff looks just like Swiss cheese remarked Ned as Tom
opened the box of explosive It would be incorrect to call it powder
for it had no more the appearance of gunpowder or any other powder
than as Ned said swiss cheese

And indeed the powerful stuff bore a decided resemblance to that
peculiar product of the dairy It was in thin sheets with holes
pierced through it here and there irregularly

The idea is Tom explained to make a quickburning explosive I
want the concussion to be scattered through it all at once It is set
off by concussion you see he went on A sort of cartridge is buried
in the middle of it after it has been inserted in the cannon breech
The cartridge is exploded by a primer which responds to an electric
current The thin plates with holes corresponding to the centre hole
in a big grain of the hexagonal powder will I hope cause the stuff
to burn quickly and give a tremendous pressure Now well put some in
the steel tube and see what happens

Even Tom was a little nervous as he prepared for this latest test But
he was not nervous enough to drop any of those queer cheeselike
slabs For though he knew that a considerable percussion was needed to
set them off it would not do to take chances High explosives do not
always act alike even under the same given conditions What might with
perfect safety be done at one time could not be repeated at another
Tom knew this and was very careful

The powder as I shall occasionally call it for the sake of
convenience though it was not such in the strict sense of the
wordthe powder was put in the small cannon together with the primer
Then the wires were attached to it and extended off for some distance

But we wont attach the battery until the last moment Tom said I
dont want a premature explosion

The projectile was also put in and Tom once more looked to see that
the armor plate was in place Then he adjusted the various gauges to
get readings of the power and energy created by his new explosive

Well I guess were all ready he announced to his friends Ill
hook on the battery now and well get off behind that other hill I
had Koku make a sort of cave therea miniature bombproof that will
shelter us

Do you think the blast will be powerful enough to make it necessary
asked Mr Damon

It will if this larger quantity of explosive acts anything like the
small samples I set off replied the young inventor

The electric wires were carried behind the protecting hill whither
they all retired

Here she goes exclaimed Tom after a pause

His thumb pressed the electric button and instantly the ground shook
with the tremor of a mighty blast while a deafening sound reared about
them The earth trembled and there was a big sheet of flame seen even
in the powerful sunlight

Something happened anyhow yelled Tom above the reverberating echoes




CHAPTER XIII

CASTING THE CANNON


Come on yelled Ned Well see how this experiment came out and he
started to run from beneath the shelter of the hill

Hold on shouted Tom laying a restraining hand on his chums
shoulder

Why whats the matter asked Ned in surprise

Some of that powder may not have exploded went on the young
inventor From the sound made I should say the gun burst and if it
did that gelatin is bound to be scattered about There may be a mass
of it burning loose somewhere and it may go off It ought not to if
my theory about it being harmless in the open is correct but the
trouble is that its only a theory Wait a few seconds

Anxiously they lingered the echoes of the blast still in their ears
and a peculiar smell in their nostrils

But theres no smoke said Mr Damon Bless my spyglass I always
thought there was smoke at an explosion

This is a sort of smokeless powder explained Tom It throws off a
slight vapor when it is ignited but not much I guess its safe to go
out now Come on

He dropped the pushbutton connected with the igniting battery and
followed by the others raced to the scene of the experiment A curious
sight met their eyes

A great hole had been torn in the hillside and another where the
improvised gun had stood The gun itself seemed to have disappeared

Whywhywhere is it asked Ned

Burst to pieces I guess replied Tom I was afraid that charge was a
bit too heavy

No here it is shouted Mr Damon circling off to one side Its
been torn from the carriage and partly buried in the ground and he
indicated a third excavation in the earth

It was as he had said The terrific blast had sheared the gun from its
temporary carriage thrown it into the air and it had come down to
bury itself in the soft ground The carriage had torn loose from the
concrete base and was tossed off in another direction

Is the gun shattered asked Tom anxious to know how the weapon had
fared It was in a sense a sort of small model of the giant cannon he
intended to have cast

The breech is cracked a little answered Mr Damon who was examining
it but otherwise it doesnt seem to be much damaged

Good cried Tom Another steel jacket will remedy that defect I
guess Im on the right road at last But now to see what became of that
armor plate

Dinner plate not here spoke Koku who could not understand how there
could be two kind of plates in the world Dinner plate gone but big
hole here and he indicated one in the side of the hill

I expect that is where the armor plate is said Tom trying not to
laugh at the mistake of his giant servant Take a look in there Koku
and if you can get hold of it pull it out for us Im afraid the
piece of nickelsteel armor proved too much for my projectile But
well have a look

Koku disappeared into the miniature cave that had been torn in the side
of the bill It was barely large enough to allow him to go in But Tom
knew none other of them could hope to loosen the piece of steel
imbedded as it must be in the solid earth

Presently they heard Koku grunting and groaning He seemed to be having
quite a struggle

Can you get it Koku asked Tom Or shall I send for picks and
shovels

Me get Master was the muffled answer

Then came a shout as though in anger Koku had dared the buried plate
to defy him There was a shower of earth at the mouth of the cave and
the giant staggered out with the heavy piece of armor plate At the
sight of it Tom uttered a cry

Look he shouted My projectile went part way through and then
carried the plate with it into the side of the hill Talk about a
powerful explosive Ive struck it all right

It was as he had said The projectile driven with almost irresistible
force had bitten its way through the armor plate but a projection at
the base of the shell had prevented it from completely passing through
Then with the energy almost unabated the projectile had torn the
plate loose and hurled it together with its own body into the solid
earth of the hillside There as Koku held them up they could all see
the shell imbedded in the plate the point sticking out on the other
side as a boy might spear an apple with a sharp stick

Bless my spectacle case cried Mr Damon This is the greatest ever

It sure is agreed Ned Tom my boy I guess you can now make the
longest shots on record

I can as soon as I get my giant cannon perhaps admitted the young
inventor I think I have solved the problem of the explosive Now to
work on the cannon

An examination of the gauges which being attached to the cannon and
plate by electric wires were not damaged when the blast came showed
that Toms wildest hopes had been confirmed He had the most powerful
explosive ever madeor at least as far as he had any knowledge and he
had had samples of all the best makes

Concerning Toms powder or explosive I will only say that he kept the
formula of it secret from all save his father All that he would admit
when the government experts asked him about it later was that the
base was not nitroglycerine but that this entered into it He agreed
however in case his gun was accepted by the government to disclose
the secret to the ordnance officers

But Toms work was only half done It was one thing to have a powerful
explosive but there must be some means of utilizing it safelysome
cannon in which it could be fired to send a projectile farther than any
cannon had ever sent one And to do this much work was necessary

Tom figured and planned far into the night for many weeks after that
He had to begin all over again working from the basis of the power of
his new explosive And he had many new problems to figure out

But finally he had constructedon papera gun that was to his liking
The most exhaustive figuring proved that it had a margin of safety that
would obviate all danger of its bursting even with an accidental
overcharge

And the next thing is to get the gun cast said Tom to Ned one day

Are you going to do it in your shops his chum asked

No it would be out of the question for me I havent the facilities
Im going to give the contract to the Universal Steel Company Well
pay them a visit in a day or two

But even the great facilities of the steel corporation proved almost
inadequate for Toms giant cannon When he showed the drawings on
which he had already secured a patent the manager balked

We cant cast that gun here he said

Oh yes you can declared Tom who had inspected the plant Ill
show you how

Why we havent a mould big enough for the central core was another
objection

Then well make one declared Tom Well dig a pit in the earth and
after it is properly lined we can make the cast there

I never thought of that exclaimed the manager Perhaps it can be
done

Of course it can cried Tom Do you think you can shrink on the
jackets and rifle the central tube

Oh yes we can do that The initial cast was what stumped me But
well go ahead now

And you can wind the breech with wire and braze it on cant you
persisted Tom

Yes I think so Are you going to have a wirewound gun

That in combination with a steeljacketed one Im going to take no
chances with Swiftite laughed Tom for so he had named his new
explosive in honor of his father who had helped him with the formula

It must be mighty powerful exclaimed the manager

It is said Tom simply

I am not going to tire my readers with the details leading up to the
casting of Toms big cannon Sufficient to say that the general plan
in brief was this A hole would be dug in the earth in the center of
the largest casting shopa hole as deep as the gun was to be long
This was about one hundred feet though the gun when finished would
be somewhat shorter than this An allowance was to be made for cutting

In the center of this hole would be a small core made of asbestos and
concrete mixed Around this would be poured the molten steel from great
caldrons It would flow into the hole The sides of earthlined with
fireclaywould hold it in and the middle core would make a hole
throughout the length of the central part of the gun Afterward this
hole would be bored and rifled to the proper calibre

After this central part was done steel jackets or sleeves would be put
on redhot and allowed to shrink Then would come a winding of wire
to further strengthen the tube and then more sleeves or jackets In
this way the gun would be made very strong

As the greatest pressure would come at the breech or in the powder
chamber there the gun would be thickest at this point decreasing in
size to the muzzle

It took many weary weeks to get ready for the first cast but finally
Tom received word that it was to be made and with Ned and Mr Damon
he proceeded to the plant of the steel concern

There was some delay but finally the manager gave the word Tom and
his friends standing on a high gallery watched the tapping of the
combined furnaces that were to let the molten steel into the caldrons
There were several of these and their melted contents were to be
poured into the mould at the same time

Out gushed the liquid steel giving off a myriad of sparks The
workers as well as the visitors had to wear violettinted glasses to
protect their eyes from the glare

Hoist away cried the manager and the electric cranes started off
with the caldrons of liquid fire weighing many tons

Pour came the command and into the pit in the earth splashed the
melted steel that was to form the big cannon From each caldron there
issued a stream of liquid metal of intense heat There were numerous
explosions as the air bubbles burstexplosions almost like a battery
in action

So far so good exclaimed the manager with a sigh of relief as the
last of the melted stuff ran into the mould Now when it cools which
wont be for some days well see what we have

I hope it contains no flaws spoke Tom That is the worst of big
gunsyou never can tell when a flaw will develop But I hope

Tom was interrupted by the sound of a dispute at one of the outer doors
of the shop

But I tell you I must go inI belong here in a voice cried It had
a German accent and at the sound of it Tom and Ned looked at each
other

Who is there asked the manager sharply of the foreman

Oh a crazy German He belongs in one of the other shops and I guess
hes mixed up He thinks he belongs here I sent him about his
business

That is right remarked the manager I gave orders at your
request he said to Tom that no one but the men in this part of the
plant were to be present at the casting I cant understand what that
fellow wanted

I think I can murmured Tom to himself




CHAPTER XIV

A NIGHT INTRUDER


Tom arent you going to try to get a look at that German whispered
Ned as he and his chum came down from the elevated gallery at the
conclusion of the cast I mean the one who tried to get in

Id like to Ned but I dont want to arouse any suspicion replied
Tom Ive got to stay here a while yet and arrange about shrinking on
the jackets after the core is rifled I dont see how

Ill slip out and see if I can get a peep at him went on Ned If
its like the one Koku described well know that hes still after you

All right Ned Do as you like only be cautious

I will promised Toms chum So while the young inventor was busy
arranging details with the steel manager Ned slipped out of a side
door of the casting shop and looked about the yard He saw a little
group of workmen surrounding a man who appeared to be angry

I dell you dot is my shop one of the men was heard to exclaima man
whom the others appeared to dragging away with main force

And I tell you Baudermann that youre mistaken insisted one
evidently a foreman I told you to work in the brazing department
What do you want to try to force your way into the heavy casting
department for Especially when were doing one of the biggest jobs
that we ever handledmaking the new Swift cannon

Oh iss dot vot vas going on in dere asked the man addressed as
Baudermann Shure den I makes a misdake I ask your pardon Herr
Blackwell I to mine own apartment will go But I dinks my foreman
sends me to dot place and he indicated the casting shop from which he
had just been barred

All right exclaimed the foreman Dont make that mistake again or
Ill dock you for lost time

Only just a twisted German employee I guess thought Ned as he was
about to turn back I was mistaken He probably didnt understand
where he was sent

He passed by the group of men who laughing and jeering at the German
were showing him where to go He seemed to be a new hand in the works

But as Ned passed he got one look at the mans face Instead of a
stupid countenance for one instant he had a glimpse of the sharpest
brightest eyes he had ever looked into And they were hard cruel eyes
too with a glint of daring in them And as Ned glanced at his figure
he thought he detected a trace of military stiffnessnone of the
stoopshouldered slouch that is always the mark of a moulder The
fellows hands too though black and grimy showed evidences of care
under the dirt and Ned was sure his uncouth language was assumed

Id like to know more about you murmured Ned but the man with one
sharp glance at him passed on seemingly to his own department of the
works

Well what was it asked Tom as his chum rejoined him

Nothing very definite but Im sure there was something back of it
all Tom I wouldnt be surprised but what that fellowwhoever he
waswhatever his object washoped to get in to see the casting
either to get some idea about your new gun or to do some desperate
deed to spoil it

Do you think that Ned

I sure do Youve got to be on your guard Tom

I will But I wonder what object anyone could have in spoiling my gun

So as to make his own cannon stand in a better light

Still thinking of General Waller are you

I am Tom

There was nothing more to be done at present and as it would take
several days for the big mass of metal to properly cool Tom Ned and
Mr Damon returned to Shopton

There Tom busied himself over many things Ned helping him and Mr
Damon lending an occasional hand Koku was very useful for often his
great strength did what the combined efforts of Tom and his friends
could not accomplish

As for Eradicate he puttered around doing all he could which was
not much for he was getting old Still Tom would not think of
discharging him and it was pitiful to see the old colored man try to
do things for the young inventortasks that were beyond his strength
But if Koku offered to help Eradicate would draw himself up and
exclaim

Git away fom heah I guess dish yeah coon aint forgot how t wait on
Massa Tom Go way giant I aint so big as yoall but I know de
English language which is mo n yo all does Go on an lemme be

Koku good naturedly gave place for he too felt for Eradicate

Well Ned remarked Tom one day after the visit of the postman I
have a letter from the steel people They are going to take the gun out
of the mould tomorrow and start to rifle it Well take a run down in
the airship and see how it looks I must take those drawings too
that show the new plan of shrinking on the jackets I guess Ill keep
them in my room so I wont forget them

Tom and Ned occupied adjoining and connecting apartments for of late
Ned had taken up his residence with his chum It was shortly after
midnight that Ned was awakened by hearing someone prowling about his
room At first he thought it was Tom for the shorter way to the bath
lay through Neds apartment but when the lad caught the flash of a
pocket electric torch he knew it could not be Tom

Whos there cried Ned sharply sitting up in bed

Instantly the light went out and there was silence

Whos there cried Ned again

This time he thought he heard a stealthy footstep

What is it called Tom from his chamber

Someone is in here exclaimed Ned Look out Tom




CHAPTER XV

READY FOR THE TEST


Tom Swift acted promptly for he realized the necessity The events
that had hedged him about since he had begun work on his giant cannon
made him suspicious He did not quite know whom to suspect nor the
reasons for their actions but he had been on the alert for several
days and was now ready to act

The instant Ned answered as he did and warned Tom the young inventor
slid his hand under his pillow and pressed an auxiliary electric switch
he had concealed there In a moment the rooms were flooded with a
bright light and the two lads had a momentary glimpse of an intruder
making a dive for the window

There he is Tom cried Ned

What do you want demanded Tom instinctively But the intruder did
not stay to answer

Instead he made a dive for the casement It was one story above the
ground but this did not cause him any hesitation It was summer and
the window was open though a wire mosquito net barred the aperture
This was no hindrance to the man however

As Ned and Tom leaped from their beds Ned catching up the heavy empty
water pitcher as a weapon and Tom an old Indian war club that served
as one of the ornaments of his room the fellow with one kick burst
the screen

Then clambering out on the sill he dropped from sight the boys
hearing him land with a thud on the turf below It was no great leap
though the fall must have jarred him considerably for the boys heard
him grunt and then groan as if in pain

Quick cried Ned Ring the bell for Koku Ned I want to capture
this fellow if possible

Who is he asked Ned

I dont know but well see if we can size him up Signal for the
giant

There was an electric bell from Toms room to the apartment of his big
servant and a speaking tube as well While Ned was pressing the
button and hastily telling the giant what had happened urging him to
get in pursuit of the intruder Tom had taken from his bureau a
powerful portable electric flash lamp of the same variety as that
used by the wouldbe thief Only Toms was provided with a tungsten
filament which gave a glaring white pencil of light increased by
reflectors

And in this glare the young inventor saw speeding away over the lawn
the form of a big man

There he goes Ned he shouted

So I see Koku will be right on the job I told him not to dress Can
you make out who the fellow is

No his back is toward us But hes limping all right I guess that
jump jarred him up a bit Where is Koku

There he goes now exclaimed Ned as a figure leaped from the side
door of the housea gigantic figure scantily clad

Get to him Koku cried Tom

Me git Master was the reply and the giant sped on

Lets go out and lend a hand suggested Ned looking at the water
pitcher as though wondering what he had intended to do with it

Im with you agreed Tom Only I want to get into something a little
more substantial than my pajamas

As the two lads hurriedly slipped on some clothing they heard the voice
of Mr Swift calling

What is it Tom Has anything happened

Nothing much was the reassuring answer It was a nearhappening
only Ned woke up in time Someone was in our roomsa burglar I guess

A burglar Good land a massy cried Eradicate who had also gotten up
to see what the excitement was about Did you cotch him Massa Tom

No Rad but Koku is after him

Koku Huh he nebber cotch anybody Ise got t git out dere mahsef
Koku Hu I spects its dat nocount cousin ob mine arter mah
chickens agin Ill lambaste dat coon when I gits him so I will Ill
cotch him for yoall Massa Tom and muttering to himself the aged
colored man endeavored to assume the activity of former years

Hark exclaimed Ned as he and Tom were about ready to take part in
the chase Whats that noise Tom

Sounds like a motorcycle

It is That fellow

Its the same chap interrupted Tom No use trying to chase him on
that speedy machine Hes a mile away from here by now He must have
had it in waiting ready for use But come on anyhow

Where are you going

Out to the shop I want to see if he got in there

But the charged wires

He may have cut them Come on

It was as Tom had suspected The deadly charged wires that formed a
protecting cordon about his shops had been cut and that by an
experienced hand probably by someone wearing rubber gloves who must
have come prepared for that very purpose During the night the current
was supplied to the wires from a storage battery through an
intensifying coil so that the charge was only a little less deadly
than when coming direct from a dynamo

This looks bad Tom said Ned

It does but wait until we get inside and look around Im glad I took
my gunplans to the house with me

But a quick survey of the shop did not reveal any damage done nor had
anything been taken as far as Tom could tell The office of his main
shop was pretty well upset and it looked as though the intruder had
made a search for something and not finding it had entered the house

It was the gunplans he was after all right decided Tom And I
believe it was the same fellow who has been making trouble for me right
along

You mean General Waller

No that Germanthe one who was at the machine shop

But who is hewhat is his object

I dont know who he is but he evidently wants my plans Probably
hes a disappointed inventor who has been trying to make a gun
himself and cant He wants some of my ideas but he isnt going to
get them Well we may as well get back to bed after I connect these
wires again I must think up a plan to conceal them so they cant be
cut

While Tom and Ned were engaged on this Koku came back much out of
breath to report

Me not git Master He git on bangbang machine and go offpuff

So we heard Koku Never mind well get him yet

Hu Ef I had de fust chanst at him Id a cotched dat coon suah
declared Eradicate following the giant Koku he done git in mah way
and he glared indignantly at the big man

Thats all right Rad consoled Tom You did your best Now well
all get to bed I dont believe hell come back Nor did he

Tom and Ned were up at the first sign of daylight for they wanted to
go to the steel works some miles away in time to see the cannon taken
out of the mould and preparations made for boring the rifle channels
They found the manager anxiously waiting for them

Some of my men are as interested in this as you are he said to the
young inventor A number of them declare that the cast will be a
failure while some think it will be a success

I think it will be all right if my plans were followed said Tom
However well see By the way what became of that German who made
such a disturbance the day we cast the core

Oh you mean Baudermann

Yes

Why its rather queer about him The foreman of the shop where he was
detailed saw that he was an experienced man in spite of his seemingly
stupid ways and he was going to promote him only he never came back

Never came back What do you mean

I mean the day after the cast of the gun was made he disappeared and
never came back

Oh exclaimed Tom He said nothing more but he believed that he
understood the mans actions Failing to obtain the desired
information or perhaps failing to spoil the cast he realized that his
chances were at an end for the present

With great care the gun was hoisted from the mould More eyes than
Toms anxiously regarded it as it came up out of the casting pit

Bless my buttonhook cried Mr Damon who had gone with the lads
Its a monster isnt it

Oh wait until you see it with the jackets on exclaimed Ned who had
viewed the completed drawings Then youll open your eyes

The great piece of hollow steel tubing was lifted to the boring lathe
Then Tom and the manager examined it for superficial flaws

Not one cried the manager in delight

Not that I can see added Tom Its a successso far

And that was the hardest part of the work went on the manager of the
steel plant I can almost guarantee you success from now on

And as far as the rifling was concerned this was true I will not
weary you with the details of how the great core of Tom Swifts giant
cannon was bored Sufficient to say that after some annoying delays
caused by breaks in the machinery which had never before been used on
such a gigantic piece of work the rifling was done After the jackets
had been shrunk on it would be rifled again to make it true in case
of any shrinkage

Then came the almost Herculean task of shrinking on the great redhot
steel jackets and wirewindings that would add strength to the great
cannon To do this the central core was set up on end and the jackets
having been heated in an immense furnace were hoisted by a great crane
over the core and lowered on it as one would lower his napkin ring
over the rolled up napkin

It took weeks of hard work to do this and Tom and Ned with Mr Damon
occasionally for company remained almost constantly at the plant But
finally the cannon was completed the rifling was done over again to
correct any imperfections and the manager said

Your cannon is completed Mr Swift I want to congratulate you on it
Never have we done such a stupendous piece of work Only for your plans
we could not have finished it It was too big a problem for us Your
cannon is completed but of course it will have to be mounted What
about the carriage

I have plans for that replied Tom but for the present I am going
to put it on a temporary one I want to test the gun now It looks all
right but whether it will shoot accurately and for a greater distance
than any cannon has ever sent a projectile before is yet to be seen

Where will you test it

That is what we must decide I dont want to take it too far from
here Perhaps you can select a place where it would be safe to fire it
say with a range of about thirty miles

Thirty miles why my dear sir

Oh Im not altogether sure that it will go that distance
interrupted Tom with a smile but Im going to try for it and I want
to be on the safe side Is there such a place near here

Yes I guess we can pick one out Ill let you know

Then I must get back and arrange for my powder supply went on the
young inventor Well soon test my giant cannon

Bless my eardrums cried Mr Damon I hope nothing bursts For if
that goes up Tom Swift

Im not making it to burst put in Tom with a smile Dont worry
Now Ned back to Shopton to get ready for the test




CHAPTER XVI

A WARNING


Whew how it rains exclaimed Ned as he looked out of the window

And it doesnt seem to show any signs of letting up remarked Tom
Its been at it nearly a week now and it is likely to last a week
longer

Its beastly declared his chum How can you test your gun in this
weather

I cant Ive got to wait for it to clear

Bless my rubber boots its just got to stop some time declared Mr
Damon Dont worry Tom

But I dont like this delay I have heard that General Waller has
perfected a new gunand its a fine one from all accounts He has
the proving grounds at Sandy Hook to test his on and Im handicapped
here He may beat me out

Oh I hope not Tom exclaimed Ned Im going to see what the
weather reports say and he went to hunt up a paper

It was several weeks after the completion of Toms giant cannon In the
meanwhile the gun had been moved by the steel company to a
littleinhabited part of New York State some miles from the plant The
gun had been mounted on an improvised carriage and now Tom and his
friends were waiting anxiously for a chance to try it

The work was not complete for the steel company employees had been
hampered by the rain Never before it seemed had there been so much
water coming down from the clouds Nearly every day was misty with
gradations from mere drizzles to heavy downpours There were
occasional clear stretches however and during them the men worked

A few more days of clear weather would be needed before the gun could
be fastened securely to the carriage and then Tom could fire one of
the great projectiles that had been cast for it Not until then would
he know whether or not his cannon was going to be a success

Meanwhile nothing more had been heard or seen of the spy He appeared
to have given up his attempts to steal Toms secret or to spoil his
plans if such was his object

The place of the test as I have said was in a deserted spot On one
side of a great valley the gun was being set up Its muzzle pointed up
the valley toward the side of a mountain into which the gigantic
projectile could plow its way without doing any damage Tom was going
to fire two kinds of cannon ballsa solid one and one containing an
explosive

The gun was so mounted that the muzzle could be elevated or depressed
or swung from side to side In this way the range could be varied Tom
estimated that the greatest possible range would be thirty miles It
could not be more than that he decided and he hoped it would not be
much less This extreme range could be attained by elevating the gun to
exactly the proper pitch Of course any shorter range could within
certain limits also be reached

The gun was pointed slantingly up the valley and there was ample room
to attain the thirtymile range without doing any damage

At the head of the valley some miles from where the giant cannon was
mounted was an immense dam built recently by a water company for
impounding a stream and furnishing a supply of drinking water for a
distant city At the other end of the valley was the thriving village
of Preston A railroad ran there and it was to Preston station that
Toms big gun had been sent to be transported afterward on specially
made trucks drawn by powerful autos to the place where it was now
mounted

Tom had been obliged to buy a piece of land on which to build the
temporary carriage and also contract for a large slice of the opposite
mountain as a target against which to fire his projectiles

The valley as I have said was desolate It was thickly wooded in
spots and in the centre near the big dam which held back the waters
of an immense artificial lake was a great hill evidently a relic of
some glacial epoch This hill was a sort of division between two
valleys

Tom Ned Mr Damon with Koku and some of the employees of the steel
company had hired a deserted farmhouse not far from the place where
the gun was being mounted In this they lived while Tom directed
operations

The paper says clear tomorrow read Ned on his return Clear
with freshening winds

That means rain with no wind at all declared Tom with a sigh
Well it cant be helped As Mr Damon says it will clear some time

Bless my overshoes exclaimed the odd gentleman It always has
cleared hasnt it

No one could deny this

There came a slackening in the showers and Tom and Ned donning
raincoats went out to see how the work was progressing They found
the men from the steel concern busy at the great piece of engineering

How are you coming on asked Tom of the foreman

We could finish it in two days if this rain would only let up
replied the man

Well lets hope that it will observed Tom

If it doesnt theres likely to be trouble up above went on the
foreman nodding in the direction of the great dam

What do you mean

I mean that the water is getting too high The dam is weakening I
heard

Is that so Why I thought they had made it to stand any sort of a
flood

They evidently didnt count on one like this Theyve got the engineer
who built it up there and theyre doing their best to strengthen it I
also heard that theyre preparing to dynamite it to open breeches here
and there in it in case it is likely to give way suddenly

You dont mean it Say if it does go out with a rush it will wipe out
the village

Yes but it cant hurt us went on the foreman Were too high up on
the side of the hill Even if the dam did burst if the course of the
water could be changed to send it down that other valley it would do
no harm for there are no settlements over there and he pointed to
the distant hill

It was near this hill that Tom intended to direct his projectiles and
on the other side of it was another valley running at right angles to
the one crossed by the dam

As the foreman had said if the waters in case the dam burst could be
turned into this transverse valley the town could be saved

But it would take considerable digging to open a way through that side
of the mountain into the other valley went on the man

Yes said Tom and then he gave the matter no further thought for
something came up that needed his attention

Have you your explosive here asked the foreman of the young inventor
the next day when the weather showed signs of clearing

Yes some of it said Tom I have another supply in a safe place in
the village I didnt want to bring too much here until the gun was to
be fired I can easily get it if we need it Jove I wish it would
clear I want to get out in my Humming Bird but I cant if this keeps
up Tom had brought one of his speedy little airships with him to
Preston

The following day the clouds broke a little and on the next the sun
shone Then the work on the gun went on apace Tom and his friends were
delighted

Well I think we can try a shot tomorrow announced Tom with delight
on the evening of the first clear day when all hands had worked at
double time

Bless my powderhorn exclaimed Mr Damon You dont mean it

Yes the gun is all in place went on the young inventor Of course
its only a temporary carriage and not the disappearing one I shall
eventually use But it will do Im going to try a shot tomorrow
Everything is in readiness

There came a knock on the door of the room Tom had fitted up as an
office in the old farmhouse

Who is it he asked

MeKoku was the answer

Well what do you want Koku

Man here say him must see Master

Tom and Ned looked at each other suspicion in their eyes

Maybe its that spy again whispered Ned

If it is well be ready for him murmured his chum Show him in
Koku and you come in too

But the man who entered at once disarmed suspicion He was evidently a
workman from the dam above and his manner was strangely excited

You folks had better get out of here he exclaimed

Why asked Tom wondering what was going to happen

Why Because our dam is going to burst within a few hours Ive been
sent to warn the folks in town in time to let them take to the hills
Youd better move your outfit The dam cant last twentyfour hours
longer




CHAPTER XVII

THE BURSTING DAM


Bless my fountain pen exclaimed Mr Damon You dont mean it

I sure do went on the man who had brought the startling news And
the folks down below arent going to have any more time than they need
to get out of the way Theyll have to lose some of their goods I
reckon But I thought Id stop on my way down and warn you Youd
better be getting a hustle on

Its very kind of you spoke Tom but I dont fancy we are in any
danger

No danger cried the man Say when that water begins to sweepdown
here nothing on earth can stop it That big gun of yours heavy as it
is will be swept away like a straw I knowI saw the Johnstown flood

But were so high up on the side of the hill that the water wont
come here put in Ned We had that all figured out when we heard the
dam was weak Were not in any danger do you think so Tom

Well I hardly do or I would not have set the gun where I did Tell
me he went on to the man is there any way of opening the dam to
let the water out gradually

There is but the openings are not enough with such a flood as this
The engineers never counted on so much rain Its beyond any they ever
had here You see there was a small creek that we dammed up to make
our lake Some of the water from the spillway flows into that now but
its channel wont hold a hundredth part of the flood if the dam goes
out

Youd better move I tell you The dam is slowly weakening Weve
done all we can to save it but thats out of the question The only
thing to do is to run while theres time Weve tried to make
additional openings but we darent make any more or the wall will be
so weakened that it will go out in less than twentyfour hours

Youve had your warning now profit by it he added Im going to
tell those poor souls down in the valley below It will be tough on
them but it cant be helped

If the dam bursts and the water could only be turned over into the
transverse valley this one would be safe said Tom in a low voice

Yes but it cant be done the messenger exclaimed Our engineers
thought of that but it would take a week to open a channel and there
isnt time It cant be done

Maybe it can spoke Tom softly but no one asked him what he meant

Well I must be off the man went on Ive done my duty in warning
you

Yes you have agreed Tom and if any damage comes to us it will be
our own fault But I dont believe there will

The man hastened out murmuring something about rash and foolhardy
people

What are you going to do Tom asked Ned

Stay right here

But if the dam bursts

It may not but if it does well be safe I have had a look at the
water and theres no chance for it to rise here even if the whole dam
went out at once which is not likely Dont worry Well be all
right

Bless my checkbook cried Mr Damon But what about those poor
people in the valley

They will have time to flee and save their lives spoke the young
inventor but they may lose their homes They can sue the water
company for damages though Now dont do any more worrying but get to
bed and be ready for the test tomorrow And the first thing I do Im
going to have a little flight in the Humming Bird to get my nerves in
trim This long rain has gotten me in poor shape Koku you must be on
the alert tonight I dont want anything to happen to my gun at the
last minute

Me watch exclaimed the giant significantly as he picked up a heavy
club

Do you anticipate any trouble asked Ned anxiously

No but its best to be on the safe side answered Tom Now lets
turn in

Certainly the next day bright and sunshiny as it broke had in it
little of impending disaster The weather was fine after the
longcontinued rains and the whole valley seemed peaceful and quiet
At the far end could be seen the great dam with water pouring over it
in a thin sheet forming a small stream that trickled down the centre
of the valley and to the town below

But through great pipes that led to the drinking system though they
were unseen thundered immense streams of solid water reducing by as
much as the engineers were able the pressure on the concrete wall

Tom and Ned in the Humming Bird took a flight out to the dam shortly
after breakfast when the steel men were putting a few finishing
touches to the gun carriage ready for the test that was to take place
about noon

It doesnt look as though it would burst observed Ned as the
aircraft hovered over the big artificial lake

No agreed Tom But I suppose the engineers want to be on the safe
side in case of damage suits I want to take a look at the place where
the other valley comes up to this at right angles

He steered his powerful little craft in that direction and circled low
over the spot

A bursting projectile about where that big white stone is would do
the trick murmured Tom

What trick asked Ned curiously

Oh I guess I was talking to myself admitted Tom with a laugh I
may not have to do it Ned

Well youre talking in riddles today all right Tom When you get
ready to put me wise please do

I will Now well get back and fire our first long shot I do hope I
make a record

There was much to be done in spite of the fact that the foreman of the
steel workers assured Tom that all was in readiness It was some time
that afternoon when word was given for those who wished to retire to an
improvised bombproof Word had previously been sent down the valley so
that no one unless he was looking for trouble need be in the vicinity
of the gun nor near where the shots were to land

Through powerful glasses Tom and Ned surveyed the distant mountain that
was to be the target Several great squares of white cloth had been put
at different bare spots to make the finding of the range easy

I guess were ready now announced the young inventor a bit
nervously Bring up the powder Koku

Me bring exclaimed the giant calmly as he went to the bombproof
where the powerful explosive was kept

The great projectile was in readiness to be slung into the breech by
means of the hoisting apparatus for it weighed close to two tons It
was carefully inserted under Toms supervision It carried no bursting
charge for Toms first shot was merely to establish the extreme range
that his cannon would shoot

Now the powder called the young inventor To avoid accidents Koku
handled this himself the hoisting apparatus being dispensed with Tom
figured out that five hundred pounds of his new powerful explosive
would be about the right amount to use and this quantity divided into
several packages to make the handling easier was quickly inserted in
the breech of the gun by Koku

Bless my doormat cried Mr Damon who stood near looking nervously
on Dont drop any of that

Me no drop was the answer

Tom was busily engaged in figuring on a bit of paper and Ned who
looked over his shoulder saw a complicated compilation that looked to
be a combination of geometry algebra differential calculus and other
higher mathematics

What are you doing Tom he asked

Im trying to confirm my own theories by means of figures to see if I
can really reach that farthest target

What not the one thirty miles away

Thats it Ned I want to get a thirtymile range if I can

It isnt possible Tom

Bless my tape measure I should say not cried Mr Damon

Well see replied Tom quietly Put in the primer Ned and Koku
close the breech and slot it home

In a few seconds the great gun was ready for firing

Now said Tom this thing may be all right and it may not The
only thing that can cause an accident will be a flaw in the steel No
one can guard against that So in order to be on the safe side we
will all go into the bombproof and I will fire the gun from there
The wires are long enough

They all agreed that this was good advice and soon the steel men and
Toms friends were gathered in a sort of cave that had been hollowed
out in the side of the hill and at an angle from the big gun

If it does burstwhich I hope it wont said Tom the pieces will
fly in straight lines so we will be safe enough here Ned are you are
ready at the instruments

Yes Tom

I want you to note the registered muzzle velocity Mr Damon you will
please read the pressure gauge After I press the button Im going to
watch the landing of the projectile through the telescope

The gun had been pointed as I have said at the farthest targetone
thirty miles away telescope sights on the giant cannon making this
possible

All ready cried Tom

All ready answered Ned

There was a tense moment Toms thumb pressed home the electric button
and then came the explosion

It seemed for a moment as if everyone was lifted from his feet They
had all stood on their tiptoes and opened their mouths to lessen the
shock but even then it was terrific The very ground shookfrom the
roof of their cave small stones and gravel rattled down on their heads
Their eardrums were numbed from the shock And the noise that filled
the valley seemed like a thousand thunderbolts merged into one

Tom rushed from the bombproof dropping the electric button He caught
sight of his gun resting undisturbed on the improvised carriage

Hurray he cried in delight She stood the charge all right And
look look he cried as he pointed the glasses toward the distant
hillside There goes my projectile as straight as an arrow There By
Caesar Ned It landed within three feet of the target Oh you
beauty he yelled at his giant cannon You did all I hoped you would
Thirty miles Ned Think of that A twoton projectile being shot
thirty miles

Its great Tom yelled his chum clapping him on the back and
capering about Its the longest shot on record

It certainly is declared the foreman of the steel workers who had
helped in casting many big guns No cannon ever made can equal it You
win Tom Swift

Bless my armor plate gasped Mr Damon What attacking ship against
the Panama Canal could float after a shot like that

Not one declared Tom especially after I put a bursting charge into
the projectile Well try that next

By means of compressed air the gases and some particles of the
unexploded powder were blown out of the big cannon Then it was loaded
again the projectile this time carrying a bursting charge of another
explosive that would be set off by concussion

Once more they retired to the bombproof and again the great gun was
fired Once more the ground shook and they were nearly deafened by the
shock

Then as they looked toward the distant hillside they saw a shower of
earth and great rocks rise up It was like a sand geyser Then when
this settled back again there was left a gaping hole in the side of
the mountain

That does the business cried Tom My cannon is a success

The last shot did not go quite as far as the first but it was because
a different kind of projectile was used Tom was perfectly satisfied
however Several more trials were given the gun and each one confirmed
the young inventor in his belief that he had made a wonderful weapon

If that doesnt fortify the Panama Canal nothing will declared Ned

Well I hope I can convince Uncle Sam of that spoke Tom simply

The muzzle velocity and the pressure were equal to Toms highest hopes
He knew now that he had hit on just the right mixture of powder and
that his gun was correctly proportioned It showed not the slightest
strain

Now well try another bursting shell he said after a rest during
which some records were made Then well call it a days work Koku
bring up some more powder Ill use a little heavier charge this time

It was while the gun was being loaded that a horseman was seen riding
wildly down the valley He was waving a red flag in his hand

Bless my watch chain cried Mr Damon Whats that

It looks as though he was coming to give us a warning suggested the
steel foreman

Maybe someone has kicked about our shooting remarked Ned

I hope not murmured Tom

He looked at the horseman anxiously The rider came nearer and nearer
wildly waving his flag He seemed to be shouting something but his
words could not be made out Finally he came near enough to be heard

The dam The dam he cried Its bursting Your shots have hastened
it The cracks are widening Youd better get away And he galloped on

Bless my toilet soap gasped Mr Damon

I was afraid of this murmured Tom But since our shots have
hastened the disaster maybe we can avert it

How demanded Ned

Ill show you All hands come here and well shift this gun I want it
to point at that big white stone and he indicated an immense boulder
well up the valley near the place where the two great gulches joined




CHAPTER XVIII

THE DOPED POWDER


What are you going to do Tom cried Ned as he with the others
worked the hand gear that shifted the big gun When it was permanently
mounted electricity would accomplish this work Whats your game
Tom

Dont you remember Ned When we were talking about the chance of the
dam bursting I said if the current of suddenly released water could be
turned into the other valley the people below us would be saved

Yes

Well thats what Im going to do Im going to fire a bursting shell
at the point where the two valleys come together Ill break down the
barrier of rock and stone between them

Bless my shovel and hoe cried Mr Damon

If we can turn enough of the water into the other valley where no one
lives and where it can escape into the big river there the amount
that will flow down this valley will be so small that only a little
damage will be done

Thats right declared the steel foreman as he caught Toms idea
Its the only way it could be done too for there wont be time to
make the necessary excavation any other way Is the gun swung around
far enough Mr Swift

No a little more toward me answered Tom as he peered through the
telescope sights There that will do Now to get the proper
elevation and he began to work the other apparatus having estimated
the range as well as he could

In a few seconds the giant cannon was properly trained on the white
rock Meanwhile the horseman with his red flag had continued on down
the valley In spite of his warning of the night before it developed
that a number had disregarded it and had remained in their homes Most
of the inhabitants however had fled to the hills to stay in tents
or with such neighbors as could accommodate them Some lingered to move
their household goods while others fled with what they could carry

It was to see that the town was deserted by these latestayers that the
messenger rode crying his warning as did the messenger at the bursting
of the Johnstown dam twentyodd years ago

The projectile cried Tom as he saw that all was in readiness
Lively now I can see the top of the dam beginning to crumble and he
laid aside the telescope he had been using

The projectile with a heavy charge of bursting powder was slung into
the breech of the gun

Now the powder Koku called Tom Be quick but not so fast that you
drop any of it

Me fetch responded the giant as he hastened toward the small cave
where the explosive was kept As the big man brought the first lot and
Ned was about to insert it in the breech of the gun behind the
projectile Tom exclaimed

Just let me have a look at that Its some that I first made and I
want to be sure it hasnt gone stale

Critically he looked at the powerful explosive As he did so a change
came over his face

Here Koku the young inventor said Where did you get this

In cave Master

Is there any more left

Only enough for this one shoot

By Jove muttered Tom Theres been some trick played here and he
set off on a run toward the bombproof

Whats the matter cried Ned as he noticed the agitation of his chum

The powder has been doped yelled Tom Something has been put in it
to make it nonexplosive Its no good It wouldnt send that shell a
thousand yards and its got to go five miles to do any good My plan
wont work

Doped the powder gasped Ned Who could have done it

I dont know There must have been some spy at work Quick run and
ask the foreman if any of his men are missing Ill see if theres
enough of the good powder left to break down the barrier

Ned was away like a shot while the others not knowing what to make of
the strange conduct of the two lads looked on in wonder Tom raced
toward the cave where the powder was stored Koku following him

Bless my shoe laces cried Mr Damon Look at the dam now

They gazed to where he pointed In several places the concrete spillway
had crumbled down to a ragged edge showing that the solid wall was
giving way The amount of water flowing over the dam was greater now
The creek was steadily rising Down the valley the horseman with the
red flag was but a speck in the distance

What can I do What can I do murmured Tom If all the powder there
is left has been doped I cant save the town What can I do What can
I do

Ned had reached the foreman who with his helpers was standing about
the big gun

Have any of your men left recently yelled Ned

Any of my men left What do you mean

Schlichter went yesterday said the timekeeper I thought he was in
quite a hurry to get his money too

Schlichter gone exclaimed the foreman He was no good anyhow I
think he was a sort of Anarchist always against the government the
way he talked So he has left eh But whats the matter Ned

Something wrong with the powder Tom cant shoot the cannon and turn
aside the water to save the town Some of his enemies have been at
work Schlichter leaving at this time and in such hurry makes it look
suspicious

It sure does And now I recall it I saw him yesterday near your
powder magazine I called him down for it for I knew Tom Swift had
given orders that only his own party was to go near it So the powder
is doped eh

Yes Its all off now

He turned to see Tom approaching on the run

Any good powder left asked Ned

Not a pound Did you hear anything

Yes one man has disappeared Oh Tom weve got to fail after all We
cant save the town

Yes we can Ned If that dam will only hold for half an hour more

What do you mean

I mean that I have another supply of good powder in the village I
secreted some there you remember I told you If I can go get that and
get back here in time I can break down the barrier with one shot and
save Preston

But you never can make the trip there and back in time with the
powder Tom Its impossible The dam may hold half an hour or it may
not But if it does you cant do anything

I cant Well Im going to make a big try Ned You stay on the job
here Have everything ready so that when I get back with the new
explosive which I hope hasnt been tampered with I can shove it into
the breech and set it off Have the wires primers and button all
ready for me

Then Tom set off on the run

Where are you going gasped his chum You can never run to Preston
and back in time

I dont intend to Im going in my airship Koku never mind bringing
the rest of the powder from the cave Its no good Run out the Humming
Bird Im going to drive her to the limit Ive just got to get that
powder here on time

Bless my timetable gasped Mr Damon Thats the only way it can be
done Lucky Tom brought the airship along

The young inventor pausing only to get some cans for the explosive
and some straps with which to fasten them in the monoplane leaped into
the speedy craft

The motor was adjusted Koku whirled the propeller blades There was a
staccato succession of explosions a rushing roaring sound and then
the craft rose like a bird and Tom circled about making a straight
course for the distant town while below him the creek rose higher and
higher as the dam continued to crumble away




CHAPTER XIX

BLOWING DOWN THE BARRIER


Can you see anything of him Ned

Not a thing Mr Damon Waithold onno Its only a bird and the
lad lowered the glasses with which he had been sweeping the sky
looking for his chum returning in his airship with the powder

Hed better hurry murmured the foreman That dam cant last much
longer The water is rising fast When it does go out it will go with a
rush Then goodbye to the village of Preston

Bless my insurance policy cried Mr Damon Dont say such things
my friend

But theyre true insisted the man You can see for yourself that
the cracks in the dam are getting larger It will be a big flood when
it does come And Im not altogether sure that were safe up here he
added as he looked down the sides of the hill to where the creek was
now rapidly becoming a raging torrent

Bless my hatband gasped Mr Damon Youyou are getting on my
nerves

I dont want to be a calamity howler went on the foreman but weve
got to face this thing Wed better get ready to vamoose if Tom Swift
doesnt reach here in time to fire that shotand he doesnt seem to be
in sight

Once more Ned swept the sky with his glasses The roar of the water
below them could be plainly heard now

I wish I could get hold of that rascally German muttered the
foreman Id give him more than a piece of my mind It will be his
fault if the town is destroyed for Toms plan would have saved it I
wonder who he can be anyhow

Some spy declared Ned Weve been having trouble right along you
know and this is part of the game I have some suspicions but Tom
doesnt agree with me Certainly the fellow whatever his object has
made trouble enough this time

I should say so agreed the foreman

Look Ned cried Mr Damon Is that a bird or is it Tom and he
pointed to a speck in the sky Ned quickly focused his glasses on it

Its Tom he cried a second later Its Tom in the Humming Bird

Thank Heaven for that exclaimed Mr Damon fervently forgetting to
bless anything on this occasion If only he can get here in time

Hes driving her to the limit cried Ned still watching his chum
through the glass Hes coming

Hell need to murmured the foreman grimly That dam cant last ten
minutes more Look at the people fleeing from the valley

He pointed to the north and a confused mass of small black
objectsmen women and children doubtless who had lingered in spite
of the other warningcould be seen clambering up the sides of the
valley

Is everything ready at the gun asked Mr Damon

Everything answered Ned whom Tom had instructed in all the
essentials As soon as he lands well jam in the powder and fire the
shot

I hope he doesnt land too hard with all that explosive on board
murmured the foreman

Bless my checkerboard cried Mr Damon Dont suggest such a thing

I guess we can trust Tom spoke Ned

They looked up The distant throb of the monoplanes motor could now be
heard above the roar of the swollen waters Tom could be seen in his
seat and beside him in the other was a large package

Nearer and nearer came the monoplane It began to descend very gently
for well Tom Swift knew the danger of hitting the ground too hard with
the cargo he carried

He described a circle in the air to check his speed Then gently as a
bird he made a landing not far from the gun the craft running easily
over one of the few level places on the side of the hill Tom yanked on
the brake and the ironshod pieces of wood dug into the ground
checking the progress of the monoplane on its bicycle wheels

Have you got it Tom yelled Ned

I have was the answer of the young inventor as he leaped from his
seat

Is it good powder asked the foreman anxiously

I dont know spoke Tom I didnt have time to look I just rushed
up to where I had stored it got some out and came back with the motor
at full speed Ran into an airpocket too and I thought it was all up
with me when I began to fall But I managed to get out of it Say
were going to have it nip and tuck here to save the village

Thats what agreed the foreman as he helped Koku take the cans of
explosive

Wait until I look at it suggested Tom as he opened one His trained
eye and touch soon told him that this explosive had not been tampered
with

Its all right he shouted Into the gun with it and well see what
happens

It was the work of only a few moments to put in the charge Then once
more the breechblock was slotted home and the trailing electric
wires unreeled to lead to the bombproof

Tom Swift took one last look through the telescope sights of his giant
cannon He changed the range slightly by means of the hand and
wormscrew gear and then with the others ran to the shelter of the
cave For though the gun had stood the previous tests well Tom had
used a heavier charge this time both in the firing chamber and in the
projectile and he wanted to take no chances

All ready asked the young inventor as he looked around at his
friends gathered in the cave

II guess so answered Ned somewhat doubtfully

Tom hesitated a moment then as his fingers stiffened to press the
electric button there sounded to the ears of all a dull booming sound

The dam It has given way cried Ned

Thats it shouted the foreman Fire

Tom pressed the button Once again was that awful tremor of the
earththe racking shakethe terrific explosion and a shock that
knocked a couple of the men down

All right shouted Tom The gun held together Its safe to go out
Well see what happened

They all rushed from the shelter of the cave Before them was an
aweinspiring sight A great wall of water was coming down the valley
from a large opening in the centre of the dam It seemed to leap
forward like a race horse

Tom declared afterward that he saw his projectile strike the barrier
that separated one valley from the other but none of the others had
eyesight as keen as thisand perhaps Tom was in error

But there was no doubt that they all saw what followed They heard a
distant report as the great projectile burst Then a wall of earth
seemed to rise up in front of the advancing wall of water High into
the air great stones and masses of dirt were thrown

A good shot cried the foreman Just in the right place Tom Swift

For a moment it was as though that wall of water hesitated not
deciding whether to continue on down the populated valley or to swing
over into the other gash where it could do comparatively little harm
It was a moment of suspense

Then as Toms great shot had by means of the exploding projectile
torn down the barrier the water chose the more direct and shorter
path With a mighty roar like a distant Niagara it swept into the new
channel the young inventor had made Into the transverse valley it
tumbled and tossed in muddy billows of foam and only a small portion
of the flood added itself to the already swollen creek

The village of Preston had been saved by the shot from Toms giant
cannon




CHAPTER XX

THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS


Whew Let me sit down somewhere and get my breath gasped Tom when
it was all over

I should think you would want a bit of quiet replied Ned Youve
been on the jump since early morning

Bless my diningroom table cried Mr Damon I should say so Ill
go tell the cook to get us all a good mealwe need it for a
competent cook had been installed in the old farmhouse where Tom and
his party had their headquarters

But you did the trick Tom old man exclaimed Ned fervently as he
looked down the valley and saw the receding water For with the
opening of the channel into the other valley the flood at no time
particularly dangerous near Preston was subsiding rapidly

He sure did declared the foreman No one else could have done it
either

Oh I dont know spoke Tom modestly It just happened so There
was one minute though after I got to the place in Preston where I had
stored the powder that I didnt know whether I would succeed or not

How was that asked Mr Damon

Why in my hurry and excitement I forgot the key to the underground
storeroom where I had put the explosive I knew there was no time to
get another so I took a chance and burst in the door with an axe I
found in the freight depot

I should say you did take a chance declared Ned who knew how
freaky the high explosive was and how likely it was at times to be
set off by the least concussion

But it came out all right went on Tom I bundled it into the other
seat of my Humming Bird and started back

Had most of the folks left town asked the foreman

Nearly all replied Tom The last of them were hurrying away as I
left And it shows how scared they were they didnt pay any attention
to me and my flying machine though Ill wager some of them never saw
one before

Well they dont need to be scared any more put in Mr Damon You
saved their homes for them Tom

Id like to get hold of the fellow who doped my powder thats what
Id like to do murmured the young inventor Ned well have to be
doubly watchful from now on But I must take a look at my gun That
last charge may have strained it

But the giant cannon was as perfect as the day it was turned out of the
shop Not even the extra charge of the powerful explosive had injured
it

Thats fine cried Tom as he looked at every part As soon as this
flood is over well try some more practice shots But were all
entitled to a rest now

The great gun was covered with tarpaulins to protect it from the
weather and then all retired to the house for a bountiful meal Late
that afternoon nearly all signs of the flood had disappeared save that
along the edges of the creek was much driftwood showing the height to
which the creek had risen But it would have gone much higher had it
not been for Toms timely shot

The water from the impounded lake continued to pour down into the cross
valley and did some damage but nothing like what would have followed
its advent into Preston The few inhabitants of the gulch into which
the young inventor had directed the flood had had warning and had fled
in time In Preston some few houses nearest the banks of the rising
creek were flooded but were not carried away

The following day some of the officers of the water company paid a
visit to Tom to thank him for what he had done But for him they would
have been responsible for great property damage and loss of life might
have followed

They intended to rebuild the dam they said on a new principle making
it much stronger

And said the president we will have an emergency outlet gate into
that valley you so providentially opened for us Mr Swift Then in
time of great rain we can let the water out slowly as we need to

Toms chief anxiety now was to bring his perfected gun to the notice
of the United States Government officials To have them accept it he
knew he must give it a test before the ordnance board and before the
officers of the army and navy Accordingly he prepared for this

He ordered several new projectiles some of a different type from those
heretofore used and leaving Koku and Ned in charge of the gun went
back to Shopton to superintend the manufacture of an additional supply
of his explosive He took care too that no spies gained access to it

Then with a plentiful supply of ammunition and projectiles Tom
resumed his practice in the lonely valley He had in the meanwhile
sent requests to the proper government officials to come and witness
the tests

At first he met with no success and he learned incidentally that
General Waller had built a new gun the merits of which he was also
anxious to show

Its a sort of rivalry between us said Tom to Ned

But in a way fortune favored our hero For when General Waller tested
his new gun though it did not burst it did not come up to
expectations and its range was not as great as some of the weapons
already in use

Then too Captain Badger acted as Toms friend at court He pulled
wires to good advantage and at last the government sent word that one
of the ordnance officers would be present on a certain day to witness
the tests

I wish the whole board had come said Tom Probably they have only
sent a young fellow just out of West Point who will turn me down

But Im going to give him the surprise of his life and if he doesnt
report favorably and insist on the whole board coming out here Ill
be much disappointed

Tom made his preparations carefully and certainly Captain Waydell the
young officer who came to represent Uncle Sam was impressed Tom sent
shell after shell heavily charged against the side of the mountain
Great holes and gashes were torn in the earth The gun even exceeded
the range of thirty miles And the heaviest armor plate that could be
procured was to the projectiles of the giant cannon like cheese to a
revolver bullet

Its great Mr Swift Great declared the young captain I shall
strongly recommend that the entire board see this test And when Tom
let him fire the gun himself the young man was more than delighted

He was as good as his word and a week later the entire ordnance board
from the youngest member to the grave and grizzled veterans were
present to witness the test of Toms giant cannon

It is needless to say that it was successful Tom and Ned not to
mention Mr Damon Koku and every loyal member of the steel working
gang saw to it that there was no hitch The solid shots were regarded
with wonder and when the explosive one was sent against the hillside
making a geyser of earth the enthusiasm was unbounded

We shall certainly recommend your gun Mr Swift declared the Chief
of Staff It does just what we want it to do and we have no doubt
that Congress will appropriate the money for several with which to
fortify the Panama Canal

The gun is most wonderful spoke a voice with a German accent It is
surprising

Tom and Ned both started They saw an officer evidently a foreigner
resplendent in gold trimmings and with many medals standing near the
secretary of the ordnance board

Yes General von Brunderger agreed the chief it is a most timely
invention Mr Swift allow me to present you to General von
Brunderger of the German army who is here learning how Uncle Sam does
things

Tom bowed and shook hands He glanced sharply at the German but was
sure he had never seen him before Then all the board and General von
Brunderger who it appeared was present as an invited guest examined
the big cannon critically while Tom explained the various details

When the board members left the chief promised to let Tom know the
result of the formal report as soon as possible

The young inventor did not have long to wait In about two weeks
during which time he and Ned perfected several little matters about the
cannon there came an officiallooking document

Well well soon know the verdict spoke Tom somewhat nervously as
he opened the envelope Quickly he read the enclosure

What is it cried Ned

The government accepts my gun exclaimed the young inventor It
will purchase a number as soon as they can be made We are to take one
to Panama where it will be set up Hurray Ned my boy Now for
Panama




CHAPTER XXI

OFF FOR PANAMA


Well Tom it doesnt seem possible does it old man

Youre right Nedin a way And yet after all the hard work weve
done almost anything is possible

Hard work We Oh pshaw Youve done most of it Tom I only helped
here and there

Indeed and you did more than that If it hadnt been for you Mr
Damon and Koku wed never have gotten off as soon as we did The
government is the limit for doing things sometimes

Bless my timetable but I agree with you put in Mr Damon But at
last we are on the way in spite of delays

This conversation took place on board one of Uncle Sams warships
which the President had designated to take Toms giant cannon to the
Panama Canal

The big gun had been lashed to the deck of the vessel and was well
protected from the weather In the hold the parts of the disappearing
carriage which Tom had at last succeeded in having made were securely
stowed In another part of the warship were the big projectiles some
arranged to be fired as solid shots and others with a bursting charge
There was also a good supply of the powerful explosive and Tom had
taken extraordinary precautions so that it could not be tampered with
Koku had been detailed as a sort of guard over it and to relieve him
was a trustworthy sergeant of marines

If anyone tries to dope that powder now and spoil my test at Panama
declared Tom hell wish hed never tried it

Especially if Koku gets hold of him added Ned grimly

But I dont believe there is any danger went on the young inventor
I spoke about what had happened and the ordnance board took extra
precautions to see that none but men and officers who could be
implicitly trusted had anything to do with this expedition

You dont really believe anything like treachery would be attempted
do you Tom

I dont know what to say Certainly I cant see why anyone connected
with Uncle Sam would want to throw cold water on a plan to fortify the
canal even if an outsider has invented the gunI mean someone like
myself not connected with the army or navy

If its anything its jealousy declared Ned That General Waller

There you go again Ned Lets not talk about it Come on forward and
see what progress we are making

It must not be supposed that to get the big gun aboard the vessel
arrange for a new supply of the explosive and for many of the great
projectiles had been easy work It was a task that taxed the skill and
strength of Tom and his friends to the utmost

There had been wearying delays especially in the matter of making the
disappearing carriage At times it seemed as if the required
projectiles would never be finished The powder too gave trouble for
sometimes batches would be turned out that were utterly worthless

But Tom never gave up even when it seemed that some of the failures
were purposely made Ned declared that there was a conspiracy against
his chum but Tom could not see it that way It was due to a
combination of circumstances he insisted

But finally the gun had been put aboard the ship having been
transported from the proving ground in the valley and they were now en
route to Panama There the giant cannon was to be set up and tried
again If it came up to expectations it was to be finally adopted as
the official gun for the protection of the big canal and Tom would
receive a substantial reward

And Im confident that it will make good said the young inventor to
his chum as they paced the deck of the vessel In fact Im so sure I
have practically engaged the Universal Steel Company to hold itself in
readiness to make several more of the guns

But suppose Uncle Sam decides against the cannon on this second test

Well then Ive lost out thats all declared Tom philosophically
But I dont believe they will

It certainly is a giant cannon remarked Ned as he paused to look at
the prostrate monster lashed to the deck with its wrappings of
tarpaulins It looks bigger here than it did when you fired the shot
that saved the town Tom

Yes I suppose it does by contrast But lets go down and see how the
powder and shells are standing the trip I told the captain to have
them securely lashed so if we struck rough weather and the vessel
rolled they wouldnt carry away

Especially the powder put in Ned If that starts to banging
aroundwell Id rather be somewhere else

Bless my rain gauge cried Mr Damon Please dont say such things
You make me nervous Youre as bad as that steel foreman

All right Ill be better promised Ned with a laugh

The two chums found that every precaution had been taken in regard to
the projectiles and powder Koku was on guard the giant regarding the
boxes of explosive with a calm but determined eye It would not be well
for any unauthorized hand to tamper with them

Am dere anyting I kin do fo yoall Massa Tom inquired Eradicate
as the young inventor and Ned prepared to go on deck again The aged
colored man had insisted on coming as a sort of personal bodyguard to
Tom and the latter had not the heart to refuse him Eradicate was
desperately jealous of the giant

Huh Eradicate had said anybody kin sit an look at a lot ob dem
powder boxes but taint everybody what kin wait on Massa Tom I kin
an Ise gwine t do it And so he had

It was planned to proceed directly to Colon the eastern terminus of
the canal from New York stopping at Santiago to transact some
government business there The big gun was to be mounted on a barbette
near the Gatun locks pointing out to sea and the trial shots would be
fired over the water

Eventually the gun would be so mounted as to swing in a circle so as
to command the land as well as the water and in fact if the
government decided to adopt Toms giant cannon as the official
protective arm of the canal they would all be so mounted For of
course it might be possible for land as well as sea forces to attack
and try to capture the big ditch

The first few days of the voyage were pleasant enough The weather was
fine and Tom was kept busy explaining to many of the officers aboard
the ship the principles of his gun powder and projectiles Members of
the ordnance board who had been detailed to witness the test were
also much interested as Tom modestly described his work on the giant
cannon

At Santiago de Cuba when Tom and Ned were standing near the gangway
watching the officers returning from shore leave for the ship was to
proceed soon after a two days stay the young inventor started as he
noticed a military man walking aboard

Look Ned he exclaimed in a low voice

Where

At that manan officer in civilian dress I should judgehavent you
seen him before

I have Tom Now where was it I seem to remember his face and yet
he wasnt dressed like this the last time I saw him

I guess not Ned He had on a uniform then

By jinks I have it That German officervon Brunderger Thats he

Youre right Ned And hes got his servant with him I guess and
Tom nodded toward a stolid German who was carrying the others suitcase

I wonder what hes doing aboard here went on our heros chum

Well soon know spoke Tom Hes seen us and is nodding We might as
well go meet him

Ah my good friend Tom Swift exclaimed General von Brunderger
genially as he grasped the hands of Tom and Ned I am glad to see you
both again He seemed to mean it though he had not been especially
cordial to them at the first gun test Take my grip below he said
in German to the man and Rudolph find Lieutenant Blake and inform
him that I am on board I have been invited to go to Panama by
Lieutenant Blake he added to Tom I have never seen the big ditch
that you wonderful Americans have so nearly finished

It is going to be a big thing spoke Tom I am proud that my gun is
going to help protect it

Ah so you were successful then and his voice expressed surprise
I had not heard And the big gun is he here Though speaking very
good English von Brunderger occasionally lapsed into the idioms of his
Fatherland

Yes its on board said Tom Are you going to Panama for any
special purpose

Ned declared afterward that the German started as Tom asked this
question but if he did the young inventor scarcely noticed it In an
instant however von Brunderger was composed again

I go but to see the big ditch before the water is let in he replied
And since your gun is to have a test I shall be glad to witness that
You see I am commissioned by my Kaiser to learn all that you Americans
will allow me to in reference to your ways of doing thingsin the
army the navy and in the pursuit of peace After all preparation for
war is the best means of securing peace Your officers have been more
than kind and I have taken advantage of the offer to go to Panama
Lieutenant Blake said the ship would stop here and as I had business
in Cuba I came and waited I am delighted to see you both again

He went below leaving Tom and Ned staring at one another

Well what do you think of it asked Ned

I dont see anything to be worried about declared Tom Its true
that a German once tried to make trouble for me but this von
Brunderger is all right as far as I can learn He has the highest
references and is an accredited representative of the Kaiser You are
too suspicious Ned just as you were in the case of General Waller

Maybe so

From Santiago swinging around the island of Jamaica the warship took
her way with the big gun to Colon When half way across the Caribbean
Sea they encountered rough weather

The storm broke without any unusual preliminaries but quickly
increased to a hurricane and when night fell it saw the big ship
rolling and tossing in a tempestuous sea Tom was anxious about his
big gun but the captain assured him that double lashings would make it
perfectly safe

Tom and Ned had seen little of the German officer that day nor in
fact since he came aboard He kept much in the quarters of the other
officers and the report was current that he was a jolly good fellow

Rather anxious as to the outcome of the storm Tom turned in late that
night not expecting to sleep much for there were many unusual noises
But he did drop off into a doze only to be awakened about an hour
later by a commotion on deck

Whats up Ned he called to his chum who had an adjoining stateroom

I dont know Tom Something is going on though Hear that thumping
and pounding

As Ned spoke there came a tremendous noise from the deck

By Jove yelled Tom jumping from his berth Its my big gun It has
torn loose from the lashings and may roll overboard




CHAPTER XXII

AT GATUN LOCKS


Steady there now men Pass forward those lashings Careful Look
out or youll be caught by it when she rolls Another turn around the
bitts

It was the officer of the deck giving orders to a number of marines and
sailors as Tom hastily clad leaped on deck followed by his chum The
warship was pitching and tossing worse than ever in the heaving
billows and the men were engaged in making fast the giant cannon
which as Tom had surmised had torn loose from the steel cables
holding it down on deck

Come on Ned cried Tom Weve got to help here

Thats right Look at her swing would you If she hits anything its
a goner

The breech of the gun appeared to be the end that had come loose while
the muzzle still held fast And this immense mass of steel was swinging
about eluding the efforts of the ships officers and crew to capture
it And it seemed only a question of time when the muzzle would tear
loose too Then free on deck the giant cannon would roll through the
frail bulwarks and plunge into the depths of the sea

Look out for yourselves boys cried the officer as he saw Tom and
Ned This is no plaything

I know it gasped Tom But weve got to fasten it down

Thats what were trying to do answered the other We did get the
bight of a cable over the breech but the men could not hold it even
though they took a couple of turns around the bitts

Ned go call Koku cried Tom We need him up here

Thats right declared his chum If anyone can hold the cable with
the weight of the big gun straining on it the giant can Ill get him

On deck Koku quick gasped Ned Masters cannon may fall into the
sea

But the powder asked the big man simply Master told me to guard
the powder I stay here

No Ill stay insisted Ned You are needed on deck Ill take your
place here

Koku stared uncomprehendingly for a moment while the loosened gun
continued to thump and pound on the deck as though it would burst
through Then it filtered through the dull brain of honest Koku what
was wanted

I go he said and he hurried up the companionway while Ned eager
to be with Tom took up the less exciting work of guarding the powder

Once more with the giant strength of Koku to aid in the work the task
of lashing the gun again to the deck was undertaken A bight of steel
cable was gotten around the breech and then passed to a big bitt or
stanchion bolted to the deck Koku working on the heaving deck amid
the hurricane took a turn around the brace

There came a roll of the ship that threatened to send the gun sliding
against the stanchion but Koku braced himself His arms great bunches
of muscles strained and fairly cracked with the strain The wire rope
seemed to give Then as the ship rolled the other way the strain
eased Koku aided by the cable and by the leverage given by the
several turns about the bitts had held the big gun

Quick cried Tom Now another rope so it cant roll the opposite
way and well have her

For a moment the ship was on a level keel and taking advantage of
this when the weight of the gun would be neutral another cable was
passed around it Then it was a comparatively easy matter to put on
more lashings until the giant cannon was once more fast

Whew But that was tough work exclaimed Tom as he once more entered
the stateroom with Ned

It must have been agreed his chum who had been relieved at the
powder station by the giant

I thought it would surely go overboard went on Tom Only for Koku
it would have Those fellows couldnt hold it when the ship rolled

How did it happen to get loose asked Ned

Oh the cables frayed I suppose Ill take a look in the morning
Say but this is some storm

Is the gun all right now

Yes its fastened down like a mummy It cant get loose unless the
whole deck comes with it We can sleep in peace

Not much sleep in this blow I guess responded Ned

But they did manage to get some rest by morning at which time the
hurricane seemed to have blown itself out The day saw the sea
gradually calm down and the big cannon was made additionally secure
against a possible recurrence of the accident But a few days more and
it would be safe at Colon

Tom and Ned had gone on deck soon after breakfast to look at the
cannon All about were pieces of the broken cables that had been cast
aside when the new lashings were put on Ned picked up one end
remarking

These seem mighty strong Its queer how they broke

Well there was quite a weight upon them spoke Tom

Ned did not reply for a moment Then as he looked at another piece of
a severed cable he exclaimed

Tom the weight of your gun never broke these

What do you mean Ned

I mean that they were partly filed or cut throughthen the storm and
the pressure of the gun did the rest Look

He held out the piece of wire rope There on the end could be seen
several strands cleanly severed as though a file or a hacksaw had been
used

By Jove murmured Tom He looked about the deck There was no one
near the big gun Ned whispered his chum theres something wrong
here Its more of that conspiracy to defeat my aims Dont say
anything about this and well keep our eyes open Well do a bit of
detective work

The scoundrels exclaimed Ned I wish we knew who they were
General Waller isnt aboard and what other of the officers has a gun
of his own that he would rather see accepted by the government than
yours

None that I know of replied Tom

General Waller might have hired someone to

Dont go making any unwarranted charges warned the young inventor

Or perhaps that German Tom might

Hush cautioned Tom Here he comes now and as he spoke General
von Brunderger came strolling along the deck

I am glad to see that the accident of last night had no serious
effects he said smiling

It was no accident burst out Ned

No accident You surprise me I thought

Oh Ned means that some of the cables look as though they had been
cut hastily put in Tom nudging his chum in the ribs as a signal for
him to keep quiet

The cables cut exclaimed the German and his voice indicated anxious
solicitude

Or else filed went on Tom easily with a warning glance at Ned But
I dare say they were old cables that had been used on other work and
may have become frayed Everything is safe now though New cables were
lashed on this morning

I am glad to hear it It would be aerah a national calamity to
lose so valuable a gun and the opening of the canal so near at hand I
am glad that your invention is safe Herr Swift and he smiled
genially at Tom and Ned

What did you shut me off for asked Ned when he and his chum were
alone in their stateroom again

Because I didnt want you to make any breaks before him answered Tom

Then you suspect

I suspect many things Ned but Im not going to show my hand until
Im ready Im going to watch and listen

And Ill be with you

But no further accidents occurred There were no more storms no
attempt was made to meddle with Toms powder and in due season the
ship arrived at Colon and after much labor the great gun its
carriage the shells and the powder were taken to the barbette at the
Gatun locks designed to admit vessels from the Caribbean Sea into
Gatun Lake

And now for some more hard work remarked Tom as all the needful
stores were landed




CHAPTER XXIII

NEWS OF THE MINE


Just a little farther over this way Ned Thats better Now mark it
there and well have it clamped down

But can you get enough elevation here Tom

Oh yes I think so Besides Ive added a few more inches to the lift
of the disappearing carriage and it will send the gun so much farther
in the air I think this will do Where is Koku

Here I be Master

Just get hold of that small derrick Koku and lift up one of the
projectiles I want to see if they come in the right place for the
breech before I set the hoisting apparatus permanently

The giant was soon engaged in winding up the rope of an improvised
hoist that stood about in the position the permanent one was to go
From the interior of the barbette which was in effect a bombproof
structure there was lifted one of the big projectiles destined to be
hurled from Tom Swifts giant cannon

Yes I think that will do decided the young inventor as he watched
Koku Now Mr Damon if you will kindly oversee this part of the
work Ill see if we cant get that motor in better shape It didnt
work worth a cent this morning

Bless my rubber coat Tom Ill do all I can to help you declared
the odd man

Massa Tom Massa Tom called Eradicate

Yes Rad What is it

Heah am dem chicken sandwiches an some hot coffee fo yo all I
done knowed yo all wouldnt hab no time t stop fo dinnah so I done
made yo all up a snack

Thats mighty good of you Rad spoke Tom with a laugh I was
getting pretty hungry but I didnt want to stop until I had things
moving in better shape Come on Ned lets knock off for a few minutes
and take a bite You too Mr Damon

As they sat about the place where the gun was being mounted munching
sandwiches and drinking the coffee which the aged colored man had so
thoughtfully provided Eradicate said with a chuckle

By gar Dey cant git erlong wifout dish yeah coon arter all Ha
ha Dat cocoanut giant he mighty good when it comes t fastening big
guns down so dey wont blow away but when it comes t eatin dey has
t depend on ole Eradicate Ha ha Ise got dat cocoanut giant beat
all right

He sure is jealous of Koku remarked Ned as Tom and Mr Damon smiled
at the colored man

He certainly hit me in the right spot declared Tom as he reached
for another sandwich

They had landed from the warship several days before and from then on
there had been hard work and plenty of it Tom was here there and
everywhere directing matters so that his gun would be favorably placed

Some preliminary work had been done before they arrived in the way of
preparing a place to mount the gun and this work was now proceeding
The officers of the ordnance department were in actual charge but they
always deferred to Tom since he had most at stake

It will be some days before you can actually fire your gun will it
not asked Ned of his chum as they finished the lunch and prepared
to resume work

Yesa week at least I expect It is taking longer to set up the
carriage than I thought But it will be an improvement over the solid
one we formerly used That was fine Rad he concluded as the colored
man went back to the shack of which he had taken possession for himself
and his cooking operations It adjoined the quarters to which Tom Ned
Mr Damon and Koku had been assigned

Golly I aint so old yit but what I knows de stuff Massa Tom laiks
exclaimed the colored man moving off with a chuckle

Tom though he had many suspicions about the cut cables that had nearly
been the cause of his gun sliding into the sea had learned nothing
definitenor had Ned

The German officer with his body servant who seldom spoke had landed
at Colon and was proceeding to make himself at home with the officers
and men who were building the canal Occasionally he paid a visit to
Tom and Ned where they were engaged about the big gun He always
seemed pleasant and interested in their labors asking many questions
but that was all and our hero began to feel that perhaps he was wrong
in his suspicions

As for Ned he veered uncertainly from one suspicion to another At one
time he declared that von Brunderger and General Waller were in a
conspiracy to upset Toms plans Again he would accuse the German
alone until Tom laughingly bade him attend more to work and less to
theories

Slowly the work progressed The gun was mounted after much labor and
then arrangements began to be made for the test A series of shots were
to be fired out to sea and the proper precautions were to be taken to
prevent any ships from being struck

Though if you intend to send a projectile thirty miles said one of
the officers Im afraid there may be some danger after all Are you
sure you have a range of thirty miles Mr Swift

I have answered Tom calmly and with the increased elevation that
I am able to get here it may exceed that

The officer said nothing but he looked at Tom in what our hero thought
was a peculiar manner

A few days before the date set for the test one of the sentinels who
had been detailed to keep curiosityseekers away from the giant cannon
approached Tom and said

There is a gentleman asking to see you Mr Swift

Who is it asked Tom laying aside a pressure gauge he intended
attaching to the gun

He says his name is PetersonAlec Peterson Do you want to see him

Yes let him come up directed the young inventor Do you hear that
Ned he called Our fortunehunting friend is here

Maybe hes found that lost opal mine suggested Ned

I hope he has for dads sake went on Tom Hello Mr Peterson he
called as he noticed the old prospector coming along Have you had
any luck

I heard you were down here said the man not answering the question
directly and as I had to run over from my island for some supplies I
thought Id stop and see you How are you and he shook hands

Fine answered Tom Have you found the lost mine yet

Alec Peterson paused a moment Then he said slowly

No Tom I havent succeeded in locating the mine yet But II expect
to any day now he added hastily




CHAPTER XXIV

THE LONGEST SHOT


Well Mr Peterson remarked Tom after a pause Im sure I hope you
will succeed in your quest You must have met disappointment so far

I have Tom But Im not going to give up Cant you come over and see
me before you go back North

Ill try Just where is your island

Off in that direction responded the fortunehunter pointing to the
northeast Its a little farther from here than I thought it was at
firstabout thirty miles But I have a little secondhand steam launch
that my pardners and I use Ill come for you take you over and bring
you back any time you say

After my gun has been tested said Tom with a smile Better stay
and see it

No I must get back to the island I have some new information that I
am sure will enable me to locate the lost mine

Well goodbye and good luck to you called Tom as the
fortunehunter started away

Do you think hell ever find the opals Tom asked Ned

His chum shook his head

I dont believe so he answered Alec has always been that
wayalways visionaryalways just about to be successful but never
quite getting there

Then your fathers ten thousand dollars will be lost

Yes I suppose so but in a way dad can stand it And if I make good
on this gun test ten thousand dollars wont look very big to me I
guess dad gave it to Alec from a sort of sentimental feeling anyhow

You mean because he saved you from the live wire

Thats it Ned It was a sort of reward in a way and I guess dad
wont be brokenhearted if Alec doesnt succeed Only of course hell
feel badly for Alec himself Poor old man he wont be able to do much
more prospecting Well Ned lets get to work on that ammunition
hoist It still jams a little on the ways and I want it to work
smoothly Theres no use having a hitcheven a small onewhen the big
bugs assemble to see how my cannon shoots

Thats right Tom Well start off Im with you

The two youths labored for some time being helped of course by the
workmen provided by the government and some from the steel concern

There were many little details to look after not the least of which
was the patrolling of the stretch of ocean over which the great
projectiles would soar in reaching the faroff targets at which Tom had
planned to shoot No ships were to be allowed to cross the thirtymile
mark while the firing was in progress So also the zone where the
shots were expected to fall was to be cleared

But at last all seemed in readiness The gun had been tried again and
again on its carriage The projectiles were all in readiness and the
terribly powerful ammunition had been stored below the gun in a
bombproof chamber ready to be hoisted out as needed

Because the gun had been fired so many times with a charge of powder
heavier than was ordinarily called for and had stood the strain well
Tom had no fear of standing reasonably close to it to press the button
of the battery There would be no retreating to the bombproof this time

The German officer was occasionally seen about the place where the gun
was mounted but he appeared to take only an ordinary interest in it
Tom began to feel more than ever that perhaps his suspicions were
unfounded

Some officials high in government affairs had arrived at Colon in
anticipation of the test which to Toms delight had attracted more
attention than he anticipated At the same time he was a bit nervous

Suppose it fails Ned he said

Oh it cant cried his chum Dont think about such a thing

Plans had been made for a ship to be stationed near the zone of fire
to report by wireless the character of each shot the distance it
traveled and how near it came to the target The messages would be
received at a station near the barbette and at once reported to Tom
so that he would know how the test was progressing

Well today tells the tale exclaimed the young inventor as he got
up one morning Hows the weather Ned

Couldnt be betterclear as a bell Tom

Thats good Well lets have grub and then go out and see how my pet
is

Oh I guess nothing could happen with Koku on guard

No hardly Im going to keep him in the ammunition room until after
the test too Im going to take no chances

Thats the ticket

The gun was found all right in its great tarpaulin cover and Tom had
the latter taken off that he might go over every bit of mechanism He
made a few slight changes and then got ready for the final trials

On an improvised platform not too near the giant cannon had gathered
the ordnance board the specially invited guests a number of officers
and workers in the canal zone and one or two representatives of
foreign governments Von Brunderger was there but his familiar as
Ned had come to call the stolid German servant was not present

Tom took some little time to explain modestly enough the working of
his gun A number of questions were asked and then it was announced
that the first shot with only a practice charge of powder would be
fired

Careful with that projectile now Thats it slip it in carefully A
little farther forward Thats better Now the powderKoku are you
down there and Tom called down the tube into the ammunition chamber

Me here Master was the reply

All right send up a practice load

Slowly the powerful explosive came up on the electric hoist It was
placed in the firing chamber and the breech closed

Now gentlemen said Tom this is not a shot for distance It is
merely to try the gun and get it warmed up so to speak for the real
tests that will follow All ready

All ready answered Ned who was acting as chief assistant

Here she goes cried Tom and he pressed the button

Many were astonished by the great report but Tom and the others who
were used to the service charges hardly noticed this one Yet when the
wireless report came in giving the range as over fourteen thousand
yards there was a gasp of surprise

Over eight miles declared one grizzled officer and that with only
a practice charge What will happen when he puts in a full one

I dont know answered a friend

Tom soon showed them Quickly he called for another projectile and it
was inserted in the gun Then the powder began to come up the hoist
Meanwhile the young inventor had assured himself that the gun was all
right Not a part had been strained

This time when Tom pressed the button there was such a tremendous
concussion that several who were not prepared for it were knocked
back against their neighbors or sent toppling off their chairs or
benches And as for the report it was so deafening that for a long
time after it many could not hear well

But Tom and those who knew the awful power of the big cannon wore
specially prepared eardrum protectors that served to reduce the shock

What is it called Tom to the wireless operator who was receiving
the range distance from the marking ship

A little less than twentynine miles

We must do better than that said Tom Ill use more powder and try
one of the newer shells Ill elevate the gun a trifle too

Again came that terrific report that trembling of the ground that
concussion that blast of air as it rushed in to fill the vacuum
caused and then the vibrating echoes

I think you must have gone the limit this time Tom yelled Ned as
he turned on the compressed air to blow the powder fumes and unconsumed
bits of explosive from the gun tube

Possibly admitted Tom Here comes the report The wireless
operator waved a slip of paper

Thirtyone miles he announced

Hurray cried Mr Damon Bless my telescope The longest shot on
record

I believe it is admitted the chief of the ordnance department I
congratulate you Mr Swift

I think I can do better than that declared Tom after looking at the
various recording gauges and noting the elevation of the gun I think
I can get a little flatter trajectory and that will give a greater
distance Im going to try

Does that mean more powder Tom asked Ned

Yes and the heaviest shell we havethe one with the bursting charge
Ill fire that and see what happens Tell the zoneship to be on the
lookout he said to the wireless operator giving a brief statement of
what he was about to attempt

Isnt it a risk Tom his chum asked

Well not so much Im sure my cannon will stand it Come on now help
me depress the muzzle just a trifle and by means of the electric
current the big gun was raised at the breech a few inches

As is well known cannon shots do not go in straight lines They leave
the muzzle curve upward and come down on another curve It is this
curve described by the projectile that is called the trajectory The
upward curve as you all know is caused by the force of the powder
and the downward by the force of gravitation acting on the shot as soon
as it reaches its zenith Were it not for this force the projectiles
could be fired in straight lines But as it is the cannon has to be
elevated to send the shot up a bit or it would fall short of its mark

Consequently the flatter the trajectory the farther it will go Toms
object then was to flatten the trajectory by lowering the muzzle of
the gun in order to attain greater distance

If this doesnt do the trick well try it with the muzzle a bit
lower and with a trifle more powder he said to Ned as he was about
to fire

The young inventor was not a little nervous as he prepared to press the
button this time It was a heavier charge than any used that day
though the same quantity had been fired on other occasions with safety
But he was not going to hesitate

Coincident with the pressure of Toms fingers there seemed to be a
veritable earthquake The ground swayed and rocked and a number of the
spectators staggered back It was like the blast of a hundred
thunderbolts The gun shook as it recoiled from the shock but the
wonderful disappearing carriage fitted with coiled pneumatic and
hydrostatic buffers stood the strain

Following the awful report the terrific recoil and the howl of the
wind as it rushed into the vacuum created there was an intense
silence The projectile had been seen by some as a dark speck rushing
through the air like a meteor Then the wireless operator could be seen
writing down a message the telephonelike receivers clamped over his
ears

Something happened all right he called aloud That shot hit
something

Not one of the ships cried Tom aghast

I dont know There seems to be some difficulty in transmitting
WaitIm getting it now

As he ceased speaking there came from underneath the great gun the
sound of confused shouts Tom and Ned recognized Kokus voice
protesting

Nonoyou cant come in here Master said no one was to come in

What is it Koku yelled Tom springing to the speaking tube
connecting with the powder magazine at the same time keeping an eye on
the wireless operator Tom was torn between two anxieties

Someone here Master cried the giant Him try to fix powder Ah I
fix you and with a savage snarl the giant in the concrete chamber
below could be heard to attack someone who cried out gutturally in
German

Help Help Help

Come on Ned cried Tom making a dash for the stairs that led into
the magazine There was confusion all about but through it all the
wireless operator continued to write down the message coming to him
through space

What is it Koku What is it cried Tom plunging down into the
little chamber

As he reached it a door leading to the outer air flew open and out
rushed a man badly torn as to his clothes and scratched and bleeding
as to his face On he ran across the space back of the barbette
toward the lower tier of seats that had been erected for the spectators

Its von Brundergers servant gasped Ned recognizing the fellow

What did he do Koku demanded the young inventor

Him sneak in herehave some of that stuff you call dope I sent up
powder and I come back here to see him try to put some dope in
Masters ammunition

The scoundrel cried Tom Theyre trying to break me even at the
last minute Come on Ned

They raced outside to behold a curious sight Straight toward von
Brunderger rushed the man as if in a frenzy of fear He called out
something in German to his master and the latters face went first
red then white He was observed to look about quickly as though in
alarm and then with a shout at his servant the German officer rushed
from the stand and the two disappeared in the direction of the
barracks

What does it mean cried Ned

Give it up answered Tom except that Koku spoiled their trick
whatever it was It looks as if this was the end of it and that the
mystery has been cleared up

Mr Swift Wheres Mr Swift shouted the wireless operator Where
are you

Yes what is it demanded Tom so excited that he hardly knew what he
was doing

The longest shot on record cried the man Thirtythree miles and
it struck exploded and blew the top off a mountain on an island out
there and he pointed across the sunlit sea




CHAPTER XXV

THE LONGLOST MINE


There was a silence after the inspiring words of the operator and then
it seemed that everyone began to talk at once The recordbreaking
shot the effect of it and the struggle that had taken place in the
powder room together with the flight of von Brunderger and his
servant gave many subjects for excited conversation

Ive got to get at the bottom of this cried Tom making his way
through the press of officials to where the wireless operator stood
Just repeat that requested Tom and they all gave place for him
waiting for the answer

The operator read the message again

Thirtythree miles murmured Tom That is better than I dared to
hope But whats that about blowing the top off an island

Thats what you did with that explosive shell Mr Swift The
operator on the firingzone ship saw the top fly off when the shell
struck The ship was about half a mile away and when they heard that
shell coming the officers thought it was all up with them But
instead it passed over them and demolished the top of the mountain

Anybody hurt asked Tom anxiously

No it was an uninhabited island But you have made the record shot
all right It went farther than any of the others

Then I suppose I ought to be satisfied remarked Tom with a smile

What was that disturbance Mr Swift asked the chief ordnance
officer coming forward

I dont understand it myself replied the young inventor It
appeared that someone went into the ammunition room and Koku my giant
servant attacked him

As he had a right to do But who was the intruder

Herr von Brundergers man

Ha That German officers Where is he he must explain this

But Herr von Brunderger was not to be found nor was his man in
evidence They had fled and when a search was made of their rooms
damaging evidence was found Before a board of investigating officers
Koku told his story after the gun tests had been declared off for the
day they having been most satisfactory

The German officers servant it appeared had managed to gain entrance
to the ammunition chamber by means of a false key to the outer door
There were two entrances the other being from the top of the platform
where the cannon rested Koku had seen him about to throw something
into one of the ammunition cases and had grappled with him There was
a fight and in spite of the giants strength the man had slipped
away leaving part of his garments in the grasp of Koku

An investigation of some of the powder showed that it had been covered
with a chemical that would have made it explode prematurely when placed
in the gun It would probably have wrecked the cannon by blowing out
the breech block and might have done serious damage to life as well as
property

But what was the object asked Ned

To destroy Toms gun declared Mr Damon

Why should von Brunderger want to do that

They found the answer among his papers He had been a German officer of
high rank but had been dismissed from the secret service of his
country for bad conduct Then it appeared he thought of the plan of
doing some damage to a foreign country in order to get back in the good
graces of his Fatherland

He forged documents of introduction and authority and was received
with courtesy by the United States officials In some way he heard of
Toms gun and that it was likely to be so successful that it would be
adopted by the United States government This he wanted to prevent and
he went to great lengths to accomplish this It was he or an agent of
his who forged the letter of invitation to General Waller and who
first tried to spoil Toms test by doping the powder through Koku

Later he tried other means sending a midnight visitor to Toms house
and even going to the length of filing the cables in the storm so the
gun would roll off the warship into the sea All this was found set
down in his papers for he kept a record of what he had done in order
to prove his case to his own government It was his servant who tried
to get near the gun while it was being cast

That he would be restored to favor had he succeeded was an open
question though with Germanys friendliness toward the United States
it is probable that his acts would have been repudiated But he was
desperate

Failing in many attempts he resolved on a last one He sent his servant
to the ammunition room to dope the powder hoping that at the next
shot the gun would be mined Perhaps he hoped to disable Tom But the
plot failed and the conspirators escaped They were never heard of
again probably leaving Panama under assumed names and in disguise

Well that explains the mystery said Tom to Ned a few days later I
guess we wont have to worry any more

No and Im sorry I suspected General Waller

Oh well hell never know it so no harm is done Oh but Im glad
this is over It has gotten on my nerves

I should say so agreed Ned

Bless my pillow sham cried Mr Damon I think I can get a good
nights sleep now So they have formally accepted your giant cannon
Tom

Yes The last tests I gave them showing how easily it could be
manipulated convinced them It will be one of the official defense
guns of the Panama Canal

Good I congratulate you my boy cried the odd man And now bless
my postage stamp lets get back to the United States

Before we go suggested Ned lets go take a look at that island
from which Tom blew the top It must be quite a sightand thirtythree
miles away We can get a launch and go out

But there was no need That same day Alec Peterson came to Colon
inquiring for Tom His face showed a new delight

Why cried Tom you look as though you had found your opal mine

I have exclaimed the fortunehunter Or rather Tom I think I
have you to thank for finding it for me

Me find it

Yes Did you hear about the top of the islandmountain you blew to
pieces

We did but

That was my island exclaimed Mr Peterson The mine was in that
mountain but an earthquake had covered it I should never have found
it but for you That shot you accidentally fired ripped the mountain
apart My men and I were fortunately at the base of it then but we
sure thought our time had come when that shell struck It went right
over our heads But it did the business all right and opened up the
old mine Tom your father wont lose his money well all be rich Oh
that was a lucky shot I knew it was your cannon that did it

Im glad of it answered the young inventor heartily Glad for your
sake Mr Peterson

You must come and see the mineyour mine Tom for it never would
have been rediscovered had it not been for your giant cannon that made
the longest shot on record so Im told

We will come Mr Peterson just as soon as I close up matters here

It did not take Tom long to do this His type of cannon was formally
accepted as a defense for the Panama Canal and he received a fine
contract to allow that type to be used by the government His powder
and projectiles too were adopted

Then one day he and Ned with Koku and Mr Damon visited the scene
of the great shot As Mr Peterson had said the whole top of the
mountain had been blown off by the explosive shell opening up the old
mine While it was not quite as rich as Mr Peterson had glowingly
painted still there was a fortune in it and Mr Swift got back a
substantial sum for his investment

And now for the good old U S A cried Tom as they got ready to go
back home Im going to take a long rest and the only thing Im going
to invent for the next six months is a new potato slicer But whether
Tom kept his words can be learned by reading the next volume of this
series

Bless my hand towel cried Mr Damon I think you are entitled to a
rest Tom

Thats what I say agreed Ned

Ill take care ob himIll take care ob Massa Tom put in Eradicate
as he cast a quick look at Koku Giants am all right fo cannon wuk
but when it comes t comforts Massa Tom gwine t pend on ole
Radicate aint yo all Massa Tom

I guess so Rad exclaimed the young inventor with a laugh Is
dinner ready

It suah am Massa Tom an I specially made some oh dat fricasseed
chicken yo all does admire so much Plenty of it too Massa Tom

Thats good Rad put in Ned For well all be hungry after that
trip to the island That sure was a great shot Tomthirtythree miles

Yes it went farther than I thought it would replied Tom And now
as they are taking a closing meal at Panama ready to return to the
United States we will take leave of Tom Swift and his friends
