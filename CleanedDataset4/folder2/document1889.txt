Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

INTRODUCTION

I write these few introductory sentences to this volume only to second so
worthy an attempt to quicken and enlarge the general interest in our birds
The book itself is merely an introduction and is only designed to place a few
clews in the readers hands which he himself or herself is to follow up I can
say that it is reliable and is written in a vivacious strain and by a real
bird lover and should prove a help and a stimulus to any one who seeks by the
aid of its pages to become better acquainted with our songsters The various
grouping of the birds according to color season habitat etc ought to
render the identification of the birds with no other weapon than an opera
glass an easy matter

When I began the study of the birds I had access to a copy of Audubon which
greatly stimulated my interest in the pursuit but I did not have the opera
glass and I could not take Audubon with me on my walks as the reader may
this volume

But you do not want to make out your bird the first time the book or your
friend must not make the problem too easy for you You must go again and
again and see and hear your bird under varying conditions and get a good hold
of several of its characteristic traits Things easily learned are apt to be
easily forgotten Some ladies beginning the study of birds once wrote to me
asking if I would not please come and help them and set them right about
certain birds in dispute I replied that that would be getting their knowledge
too easily that what I and any one else told them they would be very apt to
forget but that the things they found out themselves they would always
remember We must in a way earn what we have or keep Only thus does it become
ours a real part of us

Not very long afterward I had the pleasure of walking with one of the ladies
and I found her eye and ear quite as sharp as my own and that she was in a
fair way to conquer the bird kingdom without any outside help She said that
the groves and fields through which she used to walk with only a languid
interest were now completely transformed to her and afforded her the keenest
pleasure a whole new world of interest had been disclosed to her she felt as
if she was constantly on the eve of some new discovery the next turn in the
path might reveal to her a new warbler or a new vireo I remember the thrill
she seemed to experience when I called her attention to a purple finch singing
in the treetops in front of her house a rare visitant she had not before
heard The thrill would of course have been greater had she identified the
bird without my aid One would rather bag ones own game whether it be with a
bullet or an eyebeam

The experience of this lady is the experience of all in whom is kindled this
bird enthusiasm A new interest is added to life one more resource against
ennui and stagnation If you have only a city yard with a few sickly trees in
it you will find great delight in noting the numerous stragglers from the
great army of spring and autumn migrants that find their way there If you
live in the country it is as if new eyes and new ears were given you with a
correspondingly increased capacity for rural enjoyment

The birds link themselves to your memory of seasons and places so that A
song a call a gleam of color set going a sequence of delightful
reminiscences in your mind When a solitary great Carolina wren came one
August day and took up its abode near me and sang and called and warbled as I
had heard it long before on the Potomac how it brought the old days the old
scenes back again and made me for the moment younger by all those years

A few seasons ago I feared the tribe of bluebirds were on the verge of
extinction from the enormous number of them that perished from cold and hunger
in the South in the winter of 94 For two summers not a blue wing not a blue
warble I seemed to miss something kindred and precious from my environment 
the visible embodiment of the tender sky and the wistful soil What a loss I
said to the coming generations of dwellers in the country  no bluebird in
the spring What will the farmboy date from But the fear was groundless the
birds are regaining their lost ground broods of young bluecoats are again
seen drifting from stake to stake or from mullenstalk to mullenstalk about
the fields in summer and our April air will doubtless again be warmed and
thrilled by this lovely harbinger of spring  JOHN BURROUGHS August 19
1897


PREFACE

Not to have so much as a bowing acquaintance with the birds that nest in our
gardens or under the very eaves of our houses that haunt our woodpiles keep
our fruittrees free from slugs waken us with their songs and enliven our
walks along the roadside and through the woods seems to be at least a
breach of etiquette toward some of our most kindly disposed neighbors

Birds of prey game and water birds are not included in the book The
following pages are intended to be nothing more than a familiar introduction
to the birds that live near us Even in the principal park of a great city
like New York a birdlover has found more than one hundred and thirty
species as many probably as could be discovered in the same sized territory
anywhere

The plan of the book is not a scientific one if the term scientific is
understood to mean technical and anatomical The purpose of the writer is to
give in a popular and accessible form knowledge which is accurate and
reliable about the life of our common birds This knowledge has not been
collected from the stuffed carcasses of birds in museums but gleaned afield
In a word these short narrative descriptions treat of the birds
characteristics of size color and flight its peculiarities of instinct and
temperament its nest and home life its choice of food its songs and of the
season in which we may expect it to play its part in the great panorama Nature
unfolds with faithful precision year after year They are an attempt to make
the bird so live before the reader that when seen out of doors its
recognition shall be instant and cordial like that given to a friend

The coloring described in this book is sometimes more vivid than that found in
the works of some learned authorities whose conflicting testimony is often
sadly bewildering to the novice In different parts of the country and at
different seasons of the year the plumage of some birds undergoes many
changes The reader must remember therefore that the specimens examined and
described were not as before stated the faded ones in our museums but live
birds in their fresh spring plumage studied afield

The birds have been classed into color groups in the belief that this method
more than any other will make identification most easy The color of the bird
is the first and often the only characteristic noticed But they have also
been classified according to the localities for which they show decided
preferences and in which they are most likely to be found Again they have
been grouped according to the season when they may be expected In the brief
paragraphs that deal with groups of birds separated into the various families
represented in the book the characteristics and traits of each clan are
clearly emphasized By these several aids it is believed the merest novice
will be able to quickly identify any bird neighbor that is neither local nor
rare

To the uninitiated or uninterested observer all small dullcolored birds are
common sparrows The closer scrutiny of the trained eye quickly
differentiates and picks out not only the Song the Canada and the Fox
Sparrows but finds a dozen other familiar friends where one who has eyes and
sees not does not even suspect their presence Ruskin says The more I think
of it I find this conclusion more impressed upon me that the greatest thing
a human soul ever does in this world is to SEE something Hundreds of people
can talk for one who can think but thousands can think for one who can see
To see clearly is poetry prophecy and religion  all in one

While the author is indebted to all the timehonored standard authorities and
to many ornithologists of the present day  too many for individual mention
 it is to Mr John Burroughs her deepest debt is due To this clearvisioned
prophet who has opened the blind eyes of thousands to the delights that
Nature holds within our easy reach she would gratefully acknowledge many
obligations first of all for the plan on which Bird Neighbors is arranged
next for his patient kindness in reading and annotating the manuscript of the
book and not least for the inspiration of his perennially charming writings
that are so largely responsible for the readymade audience now awaiting
writers on outofdoor topics

The author takes this opportunity to express her appreciation of the work the
National Association of Audubon Societies has done and is doing to prevent the
slaughter of birds in all parts of the United States to develop bird
sanctuaries and inaugurate protective legislation Indeed to it more than to
all other agencies combined is due the credit of eliminating so much of the
Prussianlike cruelty toward birds that once characterized American treatment
of them from the rising generation  NELTJE BLANCHAN

Family Alaudidae LARKS

The only true larks to be found in this country are the two species given
below They are the kin of the European skylark of which several unsuccessful
attempts to introduce the bird have been made in this country These two larks
must not be confused with the meadow larks and titlarks which belong to the
blackbird and pipit families respectively The horned larks are birds of the
ground and are seen in the United States only in the autumn and winter In

Family Icteridae BLACKBIRDS ORIOLES ETC

Plumage black or a brilliant color combined with black The meadow lark a
sole exception Sexes unlike These birds form a connecting link between the
crows and the finches The blackbirds have strong feet for use upon the
ground where they generally feed while the orioles are birds of the trees
They are both seed and insect eaters The bills of the bobolink and cowbird
are short and conical for they are conspicuous seed eaters Bills of the

Length from five to nine inches usually under eight inches This the largest
family of birds that we have about oneseventh of all our birds belong to
it comprises birds of such varied plumage and habit that while certain
family resemblances may be traced throughout it is almost impossible to
characterize the family as such The sparrows are comparatively small gray and
brown birds with striped upper parts lighter underneath Birds of the ground
or not far from it elevated perches being chosen for rest and song Nest in
low bushes or on the ground Chipping sparrow often selects tall trees
Coloring adapted to grassy dusty habitats Males and females similar Flight
labored About forty species of sparrows are found in the United States of
these fourteen may be met with by a novice and six at least surely will
be

females either duller or distinct from males bills heavy dull and conical
befitting seed eaters Not so migratory as insectivorous birds nor so
restless Mostly phlegmatic in temperament Fine songsters

Distinctly an American family remarkable for their brilliant plumage which
however undergoes great changes twice a year Females different from males
being dull and inconspicuous Birds of the tropics two species only finding
their way north and the summer tanager rarely found north of Pennsylvania
Shy inhabitants of woods Though they may nest low in trees they choose high
perches when singing or feeding upon flowers fruits and insects As a
family the tanagers have weak squeaky voices but both our species are good
songsters Suffering the fate of most brightplumaged birds immense numbers
have been shot annually
 Scarlet Tanager
 Summer Tanager

Family Hirundinidae SWALLOWS

Birds of the air that take their insect food on the wing Migratory Flight
strong skimming darting exceedingly graceful When not flying they choose
slender conspicuous perches like telegraph wires gutters and eaves of
barns Plumage of some species dull of others iridescent blues and Greens

Family Laniidae SHRIKES

Mediumsized grayish blackandwhite birds with hooked and hawklike bill
for tearing the flesh of smaller birds
fieldmice and large insects that they impale on thorns Handsome bold
birds the terror of all small feathered neighbors not excluding the English
sparrow They choose conspicuous perches when on the lookout for prey a
projecting or dead limb of a tree the cupola of a house the ridgepole or
weathervane of a barn or a telegraph wire from which to suddenly drop upon
a victim Eyesight remarkable Callnotes harsh and unmusical Habits solitary
and wandering The firstnamed species is resident during the colder months of
the year the latter is a summer resident only north of Maryland
 Northern Shrike
 Loggerhead Shrike

Family Vireonidae VIREOS OR GREENLETS

Small greenishgray or olive birds whitish or yellowish underneath their
plumage resembling the foliage of the trees they hunt nest and live among
Sexes alike More deliberate in habit than the restless flitting warblers
that are chiefly seen darting about the ends of twigs Vireos are more
painstaking gleaners they carefully explore the bark turn their heads upward
to investigate the under side of leaves and usually keep well hidden among
the foliage Bill hooked at tip for holding worms and insects Gifted
songsters superior to the warblers This family is peculiar to America
 Redeyed Vireo
 Solitary Vireo
 Warbling Vireo
 Whiteeyed Vireo
 Yellowthroated Vireo

Family Mniotiltidae WOOD WARBLERS

A large group of birds for the most part smaller than the English sparrow
all except the ground warblers of beautiful plumage in which yellow olive
slateblue black and white are predominant colors Females generally duller
than males Exceedingly active graceful restless feeders among the terminal
twigs of trees and shrubbery haunters of treetops in the woods at nesting
time Abundant birds especially during May and September when the majority
are migrating to and from regions north of the United States but they are
strangely unknown to all but devoted bird lovers who seek them out during
these months that particularly favor acquaintance Several species are erratic
in their migrations and choose a different course to return southward from the
one they travelled over in spring A few species are summer residents and
one at least of this tropical family the myrtle warbler winters at the
north The habits of the family are not identical in every representative
some are more deliberate and less nervous than others a few like the
Canadian and Wilsons warblers are expert flycatchers taking their food on
the wing but not usually returning to the same perch like true flycatchers
and a few of the warblers as for example the blackandwhite the pine and
the wormeating species have the nuthatches habit of creeping around the
bark of trees Quite a number feed upon the ground All are insectivorous
though many vary their diet with blossom fruit or berries and naturally
their bills are slender and sharply pointed rarely finchlike The
yellowbreasted chat has the greatest variety of vocal expressions The ground
warblers are compensated for their sober thrushlike plumage by their
exquisite voices while the great majority of the family that are gaily
dressed have notes that either resemble the trill of
midsummer insects or by their limited range and feeble utterance sadly
belie the family name

Family Motacillidae WAGTAILS AND PIPITS

Only three birds of this family inhabit North America and of
these only one is common enough east of the Mississippi to be
included in this book Terrestrial birds of open tracts near the
coast stubblefields and country roadsides with brownish
plumage to harmonize with their surroundings The American pipit
or titlark has a peculiar wavering flight when after being
flushed it reluctantly leaves the ground Then its white tail
feathers are conspicuous Its habit of wagging its tail when
perching is not an exclusive family trait as the family name
might imply
 American Pipit or Titlark

Family Troglodytidae THRASHERS WRENS ETC

Subfamily Miminae THRASHERS MOCKINGBIRDS AND CATBIRDS

Apparently the birds that comprise this large general family are too unlike to
be related but the missing links or intermediate species may all be found far
South The first subfamily is comprised of distinctively American birds Most
numerous in the tropics Their long tails serve a double purposein assisting
their flight and acting as an outlet for their vivacity Usually they inhabit
scrubby undergrowth bordering woods They rank among our finest songsters
with ventriloquial and imitative powers added to sweetness of tone
 Brown Thrasher
 Catbird
 Mockingbird

Subfamily Troglodytinae WRENS

Small brown birds more or less barred with darkest brown above much lighter
below Usually carry their short tails erect Wings are small for short
flight Vivacious busy excitable easily displeased quick to take alarm
Most of the species have scolding notes in addition to their lyrical gushing
song that seems much too powerful a performance for a diminutive bird As a
rule wrens haunt thickets or marshes but at least one species is thoroughly
domesticated All are insectivorous
 Carolina Wren
 House Wren
 WinterWren
 Longbilled Marsh Wren
 Shortbilled Marsh Wren

Family Certhiidae CREEPERS

Only one species of this Old World family is found in America It is a brown
much mottled bird that creeps spirally around and around the trunks of trees
in fall and winter pecking at the larvae in the bark with its long sharp
bill and doing its work with faithful exactness but little spirit It uses
its tail as a prop in climbing like the woodpeckers
 Brown Creeper

Family Paridae NUTHATCHES AND TITMICE

Two distinct subfamilies are included under this general head The nuthatches
Sittinae are small slatecolored birds seen chiefly in winter walking up
and down the barks of trees and sometimes running along the under side of
branches upside down like flies Plumage compact and smooth Their name is
derived from their habit of wedging nuts usually beechnuts in the bark of
trees and then hatching them open with their strong straight bills
 Whitebreasted Nuthatch
 Redbreasted Nuthatch

The titmice or chickadees Parinae are fluffy little gray birds the one
crested the other with a black cap They are also expert climbers though not
such wonderful gymnasts as the nuthatches These cousins are frequently seen
together in winter woods or in the evergreens about houses Chickadees are
partial to treetops especially to the highest pine cones on which they hang
fearlessly Cheerful constant residents retreating to the deep woods only to
nest
 Tufted Titmouse
 Chickadee

Family Sylviidae KINGLETS AND GNATCATCHERS

The kinglets Regulinae are very small greenishgray birds with highly
colored crown patch that are seen chiefly in autumn winter and spring south
of Labrador Habits active diligent flitters among trees and shrubbery from
limb to limb after minute insects Beautiful nest builders Song remarkable
for so small a bird
 Goldencrowned Kinglet
 Rubycrowned Kinglet

The one representative of the distinctly American subfamily of gnatcatchers
Polioptilinae that we have is a small bluegray bird whitish below It is
rarely found outside moist low tracts of woodland where insects abound
These it takes on the wing with wonderful dexterity It is exceedingly
graceful and assumes many charming postures A bird of trees nesting in the
high branches A bird of strong character and an exquisitely finished though
feeble songster
 Bluegray Gnatcatcher

Family Turdidae THRUSHES BLUEBIRDS ETC

This group includes our finest songsters Birds of moderate size stout build
as a rule inhabitants of woodlands but the robin and the bluebird are
notable exceptions Bills long and slender suitable for worm diet Only
casual fruiteaters Slender strong legs for running and hopping True
thrushes are grayish or olivebrown above buff or whitish below heavily
streaked or spotted
 Bluebird
 Robin
 Alices Thrush
 Hermit Thrush
 Olivebacked Thrush
 Wilsons Thrush Veery
 Wood Thrush

Order Columbae PIGEONS AND DOVES

Family Columbidae PIGEONS AND DOVES

The wild pigeon is now too rare to be included among our bird neighbors but
its beautiful relative without the fatally gregarious habit still nests and
sings acoooooo to its devoted mate in unfrequented corners of the farm or
the borders of woodland Delicately shaded fawncolored and bluish plumage
Small heads protruding breasts Often seen on ground Flight strong and
rapid owing to long wings
 Mourning or Carolina Dove

BIRDS CONSPICUOUSLY BLACK

COMMON CROW

Corvus americanus Crow family

Called also CORN THIEF AMERICAN CROW AOU 1998

Length  16 to 1750 inches
Male  Glossy black with violet reflections Wings appear
 sawtoothed when spread and almost equal the tail in length
Female  Like male except that the black is less brilliant
Range  Throughout North America from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico
Migrations  March October Summer and winter resident

If we have an eye for the picturesque we place a certain value upon the
broad strong dash of color in the landscape given by a flock of crows
flapping their course above a cornfield against an October sky but the
practical eye of the farmer looks only for his gun in such a case To him the
crow is an unmitigated nuisance all the more maddening because it is clever
enough to circumvent every means devised for its ruin Nothing escapes its
rapacity fear is unknown to it It migrates in broad daylight chooses the
most conspicuous perches and yet its assurance is amply justified in its
steadily increasing numbers

In the very early spring note well the friendly way in which the crow follows
the plow ingratiating itself by eating the larvae field mice and worms
upturned in the furrows for this is its one serviceable act throughout the
year When the first brood of chickens is hatched its serious depredations
begin Not only the farmers young fledglings ducks turkeys and chicks are
snatched up and devoured but the nests of song birds are made desolate eggs
being crushed and eaten on the spot when there are no birds to carry off to
the rickety coarse nest in the high tree top in the woods The fish crow
however is the much greater enemy of the birds Like the common crows this
their smaller cousin likes to congregate in winter along the seacoast to feed
upon shellfish and other seafood that the tide brings to its feet

Samuels claims to have seen a pair of crows visit an orchard and destroy the
young in two robins nests in half an hour He calculates that two crows kill
in one day alone young birds that in the course of the season would have
eaten a hundred thousand insects When in addition to these atrocities we
remember the crows depredations in the cornfield it is small wonder that
among the first laws enacted in New York State was one offering a reward for
its head But the more scientific agriculturists now concede that the crow is
the farmers true friend


FISH CROW Corvus ossifragus Crow family

Length  14 to 16 inches About half as large again as the
 robin
Male and Female  Glossy black with purplishblue reflections
 generally greener underneath Chin naked
Range  Along Atlantic coast and that of the Gult of Mexico
 northward to southern New England Rare stragglers or the
 Pacific coast
Migrations  March or April September Summer resident only at
 northern limit of range Is found in Hudson River valley about
 halfway to Albany

Compared with the common crow with which it is often confounded the fish
crow is of much smaller more slender build Thus its flight is less labored
and more like a gulls whose habit of catching fish that may be swimming near
the surface of the water it sometimes adopts Both Audubon and Wilson who
first made this species known record its habit of snatching food as it flies
over the southern waters  a rare practice at the north Its plumage too
differs slightly from the common crows in being a richer black everywhere
and particularly underneath where the corn thief is dull But it is the
difference between the two crows callnote that we chiefly depend upon to
distinguish these confusing cousins To say that the fish crow says carrr
instead of a loud clear caw means little until we have had an opportunity to
compare its hoarse cracked voice with the other birds familiar call

From the farmers point of view there is still another distinction the fish
crow lets his crops alone It contents itself with picking up refuse on the
shores of the sea or rivers not far inland haunting the neighborhood of
fishermens huts for the small fish discarded when the seines are drawn and
treading out with its toes the shellfish hidden in the sand at low tide When
we see it in the fields it is usually intent upon catching fieldmice grubs
and worms with which it often varies its fish diet It is however the worst
nest robber we have it probably destroys ten times as many eggs and young
birds as its larger cousin

The fishermen have a tradition that this southern crow comes and goes with the
shad and herring  a saw which science unkindly disapproves


AMERICAN RAVEN

Corvus corax principalis Crow family

Called also NORTHERN RAVEN COMMON RAVEN AOU 1998

Length  26 to 27 inches Nearly three times as large as a
 robin
Male and Female  Glossy black above with purplish and greenish
 reflections Duller underneath Feathers of the throat and
 breast long and loose like fringe
Range  North America from polar regions to Mexico Rare along
 Atlantic coast and in the south Common in the west and very
 abundant in the northwest
Migrations  An erratic wanderer usually resident where it
 finds its way

The weird uncanny voice of this great bird that soars in wide circles above
the evergreen trees of dark northern forests seems to come out of the skies
like the malediction of an evil spirit Without uttering the words of any
language  Poes Nevermore was of course a poetic license  people of
all nationalities appear to understand that some dire calamity some wicked
portent is being announced every time the unbirdlike creature utters its
rasping call The superstitious folk crow with an I told you so as they
solemnly wag their heads when they hear of some death in the village after
the bird of illomen has made an unwelcome visit to the neighborhoodit
receives the blame for every possible misfortune

When seen in the air the crow is the only other bird for which the raven
could be mistaken but the raven does more sailing and less flapping and he
delights in describing circles as he easily soars high above the trees On the
ground he is seen to be a far larger bird than the largest crow The curious
beard or fringe of feathers on his breast at once distinguishes him

These birds show the family instinct for living in flocks large and small not
of ravens only but of any birds of their own genera In the art of nest
building they could instruct most of their relatives High up in evergreen
trees or on the top of cliffs never very near the seashore they make a
compact symmetrical nest of sticks neatly lined with grasses and wool from
the sheep pastures adding soft comfortable linings to the old nest from year
to year for each new brood When the young emerge from the eggs which take
many curious freaks of color and markings they are pied black and white
suggesting the young of the western whitenecked raven a similarity which so
far as plumage is concerned they quickly outgrow They early acquire the
fortunate habit of eating whatever their parents set before them
 grubs worms grain fieldmice anything in fact for the raven is a
conspicuously omnivorous bird


PURPLE GRACKLE Quiscalus quiscula Blackbird family

Called also CROW BLACKBIRD MAIZE THIEF KEELTAILED GRACKLE
 COMMON GRACKLE AOU 1998

Length  12 to 13 inches About onefourth as large again as the
 robin
Male  Iridescent black in which metallic violet blue copper
 and green tints predominate The plumage of this grackle has
 iridescent bars Iris of eye bright yellow and conspicuous
 Tail longer than wings
Female  Less brilliant black than male and smaller
Range  Gulf of Mexico to 57th parallel north latitude
Migrations  Permanent resident in Southern States Few are
 permanent throughout range Migrates in immense flocks in March
 and September

This refined crow which is really no crow at all except in appearance has
scarcely more friends than a thief is entitled to for although in many
sections of the country it has given up its old habit of stealing Indian corn
and substituted ravages upon the grasshoppers instead it still indulges a
crowlike instinct for pillaging nests and eating young birds

Travelling in immense flocks of its own kind a gregarious bird of the first
order it nevertheless is not the social fellow that its cousin the
redwinged blackbird is It especially holds aloof from mankind and mankind
reciprocates its suspicion

The tallest densest evergreens are not too remote for it to build its home
according to Dr Abbott though in other States than New Jersey where he
observed them an old orchard often contains dozens of nests One peculiarity
of the grackles is that their eggs vary so much in coloring and markings that
different sets examined in the same groups of trees are often wholly unlike
The average groundwork however is soiled blue or greenish waved streaked
or clouded with brown These are laid in a nest made of miscellaneous sticks
and grasses rather carefully constructed and lined with mud Another
peculiarity is the birds method of steering itself by its tail when it wishes
to turn its direction or alight

Peering at you from the top of a dark pine tree with its staring yellow eye
the grackle is certainly uncanny There very early in the spring you may
hear its cracked and wheezy whistle for being aware that however much it may
look like a crow it belongs to another family it makes a ridiculous attempt
to sing When a number of grackles lift up their voices at once some one has
aptly likened the result to a good wheelbarrow chorus The grackles mate
alone appreciates his efforts as standing on tiptoe with halfspread wings
and tail he pours forth his craven soul to her through a disjointed larynx
With all their faults and they are numerous let it be recorded of both crows
and grackles that they are as devoted lovers as turtledoves Lowell
characterizes them in these four lines

 Fust come the black birds clattrin in tall trees
 And settlin things in windy Congresses
 Queer politicians though for Ill be skinned
 If all on em dont head against the wind

The Bronzed Grackle Quiscalus quiscula aeneus differs from the preceding
chiefly in the more brownish bronze tint of its plumage and its lack of
iridescent bars Its range is more westerly and in the southwest it is
particularly common but as a summer resident it finds its way to New England
in large numbers The callnote is louder and more metallic than the purple
grackles In nearly all respects the habits of these two birds are identical


RUSTY BLACKBIRD Scolecophagus carolinus Blackbird family

Called also THRUSH BLACKBIRD RUSTY GRACKLE RUSTY ORIOLE RUSTY
CROW BLACKBIRD

Length  9 to 955 inches A trifle smaller than the robin
Male  In full plumage glossy black with metallic reflections
 intermixed with rusty brown that becomes more pronounced as the
 season advances Pale strawcolored eyes
Female  Duller plumage and more rusty inclining to gray Light
 line over eye Smaller than male
Range  North America from Newfoundland to Gulf of Mexico and
 westward to the Plains
Migrations  April November A few winter north

A more sociable bird than the grackle though it travel in smaller flocks the
rusty blackbird condescends to mingle freely with other feathered friends in
marshes and by brooksides You can identify it by its rusty feathers and pale
yellow eye and easily distinguish the rustygray female from the female
redwing that is conspicuously streaked

In April flocks of these birds may frequently be seen along sluggish secluded
streams in the woods feeding upon the seeds of various water or brookside
plants and probably upon insects also At such times they often indulge in a
curious spluttering squeaking musical concert that one listens to with
pleasure The breeding range is mostly north of the United States But little
seems to be known of the birds habits in their northern home

Why it should ever have been called a thrush blackbird is one of those
inscrutable mysteries peculiar to the naming of birds which are so frequently
called precisely what they are not In spite of the compliment implied in
associating the name of one of our finest songsters with it the rusty
blackbird has a clucking call as unmusical as it is infrequent and only very
rarely in the spring does it pipe a note that even suggests the sweetness of
the redwings


REDWINGED BLACKBIRD

Agelaius Phamiceus Blackbird family

Called also SWAMP BLACKBIRD REDWINGED ORIOLE REDWINGED
 STARLING

Length  Exceptionally variable750 to 980 inches Usually
 about an inch smaller than the robin
Male  Coalblack Shoulders scarlet edged with yellow
Female  Feathers finely and inconspicuously speckled with
 brown rusty black whitish and orange Upper wingcoverts
 black tipped with white or rufous and sometimes spotted with
 black and red
Range  North America Breeds from Texas to Columbia River and
 throughout the United States Commonly found from Mexico to
 57th degree north latitude
Migrations  March October Common summer resident

In oozy pastures where a brook lazily finds its way through the farm is the
ideal pleasure ground of this bird of society His notes hwakeree or
conqueree on an ascending scale are liquid in quality suggesting the
sweet moist cool retreats where he nests Liking either heat or cold he is
fond of wintering in Florida but often retreats to the north while the
marshes are still frozen enjoying not only the company of large flocks of
his own kind with whom he travels but any bird associates with whom he can
scrape acquaintance or to sit quietly on a treetop in the secluded
inaccessible bog while his mate is nesting satisfied with cutworms grubs
and insects or with fruit and grain for his food  the blackbird is an
impressive and helpful example of how to get the best out of life

Yet of all the birds some farmers complain that the blackbird is the
greatest nuisance They dislike the noisy chatterings when a flock is simply
indulging its social instincts They complain too that the blackbirds eat
their corn forgetting that having devoured innumerable grubs from it during
the summer the birds feel justly entitled to a share of the profits Though
occasionally guilty of eating the farmers corn and oats and rice yet it has
been found that nearly seveneighths of the redwings food is made up of
weedseeds or of insects injurious to agriculture This bird builds its nest
in low bushes on the margin of ponds or low in the bog grass of marshes From
three to five paleblue eggs curiously streaked spotted and scrawled with

PURPLE MARTIN Progne subis Swallow family

Length  7 to 8 inches Two or three inches smaller than the
 robin
Male  Rich glossy black with bluish and purple reflections
 duller black on wings and tail Wings rather longer than the
 tail which is forked
Female  More brownish and mottled grayish below
Range  Peculiar to America Penetrates from Arctic Circle to
 South America
Migrations  Late April Early September Summer resident

In oldfashioned gardens set on a pole over which honeysuckle and roses
climbed from a bed where China pinks phlox sweet Williams and hollyhocks
crowded each other below martin boxes used always to be seen with a pair of
these large beautiful swallows circling overhead Bur now alas the boxes
where set up at all are quickly monopolized by the English sparrow a bird
that the martin courageous as a kingbird in attacking crows and hawks
tolerates as a neighbor only when it must

Bradford Torrey tells of seeing quantities of longnecked squashes dangling
from poles about the negro cabins all through the South One day he asked an
old colored man what these squashes were for

Why deh is martins boxes said Uncle Remus No danger of hawks carryin
off de chickens so long as de martins am around

The Indians too have always had a special liking for this bird They often
lined a hollowedout gourd with bits of bark and fastened it in the crotch of
their tent poles to invite its friendship The Mohegan Indians have called it
the bird that never restsa name better suited to the tireless barn
swallow Dr Abbott thinks

Wasps beetles and all manner of injurious garden insects constitute its diet
 another reason for its universal popularity It is simple enough to
distinguish the martins from the other swallows by their larger size and
iridescent dark coat not to mention their song which is very soft and sweet
like musical laughter rippling up through the throat


COWBIRD Molothrus ater Blackbird family

Called also BROWNHEADED ORIOLE COWPEN BIRD COW BLACKBIRD
 COW BUNTING BROWNHEADED COWBIRD AOU 1998

Length  7 to 8 inches About onefifth smaller than the robin
Male  Iridescent black with head neck and breast glistening
 brown Bill dark brown feet brownish
Female  Dull grayishbrown above a shade lighter below and
 streaked with paler shades of brown
Range  United States from coast to coast North into British
 America south into Mexico
Migrations  March November Common summer resident

The cowbird takes its name from its habit of walking about among the cattle in
the pasture picking up the small insects which the cattle disturb in their
grazing The bird may often be seen within a foot or two of the nose of a cow
or heifer walking briskly about like a miniature hen intently watching for
its insect prey

Its marital and domestic character is thoroughly bad Polygamous and utterly
irresponsible for its offspring this bird forms a striking contrast to other
feathered neighbors and indeed is almost an anomaly in the animal kingdom In
the breeding season an unnatural mother may be seen skulking about in the
trees and shrubbery seeking for nests in which to place a surreptitious egg
never imposing it upon a bird of its size but selecting in a cowardly way a
small nest as that of the vireos or warblers or chipping sparrows and there
leaving the hatching and care of its young to the tender mercies of some
already burdened little mother It has been seen to remove an egg from the
nest of the redeyed vireo in order to place one of its own in its place Not
finding a convenient nest it will even drop its eggs on the ground trusting
them to merciless fate or still worse devouring them The eggs are nearly
an inch long white speckled with brown or gray

Cowbirds are gregarious The ungrateful young birds as soon as they are able
to go roaming leave their fosterparents and join the flock of their own
kind In keeping with its unclean habits and unholy life and character the
cowbirds ordinary note is a gurgling rasping whistle followed by a few
sharp notes


STARLING Sturnus vulgaris

Called also EUROPEAN STARLING AOU 1998

Length  8 to 9 inches Weight about equals that of robin but
 the starling with its short drooping tail is chunkier in
 appearance
Male  Iridescent black with glints of purple green and blue
 On back the black feathers with iridescence of green and
 bronze are tipped with brown as are some of the tail and wing
 feathers In autumn and early winter feathers of sides of head
 breast flanks and underparts are tipped with white giving a
 gray mottled appearance During the winter most of the white
 tips on breast and underparts wear off Until the first moult
 in late summer the young birds are a dark olivebrown in color
 with white or whitish throat These differences in plumage at
 different seasons and different ages make starlings hard to
 identify Redwinged blackbirds and grackles are often mistaken
 for them From early spring till midJune starlings rather
 long sharp bill is yellow Later in summer it darkens No
 other black bird of ours has this yellow bill at any season
Female  Similar in appearance
Range  Massachusetts to Maryland Not common beyond 100 miles
 inland Native of northern Europe and Asia
Migrations  Permanent resident but flocks show some tendency
 to drift southward in winter

This newcomer to our shores is by no means so black as he has been painted
Like many other European immigrants he landed at or near Castle Garden New
York City and his descendants have not cared to wander very far from this
vicinity preferring regions with a pretty numerous human population The
starlings have increased so fast in this limited region since their first
permanent settlement in Central Park about 1890 that farmers and suburban
dwellers have feared that they might become as undesirable citizens as some
other Europeans  the brown rat the house mouse and the English sparrow
But a very thorough investigation conducted by the United States Bureau of
Biological Survey Bulletin No 868 1921 is most reassuring in its results

Let us first state the case for the prosecution 1 the starling must plead
guilty to a fondness for cultivated cherries 2 he is often a persecutor of
native birds like the bluebird and flicker 3 his roosts where he
sometimes congregates in thousands in the autumn are apt to become public
nuisances offensive alike to the eye the nose and the ear

But these offences are not so very serious after all He does not eat so many
cherries as our old friend the robin though his depredations are more
conspicuous for whereas the robins in ones and twos will pilfer steadily from
many trees for many days without attracting notice a crowd of starlings is
occasionally observed to descend en masse upon a single tree and strip it in a
few hours Naturally such highhanded procedure is observed by many and deeply
resented by the owner of the tree who suffers the steady but less spectacular
raids of the robins without serious disquiet

Less can be said in defense of the starlings scandalous treatment of some
native birds Unrelenting perseverance dominates the starlings activities
when engaged in a controversy over a nesting site More of its battles are won
by dogged persistence in annoying its victim than by bold aggression and its
irritating tactics are sometimes carried to such a point that it seems almost
as if the bird were actuated more by a morbid pleasure of annoying its
neighbors than by any necessity arising from a scarcity of nesting sites

In contests with the flicker the starling frequently makes up in numbers what
disadvantage it may have in size Typical of such combats was the one observed
on May 9 at Hartford Conn where a group of starlings and a flicker were in
controversy over a newly excavated nest The number of starlings varied but
as many as 6 were noted at one time Attention was first attracted to the
dispute by a number of starlings in close proximity to the hole and by the
sounds of a tussle within Presently a flicker came out dragging a starling
after him The starling continued the battle outside long enough to allow one
of its comrades to slip into the nest Of course the flicker had to repeat the
entire performance He did this for about half an hour when he gave up
leaving the starlings in possession of the nest

Economically considered the starling is the superior of either the flicker
the robin or the English sparrow three of the species with which it comes in
contact in its breeding operations The eggs and young of bluebirds and wrens
may be protected by the use of nest boxes with circular openings 1 12 inches
or less in diameter This leaves the purple martin the only species readily
subject to attack by the starling whose economic worth may be considered
greater than that of the latter but in no case was the disturbance of a
wellestablished colony of martins noted

As for the nuisance of a big established roost of starlings it may be abated
by nightly salvos of Roman candles or blank cartridges continued for a week
or at most ten days

So much for the starling in his aspect as an undesirable citizen Government
investigators by a longcontinued study have discovered that his good deeds
far outnumber his misdemeanors Primarily he feeds on noxious insects and
useless wild fruits Small truck gardens and individual cherry trees may be
occasionally raided by large flocks with disastrous results in a small way
But on the whole he is a useful frequenter of our dooryards who pays his way
by destroying hosts of cutworms and equally noxious insects A thorough
consideration of the evidence at hand indicates that based on food habits
the adult starling is the economic superior of the robin catbird flicker
redwinged blackbird or grackle Need more be said for him

BIRDS CONSPICUOUSLY BLACK AND WHITE


REDHEADED WOODPECKER Melanerpes erythrocephalus Woodpecker
 family

Called also TRICOLOR REDHEAD

Length  850 to 975 inches An inch or less smaller than the
 robin
Male and Female  Head neck and throat crimson breast and
 underneath white back black and white wings and tail blue
 black with broad white band on wings conspicuous in flight
Range  United States east of Rocky Mountains and north to
 Manitoba
Migrations  Abundant but irregular migrant Most commonly seen
 in Autumn and rarely resident

In thinly populated sections where there are few guns about this is still
one of the commonest as it is perhaps the most conspicuous member of the
woodpecker family but its striking glossy blackandwhite body and its still
more striking crimson head flattened out against the side of a tree like a
target where it is feeding have made it all too tempting a mark for the
rifles of the sportsmen and the slingshots of small boys As if sufficient
attention were not attracted to it by its plumage it must needs keep up a
noisy guttural rattle kerrruck
kerrruck very like a treetoads call and flit about among the trees with
the restlessness of a flycatcher Yet in spite of these invitations for a
shot to the passing gunner it still multiplies in districts where nuts
abound being more common than the robin about Washington says John
Burroughs

All the familiar woodpeckers have two characteristics most prominently
exemplified in this redheaded member of their tribe The hairy the downy
the crested the redbellied the sapsucker and the flicker have each a red
mark somewhere about their heads as if they had been wounded there and bled a
little  some more some less and the figures of all of them from much
flattening against treetrunks have become highshouldered and longwaisted

The redheaded woodpecker selects by preference a partly decayed tree in
which to excavate a hole for its nest because the digging is easier and the
sawdust and chips make a softer lining than green wood Both male and female
take turns in this hollowingout process The one that is off duty is allowed
twenty minutes for refreshments consisting of grubs beetles ripe apples or
cherries corn or preferably beechnuts At a loving call from its mate in
the hollow tree it returns promptly to perform its share of the work when
the carefully observed time is up The heap of sawdust at the bottom of the
hollow will eventually cradle from four to six glossywhite eggs

This woodpecker has the thrifty habit of storing away nuts in the knotholes
of trees between cracks in the bark or in decayed fence railstoo often a
convenient storehouse at which the squirrels may help themselves But it is
the black snake that enters the nest and eats the young family and that is a
more deadly foe than even the sportsman or the milliner


HAIRY WOODPECKER Dryobates villosus Woodpecker family

Length9 to 10 inches About the size of the robin
MaleBlack and white above white beneath White stripe down the
 back composed of long hairlike feathers Brightred band on
 the nape of neck Wings striped and dashed with black and
 white Outer tail feathers white without bars White stripe
 about eyes and on sides of the head
FemaleWithout the red band on head and body more brownish than
 that of the male
RangeEastern parts of United States from the Canadian border
 to the Carolinas
MigrationsResident throughout its range

The bill of the woodpecker is a hammering tool well fitted for its work Its
mission in life is to rid the trees of insects which hide beneath the bark
and with this end in view the bird is seen clinging to the trunks and
branches of trees through fair and wintry weather industriously scanning
every inch for the wellknown signs of the boring worm or destructive fly

In the autumn the male begins to excavate his winter quarters carrying or
throwing out the chips by which this good workman is known with his beak
while the female may make herself cosey or not as she chooses in an
abandoned hole About her comfort he seems shamefully unconcerned Intent only
on his own he drills a perfectly round hole usually on the underside of a
limb where neither snow nor wind can harm him and digs out a horizontal
tunnel in the dry brittle wood in the very heart of the tree before turning
downward into the deep pearshaped chamber where he lives in selfish
solitude But when the nesting season comes how devoted he is temporarily to
the mate he has neglected and even abused through the winter Will she never
learn that after her clearwhite eggs are laid and her brood raised he will
relapse into the savage and forget all his tender wiles

The hairy woodpecker like many another bird and beast furnishes much
doubtful weather lore for credulous and inexact observers When the
woodpecker pecks low on the trees expect warm weather is a common saying
but when different individuals are seen pecking at the same time one but a
few feet from the ground and another among the high branches one may make
the prophecy that pleases him best

The hairy woodpeckers love the deep woods They are drummers not singers but
when walking in the desolate winter woods even the drumming and tapping of the
busy feathered workmen on a resonant limb is a solace giving a sense of life
and cheerful activity which is invigorating


DOWNY WOODPECKER Dryobates pubescens Woodpecker family

Length  6 to 7 inches About the size of the English sparrow
Male  Black above striped with white Tail shaped like a wedge
 Outer tail feathers white and barred with black Middle tail
 feathers black A black stripe on top of head and distinct
 white band over and under the eyes Red patch on upper side of
 neck Wings with six white bands crossing them transversely
 white underneath
Female  Similar but without scarlet on the nape which is
 white
Range  Eastern North America from Labrador to Florida
Migrations  Resident all the year throughout its range

The downy woodpecker is similar to his big relative the hairy woodpecker in
color and shape though much smaller His outer tail feathers are white
barred with black but the hairys white outer tail feathers lack these
distinguishing marks

He is often called a sapsucker  though quite another bird alone merits that
name  from the supposition that he bores into the trees for the purpose of
sucking the sap but his tongue is ill adapted for such use being barbed at
the end and most ornithologists consider the charge libellous It has been
surmised that he bores the numerous little round holes close together so
often seen with the idea of attracting insects to the luscious sap The
woodpeckers never drill for insects in live wood The downy actually drills
these little holes in apple and other trees to feed upon the inner milky bark
of the tree  the cambium layer The only harm to be laid to his account is
that in his zeal he sometimes makes a ring of small holes so continuous as
to inadvertently damage the tree by girdling it The bird like most others
does not debar himself entirely from fruit diet but enjoys berries
especially pokeberries

He is very social with birds and men alike In winter he attaches himself to
strolling bands of nuthatches and chickadees and in summer is fond of making
friendly visits among village folk frequenting the shade trees of the streets
and grapevines of back gardens He has even been known to fearlessly peck at
flies on window panes

In contrast to his large brother woodpecker who is seldom drawn from timber
lands the little downy member of the family brings the comfort of his cheery
presence to country homes beating his rolling tattoo in spring on some
resonant limb under our windows in the garden with a strength worthy of a
larger drummer

This rolling tattoo or drumming answers several purposes by it he
determines whether the tree is green or hollow it startles insects from their
lurking places underneath the bark and it also serves as a love song


YELLOWBELLIED WOODPECKER Sphyrapicus varius Woodpecker family

Called also THE SAPSUCKER YELLOWBELLIED SAPSUCKER AOU 1998

Length  8 to 86 inches About onefifth smaller than the
 robin
Male  Black white and yellowish white above with brightred
 crown chin and throat Breast black in form of crescent A
 yellowishwhite line beginning at bill and passing below eye
 merges into the pale yellow of the bird underneath Wings
 spotted with white and coverts chiefly white Tail black
 white on middle of feathers
Female  Paler and with head and throat white
Range  Eastern North America from Labrador to Central America
Migrations  April October Resident north of Massachusetts
 Most common in autumn

It is sad to record that this exquisitely marked woodpecker the most jovial
and boisterous of its family is one of the very few bird visitors whose
intimacy should be discouraged For its useful appetite for slugs and insects
which it can take on the wing with wonderful dexterity it need not be wholly
condemned But as we look upon a favorite maple or fruit tree devitalized or
perhaps wholly dead from its ravages we cannot forget that this bird while a
most abstemious fruiteater has a pernicious and most intemperate thirst for
sap Indeed it spends much of its time in the orchard drilling holes into
the freshest most vigorous trees then when their sap begins to flow it
siphons it into an insatiable throat stopping in its orgie only long enough
to snap at the insects that have been attracted to the wounded tree by the
streams of its heartblood now trickling down its sides Another favorite
pastime is to strip the bark off a tree then peck at the soft wood underneath
 almost as fatal a habit It drills holes in maples in early spring for sap
only If it drills holes in fruit trees it is for the cambium layer a soft
pulpy nutritious underbark

These woodpeckers have a variety of callnotes but their rapid drumming
against the limbs and trunks of trees is the sound we always associate with
them and the sound that Mr Bicknell says is the lovenote of the family

Unhappily these birds that many would be glad to have decrease in numbers
take extra precautions for the safety of their young by making very deep
excavations for their nests often as deep as eighteen or twenty inches


THE CHEWINK Pipilo erythrophthalmus Finch family

Called also GROUND ROBIN TOWHEE TOWHEE BUNTING TOWHEE GROUND
FINCH GRASEL EASTERN TOWHEE AOU 1998

Length  8 to 85 inches About onefifth smaller than the
 robin
Male  Upper parts black sometimes margined with rufous Breast
 white chestnut color on sides and rump Wings marked with
 white Three outer feathers of tail striped with white
 conspicuous in flight Bill black and stout Red eyes feet
 brown
Female  Brownish where the male is black Abdomen shading from
 chestnut to white in the centre
Range  From Labrador on the north to the Southern States
 West to the Rocky Mountains
Migrations  April September and October Summer resident Very
 rarely a winter resident at the north

The unobtrusive little chewink is not infrequently mistaken for a robin
because of the reddish chestnut on its under parts Careful observation
however shows important distinctions It is rather smaller and darker in
color its carriage and form are not those of the robin but of the finch The
female is smaller still and has an olive tint in her brown back Her eggs are
inconspicuous in color dirty white speckled with brown and laid in a sunken
nest on the ground Dead leaves and twigs abound and form as the anxious
mother fondly hopes a safe hiding place for her brood So careful
concealment however brings peril to the fledglings for the most cautious
birdlover may and often does inadvertently set his foot on the hidden nest

The chewink derives its name from the fancied resemblance of its note to these
syllables while those naming it towhee hear the sound towhick towhick
towhee Its song is rich full and pleasing and given only when the bird
has risen to the branches above its low foraging ground

It frequents the border of swampy places and bushy fields It is generally
seen in the underbrush picking about among the dead leaves for its steady
diet of earthworms and larvae of insects occasionally regaling itself with a
few dropping berries and fruit

When startled the bird rises not more than ten or twelve feet from the earth
and utters its characteristic calls On account of this habit of flying low
and grubbing among the leaves it is sometimes called the ground robin In the
South our modest and useful little foodgatherer is often called grasel
especially in Louisiana where it is whiteeyed and is much esteemed alas
by epicures


SNOWFLAKE Plectrophenax nivalis Finch family

Called also SNOW BUNTING AOU 1998 WHITEBIRD SNOWBIRD SNOW
 LARK

Length  7 to 75 inches About onefourth smaller than the
 robin
Male and Female  Head neck and beneath soiled white with a
 few reddishbrown feathers on top of head and suggesting an
 imperfect collar Above grayish brown obsoletely streaked with
 black the markings being most conspicuous in a band between
 shoulders Lower tail feathers black others white and all
 edged with white Wings brown white and gray Plumage
 unusually variable In summer dress in arctic regions the
 bird is almost white
Range  Circumpolar regions to Kentucky in winter only
Migrations  Midwinter visitor rarely if ever resident south
 of arctic regions

These snowflakes mentioned collectively for it is impossible to think of the
bird except in great flocks are the true spirits of the snowstorm says
Thoreau They are animated beings that ride upon it and have their life in
it By comparison with the climate of the arctic regions no doubt our
hardiest winter weather seems luxuriously mild to them We associate them only
with those wonderful midwinter days when sky fields and woods alike are
white and a hard dull bitterness of cold drives every other bird and beast
to shelter It is said they often pass the night buried beneath the snow They
have been seen to dive beneath it to escape a hawk

Whirling about in the drifting snow to catch the seeds on the tallest stalks
that the wind in the open meadows uncovers the snowflakes suggest a lot of
dead leaves being blown through the allpervading whiteness Beautiful soft
brown gray and predominating blackandwhite coloring distinguish these
capricious visitors from the slaty junco the snowbird more commonly known
They are indeed the only birds we have that are nearly white and rarely if
ever do they rise far above the ground their plumage so admirably imitates

At the far north travellers have mentioned their inspiriting song but in the
United States we hear only their cheerful twitter Nansen tells of seeing an
occasional snow bunting in that desolation of arctic ice where the Fram
drifted so long


ROSEBREASTED GROSBEAK Habia ludoviciana Finch family

Length  775 to 85 inches About onefifth smaller than the
 robin
Male  Head and upper parts black Breast has rosecarmine
 shieldshaped patch often extending downward to the centre of
 the abdomen Underneath tail quills and two spots on wings
 white Conspicuous yellow blunt beak
Female  Brownish with dark streakings like a sparrow No
 rosecolor Light sulphur yellow under wings Dark brown heavy
 beak
Range  Eastern North America from southern Canada to Panama
Migrations  Early May September Summer resident

A certain ornithologist tells with complacent pride of having shot over
fiftyeight rosebreasted grosbeaks in less than three weeks during the
breeding season to learn what kind of food they had in their crops This kind
of devotion to science may have quite as much to do with the growing scarcity
of this bird in some localities as the demands of the milliners who however
receive all of the blame for the slaughter of our beautiful songsters The
farmers in Pennsylvania who with more truth than poetry call this the
potatobug bird are taking active measures however to protect the neighbor
that is more useful to their crop than all the insecticides known It also
eats flies wasps and grubs

Seen upon the ground the dark bird is scarcely attractive with his clumsy
beak overbalancing a head that protrudes with stupidlooking awkwardness but
as he rises into the trees his lovely rosecolored breast and underwing
feathers are seen and before he has had time to repeat his delicious
richvoiced warble you are already in love with him Vibrating his wings after
the manner of the mockingbird he pours forth a marvellously sweet clear
mellow song with something of the quality of the orioles robins and
thrushs notes making the day on which you first hear it memorable This is
one of the few birds that sing at night A soft sweet rolling warble heard
when the moon is at its full on a midsummer night is more than likely to come
from the rosebreasted grosbeak

It is not that his quiet little sparrowlike wife has advanced notions of
feminine independence that he takes his turn at sitting upon the nest but
that he is one of the most unselfish and devoted of mates With their combined
efforts they construct only a coarse unlovely cradle in a thornbush or low
tree near an old overgrown pasture lot The father may be the poorest of
architects but as he patiently sits brooding over the green speckled eggs
his beautiful rosy breast just showing above the grassy rim he is a succulent
adornment for any birds home


BOBOLINK Dolichonyx oryzivorus Blackbird family

Called alsoREEDBIRD MAYBIRD MEADOWBIRD AMERICAN ORTOLAN
 BUTTERBIRD SKUNK BLACKBIRD

Length  7 inches A trifle larger than the English sparrow
Male  In spring plumage black with lightyellow patch on
 upper neck also on edges of wings and tail feathers Rump and
 upper wings splashed with white Middle of back streaked with
 pale buff Tail feathers have pointed tips In autumn plumage
 resembles female
Female  Dull yellowbrown with light and dark dashes on back
 wings and tail Two decided dark stripes on top of head
Range  North America from eastern coast to western prairies
 Migrates in early autumn to Southern States and in winter to
 South America and West Indies
Migrations  Early May From August to October Common summer
 resident

Perhaps none of our birds have so fitted into song and story as the bobolink
Unlike a good child who should be seen and not heard he is heard more
frequently than seen Very shy of peering eyes he keeps well out of sight in
the meadow grass before entrancing our listening ears The bobolink never
soars like the lark as the poets would have us believe but generally sings
on the wing flying with a peculiar selfconscious flight horizontally thirty
or forty feet above the meadow grass He also sings perched upon the fence or
tuft of grass He is one of the greatest poseurs among the birds

In spring and early summer the bobolinks respond to every poets effort to
imitate their notes Dignified Robert of Lincoln is telling his name says
one Spink spank spink another hears him say But best of all are Wilson
Flaggs lines

   Now they rise and now they fly
 They cross and turn and in and out and down the middle and
 wheel about
 With a Phew shew Wadolincon listen to me Bobolincon

After midsummer the cares of the family have so worn upon the jollity of our
dashing rollicking friend that his song is seldom heard The colors of his
coat fade into a dull yellowish brown like that of his faithful mate who has
borne the greater burden of the season for he has two complete moults each
year

The bobolinks build their nest on the ground in high grass The eggs are of a
bluish white Their food is largely insectivorous grasshoppers crickets
beetles spiders with seeds of grass especially for variety

In August they begin their journey southward flying mainly by night Arriving
in the Southern States they become the
sadcolored lowvoiced rice or reed bird feeding on the rice fields where
they descend to the ignominious fate of being dressed for the plate of the
epicure

Could there be a more tragic ending to the glorious note of the gay songster
of the north


BLACKPOLL WARBLER Dendroica striata Wood Warbler family

Length  55 to 6 inches About an inch smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Black cap cheeks and beneath grayish white forming a
 sort of collar more or less distinct Upper parts striped
 gray black and olive Breast and under parts white with
 black streaks Tail olivebrown with yellowwhite spots
Female  Without cap Greenisholive above faintly streaked
 with black Paler than male Bands on wings yellowish
Range  North America to Greenland and Alaska In winter to
 northern part of South America
Migrations  Last of May Late October

A faint screep screep like the noise made by striking two pebbles
together Audubon says is often the only indication of the blackpolls
presence but surely that tireless birdstudent had heard its more
characteristic notes which rapidly uttered increasing in the middle of the
strain and diminishing toward the end suggest the shrill wiry burn of some
midsummer insect After the operaglass has searched him out we find him by no
means an inconspicuous bird A dainty little fellow with a glossy black cap
pulled over his eyes he is almost hidden by the dense foliage on the trees by
the time he returns to us at the very end of spring Giraud says that he is
the very last of his tribe to come north though the baybreasted warbler has
usually been thought the bird to wind up the spring procession

The blackpoll has a certain characteristic motion that distinguishes him from
the blackandwhite creeper for which a hasty glance might mistake him and
from the jolly little chickadee with his black cap Apparently he runs about
the treetrunk but in reality he so flits his wings that his feet do not
touch the bark at all yet so rapidly does he go that the flipping wingmotion
is not observed He is most often seen in May in the apple trees peeping into
the opening blossoms for insects uttering now and then his slender lisping
brief song

Vivacious a busy hunter often catching insects on the wing like the
flycatchers he is a cheerful useful neighbor the short time he spends with
us before travelling to the far north where he mates and nests A nest has
been found on Slide Mountain in the Catskills but the hardy evergreens of
Canada and sometimes those of northern New England are the chosen home of
this little bird that builds a nest of bits of root lichens and sedges
amply large for a family twice the size of his

Male  Upper parts white varied with black A white stripe
 along the summit of the head and back of the neck edged
 with black White line above and below the eye Black cheeks
 and throat grayish in females and young Breast white in
 middle with black stripes on sides Wings and tail rusty
 black with two white crossbars on former and soiled white
 markings on tail quills
Female  Paler and less distinct markings throughout
Range  Peculiar to America Eastern United States and westward
 to the plains North as far as the fur countries Winters in
 tropics south of Florida
Migrations  April Late September Summer resident

Nine times out of ten this active little warbler is mistaken for the downy
woodpecker not because of his coloring alone but also on account of their
common habit of running up and down the trunks of trees and on the under side
of branches looking for insects on which all the warblers subsist But
presently the true warbler characteristic of restless flitting about shows
itself A woodpecker would go over a tree with painstaking systematic care
while the blackandwhite warbler no less intent upon securing its food
hurries off from tree to tree wherever the most promising menu is offered

Clinging to the mottled bark of the treetrunk which he so closely resembles
it would be difficult to find him were it not for these sudden fittings and
the feeble song Weachy weachy weachy twee twee tweet he half
lisps half sings between his dashes after slugs Very rarely indeed can his
nest be found in an old stump or mossy bank where bark leaves and hair make
the downy cradle for his four or five tiny babies

The chimney swift is properly speaking not a swallow at all though chimney
swallow is its more popular name Rowing towards the roof of your house as if
it used first one wing then the other its flight while swift and powerful
is stiff and mechanical unlike the swallows and its entire aspect suggests
a bat The nighthawk and whippoorwill are its relatives and it resembles them
not a little especially in its nocturnal habits

So much fault has been found with the misleading names of many birds it is
pleasant to record the fact that the name of the chimney swift is everything
it ought to be No other birds can surpass and few can equal it in its
powerful flight sometimes covering a thousand miles in twentyfour hours it
is said and never resting except in its roosting places hollow trees or
chimneys of dwellings where it does not perch but rather clings to the
sides with its sharp claws partly supported by its sharper tail Audubon
tells of a certain plane tree in Kentucky where he counted over nine thousand
of these swifts clinging to the hollow trunk

Their nest which is a loosely woven twig lattice made of twigs of trees
which the birds snap off with their beaks and carry in their beaks is glued
with the birds saliva or treegum into a solid structure and firmly attached
to the inside of chimneys or hollow trees where there are no houses about
Two broods in a season usually emerge from the pure white elongated eggs

What a twittering there is in the chimney that the swifts appropriate after
the winter fires have died out Instead of the hospitable column of smoke
curling from the top a cloud of sooty birds wheels and floats above it A
sound as of distant thunder fills the chimney as a host of these birds
startled perhaps by some indoor noise whirl their way upward Woe betide
the happy colony if a sudden cold snap in early summer necessitates the
starting of a fire on the hearth by the unsuspecting householder The glue
being melted by the fire down comes the cradle babies and all into the
glowing embers A prolonged heavy rain also causes their nests to loosen
their hold and fall with the soot to the bottom

Thrifty New England housekeepers claim that bedbugs commonly found on bats
infest the bodies of swifts also which is one reason why wire netting is
stretched across the chimney tops before the birds arrive from the South


KINGBIRD Tyrannus tyrannus Flycatcher family

Called also TYRANT FLYCATCHER BEE MARTIN EASTERN KINGBIRD
 AOU 1998

Length  8 inches About two inches shorter than the robin
Male  Ashy black above white shaded with ashcolor beneath
 A concealed crest of orangered on crown Tail black
 Terminating with a white band conspicuous in flight Wing
 feathers edged with white Feet and bill black
Female  Similar to the male but lacking the crown
Range  United States to the Rocky Mountains British provinces
 To Central and South America
Migrations  May September Common summer resident

If the pugnacious propensity of the kingbird is the occasion of its royal
name he cannot be said to deserve it from any fine or noble qualities he
possesses He is a born fighter from the very love of it without provocation
rhyme or reason One can but watch with a degree of admiration his bold
sallies on the big black crow or the marauding hawk but when he bullies the
small inoffensive birds in wanton attacks for sheer amusement the charge is
less entertaining Occasionally when the little victim shows pluck and faces
his assailant the kingbird will literally turn tail and show the white
feather His method of attack is always when a bird is in flight then he
swoops down from the telegraph pole or high point of vantage and strikes on
the head or back of the neck darting back like a flash to the exact spot from
which he started By these tactics he avoids a return blow and retreats from
danger He never makes a fair handtohand fight or whatever is equivalent in
bird warfare It is a satisfaction to record that he does not attempt to give
battle to the catbird but whenever in view makes a grand detour to give him a
wide berth

The kingbird feeds on beetles cankerworms and winged insects with an
occasional dessert of berries He is popularly supposed to prefer the honeybee
as his favorite tidbit but the weight of opinion is adverse to the charge of
his depopulating the beehive even though he owes his appellation bee martin
to this tradition One or two ornithologists declare that he selects only the
drones fur his diet which would give him credit for marvellous sight in his
rapid motion through the air The kingbird is preeminently a bird of the
garden and orchard The nest is open though deep and not carefully
concealed Eggs are nearly round bluish white spotted with brown and lilac
With truly royal exclusiveness the tyrant favors no community of interest
but sits in regal state on a conspicuous throne and takes his grand flights
alone or with his queen but never with a flock of his kind


WOOD PEWEE Contopus virens Flycatcher family

Length  650 inches A trifle larger than the English sparrow
Male  Dusky brownish olive above darkest on head paler on
 throat lighter still underneath and with a yellowish tinge on
 the dusky gray under parts Dusky wings and tail the wing
 coverts tipped with soiled white forming two indistinct bars
 Whitish eyering Wings longer than tail
Female  Similar but slightly more buff underneath
Range  Eastern North America from Florida to northern British
 provinces Winters in Central America
Migrations  May October Common summer resident

The wood pewee like the olivesided flycatcher has wings decidedly longer
than its tail and it is by no means a simple matter for the novice to tell
these birds apart or separate them distinctly in the mind from the other
members of a family whose coloring and habits are most confusingly similar
This dusky haunter of tall shady trees has not yet learned to be sociable like
the phoebe but while it may not be so much in evidence close to our homes it
is doubtless just as common The orchard is as near the house as it often
cares to come An old orchard where modern insecticides are unknown and
neglect allows insects to riot among the decayed bark and fallen fruit is a
happy hunting ground enough but the birds real preferences are decidedly for
high treetops in the woods where no sunshine touches the feathers on his
dusky coat It is one of the few shadeloving birds In deep solitudes where
it surely retreats by nesting time however neighborly it may be during the
migrations its pensive pathetic notes long drawn out seem like the
expression of some hidden sorrow Peawee peawee peweeahpeer is the
burden of its plaintive song a sound as depressing as it is familiar in every
walk through the woods and the birds most prominent characteristic

To see the bird dashing about in his aerial chase for insects no one would
accuse him of melancholia He keeps an eye on the main chance whatever his
preying grief may be and never allows it to affect his appetite Returning to
his perch after a successful sally in pursuit of the passing fly he repeats
his sweetly solemn thought over and over again all day long and every day
throughout the summer

The wood pewees show that devotion to each other and to their home
characteristic of their family Both lovers work on the construction of the
flat nest that is saddled on some mossy or lichencovered limb and so
cleverly do they cover the rounded edge with bits of bark and lichen that
sharp eyes only can detect where the cradle lies Creamywhite eggs whose
larger end is wreathed with brown and lilac spots are guarded with fierce
solicitude

Trowbridge has celebrated this bird in a beautiful poem


PHOEBE Sayornis phoebe Flycatcher family

Called also DUSKY FLYCATCHER BRIDGE PEWEE WATER PEWEE
 EASTERN PHOEBE AOU 1998

Length  7 inches About an inch longer than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Dusky olive  brown above darkest on head
 Which is slightly crested Wings and tail dusky the outer
 edges of some tail feathers whitish Dingy yellowish white
 underneath Bill and feet black
Range  North America from Newfoundland to the South Atlantic
 States and westward to the Rockies Winters south of the
 Carolinas into Mexico Central America and the West Indies
Migrations  March October Common summer resident

The earliest representative of the flycatcher family to come out of the
tropics where insect life fairly swarms and teems what does the friendly
little phoebe find to attract him to the north in March while his prospective
dinners must all be still in embryo He looks dejected it is true as he sits
solitary and silent on some projecting bare limb in the garden awaiting the
coming of his tardy mate nevertheless the date of his return will not vary
by more than a few days in a given locality year after year Why birds that
are mated for life as these are said to be and such devoted lovers should
not travel together on their journey north is another of the many mysteries
of birdlife awaiting solution

The reunited happy couple go about the garden and outbuildings like
domesticated wrens investigating the crannies on piazzas where people may be
coming and going and boldly entering barnlofts to find a suitable site for
the nest that it must take much of both time and skill to build

Pewit phoebe phoebe pewit phoebe they contentedly but rather monotonously
sing as they investigate all the sites in the neighborhood Presently a
location is chosen under a beam or rafter and the work of collecting moss and
mud for the foundation and hair and feathers or wool to line the exquisite
little home begins But the labor is done cheerfully with many a sally in
midair either to let off superfluous high spirits or to catch a morsel on the
wing and with many a vivacious outburst of what by courtesy only we may name
a song

When not domesticated as these birds are rapidly becoming the phoebes dearly
love a cool wet woodland retreat Here they hunt and bathe here they also
build in a rocky bank or ledge of rocks or underneath a bridge but always
with clever adaptation of their nest to its surroundings out of which it
seems a natural growth It is one of the most finished beautiful nests ever
found

A pair of phoebes become attached to a spot where they have once nested they
never stray far from it and return to it regularly though they may not again
occupy the old nest This is because it soon becomes infested with lice from
the hens feathers used in lining it for which reason too close relationship
with this friendly birdneighbor is discouraged by thrifty housekeepers When
the baby birds have come out from the four or six little white eggs their
helpless bodies are mercilessly attacked by parasites and are often so
enfeebled that half the brood die The next season another nest will be built
near the first the following summer still another until it would appear that
a colony of birds had made their homes in the place

Throughout the long summer  for as the phoebe is the first flycatcher to
come so it is the last to go  the bird is a tireless hunter of insects
which it catches on the wing with a sharp click of its beak like the other
members of its dexterous family

Says Phoebe Sayornis saya is the Western representative of the Eastern
species which it resembles in coloring and many of its habits It is the bird
of the open plains a tireless hunter in midair sallies from an isolated
perch and has the same vibrating motion of the tail that the Eastern phoebe
indulges in when excited This bird differs chiefly in its lighter coloring
but not in habits from the black pewee of the Pacific slope

The most dignified and handsomely dressed member of his family the crested
flycatcher has nevertheless an air of pensive melancholy about him when in
repose that can be accounted for only by the pain he must feel every time he
hears himself screech His harsh shrill call louder and more disagreeable
than the kingbirds cannot but rasp his ears as it does ours And yet it is
chiefly by this piercing note given with a rising inflection that we know
the bird is in our neighborhood for he is somewhat of a recluse and we must
often follow the disagreeable noise to its source in the treetops before we
can catch a glimpse of the screecher Perched on a high lookout he appears
morose and sluggish in spite of his aristocraticlooking crest trim figure
and feathers that must seem rather gay to one of his dusky tribe A low
soliloquy apparently born of discontent can be overheard from the foot of
his tree But another second and he has dashed off in hot pursuit of an
insect flying beyond our sight and with extremely quick dexterous evolutions
in midair he finishes the hunt with a sharp click of his bill as it closes
over the unhappy victim and then he returns to his perch On the wing he is
exceedingly active and joyous in the tree he appears just the reverse That
he is a domineering fellow quite as much of a tyrant as the notorious
kingbird that bears the greater burden of opprobrium is shown in the fierce
way he promptly dashes at a feathered stranger that may have alighted too near
his perch and pursues it beyond the bounds of justice all the while
screaming his rasping cry into the intruders ears that must pierce as deep
as the thrusts from his relentless beak He has even been known to drive off
woodpeckers and bluebirds from the hollows in the trees that he like them
chooses for a nest and appropriate the results of their labor for his
scarcely less belligerent mate With a slight but important and indispensable
addition the stolen nest is ready to receive her four creamcolored eggs
that look as if a pen dipped in purple ink had been scratched over them

The fact that gives the greatcrested flycatcher a unique interest among all
North American birds is that it invariably lines its nest with snakeskins if
one can be had Science would scarcely be worth the studying if it did not set
our imaginations to work delving for plausible reasons for Natures strange
doings Most of us will doubtless agree with Wilson who made a special study
of these interesting nests and never found a single one without cast
snakeskins in it even in districts where snakes were so rare they were
supposed not to exist at all that the lining was chosen to terrorize all
intruders The scientific mind that is unwilling to dismiss any detail of
Natures work as merely arbitrary and haphazard is greatly exercised over the
reason for the existence of crests on birds But surely may not the sight of
snakeskins that first greet the eyes of the fledgling flycatchers as they
emerge from the shell be a good and sufficient reason why the feathers on
their little heads should stand on end In the absence of a snakeskin I
have found an onion skin and shad scales in the nest says John Burroughs
who calls this bird the wild Irishman of the flycatchers


OLIVESIDED FLYCATCHER Contotus borealis Flycatcher family

Length  7 to inches About an inch longer than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Dusky olive or grayish brown above head
 darkest Wings and tail blackish brown the former sometimes
 but not always margined and tipped with dusky white Throat
 yellowish white other under parts slightly lighter shade than
 above Olivegray on sides A tuft of yellowishwhite downy
 feathers on flanks Bristles at base of bill
Range  From Labrador to Panama Winters in the tropics Nests
 usually north of United States but it also breeds in the
 Catskills
Migrations  May September Resident only in northern part of
 Its range

Only in the migrations may people south of Massachusetts hope to see this
flycatcher which can be distinguished from the rest of its kin by the darker
under parts and by the fluffy
yellowishwhite tufts of feathers on its flanks Its habits have the family
characteristics it takes its food on the wing suddenly sallying forth from
its perch darting about midair to seize its prey then as suddenly returning
to its identical point of vantage usually in some distended dead limb in the
treetop it is pugnacious bold and tyrannical mopish and inert when not on
the hunt but wonderfully alert and swift when in pursuit of insect or
feathered foe The short necks of the flycatchers make their heads appear
large for their bodies a peculiarity slightly emphasized in this member of
the family High up in some evergreen tree well out on a branch over which
the shapeless mass of twigs and moss that serves as a nest is saddled four or
five buffspeckled eggs are laid and by some special dispensation rarely fall
out of their insecure cradle

A sharp loud whistle wheuowheuowheuo rings out from the throat of
this olivesided tyrant warning all intruders off the premises but however
harshly he may treat the rest of the feathered world he has only gentle
devotion to offer his brooding mate


LEAST FLYCATCHER Empidonax minimus Flycatcher family

Called also CHEBEC

Length  5 to 55 inches About an inch smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Gray or olivegray above paler on wings and lower part
 of back and a more distinct olivegreen on head Underneath
 grayish white sometimes faintly suffused with pale yellow
 wings have whitish bars White eyering Lower half of bill
 horn color
Female is slightly more yellowish underneath
Range  Eastern North America from tropics northward to Quebec
Migrations  May September Common summer resident

This the smallest member of its family takes the place of the more southerly
Acadian flycatcher throughout New England and the region of the Great Lakes
But unlike his Southern relative he prefers orchards and gardens close to
our homes for his hunting grounds rather than the wet recesses of the forests
Chebec chebec the diminutive olivepated gray sprite calls out from the
orchard between his aerial sallies after the passing insects that have been
attracted by the decaying fruit and chebec is the name by which many New
Englanders know him

While giving this characteristic callnote with drooping jerking tail
trembling wings and uplifted particolored bill he looks unnerved and limp
by the effort it has cost him But in the next instant a gnat flies past How
quickly the bird recovers itself and charges fulltilt at his passing dinner
The sharp click of his little bill proves that he has not missed his aim and
after careering about in the air another minute or two looking for more game
to snap up on the wing he will return to the same perch and take up his
familiar refrain Without hearing this callnote one might often mistake the
bird for either the wood pewee or the phoebe for all the three are similarly
clothed and have many traits in common The slightly large size of the phoebe
and pewee is not always apparent when they are seen perching on the trees
Unlike the tuft of hay to which the Acadian flycatchers nest has been
likened the least flycatchers home is a neat substantial cupshaped cradle
softly lined with down or horsehair and placed generally in an upright crotch
of a tree well above the ground


THE CHICKADEE Parus atricapillus Titmouse family

Called also BLACKCAPPED TITMOUSE BLACKCAP TIT BLACKCAPPED
 CHICKADEE AOU 1998

 sparrow
Male and Female  Not crested Crown and nape and throat black
 Above gray slightly tinged with brown A white space
 beginning at base of bill extends backwards widening over
 cheeks and upper part of breast forming a sort of collar that
 almost surrounds neck Underneath dirty white with pale rusty
 brown wash on sides Wings and tail gray with white edgings
 Plumage downy
Range  Eastern North America North of the Carolinas to
 Labrador Does not migrate in the North
Migrations  Late September May Winter resident permanent
 resident in northern parts of the United States

No fair weather friend is the jolly little chickadee In the depth of the
autumn equinoctial storm it returns to the tops of the trees close by the
house where through the sunshine snow and tempest of the entire winter
you may hear its cheery irrepressible chickadeedeedeedee or daydayday as
it swings Around the dangling cones of the evergreens It fairly overflows
with good spirits and is never more contagiously gay than in a snowstorm So
active so friendly and cheering what would the long northern winters be like
without this lovable little neighbor

It serves a more utilitarian purpose however than bracing fainthearted
spirits There is no bird that compares with it in destroying the female
cankerworm moths and their eggs writes a wellknown entomologist He
calculates that as a chickadee destroys about 5500 eggs in one day it will
eat 138750 eggs in the twentyfive days it takes the cankerworm moth to
crawl up the trees The moral that it pays to attract chickadees about your
home by feeding them in winter is obvious Mrs Mabel Osgood Wright in her
delightful and helpful book Birdcraft tells us how she makes a sort of a
birdhash of finely minced raw meat waste canaryseed buckwheat and cracked
oats which she scatters in a sheltered spot for all the winter birds The way
this is consumed leaves no doubt of its popularity A raw bone hung from an
evergreen limb is equally appreciated

Friendly as the chickadee is and Dr Abbott declares it the tamest bird we
have it prefers welltimbered districts especially where there are redbud
trees when it is time to nest It is very often clever enough to leave the
labor of hollowing out a nest in the treetrunk to the woodpecker or nuthatch
whose old homes it readily appropriates or when these birds object a
knothole or a hollow fencerail answers every purpose Here in the summer
woods when family cares beset it a plaintive minor whistle replaces the
chickadeedeedee that Thoreau likens to silver tinkling as he heard it on a
frosty morning

 Piped a tiny voice near by
 Gay and polite a cheerful cry
 Chickchickadeedee saucy note
 Out of sound heart and merry throat
 As if it said Goodday good Sir
 Fine afternoon old passenger
 Happy to meet you in these places
 Where January brings few faces
  Emerson


TUFTED TITMOUSE Parus bicolor Titmouse family

Called also CRESTED TITMOUSE CRESTED TOMTIT

Length  6 to 6 inches About the size of the English sparrow
Male and Female  Crest high and pointed Leaden or ashgray
 above darkest on wings and tail Frontlet bill and shoulders
 black space between eyes gray Sides of head dull white Under
 parts light gray sides yellowish tinged with red
Range  United States east of plains and only rarely seen so
 far north as New England
Migrations  October April Winter resident but also found
 throughout the year in many States

A noisy titmouse is Jack Frosts trumpeter may be one of those few
weatherwise proverbs with a grain of truth in them As the chickadee comes
from the woods with the frost so it may be noticed his cousin the crested
titmouse is in more noisy evidence throughout the winter

One might sometimes think his whistle like a tugboats worked by steam But
how effectually nesting cares alone can silence it in April

Titmice always see to it you are not lonely as you walk through the woods
This lordly tomtit with his jaunty crest keeps up a persistent whistle at
you as he flits from tree to tree leading you deeper into the forest calling
out Hereherehere and looking like a pert and jaunty little blue jay
minus his gay clothes Mr Nehrling translates one of the calls
Heedledeedledeedledee and another Petopetopetodayteedaytee But it
is at the former sharply whistled as the crested titmouse gives it that
every dog pricks up his ears

Comparatively little has been written about this bird because it is not often
found in New England where most of the bird litterateurs have lived South of
New York State however it is a common resident and much respected for the
good work it does in destroying injurious insects though it is more fond of
varying its diet with nuts berries and seeds than that allround benefactor
the chickadee


CANADA JAY Perisoreus canadensis Crow and Jay family

Called also WHISKY JACK OR JOHN MOOSEBIRD MEAT BIRD VENISON
 HERON GREASEBIRD CANADIAN CARRIONBIRD CAMP ROBBER GRAY

 robin
Male and Female  Upper p arts gray darkest on wings and tail

Range  Northern parts of the United States and British
 Provinces of North America

The Canada jay looks like an exaggerated chickadee and both birds are equally
fond of bitter cold weather but here the similarity stops short Where the
chickadee is friendly the jay is impudent and bold hardly less of a villain
than his blue relative when it comes to marauding other birds nests and
destroying their young With all his vices however intemperance cannot be
attributed to him in spite of the name given him by the Adirondack lumbermen
and guides Whisky John is a purely innocent corruption of
Wiskatjon as the Indians call this bird that haunts their camps and
familiarly enters their wigwams The numerous popular names by which the
Canada jays are known are admirably accounted for by Mr Hardy in a bulletin
issued by the Smithsonian Institution

They will enter the tents and often alight on the bow of a canoe where the
paddle at every stroke comes within eighteen inches of them I know nothing
which can be eaten that they will not take and I had one steal all my
candles pulling them out endwise one by one from a piece of birch bark in
which they were rolled and another peck a large hole in a keg of castile
soap A duck which I had picked and laid down for a few minutes had the
entire breast eaten out by one or more of these birds I have seen one alight
in the middle of my canoe and peck away at the carcass of a beaver I had
skinned They often spoil deer saddles by pecking into them near the kidneys
They do great damage to the trappers by stealing the bait from traps set for
martens and minks and by eating trapped game They will sit quietly and see
you build a log trap and bait it and then almost before your back is turned
you hear their hateful cacaca as they glide down and peer into it They
will work steadily carrying off meat and hiding it I have thrown out pieces
and watched one to see how much he would carry off He flew across a wide
stream and in a short time looked as bloody as a butcher from carrying large
pieces but his patience held out longer than mine I think one would work as
long as Mark Twains California jay did trying to fill a miners cabin with
acorns through a knothole in the root They are fond of the berries of the
mountain ash and in fact few things come amiss I believe they do not
possess a single good quality except industry

One virtue not mentioned by Mr Hardy is their prudent saving from the summer
surplus to keep the winter storeroom well supplied like a squirrels Such
thrift is the more necessary when a clamorous hungry family of young jays
must be reared while the thermometer is often as low as thirty degrees below
zero at the end of March How eggs are ever hatched at all in a temperature
calculated to freeze any sitting bird stiff is one of the mysteries of the
woods And yet four or five fluffy little jays that look as if they were
dressed in gray fur emerge from the eggs before the spring sunshine has
unbound the icy rivers or melted the snowdrifts piled high around the
evergreens


CATBIRD Galcoscoptes carolinensis  Mockingbird family

Called also BLACKCAPPED THRUSH GRAY CATBIRD AOU 1998

Length  9 inches An inch shorter than the robin
Male and Female  Dark slate above below somewhat paler top of

Migrations  May November Common summer resident

Our familiar catbird of all the feathered tribe presents the most contrary
characteristics and is therefore held in varied estimation  loved admired
ridiculed abused He is the veriest Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde of birds
Exquisitely proportioned with finely poised black head and satingray coat
which he bathes most carefully and prunes and prinks by the hour he appears
from his toilet a Beau Brummell an aristocraticlooking even dandified
neighbor Suddenly as if shot he drops head and tail and assumes the most
hangdog air without the least sign of selfrespect then crouches and
lengthens into a roll head forward and tail straightened till he looks like
a little short gray snake lank and limp Anon with a jerk and a sprint
every muscle tense tail erect eyes snapping he darts into the air intent
upon some wellplanned mischief It is impossible to describe his various
attitudes or moods In song and call he presents the same opposite
characteristics How such a bird exquisite in style can demean himself to
utter such harsh altogether hateful catcalls and squawks as have given the
bird his common name is a wonder when in the next moment his throat swells
and beginning phutphutcoquillicot he gives forth a long glorious song only
second to that of the wood thrush in melody He is a jester a caricaturist a
mockingbird

The catbirds nest is like a veritable scrapbasket loosely woven of coarse
twigs bits of newspaper scraps and rags till this rough exterior is softly
lined and made fit to receive the four to six pretty dark greenblue eggs to
be laid therein

As a fruit thief harsh epithets are showered upon the friendly confiding
little creature at our doors but surely his depredations may be pardoned for
he is industrious at all times and unusually adroit in catching insects
especially in the moth stage


THE MOCKINGBIRD Mimus polyglottus Mockingbird family

Called also NORTHERN MOCKINGBIRD AOU 1998

Length  9 to 10 inches About the size of the robin
Male and Female  Gray above wings and wedgeshaped tail
 brownish upper wing feathers tipped with white outer tail
 quills white conspicuous in flight chin white underneath
 light gray shading to whitish
Range  Peculiar to torrid and temperate zones of two Americas
Migrations  No fixed migrations usually resident where seen

North of Delaware this commonest of Southern birds is all too rarely seen
outside of cages yet even in midwinter it is not unknown in Central Park New
York This is the angel that it is said the catbird was before he fell from
grace Slim neat graceful imitative amusing with a rich tender song that
only the thrush can hope to rival and with an instinctive preference for the
society of man it is little wonder he is a favorite caged or free He is a
most devoted parent too when the four or six speckled green eggs have
produced as many mouths to be supplied with insects and berries

In the Connecticut Valley where many mockingbirds nests have been found
year after year they are all seen near the ground and without exception are
loosely poorly constructed affairs of leaves feathers grass and even rags

With all his virtues it must be added however that this charming bird is a
sad tease There is no sound whether made by bird or beast about him that
he cannot imitate so clearly as to deceive every one but himself Very rarely
can you find a mockingbird without intelligence and mischief enough to
appreciate his ventriloquism In Sidney Laniers college notebook was found
written this reflection A poet is the mockingbird of the spiritual
universe In him are collected all the individual songs of all individual
natures Later in life with the same thought in mind he referred to the
bird as yon slim Shakespeare on the tree His exquisite stanzas To Our
Mockingbird exalt the singer with the immortals

 Trillets of humor  shrewdest whistle  wit 
 Contralto cadences of grave desire
 Such as from off the passionate Indian pyre
 Drift down through sandalodored flames that split
 About the slim young widow who doth sit
 And sing above  midnights of tone entire 
 Tissues of moonlight shot with songs of fire 
 Bright drops of tune from oceans infinite
 Of melody sipped off the thinedged wave
 And trickling down the beak  discourses brave
 Of serious matter that no man may guess 
 Goodfellow greetings cries of light distress 
 All these but now within the house we heard
 O Death wast thou too deaf to hear the bird
     
 Nay Bird my grief gainsays the Lords best right
 The Lord was fain at some late festal time
 That Keats should set all heavens woods in rhyme
 And Thou in birdnotes Lo this tearful night
 Methinks I see thee fresh from Deaths despite
 Perched in a palmgrove wild with pantomime
 Oer blissful companies couched in shady thyme
 Methinks I hear thy silver whistlings bright
 Meet with the mighty discourse of the wise 
 Till broad Beethoven deaf no more and Keats
 Midst of much talk uplift their smiling eyes
 And mark the music of thy woodconceits
 And halfway pause on some large courteous word
 And call thee Brother O thou heavenly Bird


JUNCO Junco hyemalis Finch family

 feathers white conspicuous in flight
Female  Lighter gray inclining to brown
Range  North America Not common in warm latitudes Breeds in

Migrations  September April Winter resident

Leaden skies above snow below is Mr Parkhursts suggestive description of
this rather timid little neighbor that is only starved into familiarity When
the snow has buried seed and berries a flock of juncos mingling sociably
with the sparrows and chickadees about the kitchen door will pick up scraps
of food with an intimacy quite touching in a bird naturally rather shy Here
we can readily distinguish these little grayrobed monks and nuns as Miss
Florence Merriam calls them

They are trim sprightly sleek and even natty their dispositions are genial
and vivacious not quarrelsome like their sparrow cousins and what is
perhaps best about them they are birds we may surely depend upon seeing in
the winter months A few come forth in September migrating at night from the
deep woods of the north where they have nested and moulted during the summer
but not until frost has sharpened the air are large numbers of them seen
Rejoicing in winter they nevertheless do not revel in the deep and fierce
arctic blasts as the snowflakes do but take good care to avoid the open
pastures before the hard storms overtake them

Early in the spring their song is sometimes heard before they leave us to woo
and to nest in the north Mr Bicknell describes it as a crisp callnote a
simple trill and a faint whispered warble usually much broken but not
without sweetness


WHITEBREASTED NUTHATCH Sitta carolinensis Nuthatch family

Called also TREEMOUSE DEVIL DOWNHEAD

Length  55 to 6 inches A trifle smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Upper parts slatecolor Top of head and nape
 black Wings dark slate edged with black that fades to brown
 Tail feathers brownish black with white bars Sides of head
 and underneath white shading to pale reddish under the tail
 Females head leaden Body flat and compact Bill longer than
 head
Range  British provinces to Mexico Eastern United States
Migrations  October April Common resident Most prominent in
 winter

 Shrewd little haunter of woods all gray
 Whom I meet on my walk of a winter day 
 Youre busy inspecting each cranny and hole
 In the ragged bark of yon hickory bole
 You intent on your task and I on the law
 Of your wonderful head and gymnastic claw

 The woodpecker well may despair of this feat 
 Only the fly with you can compete
 So much is clear but I fain would know
 How you can so reckless and fearless go
 Head upward head downward all one to you
 Zenith and nadir the same in your view
  Edith M Thomas

Could a dozen lines well contain a fuller description or more apt
characterization of a bird than these To a Nuthatch

With more artless inquisitiveness than fear this lively little acrobat stops
his hammering or hatcheting at your approach and stretching himself out from
the tree until it would seem he must fall off he peers down at you head
downward straight into your upturned operaglasses If there is too much snow
on the upper side of a branch watch how he runs along underneath it like a
fly busily tapping the bark or adroitly breaking the decayed bits with his
bill as he searches for the spiders eggs larvae etc hidden there yet
somehow between mouthfuls managing to call out his cheery quank quank
hank hank

Titmice and nuthatches which have many similar characteristics are often
seen in the most friendly hunting parties on the same tree A pine woods is
their dearest delight There as the mercury goes down their spirits only
seem to go up higher In the spring they have been thought by many to migrate
in flocks whereas they are only retreating with their relations away from the
haunts of men to the deep cool woods where they nest With infinite patience
the nuthatch excavates a hole in a tree lining it with feathers and moss and
often depositing as many as ten white eggs speckled with red and lilac for a
single brood


REDBREASTED NUTHATCH Sitta canadensis Nuthatch family

Called also CANADA NUTHATCH

Length  4 to 475 inches Onethird smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Leadcolored above brownish on wings and tail Head
 neck and stripe passing through eye to shoulder black
 Frontlet chin and shoulders white also a white stripe over
 eye meeting on brow Under parts light rusty red Tail
 feathers barred with white near end and tipped with pale
 brown
Female  Has crown of brownish black and is lighter beneath
 than male
Range  Northern parts of North America Not often seen south of
 the most northerly States
Migrations  November April Winter resident

The brighter coloring of this tiny hardy bird distinguishes from the other
and larger nuthatch with whom it is usually seen for the winter birds have a
delightfully social manner so that a colony of these Free masons is apt to
contain not only both kinds of nuthatches and chickadees but kinglets and
brown creepers as well It shares the family habit of walking about the trees
head downward and running along the under side of limbs like a fly By
Thanksgiving Day the quank quank of the whitebreasted species is answered
by the taitaitait of the redbreasted cousin in the orchard where the
family party is celebrating with an elaborate menu of slugs insects eggs
and oily seeds from the evergreen trees

For many years this nuthatch a more northern species than the whitebreasted
bird was thought to be only a spring and autumn visitor but latterly it is
credited with habits like its congeners in nearly every particular


LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE Lanius ludovicianus Shrike family

Length  85 to 9 inches A little smaller than the robin
Male and Female  Upper parts gray narrow black line across
 forehead connecting small black patches on sides of head at
 base of bill Wings and tail black plentifully marked with
 white the outer tail feathers often being entirely white and
 conspicuous in flight Underneath white or very light gray
 Bill hooked and hawklike
Range  Eastern United States to the plains
Migrations  May October Summer resident

It is not easy even at a slight distance to distinguish the loggerhead from
the Northern shrike Both have the pernicious habit of killing insects and
smaller birds and impaling them on thorns both have the peculiarity of
flying with strong vigorous flight and much wingflapping close along the
ground then suddenly rising to a tree on the lookout for prey Their harsh
unmusical callnotes are similar too and their hawklike method of dropping
suddenly upon a victim on the ground below is identical Indeed the same
description very nearly answers for both birds But there is one very
important difference While the Northern shrike is a winter visitor the
loggerhead being his Southern counterpart does not arrive until after the
frost is out of the ground and he can be sure of a truly warm welcome A
lesser distiction between the only two representatives of the shrike family
that frequent our neighborhood  and they are two too many  is in the
smaller size of the loggerhead and its lightergray plumage But as both these
birds select some high commanding position like a distended branch near the
treetop a cupola housepeak lightningrod telegraph wire or
weathervane the better to detect a passing dinner it would be quite
impossible at such a distance to know which shrike was sitting up there
silently plotting villainies without remembering the season when each may be
expected


NORTHERN SHRIKE Lanius borealis Shrike family

Called also BUTCHERBIRD NINEKILLER

Length  95 to 105 inches About the size of the robin
Male  Upper parts slategray wing quills and tail black
 edged and tipped with white conspicuous in flight a white
 spot on centre of outer wing feathers A black band runs
 from bill through eye to side of throat Light gray below
 tinged with brownish and faintly marked with waving lines
 of darker gray Bill hooked and hawklike
Female  With eyeband more obscure than males and with
 More distinct brownish cast on her plumage
Range  Northern North America South in winter to middle
 Portion of United States
Migrations  November April A roving winter resident

Matching the bravest of the brave among birds of prey in deeds of daring and
no less relentless than reckless the shrike compels that sort of deference
not unmixed with indignation we are accustomed to accord to creatures of
seeming insignificance whose exploits demand much strength great spirit and
insatiate love for carnage We cannot be indifferent to the marauder who takes
his own wherever he finds it  a feudal baron who holds his own with
undisputed sway  and an ogre whose victims are so many more than he can eat
that he actually keeps a private graveyard for the balance Who is honestly
able to give the shrikes a better character than Dr Coues just quoted A few
offer them questionable defence by recording the large numbers of English
sparrows they kill in a season as if wanton carnage were ever justifiable

Not even a hawk itself can produce the consternation among a flock of sparrows
that the harsh rasping voice of the butcherbird creates for escape they well
know to be difficult before the small ogre swoops down upon his victim and
carries it off to impale it on a thorn or frozen twig there to devour it
later piecemeal Every shrike thus either impales or else hangs up as a
butcher does his meat more little birds of many kinds fieldmice
grasshoppers and other large insects than it can hope to devour in a week of
bloody orgies Fieldmice are perhaps its favorite diet but even snakes are
not disdained

More contemptible than the actual slaughter of its victims if possible is
the method by which the shrike often lures and sneaks upon his prey Hiding in
a clump of bushes in the meadow or garden he imitates with fiendish
cleverness the callnotes of little birds that come in cheerful response
hopping and flitting within easy range of him His bloody work is finished in
a trice Usually however it must be owned the shrikes hunting habits are
the reverse of sneaking Perched on a point of vantage on some treetop or
weathervane his hawklike eye can detect a grasshopper going through the
grass fifty yards away

What is our surprise when some fine warm day in March just before our
butcher ogre sneak and fiend leaves us for colder regions to hear him
break out into song Love has warmed even his cold heart and with sweet
warbled notes on the tip of a beak that but yesterday was reeking with his
victims blood he starts for Canada leaving behind him the only good
impression he has made during a long winters visit


BOHEMIAN WAXWING Ampelis garrulus Waxwing family

Called also BLACKTHROATED WAX WING LAPLAND WAX WING SILKTAIL

Length  8 to 95 inches A little smaller than the robin
Male and Female  General color drab with faint brownish wash
 above shading into lighter gray below Crest conspicuous
 being nearly an inch and a half in length rufous at the base
 shading into light gray above velvetyblack forehead chin
 and line through the eye Wings grayish brown with very dark
 quills which have two white bars the bar at the edge of the
 upper wing coverts being tipped with red sealingwaxlike
 points that give the bird its name A few wing feathers tipped
 with yellow on outer edge Tail quills dark brown with yellow
 band across the end and faint red streaks on upper and inner
 sides
Range  Northern United States and British America Most common
 in Canada and northern Mississippi region
Migrations  Very irregular winter visitor

When Charles Bonaparte Prince of Canino who was the first to count this
common waxwing of Europe and Asia among the birds of North America published
an account of it in his Synopsis it was considered a very rare bird indeed
It may be these waxwings have greatly increased but however uncommon they may
still be considered certainly no one who had ever seen a flock containing
more than a thousand of them resting on the trees of a lawn within sight of
New York City as the writer has done could be expected to consider the birds
very rare

The Bohemian waxwing like the only other member of the family that ever
visits us the cedarbird is a roving gipsy In Germany they say seven years
must elapse between its visitations which the superstitious old cronies are
wont to associate with woful stories of pestilence  just such tales as are
resurrected from the depths of morbid memories here when a comet reappears or
the sevenyear locust ascends from the ground

The goings and comings of these birds are certainly most erratic and
infrequent nevertheless when hunger drives them from the far north to feast
upon the juniper and other winter berries of our Northern States they come in
enormous flocks making up in quantity what they lack in regularity of visits
and evenness of distribution

Surely no bird has less right to be associated with evil than this mild
waxwing It seems the very incarnation of peace and harmony Part of a flock
that has lodged in a tree will sit almost motionless for hours and whisper in
softly hissed twitterings very much as a company of Quaker ladies similarly
dressed might sit at yearly meeting Exquisitely clothed in silkygray
feathers that no berry juice is ever permitted to stain they are dainty
gentle aristocraticlooking birds a trifle heavy and indolent perhaps when
walking on the ground or perching but as they fly in compact squads just
above the treetops their flight is exceedingly swift and graceful


BAYBREASTED WARBLER Dendroica castanea Wood Warbler family

Length  525 to 575 inches A little smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Crown chin throat upper breast and sides dull
 chestnut Forehead sides of head and cheeks black Above
 olivegray streaked with black Underneath buffy Two white
 wingbars Outer tail quills with white patches on tips Cream
 white patch on either side of neck
Female  Has more greenisholive above
Range  Eastern North America from Hudsons Bay to Central
 America Nests north of the United States Winters in tropical
 limit of range
Migrations  May September Rare migrant

The chestnut breast of this capricious little visitor makes him look like a
diminutive robin In spring when these warblers are said to take a more
easterly route than the one they choose in autumn to return by to Central
America they may be so suddenly abundant that the fresh green trees and
shrubbery of the garden will contain a dozen of the busy little hunters
Another season they may pass northward either by another route or leave your
garden unvisited and perhaps the people in the very next town may be counting
your rare bird common while it is simply perverse

Whether common or rare before your acquaintance has had time to ripen into
friendship away go the freaky little creatures to nest in the treetops of
the Canadian coniferous forests


CHESTNUTSIDED WARBLER Dendroica pennsylvanica Wood Warbler
family

Called also BLOODYSIDED WARBLER

Length  About 5 inches More than an inch shorter than the
 English sparrow
Male  Top of head and streaks in wings yellow A black line
 running through the eye and round back of crown and a black
 spot in front of eye extending to cheeks Ear coverts chin
 and underneath white Back greenish gray and slate streaked
 with black Sides of bird chestnut Wings which are streaked
 with black and yellow have yellowishwhite bars Very dark
 tail with white patches on inner vanes of the outer quills
Female  Similar but duller Chestnut sides are often scarcely
 apparent
Range  Eastern North America from Manitoba and Labrador to the
 tropics where it winters
Migrations  May September Summer resident most common in
 migrations

In the Alleghanies and from New Jersey and Illinois northward this restless
little warbler nests in the bushy borders of woodlands and the undergrowth of
the woods for which he forsakes our gardens and orchards after a very short
visit in May While hopping over the ground catching ants of which he seems
to be inordinately fond or flitting actively about the shrubbery after grubs
and insects we may note his coat of many colors
 patchwork in which nearly all the warbler colors are curiously combined
With drooped wings that often conceal the birds chestnut sides which are his
chief distinguishing mark and with tail erected like a redstarts he hunts
incessantly Here in the garden he is as refreshingly indifferent to your
interest in him as later in his breeding haunts he is shy and distrustful His
song is bright and animated like that of the yellow warbler


GOLDENWINGED WARBLER Helminthophila chrysoptera Wood Warbler
family

Length  About 5 inches More than an inch shorter than the
 English sparrow
Male  Yellow crown and yellow patches on the wings Upper parts
 bluish gray sometimes tinged with greenish Stripe through the
 eye and throat black Sides of head chin and line over the eye
 white Underneath white grayish on sides A few white markings
 on outer tail feathers
Female  Crown duller gray where male is black with olive
 Upper parts and grayer underneath
Range  From Canadian border to Central America where it
 winters
Migrations  May September Summer resident

After one has seen a goldenwinged warbler fluttering hither and thither about
the shrubbery of a park within sight and sound of a great citys distractions
and with blissful unconcern of them all partaking of a hearty lunch of
insects that infest the leaves before ones eyes one counts the bird less
rare and shy than one has been taught to consider it Whoever looks for a
warbler with gaudy yellow wings will not find the goldenwinged variety His
wings have golden patches only and while these are distinguishing marks they
are scarcely prominent enough features to have given the bird the rather
misleading name he bears But then most warblers names are misleading They
serve their best purpose in cultivating patience and other gentle virtues in
the novice

Such habits and choice of haunts as characterize the bluewinged warbler are
also the goldenwingeds But their voices are quite different the formers
being sharp and metallic while the latters zee zee zee comes more lazily
and without accent


MYRTLE WARBLER Dendroica coronata Wood Warbler family

Called also YELLOWRUMPED WARBLER AOU 1998 MYRTLE BIRD
 YELLOWCROWNED WARBLER

Length  5 to 55 inches About an inch smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  In summer plumage A yellow patch on top of head lower
 back and either side of the breast Upper parts bluish slate
 streaked with black Upper breast black throat white all
 other under parts whitish streaked with black Two white wing
 bars and tail quills have white spots near the tip In winter
 Upper parts olivebrown streaked with black the yellow spot
 on lower back the only yellow mark remaining Wingbars
 grayish
Female  Resembles male in winter plumage
Range  Eastern North America Occasional on Pacific slope
 Summers from Minnesota and northern New England northward to
 Fur Countries Winters from Middle States south ward into
 Central America a few often remaining at the northern United
 States all the winter
Migrations  April October November Also but more rarely a
 winter resident

The first of the warblers to arrive in the spring and the last to leave us in
the autumn some even remaining throughout the northern winter the myrtle
warbler next to the summer yellowbird is the most familiar of its
multitudinous kin Though we become acquainted with it chiefly in the
migrations it impresses us by its numbers rather than by any gorgeousness of
attire The four yellow spots on crown lower back and sides are its
distinguishing marks and in the autumn these marks have dwindled to only one
that on the lower back or rump The great difficulty experienced in
identifying any warbler is in its restless habit of flitting about

For a few days in early May we are forcibly reminded of the Florida peninsula
which fairly teems with these birds they become almost superabundant a
distraction during the precious days when the rarer species are quietly
slipping by not to return again for a year perhaps longer for some warblers
are notoriously irregular in their routes north and south and never return by
the way they travelled in the spring

But if we look sharply into every group of myrtle warblers we are quite
likely to discover some of their dainty fragile cousins that gladly seek the
escort of birds so fearless as they By the last of May all the warblers are
gone from the neighborhood except the constant little summer yellowbird and
redstart

In autumn when the myrtle warblers return after a busy enough summer passed
in Canadian nurseries they chiefly haunt those regions where juniper and
bayberries abound These latter Myrica cerifera or the myrtle waxberries
as they are sometimes called and which are the birds favorite food have
given it their name Wherever the supply of these berries is sufficient to
last through the winter there it may be found foraging in the scrubby bushes
Sometimes driven by cold and hunger from the fields this hardiest member of a
family that properly belongs to the tropics seeks shelter and food close to
the outbuildings on the farm


PARULA WARBLER Compsothlypis americana Wood Warbler family

Called also BLUE YELLOWBACKED WARBLER NORTHERN PARULA AOU
 1998
Length  45 to 475 inches About an inch and a half shorter
 than the English sparrow
Male and Female  Slatecolored above with a greenishyellow or
 bronze patch in the middle of the back Chin throat and
 breast yellow A black bluish or rufous band across the
 breast usually lacking in female Underneath white sometimes
 marked with rufous on sides but these markings are variable
 Wings have two white patches outer tail feathers have white
 patch near the end
Range  Eastern North America Winters from Florida southward
Migrations  April October Summer resident

Through an open window of an apartment in the very heart of New York City a
parula warbler flew this spring of 1897 surely the daintiest most
exquisitely beautiful bird visitor that ever voluntarily lodged between two
brick walls

A number of such airy tiny beauties flitting about among the blossoms of the
shrubbery on a bright May morning and swaying on the slenderest branches with
their inimitable grace is a sight that the memory should retain into old age
They seem the very embodiment of life joy beauty grace of everything
lovely that birds by any possibility could be Apparently they are wafted
about the garden they fly with no more effort than a dainty lifting of the
wings as if to catch the breeze that seems to lift them as it might a bunch
of thistledown They go through a great variety of charming posturings as they
hunt for their food upon the blossoms and tender fresh twigs now creeping
like a nuthatch along the bark and peering into the crevices now gracefully
swaying and balancing like a goldfinch upon a slender pendent stem One
little sprite pauses in its hunt for the insects to raise its pretty head and
trill a short and wiry song

But the parula warbler does not remain long about the gardens and orchards
though it will not forsake us altogether for the Canadian forests where most
of its relatives pass the summer It retreats only to the woods near the
water if may be or to just as close a counterpart of a swampy southern
woods where the Spanish or Usnea moss drapes itself over the cypresses as
it can find here at the north Its rarely found beautiful nest that hangs
suspended from a slender branch very much like the Baltimore orioles is so
woven and festooned with this moss that its concealment is perfect


BLACKTHROATED BLUE WARBLER Dendroica caerulescens Wood Warbler
family

Length  530 inches About an inch shorter than the English
 sparrow
Male  Slatecolor not blue above lightest on forehead and
 darkest on lower back Wings and tail edged with bluish
 Cheeks chin throat upper breast and sides black Breast and
 underneath white White spots on wings and a little white on
 tail
Female  Olivegreen above underneath soiled yellow Wingspots
 inconspicuous Tail generally has a faint bluish tinge
Range  Eastern North America from Labrador to tropics where
 It winters
Migrations  May September Usually a migrant only in the
 United States

Whoever looks for this beautifully marked warbler among the bluebirds will
wish that the man who named him had possessed a truer eye for color But if
the name so illy fits the bright slatecolored male how grieved must be his
little
oliveandyellow mate to answer to the name of blackthroated blue warbler
when she has neither a black throat nor a blue feather It is not easy to
distinguish her as she flits about the twigs and leaves of the garden in May
or early autumn except as she is seen in company with her husband whose name
she has taken with him for better or for worse The white spot on the wings
should always be looked for to positively identify this bird

Before flying up to a twig to peck off the insects the birds have a pretty
vireo trick of cocking their heads on one side to investigate the quantity
hidden underneath the leaves They seem less nervous and more deliberate than
many of their restless family

Most warblers go over the Canada border to nest but there are many records of
the nests of this species in the Alleghanies as far south as Georgia in the
Catskills in Connecticut northern Minnesota and Michigan Laurel thickets
and moist undergrowth of woods in the United States and more commonly pine
woods in Canada are the favorite nesting haunts A sharp zip zip like some
midsummer insects noise is the birds callnote but its lovesong zee
zee zee or twee twea tweaee as one authority writes it is only rarely
heard in the migrations It is a languid drawling little strain with an
upward slide that is easily drowned in the full bird chorus of May

BLUE AND BLUISH BIRDS


THE BLUEBIRD Sialia sialis Thrush family

Called also BLUE ROBIN EASTERN BLUEBIRD AOU 1998

Length  7 inches About an inch longer than the English
 sparrow
Male  Upper parts wings and tail bright blue with rusty wash
 in autumn Throat breast and sides cinnamonred Underneath
 white
Female  Has duller blue feathers washed with gray and a paler
 breast than male
Range  North America from Nova Scotia and Manitoba to Gulf of
 Mexico Southward in winter from Middle States to Bermuda and
 West Indies
Migrations  March November Summer resident A few sometimes
 remain throughout the winter

With the first soft plaintive warble of the bluebirds early in March the
sugar camps waiting for their signal take on a bustling activity the farmer
looks to his plough orders are hurried off to the seedsmen a fever to be out
of doors seizes one spring is here Snowstorms may yet whiten fields and
gardens high winds may howl about the trees and chimneys but the little blue
heralds persistently proclaim from the orchard and garden that the spring
procession has begun to moveTrually trually they sweetly assert to our
incredulous ears

The bluebird is not always a migrant except in the more northern portions of
the country Some representatives there are always with us but the great
majority winter south and drop out of the spring procession on its way
northward the males a little ahead of their mates which show housewifely
instincts immediately after their arrival A pair of these rather
undemonstrative
matteroffact lovers go about looking for some deserted woodpeckers hole in
the orchard peering into cavities in the fencerails or into the birdhouses
that once set up in the
oldfashioned gardens for their special benefit are now appropriated too
often by the ubiquitous sparrow Wrens they can readily dispossess of an
attractive tenement and do With a temper as heavenly as the color of their
feathers the bluebirds sense of justice is not always so adorable But
sparrows unnerve them into cowardice The comparatively infrequent nesting of
the bluebirds about our homes at the present time is one of the most
deplorable results of unrestricted sparrow immigration Formerly they were the
commonest of bird neighbors

Nestbuilding is not a favorite occupation with the bluebirds that are
conspicuously domestic none the less Two and even three broods in a season
fully occupy their time As in most cases the motherbird does more than her
share of the work The male looks with wondering admiration at the housewifely
activity applauds her with song feeds her as she sits brooding over the
nestful of pale greenishblue eggs but his adoration of her virtues does not
lead him into emulation

 Shifting his light load of song
 From post to post along the cheerless fence

Lowell observed that he carried his duties quite as lightly

When the young birds first emerge from the shell they are almost black they
come into their splendid heritage of color by degrees lest their young heads
might be turned It is only as they spread their tiny wings for their first
flight from the nest that we can see a few blue feathers

With the first cool days of autumn the bluebirds collect in flocks often
associating with orioles and kingbirds in sheltered sunny places where
insects are still plentiful Their steady undulating flight now becomes
erratic as they take food on the wing  a habit that they may have learned by
association with the kingbirds for they have also adopted the habit of
perching upon some conspicuous lookout and then suddenly launching out into
the air for a passing fly and returning to their perch Long after their
associates have gone southward they linger like the last leaves on the tree
It is indeed goodbye to summer when the bluebirds withdraw their touch of
brightness from the dreary November landscape

The bluebirds from Canada and the northern portions of New England and New
York migrate into Virginia and the Carolinas the birds from the Middle States
move down into the Gulf States to pass the winter It was there that countless
numbers were cut off by the severe winter of 189495 which was so severe in
that section


INDIGO BUNTING Passerina cyanea Finch family

Called also INDIGO BIRD

Female  Plain siennabrown above Yellowish on breast and
 shading to white underneath and indistinctly streaked Wings

 Mexico
Migrations  May September Summer resident

The glowing indigo of this tropicallooking visitor that so delighted
Thoreau in the Walden woods often seems only the more intense by comparison
with the blue sky against which it stands out in relief as the bird perches
singing in a treetop What has this gaily dressed dapper little cavalier in
common with his dingy sparrow cousins that haunt the ground and delight in
dustbaths leaving their feathers no whit more dingy than they were before
and in temper as in plumage suggesting more of earth than of heaven
Apparently he has nothing and yet the small brown bird in the roadside
thicket which you have misnamed a sparrow not noticing the glint of blue in
her shoulders and tail is his mate Besides the structural resemblances
which are of course the only ones considered by ornithologists in
classifying birds the indigo buntings have several sparrowlike traits They
feed upon the ground mainly upon seeds of grasses and herbs with a few
insects interspersed to give relish to the grain they build grassy nests in
low bushes or tall rank grass and their flight is short and labored Borders
of woods roadside thickets and even garden shrubbery with open pasture lots
for foraging grounds near by are favorite haunts of these birds that return
again and again to some preferred spot But however close to our homes they
build theirs our presence never ceases to be regarded by them with anything
but suspicion not to say alarm Their metallic cheep cheep warns you to
keep away from the little bluewhite eggs hidden away securely in the bushes
and the nervous tail twitchings and jerkings are pathetic to see Happily for
the safety of their nest the brooding mother has no telltale feathers to
attract the eye Dense foliage no more conceals the male birds brilliant coat
than it can the tanagers or orioles

With no attempt at concealment which he doubtless understands would be quite
impossible he chooses some high conspicuous perch to which he mounts by easy
stages singing as he goes and there begins a loud and rapid strain that
promises much but growing weaker and weaker ends as if the bird were either
out of breath or too weak to finish Then suddenly he begins the same song
over again and keeps up this continuous performance for nearly half an hour
The noonday heat of an August day that silences nearly every other voice
seems to give to the indigo birds only fresh animation and timbre


THE BELTED KINGFISHER Ceryle alcyon Kingfisher family

Called also THE HALCYON

Length  12 to 13 inches About onefourth as large again as the
 robin
Male  Upper part grayish blue with prominent crest on head
 reaching to the nape A white spot in front of the eye Bill
 longer than the head which is large and heavy Wings and the
 short tail minutely speckled and marked with broken bands of
 white Chin band around throat and underneath white Two
 bluish bands across the breast and a bluish wash on sides
Female  Female and immature specimens have rufous bands where
 The adult males are blue Plumage of both birds oily
Range  North America except where the Texan kingfisher
 replaces it in a limited area in the Southwest Common from
 Labrador to Florida east and west Winters chiefly from
 Virginia southward to South America
Migrations  March December Common summer resident Usually a
 winter resident also

If the kingfisher is not so neighborly as we could wish or as he used to be
it is not because he has grown less friendly but because the streams near our
homes are fished out Fish he must and will have and to get them nowadays it
is too often necessary to follow the stream back through secluded woods to the
quiet waters of its source a clear cool pond or lake whose scaly inmates
have not yet learned wisdom at the point of the sportsmans fly

In such quiet haunts the kingfisher is easily the most conspicuous object in
sight where he perches on some dead or projecting branch over the water
intently watching for a dinner that is all unsuspectingly swimming below
Suddenly the bird drops  dives there is a splash a struggle and then the
lone fisherman returns triumphant to his perch holding a shining fish in
his beak If the fish is small it is swallowed at once but if it is large and
bony it must first be killed against the branch A few sharp knocks and the
struggles of the fish are over but the kingfishers have only begun How he
gags and writhes swallows his dinner and then regretting his haste brings
it up again to try another wider avenue down his throat I The many abortive
efforts he makes to land his dinner safely below in his stomach his grim
contortions as the fishbones scratch his throatlining on their way down and
up again force a smile in spite of the birds evident distress It is small
wonder he supplements his fish diet with various kinds of the larger insects
shrimps and freshwater mollusks

Flying well over the treetops or along the waterways the kingfisher makes
the woodland echo with his noisy rattle that breaks the stillness like a
watchmans at midnight It is perhaps the most familiar sound heard along
the banks of the inland rivers No love or cradle song does he know Instead
of softening and growing sweet as the voices of most birds do in the nesting
season the endearments uttered by a pair of mated kingfishers are the most
strident rattly shrieks ever heard by lovers it sounds as if they were
perpetually quarrelling yet they are really particularly devoted

The nest of these birds like the bank swallows is excavated in the face of
a high bank preferably one that rises from a stream and at about six feet
from the entrance of the tunnel six or eight clear shining white eggs are
placed on a curious nest All the fish bones and scales that being
indigestible are disgorged in pellets by the parents are carefully carried
to the end of the tunnel to form a prickly cradle for the unhappy fledglings
Very rarely a nest is made in the hollow trunk of a tree but wherever the
home is the kingfishers become strongly attached to it returning again and
again to the spot that has cost them so much labor to excavate Some observers
have accused them of appropriating the holes of the waterrats

In ancient times of myths and fables kingfishers or halcyons were said to
build a floating nest on the sea and to possess some mysterious power that
calmed the troubled waves while the eggs were hatching and the young birds
were being reared hence the term halcyon days meaning days of fair
weather


BLUE JAY Cyanocitta cristata Crow and Jay family

Length  11 to 12 inches A little larger than the robin

Male and Female  Blue above Black band around the neck
 joining some black feathers on the back Under parts dusky
 white Wing coverts and tail bright blue striped transversely
 with black Tail much rounded Many feathers edged and tipped
 with white Head finely crested bill tongue and legs black
Range  Eastern coast of North America to the plains and from
 northern Canada to Florida and eastern Texas
Migrations  Permanent resident Although seen in flocks moving
 southward or northward they are merely seeking happier hunting
 grounds not migrating

No bird of finer color or presence sojourns with us the year round than the
blue jay In a peculiar sense his is a case o beauty covering a multitude of
sins Among close students of bird traits we find none so poor as to do him
reverence Dishonest cruel inquisitive murderous voracious villainous
are some of the epithets applied to this bird of exquisite plumage Emerson
however has said in his defence he does more good than harm alluding no
doubt to his habit of burying nuts and hard seeds in the ground so that many
a waste place is clothed with trees and shrubs thanks to his propensity and
industry

He is mischievous as a small boy destructive as a monkey deft at hiding as a
squirrel He is unsociable and unamiable disliking the society of other
birds His harsh screams shrieks and most aggressive and unmusical calls
seem often intended maliciously to drown the songs of the sweetvoiced
singers

From April to September the breeding and moulting season the blue jays are
almost silent only sallying forth from the woods to pillage and devour the
young and eggs of their more peaceful neighbors In a bulky nest usually
placed in a treecrotch high above our heads from four to six eggs
olivegray with brown spots are laid and most carefully tended

Notwithstanding the unlovely characteristics of the blue jay we could ill
spare the flash of color like a bit of blue sky dropped from above which is
so rare a tint even in our land that we number not more than three or four
true blue birds and in England it is said there is none


BLUE GROSBEAK Guiraca carulea Finch family

Length  7 inches About an inch larger than the English
 sparrow
Male  Deep blue dark and almost black on the back wings and
 tail black slightly edged with blue and the former marked
 with bright chestnut Cheeks and chin black Bill heavy and
 bluish
Female  Grayish brown above sometimes with bluish tinge on
 head lower back and shoulders Wings dark olivebrown with
 faint buff markings tail same shade as wings but witb bluish
 gray markings Underneath brownish creamcolor the breast
 feathers often blue at the base
Range  United States from southern New England westward to the
 Rocky Mountains and southward into Mexico and beyon dM ost
 common in the Southwest Rare along the Atlantic seaboard
Migrations  May September Summer resident

This beautiful but rather shy and solitary bird occasionally wanders eastward
to rival the bluebird and the indigo bunting in their rare and lovely
coloring and eclipse them both in song Audubon we remember found the nest
in New Jersey Pennsylvania is still favored with one now and then but it is
in the Southwest only that the blue grosbeak is as common as the evening
grosbeak is in the Northwest Since rice is its favorite food it naturally
abounds where that cereal grows Seeds and kernels of the hardest kinds that
its heavy strong beak is well adapted to crack constitute its diet when it
strays beyond the ricefields

Possibly the heavy bills of all the grosbeaks make them look stupid whether
they are or not  a characteristic that the blue grosbeaks habit of sitting
motionless with a vacant stare many minutes at a time unfortunately
emphasizes

When seen in the roadside thickets or tall weeds such as the field sparrow
chooses to frequent it shows little fear of man unless actually approached
and threatened but whether this fearlessness comes from actual confidence or
stupidity is by no means certain Whatever the motive of its inactivity it
accomplishes an end to be desired by the cleverest bird its presence is
almost never suspected by the passerby and its grassy nest on a treebranch
containing three or four pale bluishwhite eggs is never betrayed by look or
sign to the marauding small boy


BARN SWALLOW Chelidon erythrogaster Swallow family

Length  65 to 7 inches A trifle larger than the English
 sparrow Apparently considerably larger because of its wide
 wingspread
Male  Glistening steelblue shading to black above Chin
 breast and underneath bright chestnutbrown and brilliant buff
 that glistens in the sunlight A partial collar of steelblue
 Tail very deeply forked and slender
Female  Smaller and paler with shorter outer tail feathers
 making the fork less prominent
Range  Throughout North America Winters in tropics of both
 Americas
Migrations  April September Summer resident

Any one who attempts to describe the coloring of a birds plumage knows how
inadequate words are to convey a just idea of the delicacy richness and
brilliancy of the living tints But happily the beautiful barn swallow is
too familiar to need description Wheeling about our barns and houses
skimming over the fields its bright sides flashing in the sunlight playing
cross tag with its friends at evening when the insects too are on the
wing gyrating darting and gliding through the air it is no more possible
to adequately describe the exquisite grace of a swallows flight than the
glistening buff of its breast

This is a typical bird of the air as an oriole is of the trees and a sparrow
of the ground Though the swallow may often be seen perching on a telegraph
wire suddenly it darts off as if it had received a shock of electricity and
we see the bird in its true element

While this swallow is peculiarly American it is often confounded with its
European cousin Hirundo rustica in noted ornithologies

Up in the rafters of the barn or in the arch of an old bridge that spans a
stream these swallows build their bracketlike nests of clay or mud pellets
intermixed with straw Here the noisy little broods pick their way out of the
white eggs curiously spotted with brown and lilac that were all too familiar
in the marauding days of our childhood


CLIFF SWALLOW Petrochelidon lunifrons Swallow family

Called also EAVE SWALLOW CRESCENT SWALLOW ROCKY MOUNTAIN
 SWALLOW

Length  6 inches A trifle smaller than the English sparrow
 Apparently considerably larger because of its wide wingspread
Male and Female  Steelblue above shading to blueblack on
 crown of head and on wings and tail A brownishgray ring
 around the neck Beneath dusty white with rufous tint
 Crescentlike frontlet Chin throat sides of head and tail
 coverts rufous
Range  North and South America Winters in the tropics
Migrations  Early April Late September Summer resident

Not quite so brilliantly colored as the barn swallow nor with tail so deeply
forked and consequently without so much grace in flying and with a squeak
rather than the really musical twitter of the gayer bird the cliff swallow
may be positively identified by the rufous feathers of its tail coverts but
more definitely by its crescentshaped frontlet shining like a new moon hence
its specific Latin name from luna  moon and frons  front

Such great numbers of these swallows have been seen in the far West that the
name of Rocky Mountain swallows is sometimes given to them though however
rare they may have been in 1824 when DeWitt Clinton thought he discovered
them near Lake Champlain they are now common enough in all parts of the
United States

In the West this swallow is wholly a cliffdweller but it has learned to
modify its home in different localities As usually seen it is gourdshaped
opened at the top built entirely of mud pellets bricks without straw
softly lined with feathers and wisps of grass and attached by the larger part
to a projecting cliff or eave

Like all the swallows this bird lives in colonies and the claycolored nests
beneath the eaves of barns are often so close together that a group of them
resembles nothing so much as a gigantic wasps nest It is said that when
swallows pair they are mated for life but then more is said about swallows
than the most tireless birdlover could substantiate The tradition that
swallows fly low when it is going to rain may be easily credited because the
air before a storm is usually too heavy with moisture for the winged insects
upon which the swallows feed to fly high


MOURNING DOVE Zenaidura macroura Pigeon family

Called also CAROLINA DOVE TURTLE DOVE

Length  12 to 13 inches About onehalf as large again as the
 robin
Male  Grayish brown or fawncolor above varying to bluish
 gray Crown and upper part of head greenish blue with green
 and golden metallic reflections on sides of neck A black spot
 under each ear Forehead and breast reddish buff lighter
 underneath General impression of color bluish fawn Bill

 Arizona Most common in temperate climate east of Rocky
 Mountains
Migrations  March November Common summer resident not
 Migratory south of Virginia

The beautiful softcolored plumage of this incessant and rather melancholy
lovemaker is not on public exhibition To see it we must trace the acooo
cooo coooo cooo to its source in the thick foliage in some tree in an
outoftheway corner of the farm or to an evergreen near the edge of the
woods The slow plaintive notes more like a dirge than a lovesong
penetrate to a surprising distance They may not always be the same lovers we
hear from April to the end of summer but surely the sound seems to indicate
that they are The dove is a shy bird attached to its gentle and refined mate
with a devotion that has passed into a proverb but caring little or nothing
for the society of other feathered friends and very little for its own kind
unless after the nesting season has passed In this respect it differs widely
from its cousins the wild pigeons flocks of which numbering many millions
are recorded by Wilson and other early writers before the days when netting
these birds became so fatally profitable

What the dove finds to adore so ardently in the shiftless housewife as Mrs
Wright calls his ladylove must pass the comprehension of the phoebe that
constructs such an exquisite home or of a bustling energetic Jenny wren
that looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of
idleness She is a flabby spineless bundle of flesh and pretty feathers
gentle and refined in manners but slack and incompetent in all she does Her
nest consists of few loose sticks without rim or lining and when her two
babies emerge from the white eggs that somehow do not fall through or roll
out of the rickety lattice their tender little naked bodies must suffer from
many bruises We are almost inclined to blame the inconsiderate mother for
allowing her offspring to enter the world unclothed  obviously not her
fault though she is capable of just such negligence Fortunate are the baby
doves when their lazy mother scatters her makeshift nest on top of one that a
robin has deserted as she frequently does It is almost excusable to take her
young birds and rear them in captivity where they invariably thrive mate
and live happily unless death comes to one when the other often refuses food
and grieves its life away

In the wild state when the nesting season approaches both birds make curious
acrobatic flights above the treetops then after a short sail in midair
they return to their perch This appears to be their only giddiness and
frivolity unless a dustbath in the country road might be considered a
dissipation

In the autumn a few pairs of doves show slight gregarious tendencies feeding
amiably together in the grain fields and retiring to the same roost at
sundown


BLUEGRAY GNATCATCHER Polioptila coerulea Gnatcatcher family

Called also SYLVAN FLYCATCHER

Length  45 inches About two inches smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Grayish blue above dull grayish white below Grayish
 tips on wings Tail with white outer quills changing gradually
 through black and white to all black on centre quills Narrow
 black band over the forehead and eyes Resembles in manner and
 form a miniature catbird
Female  More grayish and less blue and without the black on
 head
Range  United States to Canadian border on the north the
 Rockies on the west and the Atlantic States from Maine to
 Florida most common in the Middle States A rare bird north of
 New Jersey Winters in Mexico and beyond
Migrations  May September Summer resident

In thick woodlands where a stream that lazily creeps through the mossy oozy
ground attracts myriads of insects to its humid neighborhood this tiny hunter
loves to hide in the denser foliage of the upper branches He has the habit of
nervously flitting about from twig to twig of his relatives the kinglets but
unhappily he lacks their social friendly instincts and therefore is rarely
seen Formerly classed among the warblers then among the flycatchers while
still as much a lover of flies gnats and mosquitoes as ever his vocal
powers have now won for him recognition among the singing birds Some one has
likened his voice to the squeak of a mouse and Nuttall says it is scarcely
louder which is all too true for at a little distance it is quite
inaudible But in addition to the mouselike callnote the tiny bird has a
rather feeble but exquisitely finished song so faint it seems almost as it
the bird were singing in its sleep

If by accident you enter the neighborhood of its nest you soon find out that
this timid softvoiced little creature can be roused to rashness and make its
presence disagreeable to ears and eyes alike as it angrily darts about your
unoffending head pecking at your face and uttering its shrill squeak close to
your very eardrums All this excitement is in defence of a dainty
lichencovered nest whose presence you may not have even suspected before
and of four or five bluishwhite speckled eggs well beyond reach in the
treetops

During the migrations the bird seems not unwilling to show its delicate trim
little body that has often been likened to a diminutive mockingbirds very
near the homes of men Its graceful postures its song and constant motion
are sure to attract attention In Central Park New York City the bird is not
unknown

BROWN OLIVE OR GRAYISH BROWN AND BROWN AND GRAY SPARROWY BIRDS


HOUSE WREN Troglodytes aedon Wren family

Length  45 to 5 inches Actually about onefourth smaller than
 the English sparrow apparently only half as large because of
 its erect tail
Male and Female  Upper parts cinnamonbrown Deepest shade on
 head and neck lightest above tail which is more rufous Back
 has obscure dusky bars wings and tail are finely barred
 Underneath whitish with grayishbrown wash and faint bands
 Most prominent on sides
Range  North America from Manitoba to the Gulf Most common in
 the United States from the Mississippi eastward Winters south
 of the Carolinas
Migrations  April October Common summer resident

Early some morning in April there will go off under your window that most
delightful of all alarmclocks  the tiny friendly house wren just returned
from a long visit south Like some little mountain spring that having been
imprisoned by winter ice now bubbles up in the spring sunshine and goes
rippling along over the pebbles tumbling over itself in merry cascades so
this little wrens song bubbles ripples cascades in a miniature torrent of
ecstasy

Year after year these birds return to the same nesting places a box set up
against the house a crevice in the barn a niche under the eaves but once
home always home to them The nest is kept scrupulously clean the
housecleaning like the housebuilding and renovating being accompanied by
the cheeriest of songs that makes the bird fairly tremble by its intensity
But however angelic the voice of the house wren its temper can put to flight
even the English sparrow Need description go further

Six to eight minutely speckled fleshcolored eggs suffice to keep the
nervous irritable parents in a state bordering on frenzy whenever another
bird comes near their habitation With tail erect and head alert the father
mounts on guard singing a perfect ecstasy of love to his silent little mate
that sits upon the nest if no danger threatens but both rush with passionate
malice upon the first intruder for it must be admitted that Jenny wren is a
sad shrew

While the little family is being reared or indeed at any time no one is
wise enough to estimate the millions of tiny insects from the garden that find
their way into the tireless bills of these wrens

It is often said that the house wren remains at the north all the year which
though not a fact is easily accounted for by the coming of the winter wrens
just as the others migrate in the autumn and by their return to Canada when
Jenny wren makes up her featherbed under the eaves in the spring


CAROLINA WREN Thryothorus ludovicianus Wren family

Called also MOCKING WREN

Length  6 inches Just a trifle smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Chestnutbrown above A whitish streak
 beginning at base of bill passes through the eye to the nape
 of the neck Throat whitish Under parts light buffbrown Wings
 and tail finely barred with dark
Range  United States from Gulf to northern Illinois and
 Southern New England
Migrations  A common resident except at northern boundary of
 range where it is a summer visitor

This largest of the wrens appears to be the embodiment of the entire family
characteristics it is exceedingly active nervous and easily excited
quicktempered full of curiosity peeping into every hole and corner it
passes short of flight as it is of wing inseparable from its mate till
parted by death and a gushing lyrical songster that only death itself can
silence It also has the wrenlike preference for a nest that is roofed over
but not too near the homes of men

Undergrowths near water brush heaps rocky bits of woodland are favorite
resorts The Carolina wren decidedly objects to being stared at and likes to
dart out of sight in the midst of the underbrush in a twinkling while the
operaglasses are being focussed To let off some of his superfluous
vivacity Nature has provided him with two safetyvalves one is his voice
another is his tail With the latter he gesticulates in a manner so expressive
that it seems to be a certain index to what is passing in his busy little
brain  drooping it after the habit of the catbird when he becomes limp
with the emotion of his lovesong or holding it erect as alert and
inquisitive he peers at the impudent intruder in the thicket below his perch

But it is his joyous melodious bubbling song that is his chief fascination
He has so great a variety of strains that many people have thought that he
learned them from other birds and so have called him what many ornithologists
declare that he is not  a mocking wren And he is one of the few birds that
sing at night  not in his sleep or only by moonlight but even in the total
darkness just before dawn he gives us the same wideawake song that
entrances us by day


WINTER WREN Troglodytes biemalis Wren family

Length  4 to 45 inches About onethird smaller than the
 English sparrow Apparently only half the size
Male and Female  Cinnamonbrown above with numerous short
 dusky bars Head and neck without markings Underneath rusty
 dimly and finely barred with dark brown Tail short
Range  United States east and west and from North Carolina to
 the Fur Countries
Migrations  October April Summer resident Commonly a winter
 resident in the South and Middle States only

It all too rarely happens that we see this tiny mouselike wren in summer
unless we come upon him suddenly and overtake him unawares as he creeps shyly
over the mossy logs or runs literally like a flash under the fern and
through the tangled underbrush of the deep cool woods His presence there is
far more likely to be detected by the ear than the eye

Throughout the nesting season music fairly pours from his tiny throat it
bubbles up like champagne it gushes forth in a lyrical torrent and overflows
into every nook of the forest that seems entirely pervaded by his song While
music is everywhere it apparently comes from no particular point and search
as you may the tiny singer still eludes exasperates and yet entrances

If by accident you discover him balancing on a swaying twig never far from
the ground with his comical little tail erect or more likely pointing
towards his head what a pert saucy minstrel he is You are lost in amazement
that so much music could come from a throat so tiny

Comparatively few of his admirers however hear the exquisite notes of this
little brown woodsprite for after the nesting season is over he finds little
to call them forth during the bleak snowy winter months when in the Middle
and Southern States he may properly be called a neighbor Sharp hunger rather
than natural boldness drives him near the homes of men where he appears just
as the house wren departs for the South With a forced confidence in man that
is almost pathetic in a bird that loves the forest as he does he picks up
whatever lies about the house or barn in the shape of foodcrumbs from the
kitchen door a morsel from the dogs plate a little seed in the barnyard
happily rewarded if he can find a spider lurking in some sheltered place to
give a flavor to the unrelished grain Now he becomes almost tame but we feel
it is only because he must be

The spot that decided preference leads him to either winter or summer is
beside a bubbling spring In the moss that grows near it the nest is placed in
early summer nearly always roofed over and entered from the side in true
wrenfashion and as the young fledglings emerge from the creamywhite eggs
almost the first lesson they receive from their devoted little parents is in
the fine art of bathing Even in winter weather when the wren has to stand on
a rim of ice he will duck and splash his diminutive body It is recorded of a
certain little individual that he was wont to dive through the icy water on a
December day Evidently the wrens as a family are not far removed in the
evolutionary scale from true waterbirds


LONGBILLED MARSH WREN Cistothorus palustris Wren family

Called also MARSH WREN AOU 1998

Length  45 to 52 inches Actually a little smaller than the
 English sparrow Apparently half the size
Male and Female  Brown above with white line over the eye and
 the back irregularly and faintly streaked with white Wings and
 tail barred with darker cinnamonbrown Underneath white Sides
 dusky Tail long and often carried erect Bill extra long and
 slender
Range  United States and southern British America
Migrations  May September Summer resident

Sometimes when you are gathering cattails in the river marshes an alert
nervous little brown bird rises startled from the rushes and tries to elude
you as with short jerky flight it goes deeper and deeper into the marsh
where even the rubber boot may not follow It closely resembles two other
birds found in such a place the swamp sparrow and the shortbilled marsh
wren but you may know by its long slender bill that it is not the latter
and by the absence of a bright bay crown that it is not the shyest of the
sparrows

These marsh wrens appear to be especially partial to running water their
homes are not very far from brooks and rivers preferably those that are
affected in their rise and flow by the tides They build in colonies and
might be called inveterate singers for no single bird is often permitted to
finish his bubbling song without half the colony joining in a chorus

Still another characteristic of this particularly interesting bird is its
unique architectural effects produced with coarse grasses woven into globular
form and suspended in the reeds Sometimes adapting its nest to the building
material at hand it weaves it of grasses and twigs and suspends it from the
limb of a bush or tree overhanging the water where it swings like an
orioles The entrance to the nest is invariably on the side

More devoted homebodies than these little wrens are not among the feathered
tribe Once let the hand of man desecrate their nest even before the tiny
speckled eggs are deposited in it and off go the birds to a more inaccessible
place where they can enjoy their home unmolested Thus three or four nests
may be made in a summer


SHORTBILLED MARSH WREN Cistothorus stellaris Wren family

Called also SEDGE WREN AOU 1998

Length  4 to 5 inches Actually about onethird smaller than
 the English sparrow but apparently only half its size
Male and Female  Brown above faintly streaked with white
 black and buff Wings and tail barred with same Underneath
 white with buff and rusty tinges on throat and breast Short
 bill
Range  North America from Manitoba southward in winter to Gulf
 of Mexico Most common in north temperate latitudes
Migrations  Early May Late September

Where redwinged blackbirds like to congregate in oozy pastures or near boggy
woods the little shortbilled wren may more often be heard than seen for he
is more shy if possible than his longbilled cousin and will dive down into
the sedges at your approach very much as a duck disappears under water But
if you see him at all it is usually while swaying to and fro as he clings to
some tall stalk of grass keeping his balance by the nervous jerky tail
motions characteristic of all the wrens and singing with all his might
Oftentimes his tail reaches backward almost to his head in a most exaggerated
wrenfashion

Samuels explains the peculiar habit both the longbilled and the shortbilled
marsh wrens have of building several nests in one season by the theory that
they are made to protect the sitting female for it is noticed that the male
bird always lures a visitor to an empty nest and if this does not satisfy his
curiosity to another one to prove conclusively that he has no family in
prospect

Wild rice is an ideal nesting place for a colony of these little marsh wrens
The home is made of sedge grasses softly lined with the softer meadow grass
or plantdown and placed in a tussock of tall grass or even upon the ground
The entrance is on the side But while fond of moist places both for a home
and feeding ground it will be noticed that these wrens have no special
fondness for running water so dear to their longbilled relatives Another
distinction is that the eggs of this species instead of being so densely
speckled as to look brown are pure white


BROWN THRASHER Harporhynchus rufus Thrasher and Mockingbird
 family

Called also BROWN THRUSH GROUND THRUSH RED THRUSH BROWN

 Theres a merry brown thrush sitting up in a tree
 He is singing to me He is singing to me
 And what does he say little girl little boy
 Oh the worlds running over with joy

The hackneyed poem beginning with this stanza that delighted our nursery days
has left in our minds a fairly correct impression of the bird He still proves
to be one of the perennially joyous singers like a true cousin of the wrens
and when we study him afield he appears to give his whole attention to his
song with a selfconsciousness that is rather amusing than the reverse What
musician wouldnt be conscious of his own powers he seems to challenge us
if he possessed such a gift Seated on a conspicuous perch as if inviting
attention to his performance with uplifted head and drooping tail he repeats
the one exultant dashing air to which his repertoire is limited without
waiting for an encore Much practice has given the notes a brilliancy of
execution to be compared only with the mockingbirds but in spite of the name
ferruginous mockingbird that Audubon gave him he does not seem to have the
faculty of imitating other birds songs Thoreau says the Massachusetts
farmers when planting their seed always think they hear the thrasher say
Drop it drop it  cover it up cover it up  pull it up pull it up pull
it up

One of the shatterings of childish impressions that age too often brings is
when we learn by the books that our merry brown thrush is no thrush at all
but a thrasher  first cousin to the wrens in spite of his speckled breast
large size and certain thrushlike instincts such as never singing near the
nest and shunning mankind in the nesting season to mention only two
Certainly his bold swinging flight and habit of hopping and running over the
ground would seem to indicate that he is not very far removed from the true
thrushes But he has one undeniable wrenlike trait that of twitching
wagging and thrashing his long tail about to help express his emotions It
swings like a pendulum as he rests on a branch and thrashes about in a most
ludicrous way as he is feeding on the ground upon the worms insects and
fruit that constitute his diet

Before the fatal multiplication of cats and in unfrequented sandy locations
still the thrasher builds her nest upon the ground thus earning the name
ground thrush that is often given her but with dearly paidfor wisdom she
now most frequently selecting a low shrub or tree to cradle the two broods
that all too early in the summer effectually silence the fathers delightful
song

To many of us the veery as they call the Wilsons thrush in New England is
merely a voice a sylvan mystery reflecting the sweetness and wildness of the
forest a vocal willothewisp that after enticing us deeper and deeper
into the woods where we sink into the spongy moss of its damp retreats and
become entangled in the wild grapevines twined about the saplings and
underbrush still sings to us from unapproachable tangles Plainly if we want
to see the bird we must let it seek us out on the fallen log where we have
sunk exhausted in the chase

Presently a brown bird scuds through the fern It is a thrush you guess in a
minute from its slender graceful body At first you notice no speckles on
its breast but as it comes nearer obscure arrowheads are visible  not
heavy heartshaped spots such as plentifully speckle the larger wood thrush
or the smaller hermit It is the smallest of the three commoner thrushes and
it lacks the ring about the eye that both the others have Shy and elusive it
slips away again in a most unfriendly fashion and is lost in the wet tangle
before you have become acquainted You determine however before you leave
the log to cultivate the acquaintance of this bird the next spring when
before it mates and retreats to the forest it comes boldly into the gardens
and scratches about in the dry leaves on the ground for the lurking insects
beneath Miss Florence Merriam tells of having drawn a number of veeries about
her by imitating their callnote which is a whistled wheew whoit very easy
to counterfeit when once heard Taweelah taweelah twilah twilah
Professor Ridgeway interprets their song that descends in a succession of
trills without break or pause but no words can possibly convey an idea of the
quality of the music The veery that never claims an audience sings at night
also and its weird sweet strains floating through the woods at dusk thrill
one like the mysterious voice of a disembodied spirit

Whittier mentions the veery in The Playmate

 And here in spring the veeries sing
 The song of long ago


WOOD THRUSH Turdus mustelinus Thrush family

Called also SONG THRUSH WOOD ROBIN BELLBIRD

Male and Female  Brown above reddish on head and shoulders
 shading into olivebrown on tail Throat breast and
 underneath white plain in the middle but heavily marked on
 sides and breast with heartshaped spots of very dark brown
 Whitish eyering
Migrations  Late April or early May October Summer resident

When Nuttall wrote of this solitary and retiring songster before the
country was as thickly settled as it is today it possibly had not developed
the confidence in men that now distinguishes the wood thrush from its shy
congeners that are distinctly wood birds which it can no longer strictly be
said to be In city parks and country places where plenty of trees shade the
village streets and lawns it comes near you half hopping half running with
dignified unconsciousness and even familiarity all the more delightful in a
bird whose family instincts should take it into secluded woodlands with their
shady dells Perhaps in its heart of hearts it still prefers such retreats
Many conservative wood thrushes keep to their wild haunts and it must be
owned not a few liberals that discard family traditions at other times seek
the forest at nesting time But social as the wood thrush is and abundant
too it is also eminently highbred and when contrasted with its tawny
cousin the veery that skulks away to hide in the nearest bushes as you
approach or with the hermit thrush that pours out its heavenly song in the
solitude of the forest how gracious and full of gentle confidence it seems
Every gesture is graceful and elegant even a wriggling beetle is eaten as
daintily as caviare at the kings table It is only when its confidence in you
is abused and you pass too near the nest that might easily be mistaken for a
robins just above your head in a sapling that the wood thrush so far
forgets itself as to become excited Pit pit pit sharply reiterated is
called out at you with a strident quality in the tone that is painful evidence
of the fearful anxiety your presence gives this gentle bird

Too many guardians of nests whether out of excessive happiness or excessive
stupidity have a dangerous habit of singing very near them Not so the wood
thrush Come to me as the opening notes of its flutelike song have been
freely translated invites the intruder far away from where the blue eggs lie
cradled in ambush is as good a rendering into syllables of the luscious song
as could very well be made Pure liquid rich and luscious it rings out
from the trees on the summer air and penetrates our home like
Uoliaeolinolinolaeoleelee strait of music from a stringed quartette


HERMIT THRUSH Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii Thrush family

Called also SWAMP ANGEL LITTLE THRUSH

Length  725 to 75 inches About onefourth smaller than the
 robin
Male and Female  Upper parts olivebrown reddening near the
 tail which is pale rufous quite distinct from the color of
 the back Throat sides of neck and breast pale buff Feathers
 of throat and neck finished with dark arrowpoints at tip
 feathers of the breast have larger rounded spots Sides
 brownish gray Underneath white A yellow ring around the eye
 Smallest of the thrushes
Range  Eastern parts of North America Most common in the
 United States to the plains Winters from southern Illinois and
 New Jersey to Gulf
Migrations  April November Summer resident

The first thrush to come and the last to go nevertheless the hermit is little
seen throughout its long visit north It may loiter awhile in the shrubby
roadsides in the garden or the parks in the spring before it begins the
serious business of life in a nest of moss coarse grass and pineneedles
placed on the ground in the depths of the forest but by the middle of May its
presence in the neighborhood of our homes becomes only a memory Although one
never hears it at its best during the migrations how one loves to recall the
serene ethereal evening hymn The finest sound in Nature John Burroughs
calls it It is not a proud gorgeous strain like the tanagers or the
grosbeaks he says it suggests no passion or emotion  nothing personal
but seems to be the voice of that calm sweet solemnity one attains to in his
best moments It realizes a peace and a deep solemn joy that only the finest
souls may know

Beyond the question of even the hypercritical the hermit thrush has a more
exquisitely beautiful voice than any other American bird and only the
nightingales of Europe can be compared with it It is the one theme that
exhausts all the ornithologists musical adjectives in a vain attempt to
convey in words any idea of it to one who has never heard it for the quality
of the song is as elusive as the bird itself But why should the poets be so
silent Why has it not called forth such verse as the English poets have
lavished upon the nightingale Undoubtedly because it lifts up its heavenly
voice in the solitude of the forest whereas the nightingales singing in loud
choruses in the moonlight under the poets very window cannot but impress his
waking thoughts and even his dreams with their melody

Since the severe storm and cold in the Gulf States a few winters ago where
vast numbers of hermit thrushes died from cold and starvation this bird has
been very rare in haunts where it used to be abundant The other thrushes
escaped because they spend the winter farther south


ALICES THRUSH Turdus alicia Thrush family

Called also GRAYCHEEKED THRUSH now separated into two
 species the more midwestern GRAYCHEEKED THRUSH and the New
 England and Adirondack BICKNELLS THRUSH AOU 1998

Length  75 to 8 inches About the size of the bluebird
Male and Female  Upper parts uniform olivebrown Eyering
 whitish Cheeks gray sides dull grayish white Sides of the
 throat and breast pale creambuff speckled with arrowshaped
 points on throat and with halfround darkbrown marks below
Range  North America from Labrador and Alaska to Central
 America
Migrations  Late April or May October Chiefly seen in
 migrations except at northern parts of its range

One looks for a prettier bird than this least attractive of all the thrushes
in one that bears such a suggestive name Like the olivebacked thrush from
which it is almost impossible to tell it when both are alive and hopping about
the shrubbery its plumage above is a dull olivebrown that is more protective
than pleasing

Just as Wilson hopelessly confused the olivebacked thrush with the hermit so
has Alices thrush been confounded by later writers with the olivebacked
from which it differs chiefly in being a trifle larger in having gray cheeks
instead of buff and in possessing a few faint streaks on the throat Where it
goes to make a home for its greenishblue speckled eggs in some low bush at
the northern end of its range it bursts into song but except in the nesting
grounds its voice is never heard Mr Bradford Torrey who heard it singing in
the White Mountains describes the song as like the thrushs in quality but
differently accented Weeoweeotittiweeo

In New England and New York this thrush is most often seen during its autumn
migrations As it starts up and perches upon a low branch before you it
appears to have longer legs and a broader squarer tail than its congeners


OLIVEBACKED THRUSH Turdus ustulatus swainsonii Thrush family

Called also SWAINSONS THRUSH AOU 1998

Length  7 to 750 inches About onefourth smaller than the
 robin
Male and Female  Upper parts olivebrown Whole throat and
 breast yellowbuff shading to ashy on sides and to white
 underneath Buff ring around eye Dark streaks on sides of
 throat none on centre and larger more spotlike marks on
 breast
Range  North America to Rockies a few stragglers on Pacific
 slope Northward to arctic countries
Migrations  April October Summer resident in Canada Chiefly
 a migrant in United States

Mr Parkhurst tells of finding this the commonest bird in the Park Central
Park New York not even excepting the robin during the last week of May on
a certain year but usually it must be owned we have to be on the lookout to
find it or it will pass unnoticed in the great companies of more conspicuous
birds travelling at the same time Whitethroated sparrows often keep it
company on the long journeys northward and they may frequently be seen
together hopping sociably about the garden the thrush calling out a rather
harsh note  puk puk  quite different from the liquid mellow calls of
the other thrushes to resent either the sparrows bad manners or the
inquisitiveness of a human disturber of its peace But this gregarious habit
and neighborly visit end even before acquaintance fairly begins and the
thrushes are off for their nesting grounds in the pine woods of New England or
Labrador if they are travelling up the east coast or to Alaska British
Columbia or Manitoba if west of the Mississippi There they stay all summer
often travelling southward with the sparrows in the autumn as in the spring

Why they should prefer coniferous trees unless to utilize the needles for a
nest is not understood Low trees and bushes are favorite building sites with
them as with others of the family though these thrushes disdain a mud lining
to their nests Those who have heard the olivebacked thrush singing an
evensong to its brooding mate compare it with the veerys but it has a break
in it and is less simple and pleasing than the latters


LOUISIANA WATER THRUSH Seiurus motacilla Wood Warbler family

Length  6 to 628 inches Just a trifle smaller than the
 English sparrow
Male and Female  Grayish olivebrown upper parts with
 conspicuous white line over the eye and reaching almost to the
 nape Underneath white tinged with pale buff Throat and line
 through the middle plain Other parts streaked with very dark
 brown rather faintly on the breast giving them the speckled
 breast of the thrushes Heavy dark bill
Range  United States westward to the plains northward to
 southern New England Winters in the tropics
Migrations  Late April October Summer resident

This bird that so delighted Audubon with its hightrilled song as he tramped
with indefatigable zeal through the hammocks of the Gulf States seems to be
almost the counterpart of the Northern water thrush just as the loggerhead is
the Southern counterpart of the Northern shrike Very many Eastern birds have
their duplicates in Western species as we all know and it is most
interesting to trace the slight external variations that different climates
and diet have produced on the same bird and thus differentiated the species
In winter the Northern water thrush visits the cradle of its kind the swamps
of Louisiana and Florida and no doubt by daily contact with its congeners
there keeps close to their cherished traditions from which it never deviates
farther than Nature compels though it penetrate to the arctic regions during
its summer journeys

With a more southerly range the Louisiana water thrush does not venture
beyond the White Mountains and to the shores of the Great Lakes in summer but
even at the North the same woods often contain both birds and there is
opportunity to note just how much they differ The Southern bird is slightly
the larger possibly an inch it is more gray and it lacks a few of the
streaks notably on the throat that plentifully speckle its Northern
counterpart but the habits of both of these birds appear to be identical
Only for a few days in the spring or autumn migrations do they pass near
enough to our homes for us to study them and then we must ever be on the
alert to steal a glance at them through the operaglasses for birds more shy
than they do not visit the garden shrubbery at any season Only let them
suspect they are being stared at and they are under cover in a twinkling

Where mountain streams dash through tracts of mossy spongy ground that is
carpeted with fern and moss and overgrown with impenetrable thickets of
underbrush and tangles of creepers  such a place is the favorite resort of
both the water thrushes With a rubber boot missing clothes torn and temper
by no means unruffled you finally stand over the Louisiana thrushs nest in
the roots of an upturned tree immediately over the water or else in a mossy
rootbelaced bank above a purling stream A liquidtrilled warble wild and
sweet breaks the stillness and like Audubon you feel amply rewarded for
your pains though you may not be prepared to agree with him in thinking the
song the equal of the European nightingales


NORTHERN WATER THRUSH Seiurus noveboracensis Wood Warbler
family

Called also NEW YORK WATER THRUSH AQUATIC WOOD WAGTAIL AQUATIC
 THRUSH

Length  5 to 6 inches A trifle smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Uniform olive or grayish brown above Pale
 buff line over the eye Underneath white tinged with sulphur
 yellow and streaked like a thrush with very dark brown arrow
 headed or oblong spots that are also seen underneath wings
Range  United States westward to Rockies and northward through
 British provinces Winters from Gulf States southward
Migrations  Late April October Summer resident

According to the books we have before us a warbler but who to look at his
speckled throat and breast would ever take him for anything but a diminutive
thrush or studying him from some distance through the operaglasses as he
runs in and out of the little waves along the brook or river shore would not
name him a baby sandpiper The rather unsteady motion of his legs balancing
of the tail and sudden jerking of the head suggest an aquatic bird rather
than a bird of the woods But to really know either man or beast you must
follow him to his home and if you have pluck enough to brave the swamp and
the almost impenetrable tangle of undergrowth where the water thrush chooses
to nest there In the swamp in secluded recesses a shy and hidden bird is
warbling a song and this warbled song that Walt Whitman so adored gives you
your first clue to the proper classification of the bird It has nothing in
common with the serene hymnlike voices of the true thrushes the bird has no
flutelike notes but an emphatic smacking or chucking kind of warble For a
few days only is this song heard about the gardens and roadsides of our
country places Like the Louisiana water thrush this bird never ventures near
the homes of men after the spring and autumn migrations but on the contrary
goes as far away from them as possible preferably to some mountain region
beside a cool and dashing brook where a party of adventurous young climbers
from a summer hotel or the lonely trout fisherman may startle it from its
mossy nest on the ground


FLICKER Colaptes auratus Woodpecker family

Called also GOLDENWINGED WOODPECKER CLAPE PIGEON WOODPECKER
 YELLOWHAMMER HIGH HOLE OR HIGHHOLDER YARUP WAKEUP
 YELLOWSHAFTED WOODPECKER

Length  12 to 13 inches About onefourth as large again as the
 robin
Male and Female  Head and neck bluish gray with a red crescent
 across back of neck and a black crescent on breast Male has
 black cheekpatches that are wanting in female Golden brown
 shading into brownishgray and barred with black above
 Underneath whitish tinged with light chocolate and thickly
 spotted with black Wing linings shafts of wing and tail
 quills bright yellow Above tail white conspicuous when the
 bird flies
Range  United States east of Rockies Alaska and British
 America south of Hudson Bay Occasional on Pacific slope
Migrations  Most commonly seen from April to October Usually
 Resident

If we were to follow the list of thirtysix aliases by which this largest and
commonest of our woodpeckers is known throughout its wide range we should
find all its peculiarities of color flight noises and habits indicated in
its popular names It cannot but attract attention wherever seen with its
beautiful plumage conspicuously yellow if its outstretched wings are looked
at from below conspicuously brown and white if seen upon the ground At a
distance it suggests the meadowlark Both birds wear black crescent breast
decorations and the flicker also has the habit of feeding upon the ground
especially in autumn a characteristic not shared by its relations

Early in the spring this bird of many names and many voices makes itself known
by a long strong sonorous call a sort of proclamation that differs from its
song proper which Audubon calls a prolonged jovial laugh described by
Mrs Wright as Wick wick wick wick and differs also from its rapidly
repeated mellow and most musical cub cub cub cub cub uttered during the
nesting season

Its nasal keeyer vigorously called out in the autumn is less
characteristic however than the sound it makes while associating with its
fellows on the feeding ground  a sound that Mr Frank M Chapman says can be
closely imitated by the swishing of a willow wand

A very ardent and ridiculouslooking lover is this bird as with tail stiffly
spread he sidles up to his desired mate and bows and bobs before her then
retreats and advances bowing and bobbing again very often with a rival lover
beside him whom he generously tolerates trying to outdo him in grace and
general attractiveness Not the least of the birds qualities that must
commend themselves to the bride is his unfailing good nature genial alike in
the home and in the field

The highholders have the peculiar and silly habit of boring out a number of
superfluous holes for nests high up in the trees in buildings or hollow
wooden columns only one of which they intend to use Six white eggs is the
proper number for a household but Dr Coues says the female that has been
robbed keeps on laying three or even four sets of eggs without interruption


MEADOWLARK Sturnella magna Blackbird family

Called also FIELD LARK OLDFIELD LARK EASTERN MEADOWLARK AOU
 1998

Length  10 to 11 inches A trifle larger than the robin
Male  Upper parts brown varied with chestnut deep brown and
 black Crown streaked with brown and black and with a
 creamcolored streak through the centre Darkbrown line
 apparently running through the eye another line over eye
 yellow Throat and chin yellow a large conspicuous black
 crescent on breast Underneath yellow shading into buffy
 brown spotted or streaked with very dark brown Outer tail
 feathers chiefly white conspicuous in flight Long strong
 legs and claws adapted for walking Less black in winter
 plumage which is more grayish brown
Female  Paler than male
Range  North America from Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico
 and westward to the plains where the Western meadowlark takes
 its place Winters from Massachusetts and Illinois southward
Migrations  April Late October Usually a resident a few
 remaining through the winter

In the same meadows with the redwinged blackbirds birds of another feather
but of the same family nevertheless may be found flocking together hunting
for worms and larvae building their nests and rearing their young very near
each other with the truly social instinct of all their kin

The meadowlarks which are really not larks at all but the blackbirds and
orioles cousins are so protected by the coloring of the feathers on their
backs like that of the grass and stubble they live among that ten blackbirds
are noticed for every meadowlark although the latter is very common Not until
you flush a flock of them as you walk along the roadside or through the
meadows and you note the white tail feathers and the black crescents on the
yellow breasts of the large brown birds that rise towards the treetops with
whirring sound and a flight suggesting the quails do you suspect there are
any birds among the tall grasses

Their clear and piercing whistle Spring o the year Spring o the year
rings out from the trees with varying intonation and accent but always sweet
and inspiriting To the birds high vantage ground you may not follow for no
longer having the protection of the high grass it has become wary and flies
away as you approach calling out peentpeent and nervously flitting its tail
again showing the white feather when it rests a moment on the pasture
fencerail

It is like looking for a needle in a haystack to try to find a meadowlarks
nest an unpretentious structure of dried grasses partly arched over and
hidden in a clump of high timothy flat upon the ground But what havoc snakes
and fieldmice play with the whitespeckled eggs and helpless fledglings The
care of rearing two or three broods in a season and the change of plumage to
duller winter tints seem to exhaust the high spirits of the sweet whistler
For a time he is silent but partly regains his vocal powers in the autumn
when with large flocks of his own kind he resorts to marshy feeding grounds
In the winter he chooses for companions the horned larks that walk along the
shore or the snow buntings and sparrows of the inland pastures and will even
include the denizens of the barnyard when hunger drives him close to the
haunts of men

The Western Meadowlark or Prairie Lark Sturnella magna neglecta which many
ornithologists consider a different species from the foregoing as does AOU
1998 is distinguished chiefly by its lighter more grayishbrown plumage by
its yellow cheeks and more especially by its richer fuller song In his
Birds of Manitoba Mr Ernest E Thompson says of this meadowlark In
richness of voice and modulation it equals or excels both wood thrush and
nightingale and in the beauty of its articulation it has no superior in the
whole world of feathered choristers with which I am acquainted


HORNED LARK Otocoris alpestris Lark family

Called also SHORE LARK

Length  75 to 8 inches About onefifth smaller than the
 robin
Male  Upper parts dull brown streaked with lighter on edges
 and tinged with pink or vinaceous darkest on back of head
 neck shoulders and nearest the tail A few erectile feathers
 on either side of the head form slight tufts or horns that are
 wanting in female A black mark from the base of the bill
 passes below the eye and ends in a hornshaped curve on cheeks
 which are yellow Throat clear yellow Breast has crescent
 shaped black patch Underneath soiled white with dusky spots
 on lower breast Tail black the outer feathers margined with
 white noticed in flight
Female  Has yellow eyestripe less prominent markings
 especially on head and is a trifle smaller
Range  Northeastern parts of North America and in winter from
 Ohio and eastern United States as far south as North Carolina
Migrations  October and November March Winter resident

Far away to the north in Greenland and Labrador this true lark the most
beautiful of its genus makes its summer home There it is a conspicuously
handsome bird with its pinkishgray and chocolate feathers that have greatly
faded into dull browns when we see them in the late autumn In the far north
only does it sing and according to Audubon the charming song is flung to
the breeze while the bird soars like a skylark In the United States we hear
only its callnote

Great flocks come down the Atlantic coast in October and November and
separate into smaller bands that take up their residence in sandy stretches
and open tracts near the sea or wherever the food supply looks promising and
there the larks stay until all the seeds buds of bushes berries larvae and
insects in their chosen territory are exhausted They are ever conspicuously
ground birds walkers and when disturbed at their dinner prefer to squat on
the earth rather than expose themselves by flight Sometimes they run nimbly
over the frozen ground to escape an intruder but flying they reserve as a
last resort When the visitor has passed they quickly return to their dinner
If they were content to eat less ravenously and remain slender fewer victims
might be slaughtered annually to tickle the palates of the epicure It is a
mystery what they find to fatten upon when snow covers the frozen ground Even
in the severe midwinter storms they will not seek the protection of the woods
but always prefer sandy dunes with their scrubby undergrowth or open meadow
lands Occasionally a small flock wanders toward the farms to pick up seeds
that are blown from the hayricks or scattered about the barnyard by overfed
domestic fowls

The Prairie Horned Lark Otocoris alpestris praticola is similar to the
preceding but a trifle smaller and paler with a white instead of a yellow
streak above the eye the throat yellowish or entirely white instead of
sulphuryellow and other minor differences It has a far more southerly
range confined to northern portions of the United States from the Mississippi
eastward Once a distinctly prairie bird it now roams wherever large
stretches of open country that suit its purposes are cleared in the East and
remains resident This species also sings in midair on the wing but its song
is a crude halfinarticulate affair barely audible from a height of two
hundred feet


AMERICAN PIPIT Anthus pensilvanicus Wagtail family

Called also TITLARK BROWN OR RED LARK

Length  638 to 7 inches About the size of a sparrow
Male and Female  Upper parts brown wings and tail dark
 olivebrown the wing coverts tipped with buff or whitish and
 ends of outer tail feathers white conspicuous in flight White
 or yellowish eyering and line above the eye Underneath light
 buff brown with spots on breast and sides the under parts
 being washed with brown of various shades Feet brown Hind
 toenail as long as or longer than the toe
Range  North America at large Winters south of Virginia to
 Mexico and beyond
Migrations  April October or November Common in the United
 States chiefly during the migrations

The color of this bird varies slightly with age and sex the under parts
ranging from white through pale rosy brown to a reddish tinge but at any
season and under all circumstances the pipit is a distinctly brown bird
resembling the water thrushes not in plumage only but in the comical tail
waggings and jerkings that alone are sufficient to identify it However the
books may tell us the bird is a wagtail it certainly possesses two strong
characteristics of true larks it is a walker delighting in walking or
running never hopping over the ground and it has the angelic habit of
singing as it flies

During the migrations the pipits are abundant in salt marshes or open
stretches of country inland that with larklike preference they choose for
feeding grounds When flushed all the flock rise together with uncertain
flight hovering and wheeling about the place calling down deedee deedee
above your head until you have passed on your way then promptly returning to
the spot from whence they were disturbed Along the roadsides and pastures
where two or three birds are frequently seen together they are too often
mistaken for the vesper sparrows because of their similar size and coloring
but their easy graceful walk should distinguish them at once from the hopping
sparrow They often run to get ahead of some one in the lane but rarely fly
if they can help it and then scarcely higher than a fencerail Early in
summer they are off for the mountains in the north Labrador is their chosen
nesting ground and they are said to place their grassy nest lined with
lichens or moss flat upon the ground  still another lark trait Their eggs
are chocolatebrown scratched with black


WHIPPOORWILL Antrostomus vociferus Goatsucker family

Called also WHIPPOORWILL AOU 1998

Length  9 to 10 inches About the size of the robin Apparently
 much larger because of its long wings and wide wingspread
Male  A longwinged bird mottled all over with reddish brown
 grayish black and dusky white numerous bristles fringing the
 large mouth A narrow white band across the upper breast Tail
 quills on the end and under side white
Female  Similar to male except that the tail is dusky in color
 where that of the male is white Band on breast buff instead of
 white
Range  United States to the plains Not common near the sea
Migrations  Late April to middle of September Summer resident

The whippoorwill because of its nocturnal habits and plaintive note is
invested with a reputation for occult power which inspires a chilling awe
among superstitious people and leads them insanely to attribute to it an evil
influence but it is a harmless useful night prowler flying low and catching
enormous numbers of hurtful insects always the winged varieties in its
peculiar flytrap mouth

It loves the rocky solitary woods where it sleeps all day but it is seldom
seen even after painstaking search because of its dull mottled markings
conforming so nearly to rocks and dry leaves and because of its unusual habit
of stretching itself lengthwise on a tree branch or ledge where it is easily
confounded with a patch of lichen and thus overlooked If by accident one
happens upon a sleeping bird it suddenly rouses and flies away making no
more sound than a passing butterfly  a curious and uncanny silence that is
quite remarkable When the sun goes down and as the gloaming deepens the
birds activity increases and it begins its nightly duties emitting from
time to time like a sentry on his post or a watchman of the night the
doleful call which has given the bird its common name It

 Mourns unseen and ceaseless sings
 Ever a note of wail and woe

that our Dutch ancestors interpreted as Quotekerrkee and so called it
They had a tradition that no frost ever appeared after the bird had been heard
calling in the spring and that it wisely left for warmer skies before frost
came in the autumn Prudent bird never caught napping

It is erratic in its choice of habitations even when rock and solitude seem
suited to its taste Very rarely is this odd bird found close to the seashore
and in the Hudson River valley it keeps a half mile or more back from the
river

The eggs generally two in number are creamy white dashed with dark and
olive spots and laid on the ground on dry leaves or in a little hollow in
rock or stump  never in a nest built with loving care But in extenuation of
such carelessness it may be said that if disturbed or threatened the mother
shows no lack of maternal instinct and removes her young carrying them in
her beak as a cat conveys her kittens to secure shelter


NIGHTHAWK Chordeiles virginianus Goatsucker family

Called also NIGHTJAR BULLBAT MOSQUITO HAWK WILLOTHEWISP
 PISK PIRAMIDIG LONGWINGED GOATSUCKER COMMON NIGHTHAWK AOU
 1998

Length  9 to 10 inches About the same length as the robin but
 apparently much longer because of its very wide wingspread
Male and Female  Mottled blackish brown and rufous above with
 a multitude of creamyellow spots and dashes Lighter below
 with waving bars of brown on breast and underneath White mark
 on throat like an imperfect horseshoe also a band of white
 across tail of male bird These latter markings are wanting in
 female Heavy wings which are partly mottled are brown on
 shoulders and tips and longer than tail They have large white
 spots conspicuous in flight one of their distinguishing marks
 from the whippoorwill Head large and depressed with large
 eyes and earopenings Very small bill
Range  From Mexico to arctic islands
Migrations  May October Common summer resident

The nighthawks misleading name could not well imply more that the bird is
not it is not nocturnal in its habits neither is it a hawk for if it were
no account of it would be given in this book which distinctly excludes birds
of prey Stories of its chickenstealing prove to be ignorant rather than
malicious slanders Any one disliking the name however surely cannot
complain of a limited choice of other names by which in different sections of
the country it is quite as commonly known

Too often it is mistaken for the whippoorwill The night hawk does not have
the weird and woful cry of that more dismal bird but gives instead a harsh
whistling note while on the wing followed by a vibrating booming whirring
sound that Nuttall likens to the rapid turning of a spinning wheel or a
strong blowing into the bunghole of an empty hogshead This peculiar sound
is responsible for the name nightjar frequently given to this curious bird
It is said to be made as the bird drops suddenly through the air creating a
sort of stringed instrument of its outstretched wings and tail When these
wings are spread their large white spots running through the feathers to the
under side should be noted to further distinguish the nighthawk from the
whippoorwill which has none but which it otherwise closely resembles This
booming sound coming from such a height that the bird itself is often unseen
was said by the Indians to be made by the shad spirits to warn the scholes of
shad about to ascend the rivers to spawn in the spring of their impending
fate

The flight of the nighthawk is free and graceful in the extreme Soaring
through space without any apparent motion of its wings suddenly it darts with
amazing swiftness like an erratic bat after the fly mosquito beetle or moth
that falls within the range of its truly hawklike eye

Usually the nighthawks hunt in little companies in the most sociable fashion
Late in the summer they seem to be almost gregarious They fly in the early
morning or late afternoon with beak wide open hawking for insects but except
when the moon is full they are not known to go ahunting after sunset During
the heat of the day and at night they rest on limbs of trees fencerails
stone walls lichencovered rocks or old logs  wherever Nature has provided
suitable mimicry of their plumage to help conceal them

With this object in mind they quite as often choose a hollow surface of rock
in some waste pasture or the open ground on which to deposit the two
speckledgray eggs that sixteen days later will give birth to their family
But in August when family cares have ended for the season it is curious to
find this bird of the thickly wooded country readily adapting itself to city
life resting on Mansard roofs darting into the streets from the housetops
and wheeling about the electric lights making a hearty supper of the little
winged insects they attract


BLACKBILLED CUCKOO Coccyzus erythrophthalmus Cuckoo family

Called also RAIN CROW

Length  11 to 12 inches About onefifth larger than the robin
Male  Grayish brown above with bronze tint in feathers
 Underneath grayish white bill which is long as head and
 black arched and acute Skin about the eye bright red Tail
 long and with spots on tips of quills that are small and
 inconspicuous
Female  Has obscure dusky bars on the tail
Range  Labrador to Panama westward to Rocky Mountains
Migration  May September Summer resident

 O cuckoo shalt I call thee bird
 Or but a wandering voice

From the tangled shrubbery on the hillside back of Dove Cottage Keswick
where Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy listened for the coming of this
darling of the spring in the willows overhanging Shakespeares Avon from
the favorite haunts of Chaucer and Spenser where

 Runneth meade and springeth blede

we hear the cuckoo calling but how many on this side of the Atlantic are
familiar with its American counterpart Here too the cuckoo delights in
running water and damp cloudy weather like that of an English spring it
haunts the willows by our riversides where as yet no immortal bard arises
to give it fame It loud sings in our shrubbery too Indeed if we cannot
study our bird afield the next best place to become acquainted with it is in
the pages of the English poets But due allowance must be made for differences
of temperament Our cuckoo is scarcely a merry harbinger his talents such
as they are certainly are not musical However the guttural cluck is not
discordant and the blackbilled species at least has a soft mellow voice
that seems to indicate an embryonic songster

Kkkk kowkowowkowow is a familiar sound in many localities but the
large slim pigeonshaped brownisholive bird that makes it securely
hidden in the low trees and shrubs that are its haunts is not often
personally known Catching a glimpse only of the grayishwhite under parts
from where we stand looking up into the tree at it it is quite impossible to
tell the bird from the yellowbilled species When as it flies about we are
able to note the red circles about its eyes its black bill and the absence
of black tail feathers with their white thumbnail spots and see no bright
cinnamon feathers on the wings the yellowbilled species distinguishing
marks we can at last claim acquaintance with the blackbilled cuckoo Our
two common cuckoos are so nearly alike that they are constantly confused in
the popular mind and very often in the writings of ornithologists At first
glance the birds look alike Their haunts are almost identical their habits
are the same and as they usually keep well out of sight it is not
surprising if confusion arise

Neither cuckoo knows how to build a proper home a bunch of sticks dropped
carelessly into the bush where the hapless babies that emerge from the
greenish eggs will not have far to fall when they tumble out of bed as they
must inevitably do may by courtesy only be called a nest The cuckoo is said
to suck the eggs of other birds but surely such vice is only the rarest
dissipation Insects of many kinds and tent caterpillars chiefly are their
chosen food


YELLOWBILLED CUCKOO Coccyzus americanus Cuckoo family

Called also RAIN CROW

Length  11 to 12 inches About onefifth longer than the robin
Male and Female  Grayish brown above with bronze tint in
 feathers Underneath grayish white Bill which is as tong as
 head arched acute and more robust than the blackbilled
 species and with lower mandible yellow Wings washed with
 bright cinnamonbrown Tail has outer quills black
 conspicuously marked with white thumbnail spots
Female larger
Range  North America from Mexico to Labrador Most common in
temperate climates Rare on Pacific slope
Migrations  Late April September Summer resident

Kak kkuh kkuk kkuk like an exaggerated treetoads rattle is a sound
that when first heard makes you rush out of doors instantly to name the
bird Look for him in the depths of the tall shrubbery or low trees near
running water if there is any in the neighborhood and if you are more
fortunate than most people you will presently become acquainted with the
yellowbilled cuckoo When seen perching at a little distance his large slim
body grayish brown with olive tints above and whitish below can scarcely be
distinguished from that of the blackbilled species It is not until you get
close enough to note the yellow bill reddishbrown wings and black tail
feathers with their white thumbnail marks that you know which cuckoo you
are watching In repose the bird looks dazed or stupid but as it darts about
among the trees after insects noiselessly slipping to another one that
promises better results and hopping along the limbs after performing a series
of beautiful evolutions among the branches as it hunts for its favorite tent
caterpillars it appears what it really is an unusually active graceful
intelligent bird

A solitary wanderer nevertheless one cuckoo in an apple orchard is worth a
hundred robins in ridding it of caterpillars and inchworms for it delights
in killing many more of these than it can possibly eat In the autumn it
varies its diet with minute freshwater shellfish from the swamp and lake
Mulberries that look so like caterpillars the bird possibly likes them on
that account it devours wholesale

Family cares rest lightly on the cuckoos The nest of both species is a
ramshackle affair  a mere bundle of twigs and sticks without a rim to keep
the eggs from rolling from the bush where they rest to the ground Unlike
their European relative they have the decency to rear their own young and not
impose this heavy task on others but the cuckoos on both sides of the
Atlantic are most erratic and irregular in their nesting habits The
overworked motherbird often lays an egg while brooding over its nearly
hatched companion and the two or three halfgrown fledglings already in the
nest may roll the large greenish eggs out upon the ground while both parents
are off searching for food to quiet their noisy clamorings Such distracting
mismanagement in the nursery is enough to make a homeless wanderer of any
father It is the motherbird that tumbles to the ground at your approach from
sheer fright feigns lameness trails her wings as she tries to entice you
away from the nest The male bird shows far less concern a no more devoted
father we fear than he is a lover It is said he changes his mate every
year

Altogether the cuckoo is a very different sort of bird from what our fancy
pictured The little Swiss creatures of wood that fly out of the doors of
clocks and call out the bedhour to sleepy children are chiefly responsible
for the false impressions of our mature years The American bird does not
repeat its name and its harsh grating kuk kuk does not remotely suggest
the sweet voice of its European relative


BANK SWALLOW Clivicola riparia Swallow family

Called also SAND MARTIN SAND SWALLOW

Length  5 to 55 inches About an inch shorter than the English
 sparrow but apparently much larger because of its wide
 wingspread
Male and Female  Grayish brown or claycolored above Upper
 wings and tail darkest Below white with brownish band
 across chest Tail which is rounded and more nearly square
 than the other swallows is obscurely edged with white
Range  Throughout North America south of Hudson Bay
Migrations  April October Summer resident

Where a brook cuts its way through a sand bank to reach the sea is an ideal
nesting ground for a colony of sand martins The face of the high bank shows a
number of clean round holes indiscriminately bored into the sand as if the
place had just received a cannonading but instead of war an atmosphere of
peace pervades the place in midsummer when you are most likely to visit it
Now that the young ones have flown from their nests that your arm can barely
reach through the tunnelled sand or clay there can be little harm in
examining the feathers dropped from gulls ducks and other waterbirds with
which the grassy home is lined

The bank swallows nest like the kingfishers which it resembles is his
home as well There he rests when tired of flying about in pursuit of insect
food Perhaps a bird that has been resting in one of the tunnels startled by
your innocent housebreaking will fly out across your face near enough for
you to see how unlike the other swallows he is smaller plainer and with
none of their glinting steelblues and buffs about him With strong swift
flight he rejoins his fellows wheeling skimming darting through the air
above you and uttering his characteristic giggling twitter that is one of
the cheeriest noises heard along the beach In early October vast numbers of
these swallows may be seen in loose flocks along the Jersey coast slowly
making their way South Clouds of them miles in extent are recorded

Closely associated with the sand martin is the Roughwinged Swallow
Stelgidopteryx serripennis not to be distinguished from its companion on
the wing but easily recognized by its dullgray throat and the absence of the
brown breastband when seen at close range


CEDAR BIRD Ampelis cedrorum Waxwing family

Called also CEDAR WAXWING AOU 1998 CHERRYBIRD CANADA ROBIN RECOLLET

Length  7 to 8 inches About onefifth smaller than the robin
Male  Upper parts rich grayish brown with plumcolored tints
 showing through the brown on crest throat breast wings and
 tail A velvetyblack line on forehead runs through the eye and
 back of crest Chin black crest conspicuous breast lighter
 than the back and shading into yellow underneath Wings have
 quillshafts of secondaries elongated and with brilliant
 vermilion tips like drops of sealingwax rarely seen on tail
 quills which have yellow bands across the end
Female  With duller plumage smaller crest and narrower
 tailband
Range  North America from northern British provinces to
 Central America in winter
Migrations  A roving resident without fixed seasons for
 migrating

As the cedar birds travel about in great flocks that quickly exhaust their
special food in a neighborhood they necessarily lead a nomadic life  here
today gone tomorrow  and like the Arabs they silently steal away It
is surprising how very little noise so great a company of these birds make at
any time That is because they are singularly gentle and refined soft of
voice as they are of color their plumage suggesting a fine Japanese
watercolor painting on silk with its beautiful sheen and exquisitely blended
tints

One listens in vain for a song only a lisping Tweetweeze or a dreary
whisper as Minot calls their lowtoned communications with each other
reaches our ears from their high perches in the cedar trees where they sit
almost motionless hours at a time digesting the enormous quantities of
juniper and whortleberries wild cherries worms and insects upon which they
have gormandized

Nuttall gives the cedar birds credit for excessive politeness to each other
He says he has often seen them passing a worm from one to another down a whole
row of beaks and back again before it was finally eaten

When nesting time arrives  that is to say towards the end of the summer 
they give up their gregarious habits and live in pairs billing and kissing
like turtledoves in the orchard or wild crabtrees where a flat bulky nest
is rather carelessly built of twigs grasses feathers strings  any odds
and ends that may be lying about The eggs are usually four white tinged with
purple and spotted with black

Apparently they have no moulting season their plumage is always the same
beautifully neat and fullfeathered Nothing ever hurries or flusters them
their greatest concern apparently being when they alight to settle
themselves comfortably between their overpolite friends who are never guilty
of jolting or crowding Few birds care to take life so easily not to say
indolently

Among the French Canadians they are called Recollet from the color of their
crest resembling the hood of the religious order of that name Every region
the birds pass through local names appear to be applied to them a few of the
most common of which are given above

Of the three waxwings known to scientists two are found in America and the
third in Japan


BROWN CREEPER Certhia familiaris americana Creeper family

Length  5 to 575 inches A little smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Brown above varied with ashygray stripes and
 small lozengeshaped gray mottles Color lightest on head
 increasing in shade to reddish brown near tail Tail paler
 brown and long wings brown and barred with whitish Beneath
 grayish white Slender curving bill
Range  United States and Canada east of Rocky Mountains
Migrations  April September Winter resident

This little brown wood sprite the very embodiment of virtuous diligence is
never found far from the nuthatches titmice and kinglets though not
strictly in their company for he is a rather solitary bird Possibly he
repels them by being too exasperatingly conscientious

Beginning at the bottom of a roughbarked tree for a smooth bark conceals no
larvae the creeper silently climbs upward in a sort of spiral now lost to
sight on the opposite side of the tree then reappearing just where he is
expected to flitting back a foot or two perhaps lest he overlooked a single
spider egg but never by any chance leaving a tree until conscience approves
of his thoroughness And yet with all this painstaking workmans care it
takes him just about fifty seconds to finish a tree Then off he flits to the
base of another to repeat the spiral process Only rarely does he adopt the
woodpecker process of partly flitting partly rocking his way with the help of
his tail straight up one side of the tree

Yet this little bird is not altogether the soulless drudge he appears In the
midst of his work uncheered by summer sunshine and clinging with numb toes
to the treetrunk some bitter cold day he still finds some tender emotion
within him to voice in a wild sweet song that is positively enchanting at
such a time But it is not often this song is heard south of his nesting
grounds

The brown creepers plumage is one of Natures most successful feats of
mimicry  an exact counterfeit in feathers of the browngray bark on which
the bird lives And the protective coloring is carried out in the nest
carefully tucked under a piece of loosened bark in the very heart of the tree


PINE SISKIN Spinus pinus Finch family

Called also PINE FINCH PINE LINNET

Length  475 to 5 inches Over an inch smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Olivebrown and gray above much streaked and
 striped with very dark brown everywhere Darkest on head and
 back Lower back base of tail and wing feathers pale
 sulphuryellow Under parts very light buff brown heavily
 streaked
Range  North America generally Most common in north latitudes
 Winters south to the Gulf of Mexico
Migrations  Erratic winter visitor from October to April
 Uncommon in summer

A small grayishbrown brindle bird relieved with touches of yellow on its
back wings and tail may be seen some winter morning roving on the lawn from
one evergreen tree to another clinging to the pine cones and peering
attentively between the scales before extracting the kernels It utters a
callnote so like the English sparrows that you are surprised when you look
up into the tree to find it comes from a stranger The pine siskin is an
erratic visitor and there is always the charm of the unexpected about its
coming near our houses that heightens our enjoyment of its brief stay

As it flies downward from the top of the spruce tree to feed upon the brown
seeds still clinging to the pigweed and goldenrod stalks sticking out above
the snow by the roadside it dips and floats through the air like its charming
little cousin the goldfinch They have several characteristics in common
besides their flight and their fondness for thistles Far at the north where
the pine siskin nests in the top of the evergreens his sweetwarbled
lovesong is said to be like that of our wild canarys only with a
suggestion of fretfulness in the tone

Occasionally some one living in an Adirondack or other mountain camp reports
finding the nest and hearing the siskin sing even in midsummer but it is
nevertheless considered a northern species however its erratic habits may
sometimes break through the ornithologists traditions


SMITHS PAINTED LONGSPUR Calcarius pictus Finch family

Called also SMITHS LONGSPUR AOU 1998

Length  65 inches About the size of a large English sparrow
Male and Female  Upper parts marked with black brown and
 white like a sparrow brown predominant Male bird with more
 black about head shoulders and tail feathers and a whitish
 patch edged with black under the eye Underneath pale brown
 shading to buff Hind claw or spur conspicuous
Range  Interior of North America from the arctic coast to
 Illinois and and Texas Migrations  Winter visitor Without
 fixed season

Confined to a narrower range than the Lapland longspur this bird quite
commonly found on the open prairie districts of the middle West in winter is
nevertheless so very like its cousin that the same description of their
habits might very well answer for both Indeed both these birds are often
seen in the same flock Larks and the ubiquitous sparrows too intermingle
with them with the familiarity that only the starvation rations of midwinter
and not true sociability can effect and looking out upon such a
heterogeneous flock of brown birds as they are feeding together on the frozen
ground only the trained field ornithologist would find it easy to point out
the painted longspurs

Certain peculiarities are noticeable however Longspurs squat while resting
then when flushed they run quickly and lightly and rise with a sharp
click repeated several times in quick succession and move with an easy
undulating motion for a short distance when they alight very suddenly
seeming to fall perpendicularly several feet to the ground Another
peculiarity of their flight is their habit of flying about in circles to and
fro keeping up a constant chirping or call It is only in the mating season
when we rarely hear them that the longspurs have the angelic manner of
singing as they fly like the skylark The colors of the males among the
several longspurs may differ widely but the indistinctly marked females are
so like each other that only their mates perhaps could tell them apart


LAPLAND LONGSPUR Calcarius lapponicus Finch family

Called also LAPLAND SNOWBIRD LAPLAND LARK BUNTING

Length  65 to 7 inches trifle larger than the English sparrow
Male  Color varies with season Winter plumage Top of head
 black with rusty markings all feathers being tipped with
 white Behind and below the eye rusty black Breast and
 underneath grayish white faintly streaked with black Above
 reddish brown with black markings Feet which are black have
 conspicuous long hind claws or spur
Female  Rusty gray above less conspicuously marked Whitish
 below
Range  Circumpolar regions northern United States occasional
 in Middle States abundant in winter as far as Kansas and the
 Rocky Mountains
Migrations  Winter visitors rarely resident and without a
 Fixed season

This arctic bird although considered somewhat rare with us when seen at all
in midwinter is in such large flocks that before its visit in the
neighborhood is ended and because there are so few other birds about it
becomes delightfully familiar as it nimbly runs over the frozen ground
picking up grain that has blown about from the barn when the seeds of the
field are buried under snow This lack of fear through sharp hunger that
often drives the shyest of the birds to our very doors in winter is as
pathetic as it is charming Possibly it is not so rare a bird as we think for
it is often mistaken for some of the sparrows the shore larks and the snow
buntings that it not only resembles but whose company it frequently keeps
or for one of the other longspurs

At all seasons of the year a ground bird you may readily identify the Lapland
longspur by its tracks through the snow showing the mark of the long hind
claw or spur In summer we know little or nothing about it for with the
coming of the flowers it is off to the far north where we are told it
depresses its nest in a bed of moss upon the ground and lines it with fur
shed from the coat of the arctic fox


CHIPPING SPARROW Spizella socialis Finch family

Called also CHIPPY HAIRBIRD CHIPBIRD SOCIAL SPARROW

Length  5 to 55 inches An inch shorter than the English
 sparrow
Male  Under the eye on the back of the neck underneath and
 on the lower back ashgray Gray stripe over the eye and a
 blackish brown one apparently through it Dark redbrown crown
 Back brown slightly rufous and feathers streaked with black
 Wings and tail dusty brown Wingbars not conspicuous Bill
 black
Female  Lacks the chestnut color on the crown which is
 Streaked with black In winter the frontlet is black Bill
 brownish
Range  North America from Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico
 And westward to the Rockies Winters in Gulf States and Mexico
 Most common in eastern United States
Migrations  April October Common summer resident many birds
 remaining all the year from southern New England southward

Who does not know this humblest most unassuming little neighbor that comes
hopping to our very doors this mite of a bird with one talent that it so
persistently uses all the day and every day throughout the summer Its high
wiry trill like the buzzing of the locust heard in the dawn before the sky
grows even gray or in the middle of the night starts the morning chorus and
after all other voices are hushed in the evening its tremolo is the last
bedsong to come from the trees But however monotonous such cheerfulness
sometimes becomes when we are surfeited with real songs from dozens of other
throats there are long periods of midsummer silence that it punctuates most
acceptably

Its callnote chip chip from which several of its popular names are
derived is altogether different from the trill which must do duty as a song
to express love contentment everything that so amiable a little nature might
feel impelled to voice

But with all its virtues the chippy shows lamentable weakness of character in
allowing its grown children to impose upon it as it certainly does In every
group of these birds throughout the summer we can see young ones which we may
know by the black linestripes on their breasts hopping around after their
parents that are often no larger or more ablebodied than they and teasing
to be fed drooping their wings to excite pity for a helplessness that they do
not possess when the weary little mother hops away from them and still
persistently chirping for food until she weakly relents returns to them
picks a seed from the ground and thrusts it down the bill of the sauciest
teaser in the group With two such broods in a season the chestnut feathers on
the fathers jaunty head might well turn gray

Unlike most of the sparrows the little chippy frequents high trees where its
nest is built quite as often as in the low bushes of the garden The
horsehair which always lines the grass up that holds its greenishblue
speckled eggs is alone responsible for the name hairbird and not the
chippys hairlike trill as some suppose


ENGLISH SPARROW Passer domesticus Finch family

Called also HOUSE SPARROW AOU 1998

Length  633 inches
Male  Ashy above with black and chestnut stripes on back and
 shoulders Wings have chestnut and white bar bordered by faint
 black line Gray crown bordered from the eye backward and on
 the nape by chestnut Middle of throat and breast black
 Underneath grayish white
Female  Paler wingbars indistinct and without the black
 marking on throat and breast
Range  Around the world Introduced and naturalized in America
 Australia New Zealand
Migrations  Constant resident

Of course no selfrespecting ornithologist will condescend to enlarge his
list by counting in the English sparrow  too pestiferous to mention writes
Mr H E Parkhurst and yet of all bird neighbors is any one more within the
scope of this book than the audacious little gamin that delights in the
companion ship of humans even in their most noisy city thoroughfares

In a bulletin issued by the Department of Agriculture it is shown that the
progeny of a single pair of these sparrows might amount to 275716983698 in
ten years Inasmuch as many pairs were liberated in the streets of Brooklyn
New York in 1851 when the first importation was made the day is evidently
not far off when these birds by no means meek shall inherit the earth

In Australia Scotch thistles English sparrows and rabbits three most
unfortunate importations have multiplied with equal rapidity until serious
alarm fills the minds of the colonists But in England a special committee
appointed by the House of Commons to investigate the character of the alleged
pest has yet to learn whether the sparrows services as an insectdestroyer do
not outweigh the injury it does to fruit and grain


FIELD SPARROW Spizella pusilla Finch family

Called also FIELD BUNTING WOOD SPARROW BUSH SPARROW

Length  55 to 575 inches A little smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Chestnut crown Upper back bright chestnut finely
 streaked with black and ashy brown Lower back more grayish
 Whitish wingbars Cheeks line over the eye throat pale
 brownish drab Tail long Underneath grayish white tinged with
 palest buff on breast and sides Bill reddish
Female  Paler the crown edged with grayish
Range  North America from British provinces to the Gulf and
 westward to the plains Winters from Illinois and Virginia
 southward Migrations  April November Common summer
 resident

Simply because both birds have chestnut crowns the field sparrow is often
mistaken for the dapper sociable chippy and no doubt because it loves such
heathery grassy pastures as are dear to the vesper sparrow and has bay wings
and a sweet song these two cousins also are often confused The field sparrow
has a more reddishbrown upper back than any of its small relatives the
absence of streaks on its breast and of the white tail quills so conspicuous
in the vesper sparrows flight sufficiently differentiate the two birds
while the red bill of the field sparrow is a positive mark of identification

This bird of humble nature that makes the scrubby pastures and uplands
tuneful from early morning until after sunset flies away with exasperating
shyness as you approach Alighting on a convenient branch he lures you on
with his clear sweet song Follow him and he only hops about from bush to
bush farther and farther away singing as he goes a variety of strains which
is one of the birds peculiarities The song not only varies in individuals
but in different localities which may be one reason why no two ornithologists
record it alike Doubtless the chief reason for the amusing differences in the
syllables into which the songs of birds are often translated in the books is
that the same Notes actually sound differently to different individuals Thus
to people in Massachusetts the whitethroated sparrow seems to say
Peabody Peabody Peabody while good British subjects beyond the New
England border hear him sing quite distinctly Sweet Canada Canada
Canada But however the opinions as to the syllables of the field sparrows
song may differ all are agreed as to its exquisite quality that resembles
the vesper sparrows tender sweet melody The song begins with three soft
wild whistles and ends with a series of trills and quavers that gradually
melt away into silence a serene and restful strain as soothing as a hymn
Like the vesper sparrows these birds sometimes build a plain grassy nest
unprotected by over hanging bush flat upon the ground Possibly from a
prudent tear of fieldmice and snakes the little mother most frequently lays
her bluishwhite rufous  marked eggs in a nest placed in a bush of a bushy
field Hence John Burroughs has called the bird the bush sparrow


FOX SPARROW Passerella ilica Finch family

Called also FOXCOLORED SPARROW FERRUGINOUS FINCH FOXY FINCH

Length  65 to 725 inches Nearly an inch longer than the
 English sparrow
Male and Female  Upper parts reddish brown varied with ash
 gray brightest on lower back wings and tail Bluish slate
 about the head Underneath whitish the throat breast and
 sides heavily marked with arrowheads and oblong dashes of
 reddish brown and blackish
Range  Alaska and Manitoba to southern United States Winters
 chiefly south of Illinois and Virginia Occasional stragglers
 remain north most of the winter
Migrations  March November Most common in the migrations

There will be little difficulty in naming this largest most plump and reddish
of all the sparrows whose foxcolored feathers rather than any malicious
cunning of its disposition are responsible for the name it bears The male
bird is incomparably the finest singer of its gifted family His faint tseep
callnote gives no indication of his vocal powers that some bleak morning in
early March suddenly send a thrill of pleasure through you It is the most
welcome glad surprise of all the spring Without a preliminary twitter or
throatclearing of any sort the full rich luscious tones with just a tinge
of plaintiveness in them are poured forth with spontaneous abandon Such a
song at such a time is enough to summon anybody with a musical ear out of
doors under the leaden skies to where the delicious notes issue from the
leafless shrubbery by the roadside Watch the singer until the song ends when
he will quite likely descend among the dead leaves on the ground and scratch
among them like any barnyard fowl but somehow contriving to use both feet at
once in the operation as no chicken ever could He seems to take special
delight in damp thickets where the insects with which he varies his seed diet
are plentiful

Usually the fox sparrows keep in small loose flocks apart by themselves for
they are not truly gregarious but they may sometimes be seen travelling in
company with their whitethroated cousins They are among the last birds to
leave us in the late autumn or winter Mr Bicknell says that they seem
indisposed to sing unless present in numbers Indeed they are little inclined
to absolute solitude at any time for even in the nesting season quite a
colony of grassy nurseries may be found in the same meadow and small
companies haunt the roadside shrubbery during the migrations


GRASSHOPPER SPARROW Ammodramus savannarum passerinus Finch
 family

Called also YELLOWWINGED SPARROW

Length  5 to 54 inches About an inch smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  A creamyellow line over the eye centre of
 crown shoulders and lesser wing coverts yellowish Head
 blackish rustcolored feathers with small black spots on back
 of the neck an orange mark before the eye All other upper
 parts varied red brown cream and black with a drab wash
 Underneath brownish drab on breast shading to soiled white
 and without streaks Dusky even pointed tail feathers have
 grayishwhite outer margins
Range  Eastern North America from British provinces to Cuba
 Winters south of the Carolinas
Migrations  April October Common summer resident

It is safe to say that no other common bird is so frequently overlooked as
this little sparrow that keeps persistently to the grass and low bushes and
only faintly lifts up a weak wiry voice that is usually attributed to some
insect At the bend of the wings only are the feathers really yellow and even
this bright shade often goes unnoticed as the bird runs shyly through an old
dairy field or grassy pasture You may all but step upon it before it takes
wing and exhibits itself on the fencerail which is usually as far from the
ground as it cares to go If you are near enough to this perch you may
overhear the zeeeeeeeee that has earned it the name of grasshopper
sparrow If you persistently follow it too closely away it flies then
suddenly drops to the ground where a scrubby bush affords protection A
curious fact about this bird is that after you have once become acquainted
with it you find that instead of being a rare discovery as you had supposed
it is apt to be a common resident of almost every field you walk through


SAVANNA SPARROW Ammodramus sandwichensis savanna Finch family

Called also SAVANNA BUNTING

Length  55 to 6 inches A trifle smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Cheeks space over the eye and on the bend of
 the wings pale yellow General effect of the upper parts
 brownish drab streaked with black Wings and tail dusky the
 outer webs of the feathers margined with buff Under parts
 white heavily streaked with blackish and rufous the marks on
 breast feathers being wedgeshaped In the autumn the plumage
 is often suffused with a yellow tinge
Range  Eastern North America from Hudson Bay to Mexico
 Winters south of Illinois and Virginia
Migrations  April October A few remain in sheltered marshes
 at the north all winter

Look for the savanna sparrow in salt marshes marshy or upland pastures never
far inland and if you see a sparrowy bird unusually white and heavily
streaked beneath and with pale yellow markings about the eye and on the bend
of the wing you may still make several guesses at its identity before the
weak little insectlike trill finally establishes it Whoever can correctly
name every sparrow and warbler on sight is a person to be envied if indeed
he exists at all

In the lowlands of Nova Scotia and in fact of all the maritime provinces
this sparrow is the one that is perhaps most commonly seen Every fencerail
has one perched upon it singing Ptsip ptsip ptsip zeeeee close to
the ear of the passerby who otherwise might not hear the low
grasshopperlike song At the north the bird somehow loses the shyness that
makes it comparatively little known farther south Depending upon the scrub
and grass to conceal it you may almost tread upon it before it startles you
by its sudden rising with a whirring noise only to drop to the ground again
just a few yards farther away where it scuds among the underbrush and is lost
to sight Tall weeds and fencerails are as high and exposed situations as it
is likely to select while singing It is most distinctively a ground bird and
flat upon the pasture or in a slightly hollowed cup it has the merest apology
for a nest Only a few wisps of grass are laid in the cavity to receive the
palegreen eggs that are covered most curiously with blotches of brown of
many shapes and tints


SEASIDE SPARROW Ammodramus maritimus Finch family

Called also MEADOW CHIPPY SEASIDE FINCH

Length  6 inches A shade smaller than the English sparrow
Male and Female  Upper parts dusky grayish or olivaceous brown
 inclining to gray on shoulders and on edges of some feathers
 Wings and tail darkest Throat yellowish white shading to gray
 on breast which is indistinctly mottled and streaked A yellow
 spot before the eye and on bend of the wing the birds
 characteristic marks Blunt tail
Range  Atlantic seaboard from Georgia northward Usually
 Winters south of Virginia
Migrations  April November A few remain in sheltered marshes
 all winter

The savanna the swamp the sharptailed and the song sparrows may all
sometimes be found in the haunts of the seaside sparrow but you may be
certain of finding the latter nowhere else than in the salt marshes within
sight or sound of the sea It is a dingy little bird with the least definite
coloring of all the sparrows that have maritime inclinations with no rufous
tint in its feathers and less distinct streakings on the breast than any of
them It has no black markings on the back

Goodsized flocks of seaside sparrows live together in the marshes but they
spend so much of their time on the ground running about among the reeds and
grasses whose seeds and insect parasites they feed upon that not until some
unusual disturbance in the quiet place flushes them does the intruder suspect
their presence Hunters after beachbirds longshoremen seaside cottagers
and whoever follows the windings of a creek through the salt meadows to catch
crabs and eels in midsummer are well acquainted with the meadow chippies
as the fishermen call them They keep up a good deal of chirping
sparrowfashion and have four or five notes resembling a song that is usually
delivered from a tall reed stalk where the bird sways and balances until his
husky performance has ended when down he drops upon the ground out of sight
Sometimes too these notes are uttered while the bird flutters in the air
above the tops of the sedges


SHARPTAILED SPARROW Ammodramus caudacutus Finch family

Length  525 to 585 inches A trifle smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Upper parts brownish or grayish olive the
 back with black streaks and gray edges to some feathers A
 gray line through centre of crown which has maroon stripes
 gray ears enclosed by buff lines one of which passes through
 the eye and one on side of throat brownish orange or buff on
 sides of head Bend of the wing yellow Breast and sides pale
 buff distinctly streaked with black Underneath whitish Each
 narrow quill of tail is sharply pointed the outer ones
 shortest
Range  Atlantic coast Winters south of Virginia
Migrations  April November Summer resident

This bird delights in the company of the dullcolored seaside sparrow whose
haunts in the salt marshes it frequents especially the drier parts but its
pointed tailquills and more distinct markings are sufficient to prevent
confusion Mr J Dwight Jr who has made a special study of maritime birds
says of it It runs about among the reeds and grasses with the celerity of a
mouse and it is not apt to take wing unless closely pressed Wilson
credited it with the nimbleness of a sandpiper It builds its nest in the
tussocks on the bank of a ditch or in the drift left by the tide rather than
in the grassier sites chosen by its neighbors the seaside sparrows

Only rarely does one get a glimpse of this shy little bird that darts out of
sight like a flash at the first approach Balancing on a cattail stalk or
perched upon a bit of driftwood it makes a feeble husky attempt to sing a
few notes and during the brief performance the operaglasses may search it
out successfully While it feeds upon the bits of seafood washed ashore to
the edge of the marshes it gives us perhaps the best chance we ever get
outside of a museum to study the birds characteristics of plumage

Both the sharptailed and the seaside finches are crepuscular says Dr
Abbott in The Birds About Us They run up and down the reeds and on the
waters edge long after most birds have gone to sleep


SONG SPARROW Melospiza fasciata Finch family

Length  6 to 65 inches About the same size as the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Brown head with three longitudinal gray bands
 Brown stripe on sides of throat Brownishgray back streaked
 With rufous Underneath gray shading to white heavily
 streaked with darkest brown A black spot on breast Wings
 without bars Tail plain grayish brown
Range  North America from Fur Countries to the Gulf States
 Winters from southern Illinois and Massachusetts to the Gulf
Migrations  March November A few birds remain at the north
 All the year

Here is a veritable bird neighbor if ever there was one at home in our
gardens and hedges not often farther away than the roadside abundant
everywhere during nearly every month in the year and yet was there ever one
too many There is scarcely an hour in the day too when its delicious
ecstatic song may not be heard in the darkness of midnight just before dawn
when its voice is almost the first to respond to the chipping sparrows wiry
trill and the robins warble in the cool of the morning the heat of noon
the hush of evening  ever the simple homely sweet melody that every good
American has learned to love in childhood What the bird lacks in beauty it
abundantly makes up in good cheer Not at all retiring though never bold it
chooses some conspicuous perch on a bush or tree to deliver its outburst of
song and sings away with serene unconsciousness Its artlessness is charming
Thoreau writes in his Summer that the country girls in Massachusetts hear
the bird say Maids maids maids hang on your teakettle
teakettleettleettle The callnote a metallic chip is equally
characteristic of the birds irrepressible vivacity It has still another
musical expression however a song more prolonged and varied than its usual
performance that it seems to sing only on the wing

Of course the song sparrow must sometimes fly upward but whoever sees it fly
anywhere but downward into the thicket that it depends upon to conceal it from
too close inspection By pumping its tail as it flies it seems to acquire
more than the ordinary sparrows velocity

Its nest which is likely to be laid flat on the ground except where
fieldmice are plentiful in which case it is elevated into the crotch of a
bush is made of grass strips of bark and leaves and lined with finer
grasses and hair Sometimes three broods may be reared in a season but even
the cares of providing insects and seeds enough for so many hungry babies
cannot altogether suppress the cheerful singer The eggs are grayish white
speckled and clouded with lavender and various shades of brown

In sparsely settled regions the song sparrows seem to show a fondness for
moist woodland thickets possibly because their tastes are insectivorous But
it is difficult to imagine the friendly little musician anything but a
neighbor


SWAMP SONG SPARROW Melospiza georgiana Finch family

Called also SWAMP SPARROW AOU 1998 MARSH SPARROW RED
 GRASSBIRD SWAMP FINCH

Length  5 to 58 inches A little smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Forehead black crown which in winter has black stripes
 is always bright bay line over the eye sides of the neck
 gray Back brown striped with various shades Wing edges and
 tail reddish brown Mottled gray underneath inclining to white
 on the chin
Female  Without black forehead and stripes on head
Range  North America from Texas to Labrador
Migrations  April October A few winter at the north

In just such impenetrable retreats as the marsh wrens choose another wee
brown bird may sometimes be seen springing up from among the sedges singing a
few sweet notes as it flies and floats above them and then suddenly
disappearing into the grassy tangle It is too small and its breast is not
streaked enough to be a song sparrow neither are their songs alike it has
not the wrens peculiarities of bill and tail Its brightbay crown and
sparrowy markings finally identify it A suggestion of the birds watery home
shows itself in the liquid quality of its simple sweet note stronger and
sweeter than the chippys and repeated many times almost like a trill that
seems to trickle from the marsh in a little rivulet of song The sweetness is
apt to become monotonous to all but the bird itself that takes evident
delight in its performance In the spring when flocks of swamp sparrows come
north how they enliven the marshes and waste places And yet the song simple
as it is is evidently not uttered altogether without effort if the
tailspreading and teetering of the body after the manner of the ovenbird are
any indications of exertion

Nuttall says of these birds They thread their devious way with the same
alacrity as the rail with whom indeed they are often associated in
neighborhood In consequence of this perpetual brushing through sedge and
bushes their feathers are frequently so worn that their tails appear almost
like those of rats

But the swamp sparrows frequently belie their name and especially in the
South live in dry fields wornout pasture lands with scrubby weedy patches
in them They live upon seeds of grasses and berries but Dr Abbott has
detected their special fondness for fish  not fresh fish particularly but
rather such as have lain in the sun for a few days and become dry as a chip
Their nest is placed on the ground sometimes in a tussock of grass or roots
of an upturned tree quite surrounded by water Four or five soiled white eggs
with reddishbrown spots are laid usually twice in 2 season


TREE SPARROW Spizella monticola Finch family

Called also CANADA SPARROW WINTER CHIPPY TREE BUNTING WINTER
 CHIPBIRD ARCTIC CHIPPER

Length  6 to 635 inches About the same size as the English
 sparrow
Male  Crown of head bright chestnut Line over the eye cheeks
 throat and breast gray the breast with an indistinct black
 spot on centre Brown back the feathers edged with black and
 buff Lower back pale grayish brown Two whitish bars across
 dusky wings tail feathers bordered with grayish white
 Underneath whitish
Female  Smaller and less distinctly marked
Range  North America from Hudson Bay to the Carolinas and
 westward to the plains
Migrations  October April Winter resident

A revised and enlarged edition of the friendly little chipping sparrow that
hops to our very doors for crumbs throughout the mild weather comes out of
British America at the beginning of winter to dissipate much of the winters
dreariness by his cheerful twitterings Why he should have been called a tree
sparrow is a mystery unless because he does not frequent trees
 a reason with sufficient plausibility to commend the name to several of
the early ornithologists who not infrequently called a bird precisely what it
was not The tree sparrow actually does not show half the preference for trees
that its familiar little counterpart does but rather keeps to low bushes when
not on the ground where we usually find it It does not crouch upon the
ground like the chippy but with a lordly carriage holds itself erect as it
nimbly runs over the frozen crust Sheltered from the high wintry winds in
the furrows and dry ditches of ploughed fields a loose flock of these active
birds keep up a merry hunt for fallen seeds and berries with a belated beetle
to give the grain a relish As you approach the feeding ground one bird gives
a shrill alarmcry and instantly five times as many birds as you suspected
were in the field take wing and settle down in the scrubby undergrowth at the
edge of the woods or by the wayside No still cold seems too keen for them to
go aforaging but when cutting winds blow through the leafless thickets the
scattered remnants of a flock seek the shelter of stone walls hedges barns
and cozy nooks about the house and garden It is in midwinter that these
birds grow most neighborly although even then they are distinctly less
sociable than their small chippy cousins

By the first of March when the fox sparrow and the bluebird attract the
lions share of attention by their superior voices we not infrequently are
deaf to the modest sweet little strain that answers for the tree sparrows
lovesong Soon after the bird is in full voice away it goes with its flock
to their nesting ground in Labrador or the Hudson Bay region It builds
either on the ground or not far from it a nest of grasses rootlets and
hair without which no true chippy counts its home complete


VESPER SPARROW Poocaetes gramineus Finch family

Called also BAYWINGED BUNTING GRASSFINCH GRASSBIRD

Length  575 to 625 inches A little smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Brown above streaked and varied with gray
 Lesser wing coverts bright rufous Throat and breast whitish
 striped with dark brown Underneath plain soiled white Outer
 tailquills which are its special mark of identification are
 partly white but apparently wholly white as the bird flies
Range  North America especially common in eastern parts from
 Hudson Bay to Gulf of Mexico Winters south of Virginia
Migrations  April October Common summer resident

Among the least conspicuous birds sparrows are the easiest to classify for
that very reason and certain prominent features of the half dozen commonest
of the tribe make their identification simple even to the merest novice The
distinguishing marks of this sparrow that haunts open breezy pasture lands
and country waysides are its bright reddishbrown wing coverts prominent
among its dingy pale brownishgray feathers and its white tailquills shown
as the bird flies along the road ahead of you to light upon the fencerail It
rarely flies higher even to sing its serene pastoral strain restful as the
twilight of which indeed it seems to be the vocal expression How different
from the ecstatic outburst of the song sparrow Pensive but not sad its
longdrawn silvery notes continue in quavers that float off unended like a
trail of mist The song is suggestive of the thoughts that must come at
evening to some New England saint of humble station after a wellspent
souluplifting day

But while the vesper sparrow sings oftenest and most sweetly in the late
afternoon and continues singing until only he and the rosebreasted grosbeak
break the silence of the early night his is one of the first voices to join
the morning chorus No early worm however tempts him from his grassy nest
for the seeds in the pasture lands and certain tiny insects that live among
the grass furnish meals at all hours He simply delights in the cool still
morning and evening hours and in giving voice to his enjoyment of them

The vesper sparrow is preeminently a grassbird It first opens its eyes on
the world in a nest neatly woven of grasses laid on the ground among the
grass that shelters it and furnishes it with food and its protective coloring
Only the grazing cattle know how many nests and birds are hidden in their
pastures Like the meadowlarks their presence is not even suspected until a
flock is flushed from its feeding ground only to return to the spot when you
have passed on your way Like the meadowlark again the vesper sparrow
occasionally sings as it soars upward from its grassy home


WHITECROWNED SPARROW Zonotrichia leucophrys Finch family

Length  7 inches A little larger than the English sparrow
Male  White head with four longitudinal black lines marking
 off a crown the blackandwhite stripes being of about equal
 width Cheeks nape and throat gray Light gray underneath
 with some buff tints Back dark grayish brown some feathers
 margined with gray Two interrupted white bars across wings
 Plain dusky tail total effect a clear ashen gray
Female  With rusty head inclining to gray on crown Paler
 throughout than the male
Range  From high mountain ranges of western United States more
 rarely on Pacific slope to Atlantic Ocean and from Labrador
 to Mexico Chiefly south of Pennsylvania
Migrations  October April Irregular migrant in Northern
 States A winter resident elsewhere

The large size and handsome markings of this aristocraticlooking Northern
sparrow would serve to distinguish him at once did he not often consort with
his equally finelooking whitethroated cousins while migrating and so too
often get overlooked Sparrows are such gregarious birds that it is well to
scrutinize every flock with especial care in the spring and autumn when the
rarer migrants are passing This bird is more common in the high altitudes of
the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains than elsewhere in the United States
There in the lonely forest it nests in low bushes or on the ground and sings
its full love song as it does in the northern British provinces along the
Atlantic coast but during the migrations it favors us only with selections
from its repertoire Mr Ernest Thompson says Its usual song is like the
latter half of the whitethroats familiar refrain repeated a number of times
with a peculiar sad cadence and in a clear soft whistle that is
characteristic of the group The song is the loudest and most plaintive of
all the sparrow songs says John Burroughs It begins with the words feu
feu feu and runs off into trills and quavers like the song sparrows only
much more touching Colorado miners tell that this sparrow like its
whitethroated relative sings on the darkest nights Often a score or more
birds are heard singing at once after the habit of the European nightingales
which however choose to sing only in the moonlight


WHITETHROATED SPARROW Zonotrichia albicollis Finch family

Called also PEABODY BIRD CANADA SPARROW

Length  675 to 7 inches Larger than the English sparrow
Male and Female  A black crown divided by narrow white line
 Yellow spot before the eye and a white line apparently
 running through it passes backward to the nape Conspicuous
 white throat Chestnut back varied with black and whitish
 Breast gray growing lighter underneath Wings edged with
 rufous and with two white crossbars
Range  Eastern North America Nests from Michigan and
 Massachusetts northward to Labrador Winters from southern New
 England to Florida
Migrations  April October Abundant during migrations and in
 many States a winter resident

II Peabody Peabody Peabody are the syllables of the whitethroats
song heard by the good New Englanders who have a tradition that you must
either be a Peabody or a nobody there while just over the British border the
bird is distinctly understood to say Sweeeet Canada Canada Cana
da All day whittleing whittleing whittleing the Maine people
declare he sings and Hamilton Gibson told of a perplexed farmer Peverly by
name who as he stood in the field undecided as to what crop to plant
clearly heard the bird advise Sow wheat Peverly Peverly Peverly
Such divergence of opinion which is really slight compared with the verbal
record of many birds songs only goes to show how little the sweetness of
birds music like the perfume of a rose depends upon a name

In a family not distinguished for good looks the whitethroated sparrow is
conspicuously handsome especially after the spring moult In midwinter the
feathers grow dingy and the markings indistinct but as the season advances
his colors are sure to brighten perceptibly and before he takes the northward
journey in April any little lady sparrow might feel proud of the attentions
of so finelooking and sweetvoiced a lover The black white and yellow
markings on his head are now clear and beautiful His figure is plump and
aristocratic

These sparrows are particularly sociable travellers and cordially welcome
many stragglers to their flocks  not during the migrations only but even
when winters snow affords only the barest gleanings above it Then they
boldly peck about the dogs plate by the kitchen door and enter the barnyard
calling their feathered friends with a sharp tseep to follow them Seeds and
insects are their chosen food and were they not well wrapped in an adipose
coat under their feathers there must be many a winter night when they would
go shivering supperless to their perch

In the dark of midnight one may sometimes hear the whitethroat softly singing
in its dreams

Migrations  End of March September or later Summer resident

The stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the
turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their
coming  Jeremiah viii 7

The earliest of the family to appear in the spring the tree swallow comes
skimming over the freshly ploughed fields with a wide sweep of the wings in
what appears to be a perfect ecstasy of flight More shy of the haunts of man
and less gregarious than its cousins it is usually to be seen during
migration flying low over the marshes ponds and streams with a few chosen
friends keeping up an incessant warbling twitter while performing their
bewildering and tireless evolutions as they catch their food on the wing
Their white breasts flash in the sunlight and it is only when they dart near
you and skim close along the surface of the water that you discover their
backs to be not black but rich dark green glossy to iridescence

It is probable that these birds keep near the waterways because their favorite
insects and waxberries are more plentiful in such places but this
peculiarity has led many people to the absurd belief that the tree swallow
buries itself under the mud of ponds in winter in a state of hibernation No
birds breathing apparatus is made to operate under mud

In unsettled districts these swallows nest in hollow trees hence their name
but with that laziness that forms a part of the degeneracy of civilization
they now gladly accept the boxes about mens homes set up for the martins
Thousands of these beautiful birds have been shot on the Long Island marshes
and sold to New York epicures for snipe


RUBYTHROATED HUMMINGBIRD Trochilus colubris Hummingbird

Male  Bright metallic green above wings and tail darkest with
 ruddypurplish reflections and duskywhite tips on outer
 tail quills Throat and breast brilliant metallic  red in one
 light orange flame in another and dusky orange in another

 with white
Range  Eastern North America from northern Canada to the Gulf

Migrations  May October Common summer resident

This smallest most exquisite and unabashed of our bird neighbors cannot be
mistaken for it is the only one of its kin found east of the plains and north
of Florida although about four hundred species native only to the New World
have been named by scientists How does it happen that this little tropical
jewel alone flashes about our Northern gardens Does it never stir the spirit
of adventure and emulation in the glistening breasts of its stayathome
cousins in the tropics by tales of luxuriant tangles of honeysuckle and
clematis on our cottage porches of deepcupped trumpetflowers climbing over
the walls of oldfashioned gardens where larkspur narcissus roses and
phlox that crowd the boxedged beds are more gay and honeyladen than their
little brains can picture Apparently it takes only the wish to be in a place
to transport one of these little fairies either from the honeysuckle trellis
to the canna bed or from Yucatan to the Hudson It is easy to see how to will
and to fly are allied in the minds of the hummingbirds as they are in the
Latin tongue One minute poised in midair apparently motionless before a
flower while draining the nectar from its deep cup  though the humming of
its wings tells that it is suspended there by no magic  the next instant it
has flashed out of sight as if a fairys wand had made it suddenly invisible
Without seeing the hummer it might be and often is mistaken for a bee
improving the shining hour

At evening one often hears of a hummingbird going the rounds of the garden
but at this hour it is usually the sphinxmoth hovering above the flowerbeds
 the one other creature besides the bee for which the bird is ever mistaken
The postures and preferences of this beautiful large moth make the mistake a
very natural one

The rubythroat is strangely fearless and unabashed It will dart among the
vines on the veranda while the entire household are assembled there and add
its hum to that of the conversation in a most delightfully neighborly way
Once a glistening little sprite quite undaunted by the size of an audience
that sat almost breathless enjoying his beauty thrust his bill into one calyx
after another on a long sprig of honeysuckle held in the hand

And yet with all its friendliness  or is it simply fearlessness  the
bird is a desperate duellist and will lunge his deadly blade into the
jewelled breast of an enemy at the slightest provocation and quicker than
thought All the heat of his glowing throat seems to be transferred to his
head while the fight continues sometimes even to the death  a cruel but
marvellously beautiful sight as the glistening birds dart and tumble about
beyond the range of peacemakers

High up in a tree preferably one whose knots and lichencovered excrescences
are calculated to help conceal the nest that so cleverly imitates them the
mother hummingbird saddles her exquisite cradle to a horizontal limb She
lines it with plant down fluffy bits from cattails and the fronds of fern
felting the material into a circle that an elmleaf amply roofs over Outside
lichens or bits of bark blend the nest so harmoniously with its surroundings
that one may look long and thoroughly before discovering it Two
infinitesimal white eggs tax the nest accommodation to its utmost

In the mating season the female may be seen perching  a posture one rarely
catches her gay lover in  preening her dainty but sombre feathers with
ladylike nicety The young birds do a great deal of perching before they gain
the marvellously rapid wingmotions of maturity but they are ready to fly
within three weeks after they are hatched By the time the trumpetvine is in
bloom they dart and sip and utter a shrill little squeak among the flowers in
company with the old birds

During the nestbuilding and incubation the male bird keeps so aggressively on
the defensive that he often betrays to a hitherto unsuspecting intruder the
location of his home After the young birds have to be fed he is most diligent
in collecting food that consists not alone of the sweet juices of flowers as
is popularly supposed but also of aphides and plantlice that his
proboscislike tongue licks off the garden foliage literally like a streak of
lightning

Both parents feed the young by regurgitation  a process disgusting to the
human observer whose stomach involuntarily revolts at the sight so welcome to
the tiny squeaking hungry birds


RUBYCROWNED KINGLET Regulus calendula Kinglet family

Called also RUBYCROWNED WREN RUBYCROWNED WARBLER

Length  425 to 45 inches About two inches smaller than the
 English sparrow
Male  Upper parts grayish olivegreen brighter nearer the
 tail wings and tail dusky edged with yellowish olive Two
 whitish wingbars Breast and underneath light yellowish gray
 In the adult male a vermilion spot on crown of his ashgray
 head
Female  Similar but without the vermilion crest
Range  North America Breeds from northern United States
 northward Winters from southern limits of its breeding range
 to Central America and Mexico
Migrations  October April Rarely a winter resident at the
 North Most common during its migrations

A trifle larger than the goldencrowned kinglet with a vermilion crest
instead of a yellow and flame one and with a decided preference for a warmer
winter climate and the rubycrowns chief distinguishing characteristics are
told These rather confusing relatives would be less puzzling if it were the
habit of either to keep quiet long enough to focus the operaglasses on their
crowns which it only rarely is while some particularly promising haunt of
insects that lurk beneath the rough bark of the evergreens has to be
thoroughly explored At all other times both kinglets keep up an incessant
fluttering and twinkling among the twigs and leaves at the ends of the
branches jerking their tiny bodies from twig to twig in the shrubbery
hanging head downward like a nuthatch and most industriously feeding every
second upon the tiny insects and larvae hidden beneath the bark and leaves
They seem to be the feathered expression of perpetual motion And how dainty
and charming these tiny sprites are They are not at all shy you may approach
them quite close if you will for the birds are simply too intent on their
business to be concerned with yours

If a sharp lookout be kept for these rubycrowned migrants that too often
slip away to the south before we know they have come we notice that they
appear about a fortnight ahead of the goldencrested species since the mild
soft air of our Indian summer is exactly to their liking At this season there
is nothing in the birds thin metallic callnote like a vibrating wire to
indicate that he is one of our finest songsters But listen for him during the
spring migration when a lovesong is already ripening in his tiny throat
What a volume of rich lyrical melody pours from the Norway spruce where the
little musician is simply practising to perfect the richer fuller song that
he sings to his nesting mate in the far north The volume is really
tremendous coming from so tiny a throat Those who have heard it in northern
Canada describe it as a flutelike and mellow warble full of intricate phrases
past the imitating Dr Coues says of it The kinglets exquisite
vocalization defies description

Curiously enough the nest of this bird that is not at all rare has been
discovered only six times It would appear to be over large for the tiny bird
until we remember that kinglets are wont to have a numerous progeny in their
pensile globular home It is made of light flimsy material  moss strips
of bark and plant fibre well knit together and closely lined with feathers
which must be a grateful addition to the babies where they are reared in
evergreens in cold northern woods


GOLDENCROWNED KINGLET Regulus satrapa Kinglet family

Called also GOLDENCROWNED GOLDCREST FIERY CROWNED WREN

Length  4 to 425 inches About two inches smaller than the
 English sparrow
Male  Upper parts grayish olivegreen wings and tail dusky
 margined with olivegreen Underneath soiled whitish Centre of
 crown bright orange bordered by yellow and en closed by black
 line Cheeks gray a whitish line over the eye
Female  Similar but centre of crown lemonyellow and more
 grayish underneath
Range  North America generally Breeds from northern United
 States northward Winters chiefly from North Carolina to
 Central America but many remain north all the year
Migrations  September April Chiefly a winter resident south
 Of Canada

If this cheery little winter neighbor would keep quiet long enough we might
have a glimpse of the golden crest that distinguishes him from his equally
lively cousin the rubycrowned but he is so constantly flitting about the
ends of the twigs peering at the bark for hidden insects twinkling his wings
and fluttering among the evergreens with more nervous restlessness than a
vireo that you may know him well before you have a glimpse of his tricolored
crown

When the autumn foliage is all aglow with yellow and flame this tiny sprite
comes out of the north where neither nesting nor moulting could rob him of his
cheerful spirits Except the hummingbird and the winter wren he is the
smallest bird we have And yet somewhere stored up in his diminutive body is
warmth enough to withstand zero weather With evident enjoyment of the cold
he calls out a shrill wiry zee zee zee that rings merrily from the pines
and spruces when our fingers are too numb to hold the opera glasses in an
attempt to follow his restless fittings from branch to branch Is it one of
the unwritten laws of birds that the smaller their bodies the greater their
activity

When you see one kinglet about you may be sure there are others not far away
for except in the nesting season its habits are distinctly social its
friendliness extending to the humdrum brown creeper the chickadees and the
nuthatches in whose company it is often seen indeed it is likely to be in
almost any flock of the winter birds They are a merry band as they go
exploring the trees together The kinglet can hang upside down too like the
other acrobats many of whose tricks he has learned and it can pick off
insects from a tree with as businesslike an air as the brown creeper but
with none of that soulless birds plodding precision

In the early spring just before this busy little sprite leaves us to nest in
Canada or Labrador  for heat is the one thing that he cant cheerfully
endure  a gushing lyrical song bursts from his tiny throat  a song whose
volume is so out of proportion to the birds size that Nuttalls
classification of kinglets with wrens doesnt seem far wrong after all Only
rarely is a nest found so far south as the White Mountains It is said to be
extraordinarily large for so small a bird but that need not surprise us when
we learn that as many as ten
creamywhite eggs blotched with brown and lavender are no uncommon number
for the pensile cradle to hold How do the tiny parents contrive to cover so
many eggs and to feed such a nestful of fledglings


SOLITARY VIREO Vireo solitarius Vireo or Greenlet family

Called also BLUEHEADED VIREO AOU 1998

Length  55 to 7 inches A little smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Dusky olive above head bluish gray with a white line
 around the eye spreading behind the eye into a patch Beneath
 whitish with yellowgreen wash on the sides Wings dusky
 olive with two distinct white bars Tail dusky some quills
 edged with white
Female  Similar but her head is dusky olive
Range  United States to plains and the southern British
 provinces Winters in Florida and southward
Migrations  May Early October Common during migrations more
 rarely a summer resident south of Massachusetts

By no means the recluse that its name would imply the solitary vireo while a
bird of the woods shows a charming curiosity about the stranger with
operaglasses in hand who has penetrated to the deep swampy tangles where
it chooses to live Peering at you through the green undergrowth with an eye
that seems especially conspicuous because of its encircling white rim it is
at least as sociable and cheerful as any member of its family and Mr
Bradford Torrey credits it with winning tameness Woodbird as it is he
says it will sometimes permit the greatest familiarities Two birds I have
seen which allowed themselves to be stroked in the freest manner while
sitting on the eggs and which ate from my hand as readily as any pet canary

The solitary vireo also builds a pensile nest swung from the crotch of a
branch not so high from the ground as the yellowthroated vireos nor so
exquisitely finished but still a beautiful little structure of pineneedles
plantfibre dry leaves and twigs all lichenlined and bound and rebound
with coarse spiders webs

The distinguishing quality of this vireos celebrated song is its tenderness
a pure serene uplifting of its loving trustful nature that seems inspired by
a fine spirituality


REDEYED VIREO Vireo olivaceus Vireo or Greenlet family

Called also THE PREACHER

Length  575 to 625 inches A fraction smaller than the
 English sparrow
Male and Female  Upper parts light olivegreen welldefined
 slatygray cap with black marginal line below which and
 forming an exaggerated eyebrow is a line of white A brownish
 band runs from base of bill through the eye The iris is
 rubyred Underneath white shaded with light greenish yellow
 on sides and on under tail and wing coverts
Range  United States to Rockies and northward Wnters in
 Central and South America
Migrations  April October Common summer resident

You see it  you know it  do you hear me Do you believe it is Wilson
Flaggs famous interpretation of the song of this commonest of all the vireos
that you cannot mistake with such a key He calls the bird the preacher from
its declamatory style an upanddown warble delivered with a rising
inflection at the close and followed by an impressive silence as if the
little green orator were saying I pause for a reply

Notwithstanding its quiet coloring that so closely resembles the leaves it
hunts among this vireo is rather more noticeable than its relatives because
of its slaty cap and the blackandwhite lines over its ruby eye that in
addition to the song are its marked characteristics

Whether she is excessively stupid or excessively kind the mothervireo has
certainly won for herself no end of ridicule by allowing the cowbird to
deposit a stray egg in the exquisitely made pensile nest where her own tiny
white eggs are lying and though the young cowbird crowd and worry her little
fledglings and eat their dinner as fast as she can bring it in no displeasure
or grudging is shown towards the dusky intruder that is sure to upset the
rightful heirs out of the nest before they are able to fly

In the heat of a midsummer noon when nearly every other birds voice is
hushed and only the locust seems to rejoice in the fierce sunshine the
little redeyed vireo goes persistently about its business of gathering
insects from the leaves not flitting nervously about like a warbler or
taking its food on the wing like a flycatcher but patiently and industriously
dining where it can and singing as it goes

When a worm is caught it is first shaken against a branch to kill it before it
is swallowed Vireos haunt shrubbery and trees with heavy foliage all their
hunting singing resting and homebuilding being done among the leaves 
never on the ground


WHITEEYED VIREO Vireo noveboracensis Vireo or Greenlet family

Male  5 to 53 inches An inch shorter than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Upper parts bright olivegreen washed with
 grayish Throat and underneath white the breast and sides
 greenish yellow wings have two distinct bars of yellowish
 white Yellow line from beak to and around the eye which has a
 white iris Feathers of wings and tail brownish and edged with
 yellow
Range  United States to the Rockies and to the Gulf regions
 And beyond in winter
Migrations  May September Summer resident

Pertest of songsters the whiteeyed vireo makes whatever neighborhood it
enters lively at once Taking up a residence in the tangled shrubbery or
thickety undergrowth it immediately begins to scold like a crotchety old
wren It becomes irritated over the merest trifles  a passing bumblebee a
visit from another bird to its tangle an unsuccessful peck at a gnat
 anything seems calculated to rouse its wrath and set every feather on its
little body atrembling while it sharply snaps out what might perhaps be
freely constructed into cusswords

And yet the inscrutable mystery is that this virago meekly permits the lazy
cowbird to deposit an egg in its nest and will patiently sit upon it though
it is as large as three of her own tiny eggs and when the little interloper
comes out from his shell the motherbird will continue to give it the most
devoted care long after it has shoved her poor little starved babies out of
the nest to meet an untimely death in the smilax thicket below

An unusual variety of expression distinguishes this birds voice from the
songs of the other vireos which are apt to be monotonous as they are
incessant If you are so fortunate to approach the whiteeyed vireo before he
suspects your presence you may hear him amusing himself by jumbling together
snatches of the songs of the other birds in a sort of potpourri or perhaps he
will be scolding or arguing with an imaginary foe then dropping his voice and
talking confidentially to himself Suddenly he bursts into a charming simple
little song as if the introspection had given him reason for real joy All
these vocal accomplishments suggest the chat at once but the minute your
intrusion is discovered the sharp scolding that is fairly screamed at you
from an enraged little throat leaves no possible shadow of a doubt as to the
bird you have disturbed It has the most emphatic call and song to be heard in
the woods it snaps its words off very short Chickarer chick is its usual
callnote jerked out with great spitefulness

Wilson thus describes the jealously guarded nest This bird builds a very
neat little nest often in the figure of an inverted cone it is suspended by
the upper end of the two sides on the circular bend of a prickly vine a
species of smilax that generally grows in low thickets Outwardly it is
constructed of various light materials bits of rotten wood fibres of dry
stalks of weeds pieces of paper commonly newspapers an article almost
always found about its nest so that some of my friends have given it the name
of the politician all these materials are interwoven with the silk of the

WARBLING VIREO Vireo gilvus Vireo or Greenlet family

Length  55 to 6 inches A little smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Ashy olivegreen above with head and neck
 ashcolored Dusky line over the eye Underneath whitish
 faintly washed with dull yellow deepest on sides no bars on
 wings
Range  North America from Hudson Bay to Mexico
Migrations  May Late September or early October Summer
 resident

This musical little bird shows a curious preference for rows of trees in the
village street or by the roadside where he can be sure of an audience to
listen to his rich continuous warble There is a mellowness about his voice
which rises loud but not altogether cheerfully above the bird chorus as if
he were a gifted but slightly disgruntled contralto Too inconspicuously
dressed and usually too high in the treetop to be identified without
operaglasses we may easily mistake him by his voice for one of the warbler
family which is very closely allied to the vireos Indeed this warbling
vireo seems to be the connecting link between them

Morning and afternoon but almost never in the evening we may hear him
rippling out song after song as he feeds on insects and berries about the
garden But this familiarity lasts only until nesting time for off he goes
with his little mate to some unfrequented lane near a wood until their family
is reared when with a perceptibly happier strain in his voice he once more
haunts our garden and row of elms before taking the southern journey


OVENBIRD Seiurus aurocapillus Wood Warbler family

Called also GOLDENCROWNED THRUSH THE TEACHER WOOD WAGTAIL
 GOLDENCROWNED WAGTAIL GOLDENCROWNED ACCENTOR

 bordered by black lines that converge toward the bill Under
 parts white breast spotted and streaked on the sides White
 eyering

Early in May you may have the good fortune to see this little bird of the
woods strutting in and out of the garden shrubbery with a certain mock
dignity like a child wearing its fathers boots Few birds can walk without
appearing more or less ridiculous and however gracefully and prettily it
steps this amusing little wagtail is no exception When seen at all  which
is not often for it is shy  it is usually on the ground not far from the
shrubbery or a woodland thicket under which it will quickly dodge out of
sight at the merest suspicion of a footstep To most people the bird is only a
voice calling TEACHER TEACHER TEACHER TEACHER TEACHER as Mr Burroughs
has interpreted the notes that go off in pairs like a series of little
explosions softly at first then louder and louder and more shrill until the
bird that you at first thought far away seems to be shrieking his penetrating
crescendo into your very ears But you may look until you are tired before you
find him in the high dry wood never near water

In the driest parts of the wood here the ground is thickly carpeted with dead
leaves you may some day notice a little bunch of them that look as if a
plant in pushing its way up through the ground had raised the leaves
rootlets and twigs a trifle

Examine the spot more carefully and on one side you find an opening and
within the ball of earth softly lined with grass lie four or five
creamwhite speckled eggs It is only by a happy accident that this nest of
the ovenbird is discovered The concealment could not be better It is this
peculiarity of nest construction  in shape like a Dutch oven  that has
given the bird what DeKay considers its trivial name Not far from the nest
the parent birds scratch about in the leaves like diminutive barnyard fowls
for the grubs and insects hiding under them But at the first suspicion of an
intruder their alarm becomes pitiful Panicstricken they become fairly limp
with fear and drooping her wings and tail the motherbird drags herself
hither and thither over the ground

As utterly bewildered as his mate the male darts flies and tumbles about
through the low branches jerking and wagging his tail in nervous spasms until
you have beaten a doublequick retreat

In nesting time at evening a very few have heard the luxurious nuptial
song of the ovenbird but it is a song to haunt the memory forever afterward
Burroughs appears to be the first writer to record this rare bit of bird
melody Mounting by easy flight to the top of the tallest tree says the
author of WakeRobin the ovenbird launches into the air with a sort of
suspended hovering flight like certain of the finches and bursts into a
perfect ecstasy of song  clear ringing copious rivalling the goldfinchs
in vivacity and the linnets in melody


WORMEATING WARBLER Helmintherus vermivorus Wood Warbler family

Length  550 inches Less than an inch shorter than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Greenish olive above Head yellowish brown
 With two black stripes through crown to the nape also black
 Lines from the eyes to neck Under parts buffy and white
Range  Eastern parts of United States Nests as far north as
 southern Illinois and southern Connecticut Winters in the Gulf
 States and southward
Migrations  May September Summer resident

In the Delaware Valley and along the same parallel this inconspicuous warbler
is abundant but north of New Jersey it is rare enough to give an excitement
to the day on which you discover it No doubt it is commoner than we suppose
for its coloring blends so admirably with its habitats that it is probably
very often overlooked Its callnote a common chirp has nothing
distinguishing about it and all ornithologists confess to having been often
misled by its song into thinking it came from the chipping sparrow It closely
resembles that of the pine warbler also If it were as nervously active as
most warblers we should more often discover it but it is quite as deliberate
as a vireo and in the painstaking way in which it often circles around a tree
while searching for spiders and other insects that infest the trunks it
reminds us of the brown creeper Sunny slopes and hillsides covered with thick
undergrowth are its preferred foraging and nesting haunts It is often seen
hopping directly on the dry ground where it places its nest and it never
mounts far above it The welldrained sunny situation for the home is chosen
with the wisdom of a sanitary expert


ACADIAN FLYCATCHER Empidonax virescens Flycatcher family

Called also SMALL GREENCRESTED FLYCATCHER SMALL PEWEE

Length  575 to 6 inches A trifle smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Dull olive above Two conspicuous yellowish wingbars
 Throat white shading into pale yellow on breast Light gray
 or white underneath Upper part of bill black lower mandible
 fleshcolor White eyering
Female  Greener above and more yellow below
Range  From Canada to Mexico Central America and West Indies
 Most common in south temperate latitudes Winters in southerly
 limit of range
Migrations  April September Summer resident

When all our northern landscape takes on the exquisite soft green gray and
yellow tints of early spring this little flycatcher in perfect colorharmony
with the woods it darts among comes out of the south It might be a leaf that
is being blown about touched by the sunshine filtering through the trees and
partly shaded by the young foliage casting its first shadows

Woodlands through which small streams meander lazily inviting swarms of
insects to their boggy shores make ideal hunting grounds for the Acadian
flycatcher It chooses a low rather than a high conspicuous perch that other
members of its family invariably select and from such a lookout it may be
seen launching into the air after the passing gnat  darting downward then
suddenly mounting upward in its aerial hunt the vigorous clicks of the beak
as it closes over its tiny victims testifying to the birds unerring aim and
its hearty appetite

While perching a constant tailtwitching is kept up and a faint fretful
Tsheekee tsheekee escapes the bird when inactively waiting for a dinner
to heave in sight

In the Middle Atlantic States its peeping sound and the clicking of its
particolored bill are infrequently heard in the village streets in the autumn
when the shy and solitary birds are enticed from the deep woods by a prospect
of a more plentiful diet of insects attracted by the fruit in orchards and
gardens

Never far from the ground on two or more parallel branches the shallow
unsubstantial nest is laid Some one has cleverly described it as a tuft of
hay caught by the limb from a load driven under it but this description
omits all mention of the quantities of blossoms that must be gathered to line
the cradle for the tiny cream white eggs spotted with brown


YELLOWBELLIED FLYCATCHER Empidonax flaviventris Flycatcher
 family

Length  5 to 56 inches About an inch smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male  Rather dark but true olivegreen above Throat and
 breast yellowish olive shading into pale yellow underneath
 including wing linings and under tail coverts Wings have
 yellowish bars Whitish ring around eye Upper part of bill
 black under part whitish or fleshcolored
Female  Smaller with brighter yellow under parts and more
 decidedly yellow wingbars
Range  North America from Labrador to Panama and westward
 from the Atlantic to the plains Winters in Central America
Migrations  May September Summer resident More commonly a
 migrant only

This is the most yellow of the small flycatchers and the only Eastern species
with a yellow instead of a white throat Without hearing its callnote
pseekpseek which it abruptly sneezes rather than utters it is quite
impossible as it darts among the trees to tell it from the Acadian
flycatcher with which even Audubon confounded it Both these little birds
choose the same sort of retreats  welltimbered woods near a stream that
attracts myriads of insects to its spongy shores  and both are rather shy
and solitary The yellowbellied species has a far more northerly range
however than its Southern relative or even the small greencrested
flycatcher It is rare in the Middle States not common even in New England
except in the migrations but from the Canada border northward its soft
plaintive whistle which is its lovesong may be heard in every forest where
it nests All the flycatchers seem to make a noise with so much struggle such
convulsive jerkings of head and tail and flutterings of the wings that
considering the scanty success of their musical attempts it is surprising
they try to lift their voices at all when the effort almost literally lifts
them off their feet

While this little flycatcher is no less erratic than its Acadian cousin its
nest is never slovenly One couple had their home in a wildgrape bower in
Pennsylvania a Virginia creeper in New Jersey supported another cradle that
was fully twenty feet above the ground but in Labrador where the bird has
its chosen breeding grounds the bulky nest is said to be invariably placed
either in the moss by the brookside or in some old stump should the locality
be too swampy

There can be little difficulty in naming a bird so brilliantly and distinctly
marked as this green gold and black warbler that lifts up a few pure
sweet tender notes loud enough to attract attention when he visits the
garden Seesee seesaw he sings but there is a tone of anxiety betrayed
in the simple sylvan strain that always seems as if the bird needed
reassuring possibly due to the rising inflection like an interrogative of
the last notes

However abundant about our homes during the migrations this warbler true to
the family instinct retreats to the woods to nest  not always so far away
as Canada the nesting ground of most warblers for in many Northern States
the bird is commonly found throughout the summer Doubtless it prefers tall
evergreen trees for its mossy grassy nest but it is not always particular
so that the tree be a tall one with a convenient fork in an upper branch

Early in September increased numbers emerge from the woods the plumage of the
male being less brilliant than when we saw it last as if the family cares of
the summer had proved too taxing For nearly a month longer they hunt
incessantly with much flitting about the leaves and twigs at the ends of
branches in the shrubbery and evergreens for the tiny insects that the
warblers must devour by the million during their all too brief visit

This is undoubtedly the beauty of the vireo family  a group of neat active
stoutly built and vigorous little birds of yellow greenish and white
plumage birds that love the trees and whose feathers reflect the coloring of
the leaves they hide hunt and nest among We have no birds says Bradford
Torrey so unsparing of their music they sing from morning till night

The yellowthroated vireo partakes of all the family characteristics but in
addition to these it eclipses all its relatives in the brilliancy of its
coloring and in the art of nestbuilding which it has brought to a state of
hopeless perfection No envious bird need try to excel the exquisite finish of
its workmanship Happily it has wit enough to build its pensile nest high
above the reach of small boys usually suspending it from a branch overhanging
running water that threatens too precipitous a bath to tempt the young
climbers

However common in the city parks and suburban gardens this bird may be during
the migrations it delights in a secluded retreat overgrown with tall trees
and near a stream such as is dear to the solitary vireo as well when the
nesting time approaches High up in the trees we hear its rather sad
persistent strain that is more in harmony with the dim forest than with the
gay flower garden where if the truth must be told its song is both
monotonous and depressing Mr Bicknell says it is the only vireo that sings
as it flies


AMERICAN GOLDFINCH Spinus tristis Finch family

 Seen throughout the winter as well

An old field overgrown with thistles and tall stalky wild flowers is the
paradise of the goldfinches summer or winter Here they congregate in happy
companies while the sunshine and goldenrod are as bright as their feathers
and cling to the swaying slender stems that furnish an abundant harvest
daintily lunching upon the fluffy seeds of thistle blossoms pecking at the
mulleinstalks and swinging airily among the asters and Michaelmas daisies
or when snow covers the same field with a glistening crust above which the
brown stalks offer only a meagre dinner the same birds now sombrely clad in
winter feathers cling to the swaying stems with cheerful fortitude

At your approach the busy company rises on the wing and with peculiar wavy
flight rise and fall through the air marking each undulation with a cluster
of notes sweet and clear that come floating downward from the blue ether
where the birds seem to bound along exultant in their motion and song alike

In the spring the plumage of the goldfinch which has been drab and brown
through the winter months is moulted or shed  a change that transforms the
bird from a sombre Puritan into the gayest of cavaliers and seems to
wonderfully exalt his spirits He bursts into a wild sweet incoherent melody
that might be the outpouring from two or three throats at once instead of one
expressing his rapture somewhat after the manner of the canary although his
song lacks the variety and the finish of his caged namesake What tone of
sadness in his music the man found who applied the adjective tristis to his
scientific name it is difficult to imagine when listening to the notes that
come bubbling up from the birds happy heart

With plumage so lovely and song so delicious and dreamy it is small wonder
that numbers of our goldfinches are caught and caged however inferior their
song may be to the European species recently introduced into this country
Heard in Central Park New York where they were set at liberty the European
goldfinches seemed to sing with more abandon perhaps but with no more
sweetness than their American cousins The song remains at its best all
through the summer months for the bird is a long wooer It is nearly July
before he mates and not until the tardy cedar birds are housebuilding in the
orchard do the happy pair begin to carry grass moss and plantdown to a
crotch of some tall tree convenient to a field of such wild flowers as will
furnish food to a growing family Doubtless the birds wait for this food to be
in proper condition before they undertake parental duties at all
 the most plausible excuse for their late nesting The cares evolving from
four to six paleblue eggs will suffice to quiet the fathers song for the
winter by the first of September and fade all the glory out of his shining
coat As pretty a sight as any garden offers is when a family of goldfinches
alights on the top of a sunflower to feast upon the oily seeds  a perfect
harmony of brown and gold


EVENING GROSBEAK Coccothraustes vespertinus Finch family

Length  8 inches Two inches shorter than the robin
Male  Forehead shoulders and underneath clear yellow dull
 yellow on lower back sides of the head throat and breast
 olivebrown Crown tail and wings black the latter with
 white secondary feathers Bill heavy and blunt and yellow
Female  Brownish gray more less suffused with yellow Wings
 and tail blackish with some white feathers
Range  Interior of North America Resident from Manitoba
 northward Common winter visitor in northwestern United States
 and Mississippi Valley casual winter visitor in northern
 Atlantic States

In the winter of 188990 Eastern people had the rare treat of becoming
acquainted with this common bird of the Northwest that in one of its erratic
travels chose to visit New England and the Atlantic States as far south as
Delaware in great numbers Those who saw the evening grosbeaks then remember
how beautiful their yellow plumage  a rare winter tint  looked in the
snowcovered trees where small companies of the gentle and ever tame visitors
enjoyed the buds and seeds of the maples elders and evergreens Possibly
evening grosbeaks were in vogue for the next seasons millinery or perhaps
Eastern ornithologists had a sudden zeal to investigate their structural
anatomy At any rate these birds whose very tameness that showed slight
acquaintance with mankind should have touched the coldest heart received the
warmest kind of a reception from hot shot The few birds that escaped to the
solitudes of Manitoba could not be expected to tempt other travellers eastward
by an account of their visit The bird is quite likely to remain rare in the
East

But in the Mississippi Valley and throughout the northwest companies of from
six to sixty may be regularly counted upon as winter neighbors on almost every
farm Here the females keep up a busy chatting like a company of cedar birds
and the males punctuate their pauses with a single shrill note that gives
little indication of their vocal powers But in the solitude of the northern
forests the lovesong is said to resemble the robins at the start Unhappily
after a most promising beginning the bird suddenly stops as if he were out
of breath


BLUEWINGED WARBLER Helminthophila pinus Wood Warbler family

In the naming of warblers bluish slate is the shade intended when blue is
mentioned so that if you see a dainty little olive and yellow bird with
slatecolored wings and tail hunting for spiders in the blossoming orchard or
during the early autumn you will have seen the beautiful bluewinged warbler
It has a rather leisurely way of hunting unlike the nervous restless
flitting about from twig to twig that is characteristic of many of its many
cousins The search is thorough  bark stems blossoms leaves are inspected
for larvae and spiders with many pretty motions of head and body Sometimes
hanging with head downward the bird suggests a yellow titmouse After blossom
time a pair of these warblers that have done serviceable work in the orchard
in their all too brief stay hurry off to dense woods to nest They are
usually to be seen in pairs at all seasons Not to high coniferous trees in
northern forests  the Mecca of innumerable warblers  but to scrubby
second growth of woodland borders or lower trees in the heart of the woods
do these dainty birds retreat There they build the usual warbler nest of
twigs bits of bark leaves and grasses but with this peculiarity the
numerous leaves with which the nest is wrapped all have their stems pointing
upward Mr Frank Chapman has admirably defined their song as consisting of
two drawled wheezy notes  sweechee the first inhaled the second
exhaled


CANADIAN WARBLER Sylvania canadensis Wood Warbler family

Called also CANADIAN FLYCATCHER SPOTTED CANADIAN WARBLER
 CANADA WARBLER AOU 1998

Male  Immaculate bluish ash above without marks on wings or
 tail crown spotted with arrowshaped black marks Cheeks line
 from bill to eye and underneath clear yellow Black streaks
 forming a necklace across the breast
Female  Paler with necklace indistinct
Range  North America from Manitoba and Labrador to tropics
Migrations  May September Summer resident most abundant in
 migrations

Since about onethird of all the songbirds met with in a years rambles are
apt to be warblers the novice cannot devote his first attention to a better
group confusing though it is by reason of its size and the repetition of the
same colors in so many bewildering combinations Monotony however is unknown
in the warbler family Whoever can rightly name every warbler male and
female on sight is uniquely accomplished

The jet necklace worn on this birds breast is its best mark of
identification Its form is particularly slender and graceful as might be
expected in a bird so active one to whom a hundred tiny insects barely afford
a dinner that must often be caught piecemeal as it flies past To satisfy its
appetite which cannot but be dainty in so thoroughly charming a bird it
lives in low boggy woods in such retreats as Wilsons blackcapped warbler
selects for a like reason Neither of these two flycatcher warblers depends
altogether on catching insects on the wing countless thousands are picked off
the under sides of leaves and about the stems of twigs in true warbler
fashion

The Canadians song is particularly loud sweet and vivacious It is
hazardous for any one without long field practice to try to name any warbler
by its song alone but possibly this ones animated music is as characteristic
as any

The nest is built on the ground on a mossy bank or elevated into the root
crannies of some large tree where there is much water in the woods Bits of
bark dead wood moss and fine rootlets all carefully wrapped with leaves
go to make the pretty cradle Unhappily the little Canada warblers are often
cheated out of their natural rights like so many other delightful songbirds
by the greedy interloper that the cowbird deposits in their nest


HOODED WARBLER Sylvania mitrata Wood Warbler family

Length  5 to 575 inches About an inch shorter than the
 English sparrow
Male  Head neck chin and throat black like a hood in mature
 male specimens only Hood restricted or altogether wanting in
 female and young Upper parts rich olive Forehead cheeks and
 underneath yellow Some conspicuous white on tail feathers
Female  Duller and with restricted cowl
Range  United States east of Rockies and from southern
 Michigan and southern New England to West Indies and tropical
 America where it winters Very local
Migrations  May September Summer resident

This beautifully marked sprightly little warbler might be mistaken in his
immaturity for the yellowthroat and as it is said to take him nearly three
years to grow his hood with the completed cowl and cape there is surely
sufficient reason here for the despair that often seizes the novice in
attempting to distinguish the perplexing warblers Like its Southern
counterpart the hooded warbler prefers wet woods and low trees rather than
high ones for much of its food consists of insects attracted by the dampness
and many of them must be taken on the wing Because of its tireless activity
the birds figure is particularly slender and graceful  a trait too to
which we owe all the glimpses of it we are likely to get throughout the
summer It has a curious habit of spreading its tail as if it wished you to
take special notice of the white spots that adorn it not flirting it as the
redstart does his more gorgeous one but simply opening it like a fan as it
flies and darts about

Its song which is particularly sweet and graceful and with more variation
than most warblers music has been translated Cheweeotsip tsip
cheweeo again interpreted by Mr Chapman as You must come to the woods
or you wont see me


KENTUCKY WARBLER Geothlypis formosa Wood Warbler family

Female  Similar but paler and with grayish instead of black
 markings
Range  United States eastward from the Rockies and from Iowa

Migrations  May September Summer resident

No bird is common at the extreme limits of its range and so this warbler has
a reputation for rarity among the New England ornithologists that would
surprise people in the middle South and Southwest After all that may be said
in the books a bird is either common or rare to the individual who may or may
not have happened to become acquainted with it in any part of its chosen
territory Plenty of people in Kentucky where we might judge from its name
this bird is supposed to be most numerous have never seen or heard of it
while a student on the Hudson River within sight of New York knows it
intimately It also nests regularly in certain parts of the Connecticut
Valley Who is my neighbor is often a question difficult indeed to answer
where birds are concerned In the chapter Spring at the Capital which
with every reading of Wake Robin inspires the birdlover with fresh zeal
Mr Burroughs writes of the Kentucky warbler I meet with him in low damp
places in the woods usually on the steep sides of some little run I hear at
intervals a clear strong belllike whistle or warble and presently catch a
glimpse of the bird as he jumps up from the ground to take an insect or worm
from the under side of a leaf This is his characteristic movement He belongs
to the class of ground warblers and his range is very low indeed lower than
that of any other species with which I am acquainted

Like the ovenbird and comparatively few others for most birds hop over the
ground the Kentucky warbler walks rapidly about looking for insects under
the fallen leaves and poking his inquisitive beak into every cranny where a
spider may be lurking The bird has a pretty conscious way of flying up to a
perch a few feet above the ground as a tenor might advance towards the
footlights of a stage to pour forth his clear penetrating whistle that in
the nesting season especially is repeated over and over again with tireless
persistency


MAGNOLIA WARBLER Dendroica maculosa Wood Warbler family

 in Central America and Cuba
Migrations  May October Spring and summer migrant

In spite of the birds name one need not look for it in the glossy magnolia
trees of the southern gardens more than in the shrubbery on New England lawns
and during the migrations it is quite as likely to be found in one place as in
the other Its true preference however is for the spruces and hemlocks of
its nesting ground in the northern forests For these it deserts us after a
brief hunt about the tender young spring foliage and blossoms where the
early worm lies concealed and before we have become so well acquainted with
its handsome clothes that we will instantly recognize it in the duller ones it
wears on its return trip in the autumn The position of the white marks on the
tail feathers of this warbler however is the clue by which it may be
identified at any season or any stage of its growth If the white bar runs
across the middle of the warblers tail you can be sure of the identity of
the bird A nervous and restless hunter it nevertheless seems less shy than
many of its kin Another pleasing characteristic is that it brings back with
it in October the loud clear rapid whistle with which it has entertained its
nesting mate in the Canada woods through the summer


MOURNING WARBLER Geothlypis philadelphia Wood Warbler family

Migrations  May September Spring and autumn migrant

Since Audubon met with but one of these birds in his incessant trampings and
Wilson secured only an immature imperfectly marked specimen for his
collection the novice may feel no disappointment if he fails to make the
acquaintance of this gay and agreeable widow And yet the shy and wary bird
is not unknown in Central Park New York City Even where its clear whistled
song strikes the ear with a startling novelty that invites to instant pursuit
of the singer you may look long and diligently through the undergrowth
without finding it Dr Merriam says the whistle resembles the syllables
true true true tru too the voice rising on the first three syllables and
falling on the last two In the nesting season this song is repeated over and
over again with a persistency worthy of a Kentucky warbler It is delivered
from a perch within a few feet of the ground as high as the bird seems ever
inclined to ascend


NASHVILLE WARBLER Helminthophila ruficapilla Wood Warbler
 family

Range  North America westward to the plains north to the Fur
 Countries and south to Central America and Mexico Nests north
 of Illinois and northern New England winters in tropics
Migrations  April September or October

It must not be thought that this beautiful warbler confines itself to
backyards in the city of Nashville simply because Wilson discovered it near
there and gave it a local name for the birds actual range reaches from the
fur traders camp near Hudson Bay to the adobe villages of Mexico and Central
America and over two thousand miles east and west in the United States It
chooses open rather than dense woods and treebordered fields It seems to
have a liking for hemlocks and pine trees especially if near a stream that
attracts insects to its shores and Dr Warren notes that in Pennsylvania he
finds small flocks of these warblers in the autumn migration feeding in the
willowy trees near little rivers and ponds Only in the northern parts of the
United States is their nest ever found for the northern British provinces are
their preferred nesting ground One seen in the White Mountains was built on a
mossy rocky edge directly on the ground at the foot of a pine tree and made
of rootlets moss needles from the trees overhead and several layers of
leaves outside with a lining of fine grasses that cradled four white
speckled eggs

The pine warbler closely presses the myrtle warbler for the first place in the
ranks of the family migrants but as the latter bird often stays north all
winter it is usually given the palm Here is a warbler let it be recorded
that is fittingly named for it is a denizen of pine woods only most common
in the long stretches of pine forests at the south and in New York and New
England and correspondingly uncommon wherever the woodsmans axe has laid the
pine trees low throughout its range Its simple sweet and drowsy song
writes Mr Parkhurst is always associated with the smell of pines on a
sultry day It recalls that of the junco and the social sparrow or chippy

Creeping over the bark of trees and peering into every crevice like a
nuthatch running along the limbs not often hopping nervously or flitting
like the warblers darting into the air for a passing insect or descending to
the ground to feed on seeds and berries the pine warbler has by a curious
combination the movements that seem to characterize several different birds

It is one of the largest and hardiest members of its family but not
remarkable for its beauty It is a sociable traveller cheerfully escorting
other warblers northward and welcoming to its band both the yellow redpolls
and the myrtle warblers These birds are very often seen together in the pine
and other evergreen trees in our lawns and in the large city parks


PRAIRIE WARBLER Dendroica discolor Wood Warbler family

Length  475 to 5 inches About an inch and a half shorter than
 the English sparrow
Male  Olivegreen above shading to yellowish on the head and
 with brickred spots on back between the shoulders A yellow
 line over the eye wingbars and all under parts bright yellow
 heavily streaked with black on the sides Line through the eye
 and crescent below it black Much white in outer tail
 feathers
Female  Paler upper parts more grayish olive and markings
 Less distinct than males
Range  Eastern half of the United States Nests as far north as
 New England and Michigan Winters from Florida southward
Migrations  May September Summer resident

Doubtless this diminutive bird was given its name because it prefers open
country rather than the woods  the scrubby undergrowth of oaks young
evergreens and bushes that border clearings being as good a place as any to
look for it and not the windswept treeless tracts of the wild West Its
range is southerly The Southern and Middle States are where it is most
abundant Here is a wood warbler that is not a bird of the woods  less so
in fact than either the summer yellowbird yellow warbler or the palm
warbler that are eminently neighborly and fond of pasture lands and roadside
thickets But the prairie warblers are rather more retiring little sprites
than their cousins and it is not often we get a close enough view of them to
note the brickred spots on their backs which are their distinguishing marks
They have a most unkind preference for briery bushes that discourage human
intimacy In such forbidding retreats they build their nest of plantfibre
rootlets and twigs lined with plantdown and hair

The song of an individual prairie warbler makes only a slight impression It
consists of a series of six or seven quickly repeated tees the next to the
last one being the highest Chapman But the united voices of a dozen or
more of these pretty little birds that often sing together afford something
approaching a musical treat


WILSONS WARBLER Sylvania pusila Wood Warbler family

Called also BLACKCAP GREEN BLACKCAPPED WARBLER WILSONS
 FLYCATCHER

Length  475 to 5 inches About an inch and a half shorter than
 the English sparrow
Male  Black cap yellow forehead all other upper parts
 olivegreen rich yellow underneath
Female  Lacks the black cap
Range  North America from Alaska and Nova Scotia to Panama
 Winters south of Gulf States Nests chiefly north of the United
 States
Migrations  May September Spring and autumn migrant

To see this strikingly marked little bird one must be on the sharp lookout for
it during the latter half of May or at the season of apple bloom and the
early part of September It passes northward with an almost scornful rapidity
Audubon mentions having seen it in Maine at the end of October but this
specimen surely must have been an exceptional laggard

In common with several others of its family it is exceedingly expert in
catching insects on the wing but it may be known as no true flycatcher from
the conspicuous rich yellow of its under parts and also from its habit of
returning from a midair sally to a different perch from the one it left to
pursue its dinner A true flycatcher usually returns to its old perch after
each hunt

To indulge in this aerial chase with success these warblers select for their
home and hunting ground some low woodland growth where a sluggish stream
attracts myriads of insects to the boggy neighborhood Here they build their
nest in low bushes or upon the ground Four or five grayish eggs sprinkled
with cinnamoncolored spots in a circle around the larger end are laid in the
grassy cradle in June Mr H D Minot found one of these nests on Pikes Peak
at an altitude of 11000 feet almost at the limit of vegetation The same
authority compares the birds song to that of the redstart and the yellow
warbler


YELLOW REDPOLL WARBLER Dendroica palmarum hypochrysea Wood
 Warbler family

Called also YELLOW PALM WARBLER the two former palm warbler
 species combined as PALM WARBLER AOU 1998

Length  55 to 575 inches A little smaller than the English
 sparrow
Male and Female  Chestnut crown Upper parts brownish olive
 greenest on lower back Underneath uniform bright yellow
 streaked with chestnut on throat breast and sides Yellow
 line over and around the eye Wings unmarked Tail edged with
 olivegreen a few white spots near tips of outer quills More
 brownish above in autumn and with a grayish wash over the
 yellow under parts
Range  Eastern parts of North America Nests from Nova Scotia
 northward Winters in the Gulf States
Migrations  April October Spring and autumn migrant

While the uniform yellow of this warblers under parts in any plumage is its
distinguishing mark it also has a flycatchers trait of constantly flirting
its tail that is at once an outlet for its superabundant vivacity and a
fairly reliable aid to identification The tail is jerked wagged and flirted
like a baton in the hands of an inexperienced leader of an orchestra One need
not go to the woods to look for the restless little sprite that comes
northward when the early April foliage is as yellow and green as its feathers
It prefers the fields and roadsides and before there are leaves enough on the
undergrowth to conceal it we may come to know it as well as it is possible to
know any bird whose home life is passed so far away Usually it is the first
warbler one sees in the spring in New York and New England With all the
alertness of a flycatcher it will dart into the air after insects that fly
near the ground keeping up a constant chip chip fine and shrill at one end
of the small body and the liveliest sort of tail motions at the other The
pine warbler often bears it company

With the first suspicion of warm weather off goes this hardy little fellow
that apparently loves the cold almost well enough to stay north all the year
like its cousin the myrtle warbler It builds a particularly deep nest of
the usual warbler construction on the ground but its eggs are rosy rather
than the bluish white of others

In the Southern States the bird becomes particularly neighborly and is said
to enter the streets and gardens of towns with a chippys familiarity

Palm Warbler or Redpoll Warbler Dendroica palmarum differs from the
preceding chiefly in its slightly smaller size the more grayishbrown tint in
its olive upper parts and the uneven shade of yellow underneath that varies
from clear yellow to soiled whitish It is the Western counterpart of the
yellow redpoll and is most common in the Mississippi Valley Strangely
enough however it is this warbler and not hypochrysea that goes out of its
way to winter in Florida where it is abundant all winter


YELLOW WARBLER Dendroica aestiva Wood Warbler family

Called also SUMMER YELLOWBIRD GOLDEN WARBLER YELLOW POLL

Length  475 to 52 inches Over an inch shorter than the
 English sparrow
Male  Upper parts oliveyellow brightest on the crown under
 parts bright yellow streaked with reddish brown Wings and
 tail dusky olivebrown edged with yellow
Female  Similar but reddishbrown streakings less distinct
Range  North America except Southwestern States where the
 prothonotary warbler reigns in its stead Nests from Gulf
 States to Fur Countries Winters south of the Gulf States As
 far as northern parts of South America
Migrations  May September Common summer resident

This exquisite little creature of perpetual summer though to find it it must
travel back and forth between two continents comes out of the south with the
golden days of spring From much living in the sunshine through countless
generations its feathers have finally become the color of sunshine itself
and in disposition as well it is nothing if not sunny and bright Not the
least of its attractions is that it is exceedingly common everywhere in the
shrubbery of our lawns in gardens and orchards by the road and brookside in
the edges of woods  everywhere we catch its glint of brightness through the
long summer days and hear its simple sweet and happy song until the end of
July

Because both birds are so conspicuously yellow no doubt this warbler is quite
generally confused with the goldfinch but their distinctions are clear enough
to any but the most superficial glance In the first place the yellow warbler
is a smaller bird than the goldfinch it has neither black crown wings nor
tail and it does have reddishbrown streaks on its breast that are
sufficiently obsolete to make the coloring of that part look simply dull at a
little distance The goldfinchs bill is heavy in order that it may crack
seeds whereas the yellow warblers is slender to enable it to pick minute
insects from the foliage The goldfinchs wavy curved flight is unique and
that of his double differs not a whit from that of all nervous flitting
warblers Surely no one familiar with the rich full canarylike song of the
wild canary as the goldfinch is called could confuse it with the mild
Weechee chee cherwee of the summer yellowbird Another distinction not
always infallible but nearly so is that when seen feeding the goldfinch is
generally below the line of vision while the yellow warbler is either on it
or not far above it as it rarely goes over twelve feet from the ground

No doubt the particularly mild sweet amiability of the yellow warbler is
responsible for the persistent visitations of the cowbird from which it is a
conspicuous sufferer In the exquisite neat little matted cradle of
glistening milkweed flax lined with down from the fronds of fern the
skulking housebreaker deposits her surreptitious egg for the little yellow
motherbird to hatch and tend But amiability is not the only prominent trait
in the female yellow warblers character She is clever as well and quickly
builds a new bottom on her nest thus sealing up the cowbirds egg and
depositing her own on the soft spongy floor above it This operation has been
known to be twice repeated until the nest became three stories high when a
persistent cowbird made such unusual architecture necessary

The most common nesting place of the yellow warbler is in low willows along
the shores of streams


YELLOWBREASTED CHAT Icteria virens Wood Warbler family

Called also POLYGLOT CHAT YELLOW MOCKING BIRD

Length  75 inches A trifle over an inch longer than the
 English sparrow
Male and Female  Uniform olivegreen above Throat breast and
 under side of wings bright clear yellow Underneath white
 Sides grayish White line over the eye reaching to base of
 bill and forming partial eyering Also white line on sides of
 throat Bill and feet black
Range  North America from Ontario to Central America and
 westward to the plains Most common in Middle Atlantic States
Migrations  Early May Late August or September Summer
 resident

This largest of the warblers might be mistaken for a dozen birds collectively
in as many minutes but when it is known that the jumble of whistles parts of
songs chuckles clucks barks quacks whines and wails proceed from a
single throat the yellowbreasted chat becomes a marked specimen forthwith 
a conspicuous individual never to be confused with any other member of the
feathered tribe It is indeed absolutely unique The catbird and the
mockingbird are rare mimics but while the chat is not their equal in this
respect it has a large repertoire of weird uncanny cries all its own  a
power of throwing its voice like a human ventriloquist into unexpected
corners of the thicket or meadow In addition to its extraordinary vocal
feats it can turn somersaults and do other clownlike stunts as well as any
variety actor on the Bowery stage

Only by creeping cautiously towards the roadside tangle where this
rollicking polyglot is entertaining himself and his mate brooding over her
speckled eggs in a bulky nest set in a most inaccessible briery part of the
thicket can you hope to hear him rattle through his variety performance Walk
boldly or noisily past his retreat and there is silence there and nothing
more But two very bright eyes peer out at you through the undergrowth where
the trim elegantlooking bird watches you with quizzical suspicion until you
quietly seat yourself assume silent indifference Whew whew he begins and
then immediately with evident intent to amuse he rattles off an
indescribable eccentric medley until your ears are tired listening With bill
uplifted tail drooping wings fluttering at his side he cuts an absurd
figure enough but not so comical as when he rises into the air trailing his
legs behind him storkfashion This surely is the clown among birds But any
though he is he is as capable of devotion to his Columbine as Punchinello
and remains faithfully mated year after year However much of a tease and a
deceiver he may be to the passerby along the roadside in the privacy of the
domestic circle he shows truly lovable traits

He has the habit of singing in his unmusical way on moonlight nights Probably
his ventriloquial powers are cultivated not for popular entertainment but to
lure intruders away from his nest


MARYLAND YELLOWTHROAT Geothlypis trichas Wood Warbler family

Called also BLACKMASKED GROUND WARBLER COMMON YELLOWTHROAT
 AOU 1998

Length  533 inches Just an inch shorter than the typical
 English sparrow
Male  Olivegray on head shading to olivegreen on all the
 other upper parts Forehead cheeks and sides of head black
 like a mask and bordered behind by a grayish line Throat and
 breast bright yellow growing steadily paler underneath
Female  Either totally lacks black mask or its place is
 Indicated by only a dusky tint She is smaller and duller
Range  Eastern North America west to the plains most common
 east of the Alleghanies Nests from the Gulf States to Labrador
 and Manitoba winters south of Gulf States to Panama
Migrations  May September Common summer resident

Given a piece of marshy ground with an abundance of skunk cabbage and a
fairly dense growth of saplings and near by a tangle of green brier and
blackberry and you will be pretty sure to have it tenanted by a pair of
yellowthroats says Dr Abbott who found several of their nests in
skunkcabbage plants which he says are favorite cradles No animal cares to
touch this plant if it can be avoided but have the birds themselves no sense
of smell

Before and after the nesting season these active birds plump of form elegant
of attire forceful but not bold enter the scrubby pastures near our houses
and the shrubbery of old fashioned overgrown gardens and peer out at the
human wanderer therein with a charming curiosity The bright eyes of the male
masquerader shine through his black mask where he intently watches you from
the tangle of syringa and snowball bushes and as he flies into the laburnum
with its golden chain of blossoms that pale before the yellow of his throat
and breast you are so impressed with his grace and elegance that you follow
too audaciously he thinks and off he goes And yet this is a bird that seems
to delight in being pursued It never goes so far away that you are not
tempted to follow it though it be through dense undergrowth and swampy
thickets and it always gives you just glimpse enough of its beauties and
graces before it flies ahead to invite the hope of a closer inspection next
time When it dives into the deepest part of the tangle where you can imagine
it hunting about among the roots and fallen leaves for the larvae
caterpillars spiders and other insects on which it feeds it sometimes
amuses itself with a simple little song between the hunts But the birds
indifference you feel sure arises from preoccupation rather than rudeness

If however your visit to the undergrowth is unfortunately timed and there
happens to be a bulky nest in process of construction on the ground a quickly
repeated vigorous chit pit quit impatiently inquires the reason for your
bold intrusion Withdraw discreetly and listen to the lovesong that is
presently poured out to reassure his plain little maskless mate The music is
delivered with all the force and energy of his vigorous nature and penetrates
to a surprising distance Follow me follow me follow me many people hear
him say others write the syllables Wichity wichity wichity wichity and
still others write them I beseech you I beseech you I beseech you though
the tones of this selfassertive bird rather command than entreat Mr Frank
Chapman says of the yellowthroats They sing throughout the summer and in
August add a flightsong to their repertoire This is usually uttered toward
evening when the bird springs several feet into the air hovers for a second
and then drops back to the bushes


BLACKBURNIAN WARBLER Dendroica blackburnia Wood Warbler family

Called also HEMLOCK WARBLER ORANGETHROATED WARBLER TORCHBIRD

Length  45 to 55 inches An inch and a half smaller than the
 English sparrow
Male  Head black striped with orangeflame throat and breast
 orange shading through yellow to white underneath wings
 tail and part of back black with white markings
Female  Olivebrown above shading into yellow on breast and
 paler under parts
Range  Eastern North America to plains Winters in tropics
Migrations  May September Spring and autumn migrant

The orangethroated warbler would seem to be his right name his
characteristic cognomen says John Burroughs in everdelightful Wake
Robin but no he is doomed to wear the name of some discoverer perhaps the
first who robbed his nest or rifled him of his mate  Blackburn hence
Blackburnian warbler The burn seems appropriate enough for in these dark
evergreens his throat and breast show like flame He has a very fine warble
suggesting that of the redstart but not especially musical

No foliage is dense enough to hide and no autumnal tint too brilliant to
outshine this luminous little bird that in May as it migrates northward to
its nesting ground darts in and out of the leafy shadows like a tongue of
fire

It is by far the most glorious of all the warblers  a sort of diminutive
oriole The quietcolored little mate flits about after him apparently lost
in admiration of his fine feathers and the ease with which his thin tenor
voice can end his lovers warble in a high Z

Take a good look at this attractive couple for in May they leave us to build
a nest of bark and moss in the evergreens of Canada  that paradise for
warblers  or of the Catskills and Adirondacks and in autumn they hurry
south to escape the first frosts


REDSTART Setophaga ruticilla Wood Warbler family

Called also YELLOWTAILED WARBLER AMERICAN REDSTART AOU 1998

Length  5 to 55 inches
Male  In spring plumage Head neck back and middle breast
 glossy black with blue reflections Breast and underneath
 white slightly flushed with salmon increasing to bright
 salmonorange on the sides of the body and on the wing linings
 Occasional specimens show orangered Tail feathers partly
 black partly orange with broad black band across the end
 Orange markings on wings Bill and feet black In autumn
 Fading into rusty black olive and yellow
Female  Olivebrown and yellow where the male is orange Young
 browner than the females
Range  North America to upper Canada West occasionally as far
 as the Pacific coast but commonly found in summer in the
 Atlantic and Middle States
Migrations  Early May End of September Summer resident

Late some evening early in May when one by one the birds have withdrawn
their voices from the vesper chorus listen for the lingering tsee tsee
tseet usually twelve times repeated in a minute that the redstart sweetly
but rather monotonously sings from the evergreens where as his tiny body
burns in the twilight Mrs Wright likens him to a windblown firebrand half
glowing half charred

But by daylight this brilliant little warbler is constantly on the alert It
is true he has the habit like the flycatchers among which some learned
ornithologists still class him of sitting pensively on a branch with fluffy
feathers and drooping wings but the very next instant he shows true warbler
blood by making a sudden dash upward then downward through the air tumbling
somersaults as if blown by the wind flitting from branch to branch busily
snapping at the tiny insects hidden beneath the leaves clinging to the
treetrunk like a creeper and singing between bites

Possibly he will stop long enough in his mad chase to open and shut his tail
fanfashion with a dainty egotism that in the peacock becomes rank vanity

The Germans call this little bird roth Stert red tail but like so many
popular names this is a misnomer as strictly speaking the redstart is
never red though its salmonorange markings often border on to orangeflame

In a fork of some tall bush or tree placed ten or fifteen feet from the
ground a carefully constructed little nest is made of moss horsehair and
strippings from the bark against which the nest is built the better to
conceal its location Four or five whitish eggs thickly sprinkled with pale
brown and lilac like the other warblers are too jealously guarded by the
little motherbird to be very often seen


BALTIMORE ORIOLE Iderus galbula Oriole and Blackbird family

 black with white spots and edgings Tailquills black with
 yellow markings on the tips Everywhere else orange shading

A flash of fire through the air a rich high whistled song floating in the
wake of the feathered meteor the Baltimore oriole cannot be mistaken When
the orchards are in blossom he arrives in full plumage and song and awaits
the coming of the female birds that travel northward more leisurely in
flocks He is decidedly in evidence No foliage is dense enough to hide his
brilliancy his temper quite as fiery as his feathers leads him into noisy
quarrels and his insistent song with its martial interrogative notes becomes
almost tiresome until he is happily mated and family cares check his
enthusiasm

Among the best architects in the world is his plain but energetic mate
Gracefully swung from a high branch of some tall tree the nest is woven with
exquisite skill into a long flexible pouch that rain cannot penetrate nor
wind shake from its horsehair moorings Bits of string threads of silk and
sometimes yarn of the gayest colors if laid about the shrubbery in the
garden will be quickly interwoven with the shreds of bark and milkweed stalks
that the bird has found afield The shape of the nest often differs because
in unsettled regions where hawks abound it is necessary to make it deeper
than seven inches the customary depth when it is built near the homes of
men and to partly close it at the top to conceal the sitting bird From four
to six whitish eggs scrawled over with blackbrown are hatched by the mother
oriole and most jealously guarded by her now truly domesticated mate

The number of grubs worms flies caterpillars and even cocoons that go to
satisfy the hunger of a family of orioles in a day might indicate if it
could be computed the great value these birds are about our homes aside from
the good cheer they bring

There is a popular tradition about the naming of this gorgeous bird When
George Calvert the first Lord Baltimore worn out and discouraged by various
hardships in his Newfoundland colony decided to visit Virginia in 1628 he
wrote that nothing in the Chesapeake country so impressed him as the myriads
of birds in its woods But the song and color of the oriole particularly
cheered and delighted him and orange and black became the heraldic colors of
the first lords proprietors of Maryland

 Hush tis he My Oriole my glance of summer fire
 Is come at last and ever on the watch
 Twitches the packthread I had lightly wound
 About the bough to help his housekeeping
 Twitches and scouts by turns blessing his luck
 Yet fearing me who laid it in his way
 Nor more than wiser we in our affairs
 Divines the Providence that hides and helps
 Heave ho Heave ho he whistles as the twine
 Slackens its hold once more now and a flash
 Lightens across the sunlight to the elm
 Where his mate dangles at her cup of felt

 and more common during the summer in States north of Virginia
 especially in Ohio south of which it is resident throughout
 the year
Migrations  Resident rather than migrating birds remaining
 throughout the winter in localities where they have found their
 way Travel in flocks

Among the numerous names by which this beautiful bird is known it has become
immortalized under the title of Mr James Lane Allens exquisite book The
Kentucky Cardinal Here while we are given a most charmingly sympathetic
delicate account of the bird who has only to be seen or heard and Death
adjusts an arrow it is the cardinals pathetic fate that impresses one most
Seen through less poetical eyes however the bird appears to be a haughty
autocrat a sort of F F V among the feathered tribes as indeed his
title Virginia redbird has been unkindly said to imply Bearing himself
with a refined and courtly dignity not stooping to soil his feet by walking
on the ground like the more democratic robin or even condescending below the
level of the laurel bushes the cardinal is literally a shining example of
selfconscious superiority  a bird to call forth respect and admiration
rather than affection But a group of cardinals in a cedar tree in a snowy
winter landscape makes us forgetful of everything but their supreme beauty

As might be expected in one of the finch family the cardinal is a songster 
the fact which in connection with his lovely plumage accounts for the number
of these birds shipped in cages to Europe where they are known as Virginia
nightingales Commencing with a strong rich whistle like the high notes of a
fife Cheocheocheocheo repeated over and over as if to make perfect the
start of a song he is about to sing suddenly he stops and you learn that
there is to be no glorious performance after all only a prelude to 
nothing The song such as it is begins with both male and female in March
and lasts with a brief intermission until September  the most melodious
sigh as Mr Allen calls it Early in May the cardinals build a bulky and
loosely made nest usually in the holly laurel or other evergreen shrubs
that they always love to frequent especially if these are near fields of corn
or other grain And often two broods in a year come forth from the palegray
brownmarked eggs beating what is literally for them the fatal gift of
beauty


SUMMER TANAGER Piranga rubra Tanager family

Called also REDBIRD SMOOTHHEADED REDBIRD

Length  75 inches About onefourth smaller than the robin
Male  Uniform red Wings and tail like the body
Female  Upper parts yellowish olivegreen underneath inclining
 to orangeyellow
Range  Tropical portions of two Americas and eastern United
 States Most common in Southern States Rare north of
 Pennsylvania Winters in the tropics Mirations  In Southern
 States April October Irregular migrant north of the
 Carolinas

Thirty years ago it is recorded that so far north as New Jersey the summer
redbird was quite as common as any of the thrushes In the South still there
is scarcely an orchard that does not contain this tropicallooking beauty 
the redbird par excellence the sweetest singer of the family Is there a more
beautiful sight in all nature than a grove of orange trees laden with fruit
starred with their delicious blossoms and with flocks of redbirds disporting
themselves among the dark glossy leaves Pine and oak woods are also favorite
resorts especially at the north where the bird nowadays forsakes the
orchards to hide his beauty if he can unharmed by the rifle that only rarely
is offered so shining a mark He shows the scarlet tanagers preference for
treetops where his musical voice calling Chickytuckytuk alone betrays
his presence in the woods The Southern farmers declare that he is an
infallible weather prophet his wet WET WET being the certain indication
of rain  another absurd saw for the callnote is by no means confined to
the rainy season

The yellowisholive mate whose quiet colors betray no nest secrets collects
twigs and grasses for the cradle to be saddled on the end of some horizontal
branch though in this work the male sometimes cautiously takes an
insignificant part After her three or four eggs are laid she sits upon them
for nearly two weeks being only rarely and stealthily visited by her mate
with some choice grub blossom or berry in his beak But how cheerfully his
fifelike whistle rings out during the temporary exile Then his song is at
its best Later in the summer he has an aggravating way of joining in the
chorus of other birds songs by which the pleasant individuality of his own
voice is lost

A nest of these tanagers observed not far from New York City was commenced
the last week of May on the extreme edge of a hickory limb in an open wood
four eggs were laid on the fourth of June and twelve days later the tiny
fledglings that all look like their mother in the early stages of their
existence burst from the greenishwhite speckled shells In less than a
month the young birds were able to fly quite well and collect their food


SCARLET TANAGER Piranga erythromelas Tanager family

Called also BLACKWINGED REDBIRD FIREBIRD CANADA TANAGER
 POCKETBIRD

Length  7 to 75 inches About onefourth smaller than the
 robin
Male  In spring plumage Brilliant scarlet with black wings
 And tail Under wing coverts grayish white In autumn Similar
 To female
Female  Olivegreen above wings and tail dark lightly
 Margined with olive Underneath greenish yellow
Range  North America to northern Canada boundaries and

Migrations  May October Summer resident

The gorgeous coloring of the scarlet tanager has been its snare and
destruction The densest evergreens could not altogether hide this blazing
target for the sportsmans gun too often fired at the instigation of city
milliners Fine feathers make fine birds  and cruel silly women the
adage might be adapted for latterday use This rarely beautiful tanager
thanks to them is now only an infrequent flash of beauty in our country
roads

Instinct leads it to be chary of its charms and whereas it used to be one of
the commonest of bird neighbors it is now shy and solitary An ideal resort
for it is a grove of oak or swamp maple near a stream or pond where it can
bathe Evergreen trees too are favorites possibly because the bird knows
how exquisitely its bright scarlet coat is set off by their dark background

High in the treetops he perches all unsuspected by the visitor passing
through the woods below until a burst of rich sweet melody directs the
operaglasses suddenly upward There we detect him carolling loud and
cheerfully like a robin He is an apparition of beauty  a veritable bird of
paradise as indeed he is sometimes called Because of their similar
coloring the tanager and cardinal are sometimes confounded but an instants
comparison of the two birds shows nothing in common except red feathers and
even those of quite different shades The inconspicuous olivegreen and yellow
of the female tanagers plumage is another striking instance of Natures
unequal distribution of gifts but if our brightcolored birds have become
shockingly few under existing conditions would any at all remain were the
females prominent like the males as they brood upon the nest Both tanagers
construct a rather disorderlylooking nest of fibres and sticks through which
daylight can be seen where it rests securely upon the horizontal branch of
some oak or pine tree but as soon as three or four bluishgreen eggs have
been laid in the cradle off goes the father wearing his telltale coat to a
distant tree There he sings his sweetest carol to the patient brooding mate
returning to her side only long enough to feed her with the insects and
berries that form their food

Happily for the young birds fate they are clothed at first in motley dull
colors with here and there only a bright touch of scarlet yellow and olive
to prove their claim to the parent whose gorgeous plumage must be their
admiration But after the moulting season it would be a wise tanager that knew
its own father His scarlet feathers are now replaced by an autumn coat of
olive and yellow not unlike his mates

from the evergreen woods where their red feathers shining against the
darkgreen background of the trees give them charming prominence but they
also feed freely upon the buds of various deciduous trees

South of Canada we may not look for them except in the severest winter
weather Even then their coming is not to be positively depended upon but
when their caprice  or was it an unusually fierce northern blast  sends
them over the Canada border it is a simple matter to identify them when such
brilliant birds are rare The brownishyellow and grayish females and young
males however always seem to be in the majority with us though our Canadian
friends assure us of the irreproachable morals of this gay bird

Wherever there are clusters of pine or cedar trees when there is a flock of
pine grosbeaks in the neighborhood you may expect to find a pair of birds
diligently feeding upon the seeds and berries No cheerful note escapes them
as they persistently gormandize and if the truth must be confessed they
appear to be rather stupid and uninteresting albeit they visit us at a time
when we are most inclined to rapture over our bird visitors They are said to
have a deliciously sweet song in the nesting season When however few except
the Canadian voyageurs hear it


AMERICAN CROSSBILL Loxia curvirostra minor Finch family

Called also RED CROSSBILL AOU 1998

Length  6 to 7 inches About the size of the English sparrow
Male  General color Indian red passing into brownish gray
 with red tinge beneath Wings without bands also tail
 brown Beak crossed at the tip
Female  General color greenish yellow with brownish tints
 Dullyellowish tints on head throat breast and underneath
 Wings and tail pale brown Beak crossed at tip
Range  Pennsylvania to northern British America West of
 Mississippi range more southerly
Migrations  Irregular winter visitor November Sometimes
 resident until April

It is a rash statement to say that a bird is rare simply because you have
never seen it in your neighborhood for while you are going out of the front
door your rara avis may be eating the crumbs about your kitchen Even with our
eyes and ears constantly alert for some fresh bird excitement our phlegmatic
neighbor over the way may be enjoying a visit from a whole flock of the very
bird we have been looking and listening for in vain all the year The red
crossbills are capricious little visitors it is true but by no means
uncommon

About the size of an English sparrow of a brick or Indian red color for the
most part the peculiarity of its parrotlike beak is its certain mark of
identification

Longfellow has rendered into verse the German legend of the crossbill which
tells that as the Saviour hung upon the cross a little bird tried to pull out
the nails that pierced His hands and feet thus twisting its beak and staining
its feathers with the blood

At first glance the birds would seem to be hampered by their crossed beaks in
getting at the seeds in the pine cones  a superficial criticism when the
thoroughness and admirable dexterity of their work are better understood

Various seeds of fruits berries and the buds of trees enlarge their bill of
fare They are said to be inordinately fond of salt Mr Romeyn B Hough tells
of a certain old icecream freezer that attracted flocks of crossbills one
winter as a saltlick attracts deer Whether the traditional salt that may
have stuck to the birds tail is responsible for its tameness is not related
but it is certain the crossbills like most bird visitors from the far north
are remarkably gentle friendly little birds As they swing about the pine
trees parrotfashion with the help of their bill calling out kimp kimp
that sounds like the snapping of the pine cones on a sunny day it often seems
easily possible to catch them with the hand

There is another species of crossbill called the Whitewinged Loxia
leucoptera that differs from the preceding chiefly in having two white bands
across its wings and in being more rare


THE REDPOLL Acanthis linaria Finch family

Called also REDPOLL LINNET LITTLE SNOWBIRD LESSER REDPOLL
 COMMON REDPOLL AOU 1998

Length  525 to 55 inches About an inch shorter than the
 English sparrow
Male  A rich crimson wash on head neck breast and lower
 back that is sometimes only a pink when we see the bird in
 midwinter Grayishbrown sparrowy feathers show underneath the
 red wash Dusky wings and tail the feathers more or less edged
 with whitish Soiled white underneath the sides with dusky
 streaks Bill sharply pointed
Female  More dingy than male sides more heavily streaked and
 having crimson only on the crown
Range  An arctic bird that descends irregularly into the
 Northern United States
Migrations  An irregular winter visitor

Ere long amid the cold and powdery snow as it were a fruit of the season
will come twittering a flock of delicate crimsontinged birds lesser
redpolls to sport and feed on the buds just ripe for them on the sunny side
of a wood shaking down the powdery snow there in their cheerful feeding as
if it were high midsummer to them Thoreaus beautiful description of these
tiny winter visitors which should be read entire shows the man in one of his
most sympathetic exalted moods and it is the best brief characterization of
the redpoll that we have

When the arctic cold becomes too cruel for even the snowbirds and crossbills
to withstand flocks of the sociable little redpolls flying southward are the
merest specks in the sullen gray sky when they can be seen at all So high
do they keep that often they must pass above our heads without our knowing it
First we see a quantity of tiny dots like a shake of pepper in the cloud
above then the specks grow larger and larger and finally the birds seem to
drop from the sky upon some tall tree that they completely cover  a
veritable cloudburst of birds Without pausing to rest after the long journey
down they flutter into the weedy pastures with much cheerful twittering to
feed upon whatever seeds may be protruding through the snow Every action of a
flock seems to be concerted as if some rigid disciplinarian had drilled them
and yet no leader can be distinguished in the merry company When one flies
all fly where one feeds all feed and by some subtle telepathy all rise at
the identical instant from their feeding ground and cheerfully twitter in
concert where they all alight at once They are more easily disturbed than the
goldfinches that are often seen feeding with them in the lowlands
nevertheless they quite often venture into our gardens and orchards even in
suburbs penetrated by the trolleycar

Usually in winter we hear only their lisping callnote but if the birds
linger late enough in the spring when their fancy lightly turns to thoughts
of love a gleeful canarylike song comes from the naked branches and we
may know by it that the flock will soon disappear for their nesting grounds in
the northern forests

The Greater Redpoll Acanthis linaria rostrata may be distinguished from the
foregoing species by its slightly larger size darker upper parts and
shorter stouter bill But the notes habits and general appearance of both
redpolls are so nearly identical that the birds are usually mistaken for each
other


PURPLE FINCH Carpodacus purpureus Finch family

Called also PURPLE LINNET

Length  6 to 625 inches About the same size as the English
 sparrow
Male  Until two years old sparrowlike in appearance like the
 female but with oliveyellow on chin and lower back
 Afterwards entire body suffused with a bright raspberryred
 deepest on head lower back and breast and other parts only
 faintly washed with this color More brown on back and wings
 and tail which are dusky have some reddish brown feathers
 Underneath grayish white Bill heavy Tail forked
Female  Grayish olive brown above whitish below finely
 Streaked everywhere with very dark brown like a sparrow Sides
 of breast have arrowshaped marks Wings and tail darkest
Range  North America from Columbia River eastward to Atlantic
 and from Mexico northward to Manitoba Most common in Middle
 States and New England Winters south of Pennsylvania
Migrations  March November Common summer resident Rarely
 individuals winter at the north

In this much besparrowed country of ours familiarity is apt to breed
contempt for any bird that looks sparrowy in which case one of the most
delicious songsters we have might easily be overlooked It is not until the
purple finch reaches maturity in his second year that his plumage takes on the
raspberryred tints that some ornithologists named purple Oriental purple is
our magenta it is true but not a raspberry shade Before maturity but for
the yellow on his lower back and throat he and his mate alike suggest a
songsparrow and it is important to note their particularly heavy rounded
bills with the tufts of feathers at the base and their forked tails to name
them correctly But the identification of the purple finch after all depends
quite as much upon his song as his color In March when flocks of these birds
come north he has begun to sing a little by the beginning of May he is
desperately in love and sudden joyous peals of music from the elm or
evergreen trees on the lawn enliven the garden How could his little brown
ladylove fail to be impressed with a suitor so gayly dressed so tender and
solicitous so deliciously sweetvoiced With fuller richer song than the
warbling vireos which Nuttall has said it resembles a perfect ecstasy of
love pours incessantly from his throat during the early summer days There is
a suggestion of the robins lovesong in his but its copiousness variety and
rapidity give it a character all its own

In some old neglected hedge or low tree about the countryplace a flat grassy
nest lined with horsehair contains four or five green eggs in June and the
old birds are devotion itself to each other and soon to their young sparrowy
brood

But when parental duties are over the finches leave our lawns and gardens to
join flocks of their own kind in more remote orchards or woods their favorite
haunts Their subdued warble may be heard during October and later as if the
birds were humming to themselves

Much is said of their fondness for fruit blossoms and tree buds but the truth
is that noxious insects and seeds of grain constitute their food in summer
the berries of evergreens in winter To a bird so gay of color charming of
voice social and trustful of disposition surely a few blossoms might be
spared without grudging


THE AMERICAN ROBIN Merula migratoria Thrush family

Called also REDBREASTED OR MIGRATORY THRUSH ROBINREDBREAST

Length  10 inches
Male  Dull brownish olivegray above Head black tail brownish
 black with exterior feathers white at inner tip Wings dark
 brownish Throat streaked with black and white White eyelids
 Entire breast bright rusty red whitish below the tail
Female  Duller and with paler breast resembling the male in
 autumn
Range  North America from Mexico to arctic regions
Migrations  March October or November Often resident
 throughout the year

It seems almost superfluous to write a line of description about a bird that
is as familiar as a chicken yet how can this nearest of our bird neighbors be
passed without a reference Probably he was the very first bird we learned to
call by name

The early English colonists who had doubtless been brought up like the rest
of us on The Babes in the Wood named the bird after the only heroes in
that melancholy tale but in reality the American robin is a much larger bird
than the English
robinredbreast and less brilliantly colored John Burroughs calls him of all
our birds the most native and democratic

How the robin dominates birddom with his strong aggressive personality His
voice rings out strong and clear in the early morning chorus and more
tenderly subdued at twilight it still rises above all the sleepy notes about
him Whether lightly tripping over the lawn after the early worm or rising
with his sharp quick cry of alarm when startled to his nest near by every
motion is decided alert and free No pensive hermit of the woods like his
cousins the thrushes is this joyous vigorous bird of the morning Such a
presence is inspiriting

Does any bird excel the robin in the great variety of his vocal expressions
Mr Parkhurst in his charming Birds Calendar says he knows of no other
bird that is able to give so many shades of meaning to a single note running
through the entire gamut of its possible feelings From the soft and mellow
quality almost as coaxing as a doves note with which it encourages its
young when just out of the nest the tone with minute gradations becomes
more vehement and then harsh and with quickened reiteration until it
expresses the greatest intensity of a birds emotions Love contentment
anxiety exultation rage  what other bird can throw such multifarious
meaning into its tone And herein the robin seems more nearly human than any
of its kind

There is no one thing that attracts more birds about the house that a
drinkingdish  large enough for a bathtub as well and certainly no bird
delights in sprinkling the water over his back more than a robin often aided
in his ablutions by the spattering of the sparrows But see to it that this
drinkingdish is well raised above the reach of lurking cats

While the robin is a famous splasher his neatness stops there A robins nest
is notoriously dirty within and so carelessly constructed of weedstalks
grass and mud that a heavy summer shower brings more robins nests to the
ground than we like to contemplate The color of the eggs as every one knows
has given their name to the tint Four is the number of eggs laid and two
broods are often reared in the same nest

Too much stress is laid on the mischief done by the robins in the cherry trees
and strawberry patches and too little upon the quantity of worms and insects
they devour Professor Treadwell who experimented upon some young robins kept
in captivity learned that they ate sixtyeight earthworms daily  that is
each bird ate fortyone per cent more than its own weight in twelve hours The
length of these worms if laid end to end would be about fourteen feet Man
at this rate would eat about seventy pounds of flesh a day and drink five or
six gallons of water


ORCHARD ORIOLE Icterus spurius Blackbird and Oriole family

Called also ORCHARD STARLING ORCHARD HANGNEST

Length  7 to 73 inches About onefourth smaller than the
 robin
Male  Head throat upper back tail and part of wings black
 Breast rump shoulders under wing and tail coverts and under
 parts bright reddish brown Whitishyellow markings on a few
 tail and wing feathers
Female  Head and upper parts olive shading into brown
 brighter on head and near tail Back and wings dusky brown
 with palebuff shoulderbars and edges of coverts Throat
 black Under parts olive shading into yellow
Range  Canada to Central America Common in temperate latitudes
 of the United States
Migrations  Early May Middle of September Common summer
 resident

With a more southerly range than the Baltimore oriole and less conspicuous
coloring the orchard oriole is not so familiar a bird in many Northern
States where nevertheless it is quite common enough to be classed among our
wouldbe intimates The orchard is not always as close to the house as this
bird cares to venture he will pursue an insect even to the piazza vines

His song says John Burroughs is like scarlet strong intense emphatic
but it is sweet and is more rapidly uttered than that of others of the family
It is ended for the season early in July

This oriole too builds a beautiful nest not often pendent like the
Baltimores but securely placed in the fork of a sturdy fruit tree at a
moderate height and woven with skill and precision like a basket When the
dried grasses from one of these nests were stretched and measured all were
found to be very nearly the same length showing to what pains the little
weaver had gone to make the nest neat and pliable yet strong Four
cloudywhite eggs with darkbrown spots are usually found in the nest in June
