THE DAWN OF A TOMORROW

by

FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT







I

There are always two ways of looking at a thing frequently there are
six or seven but two ways of looking at a London fog are quite enough
When it is thick and yellow in the streets and stings a mans throat and
lungs as he breathes it an awakening in the early morning is either an
unearthly and grewsome or a mysteriously enclosing secluding and
comfortable thing If one awakens in a healthy body and with a clear
brain rested by normal sleep and retaining memories of a normally
agreeable yesterday one may lie watching the housemaid building the
fire and after she has swept the hearth and put things in order lie
watching the flames of the blazing and crackling wood catch the coals
and set them blazing also and dancing merrily and filling corners with
a glow and in so lying and realizing that leaping light and warmth and
a soft bed are good things one may turn over on ones back stretching
arms and legs luxuriously drawing deep breaths and smiling at a
knowledge of the fog outside which makes halfpast eight oclock on a
December morning as dark as twelve oclock on a December night Under
such conditions the soft thick yellow gloom has its picturesque and
even humorous aspect One feels enclosed by it at once fantastically
and cosily and is inclined to revel in imaginings of the picture
outside its Rembrandt lights and orange yellows the halos about the
streetlamps the illumination of shopwindows the flare of torches
stuck up over coster barrows and coffeestands the shadows on the faces
of the men and women selling and buying beside them Refreshed by sleep
and comfort and surrounded by light warmth and good cheer it is easy
to face the day to confront going out into the fog and feeling a sort
of pleasure in its mysteries This is one way of looking at it but
only one

The other way is marked by enormous differences

A manhe had given his name to the people of the house as Antony Dart
awakened in a thirdstory bedroom in a lodginghouse in a poor street in
London and as his consciousness returned to him its slow and reluctant
movings confronted the second point of viewmarked by enormous
differences He had not slept two consecutive hours through the night
and when he had slept he had been tormented by dreary dreams which were
more full of misery because of their elusive vagueness which kept his
tortured brain on a wearying strain of effort to reach some definite
understanding of them Yet when he awakened the consciousness of being
again alive was an awful thing If the dreams could have faded into
blankness and all have passed with the passing of the night how he
could have thanked whatever gods there be Only not to awakeonly not
to awake But he had awakened

The clock struck nine as he did so consequently he knew the hour The
lodginghouse slavey had aroused him by coming to light the fire She
had set her candle on the hearth and done her work as stealthily as
possible but he had been disturbed though he had made a desperate
effort to struggle back into sleep That was no useno use He was
awake and he was in the midst of it all again Without the sense of
luxurious comfort he opened his eyes and turned upon his back throwing
out his arms flatly so that he lay as in the form of a cross in heavy
weariness and anguish For months he had awakened each morning after
such a night and had so lain like a crucified thing

As he watched the painful flickering of the damp and smoking wood and
coal he remembered this and thought that there had been a lifetime of
such awakenings not knowing that the morbidness of a fagged brain
blotted out the memory of more normal days and told him fantastic lies
which were but a hundredth part truth He could see only the hundredth
part truth and it assumed proportions so huge that he could see nothing
else In such a state the human brain is an infernal machine and its
workings can only be conquered if the mortal thing which lives with it
day and night night and dayhas learned to separate its controllable
from its seemingly uncontrollable atoms and can silence its clamor on
its way to madness

Antony Dart had not learned this thing and the clamor had had its
hideous way with him Physicians would have given a name to his mental
and physical condition He had heard these names oftenapplied to men
the strain of whose lives had been like the strain of his own and had
left them as it had left himjaded joyless breaking things Some of
them had been broken and had died or were dragging out bruised and
tormented days in their own homes or in madhouses He always shuddered
when he heard their names and rebelled with sick fear against the mere
mention of them They had worked as he had worked they had been
stricken with the delirium of accumulationaccumulationas he had
been They had been caught in the rush and swirl of the great
maelstrom and had been borne round and round in it until having
grasped every coveted thing tossing upon its circling waters they
themselves had been flung upon the shore with both hands full the rocks
about them strewn with rich possessions while they lay prostrate and
gazed at all life had brought with dull hopeless anguished eyes He
knewif the worst came to the worstwhat would be said of him
because he had heard it said of others He worked too hardhe worked
too hard He was sick of hearing it What was wrong with the world
what was wrong with man as Manif work could break him like this If
one believed in Deity the living creature It breathed into being must
be a perfect thingnot one to be wearied sickened tortured by the
life Its breathing had created A mere man would disdain to build a
thing so poor and incomplete A mere human engineer who constructed an
engine whose workings were perpetually at faultwhich went wrong when
called upon to do the labor it was made forwho would not scoff at it
and cast it aside as a piece of worthless bungling

Something is wrong he muttered lying flat upon his cross and staring
at the yellow haze which had crept through crannies in windowsashes
into the room Someone is wrong Is it Ior You

His thin lips drew themselves back against his teeth in a mirthless
smile which was like a grin

Yes he said I am pretty far gone I am beginning to talk to
myself about God Bryan did it just before he was taken to Dr
Hewletts place and cut his throat

He had not led a specially evil life he had not broken laws but the
subject of Deity was not one which his scheme of existence had included
When it had haunted him of late he had felt it an untoward and morbid
sign The thing had drawn himdrawn him he had complained against it
he had argued sometimes he knewshudderingthat he had raved
Something had seemed to stand aside and watch his being and his
thinking Something which filled the universe had seemed to wait and to
have waited through all the eternal ages to see what heone manwould
do At times a great appalled wonder had swept over him at his
realization that he had never known or thought of it before It had
been there alwaysthrough all the ages that had passed And
sometimesonce or twicethe thought had in some unspeakable
untranslatable way brought him a moments calm

But at other times he had said to himselfwith a shivering soul
cowering within himthat this was only part of it all and was a
beginning perhaps of religious monomania

During the last week he had known what he was going to dohe had made
up his mind This abject horror through which others had let themselves
be dragged to madness or death he would not endure The end should come
quickly and no one should be smitten aghast by seeing or knowing
how it came In the crowded shabbier streets of London there were
lodginghouses where one by taking precautions could end his life in
such a manner as would blot him out of any world where such a man as
himself had been known A pistol properly managed would obliterate
resemblance to any human thing Months ago through chance talk he had
heard how it could be doneand done quickly He could leave a
misleading letter He had planned what it should bethe story it should
tell of a disheartened mediocre venturer of his poor all returning
bankrupt and humiliated from Australia ending existence in such
pennilessness that the parish must give him a paupers grave What did
it matter where a man lay so that he sleptsleptslept Surely with
ones brains scattered one would sleep soundly anywhere

He had come to the house the night before dressed shabbily with the
pitiable respectability of a defeated man He had entered droopingly
with bent shoulders and hopeless hang of head In his own sphere he was
a man who held himself well He had let fall a few dispirited sentences
when he had engaged his back room from the woman of the house and she
had recognized him as one of the luckless In fact she had hesitated a
moment before his unreliable look until he had taken out money from his
pocket and paid his rent for a week in advance She would have that at
least for her trouble he had said to himself He should not occupy the
room after tomorrow In his own home some days would pass before his
household began to make inquiries He had told his servants that he was
going over to Paris for a change He would be safe and deep in his
paupers grave a week before they asked each other why they did not hear
from him All was in order One of the mocking agonies was that living
was done for He had ceased to live Work pleasure sun moon and
stars had lost their meaning He stood and looked at the most radiant
loveliness of land and sky and sea and felt nothing Success brought
greater wealth each day without stirring a pulse of pleasure even in
triumph There was nothing left but the awful days and awful nights to
which he knew physicians could give their scientific name but had
no healing for He had gone far enough He would go no farther
Tomorrow it would have been over long hours And there would have been
no public declaiming over the humiliating pitifulness of his end And
what did it matter

How thick the fog was outsidethick enough for a man to lose himself
in it The yellow mist which had crept in under the doors and through
the crevices of the windowsashes gave a ghostly look to the rooma
ghastly abnormal look he said to himself The fire was smouldering
instead of blazing But what did it matter He was going out He had
not bought the pistol last nightlike a fool Somehow his brain had
been so tired and crowded that he had forgotten

Forgotten He mentally repeated the word as he got out of bed By
this time tomorrow he should have forgotten everything THIS TIME
TOMORROW His mind repeated that also as he began to dress himself
Where should he be Should he be anywhere Suppose he awakened again
to something as bad as this How did a man get out of his body After
the crash and shock what happened Did one find oneself standing beside
the Thing and looking down at it It would not be a good thing to stand
and look down oneven for that which had deserted it But having torn
oneself loose from it and its devilish aches and pains one would not
careone would see how little it all mattered Anything else must be
better than thisthe thing for which there was a scientific name but no
healing He had taken all the drugs he had obeyed all the medical
orders and here he was after that last hell of a nightdressing
himself in a back bedroom of a cheap lodginghouse to go out and buy a
pistol in this damned fog

He laughed at the last phrase of his thought the laugh which was a
mirthless grin

I am thinking of it as if I was afraid of taking cold he said And
tomorrow

There would be no Tomorrow Tomorrows were at an end No more
nightsno more daysno more morrows

He finished dressing putting on his discriminatingly chosen
shabbygenteel clothes with a care for the effect he intended them to
produce The collar and cuffs of his shirt were frayed and yellow and
he fastened his collar with a pin and tied his worn necktie carelessly
His overcoat was beginning to wear a greenish shade and look threadbare
so was his hat When his toilet was complete he looked at himself in the
cracked and hazy glass bending forward to scrutinize his unshaven face
under the shadow of the dingy hat

It is all right he muttered It is not far to the pawnshop where I
saw it

The stillness of the room as he turned to go out was uncanny As it was
a back room there was no street below from which could arise sounds of
passing vehicles and the thickness of the fog muffled such sound as
might have floated from the front He stopped halfway to the door not
knowing why and listened To whatfor what The silence seemed to
spread through all the houseout into the streetsthrough all
Londonthrough all the world and he to stand in the midst of it a man
on the way to Deathwith no Tomorrow

What did it mean It seemed to mean something The world withdrawn
life withdrawnsound withdrawnbreath withdrawn He stood and waited
Perhaps this was one of the symptoms of the morbid thing for which there
was that name If so he had better get away quickly and have it over
lest he be found wandering about not knowingnot knowing But now he
knewthe Silence He waitedwaited and tried to hear as if
something was calling himcalling without sound It returned to him
the thought of That which had waited through all the ages to see what
heone manwould do He had never exactly pitied himself beforehe
did not know that he pitied himself now but he was a man going to his
death and a light cold sweat broke out on him and it seemed as if it
was not he who did it but some otherhe flung out his arms and cried
aloud words he had not known he was going to speak

Lord Lord What shall I do to be saved

But the Silence gave no answer It was the Silence still

And after standing a few moments panting his arms fell and his head
dropped and turning the handle of the door he went out to buy the
pistol

II

As he went down the narrow staircase covered with its dingy and
threadbare carpet he found the house so full of dirty yellow haze that
he realized that the fog must be of the extraordinary ones which are
remembered in afteryears as abnormal specimens of their kind He
recalled that there had been one of the sort three years before and
that traffic and business had been almost entirely stopped by it that
accidents had happened in the streets and that people having lost their
way had wandered about turning corners until they found themselves far
from their intended destinations and obliged to take refuge in hotels or
the houses of hospitable strangers Curious incidents had occurred and
odd stories were told by those who had felt themselves obliged by
circumstances to go out into the baffling gloom He guessed that
something of a like nature had fallen upon the town again The
gaslight on the landings and in the melancholy hall burned feeblyso
feebly that one got but a vague view of the rickety hatstand and the
shabby overcoats and headgear hanging upon it It was well for him
that he had but a corner or so to turn before he reached the pawnshop in
whose window he had seen the pistol he intended to buy

When he opened the streetdoor he saw that the fog was upon the whole
perhaps even heavier and more obscuring if possible than the one so
well remembered He could not see anything three feet before him he
could not see with distinctness anything two feet ahead The sensation
of stepping forward was uncertain and mysterious enough to be almost
appalling A man not sufficiently cautious might have fallen into any
open hole in his path Antony Dart kept as closely as possible to the
sides of the houses It would have been easy to walk off the pavement
into the middle of the street but for the edges of the curb and the step
downward from its level Traffic had almost absolutely ceased though
in the more important streets linkboys were making efforts to guide
men or fourwheelers slowly along The blind feeling of the thing was
rather awful Though but few pedestrians were out Dart found himself
once or twice brushing against or coming into forcible contact with men
feeling their way about like himself

One turn to the right he repeated mentally two to the left and the
place is at the corner of the other side of the street

He managed to reach it at last but it had been a slow and therefore
long journey All the gasjets the little shop owned were lighted but
even under their flare the articles in the windowthe one or two once
cheaply gaudy dresses and shawls and mens garmentshung in the haze
like the dreary dangling ghosts of things recently executed Among
watches and forlorn pieces of oldfashioned jewelry and odds and ends
the pistol lay against the folds of a dirty gauze shawl There it was
It would have been annoying if someone else had been beforehand and had
bought it

Inside the shop more dangling spectres hung and the place was almost
dark It was a shabby pawnshop and the man lounging behind the counter
was a shabby man with an unshaven unamiable face

I want to look at that pistol in the righthand corner of your window
Antony Dart said

The pawnbroker uttered a sound something between a halflaugh and a
grunt He took the weapon from the window

Antony Dart examined it critically He must make quite sure of it He
made no further remark He felt he had done with speech

Being told the price asked for the purchase he drew out his purse and
took the money from it After making the payment he noted that he still
possessed a fivepound note and some sovereigns There passed through
his mind a wonder as to who would spend it The most decent thing
perhaps would be to give it away If it was in his roomtomorrow
the parish would not bury him and it would be safer that the parish
should

He was thinking of this as he left the shop and began to cross the
street Because his mind was wandering he was less watchful Suddenly
a rubbertired hansom moving without sound appeared immediately in his
paththe horses head loomed up above his own He made the inevitable
involuntary whirl aside to move out of the way the hansom passed and
turning again he went on His movement had been too swift to allow of
his realizing the direction in which his turn had been made He was
wholly unaware that when he crossed the street he crossed backward
instead of forward He turned a corner literally feeling his way went
on turned another and after walking the length of the street suddenly
understood that he was in a strange place and had lost his bearings

This was exactly what had happened to people on the day of the memorable
fog of three years before He had heard them talking of such
experiences and of the curious and baffling sensations they gave rise
to in the brain Now he understood them He could not be far from his
lodgings but he felt like a man who was blind and who had been turned
out of the path he knew He had not the resource of the people whose
stories he had heard He would not stop and address anyone There could
be no certainty as to whom he might find himself speaking to He would
speak to no one He would wander about until he came upon some clew
Even if he came upon none the fog would surely lift a little and become
a trifle less dense in course of time He drew up the collar of his
overcoat pulled his hat down over his eyes and went onhis hand on the
thing he had thrust into a pocket

He did not find his clew as he had hoped and instead of lifting the fog
grew heavier He found himself at last no longer striving for any end
but rambling along mechanically feeling like a man in a dreama
nightmare Once he recognized a weird suggestion in the mystery about
him Tomorrow might one be wandering about aimlessly in some such
haze He hoped not

His lodgings were not far from the Embankment and he knew at last that
he was wandering along it and had reached one of the bridges His mood
led him to turn in upon it and when he reached an embrasure to stop
near it and lean upon the parapet looking down He could not see the
water the fog was too dense but he could hear some faint splashing
against stones He had taken no food and was rather faint What a
strange thing it was to feel faint for want of foodto stand alone cut
off from every other human beingeverything done for No wonder that
sometimes particularly on such days as these there were plunges made
from the parapetno wonder He leaned farther over and strained his
eyes to see some gleam of water through the yellowness But it was not
to be done He was thinking the inevitable thing of course but such a
plunge would not do for him The other thing would destroy all traces

As he drew back he heard something fall with the solid tinkling sound of
coin on the flag pavement When he had been in the pawnbrokers shop he
had taken the gold from his purse and thrust it carelessly into his
waistcoat pocket thinking that it would be easy to reach when he chose
to give it to one beggar or another if he should see some wretch who
would be the better for it Some movement he had made in bending had
caused a sovereign to slip out and it had fallen upon the stones

He did not intend to pick it up but in the moment in which he stood
looking down at it he heard close to him a shuffling movement What he
had thought a bundle of rags or rubbish covered with sackingsome
tramps deserted or forgotten belongingswas stirring It was alive
and as he bent to look at it the sacking divided itself and a small
head covered with a shock of brilliant red hair thrust itself out a
shrewd small face turning to look up at him slyly with deepset black
eyes

It was a human girl creature about twelve years old

Are yer goin to do it she said in a hoarse streetstrained voice
Yer would be a fool if yer didwith as much as that on yer

She pointed with a reddened chapped and dirty hand at the sovereign

Pick it up he said You may have it

Her wild shuffle forward was an actual leap The hand made a snatching
clutch at the coin She was evidently afraid that he was either not in
earnest or would repent The next second she was on her feet and ready
for flight

Stop he said Ive got more to give away

She hesitatednot believing him yet feeling it madness to lose a
chance

MORE she gasped Then she drew nearer to him and a singular change
came upon her face It was a change which made her look oddly human

Gawd mister she said Yer can give away a quid like it was
nothinan yerve got morean yer goin to do THATjes cos yer ad
a bit too much lars night an theres a fog this mornin You take it
straight from medont yer do it I give yer that tip for the suvrink

She was for her years so ugly and so ancient and hardened in voice
and skin and manner that she fascinated him Not that a man who has no
Tomorrow in view is likely to be particularly conscious of mental
processes He was done for but he stood and stared at her What part
of the Power moving the scheme of the universe stood near and thrust him
on in the path designed he did not know thenperhaps never did He was
still holding on to the thing in his pocket but he spoke to her again

What do you mean he asked glumly

She sidled nearer her sharp eyes on his face

I bin watchin yer she said I sat down and pulled the sack over me
ead to breathe inside it an get a bit warm An I see yer come I
knowed wot yer was after I did I watched yer through a ole in me
sack I wasnt goin to call a copper I shouldnt want ter be stopped
meself if I made up me mind I seed a gal dragged out las week an
itd a broke yer art to see er tear er clothes an scream Wot
business ad they preventin er goin off quiet I wouldnt a
stopped yerbut wen the quid fell that made it different

I he said feeling the foolishness of the statement but making it
nevertheless I am ill

Course yer ill Its yer ead Come along er me an get a cup er
cawfee at a stand an buck up If yerve give me that quid straight
wishyermaydieIll go with yer an get a cup myself I aint ad a
bite since yesterdayan t want nothin but a slice o polony
sossidge I found on a dusteap Come on mister

She pulled his coat with her cracked hand He glanced down at it
mechanically and saw that some of the fissures had bled and the
roughened surface was smeared with the blood They stood together in
the small space in which the fog enclosed themhe and shethe man with
no Tomorrow and the girl thing who seemed as old as himself with her
sharp small nose and chin her sharp eyes and voiceand yetperhaps
the fogs enclosing did itsomething drew them together in an uncanny
way Something made him forget the lost clew to the lodginghouse
something made him turn and go with hera thing led in the dark

How can you find your way he said I lost mine

There aint no fog can lose me she answered shuffling along by his
side sides its goin to lift Look at that man comin toards us

It was true that they could see through the orangecolored mist the
approaching figure of a man who was at a yards distance from them Yes
it was lifting slightlyat least enough to allow of ones making a
guess at the direction in which one moved

Where are you going he asked

Apple Blossom Court she answered The cawfeestands in a street
near itand theres a shop where I can buy things

Apple Blossom Court he ejaculated What a name

There aint no appleblossoms there chuckling nor no smell of em
T aint as nice as its nime isApple Blossom Court aint

What do you want to buy A pair of shoes The shoes her naked feet
were thrust into were leprouslooking things through which nearly all
her toes protruded But she chuckled when he spoke

No I m goin to buy a dimond tirarer to go to the opery in she
said dragging her old sack closer round her neck I aint ad a noo un
since I went to the last Drorinroom

It was impudent street chaff but there was cheerful spirit in it and
cheerful spirit has some occult effect upon morbidity Antony Dart did
not smile but he felt a faint stirring of curiosity which was after
all not a bad thing for a man who had not felt an interest for a year

What is it you are going to buy

Im goin to fill me stummick fust with a grin of elation Three
thick slices o bread an drippin an a mug o cawfee An then Im
goin to get sumethin earty to carry to Polly She aint no good
pore thing

Who is she

Stopping a moment to drag up the heel of her dreadful shoe she answered
him with an unprejudiced directness which might have been appalling if
he had been in the mood to be appalled

Aint eighteen an tryin to earn er livin on the street She aint
made for it Little country thing allus frightened to death an ready
to bust out cryin Gents aint goin to stand that A lot of em
wants cheerin up as much as she does Gent as was in liquor last night
knocked er down an give er a black eye T want ill feelin but he
lost his temper an give er a knock casual She cant go out
tonight an shes been uddled up all day cryin for er mother

Where is her mother

In the countryon a farm Polly took a place in a lodginouse an
got in trouble The biby was dead an when she come out o Queen
Charlottes she was took in by a woman an kep She kicked er out in
a week cos of her cryin The life didnt suit er I found er cryin
fit to split er chist one nightcorner o Apple Blossom Courtan I
took care of er

Where

Me chambers grinning top loft of a ouse in the court If anyone
else d ave it I should be turned out Its an ole I can tell yer
but its better than sleepin under the bridges

Take me to see it said Antony Dart I want to see the girl

The words spoke themselves Why should he care to see either cockloft
or girl He did not He wanted to go back to his lodgings with that
which he had come out to buy Yet he said this thing His companion
looked up at him with an expression actually relieved

Would yer tike up with er with eager sharpness as if confronting a
simple business proposition Shes pretty an clean an she wont
drink a drop o nothin If she was treated kind shed be cheerfler
Shes got a round fice an light air an eyes Er airs curly
Praps yerd like er

Take me to see her

Shed look better tomorrow cautiously when the swellins gone
down round er eye

Dart startedand it was because he had for the last five minutes
forgotten something

I shall not be here tomorrow he said His grasp upon the thing in
his pocket had loosened and he tightened it

I have some more money in my purse he said deliberately I meant to
give it away before going I want to give it to people who need it very
much

She gave him one of the sly squinting glances

Deservin cases She put it to him in brazen mockery

I dont care he answered slowly and heavily I dont care a damn

Her face changed exactly as he had seen it change on the bridge when she
had drawn nearer to him Its ugly hardness suddenly looked human And
that she could look human was fantastic

Ow much ave yer she asked Ow much is it

About ten pounds

She stopped and stared at him with open mouth

Gawd she broke out ten pounds d send Apple Blossom Court to
eving Leastways itd take some of it out o ell

Take me to it he said roughly Take me

She began to walk quickly breathing fast The fog was lighter and it
was no longer a blinding thing

A question occurred to Dart

Why dont you ask me to give the money to you he said bluntly

Dunno she answered as bluntly But after taking a few steps farther
she spoke again

I m cheerfler than most of em she elaborated If yer born
cheerfle yer can stand things When I gets a job nussin womens bibies
they dont cry when I andles em I gets many a bite an a copper cos
o that Folks likes yer I shall get on better than Polly when Im
old enough to go on the street

The organ of whose lagging sick pumpings Antony Dart had scarcely been
aware for months gave a sudden leap in his breast His blood actually
hastened its pace and ran through his veins instead of crawlinga
distinct physical effect of an actual mental condition It was produced
upon him by the mere matteroffact ordinariness of her tone He had
never been a sentimental man and had long ceased to be a feeling one
but at that moment something emotional and normal happened to him

You expect to live in that way he said

Aint nothin else fer me to do Wisht I was better lookin But Ive
got a lot of air clawing her mop an its red One day
chuckling a gent ses to mehe ses Oh yerll do Yer an ugly
little devilbut ye ARE a devil

She was leading him through a narrow filthy back street and she
stopped grinning up in his face

I say mister she wheedled lets stop at the cawfeestand Its up
this way

When he acceded and followed her she quickly turned a corner They were
in another lane thick with fog which flared with the flame of torches
stuck in costers barrows which stood here and therebarrows with
fried fish upon them barrows with secondhandlooking vegetables and
others piled with more than secondhandlooking garments Trade was not
driving but near one or two of them dirty illused looking women a
man or so and a few children stood At a corner which led into a black
hole of a court a coffeestand was stationed in charge of a burly
ruffian in corduroys

Come along said the girl There it is It aint strong but its
ot

She sidled up to the stand drawing Dart with her as if glad of his
protection

Ello Barney she said Eres a gent warnts a mug o yer best
Ive ad a bit o luck an I wants one mesself

Garn growled Barney You an yer luck Gent may want a mug but
yd show yer money fust

Strewth Ive got it Y aint got the chinge fer wot I ave in me
and ere As e mister

Show it taunted the man and then turning to Dart Yer wants a mug
o cawfee

Yes

The girl held out her hand cautiouslythe piece of gold lying upon its
palm

Look ere she said

There were two or three men slouching about the stand Suddenly a hand
darted from between two of them who stood nearest the sovereign was
snatched a screamed oath from the girl rent the thick air and a
forlorn enough scarecrow of a young fellow sprang away

The blood leaped in Antony Darts veins again and he sprang after him in
a wholly normal passion of indignation A thousand years agoas it
seemed to himhe had been a good runner This man was not one and
want of food had weakened him Dart went after him with strides which
astonished himself Up the street into an alley and out of it a dozen
yards more and into a court and the man wheeled with a hoarse baffled
curse The place had no outlet

Hell was all the creature said

Dart took him by his greasy collar Even the brief rush had left him
feeling like a living thingwhich was a new sensation

Give it up he ordered

The thief looked at him with a halflaugh and obeyed as if he felt the
uselessness of a struggle He was not more than twentyfive years old
and his eyes were cavernous with want He had the face of a man who
might have belonged to a better class When he had uttered the
exclamation invoking the infernal regions he had not dropped the
aspirate

I m as hungry as she is he raved

Hungry enough to rob a child beggar said Dart

Hungry enough to rob a starving old womanor a baby with a defiant
snort Wolf hungrytiger hungryhungry enough to cut throats

He whirled himself loose and leaned his body against the wall turning
his face toward it Suddenly he made a choking sound and began to sob

Hell he choked Ill give it up Ill give it up

What a figurewhat a figure as he swung against the blackened wall
his scarecrow clothes hanging on him their once decent material making
their pinning together of buttonless places their looseness and rents
showing dirty linen more abject than any other squalor could have made
them Antony Darts blood still running warm and well was doing its
normal work among the braincells which had stirred so evilly through
the night When he had seized the fellow by the collar his hand had
left his pocket He thrust it into another pocket and drew out some
silver

Go and get yourself some food he said As much as you can eat Then
go and wait for me at the place they call Apple Blossom Court I dont
know where it is but I am going there I want to hear how you came to
this Will you come

The thief lurched away from the wall and toward him He stared up into
his eyes through the fog The tears had smeared his cheekbones

God he said Will I come Look and see if Ill come Dart looked

Yes youll come he answered and he gave him the money I m
going back to the coffeestand

The thief stood staring after him as he went out of the court Dart was
speaking to himself

I dont know why I did it he said But the thing had to be done

In the street he turned into he came upon the robbed girl running
panting and crying She uttered a shout and flung herself upon him
clutching his coat

Gawd she sobbed hysterically I thort Id lost yer I thort Id
lost all of it I did Strewth I m glad Ive found yer and she
stopped choking with her sobs and sniffs rubbing her face in her sack

Here is your sovereign Dart said handing it to her

She dropped the corner of the sack and looked up with a queer laugh

Did yer find a copper Did yer give him in charge

No answered Dart He was worse off than you He was starving I
took this from him but I gave him some money and told him to meet us at
Apple Blossom Court

She stopped short and drew back a pace to stare up at him

Well she gave forth y ARE a queer one

And yet in the amazement on her face he perceived a remote dawning of an
understanding of the meaning of the thing he had done

He had spoken like a man in a dream He felt like a man in a dream
being led in the thick mist from place to place He was led back to the
coffeestand where now Barney the proprietor was pouring out coffee
for a hoarsevoiced coster girl with a draggled feather in her hat who
greeted their arrival hilariously

Hello Glad she cried out Got yer suvrink back

Gladit seemed to be the creatures wild namenodded but held close
to her companions side clutching his coat

Lets go in there an change it she said nodding toward a small pork
and ham shop near by An then yer can take care of it for me

What did she call you Antony Dart asked her as they went

Glad Dont know as I ever ad a nime o me own but a little cove as
went once to the pantermine told me about a young lady as was Fairy
Queen an er name was Gladys Beverly St John so I called mesself
that No one never said it all at onctthey dont never say nothin
but Glad Im glad enough this mornin chuckling again avin the
luck to come up with you mister Never had luck like it afore

They went into the pork and ham shop and changed the sovereign There
was cooked food in the windowsroast pork and boiled ham and corned
beef She bought slices of pork and beef and of suetpudding with a
few currants sprinkled through it

Will yer elp me to carry it she inquired Ill ave to get a few
penworth o coal an wood an a screw o tea an sugar My wig wot a
feed me an Pollyll ave

As they returned to the coffeestand she broke more than once into a
hop of glee Barney had changed his mind concerning her A solid
sovereign which must be changed and a companion whose shabby gentility
was absolute grandeur when compared with his present surroundings made a
difference

She received her mug of coffee and thick slice of bread and dripping
with a grin and swallowed the hot sweet liquid down in ecstatic gulps

Aint I in luck she said handing her mug back when it was empty
Gi me another Barney

Antony Dart drank coffee also and ate bread and dripping The coffee
was hot and the bread and dripping dashed with salt quite eatable He
had needed food and felt the better for it

Come on mister said Glad when their meal was ended I want to get
back to Polly an theres coal and bread and things to buy

She hurried him along breaking her pace with hops at intervals She
darted into dirty shops and brought out things screwed up in paper She
went last into a cellar and returned carrying a small sack of coal over
her shoulders

Bought sack an all she said elatedly A sacks a good thing to
ave

Let me carry it for you said Antony Dart

Spile yer coat with her sidelong upward glance

I dont care he answered I dont care a damn

The final expletive was totally unnecessary but it meant a thing he did
not say Whatsoever was thrusting him this way and that speaking
through his speech leading him to do things he had not dreamed of
doing should have its will with him He had been fastened to the skirts
of this beggar imp and he would go on to the end and do what was to be
done this day It was part of the dream

The sack of coal was over his shoulder when they turned into Apple
Blossom Court It would have been a black hole on a sunny day and now
it was like Hades lit grimly by a gasjet or two small and flickering
with the orange haze about them Filthy flagging murky doorways
broken steps and broken windows stuffed with rags and the smell of the
sewers let loose had Apple Blossom Court

Glad with the wealth of the pork and ham shop and other riches in her
arms entered a repellent doorway in a spirit of great good cheer and
Dart followed her Past a room where a drunken woman lay sleeping with
her head on a table a child pulling at her dress and crying up a
stairway with broken balusters and breaking steps through a landing
upstairs again and up still farther until they reached the top Glad
stopped before a door and shook the handle crying out

S only me Polly You can open it She added to Dart in an
undertone She as to keep it locked No knowin whod want to get in
Polly shaking the doorhandle again Pollys only me

The door opened slowly On the other side of it stood a girl with a
dimpled round face which was quite pale under one of her childishly
vacant blue eyes was a discoloration and her curly fair hair was tucked
up on the top of her head in a knot As she took in the fact of Antony
Darts presence her chin began to quiver

I aint fit toto see no one she stammered pitifully Why did you
Gladwhy did you

Aint no arm in IM said Glad Es one o the friendly ones E
give me a suvrink Look wot Ive got hopping about as she showed her
parcels

You need not be afraid of me Antony Dart said He paused a second
staring at her and suddenly added Poor little wretch

Her look was so scared and uncertain a thing that he walked away from
her and threw the sack of coal on the hearth A small grate with broken
bars hung loosely in the fireplace a battered tin kettle tilted
drunkenly near it A mattress from the holes in whose ticking straw
bulged lay on the floor in a corner with some old sacks thrown over
it Glad had without doubt borrowed her shoulder covering from the
collection The garret was as cold as the grave and almost as dark
the fog hung in it thickly There were crevices enough through which it
could penetrate

Antony Dart knelt down on the hearth and drew matches from his pocket

We ought to have brought some paper he said

Glad ran forward

Wot a gent ye are she cried Y aint never goin to light it

Yes

She ran back to the rickety table and collected the scraps of paper
which had held her purchases They were small but useful

That wot was round the sausage an the puddins greasy she exulted

Polly hung over the table and trembled at the sight of meat and bread
Plainly she did not understand what was happening The greased paper
set light to the wood and the wood to the coal All three flared and
blazed with a sound of cheerful crackling The blaze threw out its glow
as finely as if it had been set alight to warm a better place The
wonder of a fire is like the wonder of a soul This one changed the
murk and gloom to brightness and the deadly damp and cold to warmth
It drew the girl Polly from the table despite her fears She turned
involuntarily made two steps toward it and stood gazing while its
light played on her face Glad whirled and ran to the hearth

Yeve put on a lot she cried but oh my Gawd dont it warm yer
Come on Pollycome on

She dragged out a wooden stool an empty soapbox and bundled the sacks
into a heap to be sat upon She swept the things from the table and set
them in their paper wrappings on the floor

Lets all sit down close to itclose she said an get warm an
eat an eat

She was the leaven which leavened the lump of their humanity What this
leaven iswho has found out But shelittle rat of the gutterwas
formed of it and her mere pure animal joy in the temporary animal
comfort of the moment stirred and uplifted them from their depths

III

They drew near and sat upon the substitutes for seats in a circleand
the fire threw up flame and made a glow in the fog hanging in the black
hole of a room

It was Glad who set the battered kettle on and when it boiled made tea
The other two watched her being under her spell She handed out slices
of bread and sausage and pudding on bits of paper Polly fed with
tremulous haste Glad herself with rejoicing and exulting in flavors
Antony Dart ate bread and meat as he had eaten the bread and dripping at
the stallaccepting his normal hunger as part of the dream

Suddenly Glad paused in the midst of a huge bite

Mister she said praps that coves waitin fer yer Lets ave im
in Ill go and fetch im

She was getting up but Dart was on his feet first

I must go he said He is expecting me and

Aw said Glad lemme go along o yer misterjest to show theres no
ill feelin

Very well he answered

It was she who led and he who followed At the door she stopped and
looked round with a grin

Keep up the fire Polly she threw back Aint it warm and cheerful
Itll do the cove good to see it

She led the way down the black unsafe stairway She always led

Outside the fog had thickened again but she went through it as if she
could see her way

At the entrance to the court the thief was standing leaning against the
wall with fevered unhopeful waiting in his eyes He moved miserably
when he saw the girl and she called out to reassure him

I aint up to no arm she said I ony come with the gent

Antony Dart spoke to him

Did you get food

The man shook his head

I turned faint after you left me and when I came to I was afraid I
might miss you he answered I darent lose my chance I bought some
bread and stuffed it in my pocket Ive been eating it while Ive stood
here

Come back with us said Dart We are in a place where we have some
food

He spoke mechanically and was aware that he did so He was a pawn
pushed about upon the board of this days life

Come on said the girl Yer can get enough to last fer three days

She guided them back through the fog until they entered the murky
doorway again Then she almost ran up the staircase to the room they
had left

When the door opened the thief fell back a pace as before an
unexpected thing It was the flare of firelight which struck upon his
eyes He passed his hand over them

A fire he said I havent seen one for a week Coming out of the
blackness it gives a man a start

Improvident joy gleamed in Glads eyes

Well be warm onct she chuckled if we aint never warm agaen

She drew her circle about the hearth again The thief took the place
next to her and she handed out food to hima big slice of meat bread
a thick slice of pudding

Fill yerself up she said Then yell feel like yer can talk

The man tried to eat his food with decorum some recollection of the
habits of better days restraining him but starved nature was too much
for him His hands shook his eyes filled his teeth tore The rest of
the circle tried not to look at him Glad and Polly occupied themselves
with their own food

Antony Dart gazed at the fire Here he sat warming himself in a loft
with a beggar a thief and a helpless thing of the street He had come
out to buy a pistolits weight still hung in his overcoat pocketand
he had reached this place of whose existence he had an hour ago not
dreamed Each step which had led him had seemed a simple inevitable
thing for which he had apparently been responsible but which he knew
yes somehow he KNEWhe had of his own volition neither planned nor
meant Yet here he sata part of the lives of the beggar the thief
and the poor thing of the street What did it mean

Tell me he said to the thief how you came here

By this time the young fellow had fed himself and looked less like a
wolf It was to be seen now that he had bluegray eyes which were
dreamy and young

I have always been inventing things he said a little huskily I did
it when I was a child I always seemed to see there might be a way of
doing a thing bettergetting more power When other boys were playing
games I was sitting in corners trying to build models out of wire and
string and old boxes and tin cans I often thought I saw the way to
things but I was always too poor to get what was needed to work them
out Twice I heard of men making great names and for tunes because they
had been able to finish what I could have finished if I had had a few
pounds It used to drive me mad and break my heart His hands clenched
themselves and his huskiness grew thicker There was a man catching
his breath who leaped to the top of the ladder and set the whole world
talking and writingand I had done the thing FIRSTI swear I had It
was all clear in my brain and I was half mad with joy over it but I
could not afford to work it out He could so to the end of time it
will be HIS He struck his fist upon his knee

Aw The deep little drawl was a groan from Glad

I got a place in an office at last I worked hard and they began to
trust me Ihad a new idea It was a big one I needed money to work
it out II remembered what had happened before I felt like a poor
fellow running a race for his life I KNEW I could pay back ten times
a hundred timeswhat I took

You took money said Dart

The thiefs head dropped

No I was caught when I was taking it I wasnt sharp enough Someone
came in and saw me and there was a crazy row I was sent to prison
There was no more trying after that Its nearly two years since and
Ive been hanging about the streets and falling lower and lower Ive
run miles panting after cabs with luggage in them and not had strength
to carry in the boxes when they stopped Ive starved and slept out of
doors But the thing I wanted to work out is in my mind all the time
like some machine tearing round It wants to be finished It never
will be Thats all

Glad was leaning forward staring at him her roughened hands with the
smeared cracks on them clasped round her knees

Things AS to be finished she said They finish theirselves

How do you know Dart turned on her

Dunno OW I knowbut I do When things begin they finish Its like a
wheel rollin down an ill Her sharp eyes fixed themselves on Darts
All of usll finish somethincos weve begun You willPolly
wille willI will She stopped with a sudden sheepish chuckle and
dropped her forehead on her knees giggling Dunno wot I m talking
about she said but its true

Dart began to understand that it was And he also saw that this ragged
thing who knew nothing whatever looked out on the world with the eyes
of a seer though she was ignorant of the meaning of her own knowledge
It was a weird thing He turned to the girl Polly

Tell me how you came here he said

He spoke in a low voice and gently He did not want to frighten her
but he wanted to know how SHE had begun When she lifted her childish
eyes to his her chin began to shake For some reason she did not
question his right to ask what he would She answered him meekly as
her fingers fumbled with the stuff of her dress

I lived in the country with my mother she said We was very happy
together In the spring there was primroses andand lambs Icant
abide to look at the sheep in the park these days They remind me so
There was a girl in the village got a place in town and came back and
told us all about it It made me silly I wanted to come here too
II came She put her arm over her face and began to sob

She cant tell you said Glad There was a swell in the ouse made
love to her She used to carry up coals to is parlor an e talked to
er E ad a wye with im

Polly broke into a smothered wail

Oh I did love him soI did she cried Id have let him walk over
me Id have let him kill me

E nearly did it said Glad

E went away sudden an shes never eard word of im since

From under Pollys facehiding arm came broken words

I couldnt tell my mother I did not know how I was too frightened
and ashamed Now its too late I shall never see my mother again and
it seems as if all the lambs and primroses in the world was dead Oh
theyre deadtheyre deadand I wish I was too

Glads eyes winked rapidly and she gave a hoarse little cough to clear
her throat Her arms still clasping her knees she hitched herself
closer to the girl and gave her a nudge with her elbow

Buck up Polly she said we aint none of us finished yet Look at
us nowsittin by our own fire with bread and puddin inside usan
think wot we was this mornin Who knows wot well ave this time
tomorrer

Then she stopped and looked with a wide grin at Antony Dart

Ow did I come ere she said

Yes he answered how did you come here

I dunno she said I was ere first thing I remember I lived with a
old woman in another ouse in the court One mornin when I woke up she
was dead Sometimes Ive begged an sold matches Sometimes Ive took
care of womens children or elped em when they ad to lie up Ive
seen a lotbut I like to see a lot Ope Ill see a lot more afore Im
done Im used to bein ungry an cold an all that butbut I
allers like to see whats comin tomorrer Theres allers somethin
else tomorrer Thats all about ME and she chuckled again

Dart picked up some fresh sticks and threw them on the fire There was
some fine crackling and a new flame leaped up

If you could do what you liked he said what would you like to do

Her chuckle became an outright laugh

If I ad ten pounds she asked evidently prepared to adjust herself
in imagination to any form of unlookedfor good luck

If you had more

His tone made the thief lift his head to look at him

If I ad a wand like the one Jem told me was in the pantermine

Yes he answered

She sat and stared at the fire a few moments and then began to speak in
a low luxuriating voice

Id get a better room she said revelling Theres one in the next
ouse Id ave a few sticks o furnisher in ita bed an a chair or
two Id get some warm petticuts an a shawl an a atwith a ostrich
feather in it Polly an me d live together Wed ave fire an grub
every day Id get drunken Bets biby put in an ome Id elp the
women when they ad to lie up IdId elp IM a bit with a jerk of
her elbow toward the thief If e was kept fed praps e could work
out that thing in is ead Id go round the court an elp them with
usbands that knocks em about IdId put a stop to the knockin
about a queer fixed look showing itself in her eyes If I ad money
I could do it Ow much with sudden prudence could a body ave
with one o them wands

More than enough to do all you have spoken of answered Dart

Its a shime a body couldnt ave it Apple Blossom Court d be a
different thing Itd be the sime as Miss Montaubyn says its goin to
be She laughed again this time as if remembering something
fantastic but not despicable

Who is Miss Montaubyn

Shes a old woman as lives next floor below When she was young she
was pretty an used to dance in the alls Drunken Bet says she was one
o the wust When she got old it made er mad an she got wusser She
was ready to tear gals eyes out an when shed get took for makin a
row shed fight like a tiger cat About a year ago she tumbled
downstairs when shed ad too much an she broke both er legs You
remember Polly

Polly hid her face in her hands

Oh when they took her away to the hospital she shuddered Oh when
they lifted her up to carry her

I thought Polly d ave a fit when she eard er screamin an
swearin My it was langwich But it was the orspitle did it

Did what

Dunno with an uncertain even slightly awed laugh Dunno wot it
didneither does nobody else but somethin appened It was along of
a lidy as come in one day an talked to er when she was lyin there
My eye chuckling it was queer talk But I liked it Praps it was
lies but it was cheerfle lies that elps yer What I ses isif THINGS
aint cheerfle PEOPLEs got to beto fight it out The women in the
ouse larft fit to kill theirselves when she fust come ome limpin an
talked to em about what the lidy told er But arter a bit they liked
to ear erjust along o the cheerfleness Said it was like a
pantermine Drunken Bet says if she could get old f it an believe it
sime as Jinny Montaubyn does itd be as cheerin as drink an last
longer

Is it a kind of religion Dart asked having a vague memory of rumors
of fantastic new theories and halfborn beliefs which had seemed to him
weird visions floating through fagged brains wearied by old doubts and
arguments and failures The world was tiredthe whole earth was sad
centuries had wrought only to the end of this twentieth centurys
despair Was the struggle waking even herein this back water of the
huge citys human tide he wondered with dull interest

Is it a kind of religion he said

Its cheerfler Glad thrust out her sharp chin uncertainly again
Theres no ell fire in it An there aint no blime laid on
Godamighty The word as she uttered it seemed to have no connection
whatever with her usual colloquial invocation of the Deity When a
dray run over little Billy an crushed im inter a rag an is mother
was screamin an draggin er air down the curick e ses Its
Gawds will e sesan e aint no bad sort neither an is fice was
white an wet with sweatGawd done it e ses An me Id nussed the
child an I clawed me air sime as if I was is mother an I screamed
out Then damn im An the curick e dropped sittin down on the
curbstone an id is fice in is ands

Dart hid his own face after the manner of the wretched curate

No wonder he groaned His blood turned cold

But said Glad Miss Montaubyns lidy she says Godamighty never done
it nor never intended it an if we kep sayin an believin es
close to us an not millyuns o miles away wed be took care of whilst
we was alive an not ave to wait till we was dead

She got up on her feet and threw up her arms with a sudden jerk and
involuntary gesture

I m alive I m alive she cried out Ive got ter be took care of
NOW Thats why I like wot she tells about it So does the women We
aint no more reason ter be sure of wot the curick says than ter be sure
o this Dunno as Ive got ter choose either way but if I ad Id
choose the cheerflest

Dart had sat staring at herso had Pollyso had the thief Dart
rubbed his forehead

I do not understand he said

T aint understanding Its believin Bless yer SHE doesnt
understand I say lets go an talk to er a bit She dont mind
nothin an shell let us in We can leave Polly an im ere They
can make some more tea an drink it

It ended in their going out of the room together again and stumbling
once more down the stairways crookedness At the bottom of the first
short flight they stopped in the darkness and Glad knocked at a door
with a summons manifestly expectant of cheerful welcome She used the
formula she had used before

S ony me Miss Montaubyn she cried out S ony Glad

The door opened in wide welcome and confronting them as she held its
handle stood a small old woman with an astonishing face It was
astonishing because while it was withered and wrinkled with marks of
past years which had once stamped their reckless unsavoriness upon its
every line some strange redeeming thing had happened to it and its
expression was that of a creature to whom the opening of a door could
only mean the entrancethe tumbling in as it wereof hopes realized
Its surface was swept clean of even the vaguest anticipation of anything
not to be desired Smiling as it did through the black doorway into the
unrelieved shadow of the passage it struck Antony Dart at once that it
actually implied thisand that in this placeand indeed in any
placenothing could have been more astonishing What could indeed

Well well she said come in Glad bless yer

Ive brought a gent to ear yer talk a bit Glad explained informally

The small old woman raised her twinkling old face to look at him

Ah she said as if summing up what was before her E thinks its
worse than it is doesnt e now Come in sir do

This time it struck Dart that her look seemed actually to anticipate the
evolving of some wonderful and desirable thing from himself As if even
his gloom carried with it treasure as yet undisplayed As she knew
nothing of the ten sovereigns he wondered what in Gods name she saw

The poverty of the little square room had an odd cheer in it Much
scrubbing had removed from it the objections manifest in Glads room
above There was a small red fire in the grate a strip of old but gay
carpet before it two chairs and a table were covered with a harlequin
patchwork made of bright odds and ends of all sizes and shapes The fog
in all its murky volume could not quite obscure the brightness of the
often rubbed window and its harlequin curtain drawn across upon a
string

Bless yer said Miss Montaubyn sit down

Dart sat and thanked her Glad dropped upon the floor and girdled her
knees comfortably while Miss Montaubyn took the second chair which was
close to the table and snuffed the candle which stood near a basket of
colored scraps such as without doubt had made the harlequin curtain

Yer wont mind me goin on with me bit o work she chirped

Tell im wot it is Glad suggested

They come from a dressmaker as is in a small way designating the
scraps by a gesture I clean up for er an she lets me ave em I
make em up into anythink I canpincushions an bags an curtings an
balls Nobodyd think wot they run to sometimes Now an then I sell
some of em Wot I cant sell I give away

Drunken Bets biby plays with er ball all day said Glad

Ah said Miss Montaubyn drawing out a long needleful of thread Bet
SHE thinks it worse than it is

Could it be worse asked Dart Could anything be worse than
everything is

Lots suggested Glad might ave broke your back might ave a fever
might be in jail for knifin someone E wants to ear you talk Miss
Montaubyn tell im all about yerself

Me her expectant eyes on him E wouldnt want to ear it I
shouldnt want to ear it myself Bein on the alls when yer a pretty
girl aint an elpful life an bein took up an dropped down till yer
dropped in the gutter an dont know ow to get outits wot yer
mustnt let yer mind go back to

Thats wot the lidy said called out Glad Tell im about the lidy
She doesnt even know who she was The remark was tossed to Dart

Never even eard er name with unabated cheer said Miss Montaubyn
She come an she went an me too low to do anything but lie an look at
er and listen An Which of us two is mad I ses to myself But I
lay thinkin and thinkinan it was so cheerfle I couldnt get it out
of me eadnor never ave since

What did she say

I couldnt remember the wordsit was the way they took away things a
bodys afraid of It was about things never avin really been like
wot we thought they was Godamighty now there aint a bit of arm in
im

What he said with a start

E never done the accidents and the trouble It was us as went out of
the light into the dark If wed kep in the light all the time an
thought about it an talked about it wed never ad nothin else
Taint punishment neither T aint nothin but the darkan the dark
aint nothin but the light bein away Keep in the light she ses
never think of nothin else an then youll begin an see things
Everybodys been afraid There aint no need You believe THAT

Believe said Dart heavily

She nodded

Yes ses I to er thats where the trouble comes inbelievin
And she answers as cool as could be Yes it is she ses weve all
been thinkin weve been believin an none of us as If we ad what
d there be to be afraid of If we believed a king was givin us our
livin an takin care of us whod be afraid of not avin enough to
eat

Who groaned Dart He sat hanging his head and staring at the floor
This was another phase of the dream

Where is E I ses Im as breaks old womens legs an crushes
babies under wheelsso as theyll be resigned An all of a sudden
she calls out quite loud Nowhere she ses An never was But Im
as stretched forth the eavens an laid the foundations of the earth
Im as is the Life an Love of the world Es ERE Stretch out yer
and she ses an call out Speak Lord thy servant eareth an
yell ear an SEE

An never you stop sayin itlet yer eart beat it an yer breath
breathe itan yer ll find yer goin about laughin soft to yerself
an lovin everythin as if it was yer own child at breast An no arm
can come to yer Try it when yer go ome

Did you asked Dart

Glad answered for her with a tremulousyes it was a TREMULOUSgiggle
a weirdly moved little sound

When she wakes in the mornin she ses to erself Good things is goin
to come todaycheerfle things When theres a knock at the door she
ses Somethin friendlys comin in An when Drunken Bets makin a
row an ragin an tearin an threatenin to ave er eyes out of er
fice she ses Lor Bet yer dont mean a word of ityer a friend to
every woman in the ouse When she dont know which way to turn she
stands still an ses Speak Lord thy servant eareth an then she
does wotever next comes into er mindan she says its allus the
right answer Sometimes sheepishly Ive tried it myselfpraps its
true I did it this mornin when I sat down an pulled me sack over me
ead on the bridge Polly d been cryin so loud all night Id got a
bit low in me stummick an She stopped suddenly and turned on Dart
as if light had flashed across her mind Dunno nothin about it she
stammered but I SAID itjust like she doesan YOU come

Plainly she had uttered whatever words she had used in the form of a
sort of incantation and here was the result in the living body of this
man sitting before her She stared hard at him repeating her words
YOU come Yes you did

It was the answer said Miss Montaubyn with entire simplicity as she
bit off her thread thats wot it was

Antony Dart lifted his heavy head

You believe it he said

I m livin on believin it she said confidingly I aint got
nothin else An answers keeps comin and comin

What answers

Bits o workan things as elps Glad there shes one

Aw said Glad I aint nothin I likes to ear yer tell about it
She ses to Dart again a little slowly as she watched his face with
curiously questioning eyesshe ses ES in the roomsame as Es
everywherein this ere room Sometimes she talks out loud to Im

What cried Dart startled again

The strange Majestic Awful Ideathe Deity of the Agesto be spoken of
as a mere unfeared Reality And even as the vaguely formed thought
sprang in his brain he started once more suddenly confronted by the
meaning his sense of shock implied What had all the sermons of all the
centuries been preaching but that it was Reality What had all the
infidels of every age contended but that it was Unreal and the folly of
a dream He had never thought of himself as an infidel perhaps it
would have shocked him to be called one though he was not quite sure
But that a little superannuated dancer at musichalls battered and worn
by an unlawful life should sit and smile in absolute faith at such aa
superstition as this stirred something like awe in him

For she was smiling in entire acquiescence

Its what the curick ses she enlarged radiantly Though e don t
believe it pore young man e ony thinks e does Its for igh an
low e ses for you an me as well as for them as is royal fambleys
The Almighty Es EVERYWHERE Yes ses I Ive felt Im ereas
near as y are yerself sir I avean Ive spoke to Im

What did the curate say Dart asked amazed

Seemed like it frightened im a bit We mustnt be too bold Miss
Montaubyn my dear e ses for es a kind young man as ever lived
an often ses my dear to them es comfortin But yer see the lidy
ad gave me a Bible o me own an Id set ere an read it an read it
an learned verses to say to meself when I was in bedan Id got ter
feel like it was someone talkin to me an makin me understand So I
ses T aint boldness were warned against its not lovin an
trustin enough an not askin an believin TRUE Dont yer remember
wot it ses I even I am e that comforteth yer Who art thou that
thou art afraid of man that shall die an the son of man that shall be

Am I sitting here listening to an old female reprobates disquisition
on religion passed through Antony Darts mind Why am I listening I
am doing it because here is a creature who BELIEVESknowing no
doctrine knowing no church She BELIEVESshe thinks she KNOWS her
Deity is by her side She is not afraid To her simpleness the awful
Unknown is the Knownand WITH her

Suppose it were true he uttered aloud in response to a sense of
inward tremor supposeitwereTRUE And he was not speaking
either to the woman or the girl and his forehead was damp

Gawd said Glad her chin almost on her knees her eyes staring
fearsomely Spose it wasan us sittin ere an not knowin itan
no one knowin itnor gettin the good of it Sime as if pondering
hard in search of simile sime as if no one ad never knowed about
lectricity an there wasnt no lectric lights nor no lectric
nothin Onct nobody knowed an all the sime it was therejest
waitin

Her fantastic laugh ended for her with a little choking vaguely
hysteric sound

Blimme she said Aint it queer us not knowinIF ITS TRUE

Antony Dart bent forward in his chair He looked far into the eyes of
the exdancer as if some unseen thing within them might answer him
Miss Montaubyn herself for the moment he did not see

What he stammered hoarsely his voice broken with awe what of the
hideous wrongsthe woes and horrorsand hideous wrongs

There wouldnt be none if WE was rightif we never thought nothin but
Goods comingood s ere If we everyone of us thought itevery
minit of every day

She did not know she was speaking of a millenniumthe end of the world
She sat by her one candle threading her needle and believing she was
speaking of Today

He laughed a hollow laugh

If we were right he said It would take longlonglongto make
us all so

It would be slow praps Well so it wouldbut good comes quick for
them as begins callin it Its been quick for ME drawing her thread
through the needles eye triumphantly Lor yes me legs is better
me lucks betterpeoples better Bless yer yes

Its true said Glad she gets on somehow Things comes She never
wants no drink Me now she applied to Miss Montaubyn if I took it
up same as youwotd come to a gal like me

Wot ud yer want ter come Dart saw that in her mind was an absolute
lack of any premonition of obstacle Wotd yer arst fer in yer own
mind

Glad reflected profoundly

Polly she said she wants to go ome to er mother an to the
country I aint got no mother an wot I ear of the country seems like
Id get tired of it Nothin but quiet an lambs an birds an things
growin Me I likes things goin on I likes people an and organs
an buses Id stay eresame as I told YOU with a jerk of her hand
toward Dart An do things in the courtif I ad a bit o money I
dont want to live no gay life when I m a woman Its too ard Us
pore uns ends too bad Wisht I knowed I could get on some ow

Good ll come said Miss Montaubyn Just you say the same as me
every morninGoods fillin the world an some of its comin to me
Its bein sentan I m goin to meet it Its cominits
comin She bent forward and touched the girls shoulder with her
astonishing eyes alight Bless yer wots in my rooms in yours Lor
yes

Glads eyes stared into hers they became mysteriously almost
awesomely astonishing also

Is it she breathed in a hushed voice

Yes Lor yes When yer get up in the mornin you just stand still
an ARST it Speak Lord ses you speak Lord

Thy servant eareth ended Glads hushed speech Blimme but I m
goin to try it

Perhaps the brain of her saw it still as an incantation perhaps the
soul of her called up strangely out of the dark and still newborn and
blind and vague saw it vaguely and half blindly as something else

Dart was wondering which of these things were true

Weve never been expectin nothin thats good said Miss Montaubyn
We re allus expectin the other Who isnt I was allus expectin
rheumatiz an unger an cold an starvin old age Wot was you lookin
for to Dart

He looked down on the floor and answered heavily

Failing brainfailing lifedespairdeath

None of ems cominif yer dont call em Stand still an listen
for the other Its the other thats TRUE

She was without doubt amazing She chirped like a bird singing on a
bough rejoicing in token of the shining of the sun

Its wot yer can work onthis said Glad The curickes a good
sort an no arm in imbut e ses Trouble an unger is ter teach
yer ter submit Accidents an coughs as tears yer lungs is sent you to
prepare yer for eaven If yer loves Im as sends em yer ll go
there Ave yer ever bin ses I Ave yer ever saw anyone thats

ses Dont me girl dont Garn I ses tell me somethin as ll
do me some good afore Im dead Eavens too far off

The kingdom of eaven is at and said Miss Montaubyn Bless yer
yes just ere

Antony Dart glanced round the room It was a strange place But
something WAS here Magic was it Frenzydreamswhat

He heard from below a sudden murmur and crying out in the street Miss
Montaubyn heard it and stopped in her sewing holding her needle and
thread extended

Glad heard it and sprang to her feet

Somethins appened she cried out Someones urt

She was out of the room in a breaths space She stood outside
listening a few seconds and darted back to the open door speaking
through it They could hear below commotion exclamations the wail of
a child

Somethins appened to Bet she cried out again I can ear the
child

She was gone and flying down the staircase Antony Dart and Miss
Montaubyn rose together The tumult was increasing people were running
about in the court and it was plain a crowd was forming by the magic
which calls up crowds as from nowhere about the door The childs
screams rose shrill above the noise It was no small thing which had
occurred

I must go said Miss Montaubyn limping away from her table Praps
I can elp Praps you can elp too as he followed her

They were met by Glad at the threshold She had shot back to them
panting

She was blind drunk she said an she went out to get more She
tried to cross the street an fell under a car Shell be dead in five
minits Im goin for the biby

Dart saw Miss Montaubyn step back into her room He turned
involuntarily to look at her

She stood still a secondso still that it seemed as if she was not
drawing mortal breath Her astonishing expectant eyes closed
themselves and yet in closing spoke expectancy still

Speak Lord she said softly but as if she spoke to Something whose
nearness to her was such that her hand might have touched it Speak
Lord thy servant eareth

Antony Dart almost felt his hair rise He quaked as she came near her
poor clothes brushing against him He drew back to let her pass first
and followed her leading

The court was filled with men women and children who surged about the
doorway talking crying and protesting against each others crowding
Dart caught a glimpse of a policeman fighting his way through with a
doctor A dishevelled woman with a child at her dirty bare breast had
got in and was talking loudly

Just outside the court it was she proclaimed an I saw it If
shed bin erself it couldnt ave appened No time for osspitles
ses I Shes not twenty breaths to dror let er die in er own bed
pore thing And both she and her baby breaking into wails at one and
the same time other women some hysteric some maudlin with gin joined
them in a terrified outburst

Get out you women commanded the doctor who had forced his way
across the threshold Send them away officer to the policeman

There were others to turn out of the room itself which was crowded with
morbid or terrified creatures all making for confusion Glad had
seized the child and was forcing her way out into such air as there was
outside

The beda strange and loathly thingstood by the empty rusty
fireplace Drunken Bet lay on it a bundle of clothing over which the
doctor bent for but a few minutes before he turned away

Antony Dart standing near the door heard Miss Montaubyn speak to him
in a whisper

May I go to er and the doctor nodded

She limped lightly forward and her small face was white but expectant
still What could she expect nowO Lord what

An extraordinary thing happened An abnormal silence fell The owners
of such faces as on stretched necks caught sight of her seemed in a
flash to communicate with others in the crowd

Jinny Montaubyn someone whispered And Jinny Montaubyn was passed
along leaving an awed stirring in its wake Those whom the pressure
outside had crushed against the wall near the window in a passionate
hurry breathed on and rubbed the panes that they might lay their faces
to them One tore out the rags stuffed in a broken place and listened
breathlessly

Jinny Montaubyn was kneeling down and laying her small old hand on the
muddied forehead She held it there a second or so and spoke in a voice
whose low clearness brought back at once to Dart the voice in which she
had spoken to the Something upstairs

Bet she said Bet And then more soft still and yet more clear
Bet my dear

It seemed incredible but it was a fact Slowly the lids of the womans
eyes lifted and the pupils fixed themselves on Jinny Montaubyn who
leaned still closer and spoke again

T aint true she said Not this T aint TRUE There IS NO
DEATH slow and soft but passionately distinct THEREISNO
DEATH

The muscles of the womans face twisted it into a rueful smile The
three words she dragged out were so faint that perhaps none but Darts
strained ears heard them

WotpriceME

The soul of her was loosening fast and straining away but Jinny
Montaubyn followed it

THEREISNODEATH and her low voice had the tone of a slender
silver trumpet In a minit yer ll knowin a minit Lord lifting
her expectant face show her the wye

Mysteriously the clouds were clearing from the sodden facemysteriously
Miss Montaubyn watched them as they were swept away A minutetwo
minutesand they were gone Then she rose noiselessly and stood
looking down speaking quite simply as if to herself

Ah she breathed she DOES know nowfer sure an certain

Then Antony Dart turning slightly realized that a man who had entered
the house and been standing near him breathing with light quickness
since the moment Miss Montaubyn had knelt was plainly the person Glad
had called the curick and that he had bowed his head and covered his
eyes with a hand which trembled

IV

He was a young man with an eager soul and his work in Apple Blossom
Court and places like it had torn him many ways Religious conventions
established through centuries of custom had not prepared him for life
among the submerged He had struggled and been appalled he had wrestled
in prayer and felt himself unanswered and in repentance of the feeling
had scourged himself with thorns Miss Montaubyn returning from the
hospital had filled him at first with horror and protest

But who knowswho knows he said to Dart as they stood and talked
together afterward Faith as a little child That is literally hers
And I was shocked by itand tried to destroy it until I suddenly saw
what I was doing I wasin my cloddish egotismtrying to show her
that she was irreverent BECAUSE she could believe what in my soul I do
not though I dare not admit so much even to myself She took from some
strange passing visitor to her tortured bedside what was to her a
revelation She heard it first as a child hears a story of magic When
she came out of the hospital she told it as if it was one II he
bit his lips and moistened them argued with her and reproached her
Christ the Merciful forgive me She sat in her squalid little room
with her magicsometimes in the darksometimes without fire and she
clung to it and loved it and asked it to help her as a child asks its
father for bread When she was answeredand God forgive me again for
doubting that the simple good that came to her WAS an answerwhen any
small help came to her she was a radiant thing and without a shadow of
doubt in her eyes told me of it as proofproof that she had been heard
When things went wrong for a day and the fire was out again and the room
dark she said I avent kept near enoughI avent trusted TRUE It
will be gave me soon and when once at such a time I said to her We
must learn to say Thy will be done she smiled up at me like a happy
baby and answered

Thy will be done on earth AS IT IS IN EAVEN Lor theres no cold
there nor no unger nor no cryin nor pain Thats the way the will is
done in eaven Thats wot I arst for all day longfor it to be done
on earth as it is in eaven What could I say Could I tell her that
the will of the Deity on the earth he created was only the will to do
evilto give painto crush the creature made in His own image What
else do we mean when we say under all horror and agony that befalls It
is Gods willGods will be done Base unbeliever though I am I could
not speak the words Oh she has something we have not Her poor
little misspent life has changed itself into a shining thing though it
shines and glows only in this hideous place She herself does not know
of its shining But Drunken Bet would stagger up to her room and ask to
be told what she called her pantermine stories I have seen her there
sitting listeninglistening with strange quiet on her and dull yearning
in her sodden eyes So would other and worse women go to her and I
who had struggled with them could see that she had reached some remote
longing in their beings which I had never touched In time the seed
would have stirred to lifeit is beginning to stir even now During
the months since she came back to the courtthough they have laughed at
herboth men and women have begun to see her as a creature weirdly set
apart Most of them feel something like awe of her they half believe
her prayers to be bewitchments but they want them on their side They
have never wanted mine That I have knownKNOWN She believes that
her Deity is in Apple Blossom Courtin the dire holes its people live
in on the broken stairway in every nook and awful cranny of ita
great Glory we will not seeonly waiting to be called and to answer Do
_I_ believe itdo youdo any of those anointed of us who preach each
day so glibly God is EVERYWHERE Who is the one who believes If
there were such a man he would go about as Moses did when He wist not
that his face shone

They had gone out together and were standing in the fog in the court
The curate removed his hat and passed his handkerchief over his damp
forehead his breath coming and going almost sobbingly his eyes staring
straight before him into the yellowness of the haze

Who he said after a moment of singular silence who are you

Antony Dart hesitated a few seconds and at the end of his pause he put
his hand into his overcoat pocket

If you will come upstairs with me to the room where the girl Glad
lives I will tell you he said but before we go I want to hand
something over to you

The curate turned an amazed gaze upon him

What is it he asked

Dart withdrew his hand from his pocket and the pistol was in it

I came out this morning to buy this he said I intendednever mind
what I intended A wrong turn taken in the fog brought me here Take
this thing from me and keep it

The curate took the pistol and put it into his own pocket without
comment In the course of his labors he had seen desperate men and
desperate things many times He had even beenat momentsa desperate
man thinking desperate things himself though no human being had ever
suspected the fact This man had faced some tragedy he could see Had
he been on the verge of a crimehad he looked murder in the eyes What
had made him pause Was it possible that the dream of Jinny Montaubyn
being in the air had reached his brainhis being

He looked almost appealingly at him but he only said aloud

Let us go upstairs then

So they went

As they passed the door of the room where the dead woman lay Dart went
in and spoke to Miss Montaubyn who was still there

If there are things wanted here he said this will buy them And
he put some money into her hand

She did not seem surprised at the incongruity of his shabbiness
producing money

Well now she said I WAS wonderin an askin Id like er clean
an nice an theres milk wanted bad for the biby

In the room they mounted to Glad was trying to feed the child with bread
softened in tea Polly sat near her looking on with restless eager
eyes She had never seen anything of her own baby but its limp newborn
and dead body being carried away out of sight She had not even dared
to ask what was done with such poor little carrion The tyranny of the
law of life made her want to paw and touch this lately born thing as
her agony had given her no fruit of her own body to touch and paw and
nuzzle and caress as mother creatures will whether they be women or
tigresses or doves or female cats

Let me hold her Glad she half whimpered When shes fed let me
get her to sleep

All right Glad answered we could look after er between us well
enough

The thief was still sitting on the hearth but being full fed and
comfortable for the first time in many a day he had rested his head
against the wall and fallen into profound sleep

Wots up said Glad when the two men came in Is anythin
appenin

I have come up here to tell you something Dart answered Let us sit
down again round the fire It will take a little time

Glad with eager eyes on him handed the child to Polly and sat down
without a moments hesitance avid of what was to come She nudged the
thief with friendly elbow and he started up awake

Es got somethin to tell us she explained The curicks come
up to ear it too Sit ere Polly with elbow jerk toward the bundle
of sacks Its got its stummick full an itll go to sleep fast
enough

So they sat again in the weird circle Neither the strangeness of the
group nor the squalor of the hearth were of a nature to be new things to
the curate His eyes fixed themselves on Darts face as did the eyes
of the thief the beggar and the young thing of the street No one
glanced away from him

His telling of his story was almost monotonous in its semireflective
quietness of tone The strangeness to himselfthough it was a
strangeness he accepted absolutely without protestlay in his telling
it at all and in a sense of his knowledge that each of these creatures
would understand and mysteriously know what depths he had touched this
day

Just before I left my lodgings this morning he said I found myself
standing in the middle of my room and speaking to Something aloud I
did not know I was going to speak I did not know what I was speaking
to I heard my own voice cry out in agony Lord Lord what shall I do
to be saved

The curate made a sudden movement in his place and his sallow young
face flushed But he said nothing

Glads small and sharp countenance became curious

Speak Lord thy servant eareth she quoted tentatively

No answered Dart it was not like that I had never thought of such
things I believed nothing I was going out to buy a pistol and when I
returned intended to blow my brains out

Why asked Glad with passionately intent eyes why

Because I was worn out and done for and all the world seemed worn out
and done for And among other things I believed I was beginning slowly
to go mad

From the thief there burst forth a low groan and he turned his face to
the wall

Ive been there he said I m near there now

Dart took up speech again

There was no answernone As I stood waitingGod knows for whatthe
dead stillness of the room was like the dead stillness of the grave And
I went out saying to my soul This is what happens to the fool who
cries aloud in his pain

Ive cried aloud said the thief and sometimes it seemed as if an
answer was comingbut I always knew it never would in a tortured
voice

T aint fair to arst that wye Glad put in with shrewd logic

Miss Montaubyn she allers knows it WILL comean it does

Somethingnot myselfturned my feet toward this place said Dart I
was thrust from one thing to another I was forced to see and hear
things close at hand It has been as if I was under a spell The woman
in the room belowthe woman lying dead He stopped a second and then
went on There is too much that is crying out aloud A man such as I
amit has FORCED itself upon mecannot leave such things and give
himself to the dust I cannot explain clearly because I am not thinking
as I am accustomed to think A change has come upon me I shall not
use the pistolas I meant to use it

Glad made a friendly clutch at the sleeve of his shabby coat

Right O she cried Thats it You buck up sime as I told yer Y
aint stony broke an theres allers tomorrer

Antony Darts expression was weirdly retrospective

I did not think so this morning he answered

But there is said the girl Aint there now curick Theres a lot
o work in yer yet yer could do all sorts o things if y aint too
proud Ill elp yer So ll the curick Y aint found out yet what
a little folks can live on till luck turns Me Im goin to try Miss
Montaubyns wye Les both try Les believe things is comin Les
get er to talk to us some more

The curate was thinking the thing over deeply

Yer see Glad enlarged cheerfully yer look almost like a gentleman
Praps yer can write a good and an spell all right Can yer

Yes

I think perhaps the curate began reflectively particularly if you
can write well I might be able to get you some work

I do not want work Dart answered slowly At least I do not want the
kind you would be likely to offer me

The curate felt a shock as if cold water had been dashed over him
Somehow it had not once occurred to him that the man could be one of the
educated degenerate vicious for whom no power to help lay in any hands
yet he was not the common vagrantand he was plainly on the point of
producing an excuse for refusing work

The other man seeing his start and his amazed troubled flush put out
a hand and touched his arm apologetically

I beg your pardon he said One of the things I was going to tell
youI had not finishedwas that I AM what is called a gentleman I am
also what the world knows as a rich man I am Sir Oliver Holt

Each member of the party gazed at him aghast It was an enormous name
to claim Even the two female creatures knew what it stood for It was
the name which represented the greatest wealth and power in the world of
finance and schemes of business It stood for financial influence which
could change the face of national fortunes and bring about crises It
was known throughout the world Yesterday the newspaper rumor that its
owner had mysteriously left England had caused men on Change to discuss
possibilities together with lowered voices

Glad stared at the curate For the first time she looked disturbed and
alarmed

Blimme she ejaculated es gone off is nut pore chapes
gone off it

No the man answered you shall come to mehe hesitated a second
while a shade passed over his eyesTOMORROW And you shall see

He rose quietly to his feet and the curate rose also Abnormal as the
climax was it was to be seen that there was no mistake about the
revelation The man was a creature of authority and used to carrying
conviction by his unsupported word That made itself by some clear
unspoken method plain

You are Sir Oliver Holt And a few hours ago you were on the point
of

Ending it allin an obscure lodging Afterward the earth would have
been shovelled on to a workhouse coffin It was an awful thing He
shook off a passionate shudder There was no wealth on earth that could
give me a moments easesleephopelife The whole world was full
of things I loathed the sight and thought of The doctors said my
condition was physical Perhaps it wasperhaps today has strangely
given a healthful jolt to my nervesperhaps I have been dragged away
from the agony of morbidity and plunged into new intense emotions which
have saved me from the last thing and the worstSAVED me

He stopped suddenly and his face flushed and then quite slowly turned
pale

SAVED ME he repeated the words as the curate saw the awed blood
creepingly recede Who knows who knows How many explanations one is
ready to give before one thinks of what we say we believe Perhaps it
wasthe Answer

The curate bowed his head reverently

Perhaps it was

The girl Glad sat clinging to her knees her eyes wide and awed and with
a sudden gush of hysteric tears rushing down her cheeks

Thats the wye Thats the wye she gulped out No one wont
never believethey wont NEVER Thats what she sees Miss Montaubyn
You dont E dont with a jerk toward the curate I aint nothin
but ME but blimme if I dontblimme

Sir Oliver Holt grew paler still He felt as he had done when Jinny
Montaubyns poor dress swept against him His voice shook when he
spoke

So do I he said with a sudden deep catch of the breath it was the
Answer

In a few moments more he went to the girl Polly and laid a hand on her
shoulder

I shall take you home to your mother he said I shall take you
myself and care for you both She shall know nothing you are afraid of
her hearing I shall ask her to bring up the child You will help
her

Then he touched the thief who got up white and shaking and with eyes
moist with excitement

You shall never see another man claim your thought because you have not
time or money to work it out You will go with me There are tomorrows
enough for you

Glad still sat clinging to her knees and with tears running but the
ugliness of her sharp small face was a thing an angel might have paused
to see

You dont want to go away from here Sir Oliver said to her and she
shook her head

No not me I told yer wot I wanted Lemme do it

You shall he answered and I will help you

The things which developed in Apple Blossom Court later the things
which came to each of those who had sat in the weird circle round the
fire the revelations of new existence which came to herself aroused no
amazement in Jinny Montaubyns mind She had asked and believed all
thingsand all this was but another of the Answers

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
