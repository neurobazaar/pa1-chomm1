CHAPTER ONE AN AMBITIOUS MANCHILD WAS BUDDY

In hot mid afternoon when the acrid gray dust cloud kicked up by the
listless plodding of eight thousand cloven hoofs formed the only blot on
the hard blue above the Staked Plains an ox stumbled and fell awkwardly
under his yoke and refused to scramble up when his negro driver shouted
and prodded him with the end of a willow gad

Call your master Ezra directed a quiet woman voice gone weary and
toneless with the heat and two restless children Dont beat the poor
brute He cant go any farther and carry the yoke much less pull the
wagon

Ezra dropped the gad and stepped upon the wagon tongue where he might
squint into the dust cloud and decide which gray plodding horseman
alongside the herd was Robert Birnie Far across the sluggish river of
grimy backs a horse threw up its head with a peculiar sidelong motion
and Ezras eyes lightened with recognition That was the colt Rattler
chafing against the slow pace he must keep Hands cupped around big
chocolatecolored lips and big yellowwhite teeth Ezra whooeeed the
signal that called the nearest riders to the wagon that held the bosss
family

Bob Birnie and another man turned and came trotting back and at the
call a scrambling youngster peered over his mothers shoulder in the
forward opening of the prairie schooner

Ooh Dulcie We gonna git a wile cow agin

Dulcie was asleep and did not answer and the woman in the slat
sunbonnet pushed back with her elbow the eager squirming body of her
eldest Stay in the wagon Buddy Mustnt get down amongst the oxen
One might kick you Lie down and take a nap with sister When you waken
it will be nice and cool again

Not seepy objected Buddy for the twentieth time in the past two
hours But he crawled back and his mother relieved of his restless
presence leaned forward to watch the approach of her husband and the
cowboy This was the second time in the past two days that an ox had
fallen exhausted and her eyes showed a trace of anxiety With the feed
so poor and the water so scarce it seemed as though the heavy wagon
loaded with a few household idols too dear to leave behind a camp
outfit and the necessary clothing and bedding for a woman and two
children was going to be a real handicap on the drive

Robert if we had another wagon I could drive it and make the load
less for these four oxen she suggested when her husband came up A
lighter wagon perhaps with one team of strong horses or even with a
yoke of oxen I could drive well enough and relieve these poor brutes
She pushed back her sunbonnet and with it a mass of redbrown hair that
curled damply on her forehead and smiled disarmingly Buddy would be
the happiest baby boy alive if I could let him drive now and then she
added humorously

Cant make a wagon and an extra yoke of oxen out of this cactus patch
Bob Birnie grinned good humoredly Not even to tickle Buddy Ill see
what I can do when we reach Olathe But you wont have to take a mans
place and drive Lassie He took the cup of water she drew from a keg
and profferedwater was precious on the Staked Plains that seasonand
his eyes dwelt on her fondly while he drank Then giving her hand a
squeeze when he returned the cup he rode back to scan the herd for an
animal big enough and wellconditioned enough to supplant the wornout
ox

Arent you thirsty Frank Davis I think a cup of water will do you
good she called out to the cowboy who had dismounted to tighten his
forward cinch in expectation of having to use his rope

The cowboy dropped stirrup from saddle horn and came forward
stiffleggedly leading his horse His sunbaked face grimed with the
dust of the herd was aglow with heat and his eyes showed gratitude
A cup of water from the hand of the bosss wife was worth a gallon from
the barrel slipslopping along in the lurching chuckwagon

Hows the kids makin out Mis Birnie Frank inquired politely when
he had swallowed the last drop and had wiped his mouth with the back of
his hand Its right warm and dusty tday

Theyre asleep at last thank goodness she answered glancing back
at a huddle of pink calico that showed just over the crest of a pile
of crumpled quilts Buddy has a hard time of it Hes all man in his
disposition and all baby in size Hes been teasing to walk with the
niggers and help drive the drag Is my husband calling

Her husband was and Frank rode away at a leisurely trot Haste had
little to do with trailing a herd where eight miles was called a good
days journey and six an average achievement The fallen ox was unyoked
by the mellowvoiced but exasperated Ezra and since he would not rise
the three remaining oxen urged by the gad and Ezras upbraiding
swung the wagon to one side and moved it a little farther after the
slowmoving herd so that the exhausted animal could rest and the
raw recruit be yoked in where he could do the least harm and would the
speediest learn a new lesson in discomfort Mrs Birnie glanced again
at the huddle of pink in the nest of quilts behind a beloved chest of
drawers in the wagon and sighed with relief because Buddy slept

An ambitious manchild already was Buddy accustomed to certain phrases
that since he could toddle had formed inevitable accompaniment to his
investigative footsteps Lkoutdah he had for a long time believed
to be his name among the black folk of his world White folk had varied
it slightly He knew that Runtomothernow meant that something he
would delight in but must not watch was going to take place Spankings
more or less official and not often painful signified that big folks did
not understand him and his activities or were cross about something
Now mother did not want him to watch the wild cow run and jump at the
end of a rope until finally forced to submit to the oxyoke and help
pull the wagon Buddy loved to watch them but he understood that mother
was afraid the wild cow might step on him Why she should want him to
sleep when he was not sleepy he had not yet discovered and so disdained
to give it serious consideration

Not seepy Buddy stated again emphatically as a sort of mental
dismissal of the command and crawled carefully past Sister and lifted a
flap of the canvas cover A buttonthe last buttonpopped off his pink
apron and the sleeves rumpled down over his hands It felt all loose and
useless so Buddy stopped long enough to pull the apron off and throw
it beside Sister before he crawled under the canvas flap and walked down
the spokes of a rear wheel He did not mean to get in the way of the
wild cow but he did want action for his restless legs He thought that
if he went away from the wagon and the herd and played while they were
catching the wild cow it would be just the same as if he took a nap
Mother hadnt thought of it or she might have suggested it

So Buddy went away from the wagon and down into a shallow dry wash where
the wild cow would not come and played The first thing he saw was
a scorpionnasty old bug that will bite hardand he threw rocks at it
until it scuttled under a ledge out of sight The next thing he saw that
interested him at all was a horned toad a hawntoe he called it after
Ezras manner of speaking Ezra had caught a hawntoe for him a few days
ago but it had mysteriously disappeared out of the wagon Buddy did
not connect his mothers lack of enthusiasm with the disappearance Her
sympathy with his loss had seemed to him real and he wanted another
fully believing that in this also mother would be pleased So he took
after this particular HAWNtoe that crawled into various hiding places
only to be spied and routed out with small rocks and a sharp stick

The dry wash remained shallow and after a while Buddy still in hot
pursuit of the horned toad emerged upon the level where the herd had
passed The wagon was nowhere in sight but this did not disturb Buddy
He was not lost He knew perfectly that the brown cloud on his narrowed
horizon was the dust over the herd and that the wagon was just behind
because the wind that day was blowing from the southwest and also
because the oxen did not walk as fast as the herd In the distance he
saw the Drag moving lazily along after the dustcloud with barefooted
niggers driving the laggard cattle and singing dolefully as they walked
Emphatically Buddy was not lost

He wanted that particular horned toad however and he kept after it
until he had it safe in his two hands

It happened that when he pounced at last upon the toad he disturbed
with his presence a colony of red ants on moving day The close ranks
of them coming and going in a straight line caught and held Buddys
attention to the exclusion of everything elsesave the horned toad
he had been at such pains to acquire He tucked the toad inside his
underwaist and ignored its wriggling against his flesh while he squatted
in the hot sunshine and watched the ants his mind one great question
Where were they going and what were they carrying and why were they
all in such a hurry

Buddy had to know To himself he called trailherdbut fathers cattle
did not carry white lumps of stuff on their heads and furthermore they
all walked together in the same direction whereas the ant herd traveled
both ways Buddy made sure of this and then started off following what
he had decided was the real trail of the ants Most children would have
stirred them up with a stick Buddy let them alone so that he could see
what they were doing all by themselves

The ants led him to a tiny hole with a finely pulverized rim just at the
edge of a sprawly cactus This last Buddy carefully avoided for even
at four years old he had long ago learned the sting of cactus thorns A
rattlesnake buzzed warning when he backed away and the shock to Buddys
nerves roused within him the fighting spirit Rattlesnakes he knew also
as the common enemy of men and cattle Once a steer had been bitten on
the nose and his head had swollen up so he couldnt eat Buddy did not
want that to happen to HIM

He made sure that the horned toad was safe chose a rock as large as he
could lift and heave from him and threw it at the buzzing gray coil
He did not wait to see what happened but picked up another rock a
terrific buzzing sounding stridently from the coil He threw another
and another with all the force of his healthy little muscles For a
fouryearold he aimed well several of the rocks landed on the coil

The snake wriggled feebly from under the rocks and tried to crawl away
and hide its rattles clicking listlessly Buddy had another rock in
his hands and in his eyes the blue fire of righteous conquest He
went closeclose enough to have brought a protesting cry from a
grownuplifted the rock high as he could and brought it down fair on
the battered head of the rattler The loathsome length of it winced
and thrashed ineffectively and after a few minutes lay slack the tail
wriggling aimlessly

Buddy stood with his feet far apart and his hands on his hips as he had
seen the cowboy do whom he had unconsciously imitated in the killing

Snakes like Injuns Deadns is good ens He observed sententiously
still playing the part of the cowboy Then quite sure that the snake
was dead he took it by the tail felt again of the horned toad on his
chest and went back to see what the ants were doing

When so responsible a person as a grownup stops to watch the orderly
activities of an army of ants minutes and hours slip away unnoticed
Buddy was absolutely fascinated lost to everything else When some
instinct born in the very blood of him warned Buddy that time was
passing he stood up and saw that the sun hung just above the edge of
the world and that the sky was a glorious jumble of red and purple and
soft rose

The first thing Buddy did was to stoop and study attentively the dead
snake to see if the tail still wiggled It did not though he watched
it for a full minute He looked at the sunit had not set but glowed
big and yellow as far from the earth as his father was tall Ezra had
lied to him Dead snakes did not wiggle their tails until sundown

Buddy looked for the dust cloud of the herd and was surprised to find
it smaller than he had ever seen it and farther away Indeed he could
only guess that the faint smudge on the horizon was the dust he had
followed for more days than he could count He was not afraid but he
was hungry and he thought his mother would maybe wonder where he was
and he knew that the pointriders had already stopped pushing the herd
ahead and that the cattle were feeding now so that they would bed
down at dusk The chuckwagon was camped somewhere close by and old
StepandaHalf the lame cook was stirring things in his Dutch ovens
over the campfire Buddy could almost smell the beans and the meat
stew he was so hungry He turned and took one last long look at the
endless stream of ants still crawling along picked up the dead snake by
the tail cupped the other hand over the horned toad inside his waist
and started for camp

After a while he heard someone shouting but beyond faint relief that he
was after all near his Outfit Buddy paid no attention The boys were
always shouting to one another or yelling at their horses or at the
herd or at the niggers It did not occur to him that they might
be shouting for him until from another direction he heard Ezras
unmistakable booming voice Ezra sang a thunderous baritone when the
niggers lifted up their voices in song around their campfire and he
could be heard for half a mile when he called in real earnest He was
calling now and Buddy stopping to listen fancied that he heard his
name A little farther on he was sure of it

OOOEE Whah yall Buddy OOOEEE

Im acomin Buddy shrilled impatiently What y all want

His piping voice did not carry to Ezra who kept on shouting The
radiant purple and red and gold above him deepened darkened The whole
wild expanse of halfbarren land became suddenly a place of unearthly
beauty that dulled to the shadows of dusk Buddy trudged on keeping
to the deepworn buffalo trails which the herd had followed and scored
afresh with their hoofs He could not miss his waynot Buddy son of Bob
Birnie owner of the Tomahawk outfitbut his legs were growing pretty
tired and he was so hungry that he could have sat down on the ground
and cried with the gnawing foodcall of his empty little stomach

He could hear other voices shouting at intervals now but Ezras voice
was the loudest and the closest and it seemed to Buddy that Ezra never
once stopped calling Twice Buddy called back that he was acomin but
Ezra shouted just the same OOOEE WHAH Y ALL BUDDY OOOEE

Imperceptibly dusk deepened to darkness A gust of anger swept Buddys
soul because he was tired because he was hungry and he was yet a long
way from the camp but chiefly because Ezra persisted in calling after
Buddy had several times answered He heard someone whom he recognized
as Frank Davis but by this time he was so angry that he would not say a
word though he was tempted to ask Frank to take him up on his horse and
let him ride to camp He heard othersand once the beat of hoofs came
quite close But there was a wide streak of Scotch stubbornness in
Buddyalong with several other Scotch streaksand he continued his
stumbling progress dragging the snake by the tail his other hand
holding fast the horned toad

His heart jumped up and almost choked him when first saw the three
twinkles on the ground which knew were not stars but campfires

Quite unexpectedly he trudged into the firelight where StepandaHalf
was stirring delectable things in the iron pots and stopping every
minute or so to stare anxiously into the gloom Buddy stood blinking and
sniffing his eyes fixed upon the Dutch ovens

Im HUNGRY he announced accusingly gripping the toad that had begun
to squirm at the heat and light I kilt a snake an Im HUNGRY

Good gorry swore StepandaHalf and whipped out his sixshooter and
fired three shots into the air

Footsteps came scurrying Buddys mother swept him into her arms
laughing with a little whimpering sound of tears in the laughter Buddy
wriggled protestingly in her arms

Lkout Y all SKUCSH im I got a HAWNtoe wight here He patted his
chest gloatingly An I got a snake I kilt im An Im HUNGRY

Mother of Buddy though she was Lassie set him down hurriedly and
surveyed her manchild from a little distance

Buddy Drop that snake instantly

Buddy obeyed but he planted a foot close to his kill and pouted his
lips S my snake I kilt im He said firmly He pulled the horned
toad from his waistfront and held it tightly in his two hands Ans my
hawntoe I ketchedm Way ova dere he added tilting his tow head
toward the darkness behind him

Bob Birnie rode up at a gallop pulled up his horse in the edge of the
fire glow and dismounted hastily

Bob Birnie never needed more than one glance to furnish him the details
of a scene He saw the very small boy confronting his mother with a dead
snake a horned toad and a stubborn set to his lips He saw that the
mother looked rather helpless before the combinationand his brown
mustache hid a smile He walked up and looked his firstborn over

Buddy He demanded sternly where have you been

Out dere Kilt a snake Ants was trailing a herd I got a HAWNtoe An
Im hungry

You know better than to leave the wagon young man Didnt you know we
had to get out and hunt you and mother was scared the wolves might eat
you Didnt you hear us calling you Why didnt you answer

Buddy looked up from under his baby eyebrows at his father who seemed
very tall and very terrible But his bare foot touched the dead snake
and he took comfort I was comin he said I WASNT los I bringed
my snake and my hawntoe An deyWASNTanywoluffs The last word
came muffled buried in his mothers skirts



CHAPTER TWO THE TRAIL HERD

Day after day the trail herd plodded slowly to the north following the
buffalo trails that would lead to water and the crude map of one who
had taken a herd north and had returned with a tale of vast plains and
no rivals Always through the day the dust cloud hung over the backs of
the cattle settled into the clothes of those who followed grimed the
pink aprons of Buddy and his small sister Dulcie so that they were no
longer pink Whenever a stream was reached mother searched patiently
for clear water and an untrampled bit of bank where she might do the
family washing leaving Ezra to mind the children But even so the crust
and the wear and tear of travel remained to harass her fastidious soul

Buddy remembered that drive as he could not remember the comfortable
ranch house of his earlier babyhood To him afterward it seemed that
life began with the great herd of cattle He came to know just how low
the sun must slide from the top of the sky before the point would
spread out with noses to the ground pausing wherever a mouthful of
grass was to be found When these leaders of the herd stopped the
cattle would scatter and begin feeding If there was water they would
crowd the banks of the stream or pool pushing and prodding one another
with their great sharp horns Later when the sun was gone and dusk
crept out of nowhere the cowboys would ride slowly around the herd
pushing it quietly into a smaller compass Then if Buddy were not too
sleepy he would watch the cattle lie down to chew their cuds in deep
sighing content until they slept It reminded Buddy vaguely of when
mother popped corn in a wire popper a long time agobefore they all
lived in a wagon and went with the herd First one and twothen there
would be three four five as many as Buddy could countthen the whole
herd would be lying down

Buddy loved the campfires The cowboys would sit around the one where
his father and mother satmother with Dulcie in her armsand they
would smoke and tell stories until mother told him it was time little
boys were in bed Buddy always wanted to know what they said after he
had climbed into the big wagon where mother had made a bed but he never
found out He could remember lying there listening sometimes to the
niggers singing at their own campfire within call Ezra always singing
the loudestjust as a bull always could be heard above the bellowing
of the herd

All his life Ezras singing and the monotonous bellowing of a herd
reminded Buddy of one mysteriously terrible time when there werent
any rivers or any ponds or anything along the trail and they had to be
careful of the water and save it and he and Dulcie were not asked
to wash their faces I think that miracle helped to fix the incident
indelibly in Buddys mind that and the bellowing of the cattle It
seemed a month to Buddy but as he grew older he learned that it was
three days they went without water

The first day he did not remember especially except that mother had
talked about clean aprons that night and failed to produce any The
second he recalled quite clearly Father came to the wagons sometime in
the night to see if mother was asleep Their murmured talk wakened Buddy
and he heard father say

Well hold em all right Lassie And theres water ahead Its marked
on the trail map Dont you worryIll stay up and help the boys The
cattle are uneasybut well hold em

The third day Buddy never forgot That was the day when mother forgot
that Q stands for Quagga and permitted Buddy to call it P just for
fun because it looked so much like P And when he said W is water 
mother made a funny sound and said right out loud Oh God please and
told Buddy to creep back and play with Sisterwhen Sister was asleep
and there were still x y and z to say let alone that mysterious
Andsoforth which seemed to mean so much and so little and never was
called upon to help spell a word Never since he began to have lessons
had mother omitted a single letter or cut the study hour down the
teeniest little bit

Buddy was afraid of something but he could not think what it was that
frightened him He began to think seriously about water and to listen
uneasily to the constant lowing of the herd The increased shouting
of the niggers driving the lagging ones held a sudden significance It
occurred to him that the niggers had their hands full and that they had
never driven so big a Drag It was hotter than ever too and they had
twice stopped to yoke in fresh oxen Ezra had boasted all along that
ole Bawley would keep his end up till they got clah to Wyoming But ole
Bawley had stopped and stopped and at last had to be taken out of the
yoke Buddy began to wish they would hurry up and find a river

None of the cowboys would take him on the saddle and let him ride that
day They looked harassedBuddy called it crosswhen they rode up to
the wagon to give their horses a few mouthfuls of water from the barrel
StepandaHalf couldnt spare any more they told mother He had
declared at noon that he needed every drop he had for the cooking and
there would be no washing of dishes whatever Later mother had studied
a map and afterwards had sat for a long while staring out over the backs
of the cattle her face white Buddy thought perhaps mother was sick

That day lasted hours and hours longer than any other day that Buddy
could remember His father looked cross too when he rode back to them
Once it was to look at the map which mother had studied They talked
together afterwards and Buddy heard his father say that she must not
worry the cattle had good bottom and could stand thirst better than a
poor herd and another dry camp would not really hurt anyone

He had uncovered the water barrel and looked in and had ridden straight
over to the chuckwagon his horse walking alongside the high seat where
StepandaHalf sat perched listlessly with a longlashed oxwhip in his
hand Father had talked for a few minutes and had ridden back scowling

That old scoundrel has got two tengallon kegs that havent been
touched he told mother Yo all mustnt water any more horses out of
your barrel Send the boys to StepandaHalf Yo all keep what youve
got The horses have got to have watertonight its going to be hell
to hold the herd and if anybody goes thirsty itll be the men not the
horses But yo all send them to the other wagon Lassie Mind now Not a
drop to anyone

After father rode away Buddy crept up and put his two short arms around
mother Dont cry I dont have to drink any water he soothed her He
waited a minute and added optimistically Deres a BIIG wiver comin
pitty soon Oxes smells water a hunerd miles Ezra says so An las
night Crumpy was snuffin an snuffin I saw im do it He smelt a BIG
wiver THAT biig He spread his short arms as wide apart as they would
reach and smiled tremulously

Mother squeezed Buddy so hard that he grunted

Dear little man of course there is WE dont mind do we Iwas
feeling sorry for the poor cattle

Dere firsty Buddy stated solemnly his eyes big Dere bawlin fer
a drink of water I guess dere AWFUL firsty Deres a big wiver comin
now Crumpy smelt a big wiver

Buddys mother stared across the arid plain parched into greater
barrenness by the heat that had been unremitting for the past week
Buddys faith in the big river she could not share Somehow they had
drifted off the trail marked on the map drawn by George Williams

Williams had warned them to carry as much water as possible in barrels
as a precaution against suffering if they failed to strike water each
night He had told them that water was scarce but that his cowboy
scouts and the deepworn buffalo trails had been able to bring him
through with water at every camp save two or three The Staked Plains
he said would be the hardest drive And this was the Staked Plainsand
it was hard driving

Buddy did not know all that until afterwards when he heard father talk
of the drive north But he would have remembered that day and the night
that followed even though he had never heard a word about it
The bawling of the herd became a doleful chant of misery Even the
phlegmatic oxen that drew the wagons bawled and slavered while they
strained forward twisting their heads under the heavy yokes They
stopped oftener than usual to rest and when Buddy was permitted to walk
with the perspiring Ezra by the leaders he wondered why the oxens eyes
were red like Dulcies when she had one of her crying spells

At night the cowboys did not tie their horses and sit down while they
ate but stood by their mounts and bolted food hurriedly one eye always
on the restless cattle that walked around and around and would neither
eat nor lie down but lowed incessantly Once a few animals came close
enough to smell the water in a bucket where Frank Davis was watering
his sweatstreaked horse and StepandaHalfs wagon was almost upset
before the maddened cattle could be driven back to the main herd

No use camping Bob Birnie told the boys gathered around
StepandaHalfs Dutch ovens The cattle wont stand Well wear
ourselves and them out trying to hold emthey may as well be hunting
water as running in circles StepandaHalf keep your cooked grub
handy for the boys and yo all pack up and pull out Well turn the
cattle loose and follow If theres any water in this damned country
theyll find it

Years afterwards Buddy learned that his father had sent men out to
hunt water and that they had not found any He was ten when this was
discussed around a spring roundup fire and he had studied the matter
for a few minutes and then had spoken boldly his mind

You oughta kept your horses as thirsty as the cattle was and I bet
theyd a found that water he criticized and was sent to bed for his
tactlessness Bob Birnie himself had thought of that afterwards and had
excused the oversight by saying that he had depended on the map and had
not foreseen a threeday dry drive

However that may be that night was a night of panicky desperation
Ezra walked beside the oxen and shouted and swung his lash and the
oxen strained forward bellowing so that not even Dulcie could sleep
but whimpered fretfully in her mothers arms Buddy sat up wideeyed and
watched for the big river and tried not to be a fraidcat and cry like
Dulcie

It was long past starry midnight when a little wind puffed out of the
darkness and the oxen threw up their heads and sniffed and put a new
note into their Mbawawawmm They swung sharply so that the wind
blew straight into the front of the wagon which lurched forward with a
new impetus

Gloory t Gawd Missy dey smells watah sho s yo bawn sobbed Ezra
as he broke into a trot beside the wheelers Taint furlookit datah
huhd agoin it No m Missy DEY aint woah outdey smellin watah
an deym gittin TO it Taint fur Missy

Buddy clung to the back of the seat and stared roundeyed into the
gloom He never forgot that lumpy shadow which was the herd traveling
fast in dust that obscured the nearest stars The shadow humped here
and there as the cattle crowded forward at a shuffling half trot the
clickawash of their shambling feet treading close on one another The
rapping tattoo of widespread horns clashing against widespread horns
filled him with a formless terror so that he let go the seat to clutch
at mothers dress He was not afraid of cattlethey were as much a
part of his world as were Ezra and the wagon and the campfiresbut he
trembled with the dread which no man could name for him

These were not the normal everyday sounds of the herd The herd had
somehow changed from plodding animals to one overwhelming purpose that
would sweep away anything that came in its path Two thousand parched
throats and dustdry tonguesand suddenly the smell of water that would
go gurgling down two thousand eager gullets and every intervening
second a cursed delay against which the cattle surged blindly It was
the mob spirit when the mob was fighting for its very existence

Over the bellowing of the cattle a yelling cowboy now and then made
himself heard The four oxen straining under their yokes broke into
a lumbering gallop lest they be outdistanced by the herd and Dulcie
screamed when the wagon lurched across a dry wash and almost upset
while Ezra plied the oxwhip and yelled frantically at first one ox and
then another inventing names for the new ones Buddy drew in his breath
and held it until the wagon rolled on four wheels instead of two but he
did not scream

Still the big river did not come It seemed to Buddy that the cattle
would never stop running Tangled in the terror was Ezras shouting
as he ran alongside the wagon and called to Missy that it was Dat ole
Crumpy actin the fool and that the wagon wouldnt upset Nom deys
jest in a hurry to git dere fool haids sunk to de eyes in dat watah Dey
aint aimin to run awaynom dish yer aint no stampede

Perhaps Buddy dozed The next thing he remembered day was breaking
with the sun all red seen through the dust The herd was still going
but now it was running and somehow the yoked oxen were keeping close
behind lumbering along with heads held low and the sweat reeking from
their spent bodies Buddy heard dimly his mothers sharp command to
Ezra

Stand back Ezra Were not going to be caught in that terrible trap
Theyre piling over the bank ahead of us Get away from the leaders I
am going to shoot

Buddy crawled up a little higher on the blankets behind the seat and
saw mother steady herself and aim the rifle straight at Crumpy There
was the familiar deafening roar the acrid smell of black powder smoke
and Crumpy went down loosely his nose rooting the trampled ground for
a space before the gun belched black smoke again and Crumpys yokemate
pitched forward The wagon stopped so abruptly that Buddy sprawled
helplessly on his back like an overturned beetle

He saw mother stand looking down at the wheelers that backed and
twisted their necks under their yokes Her lips were set firmly
together and her eyes were bright with purple hollows beneath She held
the rifle for a moment then set the butt of it on the jockey box just
in front of the dashboard The wheelers helpless between the weight of
the wagon behind and the dead oxen in front might twist their necks off
but they could do no damage

Unyoke the wheelers Ezra and let the poor creatures have their chance
at the water she cried sharply and Ezra dodging the horns of the
frantic brutes made shift to obey

Fairly on the bank of the sluggish stream with its floodworn channel
and its treacherous patches of quicksand the wagon thus halted by the
sheer nerve and quickthinking of mother became a very small island in a
troubled sea of weltering backs and tossing horns and staring eyeballs
Riders shouted and lashed unavailingly with their quirts trying to
hold back the full bulk of the herd until the foremost had slaked
their thirst and gone on But the herd was crazy for the water and
the foremost were plunged headlong into the soft mud where they mired
trampled under the hoofs of those who came crowding from behind

Someone shouted close to the wagon yet down the bank at the edge of the
water The words were indistinguishable but a warning was in the voice
On the echo of that cry a man screamed twice

Ezra cried mother fiercely Its Frank Davistheyve got him down
somehow Climb over the backs of the cattleTheres no other wayand
GET HIM

Yasm Missy Ezra called back and then Buddy saw him go over the
herd scrambling jumping from back to back

Buddy remembered that always and the funeral they had later in the day
when the herd was again just trailweary cattle feeding hungrily on the
scanty grass Down at the edge of the creek the carcasses of many dead
animals lay halfburied in the mud Up on a little knoll where a few
stunted trees grew the negroes dug a long deep hole Mothers eyes
were often filled with tears that day and the cowboys scarcely talked
at all when they gathered at the chuckwagon

After a while they all went to the hole which the negroes had dug and
there was a long Something wrapped up in canvas Mother wore her best
dress which was black and father and all the boys had shaved their
faces and looked very sober The negroes stood back in a group by
themselves and every few minutes Buddy saw them draw their tattered
shirtsleeves across their faces And fatherBuddy looked once and saw
two tears running down fathers cheeks Buddy was shocked into a stony
calm He had never dreamed that fathers ever cried

Mother read out of her Bible and all the boys held their hats in front
of them with their hands clasped and looked at the ground while she
read Then mother sang She sang We shall meet beyond the river
which Buddy thought was a very queer song because they were all there
but Frank Davis then she sang Nearer My God to Thee Buddy sang
too piping the notes accurately with a vague pronunciation of the
words and a feeling that somehow he was helping mother

After that they put the long canvaswrapped Something down in the hole
and mother said Our Father Who Art in Heaven  with Buddy repeating it
uncertainly after her and pausing to say TRETHpatheth very carefully
Then mother picked up Dulcie in her arms took Buddy by the hand and
walked slowly back to the wagon and would not let him turn to see what
the boys were doing

It was from that day that Buddy missed Frank Davis who had mysteriously
gone to Heaven according to mother Buddys interest in Heaven was
extremely keen for a time and he asked questions which not even mother
could answer Then his memory of Frank Davis blurred But never his
memory of that terrible time when the Tomahawk outfit lost five hundred
cattle in the dry drive and the stampede for water



CHAPTER THREE SOME INDIAN LORE

Buddy knew Indians as he knew cattle horses rattlesnakes and
stormsby having them mixed in with his everyday life He couldnt tell
you where or when he had learned that Indians are tricky Perhaps his
first ideas on that subject were gleaned from the friendly tribes who
lived along the Chisolm Trail and used to visit the chuckwagon their
blankets held close around them and their eyes glancing everywhere while
they grinned and talked and pointedand ate Buddy used to sit in the
chuckwagon out of harms way and watch them eat

StepandaHalf had a way of entertaining Indians which never failed
to interest Buddy however often he witnessed it When StepandaHalf
glimpsed Indians coming afar off he would take his dishpan and dump
into it whatever scraps of food were left over from the preceding meal
He used to say that Indians could smell grub as far as a buzzard can
smell a dead carcase and Buddy believed it for they always arrived at
meal time or shortly afterwards StepandaHalf would make a stew if
there were scraps enough If the gleanings were small he would use the
dishwaterhe was a frugal manand with that for the startoff he would
make soup which the Indians gulped down with great relish and many
gurgly sounds

Buddy watched them eat what he called pigdinner When StepandaHalf
was not looking he saw them steal whatever their dirty brown hands could
readily snatch and hide under their blankets So he knew from very early
experience that Indians were not to be trusted

Once when he had again strayed too far from camp some Indians riding
that way saw him and one leaned and lifted him from the ground and rode
off with him Buddy did not struggle much He saved his breath for the
long shrill yell of cowcountry Twice he yodled before the Indian
clapped a hand over his mouth

Father and some of the cowboys heard and came after riding hard and
shooting as they came Buddys pink apron fluttered a signal flag in the
arms of his captor and so it happened that the bullets whistled close
to that particular Indian He gathered a handful of calico between
Buddys shoulders held him aloft like a puppy leaned far over and
deposited him on the ground

Buddy rolled over twice and got up a little dizzy and very indignant
and shouted to father Shoot a sunsyguns

From that time Buddy added hatred to his distrust of Indians

From the time when he was four until he was thirteen Buddys life
contained enough thrills to keep a moviemad boy of today sitting on
the edge of his seat gasping enviously through many a reel but to Buddy
it was all rather humdrum and monotonous

What he wanted to do was to get out and hunt buffalo Just herding
horses and watching out for Indians and killing rattlesnakes was what
any boy in the country would be doing Still Buddy himself achieved now
and then a thrill

There was one day when he stood heedlessly on a ridge looking for a
dozen head of lost horses in the draws below It was all very well to
explain missing horses by the conjecture that the Injuns must have got
them but Buddy happened to miss old Rattler with the others Rattler
had come north with the trail herd and he was wise beyond the wisdom of
most horses He would drive cattle out of the brush without a rider to
guide him if only you put a saddle on him He had helped Buddy to mount
his backwhen Buddy was much smaller than nowby lowering his head
until Buddy straddled it and then lifting it so that Buddy slid down
his neck and over his withers to his back Even now Buddy sometimes
mounted that way when no one was looking Many other lovable traits had
Rattler and to lose him would be a tragedy to the family

So Buddy was on the ridge scanning all the deep little washes and
draws when a bullet PINGGGED over his head Buddy caught the bridle
reins and pulled his horse into the shelter of rocks untied his rifle
from the saddle and crept back to reconnoitre It was the first time he
had ever been shot atexcept in the army posts when the Indians
had broken outand the aim then was generally directed toward his
vicinity rather than his person

An Indian on a horse presently appeared cautiously from cover and
Buddy trembling with excitement shot wild but not so wild that the
Indian could afford to scoff and ride closer After another ineffectual
shot at Buddy he whipped his horse down the ridge and made for Bannock
creek

Buddy at thirteen knew more of the wiles of Indians than does the
hardiest Indian fighter on the screen today Father had warned him
never to chase an Indian into cover where others would probably be
waiting for him So he stayed where he was pretty well hidden in the
rocks and let the bullets he himself had run in fathers bulletmold
follow the enemy to the fringe of bushes His last shot knocked the
Indian off his horseor so it looked to Buddy He waited for a long
time watching the brush and thinking what a fool that Indian was to
imagine Buddy would follow him down there After a while he saw the
Indians horse climbing the slope across the creek There was no rider

Buddy rode home without the missing horses and did not tell anyone
about the Indian though his thoughts would not leave the subject

He wondered what mother would think of it Mothers interests seemed
mostly confined to teaching Buddy and Dulcie what they were deprived of
learning in schools and to play the pianoa wonderful old square piano
that had come all the way from Scotland to the Tomahawk ranch the very
frontier of the West

Mother was a wonderful woman with a soft voice and a slight Scotch
accent and wit and a knowledge of things which were little known in
the wilderness Buddy never dreamed then how strangely culture was mixed
with pure savagery in his life To him the secret regret that he had not
dared ride into the bushes to scalp the Indian he believed he had shot
and the fact that his hands were straining at the full chords of
the ANVIL CHORUS on that very evening was not even to be considered
unusual Still certain strains of that classic were always afterward
associated in his mind with the shooting of the Indianif he had really
shot him

While he counted the time with a conscientious regard for the rests he
debated the wisdom of telling mother and decided that perhaps he had
better keep that matter to himself like a man



CHAPTER FOUR BUDDY GIVES WARNING

Buddy swung down from his horse unsaddled it and went staggering to the
stable wall with the burden of a stocksaddle much too big for him He
had to stand on his boottoes to reach and pull the bridle down over the
ears of Whitefoot which turned with an air of immense relief into the
corral gate and the hay piled at the further end Buddy gave him
one preoccupied glance and started for the cabin walking with the
cowpunchers peculiar bowlegged gait which comes of wearing chaps and
throwing out the knees to overcome the stiffness of the leather At
thirteen Buddy was a cowboy from hatcrown to spursand at thirteen
Buddy gloried in the fact Today however his mind was weighted with
matters of more importance than himself

The Utes are having a wardance mother he announced when he had
closed the stout door of the kitchen behind him They mean it this
time I lay in the brush and watched them last night He stood looking
at his mother speculatively a little grin on his face I told you you
cant change an Injun by learning him to eat with a knife and fork he
added Colorou aint any whiter than he was before you set out to learn
him manners He was hoppin higher than any of em

Teach Buddy not learn You know better than to say learn him
manners

Teach him manners Buddy corrected himself obediently I was thinking
more about what I saw than about grammar Wheres father I guess Id
better tell him Hell want to get the stock out of the mountains I
should think

Colorou will send me word before they take the warpath mother
observed reassuringly He always has I gave him a whole pound of tea
and a blue ribbon the last time he was here

Yes and the last time they broke out they got away with more n a
hundred head of cattle You got to Laramie all right but he didnt
tell father in time to make a roundup back in the foothills Theyre
DANCING mother

Well I suppose Were due for an outbreak sighed mother Colorou
says he cant hold his young men off when some of the tribe have been
killed He himself doesnt countenance the stealing and the occasional
killing of white men There are bad Indians and good ones

I know a couple of good ones Buddy murmured as he made for the wash
basin Its the bad ones that were doing the dancing mother he flung
over his shoulder And if I was you Id take Dulcie and the cats and
hit for Laramie Colorou might get busy and forget to send word

If I WAS you Mother came up and nipped his ear between thumb and
finger Robert I am discouraged over you All that I teach you in the
winter seems to evaporate from your mind during the summer when you go
out riding with the boys

Buddy wiped his face with an upanddown motion on the roller towel and
clanked across to the cupboard which he opened investigatively Any
pie he questioned as he peered into the corners Say if I had the
handling of those Utes mother Id fix em so they wouldnt be breaking
out every few months and making folks leave their homes to be pawed over
and burnt maybe He found a jar of fresh doughnuts and took three

Theyll tromp around on your flowerbedsit just makes me SICK when
I think how theyll muss things up around here I wish now He blurted
unthinkingly that I hadnt killed the Injun that stole Rattler

Buddy Not YOU His mother made a swift little run across the kitchen
and caught him on his lean hardmuscled young shoulders Youyou
baby What did you do You didnt harm an Indian did you laddie

Buddy tilted his head downward so that she could not look into his eyes
I dunno as I harmed himmuch he said wiping doughnut crumbs from
his mouth with one hasty sweep of his forearm But his horse came
outa the brush and he never I guess I killed him all right Anyway
mother I had to He took a shot at me first It was the day we lost
Rattler and the bronks He added accurately

Mother did not say anything for a minute and Buddy hung his head lower
dreading to see the hurt look which he felt was in her eyes

I have to pack a gun when I ride anywhere he reminded her
defensively It aint to balance me on the horse either If Injuns
take in after me the guns so I can shoot And a feller dont shoot
up in the airand if an Injun is hunting trouble he oughta expect that
maybe he might get shot sometime Youyou wouldnt want me to just run
and let them catch me would you

Mothers hand slipped up to his head and pressed it against her breast
so that Buddy heard her heart beating steady and sweet and true Mother
wasnt afraidnever never

I knowits the dreadful necessity of defending our lives But youre
so youngjust mothers baby man

Buddy looked up at her then a laugh twinkling in his eyes After all
mother understood

Im going to be your baby man always if you want me to mother He
whispered closing his arms around her neck in a sturdy hug But Im
fathers horsewrangler too And a horsewrangler has got to hold
up his end II didnt want to kill anybody honest But Injuns are
different You kill rattlers and they aint as mean as Injuns That one
I shot at was shooting at me before I even so much as knew there was one
around I just shot back Father would or anybody else

I knowI know she conceded the tender womanliness of her sighing
over the need In the next moment she was all mother ready to fight for
her young Buddy never never ride ANYWHERE without your rifle And a
revolver toobe sure that it is in perfect condition Andhave you
a knife Youre so LITTLE she wailed But father will need you and
hell take care of youand Colorou would not let you be hurt if he
knew ButBuddy you must be careful and always watchingnever let
them catch you off your guard I shall be in Laramie before you and
father and the boys I suppose if the Indians really do break out And
you must promise me

Ill promise mother And dont you go and trust old Colorou an inch
He was jumping higher than any of em and shaking his tomahawk and
yellinghed have scalped me right there if hed seen me watching em
Mother Im going to find father and tell him And you may as well be
packing up anddont leave my guitar for them to smash will you
mother

His mother laughed then and pushed him toward the door She had an idea
of her own and she did not want to be hindered now in putting it into
action Up the creek in the bank behind a clump of willows was a
small caveor a large niche one might call itwhere many household
treasures might be safely hidden if one went carefully wading in the
creek to hide the tracks She followed Buddy out and called to Ezra
who was chopping wood with a grunt for every fall of the axe and many
restperiods in the shade of the cottonwood tree

At the stable Buddy looked back and saw her talking earnestly to Ezra
who stood nodding his head in complete approval Buddys knowledge of
women began and ended with his mother Therefore to him all women
were wonderful creatures whom men worshipped ardently because they were
created for the adoration of lesser souls Buddy did not know what his
mother was going to do but he was sure that whatever she did would be
right so he hoisted his saddle on the handiest fresh horse and loped
off to drive in the remuda feeling certain that his father would move
swiftly to save his cattle that ranged back in the foothills and that
the saddle horses would be wanted at a moments notice

Also he reasoned the range horses mares and colts and the unbroken
geldings would not be left to the mercy of the Indians He did not
quite know how his father would manage it but he decided that he would
corral the REMUDA first and then drive in the other horses that fed
scattered in undisturbed possession of a favorite grassy creekbottom
farther up the Platte

The saddle horses accustomed to Buddys driving were easily corralled
The other horses were fat and sassy and resented his coming among them
with the shrill whoop of authority They gave him a hot hours riding
before they finally bunched and went tearing down the river bottom
toward the ranch Even so Buddy left two of the wildest careening up
a narrow gulch He had not attempted to ride after them not because he
was afraid of Indians for he was not The wardance held every young
buck and every old one in camp beyond the Pass But the margin of safety
might be narrow and Buddy was taking no chances that day

When he was convinced that it was impossible for one boy to be in half a
dozen places at once and that the cowboys would be needed to corral the
range bunch Buddy whooped them all down the creek below the home ranch
and let them go just as his father came riding up to the corral

Theyre wardancing father Buddy shouted eagerly slipping off his
horse and wiping away the trickles of perspiration with a handkerchief
not much redder than his face I drove all the horses down so theyd
be handy Them range horses are pretty wild There was two I couldnt
get Whatll I do now

Bob Birnie looked at his youngest rider and smoothed his beard with one
hand Youre an ambitious lad Buddy Its the Utes youre meaningor
is it the horses

Buddy lifted his head and stared at his father disapprovingly

Colorou is going to break out I know Theyve got their war paint all
on and theyre dancing I saw them myself I was going after the gloves
Colorou s squaw was making for mebut I didnt get em I laid in the
brush and watched em dance He stopped and looked again doubtfully at
his father I thought you might want to get the cattle outa the way he
added I thought I could save some time

Youre sure about the paint

Yes Im sure And Colorou was just agoing it with his war bonnet on
and shaking his tomahawk and yelling

Ye did well lad Well be leaving for Big Creek tonight so run away
now and rest yourself

Oh and can I go Buddys voice was shrill with eagerness

Ill need you lad to look after the horses It will give me one more
hand with the cattle Now go tell StepandaHalf to make ready for a
week on the trail and to have supper early so he can make his start
with the rest

Buddy walked stiffly away to the cooks cabin where StepandaHalf sat
leisurely gouging the worst blemishes out of soft old potatoes with a
chronic tendency to grow sprouts before he peeled them for supper His
crippled leg was thrust out straight his hat was perched precariously
over one ear because of the slanting sun rays through the window and
a halfsmoked cigarette waggled uncertainly in the corner of his mouth
while he sang dolefully a most optimistic ditty of the West

O give me a home where the buffalo roam Where the deer and the
antelope play Where never is heard a discouraging word And the sky is
not cloudy all day

Youre going to hear a discouraging word right now Buddy broke in
ruthlessly upon the song Whereupon with a bit of importance in
his voice and in his manner he proceeded to spoil StepandaHalfs
disposition and to deepen if that were possible his loathing of
Indians Too often had he made dubious soup of his dishwater and the
leavings from a roundup crews dinner and watched blanketed bucks
smack lips over the mess to run from them now without feeling utterly
disgusted with life StepandaHalfs vituperations could be heard
above the clatter of pots and pans as he made ready for the journey

That nights ride up the pass through the narrow range of highpeaked
hills to the Tomahawks farthest range on Big Creek was a tedious
affair to Buddy A man had been sent on a fast horse to warn the nearest
neighbor who in turn would warn the nextuntil no settler would
be left in ignorance of his danger Ezra was already on the trail to
Laramie with mother and Dulcie and the cats and a slat box full of
chickens and a young sow with little pigs

Buddy whose word no one had questioned who might pardonably have
considered himself a hero was concerned chiefly with his mothers
flower garden which he had helped to plant and had watered more or
less faithfully with creek water carried in buckets He was afraid the
Indians would step on the poppies and the phlox and trample down the
four oclocks which were just beginning to branch out and look nice and
bushy and to blossom The scent of the four oclocks had been in his
nostrils when he came out at dusk with his fur overcoat which mother had
told him must not be left behind Buddy himself merely liked flowers
but mother talked to them and kissed them just for love and pitied them
if Buddy forgot and let them go thirsty He would have stayed to fight
for mothers flower garden if it would have done any good

He was thinking sleepily that next year he would plant flowers in boxes
that could be carried to the cave if the Indians broke out again when
Tex Farley poked him in the ribs and told him to wake up or hed fall
off his horse It was a weary climb to the top of the range that divided
the valley of Big Creek from the North Platte and a wearier climb down
Twice Buddy caught himself on the verge of toppling out of the saddle
For after all he was only a thirteenyear Old boy growing like any
other healthy young animal He had been riding hard that day and half of
the preceding night when he had raced back from the Reservation to
give warning of the impending outbreak He needed sleep and nature was
determined that he should have it



CHAPTER FIVE BUDDY RUNS TRUE TO TYPE

One never could predict with any certainty how long Indians would dance
before they actually took the trail of murder and pillage So much
depended upon the Medicine so much on signs and portents It was even
possible that they might for some mysterious reason unknown to their
white neighbors decide at the last moment to bide their time The
Tomahawk outfit worked from dawn until dark and combed the foothills
of the Snowies hurriedly riding into the most frequented grassy basins
and wide canyons where the grass was lush and sweet and the mountain
streams rushed noisily over rocks As fast as the cattle were gathered
they were pushed hastily toward the Platte And though the men rode
warily with rifles as handy as their ropes they rode in peace

Buddy proud of his job counting himself as good a man as any of them
became a small riding demon after rebellious saddle horses herding them
away from thick undergrowth that might for all he knew hold Indians
waiting a chance to scalp him driving the REMUDA close to the cabins
when night fell because no man could be spared for night herding
sleeping lightly as a cat beside a mouse hole He did not say much
perhaps because everyone was too busy to talk himself included

Men rode in at night dogweary pulled their saddles and hurried stiffly
to the cabin where StepandaHalf was showing his true worth as a cook
who could keep the coffeepot boiling and yet be ready to pack up and
go at the first rifleshot They would bolt down enormous quantities of
bannock and boiled beef swallow their coffee hot enough to scald a hog
and stretch themselves out immediately to sleep

Buddy would be up and on his horse in the clear starlight before dawn
with a cup of coffee swallowed to hearten him for the chilly ride after
the remuda Even with the warmth of the coffee his teeth would chatter
just at first and he would ride with his thin shoulders lifted and a
hand in a pocket He could not sing or whistle to keep himself company
He must ride in silence until he had counted every dark moving shape
and knew that the herd was complete then ease them quietly to camp

On the fourth morning he rode anxiously up the valley fearing that the
horses had been stolen in the night yet hoping they had merely strayed
up the creek to find fresh pastures A light breeze that carried the
keen edge of frost made his nose tingle His horse trotted steadily
forward as keen on the trail as Buddy himself keener for he would be
sure to give warning of danger So they rounded a bend in the creek and
came upon the scattered fringe of the remuda cropping steadily at the
meadow grass there

Bud circled them glancing now and then at the ridge beyond the valley
It seemed somehow unnaturallower with the stars showing along its
wooded crest in a row as if there were no peaks Then quite suddenly he
knew that the ridge was the same and that the stars he saw were little
breakfast campfires His heart gave a jump when he realized how many
little fires there were and knew that the dance was over The Indians
had left the reservation and had crossed the ridge yesterday and had
camped there to wait for the dawn

While he gathered his horses together he guessed how old Colorou had
planned to catch the Tomahawk riders when they left camp and scattered
two by two on Circle He had held his band well out of sight and
sound of the Big Creek cabin and if the horses had not strayed up the
creek in the night he would have caught the white men off their guard

Buddy looked often over his shoulder while he drove the horses down the
creek It seemed stranger than luck that he had been compelled to ride
so far on this particular morning as if mothers steadfast faith in
prayer and the guardianship of angels was justified by actual facts
Still Buddy was too hardheaded to assume easily that angels had driven
the horses up the creek so that he would have to ride up there and
discover the Indian fires If angels could do that why hadnt they
stopped Colorou from going on the warpath It would have been simpler
in Buddys opinion

He did not mention the angel problem to his father however Bob Birnie
was eating breakfast with his men when Buddy rode up to the cabin and
told the news The boys did not say anything much but they may have
taken bigger bites by way of filling their stomachs in less time than
usual

Ill go see for myself said Bob Birnie You boys saddle up and
be ready to start If its Indians well head for Laramie and drive
everything before us as we go But the lad may be wrong He took the
reins from Buddy mounted and rode away his booted feet hanging far
below Buddys short stirrups

Speedily he was back and the scowl on his face told plainly enough that
Buddy had not been mistaken

Theyre coming off the ridge already he announced grimly I heard
their horses among the rocks up there They think to come down on us at
sunrise Therell be too many for us to hold off Im thinking Get ye a
fresh horse Buddy and drive the horses down the creek fast as ye can

Buddy uncoiled his rope and ran with his mouth full to do as he was
told He did not think he was scared exactly but he made three throws
to get the horse he wanted blaming the poor light for his ill luck
and then found himself in possession of a tall uneasy brown that Dick
Grimes had broken and sometimes rode Buddy would have turned him loose
and caught another but the horses had sensed the suppressed excitement
of the men and were circling and snorting in the half light of dawn so
Buddy led out the brown pulled the saddle from the sweaty horse that
had twice made the trip up the creek and heaved it hastily on the
browns back Dick Grimes called to him to know if he wanted any help
and Buddy yelled No

Here they comedamn emturn the bunch loose and ride called Bob
Birnie as a shrill yelling warwhoop like the yapping of many coyotes
sounded from the cottonwoods that bordered the creek Yuh all right
Buddy

YeahIm acomin shrilled Buddy hastily looping the latigo Just
then the sharp staccato of rifleshots mingled with the whooping of the
Indians Buddy was reaching for the saddle horn when the brown horse
ducked and jerked loose Before Buddy realized what was happening the
brown horse the herd and all the riders were pounding away down the
valley the men firing back at the cottonwoods

In the dust and clamor of their departure Buddy stood perfectly still
for a minute trying to grasp the full significance of his calamity
StepandaHalf had packed hastily and departed ahead of them all His
father and the cowboys were watching the cottonwood grove many rods to
Buddys right and well in the background and they would not glance his
way Even if they did they would not see him and if they saw him it
would be madness to ride backthough there was not a man among them who
would not have wheeled in his tracks and returned for Buddy in the very
face of Colorou and his band

From the cottonwoods came the pound of galloping hoofs Angels
NOTHING Cried Buddy in deep disgust and scuttled for the cabin

The cabin he knew as he ran was just then the worst place in the
world for a boy who wanted very much to go on living Through its gaping
doorway he saw a few odds and ends of food lying on the table but he
dared not stop long enough to get them The Indians were thundering down
to the corral and as he rounded the cabins corner he glanced back
and saw the foremost riders whipping their horses on the trail of the
fleeing white men But some he knew would stop Even the prospect of
fresh scalps could not hold the greedy ones from prowling around a white
mans dwelling place There might be tobacco or whiskey left behind
or something with color or a shine to it Buddy knew well the ways of
Indians

He made for the creek thinking at first to hide somewhere in the brush
along the bank Then fearing the brightening light of day and the wide
space he must cross to reach the first fringe of brush he stopped at a
dugout cellar that had been built into the creek bank above highwater
mark There was a poleanddirt roof and because the dirt sifted down
between the poles whenever the wind blewwhich was alwaysthe place
had been crudely sealed inside with split poles overlapping one another
The ceiling was more or less flat the roof had a slight slope In the
middle of the tiny attic thus formed Buddy managed to worm his body
through a hole in the gable next to the creek

He wriggled back to the end next the cabin and lay there very flat and
very quiet peeping out through a halfinch crack too wise in the ways
of silence to hold his breath until he must heave a sigh to relieve
his lungs It was hard to breathe naturally and easily after that swift
dash but somehow he did it An Indian had swerved and ridden behind the
cabin and was leaning and peering in all directions to see if anyone
had remained Perhaps he suspected an ambush Buddy was absolutely
certain that the fellow was looking for him personally and that he had
seen Buddy run toward the creek

It was not a pleasant thought and the fact that he knew that buck
Indian by name and had once traded him a jackknife for a beautifully
tanned wolf skin for his mother did not make it pleasanter
Hidestheface would not let past friendliness stand in the way of a
killing

Presently Hidestheface dismounted and tied his horse to a corner log
of the cabin and went inside with the others to see what he could find
that could be eaten or carried off Buddy saw fresh smoke issue from the
stone chimney and guessed that StepandaHalf had left something that
could be cooked It became evident in the course of an hour or so that
his presence was absolutely unsuspected and Buddy began to watch them
more composedly silently promising especial forms of punishment to this
one and that one whom he knew Most of them had been to the ranch many
times and he could have called to a dozen of them by name They had sat
in his fathers cabin or stood immobile just within the door and had
listened while his mother played and sang for them She had fed them
cakesBuddy remembered the good things which mother had given these
despicable ones who were looting and gobbling and destroying like a
drove of hogs turned loose in a garden and the thought of her wasted
kindness turned him sick with rage Mother had believed in their
friendliness Buddy wished that mother could see them setting fire
to the low log stable and the corral and swarming in and out of the
cabin

Painted for war they were with red stripes across their foreheads
ribs outlined in red which when they loosened their blankets as the
sun warmed them gave them a fantastic likeness to the skeletons Buddy
wished they were red stripes on their arms the number showing their
rank in the tribe openseated buckskin breeches to their knees where
they met the tightly wrapped leggings moccasins laced snugly at the
anklethey were picturesque enough to any eyes but Buddys He saw the
ghoulish greed in their eyes heard it in their voices when they shouted
to one another and he hated them even more than he feared them

Much that they said he understood They were cursing the Tomahawk
outfit chiefly because the men had not waited there to be surprised and
killed They cursed his father in particular and were half sorry that
they had not ridden on in pursuit with the others They hoped no white
man would ride alive to Laramie It made cheerful listening to Buddy
flat on his stomach in the roof of the dugout

After a while when the cabin had been gutted of everything it contained
save the crude table and benches a few Indians brought burning brands
from the stable and set it afire They were very busy inside and out
making sure that the flames took hold properly Then when the dry logs
began to blaze and flames licked the edges of the roof they stood back
and watched it

Buddy saw Hidestheface glance speculatively toward the dugout and
slipped his hand back where he could reach his sixshooter He felt
pretty certain that they meant to demolish the dugout next and he
knew exactly what he meant to do He had heard men at the posts talk of
selling their lives dearly  and that is what he intended to do

He was not going to be in too much of a hurry he would wait until they
actually began on the dugoutand when they were on the bank within a
few feet of him and he saw that there was no getting away from death
he meant to shoot five Indians and himself last of all

Tentatively he felt of his temple where he meant to place the muzzle
of the gun when there was just one bullet left It was so nice and
smoothhe wondered if God would really help him out if he said Our
Father with a pure heart and with faith as his mother said one must
pray He was slightly doubtful of both conditions when he came to think
of it seriously This spring he had felt grownup enough to swear a
little at the horses sometimesand he was not sure that shooting the
Indian that time would not be counted a crime by God who loved all
His creatures Mother always stuck to it that Injuns were Gods
creatureswhich brought Buddy squarely against the incredible
assumption that God must love them He did not in the least mean to be
irreverent but when he watched those painted bucks his opinion of God
changed slightly He decided that he himself was neither pure nor full
of faith and that he would not pray just yet He would let God go ahead
and do as He pleased about it except that Buddy would never let those
Indians get him alive no matter what God expected

Hidestheface walked over toward the dugout Buddy crooked his left arm
and laid the gun barrel across it to get a dead rest and leave nothing
to chance Hidestheface stared at the dugout moved to one sideand
the muzzle of the gun followed keeping its aim directly at the left
edge of his breastbone as outlined with the red paint Hidestheface
craned stepped into the path down the bank and passed out of range
Buddy gritted his teeth malevolently and waited his ears strained
to catch and interpret the meaning of every soft sound made by
Hidesthefaces moccasins

Hidestheface cautiously pushed open the door of the cellar and looked
in standing for interminable minutes as is the leisurely way of
Indians when there is no great need of haste Ruddy cautiously lowered
his face and peered down like a mouse from the thatch but he could not
handily bring his gun to bear upon Hidestheface who presently turned
back and went up the path his shouldermuscles moving snakishly under
his brown skin as he climbed the bank

Hidestheface returned to the others and announced that there was a
place where they could camp Buddy could not hear all that he said and
Hidestheface had his back turned so that not all of his signs were
intelligible but he gathered that these particular Indians had chosen
or had been ordered to wait here for three suns and that the cellar
appealed to Hidestheface as a shelter in case it stormed

Buddy did not know whether to rejoice at the news or to mourn They
would not destroy the dugout so he need not shoot himself which was of
course a relief Still three suns meant three days and nights and the
prospect of lying there on his stomach afraid to move for that length
of time almost amounted to the same thing in the end He did not
believe that he could hold out that long though of course he would try
pretty hard

All that day Buddy lay watching through the crack determined to take
any chance that came his way None came The Indians loitered in the
shade and some slept But always two or three remained awake and
although they sat apparently ready to doze off at any minute Buddy knew
them too well to hope for such good luck Two Indians rode in toward
evening dragging a calf that had been overlooked in the roundup and
having improvidently burned the cabin the meat was cooked over the
embers which still smouldered in places where knots in the logs made
slow fuel

Buddy watched them hungrily wondering how long it took to starve

When it was growing dark he tried to keep in mind the exact positions
of the Indians and to discover whether a guard would be placed over
the camp or whether they felt safe enough to sleep without a sentinel
Hidestheface he had long ago decided was in charge of the party and
Hidestheface was seemingly concerned only with gorging himself on
the halfroasted meat Buddy hoped he would choke himself but
Hidestheface was very good at gulping halfchewed hunks and finished
without disaster

Then he grunted something to someone in the dark and there was movement
in the group Buddy ground his growing second teeth together clenched
his fist and said Damn it three times in a silent crescendo of rage
because he could neither see nor hear what took place and immediately
he repented his profanity remembering that God could hear him
In Buddys opinion you never could be sure about God He bestowed
mysterious mercies and strange punishments and His ways were past
finding out Buddy tipped his palms together and repeated all the
prayers his mother had taught him and then with a flash of memory
finished with Oh God please just as mother had done long ago on the
dry drive After that he meditated uncomfortably for a few minutes
and added in a faint whisper Oh shucks You dont want to pay any
attention to a fellow cussing a little when hes mad I could easy make
that up if you helped me out some way

Buddy believed afterwards that God yielded to persuasion and decided to
give him a chance For not more than five minutes passed when a faroff
murmur grew to an indefinable roar and the wind whooped down off the
Snowies so fiercely that even the dugout quivered a little and rattled
dirt down on Buddy through the poles just over his head

At first this seemed an unlucky circumstance for the Indians came down
into the dugout for shelter and now Buddy was afraid to breathe in
the quiet intervals between the gusts Just below him he could hear the
occasional mutters of laconic sentences and grunted answers as the bucks
settled themselves for the night and he had a short panicky spell of
fearing that the poles would give way beneath him and drop him in upon
them

After a whileit seemed hours to Buddythe wind settled down to a
steady gale The Indians so far as he could determine were all asleep
in the cellar And Buddy setting his teeth hard together began to
slide slowly backward toward the opening through which he had crawled
into the roof When he had crawled in he had not noticed the springiness
of the poles but now his imagination tormented him with the sensation
of sagging and swaying When his feet pushed through the opening he had
to grit his teeth to hold himself steady It seemed as if someone were
reaching up in the dark to catch him by the legs and pull him out
Nothing happened however and after a little he inched backward until
he hung with his elbows hooked desperately inside the opening his head
and shoulders within and protesting with every nerve against leaving the
shelter

Buddy said afterwards that he guessed hed have hung there until
daylight only he was afraid it was about time to change guard and
somebody might catch him But he said he was scared to let go and drop
because it must have been pretty crowded in the cellar and he knew
the door was open and some buck might be roosting outside handy to be
stepped on But he knew he had to do something because if he ever went
to sleep up in that place hed snore maybe and anyway he said hed
rather run himself to death than starve to death So he dropped

It was two days after that when Buddy shuffled into a mining camp on
the ridge just north of Douglas Pass He was still on his feet but
they dragged like an old mans He had walked twentyfive miles in two
nights going carefully in fear of Indians The first five miles he had
waded along the shore of the creek he said in case they might pick up
his tracks at the dugout and try to follow him He had hidden himself
like a rabbit in the brush through the day and he had not dared shoot
any meat wherefore he had not eaten anything

I aint as hungry as I was at first He grinned tremulously But I
guess I bettereat I don wantto lose thehabit Then he went
slack and a man swearing to hide his pity picked him up in his arms and
carried him into the tent



CHAPTER SIX THE YOUNG EAGLE MUST FLY

Youre of age said Bob Birnie sucking hard at his pipe Youve had
your schooling as your mother wished that you should have it Youve
got the music in your head and your fingers and your toes and thats as
your mother wished that you should have

Your mother would have you be all for music and make tunes out of your
own head She tells me that you have made tunes and written them down on
paper and that there are those who would buy them and print copies to
sell with your name at the top of the page Ill not say what I think
of thatyour mother is an angel among women and she has taught you the
things she loves herself

But my business is with the cattle and Ive had you out with me since
you could climb on the back of a horse Ive watched you with the rope
and the irons and in the saddle and all Youve been in tight places
that would try the mettle of a man grownI mind the time ye escaped
Colorous band and we thought ye dead til ye came to us in Laramie
Youve showed that youre able to hold your own on the range lad Your
mothers all for the musicbut I leave it to you

Ten thousand dollars Ill give ye if thats your wish and you can go
to Europe as she wishes and study and make tunes for others to play Or
if ye prefer it Ill brand you a herd of she stock and let ye go your
ways No son of mine can take orders from his father after hes a man
grown and Im not to the age where I can sit with the pipe from morning
to night and let another run my outfit Ive talked it over with your
mother and shell bide by your decision as I shall do

So I put it in a nutshell Robert Youre twentyone today a man
grown and husky as theyre made Tis time you faced the world and
lived your life Youve been a good ladas lads go He stopped there
to rub his jaw thoughtfully perhaps remembering certain incidents
in Buddys fullflavored past Buddygrown to plain Bud among his
fellowsturned red without losing the line of hardness that had come to
his lips

Youre of legal age to be called a man and the futures before ye
Ill give ye five hundred cows with their calves beside themyou can
choose them yourself for youve a sharp eye for stockand you can go
where ye will Or Ill give ye ten thousand dollars and ye can go to
Europe and make tunes if youre a mind to And whatever ye choose itll
be make or break with ye Ye can sleep on the decision for Ive no wish
that ye should choose hastily and be sorry after

Buddygrown to Budlifted a booted foot and laid it across his other
knee and with his forefinger absently whirled the longpointed rower on
his spur The hardness at his lips somehow spread to his eyes that were
bent on the whirring rower It was the look that had come into the face
of the baby down on the Staked Plains when Ezra called and called after
he had been answered twice the look that had held firm the lips of the
boy who had lain very flat on his stomach in the roof of the dugout and
had watched the Utes burning the cabin

Theres no need to sleep on it he said after a minute Youve raised
me and spent some money on mebut Ive saved you a mans wages ever
since I was ten If you think Ive evened things up all right If you
dont make out your bill and Ill pay it when I can Theres no reason
why you should give me anything I havent earned just because youre my
father You earned all youve got and I guess I can do the same As you
say Im a man Ill go at the future man fashion And he added with a
slight flare of the nostrils Ill start in the morning

And is it to make tunes for other folks to play Bob Birnie asked after
a silence covertly eyeing him

No sir Theres more money in cattle Ill make my stake in the
cowcountry same as youve done He looked up and grinned a little
To the devil with your money and your shestock Ill get out all
rightbut Ill make my own way

Youre a stubborn fool Robert The Scotch now and then shows itself
like that in a man I got my start from my father and Im not ashamed of
it A thousand poundsand I brought it to America and to Texas and got
cattle

Bud laughed and got up hiding how the talk had struck deep into the
soul of him Then Ill go you one better dad Ill get my own start

Youll be back home in six months lad saying youve changed your
mind Bob Birnie predicted sharply stung by the tone of young Bud
That he added grimly or for a full belly and a clean bed to crawl
into

Bud stood licking the cigarette he had rolled to hide an unaccountable
trembling of his fingers When I come back Ill be in a position to buy
you out Ill borrow Skate and Maverick if you dont mind till I get
located somewhere He paused while he lighted the cigarette Its the
custom He reminded his father unnecessarily to furnish a man a horse
to ride and one to pack his bed when hes fired

Yeve horses of yer own Bob Birnie retorted and youve no need to
borrow

Bud stood looking down at his father plainly undecided I dont know
whether theyre mine or not he said after a minute I dont know what
it cost you to raise me Figure it up if you havent already and count
the time Ive worked for you Since youve put me on a business basis
like raising a calf to shipping age lets be businesslike about it You
are good at figuring your profitsIll leave it to you And if you find
Ive anything coming to me besides my riding outfit and the clothes Ive
got all right Ill take horses for the balance

He walked off with the swing to his shoulders that had always betrayed
him when he was angry and Bob Birnie gathered his beard into a handful
and held it while he stared after him It had been no part of his plan
to set his son adrift on the range without a dollar but since Buds
temper was up it might be a good thing to let him go

So Bob Birnie went away to confer with his wife and Bud was left alone
to nurse his hurt while he packed his few belongings It did hurt him to
be told in that calm coldblooded manner that now he was of legal age
he would not be expected to stay on at the Tomahawk Until his father
had spoken to him about it Bud had not thought much about what he would
do when his school days were over He had taken life as it was presented
to him week by week month by month He had fulfilled his mothers hopes
and had learned to make music He had lived up to his fathers unspoken
standards of a cowman He had made a Hand ever since his legs were
long enough to reach the stirrups of a saddle There was not a better
rider not a better roper on the range than Bud Birnie Morally he
was cleaner than most young fellows of his age He hated trickery he
reverenced all good women the bad ones he pitied because he believed
that they sorrowed secretly because they were not good because they
had missed somehow their real purpose in life which was to be wife and
mother He had in fact grown up clean and true to type He was Buddy
grown to be Bud

And Buddy now that he was a man had been told that he was not expected
to stay at home and help his father and be a comfort to his mother He
was like a young eagle which having grown wingfeathers that will bear
the strain of high air currents has been pecked out of the nest No
doubt the young eagle resents his unexpected banishment although in
time he would have felt within himself the urge to go Leave Bud alone
and soon or late he would have goneperhaps with compunctions against
leaving home and the feeling that he was somehow a disappointment to
his parents He would have explained to his father apologized to his
mother As it was he resented the alacrity with which his father was
pushing him out

So he packed his clothes that night and pushed his guitar into its case
and buckled the strap with a vicious yank and went off to the bunkhouse
to eat supper with the boys instead of sitting down to the table where
his mother had placed certain dishes which Buddy loved bestwanting to
show in true woman fashion her love and sympathy for him

Laterit was after Bud had gone to bedmother came and had a long talk
with him She was very sweet and sensible and Bud was very tender with
her But she could not budge him from his determination to go and make
his way without a Birnie dollar to ease the beginning Other men had
started with nothing and had made a stake and there was no reason why
he could not do so

Dad put it straight enough and its no good arguing Id starve before
Id take anything from him Im entitled to my clothes and maybe a
horse or two for the work Ive done for him while I was growing up Ive
figured out pretty close what it cost to put me through the University
and what I was worth to him during the summers Fathers Scotchbut
he isnt a darned bit more Scotch than I am mother Putting it all
in dollars and cents I think Ive earned more than I cost him In the
winters I know I earned my board doing chores and riding line Many a
little bunch of stock Ive saved for him by getting out in the foothills
and driving them down below heavy snowline before a storm You remember
the bunch of horses I found by watching the magpiesthe time we tied
hay in canvas and took it up to them til they got strength enough to
follow the trail I trampled in the snow I earned my board and more
every winter since I was ten So I dont believe I owe dad a cent when
its all figured out

But youve done for me what money cant repay mother Ill always be
in debt to youand Ill square it by being the kind of a man youve
tried to teach me to be I will mother Dad and the dollars are a
different matter The debt I owe you will never be paid but Im going
to make you glad I know theres a debt I believe theres a God because
I know there must have been one to make you And no matter how far away
I may drift in miles your Buddy is going to be here with you always
mother learning from you all there is of goodness and sweetness He
held her two hands against his face and she felt his cheeks wet beneath
her palms Then he took them away and kissed them many times like a
lover

If I ever have a wife shes going to have her work cut out for her
He laughed unsteadily Shell have to live up to you mother if she
wants me to love her

If you have a wife shell be wellspoiled young man Perhaps it is
wise that you should gobut dont you forget your music Buddyand be
a good boy and remember mothers going to follow you with her love and
her faith in you and her prayers

It may have been that Buddys baby memory of going north whenever the
trail herd started remained to send Bud instinctively northward when he
left the Tomahawk next morning It had been a case of stubborn father
and stubborn son dickering politely over the net earnings of the son
from the time when he was old enough to leave his mothers lap and climb
into a saddle to ride with his father Three horses and his personal
belongings had been agreed upon between them as the balance in Buds
favor and at that Bob Birnie dryly remarked he had been a better
investment as a son than most young fellows who cost more than they
were worth to raise

Bud did not answer the implied praise but roped the Tomahawks best
three horses out of the REMUDA corralled for him by his fathers riders
You should have seen the sidelong glances among the boys when they
learned that Bud just home from the University was going somewhere
with all his earthly possessions and a look in his face that meant
trouble

Two big valises and his blankets he packed on Sunfish a deceptively
rawboned young buckskin with much white showing in his eyesan ornery
looking brute if ever there was one Buds guitar and a mandolin in
their cases he tied securely on top of the pack Smoky the second
horse a deepchested mouse with a face almost human in its
expression he saddled and put a lead rope on the third a bay
fouryearold called Stopper which was the Tomahawks best ropehorse
and one that would be missed when fast work was wanted in branding

He sure as hell picked himself three top hawses a tall puncher
murmured to another Wonder where hes headed for Not reppingthis
late in the season

Bud overheard them and gave no sign Had they asked him directly he
could not have told them for he did not know except that somehow
he felt that he was going to head north Why north he could not have
explained since cowcountry lay all around him nor how far northfor
cowcountry extended to the upper boundary of the States and beyond
into Canada

He left his horses standing by the corral while he went to the house to
tell his mother goodby and to send a farewell message to Dulcie
who had been married a year and lived in Laramie He did not expect to
strike Laramie he told his mother when she asked him

Im going till I stop He explained with a squeeze of her shoulders
to reassure her I guess its the way you felt mother when you left
Texas behind You couldnt tell where you folks would wind up Neither
can I My trail herd is kinda small right now a lot smaller than it
will be later on But such as it is its going to hit the right range
before it stops for good And Ill write

He took a doughnut in his hand and a package of lunch to slip in his
pocket kissed her with much cheerfulness in his manner and hurried out
his bigrowelled spurs burring on the porch just twice before he stepped
off on the gravel Telling mother goodby had been the one ordeal he
dreaded and he was glad to have it over with

Old StepandaHalf hailed him as he went past the chuckhouse and came
limping out wiping his hands on his apron before he shook hands and
wished him good luck Ezra pottering around the tool shed ambled up
with the eyes of a dog that has been sent back home by his master
Ah shoah do wish yo all good fawtune an health Marse Buddy Ezra
quavered Ah shoah do It ain goin seem lak de same placeand Ah
shoah do hopes yo all writes frequent lettahs to yo mothah boy

Bud promised that he would and managed to break away from Ezra without
betraying himself How he wondered did everyone seem to know that he
was going for good this time He had believed that no one knew of it
save himself his father and his mother yet everyone else behaved as
if they never expected to see him again It was disconcerting and Bud
hastily untied the two led horses and mounted Smoky the mousecolored
horse he himself had broken two years before

His father came slowly up to him straightbacked and with the gait of
the man who has ridden astride a horse more than he has walked on his
own feet He put up his hand gloved for riding and Bud changed the
leadropes from his right hand to his left and shook hands rather
formally

Yeve good weather for travelling said Bob Birnie tentatively I
have not said it before lad but when ye own yourself a fool to take
this way of making your fortune ten thousand dollars will still be
ready to start ye right Ive no wish to shirk a duty to my family

Bud pressed his lips together while he listened If you keep your ten
thousand till its called for youll be drawing interest a long time on
it He said Its going to be hot today Ill be getting along

He lifted the reins glanced back to see that the two horses were
showing the proper disposition to follow and rode off down the
deeprutted road that followed up the creek to the pass where he had
watched the Utes dancing the war dance one night that he remembered
well If he winced a little at the familiar landmarks he passed
he still held fast to the determination to go and to find fortune
somewhere along the trail of his own making and to ask help from no
man least of all his father who had told him to go



CHAPTER SEVEN BUD FLIPS A COIN WITH FATE

I dont think it matters so much where we light its what we do when
we get there said Bud to Smoky his horse one day as they stopped
where two roads forked at the base of a great outstanding peak that was
but the point of a mountain range This trail straddles the butte and
takes on up two different valleys Its all cowcountryso what do yuh
say Smoke Which trail looks the best to you

Smoky flopped one ear forward and the other one back and switched at a
pestering fly Behind him Sunfish and Stopper waited with the patience
they had learned in three weeks of continuous travel over country that
was rough in spots barren in places with wind and sun and occasional
sudden thunderstorms to punctuate the daily grind of travel

Bud drew a half dollar from his pocket and regarded it meditatively
Theyre going fastwell just naturally have to stop pretty soon or
we dont eat He observed Smoke youre a quitter What you want to
do is go backbut you wont get the chance Heads we take the right
hand trail I like it better anywayit angles more to the north

Heads it was and Bud leaned from the saddle and recovered the coin
Smoky turning his head to regard his rider tolerantly Right hand
goesand we camp at the first good water and grass I can grain the
three of you once more before we hit a town and that goes for me too
Gwan Smoke and dont act so mournful

Smoky went on following the trail that wound in and out around the
butte hugging close its sheer sides to avoid a fiftyfoot drop into the
creek below It was new countryBud had never so much as seen a map
of it to give him a clue to what was coming The last turn of the
deeprutted sandy road where it left the rivers bank and led straight
between two humpy shoulders of rock to the foot of a plattershaped
valley brought him to a halt again in sheer astonishment

From behind a low hill still farther to the right where the road forked
again a bluish haze of smoke indicated that there was a town of
some sort perhaps Farther up the valley a brownish cloud hung lowa
roundup Bud knew at a glance He hesitated The town if it were a
town could wait the roundup might not And a job he must have soon or
go hungry He turned and rode toward the dustcloud came shortly to a
small stream and a green grassplot and stopped there long enough to
throw the pack off Sunfish unsaddle Smoky and stake them both out to
graze Stopper he saddled then knelt and washed his face beat the
travel dust off his hat untied his rope and coiled it carefully
untied his handkerchief and shook it as clean as he could and knotted it
closely again One might have thought he was preparing to meet a girl
but the habit of neatness dated back to his pinkapron days and beyond
the dirt and dust meant discomfort

When he mounted Stopper and loped away toward the dustcloud he rode
hopefully sure of himself carrying his range credentials in his eyes
in his perfect saddlepoise in the tan on his face to his eyebrows and
the womanish softness of his gloved hands which had all the sensitive
flexibility of a musician

His main hope was that the outfit was working shorthanded and when he
rode near enough to distinguish the herd and the riders he grinned his
satisfaction

Good cowcountry by the look of that bunch of cattle He observed
to himself And eight men is a small crew to work a herd that size I
guess Ill tie onto this outfit Stopper youll maybe get a chance to
turn a cow this afternoon

Just how soon the chance would come Bud had not realized He had no
more than come within shouting distance of the herd when a big rollicky
steer broke from the milling cattle and headed straight out past him
running like a deer Stopper famed and named for his prowess with just
such cattle wheeled in his tracks and lengthened his stride to a run

Tie im down someone yelled behind Bud And Catch im and tie im
down shouted another

For answer Bud waved his hand and reached in his pocket for his knife
Stopper was artfully circling the steer forcing it back toward the
herd and in another hundred yards or so Bud must throw his loop He
sliced off a saddlestring and took it between his teeth jerked his
rope loose flipped open the loop as Stopper raced up alongside dropped
the noose neatly and took his turns while Stopper planted his forefeet
and braced himself for the shock Buds right leg was over the cantle
all his weight on the left stirrup when the jerk came and the steer fell
with a thump By good luckso Bud afterwards assertedhe was off and
had the steer tied before it had recovered its breath to scramble up
He remounted flipped off the loop and recoiled his rope while he went
jogging up to meet a rider coming out to him

If he expected thanks for what he had done he must have received a
shock Other riders had left their posts and were edging up to hear
what happened and Bud reined up in astonishment before the most amazing
string of unseemly epithets he had ever heard It began with Whatd
you throw that critter forwhich of course is putting it mildlyand
ended in a choked phrase which one man may not use to anothers face and
expect anything but trouble afterwards

Bud unbuckled his gun and hung the belt on his saddle horn and
dismounted Get off your horse and take the damnedest licking you ever
had in your life for that He invited vengefully You told me to
tie down that steer and I tied him down Youve got no call to
complainand there isnt a man on earth Ill take that kinda talk
from Crawl down you parrotfaced coweaterand leave your gun on the
saddle

The man remained where he was and looked Bud over uncertainly Who are
you and whered yuh come from he demanded more calmly I never saw
yuh before

Well I never grew up with your face before me either Bud snapped
If I had Id probably be crosseyed by now You called me something
Get off that horse or Ill pull you off

Aw yuh dont want to mind began a tall lean man pacifically but
he of the high nose stopped him with a wave of the hand his eyes still
measuring the face the form and the fighting spirit of one Bud Birnie
standing with his coat off quivering with rage

I guess Im in the wrong young fellowI DID holler Tie im down
But if youd ever been around this outfit any you d have known I didnt
mean it literal He stopped and suddenly he laughed Ive been yellin
Tie im down for two years and more when a critter breaks outa the
bunch and nobody was ever fool enough to tackle it before Its just a
sayin weve got young man We

What about the name you called me Bud was still advancing slowly not
much appeased by the explanation I dont give a darn about the steer
You said tie him and hes tied But when you call me

My mistake young feller When I get riled up I dont pick my words
He eyed Bud sharply Youre mighty quick to obey orders He added
tentatively

I was brought up to do as Im told Bud retorted stiffly Any
objections to make

Not one in the world Wish there was more like yuh You aint been in
these parts long His tone made a question of the statement

Not right here Bud had no reason save his temper for not giving
more explicit information but Bart Nelsonas Bud knew him
afterwardscontinued to study him as if he suspected a blotched past

Hunh That your horse

Ive got a bill of sale for him

You dont happen to be wanting a job I spose

I wouldnt refuse to take one And then the twinkle came back to Buds
eyes because all at once the whole incident struck him as being rather
funny Id want a boss that expected to have his orders carried out
though I lack imagination and I never did try to read a mans mind
What he says hed better meanwhen he says it to me

Bart Nelson gave a short laugh turned and sent his riders back to their
work with oaths tingling their ears Bud judged that cursing was his
natural form of speech

Go let up that steer and Ill put you to work he said to Bud
afterwards Thats a good rope horse youre riding If you want to use
him and if you can hold up to that little sample of roping yuh gave
us Ill pay yuh sixty a month And thats partly for doing what youre
told he added with a quick look into Buds eyes You didnt say where
youre from

I was born and raised in cowcountry and nobodys looking for me
Bud informed him over his shoulder while he remounted and let it go at
that From southern Wyoming to Idaho was too far he reasoned to make
it worth while stating his exact place of residence If they had never
heard of the Tomahawk outfit it would do no good to name it If they had
heard of it they would wonder why the son of so rich a cowman as Bob
Birnie should be hiring out as a common cowpuncher so far from home He
had studied the matter on his way north and had decided to let people
form their own conclusions If he could not make good without the name
of Bob Birnie behind him the sooner he found it out the better

He untied the steer drove it back into the herd and rode over to where
the highnosed man was helping hold the Cut

Can you read brands Were cuttin out AJ and AJBar stuff left
earcrop on the AJ and undercut on the AJBar

Bud nodded and eased into the herd spied an AJ twoyearold and urged
it toward the outer edge smiling to himself when he saw how Stopper
kept his nose close to the animals rump Once in the milling fringe of
the herd Stopper nipped it into the open rushed it to the cut herd
wheeled and went back of his own accord From the corner of his eye as
he went Bud saw that Bart Nelson and one or two others were watching
him They continued to eye him covertly while he worked the herd with
two other men He was glad that he had not travelled far that day
and that he had ridden Smoky and left Stopper fresh and eager for his
favorite pastime which was making cattle do what they particularly did
not want to do In that he was adept and it pleased Bud mightily to see
how much attention Stopper was attracting

Not once did it occur to him that it might be himself who occupied the
thoughts of his boss Buddyafterwards Budhad lived his whole life
among friends his only enemies the Indians who preyed upon the cowmen
White men he had never learned to distrust and to be distrusted had
never been his portion He had always been Bud Birnie son and heir of
Bob Birnie as cleanhanded a cattle king as ever recorded a brand Even
at the University his position had been accepted without question That
the man he mentally called Parrotface was puzzled and even worried about
him was the last thing he would think of

But it was true Bart Nelson watched Bud that afternoon A man might
ride up to Bart and assert that he was an old hand with cattle and Bart
would say nothing but set him to work as he had Bud Then he would
know just how old a Hand the fellow was Fifteen minutes convinced
him that Bud had growed up in the saddle as he would have put it But
that only mystified him the more Bart knew the range and he knew every
man in the country from Burroback Valley which was this great valleys
name to the Black Rim beyond the mountain range and beyond the Black
Rim to the Sawtooth country He knew their ways and he knew their past
records

He knew that this young fellow came from farther ranges and he would
have been at a loss to explain just how he knew it He would have said
that Bud did not have the earmarks of an Idaho rider Furthermore the
small Tomahawk brand on the left flank of the horse Bud rode was totally
unknown to Bart Yet the horse did not bear the marks of long riding
Bud himself looked as if he had just ridden out from some nearby
ranchand he had refused to say where he was from

Bart swore under his breath and beckoned to him a droopymustached
droopyshouldered rider who was circling the herd in a droopy
spiritless manner and chewing tobacco with much industry

Dirk you know brands from the Panhandle to Cypress Hills What d yuh
make of that horse Where does he come from Bart stopped abruptly and
rode forward then to receive and drive farther back a galloping AJBar
cow which Bud and Stopper had just hazed out of the herd Dirk squinted
at Stoppers brand which showed cleanly in the glossy new hair of early
summer He spat carefully with the wind and swung over to meet his boss
when the cow was safely in the cut herd

New one on me Bart Theys a hatchet brand over close to Jacksons
Hole somewhere Whered the kid say he was from

He wouldnt say but hes a sureenough cowhand

That there horse aint been rode down on no long journey Dirk
volunteered after further scrutiny And he added with the unconscious
impertinence of an old and trusted employee Yuh goin to put him on

Already done itsixty a month Bart confided Thatll bring out
whats in him hes liable to turn out good for the outfit Showed hell
do what hes told first and think it over afterwards I like that there
trait in a man

Dirk pulled his droopy mustache away from his lips as if he wanted to
make sure that his smile would show though it was not a pretty smile
on account of his tobaccostained teeth

S your funral Bart Id say hes from Jacksons Hole on a rough
guessbut I wouldnt presume to guess what hes here fur Mebby he come
across from Black Rim I can find out if you say so

Bud was weaving in and out through the herd scanning the animals
closely While the two talked he singled out a yearling heifer let
Stopper nose it out beyond the bunch and drove it close to the boss

Better look that one over He called out One way it looks like AJ
and another way I couldnt name it And the ear looks as if about half
of it had been frozen off Didnt want to run it into the cut until you
passed on it

Bart looked first at Bud and he looked hard Then he rode over and
inspected the yearling Dirk close at his heels

Throw er back with the bunch He ordered

That finishes the cut then Bud announced rubbing his hand along
Stoppers sweaty neck I kept passing this critter up and I guess the
other boys did the same But its the last one and I thought Id run
her out for you to look over

Bart grunted Dirk you take a look and see if theyve got em all And
you Kid can help haze the cut up the Flatthe boysll show you what
to do

Bud remembering Smoky and Sunfish and his camp hesitated Ive got
a camp down here by the creek He said If its all the same to you
Ill report for work in the morning if youll tell me where to head
for And Ill have to arrange somehow to pasture my horses Ive got a
couple more at camp

Bart studied him for a minute and Bud thought he was going to change
his mind about the job or the sixty dollars a month But Bart merely
told him to ride on up the Flat next morning and take the first trail
that turned to the left The Muleshoe ranch is up there agin that pine
mountain he explained Bring along your outfit I guess we can take
care of a couple of horses all right

That suited Bud very well and he rode away thinking how lucky he was to
have taken the right fork in the road that day He had ridden straight
into a job and while he was not very enthusiastic over the boss the
other boys seemed all right and the wages were a third more than he
had expected to get just at first It was the first time he reminded
himself that he had been really tempted to locate and he certainly had
struck it lucky

He did not know that when he left the roundup his going had been
carefully noted and that he was no sooner out of sight than Dirk Tracy
was riding cautiously on his trail While he fed his horses the last bit
of grain he had and cooked his supper over what promised to be his last
campfire he did not dream that the man with the droopy mustache was
lying amongst the bushes on the other bank of the creek watching every
move he made

He meant to be up before daylight so that he could strike the ranch
of the Muleshoe outfit in time for breakfast wherefore he went to bed
before the afterglow had left the mountaintops around him And being
young and carefree and healthfully weary he was asleep and snoring
gently within five minutes of his last wriggle into his blankets But
Dirk Tracy watched him for fully two hours before he decided that the
kid was not artfully pretending but was really asleep and likely to
remain so for the night

Dirk was an extremely cautious man but he was also tired and the cold
food he had eaten in place of a hot supper had not been satisfying to
his stomach He crawled carefully out of the brush stole up the creek
to where he had left his horse and rode away

He was not altogether sure that he had done his full duty to the
Muleshoe but it was against human nature for a man nearing forty to
lie uncovered in the brush and let a numerous family of mosquitoes feed
upon him while he listened to a young man snoring comfortably in a good
camp bed a hundred feet away

Dirk because his conscience was not quite clear slept in the stable
that night and told his boss a lie next morning



CHAPTER EIGHT THE MULESHOE

The riders of the Muleshoe outfit were eating breakfast when Bud rode
past the long lowroofed log cabin to the corral which stood nearest
the clutter of stables and sheds He stopped there and waited to see if
his new boss was anywhere in sight and would come to tell him where to
unpack his belongings A sandy complexioned young man with red eyelids
and no lashes presently emerged from the stable and came toward him
his mouth sagging loosely open his eye vacuous He was clad in faded
overalls turned up a foot at the bottom and showing frayed shoddy
trousers beneath and rusty rundown shoes that proved he was not a
rider His hat was peppered with little holes as if someone had fired a
charge of birdshot at him and had all but bagged him

The youths eyes became fixed upon the guitar and mandolin cases roped
on top of Sunfishs pack and he pointed and gobbled something which had
the sound speech without being intelligible Bud cocked an ear toward
him inquiringly made nothing of the jumble and rode off to the cabin
leading Sunfish after him The fellow might or might not be the idiot he
looked and he might or might not keep his hands off the pack Bud was
not going to take any chance

He heard sounds within the cabin but no one appeared until he shouted
Hello twice The door opened then and Bart Nelson put out his head
his jaws working over a mouthful of food that seemed tough

Oh its you Cm awn in an eat he invited and Bud dismounted
never guessing that his slightest motion had been carefully observed
from the time he had forded the creek at the foot of the slope beyond
the cabin

Bart introduced him to the men by the simple method of waving his hand
at the group around the table and saying Guess you know the boys
Whatd yuh say we could call yuh

BudahBirnie Bud answered swiftly weighing the romantic idea of
using some makeshift name until he had made his fortune and deciding
against it A false name might mean future embarrassment and he was so
far from home that his father would never hear of him anyway But his
hesitation served to convince every man there that Birnie was not his
name and that he probably had good cause for concealing his own Adding
that to Dirk Tracys guess that he was from Jacksons Hole the sum
spelled outlaw

The Muleshoe boys were careful not to seem curious about Buds past
They even refrained from manifesting too much interest in the musical
instruments until Bud himself took them out of their cases that evening
and began tuning them Then the halfbaked tonguetied fellow came over
and gobbled at him eagerly

Hen wants yuh to play something a man they called Day interpreted
Hens loco on music If you can sing and play both Henll set and
listen till plumb daylight and never move an eyewinker

Bud looked up smiled a little because Hen had no eyewinkers to move
and suddenly felt pity because a man could be so altogether unlikeable
as Hen Also because his mothers face stood vividly before him for
an instant leaving him with a queer tightening of the throat and
the feeling that he had been rebuked He nodded to Hen laid down the
mandolin and picked up the guitar turned up the a string a bit laid
a booted and spurred foot across the other knee plucked a minor chord
sonorously and began abruptly

Yo kin talk about you coons ahavin troubleWell Ah think Ah have
enougha of mah ohown

Hens highpointed Adams apple slipped up and down in one great gulp of
ecstasy He eased slowly down upon the edge of the bunk beside Bud and
gazed at him fascinatedly his lashless eyes never winking his jaw
dropped so that his mouth hung half open Day nudged Dirk Tracy who
parted his droopy mustache and smiled his unlovely smile lowering his
left eyelid unnecessarily at Bud The dimple in Buds chin wrinkled as
he bent his head and plunked the interlude with a swing that set spurred
boots tapping the floor rhythmically

Bart hes went and hired a showactor looks like Dirk confided
behind his hand to Shorty McGuire Thats real singin if yuh ask me

Shut up grunted Shorty and prodded Dirk into silence so that he
would miss none of the song

Since Buddy had left the pinkapron stage of his adventurous life behind
him singing songs to please other people had been as much a part of his
life as riding and roping and eating and sleeping He had always sung or
played or danced when he was asked to do soaccepting without question
his mothers doctrine that it was unkind and illbred to refuse when he
really could do those things well because on the cattle ranges indoor
amusements were few and those who could furnish real entertainment were
fewer Even at the University coon songs and Irish songs and love songs
had been his portion wherefore his repertoire seemed endless and if
folks insisted upon it he could sing from dark to dawn providing his
voice held out

Hen sat with his bigjointed hands hanging loosely over his knees and
listened stared at Bud and grinned vacuously when one song was done
gulped his Adams apple and listened again as raptly to the next one
The others forgot all about having fun watching Hen and named old
favorites and new ones heard them sung inimitably and called for more
At midnight Bud blew on his blistered fingertips and shook the guitar
gently bottomside up

I guess thats all the music there is in the darned thing tonight he
lamented Shes made to keep time and she always strikes along about
midnight

Huhhuh chortled Hen convulsively as if he understood the joke He
closed his mouth and sighed deeply as one who has just wakened from a
trance

After that Hen followed Bud around like a pet dog and found time
between stable chores to groom those astonished horses Stopper and
Smoky and Sunfish as if they were stallkept thoroughbreds He had them
coming up to the pasture gate every day for the few handfuls of grain he
purloined for them and their sleekness was a joy to behold

Hen hes adopted yuh horses and all looks like Dirk observed one
day to Bud when they were riding together And he tempered the statement
by adding that Hen was trusty enough even if he didnt have as much
sense as the law allows He sure is takin care of them cayuses of
yourn Dyou tell him to

Bud came out of a homesick revery and looked at him inquiringly No I
didnt tell him anything

I believe that all right Dirk retorted You dont go around tellin
all yuh know I like that in a feller A man never got into trouble
yet by keepin his mouth shut but theres plenty that have talked
themselves into the pen Me Ive got no use for a talker

Bud sent him a sidelong glance of inquiry and Dirk caught him at it and
grinned

Yuh been here a month and you aint said a damn word about where you
come from or anything further back than throwin and tyin that critter
You said cowcountry and that has had to do some folks that might be
curious Well shes a tearin big placecowcountry She runs from
Canady to Mexico and from the corn belt to the Pacific Ocean mighty
near takes in Jacksons Hole and a lot uh country I know He parted
his mustache and spat carefully into the sand Im willin to tie to a
man specially a young feller that can play the game the way you been
playin it Bud Most always he complained vaguely they carry
their brand too damn main They either pull their hats down past their
eyebrows and give everybody the bad eye or else theyre too damn ready
to lie about themselves You throw in with the boys just finebut you
aint told a one of em where you come from ner why ner nothin

Im here because Im here Bud chanted softly his eyes stubborn even
while he smiled at Dirk

I knowyuh sung that the first night yuh come and yuh looked straight
at the boss all the while you was singin it Dirk interrupted and
laughed slyly The boys they took that all in too And Bart he
wasnt asleep neither You sure are smooth as they make em Bud I
guess he leaned closer to predict confidentially youve just about
passed the probation time young feller If I know the signs the boss
is gittin ready to raise yuh

He looked at Bud rather sharply Instantly the training of Buddy rose
within Bud His memory flashed back unerringly to the day when he had
watched that Indian gallop toward the river and had sneered because the
Indian evidently expected him to follow into the undergrowth

Dirk Tracy did not in the least resemble an Indian nor did his rambling
flattery bear any likeness to a fleeing enemy yet it was plain enough
that he was trying in a bungling way to force Buds confidence and for
that reason Bud stared straight ahead and said nothing

He did not remember having sung that particular ditty during his first
evening at the Muleshoe nor of staring at the boss while he sung He
might have done both he reflected he had sung one song after another
for about four hours that night and unless he sang with his eyes shut
he would have to look somewhere That it should be taken by the
whole outfit as a broad hint to ask no questions seemed to him rather
farfetched

Nor did he see why Dirk should compliment him on keeping his mouth
shut or call him smooth He did not know that he had been on probation
except perhaps as that applied to his ability as a cowhand And he
could see no valid reason why the boss should contemplate raising him
So far he had been doing no more than the rest of the boys except
when there was roping to be done and he and Stopper were called upon
to distinguish themselves by fast ropework with never a miss Sixty
dollars a month was as good pay as he had any right to expect

Dirk he decided had given him one good tip which he would follow at
once Dirk had said that no man ever got into trouble by keeping his
mouth shut Bud closed his for a good half hour and when he opened it
again he undid all the good he had accomplished by his silence

Where does that trail go that climbs up over the mountains back of
that peak he asked Seems to be a stock trail Have you got grazing
land beyond the mountains

Dirk took time to pry off a fresh chew of tobacco before he replied
You mean Thunder Pass That there crosses over into the Black Rim
country YeahTheres a big wide range country over there but we dont
run any stock on it Burroback Valleys big enough for the Muleshoe

Bud rolled a cigarette I didnt mean that main trail thats a wagon
road and Thunder Pass cuts through between Sheepeater peak and this one
ahead of usGospel you call it What I referred to is that blind trail
that takes off up the canyon behind the corrals and crosses into the
mountains the other side of Gospel

Dirk eyed him I dunno s I could say right offhand what trail yuh
mean he parried Every canyon s got a trail that runs up a ways and
theres canyons all through the mountains they all lead up to water or
feed or something like that and then quit most genrally jest peter
out like And he added with heavy sarcasm A feller thats lived
on the range oughta know what trails is for and how theyre made
Cowcritters are curioussame as humans

To this Bud did not reply He was smoking and staring at the brushy
lower slopes of the mountain ridge before them He had explained quite
fully which trail he meant It was as he had said a blind trail
that is the trail lost itself in the creek which watered a string of
corrals Moreover Bud had very keen eyes and he had seen how a panel
of the corral directly across the shalerock bed of a small stream was
really a set of bars The round pole corral lent itself easily to hidden
gateways without any deliberate attempt at disguising their presence

The string of four corrals running from this upper onewhich
he remembered was not seen from nearer the stableswas perhaps a
convenient arrangement in the handling of stock although it was
unusual The upper corral had been built to fit snugly into a rocky
recess in the base of the peak called Gospel It was larger than some
of the others since it followed the contour of the basinlike recess
Access to it was had from the fourth corral which from the ranch
appeared to be the last and from the creekbed that filled the narrow
mouth of the canyon behind

Dirk might not have understood him Bud thought He certainly should
have recognized at once the trail Bud meant for there was no other
canyon back of the corrals and even that one was not apparent to one
looking at the face of the steep slope Stock had been over that canyon
trail within the last month or so however and Buds inference that the
Muleshoe must have grazing ground across the mountains was natural the
obvious explanation of its existence

How d you come to be explorin around Gospel anyway Dirk quizzed
finally A persond think shorthanded as the Muleshoe is this spring
t youd git all the ridin yuh want without prognosticatin around
aimless

Now Bud was not a suspicious young man and he had been no more than
mildly inquisitive about that trail But neither was he a fool he
caught the emphasis which Dirk had placed on the word aimless and his
thoughts paused and took another look at Dirks whole conversation
There was something queer about it something which made Bud sheer off
from his usual unthinking assurance that things were just what they
seemed

Immediately however he laughedat himself as well as at Dirk

Weve been feeding on sour bread and warmedover coffee ever since the
cook disappeared and Bart put Hen in the kitchen he said If I were
you Dirk I wouldnt blister my hands shovelling that grub into myself
for a while Youre bilious oldtimer No man on earth would talk the
way youve been talking today unless his whole digestive apparatus were
out of order

Dirk spat angrily at a dead sage bush They shore as hell wouldnt talk
the kinda talk youve been talkie unless they was a born fool or else
huntin trouble he retorted venomously

The doctor said Id be that way if I lived Bud grinned amiably
although his face had flushed at Dirks tone He said it wouldnt hurt
me for work

Yeahand what kinda work Dirk rode so close that his horse
shouldered Buds leg discomfortingly I been edgin yuh along to see
whatfr brand yuh carried And Ive got ye now you damned snoopin
kioty Bart he hired yuh to workand not to go prowling around lookin
up trails that aint there

Youre a dimbrand reader I dont think Why you

Oh wellremember that Bud was only Buddy grown bigger and he had
never lacked the spirit to look out for himself Remember too that
he must have acquired something of a vocabulary in the course
of twentyone years of absorbing everything that came within his
experience

Dirk reached for his gun but Bud was expecting that Dirk was not quite
quick enough and his hand therefore came forward with a jerk when he
saw that he was covered Bud leaned pulled Dirks sixshooter from
its holster and sent it spinning into a clump of bushes He snatched a
wickedlooking knife from Dirks boot where he had once seen Dirk slip
it sheathed when he dressed in the bunkhouse and sent that after the
gun

Now you longeared walrus youre in a position to play fair What are
you going to do about it He reined away out of Dirks reach took his
handkerchief and wrapped his own gun tightly to protect it from sand
and threw it after Dirks gun and the knife Am I a snooping coyote
he demanded watching Dirk

You air More n all that youre a damned spy And I kin lick yuh an
lass yuh an lead yuh to Bart like a sheep

They dismounted left their horses to stand with reins dropped threw
off their coats and fought until they were too tired to land another
blow There were no fatalities Bud did not come out of the fray
unscathed and proudly conscious of his strength and his skill and the
unquestionable righteousness of his cause Instead he had three bruised
knuckles and a rapidly swelling ear and when his anger had cooled a
little he felt rather foolish and wondered what had started them off
that way They had ridden away from the ranch in a very good humor and
he had harbored no conscious dislike of Dirk Tracy who had been one
individual of a type of rangemen which he had known all his life and had
accepted as a matter of course

Dirk on his part had some trouble in stopping the bleeding of his
nose and by the time he reached the ranch his left eye was closed
completely He was taller and heavier than Bud and he had not expected
such a slugging strength behind Buds blows

He was badly shaken and when Bud recovered the two guns and the knife
and returned his weapons to him Dirk was half tempted to shoot But he
did notperhaps because Bud had unwrapped his own sixshooter and
was looking it over with the muzzle slanting a wicked eye in Dirks
direction

Late that afternoon when the boys were loafing around the cabin waiting
for their early supper Bud packed his worldly goods on Sunfish and
departed from the Muleshoeby special request he admitted to
himself ruefullywith his wages in gold and silver in his pocket and no
definite idea of what he would do next

He wished he knew exactly why Bart had fired him He did not believe
that it was for fighting as Bart had declared He thought that perhaps
Dirk Tracy had some hold on the Muleshoe not apparent to the outsider
and that he had lied about him to Bart as a sneaking kind of revenge
for being whipped But that explanation did not altogether satisfy him
either

In his month at the Muleshoe he had gained a very fair general idea of
the extent and resources of Burroback Valley but he had not made any
acquaintances and he did not know just where to go for his next job So
for want of something better he rode down to the little stream which he
now knew was called One Creek and prepared to spend the night there
In the morning he would make a fresh startand because of the streak of
stubbornness he had he meant to make it in Burroback Valley under the
very nose of the Muleshoe outfit



CHAPTER NINE LITTLE LOST

Little Lostsomehow the name appealed to Bud whose instinct for
harmony extended to words and phrases and for that matter to
everything in the world that was beautiful From the time when he first
heard Little Lost mentioned he had felt a vague regret that chance had
not led him there instead of to the Muleshoe Brands he had heard all
his life as the familiar colloquial names for ranch headquarters The
Muleshoe was merely a brand name Little Lost was something else
and because Buddy had been taught to wait and find out and to ask
questions only as a last resort Bud was still in ignorance of the
meaning of Little Lost He knew from careless remarks made in his
presence that the mail came to Little Lost and that there was some
sort of store where certain everyday necessities were kept for which
the storekeeper charged two prices But there was also a ranch for
he sometimes heard the boys mention the Little Lost cattle and speak of
some man as a rider for the Little Lost

So to Little Lost Bud rode blithely next morning riding Stopper and
leading Smoky Sunfish and the pack following as a matter of course
Again his trained instinct served him faithfully He had a very good
general idea of Burroback Valley he knew that the Muleshoe occupied a
fair part of the south side and guessed that he must ride north toward
the Gold Gap Mountains to find the place he wanted

The trail was easy his horses were as fat as was good for them In
two hours of riding at his usual trail pace he came upon another stream
which he knew must be Sunk Creek grown a little wider and deeper in its
journey down the valley He forded that with a great splashing climbed
the farther bank followed a stubby rocky bit of road that wound
through dense willow and cottonwood growth came out into a humpy meadow
full of ant hills gopher holes and soggy wet places where the water
grass grew crossed that and followed the road around a brushy ridge and
found himself squarely confronting Little Lost

There could be no mistake for Little Lost Post Office was unevenly
painted on the high crossbar of the gate that stood wide open and
permanently warped with long sagging There was a hitchrail outside the
gate and Bud took the hint and left his horses there From the wisps
of fresh hay strewn along the road Bud knew that haying had begun at
Little Lost There were at least four cabins and a somewhat pretentious
storyandahalf log house with vines reaching vainly to the high window
sills and coarse lace curtains One of these curtains moved slightly
and Buds sharp eyes detected the movement and knew that his arrival was
observed in spite of the emptiness of the yard

The beaten path led to a screen door which sagged with much slamming
leaving a wide space at the top through which flies passed in and out
quite comfortably Bud saw that also and his fingers itched to reset
that door just as he would have done for his mothersupposing his
mother would have tolerated the slamming which had brought the need Bud
lifted his gloved knuckles to knock saw that the room within was
grimy and bare and meant for public use very much like the office of a
country hotel with a counter and a set of pigeonholes at the farther
end He walked in

No one appeared and after ten minutes or so Bud guessed why and went
back to the door pushed it wide open and permitted it to fly shut with
a bang Whereupon a girl opened the door behind the counter and came in
glancing at Bud with frank curiosity

Bud took off his hat and clanked over to the counter and asked if there
was any mail for Bud BirnieRobert Wallace Birnie

The girl looked at him again and smiled and turned to shuffle a handful
of letters Bud employed the time in trying to guess just what she meant
by that smile

It was not really a smile he decided but the beginning of one And if
that were the beginning he would very much like to know what the whole
smile would mean The beginning hinted at things It was as if she
doubted the reality of the name he gave and meant to conceal her doubt
or had heard something amusing about him or wished to be friends with
him or was secretly timorous and trying to appear merely indifferent
Or perhaps

She replaced the letters and turned and rested her hands on the
counter She looked at him and again her lips turned at the corners in
that faint enigmatical beginning of a smile

There isnt a thing she said The mail comes this noon again Do you
want yours sent out to any of the outfits Or shall I just hold it

Just hold it when there is any At least until I see whether I land a
job here I wonder where I could find the boss Bud was glancing often
at her hands For a ranch girl her hands were soft and white but her
fingers were a bit too stubby and her nails were too round and flat

Uncle Dave will be home at noon Hes out in the meadow with the boys
You might sit down and wait

Bud looked at his watch Sitting down and waiting for four hours did not
appeal to him even supposing the girl would keep him company But he
lingered awhile leaning with his elbows on the counter near her and by
those obscure little conversational trails known to youth he progressed
considerably in his acquaintance with the girl and made her smile often
without once feeling quite certain that he knew what was in her mind

He discovered that her name was Honora Krause and that she was called
Honey for short Her father had been Dutch and her mother a Yankee
and she lived with her uncle Dave Truman who owned Little Lost ranch
and took care of the mail for him and attended to the storewhich
was nothing more than a supply depot kept for the accommodation of the
neighbors The store she said was in the next room

Bud asked her what Little Lost meant and she replied that she did not
know but that it might have something to do with Sunk Creek losing
itself in The Sinks There was a Little Lost river farther across the
mountains she said but it did not run through Little Lost ranch nor
come anywhere near it

After that she questioned him adroitly Perversely Bud declined to
become confidential and Honey Krause changed the subject abruptly

Theres going to be a dance here next Friday night Itll be a good
chance to get acquainted with everybodyif you go Therell be good
music I guess Uncle Dave wrote to Crater for the Saunders boys to come
down and play Do you know anybody in Crater

The question was innocent enough but perverseness still held Bud He
smiled and said he did not know anybody anywhere any more He said that
if Bobbie Burns had asked him Should auld acquaintance be forgot hed
have told him yes and hed have made it good and strong But he added
that he was just as willing to make new acquaintance and thought the
dance would be a good place to begin

Honey gave him a provocative glance from under her lashes and Bud
straightened and stepped back

You let folks stop here I take it Ive a pack outfit and a couple of
saddle horses with me Will it be all right to turn them in the corral
I hate to have them eat post hay all day Or I could perhaps go back to
the creek and camp

Oh just turn your horses in the corral and make yourself at home till
uncle comes she told him with that tantalizing halfsmile We keep
people herejust for accommodation There has to be some place in the
valley where folks can stop I cant promise that uncle will give you a
job but Theres going to be chicken and dumplings for dinner And the
mail will be in about noonyoull want to wait for that

She was standing just within the screen door frankly watching him as
he came past the house with the horses and she came out and halted him
when she spied the top of the pack

Youd better leave those things here she advised him eagerly Ill
put them in the sittingroom by the piano My goodness you must be a
whole orchestra If you can play maybe you and I can furnish the music
for the dance and save Uncle Dave hiring the Saunders boys Anyway we
can play together and have real good times

Bud had an odd feeling that Honey was talking one thing with her lips
and thinking an entirely different set of thoughts He eyed her covertly
while he untied the cases and he could have sworn that he saw her
signal someone behind the lace curtains of the nearest window He
glanced carelessly that way but the curtains were motionless Honey was
holding out her hands for the guitar and the mandolin when he turned so
Bud surrendered them and went on to the corrals

He did not return to the house An old man was pottering around a
machine shed that stood backed against a thick fringe of brush and when
Bud rode by he left his work and came after him taking short steps and
walking with his back bent stiffly forward and his hands swinging limply
at his sides

He had a long black beard streaked with gray and sharp blue eyes set
deep under tufted white eyebrows He seemed a friendly old man whose
interest in life remained keen as in his youth despite the feebleness
of his body He showed Bud where to turn the horses and went to work
on the pack rope his crooked old fingers moving with the sureness of
lifelong habit He was eager to know all the news that Bud could tell
him and when he discovered that Bud had just left the Muleshoe and
that he had been fired because of a fight with Dirk Tracy the old
fellow cackled gleefully

Well now I guess you just about had yore hands full young man he
commented shrewdly Dirk aint so easy to lick

Bud immediately wanted to know why it was taken for granted that he had
whipped Dirk and grandpa chortled again Now if you hadnt of licked
Dirk you wouldnt of got fired he retorted and proceeded to relate
a good deal of harmless gossip which seemed to bear out the statement
Dirk Tracy according to grandpa was the real boss of the Muleshoe and
Bart was merely a figurehead

All of this did not matter to Bud but grandpa was garrulous A good
deal of information Bud received while the two attended to the horses
and loitered at the corral gate

Grandpa admired Smoky and looked him over carefully with those
caressing smoothings of mane and forelock which betray the lover of good
horseflesh

I reckon hes purty fast he said peering shrewdly into Buds face
The boys has been talking about pulling off some horse races here next
Sundaywe got a good straight hardpacked creekbed up here a piece
that has been cleaned of rocks fer a mile track and theyre goin to
run a horse er two Most generally they do on Sunday if works slack
You might git in on it if youre around in these parts He pushed his
back straight with his palms turned his head sidewise and squinted at
Smoky through halfclosed lids while he fumbled for cigarette material

I dunno but what I might be willin to put up a few dollars on that
horse myself he observed if you say he kin run You wouldnt go an
lie to an old feller like me would yuh son

Bud offered him the cigarette he had just rolled No I wont lie to
you dad he grinned You know horses too well

Well but kin he run I want yore word on it

Wellyes hes always been able to turn a cow Bud admitted
cautiously

Ever run him fer money The old man began teetering from his toes to
his heels and to hitch his shoulders forward and back

Well no not for money Ive run him once or twice for fun just
trying to beat some of the boys to camp maybe

Sho Thats no way to do No way at all The old man spat angrily
into the dust of the corral Then he thought of something Did yuh BEAT
em he demanded sharply

Why sure I beat them Bud looked at him surprised seemed about to
say more and let the statement stand unqualified

Grandpa stared at him for a minute his blue eyes blinking with some
secret excitement Young feller he began abruptly lemme tell yuh
something Yuh never want to do a thing like that agin If you got a
horse that can outrun the other fellers horse figure to make him bring
yuh in somethingif it aint no moren a quarter Make him BRING yuh a
little something Thats the way to do with everything yuh turn a hand
to make it bring yuh in something It aint what goes out thatll do
yuh any goodits what comes in You mind that If you let a horse run
agin another fellers horse bet on him to come in aheadand then
he cried fiercely pounding one fist into the other palm by Christmas
make im come in ahead His voice cracked and went flat with emotion

He stopped suddenly and let his arms fall slack his shoulders sag
forward He waggled his head and muttered into his beard and glanced at
Bud with a crafty look

If Ida took that to mself I wouldnt be chorin around here now for
my own son he lamented Id of saved the quarters an Id of had a
few dollars now of my own Uh course he made haste to add I git holt
of a little now and agin Too old to ridetoo old to workjest manage
to pick up a dollar er two now and aginon a horse that kin run

He went over to Smoky again and ran his hand down over the leg muscles
to the hocks felt for imperfections and straightened painfully slapped
the horse approvingly between the forelegs and laid a hand on his
shoulder while he turned slowly to Bud

Young feller there aint a man on the place right now but you an
me What say you throw yore saddle on this horse and take im up to the
track Id like to see him run Seems to me hed ought to be a purty
good quarterhorse

Bud hesitated I wouldnt mind running him grandpa if I thought I
could make something on him Ive got my stake to make and I want to
make it before all my teeth fall out so I cant chew anything but the
cud of reflection on my lost opportunities If Smoky can run a few
dollars into my pocket Im with you

Grandpa teetered forward and put out his hand Shake on that boy he
cackled Pop Truman aint too old to have his little jokeand make it
bring him in something by Christmas You saddle up and well go try him
out on a quartermilemebby a half if he holds up good

He poked a cigarettestained forefinger against Buds chest and
whispered slyly My son Dave he s got a horse in the stable thats
been cleanin everything in the valley Ill slip him out and up the
creektrail to the track and you run that horse of yourn agin him Dave
he cant git a race outa nobody around here no more so he wont run
next Sunday Well jest see how yore horse runs alongside Boise I
kin tell purty well how you kin run agin the restPop he aint s
thickheaded they kin fool him much What say we try it

Bud stood back and looked him over You shook hands with me on it he
said gravely Where I came from that holds a man like taking oath on
a Bible in court Im a stranger here but Im going to expect the same
standard of honor grandpa You can back out now and Ill run Smoky
without any tryout and you can take your chance I couldnt expect you
to stand by a stranger against your own folks

Sho Shucks amighty Grandpa spat and wagged his head furiously My
own forksd beat me in a horse race if they could and I wouldnt hold
it agin em Runnin horses is like playin poker Every feller fer
himself an mercy toward none I knowed what it meant when I shook with
yuh young feller and I hold ye to it I hold ye to it You lay low if
I tell ye to lay low and well make us a few dollars mebby Cm on and
git that horse outa here bfore somebuddy comes Its mail day

He waved Bud toward his saddle and took himself off in a shuffling kind
of trot By the time Bud had saddled Smoky grandpa hailed him cautiously
from the brushfringe beyond the corral He motioned toward a small gate
and Bud led Smoky that way closing the gate after him

The old man was mounted on a cleanbuilt bay whose coat shone with
little glints of gold in the dark red With one sweeping look Bud
observed the points that told of speed and his eyes went inquiringly to
meet the sharp blue ones that sparkled under the tufted white eyebrows
of grandpa

Do you expect Smoky to show up the same day that horse arrives he
inquired mildly Pop youll have to prove to me that he wont run
Sunday

Pop snorted Seems to me like you do know a speedy horse when you see
one young feller Beats met you been overlookin what you got under
yore saddle right now Boise hes the best runnin horse in the
valleyand thats why he wont run next Sunday ner no other Sunday
till somebuddy brings in a strange horse to put agin him Dave he wont
crowd ye fur a race boy You kin refuse to run yore horse agin him
like the rest has done Ill jest lope along tday and see what yours
kin do

Well all right then Bud waited for the old man to ride ahead down
the obscure trail that wound through the brush for half a mile or so
before they emerged into the rough border of the creek bed Pop reined
in close and explained garrulously to Bud how this particular stream
disappeared into the ground two miles above Little Lost leaving the
wide level river bottom bone dry

Pop was cautious He rode up to a rise of ground and scanned the country
suspiciously before he led the way into the creek bed Even then he kept
close under the bank until they had passed two of the quartermile posts
that had been planted in the hard sand

Evidently he had been doing a good deal of thinking during the ride
certainly he had watched Smoky When he stopped under the bank opposite
the halfmile post he dismounted more spryly than one would have
expected His eyes were bright his voice sharp Pop was forgetting his
age

I guess Ill ride yore horse mself he announced and they exchanged
horses under the shelter of the bank You kin take an ride Boisean
I want you should beat me if you kin He looked at Bud appraisingly
Ill bet a dollar he cried suddenly that I kin outrun ye young
feller An you got the fastest horse in Burroback Valley and I dont
know what I got under me Im seventy years old come Septemberwhen Im
afoot Are ye afraid to bet

Im scared a dollars worth that Ill never see you again today unless
I ride back to find you Bud grinned

Any time you lose ole Pop Trumanshucks almighty Come on thenIll
show ye the way to the quarterpost

Im right with you Pop You say so and Im gone

They reined in with the shadow of the post falling square across the
necks of both horses Pop gathered up the reins set his feet in the
stirrups and shrilled Go gol darn ye

They went like two scared rabbits down the smooth yellow stretch of
packed sand Pops elbows stuck straight out he held the reins high
and leaned far over Smokys neck his eyes glaring Budoh never worry
about Bud In the years that lay between thirteen and twentyone Bud
had learned a good many things and one of them was how to get out of a
horse all the speed there was in him

They went past the quarterpost and a furlong beyond before either could
pull up Pop was pale and triumphant and breathing harder than his
mount

Here s your dollar Popand dont you talk in your sleep Bud
admonished smiling as he held out the dollar but with an anxious
tone in his voice If this is the best running horse youve got in the
valley I may get some action next Sunday

Pop dismounted took the dollar with a grin and mounted Boiseand that
in spite of the fact that Boise was keyed up and stepping around and
snorting for another race Bud watched Pop queerly remembering how
feeble had been the old man whom he had met at the corral

Say Pop you ought to race a little every day he bantered Youre
fifteen years younger than you were an hour ago

For answer Pop felt of his back and groaned Oh Ill pay fer it young
feller I dont look fer much peace with my back fer a week after this
But you kin make sure of one thing and that is I aint goin to talk
in my sleep none By Christmas Well make this horse of yours bring
us in something I guess you better turn yore horses all out in the
pasture Dave hell give yuh work all right Ill fix it with Dave
And you listen to Pop young feller Ill show ye a thing or two
about runnin horses Youn mell clean up a nice little bunch of
moneyHEHEbeat Boise in a quarter dash Tell that to Dave an he
wouldnt blieve ye

When Pop got off at the back of the stable he could scarcely move
he was so stiff But his mind was working well enough to see that Bud
rubbed the saddle print off Boise and turned his own horses loose in the
pasture before he let him go on to the house The last Bud heard from
Pop that forenoon was a senile chuckle and a cackling Outrun Boise
in a quarter dash Shucks amighty But I knew itI knew he had the
speedsho Ye cant fool ole Popshucks



CHAPTER TEN BUD MEETS THE WOMAN

A woman was stooping at the woodpile filling her arms with crooked
sticks of roughbarked sage From the color of her hair Bud knew that
she was not Honey and that she was therefore a stranger to him But he
swung off the path and went over to her as naturally as he would go to
pick up a baby that had fallen

Ill carry that in for you he said and put out his hand to help her
to her feet

Before he touched her she was on her feet and looking at him Bud could
not remember afterwards that she had done anything else he seemed to
have seen only her eyes and into them and beyond them to a soul that
somehow made his heart tremble

What she said what he answered was of no moment He could not have
told afterwards what it was He stooped and filled his arms with wood
and walked ahead of her up the pathway to the kitchen door and stopped
when she flitted past him to show him where the woodbox stood He was
conscious then of her slenderness and of the lightness of her steps
He dropped the wood into the box behind the stove on which kettles
were steaming There was the smell of chicken stewing and the odor of
freshbaked pies

She smiled up at him and offered him a crisp warn cookie with sugared
top and he saw her eyes again and felt the same tremor at his heart
He pulled himself together and smiled back at her thanked her and went
out stumbling a little on the doorstep the cookie untasted in his
fingers

He walked down to the corral and began fumbling at his pack his
thoughts hushed before the revelation that had come to him

Her handsher poor little red hands he said in a whisper as the
memory of them came suddenly But it was her eyes that he was seeing
with his mind her eyes and what lay deep within They troubled him
shook him made him want to use his manstrength against something that
was hurting her He did not know what it could be he did not know that
there was anythingbut oddly the memory of his mothers white face back
in the long ago and of her tone when she said Oh God please came
back and fitted themselves to the look in this womans eyes

Bud sat down on his canvaswrapped bed and lifted his hat to rumple his
hair and then smooth it again as was his habit when worried He looked
at the cookie and because he was hungry he ate it with a foolish
feeling that he was being sentimental as the very devil thinking how
her hands had touched it He rolled and smoked a cigarette afterwards
and wondered who she was and whether she was married and what her first
name was

A quiet smoke will bring a fellow to his senses sometimes when
nothing else will and Bud managed by smoking two cigarettes in rapid
succession to restore himself to some degree of sanity

Funny how she made me think of mother back when I was a kid coming up
from Texas he mused Motherd like her It was the first time he had
ever thought just that about a girl Shes no relation to Honey he
added Id bet a horse on that He recalled how white and soft were
Honeys hands and he swore a little Wouldnt hurt her to get out
there in the kitchen and help with the cooking he criticised Then
suddenly he laughed Shucks amighty as Pop says with those two girls
on the ranch Ill gamble Dave Truman has a full crew of men that are
plumb willing to work for their board

The stage came and Bud turned to it relievedly After that here came
Dave Truman on a deepcheated roan Bud knew him by his resemblance to
the old man who came shuffling bentbacked from the machineshed as
Dave passed

Pop beckoned and Dave reined his horse that way and stopped at the shed
door The two talked for a minute and Dave rode on passing Bud with a
curt nod Pop came over to where Bud stood leaning against the corral

How are you feeling dad Bud grinned absently

Purty stiff an sore boymy rheumatics is bad today Pop winked
solemnly I spoke to Dave about you wantin a job and I guess likely
Davell put you on Theys plenty to dohayin comin on and all that
He lowered his voice mysteriously though there was no man save Bud
within a hundred feet of him Dont ye go n talk horsesnot yet
Dont let on like yore interested much Ill tell yuh when to take em
up

The men came riding in from the hayfield some in wagons two astride
harnessed workhorses and one longlegged fellow in chaps on a mower
driving a sweaty team that still had life enough to jump sidewise when
they spied Buds pack by the corral The stage driver sauntered up and
spoke to the men Bud went over and began to help unhitch the team from
the mower and the driver eyed him sharply while he grinned his greeting
across the backs of the horses

Pop says youre looking for work Dave Truman observed coming up
Well if you aint scared of it Ill stake yuh to a hayfork after
dinner Where yuh from

Just right now Im from the Muleshoe Bud Birnies my name I was
telling dad why I quit

Tell me Dave directed briefly Pop aint as reliable as he used to
be Hed never get it out straight

I quit said Bud by special request He pulled off his gloves
carefully and held up his puffed knuckles I got that on Dirk Tracy

The driver of the mower shot a quick meaning glance at Dave and
laughed shortly Dave grinned a little but he did not ask what had been
the trouble as Bud had half expected him to do Apparently Dave felt
that he had received all the information he needed for his next remark
had to do with the heat The day was a weather breeder he declared
and he was glad to have another man to put at the hauling

An iron triangle beside the kitchen door clamored then and Bud looking
quickly saw the slim little woman with the big troubled eyes striking
the iron bar vigorously Dave glanced at his watch and led the way to
the house the hay crew hurrying after him

Fourteen men sat down to a long table with a great shuffling of feet and
scraping of benches and immediately began a voracious attack upon the
heaped platters of chicken and dumplings and the bowls of vegetables
Bud found a place at the end where he could look into the kitchen
and his eyes went that way as often as they dared following the swift
motions of the little woman who poured coffee and filled empty dishes
and said never a word to anyone

He was on the point of believing her a daughter of the house when a
squarejawed man of thirty or thereabout who sat at Buds right hand
called her to him as he might have called his dog by snapping his
fingers

She came and stood beside Bud while the man spoke to her in an arrogant
undertone

Marian I told yuh I wanted tea for dinner after this Dyou bring me
coffee on purpose just to be onery I thought I told yuh to straighten
up and quit that sulkin I aint going to have folks think

Oh be quiet Shame on you before everyone she whispered fiercely
while she lifted the cup and saucer

Bud went hot all over He did not look up when she returned presently
with a cup of tea but he felt her presence poignantly as he had never
before sensed the presence of a woman When he was able to swallow his
wrath and meet calmly the glances of these strangers he turned his head
casually and looked the man over

Her husband he guessed the fellow to be No other relationship could
account for that tone of proprietorship and there was no physical
resemblance between the two A mean devil Bud called him mentally
with a narrow forehead eyes set too far apart and the mouth of a brute
Someone spoke to the man calling him Lew and he answered with rough
good humor repeating a stale witticism and laughing at it just as
though he had not heard others say it a hundred times

Bud looked at him again and hated him but he did not glance again at
the little woman named Marian for his own peace of mind he did not
dare He thought that he knew now what it was he had seen in the depth
of her eyes but there seemed to be nothing that he could do to help

That evening after supper Honey Krause called to him when he was
starting down to the bunkhouse with the other men What she said
was that she still had his guitar and mandolin and that they needed
exercise What she looked was the challenge of a born coquette In the
kitchen dishes were rattling but after they were washed there would be
a little leisure perhaps for the kitchen drudge Buds impulse to make
his sore hands an excuse for refusing evaporated It might not be wise
to place himself deliberately in the way of getting a hurtbut youth
never did stop to consult a sage before following the lure of a womans
eyes

He called back to Honey that those instruments ought to have been put in
the hayfield where there was more exercise than the men could use You
boys ought to come and see me safe through with it he added to the
loitering group around him Im afraid of women

They laughed and two or three went with him Lew went on to the corral
and presently appeared on horseback riding up to the kitchen and
leaving his horse standing at the corner while he went inside and talked
to the woman he had called Marian

Bud was carrying his guitar outside where it was cooler when he heard
the fellows arrogant voice The dishes ceased rattling for a
minute and there was a sharp exclamation stifled but unmistakable
Involuntarily Bud made a movement in that direction when Honeys voice
stopped him with a subdued laugh

Thats only Lew and Mary Ann she explained carelessly They have a
spat every time they come within gunshot of each other

The lean fellow who had driven the mower and whose name was Jerry
Myers edged carelessly close to Bud and gave him a nudge with his
elbow and a glance from under his eyebrows by way of emphasis He
turned his head slightly saw that Honey had gone into the house and
muttered just above a whisper Dont see or hear anything Its all the
help you can give her And for Lords sake dont let on to Honey like
yougive a cuss whether it rains or not so long s it dont pour too
hard the night of the dance

Bud looked up at the darkening sky speculatively and tried not to hear
the voices in the kitchen one of which was brutally harsh while the
other told of hate and fear suppressed under gentle forbearance The
harsh voice was almost continuous the other infrequent reluctant to
speak at all Bud wanted to go in and smash his guitar over the fellows
head but Jerrys warning held him There were other ways however to
help if he must not drive off the tormentor then he would call him
away He ignored his bruised knuckles and plucked the guitar strings as
if he held a grudge against them and then began to sing the first song
that came into his mindone that started in a rollicky fashion

Men came straggling up from the bunkhouse before he had finished the
first chorus and squatted on their heels to listen their cigarettes
glowing like red fingertips in the dusk But the voice in the kitchen
talked on Bud tried anotherone of those oldtime favorites a
laughing coon song though he felt little enough in the mood for it
In the middle of the first laugh he heard the kitchen door slam and
Lews footsteps coming around the corner He listened until the song
was done then mounted and rode away Buds laugh following him
triumphantlythough Lew could not have guessed its meaning

Bud sang for two hours expectantly but Marian did not appear and Bud
went off to the bunkhouse feeling that his attempt to hearten her had
been a failure Of Honey he did not think at all except to wonder if
the two women were related in any way and to feel that if they were
Marian was to be pitied At that point Jerry overtook him and asked for
a match which gave him an excuse to hold Bud behind the others

Honey like to have caught me tonight Jerry observed guardedly
I had to think quick Ill tell you the lay of the land Bud seeing
youre a stranger here Marians man Lew hes a damned bully and
somebody is going to draw a fine bead on him some day when he aint
looking But he stands in so the less yuh take notice the better
Marian shes a fine little woman that minds her own business but shes
getting a cold deck slipped into the game right along Honeys jealous
of her and afraid somebodyll give her a pleasant look Lews jealous
and he watches her like a cat watches a mouse its caught and wants to
play with Between the two of em Marian has a real nice time of it Im
wising you up so you wont hand her any more misery by trying to take
her part Us boys have learned to keep our mouths shut

Glad you told me Bud muttered Otherwise

Exactly Jerry agreed understandingly Otherwise any of us would

He stopped and then spoke in a different tone If Lew stays off the
ranch long enough maybe youll get to hear her sing Wowee but that
lady has sure got the meadowlarks whipped But look out for Honey
oldtimer

Bud laughed unmirthfully Looks to me as if you arent crazy over
Honey he ventured What has she done to you

Her Jerry inspected his cigarette listened to the whisper of
prudence in his ear and turned away Forget it I never said a word
He swept the whole subject from him with a comprehensive gesture and
snorted Im gettin as bad as Pop he grinned But lemme tell yuh
something Honey Krause runs more n the postoffice



CHAPTER ELEVEN GUILE AGAINST THE WILY

Bud liked to have his life run along accustomed lines with a more or
less perfect balance of work and play friendships and enmities He
had grown up with the belief that any mystery is merely a synonym for
menace He had learned to be wary of known enemies such as Indians
and outlaws and to trust implicitly his friends To feel now without
apparent cause that his friends might be enemies in disguise was a new
experience that harried him

He had come to Little Lost on Tuesday straight from the Muleshoe
where his presence was no longer desired for some reason not yet
satisfactorily explained to him You know what happened on Tuesday That
night the land crouched under a terrific electric storm with crackling
swords of white death dazzling from inky black clouds and earsplitting
thunder close on the heels of it Bud had known such storms all his
life yet on this night he was uneasy vaguely disturbed He caught
himself wondering if Lew Morriss wife was frightened and the
realization that he was worrying about her fear worried him more than
ever and held him awake long after the fury of the storm had passed

Next day when he came in at noon there was Hen from the Muleshoe
waiting for dinner before he rode back with the mail Hens jaw dropped
when he saw Bud riding on a Little Lost haywagon and his eyes bulged
with what Bud believed was consternation All through the meal Bud had
caught Hen eyeing him miserably and looking stealthily from him to the
others No one paid any attention and for that Bud was rather thankful
he did not want the Little Lost fellows to think that perhaps he had
done something which he knew would hang him if it were discovered
which he decided was the mildest interpretation a keen observer would
be apt to make of Hens behavior

When he went out Hen was at his heels trying to say something in his
futile tonguetied gobble Bud stopped and looked at him tolerantly
Hen Its no useyou might as well be talking Chinese for all I
know If its important write it down or Ill never know whats on your
mind

He pulled a notebook and a pencil from his vestpocket and gave them
to Hen who looked at him dumbly worked his Adams apple violently and
retreated to his horse fumbled the mail which was tied in the bottom of
a flour sack for safe keeping sought a sheltered place where he could
sit down remained there a few minutes and then returned to his horse
He beckoned to Bud who was watching him curiously and when Bud went
over to him said something unintelligible and handed back the notebook
motioning for caution when Bud would have opened the book at once

So Bud thanked him gravely but with a twinkle in his eyes and waited
until Hen had gone and he was alone before he read the message It was
mysterious enough certainly Hen had written in a fine cramped uneven
hand

You bee carful bern this up and dent let on like you no anything but
i warn you be shure bern this up

Bud tore out the page and burned it as requested and since he was not
enlightened by the warning he obeyed Hens instructions and did not let
on But he could not help wondering and was unconsciously prepared to
observe little things which ordinarily would have passed unnoticed

At the dance on Friday night for instance there was a good deal of
drinking and mighty little hilarity Bud had been accustomed to loud
talk and much horseplay outside among the men on such occasions and
even a fight or two would be accepted as a matter of course But though
several quart bottles were passed around during the night and thrown
away empty into the bushes the men went in and danced and came out
again immediately to converse confidentially in small groups or to
smoke without much speech The men of Burroback Valley were not running
true to form

The women were much like all the women of cowcountry mothers with
small children who early became cross and sleepy and were hushed under
shawls on the most convenient bed a piece of cake in their hands
mothers whose faces were lined too soon with work and illhealth and
with untidy hair that became untidier as the dance progressed There
were daughtersshy and giggling to hide their shynessBud knew their
type very well and made friends with them easily and immediately became
the centre of a clamoring audience after he had sung a song or two

There was Honey with her inscrutable half smile and her veiled eyes
condescending to graciousness and quite plainly assuming a proprietary
air toward Bud whom she put through whatever musical paces pleased her
fancy Bud I may say was extremely tractable When Honey said sing
Bud sang when she said play Bud sat down to the piano and played
until she asked him to do something else It was all very pleasant for
Honeyand Bud ultimately won his pointHoney decided to extend her
graciousness a little

Why hadnt Bud danced with Marian He must go right away and ask her
to dance Just because Lew was gone Marian need not be slightedand
besides there were other fellows who might want a little of Honeys
time

So Bud went away and found Marian in the pantry cutting cakes while the
coffee boiled and asked her to dance Marian was too tired and she
had not the time to spare wherefore Bud helped himself to a knife
and proceeded to cut cakes with geometrical precision and ate all
the crumbs With his hands busy he found the courage to talk to her a
little He made Marian laugh out loud and it was the first time he had
ever heard her do that

Marian disclosed a sense of humor and even teased Bud a little about
Honey But her teasing lacked that edge of bitterness which Bud had half
expected in retaliation for Honeys little air of superiority

Your precision in cutting cakes is very much like your accurate
fingering of the piano she observed irrelevantly surveying his
work with her lips pursed A pair of calipers would prove every piece
exactly the same width and even when you play a Meditation Im
sure the metronome would waggle in perfect unison with your tempo I
wonder She glanced up at him speculatively I wonder if you think
with such mathematical precision Do you always find that two and two
make four

You mean have I any imagination whatever Bud looked away from her
eyestoward the uncurtained high little window A face appeared there
as if a tall man had glanced in as he was passing by and halted for a
second to look Buds eyes met full the eyes of the man outside who
tilted his head backward in a significant movement and passed on Marian
turned her head and caught the signal looked at Bud quickly a little
flush creeping into her cheeks

I hope you have a little imagination she said lowering her voice
instinctively It doesnt require much to see that Jerry is right The
conventions are strictly observed at Little Lostin the kitchen at
least she added under her breath with a flash of resentment Run
alongand the next time Honey asks you to play the piano will you
please play Lotusblume And when you have thrown open the prison windows
with that will you play Schuberts Ave Mariathe way you play itto
send a breath of cool night air in

She put out the tips of her fingers and pressed them lightly against
Buds shoulder turning toward the door Bud started stepped into the
kitchen wheeled about and stood regarding her with a stubborn look in
his eyes

I might kick the door down too he said I dont like prisons
nohow

Nojust a window thank you she laughed

Bud thought the laugh did not go very deep Jerry wants to talk to
you Hes the whitest of the lot if you can call that she stopped
abruptly put out a hand to the door gave him a moment to look into her
deep troubled eyes and closed the door gently but inexorably in his
face

Jerry was standing at the corner of the house smoking negligently He
waited until Bud had come close alongside him then led the way slowly
down the path to the corrals

I thought I heard the horses fighting he remarked There was a noise
down this way

Is that why you called me outside asked Bud who scorned subterfuge

Yeah I saw you wasnt dancing or singing or playing the pianoand
I knew Honeyd likely be looking you up to do one or the other in a
minute She sure likes you Bud She dont everybody that comes along

Bud did not want to discuss Honey wherefore he made no reply and they
walked along in silence the cool heavy darkness grateful after the oil
lamps and the heat of crowded rooms As they neared the corrals a stable
door creaked open and shut yet there was no wind Jerry halted one
hand going to Buds arm They stood for a minute and heard the swish of
the bushes behind the corral as if a horse were passing through Jerry
turned back leading Bud by the arm They were fifty feet away and the
bushes were still again before Jerry spoke guardedly

I guess I made a mistake There wasnt nothing he said and dropped
Buds arm

Bud stopped There was a man riding off in the brush he said bluntly
and all the folks that came to the dance rode in through the front
gate I reckon Ill just take a look where I left my saddle anyway

That might have been some loose stock Jerry argued but Bud went
back wondering a little at Jerrys manner

The saddle was all right and so was everything else so far as Bud
could determine in the dark but he was not satisfied He thought he
understood Jerrys reason for bringing him down to the corrals but he
could not understand Jerrys attitude toward an incident which any man
would have called suspicious

Bud quietly counted noses when he returned to the house and found that
supper was being served but he could not recall any man who was missing
now Every guest and every man on the ranch was present except old Pop
who had a little shack to himself and went to bed at dark every night

Bud was mystified and he hated mysteries Moreover he was working for
Dave Truman and whatever might concern Little Lost concerned him also
But the men had begun to talk openly of their various running horses
and to exchange jibes and boasts and to bet a little on Sundays races
Bud wanted to miss nothing of that and Jerrys indifference to the
incident at the stable served to reassure him for the time being He
edged close to the group where the talk was loudest and listened

A man they called Jeff was trying to jeer his neighbors into betting
against a horse called Skeeter and was finding them too cautious for
his liking He laughed and happening to catch Buds eyes upon him
strode forward with an empty tin cup in his hand and slapped Bud
friendliwise on the shoulder

Why I bet this singin kid that dont know wha I got ner what you
fellers has got aint scared to take a chance Are yuh kid What d
yuh think of this pikin bunch here that has seen Skeeter come in second
and third more times n what he beat and yet is afraid to take a chance
on rosin two bits Whatd yuh think of em Aint they an onery bunch

I suppose they hate to lose Bud grinned

Thats itmoney s more to em than the sport of kings which is
runnin horses This bunch kid bellyached till Dave took his horse
Boise outa the game and now by gosh theyre backin up from my
Skeeter that has been beat more times than he won

When you pulled him Jeff a mocking voice drawled And that was when
you wasnt bettin yourself

Jeff turned injuredly to Bud Now dont that sound like a piker he
complained It aint reason to claim Id pull my own horse Aint that
the out doinest way to come back at a man that likes a good race

Bud swelled his chest and laid his hand on Jeffs shoulder Just
to show you Im not a piker he cried recklessly Ill bet you
twentyfive dollars I can beat your Skeeter with my Smoky horse that I
rode in here Is it a go

Jeffs jaw dropped a little with surprise What fer horse is this here
Smoky horse of yourn he wanted to know

Bud winked at the group which cackled gleeful I love the sport of
kings he said I love it so well I dont have to see your Skeeter
horse till Sunday From the way these boys sidestep him I guess hes a
sureenough running horse My Smokys a good little horse too but he
never scared a bunch till they had cramps in the pockets Still
he added with a grin Ill try anything once I bet you twentyfive
dollars my Smoky can beat your Skeeter

Say kid honest I hate to take it away from yuh Honest I do The way
you can knock the livin tar outa that pyanny is a caution to cats I
cd listen all night But when it comes to runnin horses

Are you afraid of your money Bud asked him arrogantly You called
this a bunch of pikers

Well by golly itll be your own fault kid If I take your money away
from yuh dont go and blame it onto me Mebbe these fellers has got
some cause to sidestep

All right the bets on And I wont blame you if I lose Smokys
a good little horse Dont think for a minute Im giving you my hard
earned coin Youll have to throw up some dust to get it oldtimer I
forgot to say Id like to make it a quarter dash

A quarter dash it is Jeff agreed derisively as Bud turned to answer
the summons of the music which was beginning again

The racing enthusiasts lingered outside and Bud smiled to himself while
he whirled Honey twice around in an oldfashioned waltz He had them
talking about him and wondering about his horse When they saw Smoky
they would perhaps call him a chancey kid He meant to ask Pop about
Skeeter though Pop seemed confident that Smoky would win against
anything in the valley

But on the other hand he had seen in his short acquaintance with Little
Lost that Pop was considered childishthat comprehensive accusation
which belittles the wisdom of age The boys made it a point to humor him
without taking him seriously Honey pampered him and called him Poppy
while in Marians chill courtesy in her averted glances Bud had read
her dislike of Pop He had seen her hand shrink away from contact with
his hand when she set his coffee beside his plate

But Bud had heard others speak respectfully of Boise and regret that
he was too fast to run Pop might be childish on some subjects but
Bud rather banked on his judgment of horsesand Pop was penurious and
anxious to win money

What are you thinking about Honey demanded when the music stopped
Something awful important I guess to make you want to keep right on
dancing

I was thinking of horseracing Bud confessed glad that he could tell
her the truth

Ah you Dont let them make a fool of you Some of the fellows would
bet the shirt off their backs on a horserace You look out for them
Bud

They wouldnt bet any more than I would Bud boldly declared Ive
bet already against a horse Ive never seen How s that

Thats crazy Youll lose and serve you right She went off to dance
with someone else and Bud turned smiling to find a passable partner
amongst the older womenfor he was inclined to caution where strange
girls were concerned Much trouble could come to a stranger who danced
with a girl who happened to have a jealous sweetheart and Bud did
not court trouble of that kind He much preferred to fight over other
things Besides he had no wish to antagonize Honey

But his dance with some faded heavyfooted woman was not to be Jerry
once more signalled him and drew him outside for a little private
conference Jerry was ill at ease and inclined to be reproachful and
even condemnatory

He wanted first to know why Bud had been such a many kinds of a fool as
to make that bet with Jeff Hall All the fellows were talking about it
They was asking me what kind of a horse youve gotand I wouldnt put
it past Jeff and his bunch to pull some kind of a dirty trick on you
he complained Bud on the square I like you a whole lot You seem
kinda innocent in some ways and in other ways you dont I wish youd
tell me just one thing so I can sleep comfortable Have you got some
scheme of your own Or what the devil ails you

Well Ive just got a notion Bud admitted Im going to have some
fun watching those fellows perform whether I win or lose Ive spent as
much as twentyfive dollars on a circus before now and felt that I got
the worth of my money too Im going to enjoy myself real well next
Sunday

Jerry glanced behind him and lowered his voice speaking close to Buds
ear Well theres something Id like to say that it aint safe to say
Bud Id hate like hell to see you get in trouble Go as far as you like
having funbutoh hell Whats the use He turned abruptly and went
inside leaving Bud staring after him rather blankly

Jerry did not strike Bud as being the kind of a man who goes
around interfering with every other mans business He was a quiet
goodnatured young fellow with quizzical eyes of that mixed color which
we call hazel simply because there is more brown than gray or green He
did not talk much but he observed much Bud was strongly inclined
to heed Jerrys warning but it was too vague to have any practical
valueabout like Hens note Bud concluded Wellmeaning but hazy
Like a red danger flag on a railroad crossing where the track is torn
up and moved I saw one once and my horse threw a fit at it and almost
piled me I figured that the red flag created the danger where I was
concerned Still Id like to oblige Jerry and sidestep something or
other but

His thoughts grew less distinct merged into wordless rememberings and
conjectures clarified again into terse sentences which never reached
the medium of speech

Well Ill just make sure they dont try out Smoke when Im not
looking he decided and slipped away in the dark

By a roundabout way which avoided the trail he managed to reach the
pasture fence without being seen No horses grazed in sight and he
climbed through and went picking his way across the lumpy meadow in the
starlight At the farther side he found the horses standing out on a
sandy ridge where the mosquitoes were not quite so pestiferous The
Little Lost horses snorted and took to their heels his three following
for a short distance

Bud stopped and whistled a peculiar call invented long ago when he was
just Buddy and watched over the Tomahawk REMUDA Every horse with the
Tomahawk brand knew that summonsthough not every horse would obey
it But these three had come when they were sucking colts if Buddy
whistled and in their breaking and training in the long trip north
they had not questioned its authority They turned and trotted back to
him now and nosed Buds hands which he held out to them

He petted them all and talked to them in an affectionate murmur which
they answered by sundry lipnibbles and subdued snorts Smoky he singled
out finally rubbing his back and sides with the flat of his hand from
shoulder to flank and so to the rump and down the thigh to the hock
to the scanty fetlock which told to those who knew that here was an
aristocrat among horses

Smoky stood quiet and Buds hand lingered there smoothing the slender
ankle Buds fingers felt the finehaired tail then gave a little
twitch He was busy for a minute kneeling in the sand with one knee
his head bent Then he stood up went forward to Smokys head and stood
rubbing the horses nose thoughtfully

I hate to do it old boybut Im working to makes a homeweve got
to work together And Im not asking any more of you than Id be willing
to do myself if I were a horse and you were a man

He gave the three horses a hasty pat apiece and started back across
the meadow to the fence They followed him like pet dogsand when Bud
glanced back over his shoulder he saw in the dim light that Smoky walked
with a slight limp



CHAPTER TWELVE SPORT O KINGS

Sunday happened to be fair with not too strong a wind blowing Before
noon Little Lost ranch was a busy place and just before dinner it
became busier Horseracing seemed to be as popular a sport in the
valley as dancing Indeed men came riding in who had not come to the
dance The dry creekbed where the horses would run had no road leading
to it so that all vehicles came to Little Lost and remained there while
the passengers continued on foot to the races

At the corral fresh shaven men in clean shirts to distinguish this as a
dressup occasion foregathered looking over the horses and making bets
and arguing Pop shambled here and there smoking cigarettes furiously
and keeping a keen ear toward the loudest betting He came sidling up to
Bud who was leading Smoky out of the stable and his sharp eyes took in
every inch of the horse and went inquiringly to Buds face

Goin to run him young fellerlame as what he is he demanded
sharply

Going to try anyway said Bud Ive got a bet up on him dad

Sho Fixin to lose air ye You kin call it off like as not Jeff
aint so onreasonble t hed make yuh run a lame horse Air yuh Jeff

Jeff strolled up and looked Smoky over with critical eyes Whats the
matter Aint the kid game to run him Looks to me like a good little
goer

Hes got a limpbut Ill run him anyway Bud glanced up Maybe when
hes warmed up hell forget about it

Seen my Skeeter

Good horse I should judge Bud observed indifferently But I aint
worrying any

Well neither am I Jeff grinned

Pop stood teetering back and forth plainly uneasy Id rub him right
good with liniment he advised Bud Ill git somet I know ought t
help

Whats the matter Pop You got money up on that cayuse Jeff laughed

Pop whirled on him I aint got money up on him no But if he wasnt
lame Id have some Id show ye t I admire gameness in a kid I would
so

Jeff nudged his neighbor into laughter There aint a gamer old bird
in the valley than Pop Jeff cried Cm awn Pop Ill bet yuh ten
dollars the kid beats me

Pop was shuffling hurriedly out of the corral after the liniment To
Jeffs challenge he made no reply whatever The group around Jeff shooed
Smoky gently toward the other side of the corral thereby convincing
themselves of the limp in his right hind foot While not so pronounced
as to be crippling it certainly was no asset to a running horse and
the wise ones conferred together in undertones

That there kids a born fool Dave Truman stated positively The
horse cant run Hes got the look of a speedy little animalbut
shucks The kid dont know anything about running horses Ive been
talking to him and I know Jeff youre taking the money away from him
if you run that race

Well Im giving the kid a chance to back out Jeff hastened to
declare He can put it off till his horse gits well if he wants to I
aint going to hold him to it I never said I was

Thats mighty kind of you Bud said coming up from behind with a
bottle of liniment and with Pop at his heels But Ill run him just
the same Smoky has favored this foot before and it never seemed to
hurt him any You neednt think Im going to crawfish You must think
Im a whining cusssay Ill bet another ten dollars that I dont come
in more than a neck behind lame horse or not

Now kid dont git chancey Pop admonished uneasily Twentyfive is
enough money to donate to Jeff

Thats right kid I like your nerve Jeff cut in emphasizing his
approval with a slap on Buds shoulder as he bent to lift Smokys leg
Ive saw worse horses than this one come in aheadit wouldnt be no
sport o kings if nobody took a chance

Im taking chance enough Bud retorted without looking up If I dont
win this time I will the next maybe

Thats right Jeff agreed heartily winking broadly at the others
behind Buds back

Bud rubbed Smokys ankle with liniment listened to various and sundry
selfappointed advisers and without seeming to think how the sums would
total took several other small bets on the race They were smallPop
began to teeter back and forth and lift his shoulders and pull his
beardsure signs of perturbation

By Christmas Ill just put up ten dollars on the kid Pop finally
cackled I aint got much to losebut Ill show yuh old Pop aint
going to see the young feller stand alone He tried to catch Buds eye
but that young man was busy saddling Smoky and returning jibe for jibe
with the men around him and did not glance toward Pop at all

Ill take this bottle in my pocket Pop he said with his back toward
the old man and mounted carelessly Ill ride him around a little and
give him another good rubbing before we run Im betting he added to
the others frankly on the chance that exercise and the liniment will
take the soreness out of that ankle I dont believe it amounts to
anything at all So if any of you fellows want to bet

Shucks Dont go n Pop began and bit the sentence in two dropping
immediately into a deep study The kid was getting beyond Pops
understanding

A crowd of perhaps a hundred men and womenwith a generous sprinkling
of unruly juvenileslined the sheer bank of the creekbed and watched
the horses run and screamed their cheap witticisms at the losers and
their approval of those who won The youngster with the mysterious past
and the foolhardiness to bet on a lame horse they watched and discussed
the women plainly wishing he would winbecause he was handsome and
young and such a wonderful musician The men were more coldblooded
They could not see that Buds good looks or the haunting melody of his
voice had any bearing whatever upon his winning a race They called him
a fool and either refused to bet at all on such a freak proposition as
a lame horse running against Skeeter or bet against him A few of the
wise ones wondered if Jeff and his bunch were merely stringing the kid
along  if they might not let him win a little just to make him more
chancey But they did not think it wise to bet on that probability

While three races were being run Bud rode with the Little Lost men and
Smoky still limped a little Jerry Myers still selfappointed guardian
of Bud herded him apart and called him a fool and implored him to call
the race off and keep his money in his own pocket

Bud was thinking just then about a certain little woman who sat on the
creek bank with a widebrimmed straw hat shading her wonderful eyes and
a pair of little higharched feet tapping heels absently against the
bank wall Honey sat beside her and a couple of the valley women whom
Bud had met at the dance He had ridden close and paused for a few
friendly sentences with the quartette careful to give Honey the
attention she plainly expected But it was not Honey who wore the wide
hat and owned the pretty little feet Bud pulled his thoughts back from
a fruitless wish that he might in some way help that little woman whose
trouble looked from her eyes and whose lips smiled so bravely He did
not think of possession when he thought of her it was the look in her
eyes and the slighting tones in which Honey spoke of her

Say come alive What yuh going off in a trance for when Im talking
to yuh for your own good Jerry smiled whimsically but his eyes were
worried

Bud pulled himself together and reined closer

Dont bet anything on this race Jerry he advised Or if you do
dont bet on Skeeter Butwell Ill just trade you a little advice for
all youve given me Dont bet

What the hell surprise jolted out of Jerry

Its my funeral Bud laughed Im a chancey kid you seebut Id
hate to see you bet on me He pulled up to watch the next racefour
nervy little cowhorses of true range breeding going down to the
quarter post

They re going to make false starts aplenty Bud remarked after the
first fluke Jeff and I have it out next Ill just give Smoke another
treatment He dismounted looked at Jerry undecidedly and slapped him
on the knee Im glad to have a friend like you he said impulsively
Theres a lot of twofaced sinners around here that would steal a man
blind Dont think Im altogether a fool

Jerry looked at him queerly opened his mouth and shut it again so
tightly that his jawbones stood out a little He watched Bud bathing
Smokys ankle When Bud was through and handed Jerry the bottle to keep
for him Jerry held him for an instant by the hand

Say for Gawdsake dont talk like that promiscuous Bud he begged
You might hit too close

Ay Jerry Ever hear that old Armenian proverb He who tells the truth
should have one foot in the stirrup I learned that in school

Jerry let go Buds hand and took the bottle Buds watch that had his
mothers picture pasted in the back and his vest a pocket of which
contained a memorandum of his wagers Bud was stepping out of his chaps
and he looked up and grinned Cheer up Jerry Youre going to laugh in
a minute When Jerry still remained thoughtful Bud added soberly I
appreciate you and old Pop standing by me I dont know just what youve
got on your mind but the fact that theres something is hint enough for
me Whereupon Jerrys eyes lightened a little

The four horses came thundering down the track throwing tiny pebbles
high into the air as they passed A trim little sorrel won and there
was the usual confusion of voices upraised in an effort to be heard
When that had subsided interest once more centered on Skeeter and
Smoky who seemed to have recovered somewhat from his lameness

Not a man save Pop and Bud had placed a bet on Smoky yet every man
there seemed keenly interested in the race They joshed Bud who grinned
and took it goodnaturedly and found another five dollars inhis
pocket to betthis time with Pop who kept eyeing him sharplyand it
seemed to Bud warningly But Bud wanted to play his own game this time
and he avoided Pops eyes

The two men rode down the hoofscored sand to the quarter post
Skeeter dancing sidewise at the prospect of a race Smoky now and then
tentatively against Buds steady pressure of the bit

Hes not limping now Bud gloated as they rode But Jeff only laughed
tolerantly and made no reply

Dave Truman started them with a pistol shot and the two horses darted
away Smoky half a jump in the lead His limp was forgotten and for
half the distance he ran neck and neck with Skeeter Then he dropped to
Skeeters middle to his flankthen ran with his black nose even
with Skeeters rump Even so it was a closer race than the crowd had
expected and all the cowboys began to yell themselves purple

But when they were yet a few leaps from the wire clothesline stretched
high from post to post Bud leaned forward until he lay flat alongside
Smokys neck and gave a real Indian warwhoop Smoky lifted and
lengthened his stride came up again to Skeeters middle to his
shoulder to his earsand with the next leap thrust his nose past
Skeeters as they finished

Well then there was the usual noise everyone trying to shout louder
than his fellows Bud rode to where Pop was sitting apart on a pacing
gray horse that he always rode and paused to say guardedly

I pulled him Pop But at that I won so if I can pry another race
out of this bunch today you can bet all you like And you owe me five
dollars he added thriftily

Sho Shucks almighty spluttered Pop reaching reluctantly into his
pocket for the money Jeff he done some pullin himselfI wish I
knowed he added pettishly just how big a fool you air

Hey come over here shouted Jeff What yuh nagging ole Pop about

Pop lost five dollars on that race Bud called back and loped over
to the crowd But he isnt the only one Seems to me Ive got quite a
bunch of money coming to me from this crowd

Jeff hed a beat him a mile if his bridle rein had busted an
arrogant voice shouted recklessly Jeff you old fox you know damn
well you pulled Skeeter You must love to lose doggone yuh

If you think I didnt run right Jeff retorted as if a little
nettled someone else can ride the horse That is if the kid here
aint scared off with your talk How about it Bud Think you won fair

Bud was collecting his money and he did not immediately answer the
challenge When he did it was to offer them another race He would not
he said back down from anyone He would bet his last cent on
little Smoky He became slightly vociferative and more than a little
vainglorious and within half an hour he had once more staked all the
money he had in the world The number of men who wanted to bet with
him surprised him a little Also the fact that the Little Lost men were
betting on Smoky

Honey called him over to the bank and scolded him in tones much like her
name and finally gave him ten dollars which she wanted to wager on
his winning As he whirled away Marian beckoned impulsively and leaned
forward stretching out to him her closed hand

Heres ten she smiled just to show that the Little Lost stands by
its menand horses Put it on Smoky please When Bud was almost out
of easy hearing she called to him Ohwas that a five or a ten dollar
bill I gave you

Bud turned back unfolding the banknote A very tightly folded scrap of
paper slid into his palm

Oh all rightI have the five here in my pocket called Marian and
laughed quite convincingly Go on and run We wont be able to breathe
freely until the race is over

Wherefore Bud turned back puzzled and with his heart jumping For some
reason Marian had taken this means of getting a message into his hands
What it could be he did not conjecture but he had a vague unreasoning
hope that she trusted him and was asking him to help her somehow He
did not think that it concerned the race so he did not risk opening the
note then with so many people about

A slim narroweyed youth of about Buds weight was chosen to ride
Skeeter and together they went back over the course to the quarter
post with Dave to start them and two or three others to make sure that
the race was fair Smoky was full now of little prancing steps and held
his neck arched while his nostrils flared in excitement showing pink
within Skeeter persistently danced sidewise fighting the bit crazy to
run

Skeeter made two false starts and when the pistol was fired jumped
high into the air and forward shaking his head impatient against the
restraint his rider put upon him Halfway down the stretch he lunged
sidewise toward Smoky but that levelheaded little horse swerved and
went on shoulder to shoulder with the other At the very last Skeeter
rolled a pebble under his foot and stumbledand again Smoky came in
with his slaty nose in the lead

Pop rode into the centre of the yelling crowd his whiskers bristling
Shucks almighty he cried What fer ridin do yuh call that there
Jeff Hall that feller held Skeeter in worsen what you did yourself I
kin prove it I got a stop watch an I timed im I did An I kin tell
yuh the time yore horse made when he run agin Daves Boise Hes three
secondsyes by Christmas hes four seconds slower tday n what hes
ever run before What fer sport d you call that His voice went up and
cracked at the question mark like a boy in his early teens

Jeff stalked forward to Skeeters side Jake did you pull Skeeter
he demanded sternly Ill swan if this aint the bellyachiness bunch
I ever seen How about it Jake Did Skeeter do his durndest or didnt
he

Shore he did Jake testified warmly Ida beat too if he hadnt
stumbled right at the last Didnt yuh see him purty near go down And
wasnt he within six inches of beatin I leave it to the crowd

The crowd was full of argument and some bets were paid under protest
But they were paid just the same Burroback Valley insisted that the
main points of racing law should be obeyed to the letter Bud collected
his winnings the Scotch in him overlooking nothing whatever in the
shape of a dollar Then under cover of getting his smoking material he
dared bring out Marians note There were two lines in a fine even hand
on a cigarette paper and Bud relieved at her cleverness unfolded the
paper and read while he opened his bag of tobacco The lines were like
those in an oldfashioned copy book

Winners may be losers Empty pockets safe owner

And that was all Bud sifted tobacco into the paper rolled it into a
cigarette and smoked it to so short a stub that he burnt his lips
Then he dropped it beside his foot and ground it into the sand while he
talked

He would run Smoky no more that day he declared but next Sunday he
would give them all a chance to settle their minds and win back their
losings providing his horses ankle didnt go bad again with todays
running Pop Dave Jeff and a few other wise ones examined the weak
ankle and disagreed over the exact cause and nature of the weakness It
seemed all right Smoky did not flinch from rubbing though he did lift
his foot away from strange hands They questioned Bud who could offer
no positive information on the subject except that once he and Smoky
had rolled down a bluff together and Smoky had been lame for a while
afterwards

It did not occur to anyone to ask Bud which leg had been lamed and Bud
did not volunteer the detail An old sprain they finally decided and
Bud replaced his saddle got his chaps and coat from Jerry who was
smiling over an extra twentyfive dollars and rode over to give the
girls their winnings

He stayed for several minutes talking with them and hoping for a chance
to thank Marian for her friendly warning But there was none and he
rode away dissatisfied and wondering uneasily if Marian thought he was
really as friendly with Honey as that young lady made him appear to be

He was one of the first to ride back to the ranch and he turned Smoky
in the pasture and caught up Stopper to ride with Honey who said she
was going for a ride when the races were over and that if he liked to
go along she would show him the Sinks Bud had professed an eagerness
to see the Sinks which he did not feel until Marian had turned her head
toward Honey and said in her quiet voice

Why the Sinks You know that isnt safe country to ride in Honey

Thats why I want to ride there Honey retorted flippantly I hate
safe places and safe things

Marian had glanced at Budand it was that glance which he was
remembering now with a puzzled sense that like the note it had meant
something definite something vital to his own welfare if he could only
find the key First it was Hen then Jerry and now Marian all warning
him vaguely of danger into which he might stumble if he were not
careful

Bud was no fool but on the other hand he was not one to stampede
easily He had that steadfast courage perhaps which could face danger
and still maintain his natural calmjust as his mother had corrected
grammatical slips in the very sentences which told her of an impending
outbreak of Indians long ago Bud saddled Stopper and the horse which
Honey was to ride led them to the house and went inside to wait until
the girl was ready While he waited he playedand hoped that Marian
hearing would know that he played for her and that she would come and
explain the cryptic message Whether Marian heard and appreciated the
music or not she failed to appear and let him know It seemed to him
that she might easily have come into the room for a minute when she knew
he was there and let him have a chance to thank her and ask her just
what she meant

He was just finishing the AVE MARIA which Marian had likened to a breath
of cool air when Honey appeared in riding skirt and light shirtwaist
She looked very trim and attractive and Bud smiled upon her
approvingly and cut short the last strain by four beats which was one
way of letting Marian know that he considered her rather unappreciative



CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE SINKS

We can go through the pasture and cut off a couple of miles said
Honey when they were mounted I hope you dont think Im crazy wanting
a ride at this time of day after all the excitement weve had But
every Sunday is taken up with horseracing till late in the afternoon
and during the week no one has time to go And she added with a
sidelong look at him theres something about the Sinks that makes me
love to go there Uncle Dave wont let me go alone

Bud dismounted to pull down the two top bars of the pasture gate so that
their horses could step over A little way down the grassy slope Smoky
and Sunfish fed together the Little Lost horses grouped nearer the
creek

I love that little horse of yourswhy hes gone lame again
exclaimed Honey Isnt that a shame You oughtnt to run him if it does
that to him

He likes it said Bud carelessly as he remounted And so do I when I
can clean up the way I did today Im over three hundred dollars richer
right now than I was this morning

And next Sunday maybe youll be broke Honey added significantly
You never know how you are coming out I think Jeff let you win today
on purpose so youd bet it all again and lose Hes like that He dont
care how much he loses one day because he gets it back some other time
I dont like it Some of the boys never do get ahead and youll be in
the same fix if you dont look out

You didnt bring me along to lecture me I know said Bud with a
goodnatured smile What about the Sinks Is it a dangerous place
asMrs Morris says

Oh Marian She never does want me to come She thinks I ought to stay
in the house always the way she does The Sinks isisqueer There
are caves and then again deep holes straight down and tracks of
wildcats and lions And in some places you can hear gurgles and rumbles
I love to be there just at sundown because the shadows are spooky and
it makes you feeloh you knowkind of creepy up your back You dont
know what might happen Ido you believe in ghosts and haunted places
Bud

Id need a lot of scaring before I did Are the Sinks haunted

Noobut there are funny noises and people have got lost there Anyway
they never showed up afterwards The Indians claim its haunted She
smiled that baring smile of hers Do you want to turn around and go
back

Sure After weve had our ride and seen the sights And he added with
some satisfaction The moon s full tonight and no clouds

And I brought sandwiches Honey threw in as especial blessing Uncle
Dave will be mad I expect But Ive never seen the Sinks at night with
moonlight

She was quiet while the horses waded Sunk Creek and picked their way
carefully over a particularly rocky stretch beyond But what Id rather
do she said speaking from her thoughts which had evidently carried
forward in the silence is explore Catrock Canyon

Well why not if we have time Bud rode up alongside her Is it
far

Honey looked at him searchingly You must be stranger to these parts
she said disbelievingly Do you think you can make me swallow that

Bud looked at her inquiringly which forced her to go on

You must know about Catrock Canyon Bud Birnie Dont try to make me
believe you dont

I dont I never heard of it before that I remember What is it makes
you want to explore it

Honey studied him Youre the queerest specimen I ever did see she
exclaimed pettishly Why its not going to hurt you to admit you know
Catrock Canyon isunexplorable

Oh So you want to explore it because its unexplorable Well why is
it unexplorable

Honey looked around her at the dry sageland they were crossing Oh you
make me TIRED she said bluntly with something of the range roughness
in her voice Because it is thats all

Then Id like to explore it myself Bud declared

For one thing Honey dilated theres no way to get in there Up on
the ridge this side where the rock is that throws a shadow like a cats
head on the opposite wall you can look down a ways But the two sides
come so close together at the top that you cant see the bottom of the
canyon at all Ive been on the ridge where I could see the cats head

Bud glanced speculatively up at the sun and Honey catching his
meaning shook her head and smiled

If we get into the Sinks and back today they will do enough talking
about it or Uncle Dave will and Marian II thought perhaps youd be
able to tell me aboutCatrock Canyon

Im able to say I dont know a thing about it If no one can get into
it I should think thats about all isnt it

Yesyoud think so Honey agreed enigmatically and began to talk
of the racing that day and of the dance and of other dances and other
races yet to come Bud discussed these subjects for a while and then
asked boldly Whens Lew coming back

Lew Honey shot a swift glance at him Why She looked ahead at the
forbidding craggy hills toward which she had glanced when she spoke of
Catrock Why I dont know How should I

Bud saw that he had spoken unwisely I was thinking hed maybe hate
to miss another running match like today he explained guilelessly
Everybody and his dog seemed to be there today and everybody had
money up All he modified except the Muleshoe boys I didnt see any
of them

You wont Honey told him with some emphasis Uncle Dave and the
Muleshoe are on the outs They never come around except for mail and
things from the store And most always they send Hen Uncle Dave and
Dirk Tracy had an awful row last winter It was next thing to a killing
So of course the outfits aint on friendly terms

This was more than Pop had gossiped to Bud and since the whole thing
was of no concern to him and Honey plainly objected to talking about
Marians husband he was quite ready to fix his interest once more upon
the Sinks He was surprised when they emerged from a cluster of small
sagecovered knolls directly upon the edge of what at first sight
seemed to be another dry river bedsprawled wider perhaps with
irregular arms thrust back into the less sterile land They rode down a
steep rocky trail and came out into the Sinks

It was an odd forbidding place and the farther up the gravelly bottom
they rode the more forbidding it became Bud thought that in the time
when Indians were dangerous as shebears the Sinks would not be a place
where a man would want to ride There were too many jutting crags too
many unsuspected black holes that led backno one knew just where

Honey led the way to an irregular circle of waterwashed cobbles and
Bud peered down fifty feet to another dry gravelly bottom seemingly a
duplicate of the upper surface She rode on past other caves and let
him look down into other holes There were faint rumblings in some of
these but in none was there any water showing save in stagnant pools in
the rock where the rain had fallen

Theres one cave I like to go into said Honey at last Its a little
farther on but we have time enough Theres a spring inside and we
can eat our sandwiches It isnt darkthere are openings to the top and
lots of funny winding passages That she finished thrillingly is
the place the Indians claim is haunted

Bud did not shudder convincingly and they rode slowly forward picking
their way among the rocks The cave yawned wide open to the sun which
hung on the top of Catrock Peak They dismounted anchored the reins
with rocks and went inside

When Bud had been investigative Buddy he had explored more caves than
he could count He had filched candles from his mother and had crept
back and back until the candle flame flickered warning that he was
nearing the damps Indians always did believe caves were haunted
probably because they did not understand the damps and thought evil
spirits had taken those who went in and never returned Buddy had once
been lost in a cave for four harrowing hours and had found his way out
by sheer luck passing the skeleton of an Indian and taking the tomahawk
as a souvenir

Wherefore this particular cave with a spring back fifty feet from the
entrance where a shaft of sunlight struck the rock through some obscure
slit in the rock had no thrill for him But the floor was of fine
white sand and the ceiling was knobby and grotesque and he was quite
willing to sit there beside the spring and eat two sandwiches and talk
foolishness with Honey using that part of his mind which was not busy
with the complexities of winning money on the speed of his horses when
three horses represented his entire business capital and with wondering
what was wrong with Burroback Valley that three persons of widely
different viewpoints had felt it necessary to caution himand had
couched their admonitions in such general terms that he could not feel
the force of their warning

He was thinking back along his life to where false alarms of Indian
outbreaks had played a very large part in the Tomahawks affairs and
how little of the ranch work would ever have been done had they listened
to every calamity howler that came along Honey was talking and he was
answering partly at random when she suddenly laughed and got up

You must be in love Bud Birnie You just said yes when I asked you
if you didnt think water snakes would be coming out this fall with
their stripes running round them instead of lengthwise You didnt hear
a wordnow did you

I heard music Bud lied gallantly and I knew it was your voice Id
probably say yes if you asked me whether the moon wouldnt look better
with a ruffle around it

Ill say the moon will be wondering where we are if we dont start
back The suns down

Bud got up from sitting crosslegged like a Turk helped Honey to her
feetand felt her fingers clinging warmly to his own He led the way
to the caves mouth not looking at her Great sunset he observed
carelessly glancing up at the ridge while he held her horse for her to
mount

Honey showed that she was perfectly at home in the saddle She rode on
ahead leaving Bud to mount and follow He was just swinging leisurely
into the saddle when Stopper threw his head around glancing back
toward the level just beyond the cave At the same instant Bud heard the
familiar unmistakable swish of a rope headed his way

He flattened himself along Stoppers left shoulder as the loop settled
and tightened on the saddle horn and dropped on to the ground as
Stopper whirled automatically to the right and braced himself against
the strain Bud turned half kneeling his gun in his hand ready for the
shot he expected would follow the rope But Stopper was in actionthe
best ropehorse the Tomahawk had ever owned For a few seconds he stood
braced his neck arched his eyes bright and watchful Then he leaped
forward straight at the horse and the rider who was in the act of
leveling his gun The horse hesitated taken unaware by the onslaught
When he started to run Stopper was already passing him turning sharply
to the right again so that the rope raked the horses front legs Two
jumps and Stopper had stopped faced the horse and stood braced again
his ears perked knowingly while he waited for the flop

It camejust as it always did come when Stopper got action on the end
of a rope Horse and rider came down together They would not get up
until Bud wished ithe could trust Stopper for thatso Bud walked over
to the heap his gun ready for actionand that too could be trusted
to perform with what speed and precision was necessary There would be
no hasty shooting however Buddy had learned to save his bullets for
real need when ammunition was not to be had for the asking and grownup
Bud had never outgrown the habit

He picked up the fellows sixshooter which he had dropped when he fell
and stood sizing up the situation

By the neckerchief drawn across his face it was a straight case of
holdup Bud stooped and yanked off the mask and looked into the glaring
eyes of one whom he had never before seen

Well how dyuh like it far as youve got Bud asked curiously
Think you were holding up a pilgrim or what

Just then BINGGG sang a rifle bullet from the ridge above the cave
Bud looked that way and spied a man standing half revealed against the
rosy clouds that were already dulling as dusk crept up from the low
ground It was a long shot for a sixshooter but Buddy used to shoot
antelope almost that far so Bud lifted his arm and straightened it
just as if he were pointing a finger at the man and fired He had the
satisfaction of seeing the figure jerk backward and go off over the
ridge in a stooping kind of run

Hed better hurry back if he wants another shot at me Bud grinned
Itll be so dark down here in a minute he couldnt pick me up with his
front sight if I wasas big a fool as you are How about it Ill just
lead you into camp I thinkbut you sure as hell couldnt get a job
roping gateposts on the strength of this little exhibition

He went over to Stopper and untied his own rope giving an approving pat
to that businesslike animal Hope your leg isnt broken or anything
he said to the man when he returned and passed the loop over the
fellows head and shoulders drawing it rather snugly around his body
and pinning his arms at the elbows It would be kind of unpleasant if
they happen to take a notion to make you walk all the way to jail

He beckoned Stopper who immediately moved up slackening the rope The
thrown horse drew up his knees gave a preliminary heave and scrambled
to his feet Bud taking care that the man was pulled free and safe The
fellow stood up sulkily defiant unable to rest much of his weight on
his left leg

Bud had ten busy minutes and it was not until they were both mounted
and headed for Little Lost the captive with his arms tied behind him
his feet tied together under the horse which Bud led that Bud had time
to wonder what it was all about Then he began to look for Honey who
had disappeared But in the softened light of the rising moon mingling
with the afterglow of sunset he saw the deep imprints of her horses
hoofs where he had galloped homeward Bud did not think she ran away
because she was frightened she had seemed too sure of herself for that
She had probably gone for help

A swift suspicion that the attack might have been made from jealousy
died when Bud looked again at his prisoner The man was swarthy low of
browpart Indian by the look of him Honey would never give the fellow
a second thought So that brought him to the supposition that robbery
had been intended and the inference was made more logical when Bud
remembered that Marian had warned him against something of the sort
Probably he and Honey had been followed into the Sinks and even though
Bud had not seen this man at the races his partner up on the ridge
might have been there It was all very simple and Bud having arrived
at the obvious conclusion touched Stopper into a lope and arrived at
Little Lost just as Dave Truman and three of his men were riding down
into Sunk Creek ford on their way to the Sinks They pulled up staring
hard at Dave and his captive Dave spoke first

Honey said you was waylaid and robbed or killedboth we took it from
her account Howd yuh come to get the best of it so quick

Why his horse got tangled up in the rope and fell down and fell on
top of him Bud explained cheerfully I was bringing him in Hes
a bad citizen I should judge but he didnt do me any damage as it
turned out so I dont know what to do with him Ill just turn him over
to you I think

Hell I dont want him Dave protested Ill pass him along to the
sheriffhe may know something about him Nelse and Charlie you take
and run him in to Crater and turn him over to Kline You tell Kline what
he doneor tried to do Was he alone Bud

He had a partner up on the ridge so far off I couldnt swear to him if
I saw him face to face I took a shot at him and I think I nicked him
He ducked and there werent any more rifle bullets coming my way

You nicked him with your sixshooter And him so far off you couldnt
recognize him again Dave looked at Bud sharply Thats purty good
shootin strikes me

Well he stood up against the skyline and he wasnt more than
seventyfive yards Bud explained Ive dropped antelope that far
plenty of times The light was bad this evening

Antelope Dave repeated meditatively and winked at his men All
right Budwell let it stand at antelope Boys you hit for Crater
with this fellow You ought to make it there and back by tomorrow noon
all right

Nelse took the lead rope from Bud and the two started off up the creek
meaning to strike the road from Little Lost to Crater the county seat
beyond Gold Gap mountains Bud rode on to the ranch with his boss and
tried to answer Daves questions satisfactorily without relating his own
prowess or divulging too much of Stoppers skill which was something of
a problem for his wits

Honey ran out to meet him and had to be assured over and over that he
was not hurt and that he had lost nothing but his temper and the ride
home with her in the moonlight She was plainly upset and anxious that
he should not think her cowardly to leave him that way

I looked back and saw a man throwing his rope and youit looked as if
he had dragged you off the horse I was sure I saw you falling So I ran
my horse all the way home to get Uncle Dave and the boys she told
him tremulously And then she added with her tantalizing half smile I
believe that horse of mine could beat Smoky or Skeeter if I was scared
that bad at the beginning of a race

Bud in sheer gratitude for her anxiety over him patted Honeys hand
and told her she must have broken the record all right and that she
had done exactly the right thing And Honey went to bed happy that
night



CHAPTER FOURTEEN EVEN MUSHROOMS HELP

Bud wanted to have a little confidential talk with Marian He hoped that
she would be willing to tell him a great deal more than could be written
on one side of a cigarette paper and he was curious to hear what it
was On the other hand he wanted somehow to let her know that he was
anxious to help her in any way possible She needed help of that he was
sure

Lew returned on Tuesday with a vile temper and rheumatism in his left
shoulder so that he could not work but stayed around the house and too
evidently made his wife miserable by his presence On Wednesday morning
Marian had her hair dressed so low over her ears that she resembled a
lady of old Colonial daysbut she did not quite conceal from Buds
keen eyes the ugly bruise on her temple She was pale and her lips were
compressed as if she were afraid to relax lest she burst out in tears or
in a violent denunciation of some kind Bud dared not look at her nor
at Lew who sat glowering at Buds right hand He tried to eat tried to
swallow his coffee and finally gave up the attempt and left the table

In getting up he touched Lews shoulder with his elbow and Lew let out
a bellow of pain and an oath and leaned away from him his right hand
up to ward off another hurt

Pardon me I forgot your rheumatism Bud apologized perfunctorily his
face going red at the epithet Marian coming toward him with a plate
of biscuits looked him full in the eyes and turned her glance to her
husbands back while her lips curled in the bitterest the most scornful
smile Bud had ever seen on a womans face She did not speakspeech
was impossible before that tableful of menbut Bud went out feeling as
though she had told him that her contempt for Lew was beyond words and
that his rheumatism brought no pity whatever

Wednesday passed Thursday came and still there was no chance to speak
a word in private The kitchen drudge was hedged about by open ears and
curious eyes and save at mealtime she was invisible to the men unless
they glimpsed her for a moment in the kitchen door

Thursday brought a thunder storm with plenty of rain and in the drizzle
that held over until Friday noon Bud went out to an old calf shed
which he had discovered in the edge of the pasture and gathered his
neckerchief full of mushrooms Bud hated mushrooms but he carried them
to the machine shed and waited until he was sure that Honey was in the
sitting room playing the pianoand hitting what Bud called a blue note
now and thenand that Lew was in the bunkhouse with the other men and
Dave and old Pop were in Pops shack Then and then only Bud took long
steps to the kitchen door carrying his mushrooms as tenderly as though
they were eggs for hatching

Marian was up to her dimpled elbows in bread dough when he went in
Honey was still groping her way lumpily through the Blue Danube Waltz
and Bud stood so that he could look out through the whitecurtained
window over the kitchen table and make sure that no one approached the
house unseen

Here are some mushrooms he said guardedly lest his voice should
carry to Honey Theyre just an excuse Far as Im concerned you can
feed them to the hogs I like things clean and natural and wholesome
myself I came to find out whats the matter Mrs Morris Is there
anything I can do I took the hint you gave me in the note Sunday and
I discovered right away you knew what you were talking about That was a
holdup down in the Sinks It couldnt have been anything else But
they wouldnt have got anything I didnt have more than a dollar in my
pocket

Marian turned her head and listened to the piano and glanced up at
him

I also like things clean and natural and wholesome she said quietly
Thats why I tried to put you on your guard You dont seem to fit in
somehow withthe surroundings I happen to know that the races held
here every Sunday are just thinly veiled attempts to cheat the unwary
out of every cent they have I should advise you Mr Birnie to be very
careful how you bet on any horses

I shall Bud smiled Pop gave me some good advice too about running
horses He says Its every fellow for himself and mercy toward none
Im playing by their rule and Pop expects to make a few dollars too
He said hed stand by me

Oh He did Marians voice puzzled Bud She kneaded the bread
vigorously for a minute Dont depend too much on Pop Hesvariable
And dont go around with a dollar in your pocketunless you dont mind
losing that dollar There are men in this country who would willingly
dispense with the formality of racing a horse in order to get your
money

YesIve discovered one informal method already I wish I knew how I
could help YOU

Help mein what way Marian glanced out of the window again as if
that were a habit she had formed

I dont know I wish I did I thought perhaps you had some trouble
thatMy mother had the same look in her eyes when we came back to
the ranch after some Indian trouble and found the house burned and
everything destroyed but the ground itself She didnt say anything
much She just began helping father plan how wed manage until we could
get material and build another cabin and make our supplies hold out
She didnt complain But her eyes had the same look Ive seen in yours
Mrs Morris So I feel as if I ought to help you just as Id help
mother Buds face had been red and embarrassed when he began but his
earnestness served to erase his selfconsciousness

Youre differentjust like mother he went on when Marian did not
answer You dont belong here drudging in this kitchen I never saw a
woman doing a mans work before They ought to have a man cooking for
all these hulking men

Oh the kitchen Marian exclaimed impatiently I dont mind the
cooking Thats the least

It isnt right just the same II dont suppose thats it altogether
Im not trying to find out what the trouble isbut I wish youd
remember that Im ready to do anything in the world that I can You
wont misunderstand that Im sure

Noo said Marian slowly But you see theres nothing that you can
doexcept perhaps make things worse for me Then to lighten that
statement she smiled at him Just now you can help me very much if you
will go in and play something besides the Blue Danube Waltz Ive had
to listen to that ever since Honora sent away for the music with the
winters grocery order last October Tell Honora you got her some
mushrooms And dont trust anyone If you must bet on the horses do so
with your eyes open Theyre cheatsand worse some of them

Buds glance followed hers through the window that overlooked the
corrals and the outbuildings Lew was coming up to the house with a
slicker over his head to keep off the drizzle

Well remember Id do anything for you that Id do for my mother or my
sister Dulcie And I wish youd call on me just as they would if you
get in a pinch and need me If I know youll do that Ill feel a lot
better satisfied

If I need you be sure that I shall let you know And Ill say
that Its a comfort to have met one white man Marian assured him
hurriedly her anxious eyes on her approaching husband

She need not have worried over his coming so far as Bud was concerned
For Bud was in the sittingroom and had picked Honey off the piano
stool had given her a playful shake and was playing the Blue Danube
as its composer intended that it should be played when Lew entered the
kitchen and kicked the door shut behind him

Bud spent the forenoon conscientiously trying to teach Honey that the
rests are quite as important to the tempo of a waltz measure as are the
notes Honeys talent for music did not measure up to her talent for
coquetry she received about five dollars worth of instruction and no
blandishments whatever and although she no doubt profited thereby at
last she balked and put her lazy white hands over her ears and refused
to listen to Buds inexorable One two three one two threeand one
two three Whereupon Bud laughed and returned to the bunkhouse

He arrived in the middle of a heated argument over Jeff Halls tactics
in racing Skeeter and immediately was called upon for his private
personal opinion of Sundays race Buds private personal opinion
being exceedingly private and personal he threw out a skirmish line of
banter

Smoky could run circles around that Skeeter horse he boasted and
Jeffs manner of riding was absolutely unimportant nonessential and
immaterial He was mighty glad that holdup man had fallen down last
Sunday before he got his hands on any money because that money was
going to talk long and loud to Jeff Hall next Sunday Now that Bud had
started running his horse for money working for wages looked foolish
and unprofitable He was now working merely for healthful exercise and
to pass the time away between Sundays His real mission in life he had
discovered was to teach Jeffs bunch that gambling is a sin

The talk was carried enthusiastically to the dinner table where Bud
ignored the scowling proximity of Lew and repeated his boasts in a
revised form as an indirect means of letting Marian know that he meant
to play the Burroback game in the Burroback wayor as nearly as he
couldand keep his honesty more or less intact He did not think she
would approve but he wanted her to know

Once when Buddy was fifteen four thoroughbred cows and four calves
disappeared mysteriously from the home ranch just before the calves had
reached branding age Buddy rode the hills and the valleys every spare
minute for two weeks in search of them and finally away over the ridge
where an undesirable neighbor was getting a start in cattle Buddy found
the calves in a fenced field with eight calves belongingperhapsto
the undesirable neighbor

Buddy did not ride down to the ranch and accuse the neighbor of stealing
the calves Instead he painstakingly sought a weak place in the fence
made a very accidental looking hole and drove out the twelve calves
took them over the ridge to Tomahawk and left them in a high mountain
meadow pretty well surrounded by matted thickets There because there
was good grass and running water the calves seemed quite as happy as in
the field

Then Buddy hurried home and brought a branding iron and a fresh horse
and by working very hard and fast he somehow managed to plant a deep
tomahawk brand on each one of the twelve calves He returned home very
late and very proud of himself and met his father face to face as
he was putting away the iron Explanations and a broken harness strap
mingled painfully in Buddys memory for a long time afterwards but the
full effect of the beating was lost because Buddy happened to hear Bob
Birnie confide to mother that the lad had served the old cattlethief
right and that any man who could start with one thoroughbred cow and
in four years have sufficient increase from that cow to produce eight
calves a season ought to lose them all

Buddy had not needed his fathers opinion to strengthen his own
conviction that he had performed a worthy deed and one of which no man
need feel ashamed Indeed Buddy considered the painful incident of
the buggy strap a parental effort at official discipline and held no
particular grudge against his father after the welts had disappeared
from his person

Wherefore Bud the man held unswervingly to the ethical standard of
Buddy the boy If Burroback Valley was scheming to fleece a stranger at
their races and rob him by force if he happened to win then Bud felt
justified in getting every dollar possible out of the lot of them At
any rate he told himself he would do his darndest It was plain enough
that Pop was trying to make an opportunity to talk confidentially but
with a dozen men on the place it was easy enough to avoid being alone
without arousing the old mans suspicions Marian had told him to
trust no one and Bud with his usual thoroughness applied the warning
literally

Sunday morning he caught up Smoky and rode him to the corral Smoky
had recovered from his lameness and while Bud groomed him for the
afternoons running the men of Little Lost gathered round him and
offered advice and encouragement and even volunteered to lend him money
if he needed it But Bud told them to put up their own bets and never
to worry about him Their advice and their encouragement however he
accepted as cheerfully as they were given

Think yuh can beat Skeeter young feller Pop shambled up to inquire
anxiously his beard brushing Buds shoulder while he leaned close
Remember what I told ye You stick by me an Ill stick by you You
shook on it dont forgit that young feller

Bud had forgotten but he made haste to redeem his promise Last
Sunday Pop I had to play it alone Todaywell if you want to make an
honest dollar you know what to do dont you

Sho Im bettin on yore horse tday an mind ye I want to see my
money doubled But that there lameness in his left hind ankleI dont
see but what that kinda changes my opinion a little mite You shore he
wont quit on ye in the race now Dont lie to ole Pop young feller

Say He s the gamest little horse in the state Pop He never has
quit and he never will Bud stood up and laid a friendly hand on the
old fellows shoulder Pop Im running him today to win Thats the
truth Im going to put all Ive got on him Is that good enough

Shucks almighty Thats good enough fer meplenty good fer me Pop
cackled and trotted off to find someone who had little enough faith in
Smoky to wager a twotoone against him

It seemed to Bud that the crowd was larger than that of a week ago and
there was no doubt whatever that the betting was more feverish and that
Jeff meant that day to retrieve his losses Bud passed up a very good
chance to win on other races and centred all his betting on Smoky He
had been throughout the week boastful and full of confidence and now he
swaggered and lifted his voice in arrogant challenge to all and sundry
His three hundred dollars was on the race and incidentally he never
left Smoky from the time he led him up from pasture until the time came
when he and Jeff Hall rode side by side down to the quarter post

They came up in a small whirlwind of speed and dust and Smoky was under
the wire to his ears when Skeeters nose showed beyond it Little Lost
was jubilant Jeff Hall and his backers were not

Buds three hundred dollars had in less than a minute increased to a
little over nine hundred though all his bets had been moderate By the
time he had collected his pockets were full and his cocksureness had
increased to such an unbearable crowing that Jeff Halls eyes were
venomous as a snakes Jeff had been running to win that day and he
had taken odds on Skeeter that had seemed to him perfectly safe

Ill run yuh horse for horse he bellowed and spat out an epithet that
sent Bud at him whitelipped

Damn yuh ride down to the quarter post and Ill show you some
running Bud yelled back And after youve swallowed dust all the way
up the track you go with me to where the women cant see and Ill lick
the living tar outa you

Jeff swore and wheeled Skeeter toward the starting post beckoning
Bud to follow And Bud hastily tucking in a flapping bulge of striped
shirt went after him At that moment he was not Bud but Buddy in one
of his fighting moods with his plans forgotten while he avenged an
insult

Men lined up at the wire to judge for themselves the finish and Dave
Truman rode alone to start them No one doubted but that the start would
be fairJeff and Bud would see to that

For the first time in months the reinends stung Smokys flanks when he
was in his third jump Just once Bud struck and was ashamed of the blow
as it fell Smoky did not need that urge but he flattened his ears and
came down the track a full length ahead of Skeeter and held the pace
to the wire and beyond where he stopped in a swirl of sand and went
prancing back ready for another race if they asked it of him

Guess Davell have to bring out Boise and take the swellin outa that
singin kids pocket a hardfaced man shouted as Jeff slid off
Skeeter and went over to where his cronies stood bunched and conferring
earnestly together

Not today he neednt Ive had all the excitement I want and Id
like to have time to count my money before I lose it Bud retorted
Next Sunday if its a clear day and the sign is right I might run
against Boise if its worth my while Say Jeff seeing youre playing
hard luck I wont lick you for what you called me And just to show my
hearts right Ill lend you Skeeter to ride home Or if you want to buy
him back you can have him for sixty dollars or such a matter He s a
nice little horseif you arent in a hurry



CHAPTER FIFTEEN WHY BUD MISSED A DANCE

Bud youre fourteen kinds of a damn fool and I can prove it Jerry
announced without prelude of any kind save perhaps the viciousness
with which he thrust a pitchfork into a cock of hay The two were
turning over haycocks that had been drenched with another unwelcome
storm and they had not been talking much Forking soggy hay when
the sun is blistering hot and great longbilled mosquitoes are boring
indefatigably into the back of ones neck is not a pastime conducive to
polite and animated conversation

Fly at it Bud invited resting his fork while he scratched a smarting
shoulder But you can skip some of the evidence I know seven of the
kinds and I plead guilty Any ablebodied man who will deliberately
make a barbecue of himself for a gang of bloodthirsty insects ought to
be hanged Whats the rest

You can call that mild Jerry stated severely Bud youre playing to
lose the shirt off your back Youve got a hundred dollar forfeit up
on next Sundays running match so youll run if you have to race Boise
afoot Thats all right if you want the riskbut did it ever occur to
you that if all the coin in the neighborhood is collected in one mans
pocket therell be about as many fellows as there are losers that will
lay awake till sunup figuring how to heel him and ride off with the
roll I aint overstocked with courage myself Id rather be broke in
Burroback Valley than owner of wealth Its healthier

He thrust his fork into another settled heap lifted it clear of the
ground with one heave of his muscular shoulders and heard within a
strident buzzing He held the hay poised until a mottled gray
snake writhed into view its ugly jaws open and its fangs showing
malevolently

Grab him with your fork Bud Jerry said coolly A rattlerthe
valleys full of emsome of em s human

The snake was dispatched and the two went on to the next haycock
Bud was turning over more than the hay and presently he spoke more
seriously than was his habit with Jerry

Youre full enough of warnings Jerry What do you want me to do about
it

Drift Jerry advised Theres moral diseases just as catching as
smallpox This part of the country has been settled up by men that came
here first because they wanted to hide out Theyve slipped into darn
crooked ways and the rest has either followed suit or quit All through
this rough country Its the sameover in the Black Rim across Thunder
Mountains and beyond that to the Sawtooth a man thats honest is a
man thats off his range Id like to see you pull outbefore youre
planted

Bud looked at Jerry studied him feature by feature Then what are you
doing here he demanded bluntly Why havent you pulled out

Me Jerry bit his lip Bud Im going to take a chance and tell you
the Godstruth I dassent Im protected here because I keep my mouth
shut and because they know Ive got to or they can hand me over I had
some trouble Im on the dodge and Little Lost is right handy to the
Sinks andCatrock Canyon There aint a sheriff in Idaho that would
have one chance in a thousand of getting me here But yousay He
faced Bud You aint on the dodge too are yuh

Nope Bud grinned Over at the Muleshoe they seemed to think I was I
just struck out for myself and I want to show up at home some day with
a stake I made myself Its just a little argument with my dad that I
want to settle And he added frankly I seem to have struck the
right place to make money quickly The very fact that theyre a bunch of
crooks makes my conscience clear on the point of running my horse Im
not cheating them out of a cent If Jeffs horse is faster than Smoky
Jeff is privileged to let him out and win if he can It isnt my fault
if he s playing to let me win from the whole bunch in the hope that
he can hold me up afterwards and get the roll Its straight give and
takeand so far Ive been taking

Jerry worked for a while moodily silent What Id like is to see you
take the trail while the takins good he said later Ive got to
keep my mouth shut But I like yuh Bud I hate like hell to see you
walking straight into a trap

Say Im as easily trapped as a mountain lion Bud told him
confidently

Whereat Jerry looked at him pityingly You going to that dance up at
Morgans

Sure Im going to take Honey andI think Mrs Morris if she decides
to go Honey mentioned it last night Why

Oh nothing Jerry shouldered his fork and went off to where a jug of
water was buried in the hay beside a certain boulder which marked
the spot He drank long stopped for a short gossip with Charley who
strolled over for a drink and went to work on another row

Bud watched him and wondered if Jerry had changed rows to avoid
further talk with him and whether Jerry had merely been trying to get
information from him and had either learned what he wanted to know
or had given up the attempt Bud reviewed mentally their desultory
conversation and decided that he had accidentally been very discreet
The only real bit of information he had given Jerry was the fact that he
was not on the dodgea criminal in fear of the lawand that surely
could harm no man

That he intended to run against Boise on Sunday was common knowledge
also that he had a hundred dollar forfeit up on the race And that he
was going to a dance with Honey was of no consequence that he could see

Bud was beginning to discount the vague warnings he had received Unless
something definite came within his knowledge he would go about his
business exactly as if Burroback Valley were a churchgoing community
He would not drift

But after all he did not go to the dance with Honey or with anyone He
came to the suppertable freshly shaved and dressed for the occasion
ate hungrily and straightway became a very sick young man He did not
care if there were forty dances in the Valley that night His head was
splitting his stomach was in a turmoil He told Jerry to go ahead with
Honey and if he felt better after a while he would follow Jerry at
first was inclined to scepticism and accused Bud of crawfishing at the
last minute But within ten minutes Bud had convinced him so completely
that Jerry insisted upon staying with him By then Bud was too sick to
care what was being done or who did it So Jerry stayed

Honey came to the bunkhouse in her dance finery was met in the doorway
by Jerry and was told that this was no place for a lady and reluctantly
consented to go without her escort

A light shone dimly in the kitchen after the dancers had departed
wherefore Jerry guessed that Marian had not gone with the others
and that he could perhaps get hold of mustard for an emetic or a
plasterJerry was not sure which remedy would be best and the
patient wanting to die would not be finicky He found Marian measuring
something drop by drop into half a glass of water She turned saw who
had entered and carefully counted three more drops corked the bottle
tightly and slid it into her apron pocket and held out the glass to
Jerry

Give him this she said in a soft undertone Im sorry but I hadnt
a chance to say a word to the boy and so I couldnt think of any other
way of making sure he would not go up to Morgans I put something into
his coffee to make him sick You may tell him Jerry if you like I
should if I had the chance This will counteract the effects of the
other so that he will be all right in a couple of hours

Jerry took the glass and stood looking at her steadily That sure was
one way to do it he observed with a quirk of the lips Its none of
my business and I aint asking any questions but

Very sensible Im sure Marian interrupted him I wish hed leave
the country Cant you

No I told him to pull out and he just laughed at me I knowed they
was figuring on ganging together tonight

Marian closed her hands together with a gesture of impatience Jerry I
wish I knew just how bad you are she exclaimed Do you dare stand by
him Because this thing is only beginning I couldnt bear to see him go
up there tonight absolutely unsuspectingand so I made him sick Tell
that to anyone and you can make me

Say I aint a damned skunk Jerry muttered Im bad enough maybe
At any rate you think so Then as usually happened Jerry decided to
hold his tongue He turned and lifted the latch of the screen door You
sure made a good job of it he grinned Ill go an pour this into Bud
fore he loses his boots

He did so and saved Buds boots and half a nights sleep besides
Moreover when Bud fully recovered searched his memory of that supper
and decided that it was the sliced cucumbers that had disagreed with
him Jerry gravely assured him that it undoubtedly was the combination
of cucumber and custard pie and that Bud was lucky to be alive after
such reckless eating

Having missed the dance altogether Bud looked forward with impatience
to Sunday It is quite possible that others shared with him that
impatience though we are going to adhere for a while to Buds point of
view and do no more than guess at the thoughts hidden behind the fair
words of certain men in the Valley

Pops state of mind we are privileged to know for Pop was seen making
daily pilgrimage to the pasture where he could watch Smoky limping
desultorily here and there with Stopper and Sunfish On Saturday
afternoon Bud saw Pop trying to get his hands on Smoky presumably to
examine the lame ankle But three legs were all Smoky needed to keep him
out of Pops reach Pop forgot his rheumatism and ran pretty fast for a
man his age and when Bud arrived Pops vocabulary had limbered up to a
more surprising activity than his legs

Want to bet on yourself Pop Bud called out when Pop was running
back and forth hopefully trying to corner Smoky in a rocky draw Im
willing to risk a dollar on you anyway

Pop whirled upon him and hurled sentences not written in the book of
Parlor Entertainment The gist of it was that he had been trying all
the week to have a talk with Bud and Bud had plainly avoided him after
promising to act upon Pops advice and run so as to make some money

Well I made some Bud defended If you didnt its just because you
didnt bet strong enough

I want to look at that horses hind foot Pop insisted

No use Hes too lame to run against Boise You can see that yourself

Pop eyed Bud suspiciously pulling his beard Are you fixin to
doublecross me young feller he wanted to know I went and made some
purty big bets on this race If you think yore goin to fool ole Pop
you ll wish you hadnt You got enemies already in this valley lemme
tell yuh The Muleshoe aint any bunch to fool with and Im willing
to say t theyre laying fer yuh They think he added shrewdly t
youre a spotter or something Air yuh

Of course I am Pop Ive spotted a way to make money and have
fun while I do it Bud looked at the old man remembered Marians
declaration that Pop was not very reliable and groped mentally for a
way to hearten the old man without revealing anything better kept to
himself such as the immediate effect of a horse hair tied just above
a horses hoof also the immediate result of removing that hair
Wherefore he could not think of much to say except that he would not
attempt to run a lame horse against Boise

All I can say is tomorrow morning you keep your eyes open Pop and
your tongue between your teeth And no matter what comes up you use
your own judgment

Tomorrow morning Pop showed that he was taking Buds advice When the
crowd began to gathermuch earlier than usual by the way and much
larger than any crowd Bud had seen in the valleyPop was trotting here
and there listening and pulling his whiskers and eyeing Bud sharply
whenever that young man appeared in his vicinity

Bud led Smoky up at noonand Smoky was still lame Dave looked at him
and at Bud and grinned I guess that forfeit moneys mine he said in
his laconic way No use running that horse I could beat him afoot

This was but the beginning Others began to banter and jeer Bud Jeffs
crowd taunting him with malicious glee The singin kid was going to
have some of the swelling taken out of his head they chortled He had
been crazy enough to put up a forfeit on todays race and now his
horse had just three legs to run on

Git out afoot kid Jeff Hall yelled If you kin run half as fast as
you kin talk youll beat Boise four lengths in the first quarter

Bud retorted in kind and led Smoky around the corral as if he hoped
that the horse would recover miraculously just to save his masters
pride The crowd hooted to see how Smoky hobbled along barely touching
the toe of his lame foot to the ground Bud led him back to the manger
piled with new hay and faced the jeering crowd belligerently Bud
noticed several of the Muleshoe men in the crowd no doubt drawn to
Little Lost by the talk of Buds spectacular winnings for two Sundays
Hen was there and Day Masters and Cub Also there were strangers who
had ridden a long way judging by their sweaty horses In the midst of
the talk and laughter Dave led out Boise freshly curried and brushed and
arching his neck proudly

No use Bud he said tolerantly I guess youre set back that forfeit
moneyunless you want to go through the motions of running a lame
horse

No sir Im not going to hand over any forfeit money without making
a fight for it Bud told him anger showing in his voice Im no such
piker as that I wont run Smoky lame as he is Bud probably nudged
his own ribs when he said thatbut if youll make it a mile Ill
catch up my old buckskin packhorse and run the race with him by
thunder Hes not the quickest horse in the world but he sure can run a
long while

They yelled and slapped one another on the back and otherwise comported
themselves as though a great joke had been told them never dreaming
poor fools that a costly joke was being perpetrated

Go it kid You run your packhorse and Ill rive yuh five to one on
him a friend of Jeff Halls yelled derisively

Ill just take you up on that and Ill make it one hundred dollars
Bud shouted back Id run a turtle for a quarter at those odds

The crowd was having hysterics when Bud straddled a Little Lost horse
and loudly declaring that he would bring back Sunfish led Smoky
limping back to the pasture He returned soon leading the buckskin The
crowd surged closer gave Sunfish a glance and whooped again Buds face
was red with apparent anger his eyes snapped He faced them defiantly
his hand on Sunfishs thin straggling mane

Youre such good sports youll surely appreciate my feelings when I
say that this horse is mine and Im going to run him and back him to
win he cried I may be a darn fool but Im no piker I know what
this horse can do when I try to catch him up on a frosty morningand
Im going to see if he cant go just as fast and just as long when Im
on him as he can when Im after him

Well go yuh kid Ill bet yuh five to one a man shouted You name
the amount yourself

Fifty said Bud and the man nodded and jotted down the amount

Bud youre a damn fool Ill bet you a hundred and make it ten to
one drawled Dave stroking Boises face affectionately while he looked
superciliously at Sunfish standing half asleep in the clamor with his
head sagging at the end of his long ewe neck But if youll take my
advice go turn that fool horse back in the pasture and run the bay if
you must run something

The bays a rope horse I dont want to spoil him by running him That
little horse saved my life down in the Sinks No Sunfish has run times
enough from menow he s got to run for me by thunder Ill bet on
him too

Jeff pushed his way through to Bud He was smiling with that crafty
look in his eyes which should have warned a child that the smile went no
deeper than his lips

Bud doggone it I like yore nerve Besides you owe me something for
the way you trimmed me last Sunday Ill just give you fifteen to one
and you put up Skeeter at seventyfive and as much money as yore a
mind to A pile of it come out of my pocket so

Well dont holler your head off Jeff Hows two hundred

Suits me kid He winked at the others who knew how sure a thing he
had to back his wager It ll be a lot of money if I should lose
He turned suddenly to Dave How much was that you put up agin the kid
Dave

One hundred dollars and a tentoone shot I win Dave drawled That
ought to satisfy yuh it aint a frameup The kids crazy thats all

Oh Am I Bud turned hotly Well Ive bet half of all the money
I have in the world And Im game for the other half He stopped
abruptly cast one look at Sunfish and another at Boise stepping about
uneasily his shiny coat rippling beautiful He turned and combed
Sunfishs scanty mane with his gloved fingers Those nearest saw that
his lips were trembling a little and mistook his hidden emotion for
anger

You got him going a man whispered in Jeffs ear The kids crazy mad
Hell bet the shirt off his back if yuh egg him on a little more

Jeff must have decided to egg Bud on By the time the crowd had
reached the course and the first more commonplace races were over
the other half of his money was in the hands of the stakeholder who
happened on this day to be Jerry And the odds varied from four to one
up to Jeff Halls scornful fifteen

Bet yuh five hundred dollars against your bay horse Lew offered when
Bud confessed that he had not another dollar to bet

All right its a go with me Bud answered recklessly Get his
hundred Jerry and put down Stopper

Whats that saddle worth another asked meaningly

One hundred dollars snapped Bud And if you want to go further
there are my chaps and spurs and this silvermounted bridleand my boots
and hatand Ill throw in Sunfish for whatever you say his hides worth
Who wants the outfit

Ill take em said Jeff and permitted Jerry and Dave to appraise the
outfit which Bud piled contemptuously in a heap

He mounted Sunfish bareback with a rope halter Bud was bareheaded and
in his sock feet His eyes were terribly blue and bright and his face
was flushed as a drunken mans He glanced over to the bank where
the women and children were watching It seemed to him that one woman
fluttered her handkerchief and his heart beat unevenly for a minute

Then he was riding at a walk down the course to the farthest post and
the crowd was laughing at the contrast between the two horses Boise
stepped springily tossing his head his eyes ablaze with ardor for the
race Beside him Sunfish walked steadily as if he were carrying a pack
He was not a pretty horse to look at His neck was long and thin his
mane and tail scanty and uneven a nondescript sorrel His head looked
large set on the end of that neck his nose was dished in and his eyes
had a certain veiled look as if he were hiding a bad disposition under
those droopy lids Without a saddle he betrayed his high thin withers
the sway in his back his high hip bones His front legs were flat with
long stringylooking muscles under his unkempt buckskin hide Even the
women laughed at Sunfish

Beside them two men rode the starter and another to see that the start
was fair So they receded down the flat yellow course and dwindled to
mere miniature figures against the sand so that one could not tell one
horse from another

The crowd bunched still laughing at how the singin kid was going to
feel when he rode again to meet them It would cure him of racing they
said It would be a good lesson serve him right for coming in there and
thinking because he had cleaned up once or twice that he could not be
beaten

Here they come Jeff Hall announced satisfiedly and spat into the
sand as a tiny blue puff of smoke showed beside one of the dots and two
other dots began to grow perceptibly larger within a yellow cloud which
rolled along the earth

Men reined this way and that or stood on their toes if they were afoot
the better to see the two rolling dots In a moment one dot seemed
larger than the other One could glimpse the upflinging of knees as two
horses leaped closer and closer

Welllhes keepin Dave in sightthats more than what I expected
hed do Jeff observed

It was Pop who suddenly gave a whoop that cracked and shrilled into
falsetto

Shucks amighty Dave hes awhippin up to keep the KID in sight he
quavered ShucksaMIGHTY he s acomin

He was Lying forward flattened along Sunfishs hardmuscled shoulders
Bud was gaining and gainingone length then two lengths as he shot
under the wire slowed and rode back to find a silent crowd watching
him

He was clothed safely again in chaps boots spurs hatexcept that I
have named the articles backward cowpuncher that he was Bud put on his
hat before he even reached for his bootsand was collecting his wagers
relentlessly as Shylock ever took his toll before he paid any attention
to the atmosphere around him Then because someone shouted a question
three inches from his ear Bud turned and laughed as he faced them

Why sure hes from running stock I never said he wasntbecause none
of you makebelieve horsemen had sense enough to see the speed in him
and get curious You bushracers never saw a real racehorse before I
guess They arent always pretty to look at you know Sunfish has
all the earmarks of speed if you know how to look for them Hes
thoroughbred sired by Trump out of Kansas Chippyif that means
anything to you fellows He looked them over eyes meeting eyes until
his glance rested on Jeff Hall Ive got his registration papers in my
grip if you arent convinced And he added by way of rubbing it in
I guess Ive got about all the money there is in this valley

No you aint Pop Truman cackled teetering backward and forward
while he counted his winnings I bet on ye young feller Brought me in
something too It did so



CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHILE THE GOINGS GOOD

At supper Bud noticed that Marian standing at his right side set down
his cup of coffee with her right hand and at the same instant he felt
her left hand fumble in his pocket and then touch his elbow She went
on and Bud in his haste to get outside drank his coffee so hot that it
scalded his mouth Jerry rose up and stepped backward over the bench as
Bud passed him and went out at his heels

Go play the piano for half an hour and then meet me where you got them
mushrooms And when you quit playing duck quick Tell Honey youll be
back in a minute Have her hunt for music for yuh while youre outor
something like that Dont let on

Bud might have questioned Jerry but that cautious young man was already
turning back to call somethingto Dave so Bud went around the corner
glancing into the pantry window as he passed Marian was not in sight
nor was Honey at the moment when he stood beside the step of the
postoffice

Boldness carries its own talisman against danger Bud went inwithout
slamming the door behind him you may be sureand drew his small
notebook from his inside pocket With that to consult frequently he sat
down by the window where the failing light was strongest and proceeded
to jot down imaginary figures on the paper he pulled from his coat
pocket and unfolded as if it were of no value whatever to him The piano
playing ordered by Jerry could wait

What Marian had to say on this occasion could not be written upon a
cigarette paper In effect her note was a preface to Jerrys commands
Bud saw where she had written words and erased them so thoroughly that
the cheap paper was almost worn through She had been afraid poor lady
but her fear could not prevent the writing

You must leave tonight for Crater and cash the checks given you to pay
the bets Go to Crater If you dont know the way keep due north after
you have crossed Gold Gap Theres the stage road but theyll watch
that Im afraid They mean to stop payment on the checks But
first they will kill you if they can They say you cheated with that
thoroughbred horse They took their losses so calmlyI knew that they
meant to rob you To show you how I know it was Lew you shot on the
ridge that night His rheumatism was caused by your bullet that nicked
his shoulder So you see what sort we arego Dont waitgo now

Bud looked up and there was Honey leaning over the counter smiling at
him

Well how much is it she teased when she saw he had discovered her

Bud drew a line across the note and added imaginary columns of figures
his hatbrim hiding his face

Over eleven thousand dollars he announced and twisted the paper
in his fingers while he went over to her Almost enough to start
housekeeping

Honey blushed and leaned to look for something which she pretended to
have dropped and Bud seized the opportunity to tuck the paper out of
sight I feel pretty much intoxicated tonight Honey he said I
think I need soothing or somethingand you know what music does to the
savage breast Let s play

All right Youve been staying away lately till I thought you were
mad Honey assented rather eagerly and opened the little gate in the
half partition just as Bud was vaulting the counter which gave her
a great laugh and a chance for playful scuffling Bud kissed her and
immediately regretted the caress

Jerry had told him to play the piano but Bud took his mandolin and
played that while Honey thumped out chords for him As he had half
expected most of the men strayed in and perched here and there
listening just as if there had not been a most unusual horserace to
discuss before they slept Indeed Bud had never seen the Little Lost
boys so thoughtful and this silence struck him all at once as something
sinister like a beast of prey stalking its kill

Two waltzes he playedand then in the middle of a favorite twostep
a mandolin string snapped with a sharp twang and Bud came as close to
swearing as a wellbehaved young man may come in the presence of a lady

Now Ill have to go get a new E string he complained You play the
Danube for the boysthe way I taught youwhile I get this fixed Ive
an extra string down in the bunkhouse it wont take five minutes to
get it He laid the mandolin down on his chair bolted out through the
screen door which he slammed after him to let Jerry know that he was
coming and walked halfway to the bunkhouse before he veered off around
the corner of the machine shed and ran

Jerry was waiting by the old shed and without a word he led Bud behind
it where Sunfish was standing saddled and bridled

You got to go Bud while the goings good Id go with yuh if I
dared Jerry mumbled guardedly You hit for Crater Bud and put that
money in the bank You can cut into the stage road where it crosses
Oldman Creek if you go straight up the race track to the far end and
follow the trail from there You cant miss itthere aint but one way
to go I got yuh this horse because hes worth moren what the other two
are and hes faster And Bud if anybody rides up on yuh shoot Dont
monkey around about it And you RIDE

All right Bud muttered But Ill have to go down in the pasture
and get my money first Ive got my own private bank down there and I
havent enough in my pockets to play penny ante more than one round

Hell Jerrys hand lifted to Buds shoulder and gripped it for a
minute Thats right on the road to the Sinks man He stood biting
his lips thinking deeply turning his head now and then as little
sounds came from the house the waltz Honey was playing the postoffice
door slamming shut

You tell me where that moneys cached Bud and Ill go after it I
guess youll have to trust meI sure wouldnt let yuh go down to the
pasture yourself right now Where is it

Look under that flat rock right by the gate post where the top bars
hit the ground Its wrapped up in a handkerchief so just bring
the package Its been easy to tuck things under the rock when I was
putting up the bars Ill wait here

Good enoughId sure have felt easier if Id known you wasnt carrying
all that money Whereupon Jerry disappeared and his going made no
sound

Bud stood beside Sunfish wondering if he had been a fool to trust
Jerry By his own admission Jerry was living without the law and this
might easily be a smooth scheme of robbery He turned and strained his
eyes into the dusk listening trying to hear some sound that would
show which way Jerry had gone He was on the point of following
himsuspicion getting the better of his faithwhen Sunfish moved his
head abruptly to one side bumping Buds head with his cheek At the
same instant a hand touched Buds arm

I saw you from the kitchen window Marian whispered tensely I was
afraid you hadnt read my note or perhaps wouldnt pay any attention to
it I heard you and Jerryof course he wont dare go with you and show
you the shortcut even if he knows it Theres a quicker way than
up the creekbed I have Boise out in the bushes and a saddle I was
afraid to wait at the barn long enough to saddle him You gohes
behind that great pile of rocks back of the corrals Ill wait for
Jerry She gave him a push and Bud was so astonished that he made no
reply whatever but did exactly as she had told him to do

Boise was standing behind the peaked outcropping of rock and beside
him was a stocksaddle which must have taxed Marians strength to carry
Indeed Bud thought she must have had wings to do so much in so short a
space of time though when he came to estimate that time he decided that
he must have been away from the house ten minutes at least If Marian
followed him closely enough to see him duck behind the machine shed and
meet Jerry she could run behind the corral and get Boise out by way of
the back door of the stable There was a path screened from the corral
by a fringe of brush which went that way The truth flashed upon him
that one could ride unseen all around Little Lost

He was just dropping the stirrup down from the saddle horn when Marian
appeared with Jerry and Sunfish close behind her Jerry held out the
package

She says shell show you a short cut he whispered She says I dont
know anything about it I guess shes righttheres a lot I dont know
Lew s gone and she says shell be back before daylight If they miss
Boise theyll think you stole him But they wont look Dave wouldnt
slam around in the night on Boisehe thinks too much of him Wellbeat
it and I sure wish yuh luck You be careful Marian Come back this
way and if you see a mans handkerchief hanging on this bush right here
where Im standing itll mean youve been missed

Thank you Jerry Marian whispered Ill look for it Come Budkeep
close behind me and dont make any noise

Bud would have protested but Marian did not give him a chance She
took up the reins grasped the saddle horn stuck her slipper toe in
the stirrup and mounted Boise as quickly as Bud could have done itas
easily too making allowance for the difference in their height Bud
mounted Sunfish and followed her down the trail which led to the race
track but when they had gone through the brush and could see starlight
beyond she turned sharply to the left let Boise pick his way carefully
over a rocky stretch and plunged into the brush again leaning low in
the saddle so that the higher branches would not claw at her hair and
face

When they had once more come into open ground with a shoulder of Catrock
Peak before them Marian pulled up long enough to untie her apron and
bind it over her hair like a peasant woman She glanced back at Bud
and although darkness hid the expression on her face he saw her eyes
shining in the starlight She raised her hand and beckoned and Bud
reined Sunfish close alongside

Were going into a spooky place now she leaned toward him to whisper
Boise knows the way and your horse will follow

All right Bud whispered back But youd better tell me the way and
let me go on alone Im pretty good at scouting out new trails I dont
want you to get in trouble

She would not listen to more of that but pushed him back with the flat
of her bare hand and rode ahead of him again Straight at the sheer
bluff that lifted its huge rocky shape before them she led the way
So far as Bud could see she was not following any trail but was aiming
at a certain point and was sure enough of the ground to avoid detours

They came out upon the bank of the dry riverbed Bud knew it by the
flatness of the foreground and the general contour of the mountains
beyond But immediately they turned at a sharp angle travelled for a
few minutes with the riverbed at their backs and entered a narrow slit
in the mountains where two peaks had been rent asunder in some titanic
upheaval when the world was young The horses scrambled along the rocky
bottom for a little way then Boise disappeared

Sunfish halted threw his head this way and that gave a suspicious
sniff and turned carefully around the corner of a squarefaced boulder
In front was blackness Bud urged him a little with rein and soft
pressure of the spurs and Sunfish stepped forward He seemed reassured
to find firm smooth sand under his feet and hurried a little until
Boise was just ahead clicking his feet now and then against a rock

Coming Marians voice sounded subdued muffled by the close walls of
the tunnellike crevice

Coming Bud assured her quietly At your heels

I always used to feel spooky when I was riding through here Marian
said dropping back so that they rode side by side stirrups touching
I was ten when I first made the trip It was to get away from Indians
They wouldnt come into these places Eddie and I found the way through
We were afraid they were after us and so we kept going and our horses
brought us out Eddieis my brother

You grew up here Bud did not know how much incredulity was in his
voice I was raised amongst the Indians in Wyoming I thought you were
from the East

I was in Chicago for three years Marian explained I studied every
waking minute I think I wanted to be a singer ThenI came home to
help bury mother FatherLew and father were partners and Imarried
Lew I didnt knowit seemed as though I must Father put it that way
The old story Bud I used to laugh at it in novels but it does happen
Lew had a hold over father and Eddie and he wanted me I married him
but it did no good for father was killed just a little more than a
month afterwards We had a ranch up here in the Redwater Valley about
halfway to Crater But it wentLew gambled and drank andso he took me
to Little Lost Ive been there for two years

The words of pityand morethat crowded forward for utterance Bud
knew he must not speak So he said nothing at all

Lew has always held Eddie over my head she went on pouring out her
troubles to him Theres a gang called the Catrock Gang and Lew is
one of them I told you Lew is the man you shot I think Dave Truman
is in with themat any rate he shuts his eyes to whatever goes on
and gets part of the stealings I feel sure Thats why Lew is such a
favorite You see Eddie is oneIm trusting you with my life almost
when I tell you this

But I couldnt stand by and not lift a hand to save you I knew they
would kill you Theyd have to because I felt that you would fight and
never give up And you are too fine a man for those beasts to murder for
the money you have I knew the minute I saw Jeff paying you his losings
with a check and some of the others doing the same just what would
happen Jeff is almost as bad as the Catrockers except that he is too
cowardly to come out into the open He gave you a check and everyone
who was there knew he would hurry up to Crater and stop payment on it
if he could do it and keep out of your sight Those cronies of his would
do the sameso they paid with checks

And the Catrock gang knew that They mean to get hold of you rob
andandkill you and forge the endorsement on the checks and let one
man cash them in Crater before payment can be stopped Indeed the gang
will see to it that Jeff stays away from Crater Lew hinted that while
they were about it they might as well clean out the bank It wouldnt be
the first time she added bitterly

She stopped then and asked for a match and when Bud gave her one she
lighted a candle and held it up so that she could examine the walls
Its a natural tunnel she volunteered in a different tone Somewhere
along here there is a branch that goes back into the hill and ends in a
blowhole But were all right so far

She blew out the candle and urged Boise forward edging over to the
right

Wasnt that taking quite a chance making a light Bud asked as they
went on

It was but not so great a chance as missing the way Jerry didnt hear
anything of them when he went to the pasture gate and they may not come
through this way at all They may not realize at first that you have
left and even when they did they would not believe at first that you
had gone to Crater You seeand in the darkness Bud could picture her
troubled smilethey think you are an awful fool in some ways The
way you bet today was pure madness

It would have been except that I knew I could win

They never bet like that They always figure as they call it that
the other fellow is going to play some trick on them Half the time Jeff
bets against his own horse on the sly They all do unless they feel
sure that their own trick is best

They should have done that today Bud observed dryly But youve
explained it They thought Im an awful fool

Out of the darkness came Marians voice Its because youre so
different They cant understand you

Bud was not interested in his own foolishness just then Something in
her voice had thrilled him anew with a desire to help her and with the
conviction that he was desperately in need of help There was a pathetic
patience in her tone when she summarized he whole affair in those last
two sentences It was as if she were telling him how her whole life
was darkened because she herself was differentbecause they could not
understand a woman so fine so true and sweet

What will happen if you are missed If you go back and discover Jerrys
handkerchief on that bush what will you do You cant go back if they
find out There was no need for him to finish that sentence

I dont know said Marian what I shall do I hadnt thought much
about it

I havent thought much about anything else Bud told her
straightforwardly If Jerry flags you you d better keep going
Couldnt you go to friends

I couldif I had any Bud you dont understand Eddie is the only
relative I have on earth that I know at all He ishes with the
Catrockers and Lew dominates him completely Lew has pushed Ed into
doing things so that I must shield both or neither And Eddies just a
boy So Ive no one at all

Bud studied this while they rode on through the defile that was more
frequently a tunnel since the succession of caves always had an outlet
which Marian found She had stopped now and dismounted and they were
leading their horses down a steep scrambling place with the stars
showing overhead

A blowhole Marian informed him briefly Well come into another
cave soon and while its safe if you know it Ill explain now that
you must walk ahead of your horse and keep your right hand always in
touch with the wall until we see the stars again Theres a ledgefive
feet wide in the narrowest place if you are nervous about ledgesand
if you should get off that youd have a drop of ten feet or so We found
that the ledge makes easier travelling because the bottom is full of
rocks and nasty depressions that are noticeable only with lights

She started off again and Bud followed her his gloved fingers touching
the right wall his soul humbled before the greatness of this little
woman with the deep troubled eyes When they came out into the
starlight she stopped and listened for what seemed to Bud a very long
time

If they are coming they are a long way behind us she said
relievedly and remounted Boise knows his trail and has made
good time And your horse has proven beyond all doubt that hes a
thoroughbred Ive seen horses balk at going where we have gone

And Ive seen men who counted themselves brave as any who wouldnt do
what you are doing tonight Jerry for instance I wish youd go back
I cant bear having you take this risk

I cant go back Bud Not if they find Ive gone Then he heard her
laugh quietly I cant imagine now why I stayed and endured it all this
while I think I only needed the psychological moment for rebellion and
tonight the moment came So you see you have really done me a service
by getting into this scrape Its the first time I have been off the
ranch in a year

If you call that doing you a service Im going to ask you to let me
do something also for you Bud half smiled to himself in the darkness
thinking how diplomatic he was If youre found out youll have to
keep on going and I take it you wouldnt be particular where you went
So I wish you d take charge of part of this money for me and if you
leave go down to my mother on the Tomahawk ranch out from Laramie
Anyone can tell you where it is when you get down that way If you need
any money use it And tell mother I sent her the finest cook in the
country Mother by the way is a great musician Marian She taught
me all I know of music Youd get along just fine with mother And she
needs you honest She isnt very strong yet she cant find anyone to
suit down there

I might not suit either said Marian her voice somewhat muffled

Oh Im not afraid of that Andtheres a message I want to sendI
promised mother Id

Oh hush Youre really an awfully poor prevaricator Bud This is to
help me youre planning

Wellits to help me that I want you to take part of the money The
gang wont hold you up will they And I want mother to have it I want
her to have you tooto help out when company comes drifting in there
sometimes fifteen or twenty strong Especially on Sunday Mother has to
wait on them and cook for them andas long as you are going to cook
for a bunch you may as well do it where it will be appreciated and
where youll be treated like alike a lady ought to be treated

Youre even worse began Marian laughing softly and stopped
abruptly listening her head turned behind them Shshsomeone is
coming behind us she whispered Were almost throughcome on and
dont talk



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN GUARDIAN ANGELS ARE RIDING POINT

They plunged into darkness again rode at a half trot over smooth hard
sand Bud trusting himself wholly to Marian and to the sagacity of the
two horses who could see he hoped much better than he himself could
His keen hearing had caught a faint sound from behind themfar back in
the crevicelike gorge they had just quitted he believed For Marians
sake he stared anxiously ahead eager for the first faint suggestion of
starlight before them It came and he breathed freer and felt of his
gun in its holster pulling it forward an inch or two

This way Bud Marian murmured and swung Boise to the left against
the mountain under and through which they seemed to have passed She led
him into another small gorge whose extent he could not see and stopped
him with a hand pressed against Sunfishs shoulder

Wed better get down and hold our horses quiet she cautioned Boise
may try to whinny and he mustnt

They stood side by side at their horses heads holding the animals
close For a time there were no sounds at all save the breathing of the
horses and once a repressed sigh from Marian Bud remembered suddenly
how tired she must be At six oclock that morning she had fed twelve
men a substantial breakfast At noon there had been dinner for several
more than twelve and supper again at sixand here she was risking
her life when she should be in bed He felt for her free hand found it
hanging listlessly by her side and took it in his own and held it there
just as one holds the hand of a timid child Yet Marian was not timid

A subdued mutter of voices the click of hoofs striking against stone
and the pursuers passed within thirty feet of them Boise had lifted
his head to nicker a salute but Marians jerk on the reins stopped him
They stood very still not daring so much as a whisper until the sounds
had receded and silence came again

They took the sidehill trail whispered Marian pushing Boise
backward to turn him in the narrow defile Youll have to get down
the hill into the creekbed and follow that until you come to the stage
road There may be others coming that way but they will be two or three
miles behind you This tunnel trail cuts off at least five miles but we
had to go slower you see

Right here you can lead Sunfish down the bluff to the creek Its all
dry and around the first bend you will see where the road crosses Turn
to the left on that and ride This horse of yours will have to show the
stuff thats in him Get to Crater ahead of these men that took the hill
trail Theyll not ride fastthey never dreamed you had come through
here but they came to cut off the distance and to head you off With
others behind you must beat them all in or youll be trapped between

She had left Boise tied hastily to a bush and was walking ahead of Bud
down the steep rocky hillside to show him the easiest way amongst the
boulders Halfway down Bud caught her shoulder and stopped her

Im not a kid he said firmly I can make it from here alone Not
another step young lady If you can get back home Youll be doing
enough Take thisits money but I dont know how much And watch your
chance and go down to mother with that message Birnie of the Tomahawk
outfityoull find out in Laramie where to go And tell mother Im all
right and shell see me some daywhen Ive made my stake God bless
you little woman Youre the truest sweetest little woman in the
world Theres just one more like youthats mother Now go backand
for Gods sake he careful

He pressed money into her two hands held them tightly together kissed
them both hurriedly and plunged down the hill with Sunfish slipping and
sliding after him For her safety if not for his own he meant to get
away from there as quickly as possible

In the creek bed he mounted and rode away at a sharp gallop glad that
Sunfish thoroughbred though he was had not been raised tenderly in
stall and corral but had run free with the range horses and had learned
to keep his feet under him in rough country or smooth When he reached
the crossing of the stage road he turned to the left as Marian had
commanded and put Sunfish to a pace that slid the miles behind him

With his thoughts clinging to Marian to the harshness which life had
shown her who was all goodness and sweetness and courage Bud forgot to
keep careful watch behind him or to look for the place where the hill
trail joined the road as it probably did some distance from Crater
It would be a blind trail of coursesince only the Catrock gang and
Marian knew of it

They came into the road not far behind him out of rockstrewn brushy
wilderness that sloped up steeply to the rugged sides of Gold Gap
mountains Sunfish discovered them first and gave Bud warning just
before they identified him and began to shoot

Bud laid himself along the shoulder of his horse with a handful of mane
to steady him while he watched his chance and fired back at them There
were four just the number he had guessed from the sounds as they came
out of the tunnel A horse ran staggering toward him with the others
faltered and fell Bud was sorry for that It had been no part of his
plan to shoot down the horses

The three came on leaving the fourth to his own devicesand that too
was quite in keeping with the type of human vultures they were They
kept firing at Bud and once he felt Sunfish wince and leap forward as
if a spur had raked him Bud shot again and thought he saw one horseman
lurch backward But he could not be surethey were going at a terrific
pace now and Sunfish was leaving them farther and farther behind They
were outclassed hopelessly out of pistol range and they must have
known it for although they held to the chase they fired no more shots

Then a dog barked and Bud knew that he was passing a ranch He could
smell the fresh hay in the stacks and a moment later he descried the
black hulk of ranch buildings Sunfish was running easily his breath
unlabored Bud stood in the stirrups and looked back They were still
coming for he could hear the pound of hoofs

The ranch was behind him Clear starlight was all around and the bulk
of near mountains The road seemed sandy yielding beneath the pound
of Sunfishs hoofs Bud leaned forward again in the saddle and planned
what he would do when he reached Crater found time also to hope that
Marian had gone back and had not heard the shooting

Another dog barked this time on the right Bud saw that they were
passing a picket fence The barking of this dog started another farther
ahead and to the left Houses so close together could only mean that
he was approaching Crater Bud began to pull Sunfish down to a more
conventional pace He did not particularly want to see heads thrust
from windows and questions shouted to him The Catrock gang might have
friends up this way It would be strange Bud thought if they hadnt

He loped along the road grown broader now and smoother Many houses he
passed and the mouths of obscure lanes Dogs ran out at him Bud slowed
to a walk and turned in the saddle listening Away back where he had
first met the signs of civilization the dog he had aroused was barking
again his deep baying blurred by the distance Bud grinned to himself
and rode on at a walk speaking now and then to an inquiring dog and
calling him Purp in a tone that soothed

Crater he discovered in a cursory patrol of the place was no more than
an overgrown village The courthouse and jail stood on the main street
and just beyond was the bank Bud rode here and there examining closely
the fronts of various buildings before he concluded that there was only
the one bank in Crater When he was quite sure of that he chose place
near by the rear of the bank where one horse and a cow occupied a
comfortable corral together with hay He unsaddled Sunfish and turned
him there himself returning to the bank before those other nightriders
had more than reached the first straggling suburbs of the town

On the porch of the courthouse behind a jutting corner pillar that
seemed especially designed for the concealment of a man in Buds
situation he rolled cigarette which he meant to smoke later on when the
way was clear and waited for the horsemen to appear

Presently they came rode to a point opposite the courthouse and bank
with no more than a careless glance that way and halted in front of an
uninviting hotel across the street Two remained on their horses while
the third pounded on the door and shook it by the knob and finally
raised the landlord from his sleep There was a conference which Bud
witnessed with much interest A lamp had been lighted in the bare
office and against the yellow glow Bud distinctly saw the landlord nod
his head twicewhich plainly betokened some sort of understanding

He was glad that he had not stopped at the hotel He felt much more
comfortable on the courthouse porch Mothers guardian angels must be
riding point tonight he mused

The horsemen rode back to a livery stable which Bud had observed but had
not entered There they also sought for news of him it would appear
You will recall however that Bud had ridden slowly into the business
district of Crater and his passing had been unmarked except by the
barking of dogs that spent their nights in yammering at every sound
and so were never taken seriously The three horsemen were plainly
nonplussed and conferred together in low tones before they rode on It
was evident that they meant to find Bud if they could What they meant
to do with him Bud did not attempt to conjecture He did not intend to
be found

After a while the horsemen rode back to the hotel got the landlord out
with less difficulty than before and had another talk with him

He stole a horse from Dave Truman Bud heard one of the three say
distinctly That there running horse Dave had

The landlord tucked in his shirt and exclaimed at the news and Bud
heard him mention the sheriff But nothing came of that evidently They
talked further and reined their horses to ride back whence they came

He likelys give us the slip outside of town some place one man
concluded Well ride back and see If he shows up hell likely want
to eat And send Dick out to the Stivers place Well come arunning
He had lowered his voice so that Bud could not hear what was to happen
before the landlord sent Dick but he decided he would not pry into the
matter and try to fill that gap in the conversation

He sat where he was until the three had ridden back down the sandy road
which served as a street Then he slipped behind the courthouse and
smoked his cigarette and went and borrowed hay from the cow and the
horse in the corral and made himself some sort of bed with his saddle
blanket to help out and slept until morning



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE CATROCK GANG

A woman with a checkered apron and a motherly look came to let her
chickens out and milk the cow and woke Bud so that she could tell him
she believed he had been on a toot or he never would have taken such
a liberty with her corral Bud agreed to the toot and apologized and
asked for breakfast And the woman after one good look at him handed
him the milk bucket and asked him how he liked his eggs

All the way from barn to breakfast Bud grinned and the woman
chuckled and called him Smarty and told him to come in as soon as the
cow was milked

Bud had a great breakfast with the widow Hanson She talked and Bud
learned a good deal about Crater and its surroundings and when he spoke
of holdup gangs she seemed to know immediately what he meant and
told him a great deal more about the Catrockers than Marian had done
Everything from murdering and robbing a peddler to looting the banks at
Crater and Lava was laid to the Catrockers They were the human buzzards
that watched over the country and swooped down wherever there was money
The sheriff couldnt do anything with them and no one expected him to
so far as Bud could discover

He hesitated a long time before he asked about Marian Morris Mrs
Hanson wept while she related Marians history which in substance was
exactly what Marian herself had told Bud Mrs Hanson however told how
Marian had fought to save her father and Ed and how she had married Lew
Morris as a part of her campaign for honesty and goodness Now she was
down at Little Lost cooking for a gang of men said Mrs Hanson when
she ought to be out in the world singing for thousands and her in silks
and diamonds instead of gingham dresses and not enough of them

Marian Collier is the sweetest thing that ever grew up in this
country the old lady sniffled Shes one in a thousand and when she
was off to school she showed that she wasnt no common trash She wanted
to be an opery singer but then her mother died and Marian done what
looked to be her duty A bird in a trap is what I call her

Bud regretted having opened the subject and praised the cooking by way
of turning his hostesss thoughts into a different channel He asked
her if she would accept him as a boarder while he was in town and was
promptly accepted

He did not want to appear in public until the bank was opened and
he was a bit troubled over identification There could be no harm he
reflected in confiding to Mrs Hanson as much as was necessary of
his adventures Wherefore he dried the dishes for her and told her his
errand in town and why it was that he and his horse had slept in her
corral instead of patronizing hotel and livery stable He showed her the
checks he wanted to cash and asked her with flattering eagerness for
her advice what he should do He had been warned he said that Jeff
and his friends might try to beat him yet by stopping payment and he
knew that he had been followed by them to town

What Youll do will be what I tell ye Mrs Hanson replied with
decision The cashier is a friend to meI was with his wife last month
with her first baby and they swear by me now for I gave her good care
Well go over there this minute and have talk with him Hell do what
he can for ye and hell do it for my sake

You dont know me remember Bud reminded her honestly

The widow Hanson gave him a scornful smile and toss of her head And
do I not she demanded Do you think Ive buried three husbands and
thinking now of the fourth without knowing whats wrote a mans face
Three I buried and only one died his bed I can tell if a mans honest
or not without giving him the second look If youve got them checks
you should get the money on themfor I know their stripe Come on with
me to Jimmy Lawtons house Hes likely holding the baby while Minie
does the dishes

Mrs Hanson guessed shrewdly The cashier of the Crater County Bank was
doing exactly what she said he would be doing He was sitting in the
kitchen rocking a pink baby wrapped in white outing flannel with blue
border when Mrs Hanson without the formality of more than one warning
tap on the screen door walked in with Bud She held out her hands for
the baby while she introduced the cashier to Bud In the next breath she
was explaining what was wanted of the bank

Theyve done it before and ye know its plain thievery and ought to be
complained about So now get your wits to work Jimmy for this friend
of mine is entitled to his money and should have it if it is there to be
had

Oh its there said Jimmy He looked at his watch looked at the
kitchen clock looked at Bud and winked We open at nine in this
town he said It lacks half an hourbut let me see those checks

Very relievedly Bud produced them watched the cashier scan each one to
make sure that they were right and quaked when Jimmy scowled at Jeff
Halls signature on the largest check of all He had a notion to use
the wrong signature but he may have lost his nerve Its all right Mr
Birnie Just endorse these and Ill take them into the bank and attend
to them the first thing I do after the door is open Youd better come
in when I open up

The gang had some talk about cleaning out the bank while they re about
it Bud remembered suddenly Cant you appoint me something or hire
me as a guard and let me help out How many men do you have here in this
bank

Two except when the presidents in his office in the rear Thats fine
of you to offer Weve been held up onceand they cleaned us out of
cash Jimmy turned to Mrs Hanson Mother cant you run over and
have Jess come and swear Mr Birnie in as a deputy If I go or he goes
someone may notice it and tip the gang off

Mrs Hanson hastily deposited the baby in its cradle and went to call
Jess her face pink with excitement

Youre lucky you stopped at her house instead of some other place
Jimmy observed Shes a corking good woman As a deputy sheriff youll
come in mighty handy if they do try anything Mr Birnieif youre the
kind of a man you look to be Ill bet you can shoot Can you

If you scare me badly enough I might get a cramp in my trigger
finger Bud confessed Jimmy grinned and went back to considering his
own part

Ill cash these checks for you the first thing I do And as deputy you
can go with me Ill have to unlock the door on time and if they mean
to stop payment and clean the bank too it will probably be done all
at once It has been a year since they bothered us so they may need a
little change If Jess isnt busy he may stick around

No one expects him to round up the gang I heard

No one expects him to go into Catrock Canyon after them Hell round
them up quick enough if he can catch them far enough from their
holes

Jess returned with Mrs Hanson swore in a new deputy eyed Bud
curiously and agreed to remain hidden across the road from the bank
with a rifle He nodded understandingly when Bud warned him that the
looting was a matter of hearsay on his part and departed with an
awkward compliment to Mrs Jim about hoping that the baby was going to
look like her

Jim lived just behind the bank and a high board fence between the two
buildings served to hide his coming and going But Bud took off his hat
and walked stoopingby special request of Mrs Hansonto make sure
that he was not observed

I think Ill stand out in front of the window said Bud when they were
inside It will look more natural and if any of these fellows show up
Id just as soon not show my brand the first thing

They showed up all right within two minutes of the unlocking of the
bank and the rolling up of the shades Jeff Hall was the first man
to walk in and he stopped short when he saw Bud lounging before the
tellers window and the cashier busy within Other men were straggling
up on the porch and two of them entered Jeff walked over to Bud who
shifted his position enough to bring him facing Jeff whom he did not
trust at all

Mr Lawton Jeff began hurriedly I want to stop payment on a check
this young feller got from me by fraud Its for five thousand eight
hundred dollars and I notify you

Too late Mr Hall I have already accepted the checks Where did the
fraud come in You can bring suit of course to recover

Ill tell you Jimmy He bet that my horse couldnt beat Dave Trumans
Boise A good many bet on the same thing But my horse proved to have
more speed so a lot of them are sore Bud chuckled as other Sunday
losers came straggling in

Well its too late I have honored the checks Jimmy said crisply
and turned to hand a sealed manila envelope to the bookkeeper with
whispered instructions The bookkeeper who had just entered from the
rear of the office turned on his heel and left again

Jeff muttered something to his friends and went outside as if their
business were done for the day

I gave you five thousand in currency and the balance in a cashiers
check Jimmy whispered through he wicket Sent it to the house We
dont keep a great dealten thousands our limit in cash and I dont
think you want to pack gold or silver

No I didnt Id rather

Two men came in one going over to the desk where he apparently wrote
a check the other came straight to the window Bud looked into the
heavily bearded face of a man who had the eyes of Lew Morris He shifted
his position a little so that he faced the mans right side The one at
the desk was glancing slyly over his shoulder at the bookkeeper who had
just returned to his work

Can you change this twenty so I can get seven dollars and a quarter
out of it asked the man at he window As he slid the bill through the
wicket he started to sneeze and reached backwardfor his handkerchief
apparently

Heres one said Bud Dont sneeze too hard oldtimer or youre
liable to sneeze your whiskers all off Its happened before

Someone outside fired a shot in at Bud clipping his hatband in front
At the sound of the shot the whiskered one snatched his gun out and the
cashier shot him Bud had sent a shot through the outside window and hit
somebodywhom he did not know for he had no time to look The young
fellow at the desk had whirled and was pointing a gun shakily first
at he cashier and then at Bud Bud fired and knocked he gun out of his
hand then stepped over the man he suspected was Lew and caught the
young fellow by the wrist

Youre Ed Collierby your eyes and your mouth Bud said in a rapid
undertone Im going to get you out of this if youll do what I say
Will you

He got me in here honest the young fellow quaked He couldnt be
more than nineteen Bud guessed swiftly

Let me through Jimmy Bud ordered hurriedly You got the man that
put up this job Ill take the kid out the back way if you dont mind

Jimmy opened the steelgrilled door and let them through

Ed Collier he said in a tone of recognition I heard he was
trailing

Forget it Jimmy If the sheriff asks about him say he got out Now
Ed Im going to take you over to Mrs Hansons Shell keep an eye on
you for a while

Eddie was looking at the dead man on the floor and trembling so that he
did not attempt to reply and by way of Jimmys back fence and the widow
Hansons barn and corral Bud got Eddie safe into the kitchen just as
that determined lady was leaving home with a shotgun to help defend the
honor of the town

Bud took her by the shoulder and told her what he wanted her to do
Hes Marians brother and too young to be with that gang So keep him
here safe and out of sight until I come Then Ill want to borrow your
horse Shall I tie the kid

And me an ablebodied woman that could turn him acrost my knee Mrs
Hansons eyes snapped

Its more likely the boy needs his breakfast Get along with ye

Bud got along slipping into the bank by the rear door and taking a hand
in the desultory firing in the street The sheriff had a couple of men
ironed and one man down and the landlord of the hotel was doing a great
deal of explaining that he had never seen the bandits before Just by
way of stimulating his memory Bud threw a bullet close to his heels
and the landlord thereupon grovelled and wept while he protested his
innocence

Hes a damn liar sheriff Bud called across the hoofscarred road
He was talking to them about eleven oclock last night There were
three that chased me into town and they got him up out of bed to find
out whether Id stopped there I hadnt luckily for me If I had hed
have showed them the way to my room and hed have had a dead boarder
this morning Keep right on shedding tears you old cutthroat I was
sitting on the courthouse porch last night and I heard every word
that passed between you and the Catrockers

Ive been suspicioning here was where they got their information
right along the sheriff commented and slipped the handcuffs on
the landlord Investigation proved that Jeff Hall and his friends had
suddenly decided that they had no business with the bank that day and
had mounted and galloped out of town when the first shot was fired
Which simplified matters a bit for Bud

In Jimmy Lawtons kitchen he received his money and when the prisoners
were locked up he saved himself some trouble with the sheriff by
hunting him up and explaining just why he had taken the Collier boy into
custody

You know yourself hes just a kid and if you send him over the road
hes a criminal for life I believe I can make a decent man of him I
want to try anyway So you just leave me this deputys badge and make
my commission regular and permanent and Ill keep an eye on him Give
me a paper so I can get a requisition and bring him back to stand trial
any time he breaks out Ill be responsible for him sheriff

And who in blazes are you the sheriff inquired with a grin to remove
the sting of suspicion Name sounded familiar too

Bud Birnie of the Tomahawk down near Laramie Telegraph Laramie if you
like and find out about me

Good Lord I know the Tomahawk like a book cried the sheriff And
youre Bob Birnies boy Say Dyou remember dragging into camp on the
summit one time when you was about twelve years oldbeen hidin out
from Injuns about three days Well say Im the feller that packed you
into the tent and fed yuh when yuh come to Remember the time I rode
down and stayed over night at yore place the time Bill Nye come down
from his prospect hole up in the Snowies bringin word the Injuns was
up again The sheriff grabbed Buds hand and held it shaking it up and
down now and then to emphasize his words

Folks called you Buddy then I remember yuh helpin your mother cook
n wash dishes for us fellers I kinda felt like I had a claim on yuh
Buddy

Say Bill Nye hes famous now Writin books full of jokes and all
that He always was a comical cuss Dont you remember how the bunch
of us laughed at him when he drifted in about dark him and four
burrosthat one he called Boomerang that he named his paper after in
Laramie Ive told lots of times what he said when he come stoopin into
the kitchenhow Colorou had sent him word that hed give Bill just
four sleeps to get outa there An Hell says Bill I didnt need
any sleeps An we all turned to and cooked a hull beef yore dad had
butchered that dayand Bill loaded up with the first chunks we had
ready and pulled his freight He sure didnt need any sleeps

Yes you bet I remember Jesse Cummings is your name I sure ought
to remember you for you and your partner saved my life I expect I
thought Id seen you before when you made me deputy How about the kid
Can I have him Lew Morris the man that kept him on the wrong side of
the law is dead I heard the doctor say Jimmy got him when he pulled
his gun

Why yesif the town dont git onto me turnin him loose I guess you
can have the kid for all I care He didnt take any part in the holdup
did he Buddy

He was over by the customers desk when Lew started to hold up the
cashier

Well I got enough prisoners so I guess he wont be missed But you look
out how yuh git him outa town Better wait til kinda late tonight I
sure would like to see him git a show Them two Collier kids never did
have a square deal far as Ive heard But be careful youngster I want
another term off this county if I can get it Dont go get me in bad

I wont Bud promised and hurried back to Mrs Hansons house

That estimable lady was patting butter in a wooden bowl when Bud went
in She turned and brushed a wisp of gray hair from her face with her
fore arm and shshed him into silent stepping motioning toward an inner
room Bud tiptoed and looked saw Ed Collier fast asleep swaddled in a
blanket and grinned his approval

He made sure that the sleep was genuine also that the blanket swaddling
was efficient Moreover he discovered that Mrs Hanson had very
prudently attached a thin wire to the foot of the blanket cocoon
had passed the wire through a knot hole in a cupboard set into the
partition and to a sheep bell which she no doubt expected to ring upon
provocationsuch as a prisoner struggling to release his feet from a
gray blanket fastened with many large safety pins

He went right to sleep the minute Id fed him and tied him snug
Mrs Hanson murmured He was a sulky divvle and wouldnt give a decent
answer to me till he had his stomach filled From the way he waded into
the ham and eggs I guess a square meal and him has been strangers for a
long time

Sleep and Ed Collier must have been strangers also for Bud attended the
inquest of Lew Morris visited afterwards with Sheriff Cummings who
was full of reminiscence and wanted to remind Bud of everything that had
ever happened within his knowledge during the time when they had been
neighbors with no more than forty miles or so between them The sheriff
offered Bud a horse and saddle which he promised to deliver to the
widows corral after the citizens of Crater had gone to bed And while
he did not say that it would be Eds horse Bud guessed shrewdly that
it would After that Bud carefully slit the lining of his boots tucked
money and checks into the opening he had made and did a very neat
repair job

All that while Ed Collier slept When Bud returned for his supper Ed had
evidently just awakened and was lying on his back biting his lip while
he eyed the wire that ran from his feet to the parting of a pair of
calico curtains He did not see Bud who was watching him through a
crack in the door at the head of the bed Ed was plainly puzzled at the
wire and a bit resentful He lifted his feet until the wire was well
slackened held them poised for a minute and deliberately brought them
down hard on the floor

The result was all that he could possibly have expected Somewhere was
a vicious clang the rattle of a tin pan and the approaching outcry of
a woman Bud retreated to the kitchen to view the devastation and
discovered that a sheep bell not too clean had been dislodged from a
nail and dragged through one pan of milk into another where it was
rolling on its edge stirring the cream that had risen As Mrs Hanson
rushed in from the back yard Bud returned to the angry captives side

Ive got him safe he soothed Mrs Hanson and her shotgun He just
had a nightmare Perhaps that breakfast you fed him was too hearty
Ill look after him now Mrs Hanson We wont be bothering you long
anyway

Mrs Hanson was talking to herself when she went to her milk pans and
Bud released Eddie Collier guessing how humiliating it must be to be
a young fellow pinned into a blanket with safety pins and knowing from
certain experiences of his own that humiliation is quite as apt to breed
trouble as any other emotion

Eddie sat up on the edge of the bed and stared at Bud His eyes were
like Marians in shape and color but their expression was suspicion
defiance and watchfulness blended into one compelling stare that
spelled Fear Or so Bud read it having trapped animals of various
grades ever since he had caught the HAWNTOAD and seen that look many
many times in the eyes of his catch

Howd you like to take a trip with meas a kind of a partner Bud
began carelessly pulling a splinter off the homemade bed for which Mrs
Hanson would not thank himand beginning to whittle it to a sharp point
aimlessly as men have a way of doing when their minds are at work upon
a problem which requiresmuch constructive thinking

Pardner in what Eddie countered sullenly

Pardner in what I am planning to do to make money I can make money
you knowand stay on friendly terms with the sheriff too Thats
better than your bunch has been able to do I dont mind telling
youits stale news I guessthat I cleaned up close to twelve
thousand dollars in less than a month off a working capital of three
thoroughbred horses and about sixty dollars cash And Ill add the
knowledge that I was playing against men that would slip a cold deck
if they played solitaire they were so crooked And if that doesnt
recommend me sufficiently Ill say Im a deputy sheriff of Crater
County and Jesse Cummings knows my past I want to hire you to go with
me and make some money and Ill pay you forty a month and five per cent
bonus on my profits at the end of two years The first year may not show
any profits but the second year will How does it sound to you

He had been rolling a cigarette and now he offered the makings to Ed
who accepted them mechanically his eyes still staring hard at Bud He
glanced toward the door and the one little window where wild cucumber
vines were thickly matted and Bud interpreted his glance

Lew and another Catrockerthe one that tried to rope me down in the
Sinksare dead and three more are in jail Business wont be very
brisk with the Catrock gang for a while

If youre trying to bribe me into squealing on the rest youre a damn
fool said Eddie harshly I aint the squealing kind You can lead me
over to jail first Id rather take my chances with the others He was
breathing hard when he finished

Rather than work for me Bud sliced off the sharp point which he had
so carefully whittled and began to sharpen a new one Eddie watched him
fascinatedly

Rather than squeal on the bunch Theres no other reason in Gods world
why youd make me an offer like that I aint a fool quite if my head
does run up to a peak

Bud chewed his lip whittled and finally threw the splinter away When
he turned toward Eddie his eyes were shiny

Kid youre breaking your sisters heart following this trail Id
like to see you give her a chance to speak your name without blinking
back tears Id like to see her smile all the way from her dimples to
her eyes when she thinks of you Thats why I made the offerthat and
because I think youd earn your wages

Eddie looked at him looked away staring vacantly at the wall His
eyelashes were blinking very fast his lip began to tremble YouII
never wanted toI aint worth savingoh hell I never had a chance
before He dropped sidewise on the bed buried his face in his arms
and sobbed hoarsely like the boy he was



CHAPTER NINETEEN BUD RIDES THROUGH CATROCK AND LOSES MARIAN

Youll have to show me the trail pardner said Bud when they were
making their way cautiously out of town by way of the tin can suburbs
I could figure out the direction all right and make it by morning but
seeing you grew up here Ill let you pilot

Youll have to tell me where you want to go first said Eddie with a
good deal of sullenness still in his voice

Little Lost Without intending to do so Bud put a good deal of
meaning in his voice

Eddie did not say anything but veered to the right climbing higher
on the slope than Bud would have gone We can take the high trail he
volunteered when they stopped to rest the horses It takes up over the
summit and down Burroback Valley Its longer but the stage road
edges along the Sinks andit might be rough going after we get down a
piece

How about the sidehill trail through Catrock Peak

Eddie turned sharply In the starlight Bud was watching him wondering
what he was thinking

Howd you get next to any sidehill trail Eddie asked after a minute
You been over it

I surely have And I expect to go again tonigh A young fellow about
your size is going to act a pilot and get me to Little Lost as quick as
possible Itll be daylight at that

If you got another day coming it better be before daylight we get
there Eddie retorted glumly H hesitated turned his horse and led the
way down the slope angling down away from the welltravelled trail over
the summit of Gold Gap

That hesitation told Bud without words how tenuous was his hold
upon Eddie He possessed sufficient imagination to know that his own
carefully discipline past sheltered from actual contact with evil had
given him little enough by which to measure the soul of a youth like
Eddie Collier

How long Eddie had supped and slept with thieves and murderers Bud
could only guess From the little that Marian had told him Eddies
father had been one of the gang At least she had plainly stated that
he and Lew had been partnersthough Collier might have been ranching
innocently enough and ignorant of Lews real nature

At all events Eddie was a lad well schooled in inequity such as the
wilderness fosters in sturdy fashion Wide spaces give room for great
virtues and great wickedness Bud felt that he was betting large odds on
an unknown quantity He was placing himself literally in the hands of an
acknowledged Catrocker because of the clean gaze of a pair of eyes the
fine curve of the mouth

For a long time they rode without speech Eddie in the lead Bud
following alert to every little movement in the sage every little
sound of the night That was what we rather naively call second
nature habit born of Buds growing years amongst dangers which every
pioneer family knows Alert he was yet deeply dreaming a tenuous dream
too sweet to come true he told himself a dream which he never dared to
dream until the cool stars and the little night wind began to whisper
to him that Marian was free from the brute that had owned her He
scarcely dared think of it yet Shyly he remembered how he had held
her hand to give her courage while they rode in darkness her poor
workroughened little hand that had been old when he took it first
and had warmed in his clasp He remembered how he had pressed her hands
together when they partedwhy surely it was longer ago than last
nightand had kissed them reverently as he would kiss the fingers of a
queen

Hells too good for Lew Morris he blurted unexpectedly the thought
of Marians bruised cheek coming like a blow

Want to go and tell him so If you dont yuh better shut up Eddie
whispered fierce warning You neednt think all the Catrockers are dead
or in jail Theys a few left and theyd kill yuh quickern theyd take
a drink

Bud embarrassed at the emotion behind his statement rather than
ashamed of the remark itself made no reply

Much as Eddie desired silence he himself pulled up and spoke again when
Bud had ridden close

I guess you come through the Gap he whispered Theys a shorter way
than thatSis dont know it Its one the bunch uses a lotif they
catch usI can save my hide by makin out I led you into a trap Youll
get yours anyway How much sand you got

Bud leaned and spat into the darkness Not much Maybe enough to get
through this scary shortcut of yours

You tell the truth when you say scary Its so darn crazy to go down
Catrock Canyon maybe they wont think wed tackle it And if they catch
us Ill say I led yuh inand thensay Im kinda bettin on your
luck The way you cleaned up on them horses maybe luckll stay with
you And Ill help all I can honest

Fine Bud reached over and closed his fingers around Eddies thin
boyish arm You didnt tell me yet why the other trail isnt good
enough

I heard a sound in the Gap tunnel thats why You maybe didnt
know what it was I know them echoes to a fareyewell Somebodys
therelikely posted waiting He was motionless for a space listening

Get offeasy Take off your spurs Eddie was down whispering eagerly
to Bud Theres a draft of air from the blowholes that comes this way
Sound comes outa there a lot easier than it goes in Sis and I found
that out Lead your horseif they jump us give him a lick with the
quirt and hide in the brush

Like Indians the two made their way down a rambling slope not far from
where Marian had guided Bud Tonight however Eddie led the way to the
right instead of the left which seemed to Bud a direction that would
bring them down Oldman creek that dry river bed and finally perhaps
to the race track

Eddie never did explain just how he made his way through a maze of
watercut pillars and heaps of sandstone so bewildering that Bud
afterward swore that in spite of the fact that he was leading Sunfish
he frequently found himself at that patient animals tail where they
were doubled around some freakish pillar Frequently Eddie stopped and
peered past his horse to make sure that Bud had not lost the trail
And finally because he was no doubt worried over that possibility he
knotted his rope to his saddle horn brought back a length that reached
a full pace behind the tail of the horse and placed the end in Buds
hand

If yuh lose me youre a goner he whispered So hang onto that no
matter what comes And dont yuh speak to me This is hells corral and
were walking the top trail right now He made sure that Bud had the
loop in his hand then slipped back past his horse and went on walking
more quickly

Bud admitted afterwards that he was perfectly willing to be led like a
tame squirrel around the top of hells corral whatever that was All
that Bud saw was an intricate assembly of those terrific pillars whose
height he did not know since he had no time to glance up and estimate
the distance There was no method no channel worn through in anything
that could be called a line Whatever primeval torrent had honeycombed
the ledge had left it so before ever its waters had formed a straight
passage through How Eddie knew the way he could only conjecture
remembering how he himself had ridden devious trails down on the
Tomahawk range when he was a boy It rather hurt his pride to realize
that never had he seen anything approaching this madmans trail

Without warning they plunged into darkness again Darkness so black
that Bud knew they had entered another of those mysterious subterranean
passages which had created such names as abounded in the country
the Sinks Little Lost and Sunk River itself which disappeared
mysteriously He was beginning to wonder with a grim kind of humor if he
himself was not about to follow the example of the rivers and disappear
when the soft padding of their footfalls blurred under the whistling of
wind Fine particles of sand stung him a blast full against him
halted him for a second But the rope pulled steadily and he went on
halfdragged into starlight again

They were in a canyon deep sombre in its night shadows its width made
known to him by the strip of starlight overhead Directly before them
not more than a hundred yards a light shone through a window

The rope slackened in his hands and Eddie slipped back to him shivering
a little as Bud discovered when he laid a hand on his arm

I guess I better tie yuhbut it wont be so yuh cant shoot Get on
and let me tie your feet into the stirrups II guess maybe we can get
past all rightIll tryI want to go and take that job you said youd
give me

Whats the matter son Is that where the Catrockers hang out Bud
swung into the saddle I trust you kid Youre her brother

II want to live like Sis wants me to But Ive got to tie yuh Mr
Birnie and that looksBut theyd kyou dont know how they kill
traitors I saw one He leaned against Buds leg one hand reaching up
to the saddle horn and gripping it in a passing frenzy If you say so
he whispered rapidly well sneak up and shoot em through the window
before they get a chance

Bud reached out his hand and patted Eddie on the shoulder That job of
yours dont call for any killing we can avoid he said Go ahead and
tie me No use of wasting lead on two men when one will do Its all
right I trust you pardner

Eddies shoulders stiffened He stood up looked toward the light and
gripped Buds hand I thought theyd be asleepwhat was home
he said We got to ride past the cabin to get out through another
waterwash But you take your coat and tie your horses feet and Ill
tie mine Icant tie you Mr Birnie Well chance it together

Bud did not say anything at all for which Eddie seemed grateful They
muffled eight hoofs rode across the canyons bottom and passed the
cabin so closely that the light of a smoky lantern on a table was
plainly visible to Bud as was the shaggy profile of a man who sat with
his arms folded glowering over a pipe He heard nothing Bud halted
Sunfish and looked again to make sure while Eddie beckoned frantically
They went on undisturbedthe Catrockers kept no dogs

They passed a couple of corrals rode over springy sod where Bud dimly
discerned hay stubble Eddie let down a set of bars replaced them
carefully and they crossed another meadow It struck Bud that the
Catrockers were fairly well entrenched in their canyon with plenty of
horse feed at least

They followed a twisting trail along the canyons wall rode into
another pit of darkness came out into a sandy stretch that seemed
hazily familiar to Bud They crossed this dove into the bushes
following a dim trail and in ten minutes Eddies horse backed suddenly
against Sunfishs nose Bud stood in his stirrups reins held firmly in
his left hand and in his right his sixshooter with the hammer lifted
ready to snap down

A tall figure stepped away from the peaked rocks and paused at Buds
side

I been waiting for Marian he said bluntly You know anything about
her

She turned back last night after she had shown me the way Buds
throat went dry Did they miss her He leaned aggressively

Not till breakfast time they didnt I was waiting here most all
nightexcept right after you folks left She wasnt missed and I never
flagged herand she aint showed up yet

Bud sat there stunned trying to think what might have happened Those
dark passages through the mountainsthe ledge Ed you know that
trail she took me over She was coming back that way She could get
lost

No she couldntnot Sis If her horse didnt act the foolwhat horse
was it she rode Ed turned to Jerry as if he would know

Boise Bud spoke quickly as though seconds were precious She said
he knew the way

He sure ought to Eddie replied emphatically Boise belongs to Sis
by rights The mare got killed and Dad gave him to Sis when he was a
suckin colt and Sis raised him on cows milk and broke him herself
She rode him all over Lew took and sold him to Dave and gambled the
money and Sis never signed no bill of sale They couldnt make her
Sis has got spunk once you stir her up Shell tackle anything Shes
always claimed Boise is hers Boise knows the Gap like a book Sis
couldnt get off the trail if she rode him

Something happened then Bud muttered stubbornly Four men came
through behind us and we waited out in the dark to let them pass Then
she sent me down to the creekbottom and she turned back If they got
her He turned Sunfish in the narrow brush trail Shes hurt or they
got herIm going back he said grimly

Hell you cant do any good alone Eddie protested coming after him
Well go look for her Mr Birnie but weve got to have something so
we can see If Jerry could dig up a couple of lanterns

You wait Im coming along Jerry called guardedly Ill bring
lanterns

To Bud that time of waiting was torment He had faced danger and tragedy
since he could toddle and fear had never overridden the titillating
sense of adventure But then the danger had been for himself Now terror
conjured pictures whose horror set him trembling Twentyfour hours and
more had passed since he had kissed Marians hand and let her goto
what The inky blackness of those tunnelled caverns in the Gap
confronted his mind like a nightmare He could not speak of ithe dared
not think of it and yet he must

Jerry came on horseback with three unlighted lanterns held in a cluster
by their wire handles Eddie immediately urged his horse into the brushy
edge of the trail so that he might pass Bud and take the lead You sure
made quick time he remarked approvingly to Jerry

I raided Daves cache of whiskey or Id have been here quicker Jerry
explained We might need some

Bud gritted his teeth Ride why dont yuh he urged Eddie harshly
What the hell ails that horse of yours You got him hobbled

Eddie glanced back over his bobbing shoulder as his horse trotted along
the blind trail through the brush This here aint no race track he
expostulated Well make it quicker without no broken legs

There was justice in his protest and Bud said nothing But Sunfishs
head bumped the tail of Eddies horse many times during that ride Once
in the Gap with a lighted lantern in his rein hand and his sixshooter
in the otherbecause it was ticklish riding in there with lights
revealing them to anyone who might be coming throughhe was content to
go slowly peering this way and that as he rode

Once Eddie halted and turned to speak to them I know Boise wouldnt
leave the trail If Sis had to duck off and hide from somebody hed
come back to the trail Loose hed do that Sis and I used to explore
around in here just for fun and kept it for our secret till Lew found
out She always rode Boise Im dead sure hed bring her out all right

She hasnt come outyet Go on said Bud and Eddie rode forward
obediently

Three hours it took them to search the various passages where Eddie
thought it possible that Marian had turned aside Bud saw that the trail
through was safe as any such trail could be and he wondered at the
nerve and initiative of the girl and the boy who had explored the place
and found where certain queer twists and turns would lead Afterwards he
learned that Marian was twelve and Eddie ten when first they had hidden
there from Indians and they had been five years in finding where every
passage led Also in daytime the place was not so fearsome since
sunlight slanted down into many a passageway through the blowholes high
above

She aint here I knew she wasnt Eddie announced when the final
tunnel let them into the graying light of dawn beyond the Peak

In that case Bud glanced from him to Jerry who was blowing out his
lantern

Jerry let down the globe carefully at the same time glancing soberly
at Bud The kid knows better than we do what would happen if Lew met up
with her and Boise

Eddie shook his head miserably his eyes fixed helpessly upon Bud Lew
never Mr Birnie I was with him every minute from dark tilltill the
cashier shot him We come up the way I took you through the canyon Lew
never knew she was gone any more than I did

Jerry bit his lip Kid what if the gang run acrost her KNOWING Lew
was dead he grated And her on Boise The words out that Bud stole
Boise Dave and the boys rode out to round him upand they aint done
it so theyre still ridingwell hope Kid you know damn well your
gang would doublecross Dave in a minute now Lews killed If they got
hold of the horse do yuh think theyd turn him over to Dave

No you bet your life they wouldnt Eddie retorted

And what about HER Bud cut in with ominous calm Shes your sister
kid Would you be worried if you knew they had HER and the horse

Eddie gulped and looked away They wouldnt hurt her unless they knewt
Lew was dead he said And them that went to Crater was killed or
jailed so He hesitated It looked to me like Anse was setting up
waiting for the bunch to get back from Crater Hehes always jumpy
when they go off and stay and itd be just like him to set there and
wait till daylight It looks to me Mr Birnie like him andand the
rest dont know yet that the Crater job was a fizzle They wouldnt
think of such a thing as taking Sis or Boise either unless they knew
Lew was dead

Are you sure of that Bud had him in a grip that widened the boys
eyes with something approaching fear

Yes sir Mr Birnie Im sure What didnt go to Crater stayed in
campor was gone on some other trip No Im sure He jerked away with
sudden indignation at Buds disbelief Say Do you think Im bad enough
to let my sister get into trouble with the Catrockers I know they never
got her Moren likely its Dave

Dave went up Burroback Valley Jerry stated flatly Him and the boys
wasnt on this side the ridge They had it sized up that Bud might go
from Crater straight across into Black Rim and they rode up to catch
him as he comes back across Jerry grinned a little They wanted that
money you peeled off the crowd Sunday Bud They was willing you should
get to Crater and cash them checks before they overhauled yuh and strung
yuh up

You dont suppose theyd hurt Marian if they found her with the horse
She might have followed along to Crater

She never Eddie contradicted And Jerry declared in the same breath
Shed be too much afraid of Lew No if they found her with the horse
theyd take him away from her and send her back on another one to do
the kitchen work he conjectured with some contempt If they found YOU
without the horsewellmen have been hung on suspicion Bud Moneys
something everybody wants and there aint a man in the valley but what
has figured your winnings down to the last twobit piece Its just a
runnin match now to see what bunch gets to yuh first

Oh the money Id give the whole of it to anyone that would tell me
Marian s safe Bud cried unguardedly in his misery Whereat Jerry and
Ed looked at each other queerly



CHAPTER TWENTY PICK YOUR FOOTING

The three sat irresolutely on their horses at the tunnels end of the
Gap staring out over the valley of the Redwater and at the mountains
beyond Buds face was haggard and the lines of his mouth were hard It
was so vast a country in which to look for one little woman who had not
gone back to see Jerrys signal

Ill bet yuh Sis cleared out Eddie blurted looking at Bud eagerly
as if he had been searching for some comforting word Sis has got lots
of sand She used to call me a fraid cat all the time when I didnt
want to go where she did Ill bet she just took Boise and run off with
him She would if she made up her mindand I guess shed had about as
much as she could stand cookin at Little Lost

Bud lifted his head and looked at Eddie like a man newly awakened I
gave her money to take home for me to my mother down Laramie way I
begged her to go if she was liable to be in trouble over leaving the
ranch But she said she wouldnt gonot unless she was missed She knew
Id come back to the ranch I just piled her hands full of bills in the
dark and told her to use them if she had to

She might have done it Jerry hazarded hopefully Maybe she did sneak
in some other way and get her things Shed have to take some clothes
along Women folks always have to pack By gosh she could hide Boise
out somewhere and

For a young man in danger of being lynched by his boss for horse
stealing and waylaid and robbed by a gang notorious in the country
Buds appetite for risk seemed insatiable that morning For he added the
extreme possibility of breaking his neck by reckless riding in the next
hour

He swung Sunfish about and jabbed him with the spurs ducking into the
gloom of the Gap as if the two who rode behind were assassins on his
trail Once he spoke and that was to Sunfish His tone was savage

Damn your lazy hide youve been through here twice and youve got
daylight to helpnow pick up your feet and travel

Sunfish travelled and the pace he set sent even Jerry gasping now and
then when he came to the worst places with the sound of galloping hoofs
in the distance before him and Eddie coming along behind and lifting
his voice warningly now and then Even the Catrockers had held the Gap
in respect and had ridden its devious trail cautiously But caution was
a meaningless word to Bud just then while a small flame of hope burned
steadily before him

The last turn where on the first trip Sunfish lost Boise and balked for
a minute he made so fast that Sunfish left a patch of yellowish hair
on a pointed rock and came into the open snorting fire of wrath He went
over the rough ground like a bouncing antelope simply because he was
too mad to care how many legs he broke At the peak of rocks he showed
an inclination to stop and Bud who had been thinking and planning
while he hoped pulled him to a stand and waited for the others to come
up They could not go nearer the corrals without incurring the danger of
being overheard and that must not happen

You damn fool gritted Jerry when he came up with Bud If Id knowed
you wanted to commit suicide Id a caved your head in with a rock and
saved myself the craziest ride I ever took in m life

Oh shut up Bud snapped impatiently Were here arent we Now
listen to me boys You catch up my horsesJerry are you coming along
with me You may as well Im a deputy sheriff and if anybody stops you
for whatever youve done Ill show a warrant for your arrest And by
thunder he declared with a faint grin Ill serve it if I have to
to keep you with me I dont know what youve done and I dont care I
want you So catch up my horsesand Jerry you can pack my warbag and
roll your bed and mine if Im too busy while Im here

Youre liable to be busy all right Jerry interpolated grimly

Well they wont bother you Ed you better get the horses Take
Sunfish here and graze him somewhere outa sight Well keep going and
we might have to start suddenly

How about Sis I thought

Im going to turn Little Lost upside down to find her if shes here
If she isnt Im kinda hoping she went down to mother She said there
was no other place where she could go And shed feel that she had to
deliver the money perhapsbecause I must have given her a couple of
thousand dollars It was quite a roll mostly in fifties and hundreds
and Im short that much Im just gambling that the size of made her
feel she must go

Thatd be Sis all over Mr Birnie Eddie glanced around him uneasily
The sun was shining level in his eyes and sunlight to Eddie had long
meant danger I guess we better hurry then Ill get the horses down
outa sight and come back here afoot and wait

Do that kid said Bud slipping wearily off Sunfish He gave the
reins into Eddies hand motioned Jerry with his head to follow and
hurried down the winding path to the corrals The cool brilliance of the
morning the cheerful warbling of little wild canaries in the bushes
as he passed for once failed to thrill him with joy of life He was
wondering whether to go straight to the house and search it if necessary
to make sure that she had not been there or whether Indian cunning
would serve him best His whole being ached for direct action his heart
trembled with fear lest he should jeopardize Marians safety by his
impetuous haste to help her

Pop coming from the stable just as Bud was crossing the corral settled
the question for him Pop peered at him sharply put a hand to the small
of his back and came stepping briskly toward him his jaw working like a
sheep eating hay

Afoot air ye he exclaimed curiously Whatfer idea yuh got in yore
head now young feller Comin back here afoot when ye rid two fast
horses Neednt be afraid of ole Popnot unless yuh lie to im and try
to git somethin fur nothin Made off with Lews wife too didnt ye
Oh there aint much gits past ole Pop even if he aint the man he used
to be I seen yuh lookin at her when yuh oughta been eatin I seen
yuh An her watchin you when she thought nobuddyd ketch her at it
Sho Shucks amighty You been playin hell all around now aint ye
Neednt lieI know what my own eyes tells me

You know a lot then that I wish I knew Ive been in Crater all the
time Pop Did you know Lew was mixed up in a bank robbery yesterday
and the cashier of the bank shot him The rest of the gang is dead or in
jail The sheriff did some good work there for a few minutes

Pop pinched in his lips and stared at Bud unwinkingly for a minute
Dont lie to me he warned petulantly Went to Crater did ye Cashed
them checks I expect

Bud pulled his mouth into a rueful grin Yes Pop I cashed the checks
all rightand heres whats left of the money I guess he went
on while he pulled out a small roll of bills and licked his finger
preparatory to counting them I might better have stuck to running my
horses Pokers sure a fright The way it can eat into a mans pocket

Went and lost all that money on poker did ye Pops voice was shrill
After me tellin yuh how to git itand showin yuh how yuh could beat
Boise the old mans rage choked him He thrust his face close to
Buds and glared venomously

Yes and just to show you I appreciate it Im going to give you whats
left after Ive counted off enough to see me through to Spokane I feel
sick Pop I want change of air And as for riding two fast horses to
Crater he paused while he counted slowly Pop licking his lips avidly
as he watchedwhy I dont know what you mean I only ride one horse
at a time Pop when Im sober And I was sober till I hit Crater

He stopped counting when he reached fifty dollars and gave the rest to
Pop who thumbed the bank notes in a frenzy of greed until he saw that
he had two hundred dollars in his possession The glee which he tried
to hide the crafty suspicion that this was not all of it the returning
conviction that Bud was actually almost penniless and the cunning
assumption of senility was pictured on his face Pops poor miserly
soul was for a minute shamelessly revealed Distraught though he was
Bud stared and shuddered a little at the spectacle

I always said t youre a good honest wellmeaning boy Pop cackled
slyly putting the money out of sight while he patted Bud on the
shoulder Dave he thought mebby you took and stole Boiseand if I was
you Bud Id git to Spokane quick as I could and not let Dave ketch ye
Daves out now lookin for ye If he suspicioned youd have the gall to
come right back to Little Lost I expect mebby hed string yuh up young
feller Daves got a nasty temperhe has so

Theres something else Pop that I dont like very well to be accused
of You say Mrs Morris is gone I dont know a thing about that or
about the horse being gone Ive been in Crater Id just got my money
out of the bank when it was held up and Lew was shot

Pop teetered and gummed his tobacco and grinned foxily Shucks I dont
care nothin about Lews wife goin ner I dont care nothin much about
the horse They aint no funral uh mine Bud Dave an Lew let em look
after their own belongins

Theyll have to far as Im concerned said Bud What would I want
of a horse I can beat any time I want to run mine Dave must think Im
scared to ride fast since Sunday And Pop Ive got troubles enough
without having a woman on my hands Are you sure Marians gone

SURE Pop snorted Honey shes had to do the cookin for me an
Jerryand if I aint sure

Bud did not wait to hear him out There was Honey whom he would very
much like to avoid meeting so the sooner he made certain of Marians
deliberate flight the better since Honey was not an early riser He
went to the house and entered by way of the kitchen feeling perfectly
sure all the while that Pop was watching him The disorder there was
sufficiently convincing that Marian was gone so he tiptoed across the
room to a door through which he had never seen any one pass save Lew and
Marian

It was her bedroom meagrely furnished but in perfect order On the
goodsbox dresser with a wavyglassed mirror above it her hair brush
comb and a few cheap toilet necessities lay with the comb across a
nail file as if she had put it down hurriedly before going out to serve
supper to the men Marian then had not stolen home to pack things
for the journey as Jerry had declared a woman would do Bud sent a
lingering glance around the room and closed the door Hope was still
with him but it was darkened now with doubts

In the kitchen again he hesitated wanting his guitar and mandolin and
yet aware of the foolishness of burdening himself with them now Food
was a different matter however Dave owed him for more than three weeks
of hard work in the hayfield so Bud collected from the pantry as much
as he could carry and left the house like a burglar

Pop was fiddling with the mower that stood in front of the machine shed
plainly waiting for whatever night transpire And since the bunkhouse
door was in plain view and not so far away as Bud wished it he went
boldly over to the old man carrying his plunder on his shoulder

Dave owes me for work Pop so I took what grub I needed he explained
with elaborate candor Ill show you what Ive got so youll know Im
not taking anything that Ive no right to He set down the sack
opened it and looked up into what appeared to be the largestmuzzled
sixshooter he had ever seen in his life Sheer astonishment held him
there gaping half stooped over the sack

No ye dont young feller Pop snarled vindictively Yuh think
Id let a horse thief git off n this ranch whilst Im able to pull a
trigger You fork her that money you got on ye first thing yuh do its
mine by rightsI told yuh Id help ye to win money off n the valley
crowd and I done it An what does you do Never pay a mite of
attention to me after Id give ye all the inside workins of the
gamenever offer to give me my shareno by Christmas you go steal a
horse of my sons and hide him out somewheres and go lose mighty near
all I helped yuh win playin poker Think Im goin to stand for that
Think two hundred dollars is goin to even things up when I helped ye to
win a fortune Hand over that fifty you got on yuh

Very meekly his face blank Bud reached into his pocket and got the
money Without a word he pulled two or three dollars in silver from his
trousers pockets and added that to the lot Now what he wanted to
know

Now Youll wait till Dave gits here to hang yuh fer horsestealing
shrilled Pop Jerry Oh Jerry Where be yuh I got im by
ChristmasI got the horse thiefcaught him carryin good grub right
outa the house

Look out Jerry called Bud glancing quickly toward the bunkhouse

Now Pop had without doubt been a man difficult to trick in his youth
but he was old and he was excited tickled over his easy triumph He
turned to see what was wrong with Jerry

Look out Pop you old fool Youll bust a bloodvessel if you dont
quiet down Bud censured mockingly wresting the gun from the clawing
struggling old man in his arms He was surprised at the strength and
agility of Pop and though he was forcing him backward step by step into
the machine shed and knew that he was master of the situation he had
his hands full

Wildcats is nothing to Pop when he gets riled Jerry grinned coming
up on the run I kinda expected something like this What yuh want done
with him Bud

Gag him so he cant holler his head off and then take him alongwhen
Ive got my money back Bud panted Pop youre about as appreciative
as a buck Injun

Going to be hard to pack him so hell ride Jerry observed quizzically
when Pop bound and gagged lay glaring at them behind the bunkhouse
He dont quite balance your two grips Bud And we do need hat grub

You bring the grubIll take Pop Bud stopped in the act of
lifting the old man and listened Honeys voice was calling Pop with
embellishments such Bud would never have believed a part of Honeys
vocabulary From her speech she was coming after him and Pops jaws
worked frantically behind Buds handkerchief

Jerry tilted his head toward the luggage he had made a second trip for
picked up Pop clamped his hand over the mouth that was trying to betray
them and slipped away through the brush glancing once over his shoulder
to make sure that Bud was following him

They reached the safe screen of branches and stopped there for a minute
listening to Honeys vituperations and her threats of what she would do
to Pop if he did not come up and start a fire

She stopped and hoofbeats sounded from the main road Dave and his men
were coming

In his heart Bud thanked Little Lost for that hidden path through the
bushes He heard Dave asking Honey what was the matter with her heard
the unwomanly reply of the girl heard her curse Pop for his neglect
of the kitchen stove at that hour of the morning Heard too her
questioning of Dave Had they found Bud or Marian

If you got em together and didnt string em both up to the nearest
tree

Bud bit his lip and went on his face aflame with rage at the
brutishness of a girl he had half respected Honey he whispered
contemptuously What a name for that little beast

At the rocks Eddie was waiting with Stopper upon whom they hurriedly
packed the beds and Buds luggage They spoke in whispers when they
spoke at all and to insure the horses remaining quiet Eddie had tied a
cotton rope snugly around its muzzle

Ill take Pop Bud whispered but Jerry shook his head and once more
shouldered the old fellow as he would carry a bag of grain So they
slipped back down the trail took a turn which Bud did not know and
presently Bud found that Jerry was keeping straight on Bud made an
Indian sign on the chance that Jerry would understand it and with his
free hand Jerry replied He was taking Pop somewhere They were to wait
for him when they had reached the horses So they separated for a space

This is sure a great country for hideouts Mr Birnie Eddie ventured
when they had put half a mile between themselves and Little Lost and
had come upon Smoky Sunfish and Eddies horse feeding quietly in a
tiny springwatered basin half surrounded with rocks If you know the
country you can keep dodgin sheriffs all your lifeif you just have
grub enough to last

Looks to me as if there arent many wasted opportunities here Bud
answered with some irony Is there an honest man in the whole country
Ed Id just like to know

Eddie hesitated his eyes anxiously trying to read Buds meaning and his
mood Not right around the Sinks I guess he replied truthfully Up
at Crater there are some and over to Jumpoff But I guess this valley
would be called pretty tough all right Its so full of caves and
queer places it kinda attracts the ones that want to hide out Then he
grinned Its lucky for you its like that Mr Birnie or I dont see
how youd get away Now I can show you how to get clear away from here
without getting caught But I guess we ought to have breakfast first
Im pretty hungry Aint you I can build a fire against that crack in
the ledge over there and the smoke will go away back underneath so
it wont show Theres a blowhole somewhere that draws smoke like a
chimney

Jerry came after a little sniffing bacon He threw himself down beside
the fire and drew a long breath That old skunks heavier than what you
might think he observed whimsically I packed him down into one of
them sink holes and untied his feet and left him to scramble out best
way he can Itll take him longern it took me Having the use of your
hands helps quite a lot And the use of your mouth to cuss a little
But hell make it in an hour or twoIm afraid He looked at Bud a
halfshamed tenderness in his eyes It sure was hard to leave him like
I did It was like walking on your toes past a rattler curled up asleep
somewhere afraid you might spoil his nap Only Pop wasnt asleep
He sat up and reached his hand for a cup of coffee which Eddie was
offering Anyway I had the fun of telling the old devil what I
thought about him he added and blew away the steam and took another
satisfying nip

Hell put them on our trail I suppose said Bud biting into a ragged
piece of bread with a halfburned slice of hot bacon on it

When he gets to the ranch he will His poison fangs was sure loaded
when I left He said he wanted to cut your heart out for robbing him
and so forth ad swearum Wed best not leave any trail

We aint going to Eddie assured him eagerly Im glad being with
the Catrockers is going to do some good Mr Birnie Itll help you git
away and thatll help find Sis I guess she hit down where you live
maybe How far can your horse travel todayif he has to

Bud looked across to where Sunfish having rolled in a wet spot near
the spring and muddied himself to his satisfaction was greedily at work
upon a patch of grass If he has to till he drops in his tracks And
that wont be for many a mile kid Hes thoroughbred a thoroughbred
never knows when to quit

Well there aint any speedy trail ahead of us today Eddie vouchsafed
cheeringly Theres halfa mile maybe where we can gallop and the rest
is a case of picking your footing

Lets begin picking it then said Bud and got up reaching for his
bridle

By devious ways it was that Eddie led them out of that sinister country
surrounding the Sinks In the beginning Bud and Jerry exchanged glances
and looked at their guns believing that it would be through Catrock
Canyon they would have to ride Eddie riding soberly in the lead had
yet a certain youthful sense of his importance Theyll never think of
following yuh this way unless old Pop Truman gits back in time to tell
em Im travelling with yuh he observed once when they had penetrated
beyond the neighborhood of caves and blowholes and were riding safely
down a canyon that offered few chances of their being observed save from
the front which did not concern them

I guess you dont know old Pop is about the ringeader of the
Catrockers Er he was till he began to git kinda childish about
hoarding money and then Dave stepped in And Mr Birnie I guess youd
have been dead when you first came there if it hadnt been that Dave
and Pop wanted to give you a chance to get a lot of money off of Jeffs
bunch Lew was telling how you kept cleaning up and he said right along
that they was taking too much risk having you around Lew said he bet
you was a detective Are you Mr Birnie

Bud was riding with his shoulders sagged forward his thoughts with
Marianwherever she was He had been convinced that she was not at
Little Lost that she had started for Laramie But now that he was away
from that evil spot his doubts returned What if she were still in the
neighborhoodwhat if they found her Memory of Honeys vindictiveness
made him shiver Honey was the kind of woman who would kill

I am from now on kid he said despondently Were going to ride
till we find your sister And if those hellhounds got her

They didnt from the way Honey talked Jerry comforted Well find
her at Laramie dont you ever think we wont




CHAPTER TWENTYONE TRAILS END

At the last camp just north of the Platte Buds two black sheep
balked Bud himself worn by sleepless nights and long hours in the
saddle turned furiously when Jerry announced that he guessed he and Ed
wouldnt go any farther

Well damn you both for ungrateful hounds grated Bud hurt to the
quick I hope you dont think I brought you this far to help hold me in
the saddle I made it north alone without any mishap I think I could
have come back all right But if you want to quit here all right You
can hightail it back to your outlaws

Well if you go n put it that way Jerry expostulated lifting both
hands high in the air in a vain attempt to pull the situation toward the
humorous Youre a depity sheriff and you got the drop He grinned
saw that Buds eyes were still hard and his mouth unyielding and
lowered his hands looking crestfallen as a kicked pup that had tried to
be friendly

You can see for yourself we aint fit to go n meet your mother
and your father like we waslike wed went straight Eddie put in
explanatorily Youve been raised good andsay it makes a man want
to BE good to see how a feller dont have to be no preacher to live
right But it dont seem square to let you take us right home with you
just because youre so darned kind youd do it and never think a thing
about it We aint ungratefulI know I aint Butbut

The kids said it Bud Jerry came to the rescue We come along
because it was a ticklish trip you had ahead And Ive knowed as good
riders as you are that could stand a little holding in the saddle when
some freak had tried to shoot em out of it But youre close to home
now and you dont need us no more and so we aint going to horn in on
the prodigal calfs milkbucket Marian Shes likely there

If Sis aint with your folks well hunt her up Eddie interrupted
eagerly Sis is your kindsheshes good enough for yuh Bud and I
hope shellwell if shes got any sense she willwell if it comes to
the narrying point Iwell darn it Id like to see Sis git as good a
man as you are Eddie having bluntered that far went headlong as if
he were afraid to stop Sis is educated and shes an awful good singer
and a fine girl only Im her brother But Im going to live honest from
now on Bud and I hope you wont hold off on account of me I
aint going to have sis feel like crying when she thinks about me
Youyousaid something that hurt like a knife Bud when you told me
that up in Crater And she wasnt to blame for marryn Lewand she
done that outa goodness the kind you showed to Jerry and me And we
dont want to go spoilin everything by letting your folks see what
youre bringin home with yuh And it might hurt Sis with your folks if
they found out that Im

Bud had been standing by his horse looking from one to the other
listening watching their faces measuring the full depth of their
manhood Say you remind me of a story the folks tell on me he said
his eyes shining while his voice strove to make light of it all Once
when I was a kid in pinkaprons I got lost from the trailherd my folks
were bringing up from Texas It was comin dark and they had the whole
outfit out hunting me and everybody scared to death When they were all
about crazy they claim I came walking up to the campfire dragging
a dead snake by the tail and carrying a horn toad in my shirt and
claiming they were mine because I ketched em Im not branding that
yarn with any moralbut figure it out for yourself boys

The two looked at each other and grinned I aint dead yet Eddie
made sheepish comment Mebbe you kinda look on me as being a horn toad
Bud

When you bear in mind that my folks raised that kid Youll realize
that it takes a good deal to stampede mother Bud swung into the saddle
to avoid subjecting his emotions to the cramped inadequate limitations
of speech Lets go boys Shes a long trail to take the kinks out of
before suppertime

They stood still making no move to follow Bud reined Smoky around so
that he faced them reached laboriously into that mysterious pocket of
a cowpunchers trousers which is always held closed by the belt of his
chaps and which invariably holds in its depths the things he wants in a
hurry They watched him curiously resolutely refusing to interpret his
bit of autobiography wondering perhaps why he did not go

Here she is Bud had disinterred the deputy sheriffs badge and began
to polish it by the primitive but effectual method of spitting on it and
then rubbing vigorously on his sleeve Youre outside of Crater County
but by thunder youre both guilty of resisting an officer and county
lines dont count He had pinned the badge at random on his coat while
he was speaking and now before the two realized what he was about he
had his sixshooter out and aimed straight at them

Bud had never lived in fear of the law Instantly was sorry when he
saw the involuntary stiffening of their muscles the quick wordless
suspicion and defiance that sent their eyes in shifty glances to right
and left before their hands lifted a little Trust him love him they
might there was that latent fear of capture driven deep into their
souls so deep that even he had not erased it

Bud sawand so he laughed

Ive got to show my folks that Ive made a gathering he said You
cant quit boys And Im going to take you to the end of the trail now
youve started He eyed them saw that they were still stubborn and
drew in his breath sharply manfully meeting the question in their
minds

Weve left more at the Sinks than the gnashing of teeth he said
whimsically A couple of bad names for instance Youre two bully
good friends of mine anddamn it Marian will want to see both of you
fellows if shes there If she isntwell maybe have a big circle
to ride finding her Ill need you no matter whats ahead He looked
from one to the other gave a snort and added impatiently Aw fork
your horses and dont stand there looking like a couple of damn fools

Whereupon Jerry shook his head dissentingly grinned and gave Eddie so
emphatic an impulse toward his horse that the kid went sprawling

Guess Were up against it all rightbut I do wish yo d lose that
badge Jerry surrendered and flipped the bridle reins over the neck of
his horse Horn toad is right the way youre scabbling around amongst
them rocks he called lightheartedly to the kid Ever see a purtier
sunrise I never

I dont know what they thought of the sunset Gorgeous it was with many
soft colors blended into unnamable tints and translucencies and the
songs of birds in the thickets as they passed Smoky Sunfish and
Stopper walked briskly ears perked forward heads up eyes eager to
catch the familiar landmarks that meant home Buds head was up also
his eyes went here and there resting with a careless affection on those
same landmarks which spelled home He would have let Smokys reins have
a bit more slack and would have led his little convoy to the corrals
at a gallop had not hope begun to tremble and shrink from meeting
certainty face to face Had you asked him then I think Bud would have
owned himself a coward Until he had speech with homefolk he would
merely be hoping that Marian was there but until he had speech with
them he need not hear that they knew nothing of her Budlike however
he tried to cover his trepidation with a joke

Well sneak up on em he said to Ed and Jerry when the roofs of
house and stables came into view

Heres where I grew up boys And in a minute or two more youll see
the greatest little mother on earthand the finest dad he added
swallowing the last of his Scotch stubbornness

And Sis I hope Eddie said wistfully I sure hope shes here

Neither Jerry nor Bud answered him at all Smoky threw up his head
suddenly and gave a shrill whinny and a horse at the corrals answered
sonorously

Say That sounds to me like Boise Eddie exclaimed standing up in his
stirrups to look

Bud turned pale then flushed hotly Dont holler he muttered and
held Smoky back a little For just one reason a young mans heart pounds
as Buds heart pounded then Jerry looked at him took a deep breath
and bit his lip thoughtfully It may be that Jerrys heartbeats were not
quite normal just then but no one would ever know

They rode slowly to a point near the corner of the table and there Bud
halted the two with his lifted hand Bud was trembling a littlebut he
was smiling too Eddie was frankly grinning Jerrys face was the face
of a good pokerplayerit told nothing

In a group with their backs to them stood three Marian Buds mother
and his father Bob Birnie held Boise by the bridle and the two women
were stroking the brown nose of the horse that moved uneasily with
little impatient headtossings

He doesnt behave like a horse that has made the long trip he has
made Buds mother observed admiringly You must be a wonderful little
horsewoman my dear as well as a wonderful little woman in every other
way Buddy should never have sent you on such a tripjust to bring home
money like a bank messenger But Im glad that he did And I do wish
you would consent to staysuch an afternoon with music I havent had
since Buddy left us You could stay with me and train for the
concert work you intend doing Im only an old ranch woman in a slat
sunbonnetbut I taught my Buddyand have you heard him

An old woman in a slat sunbonnetoh how can you Why youre the most
wonderful woman in the whole world Marians voice was almost tearful
in its protest YesI have heardyour Buddy

T is the strangest way to go about selling a horse that I ever saw
Bob Birnie put in dryly smoothing his beard while he looked at them
Wed be glad to have you stay lass But youve asked me to place a
price on the horse and I should like to ask ye a question or two How
fast did ye say he could run

Marian laid an arm around the shoulders of the old lady in a slat
sunbonnet and patted her arm while she answered

Well he beat everything in the country so they refused to race
against him until Bud came with his horses she replied It took
Sunfish to outrun him He s terribly fast Mr Birnie Ireally I
think he could beat the worlds recordif Bud rode him

Just here you should picture Ed and Jerry with their hands over their
mouths and Bud wanting to hide his face with his hat

Bob Birnies beard behaved oddly for a minute while he leaned and
stroked Boises flat forelegs that told of speed Weell he
hesitated softheartedness battling with the horsebuyers keenness
since Bud is na ere to ride him hell make a good horse for the
roundup Ill give ye more battlinga hundred and fifty dollars for
him if ye care to sell

Here wait a minute before you sell to that old skinflint Bud shouted
exuberantly dismounting with a rush The rush I may say carried him
to the little old lady in the slat sunbonnet and to that other little
lady who was staring at him with wide bright yes Buds arms went
around his mother Perhaps by accident he gathered in Marian alsothey
were standing very close and his arms were very longand he was slow
to discover his mistake

Ill give you two hundred for Boise and Ill throw in one brother and
one longlegged goodfornothing cowpuncher

Meaning yourself Buddy came teasingly from he slat sunbonnet whose
occupant had not been told just everything Ill be surprised if shell
have you with that dirty face and no shave for a week and more But
if she does youre luckier than you deserve for riding up on us like
this Weve heard all about you Buddythough you were wise to send
this lassie to gild your faults and make a hero of you

Now you want to know how Marian managed to live through that I will
say that she discovered how tenaciously a young mans arms may cling
when he thinks he is embracing merely his mother but she freed herself
and ran to Eddie fairly pulled him off his horse and talked very
fast and incoherently to him and Jerry asking question after question
without waiting for a reply to any of them All this I suppose in the
hope that they would not hear or hearing would not understand what
that terrible wonderful little woman was saying so innocently

But you cannot faze youth Eddie had important news for Sis and he felt
that now was the time to tell it before Marian blushed any redder so
he pulled her face up to his put his lips so close to her ear that his
breath tickled and whisperedwithout any preface whatever that she
could marry Bud any time now because she was a widow

Here SomebodyBudquick Sis has fainted Doggone it I only told
her Lews dead and she can marry youshucks I thought shed be glad

Down on the Staked Plains on an evening much like the evening when Bud
came home with his stake and his hopes and two black sheep who were
becoming white as most of us a campfire began to crackle and wave
smoke ribbons this way and that before it burned steadily under the
supper pots of a certain hungry happy group which you know

Its somewhere about here that I got lost from camp when I was a kid
Bud observed tilting back his hat and lifting a knee to snap a dry
stick over it Motherd know I bet I kinda wish wed brought her and
dad along with us Thats about eighteen years ago they trailed a herd
northand here we are taking our trailherd north on the same trail
I kinda wish now Id picked up a bunch of yearling heifers along with
our twoyearolds We could have brought another hundred head just as
well as not They sure drive nice Mother would have enjoyed this trip

You think so do you Marian gave him a superior little smile along
with the coffeeboiler If youd heard her talk about that trip north
when there werent any men around listening youd change your mind
Bud Birnie you are the SIMPLEST creature You think because a woman
doesnt make a fuss over things she doesnt mind Your mother told me
that it was a perfect nightmare She taught you music just in the hope
that youd go back to civilization and live there where there are some
modern improvements and she could visit you And here you areall
rapped up in a bunch of young stock dirty as pig and your whiskersow
Bud Stop that immediatly or Ill go put my face in a cactus just for
relief

Maybe youre dissatisfied yourself with my bunch of cattle Maybe you
didnt go in raptures over our aim and make more plans in a day than
four men could carry out in a year Maybe you wish your husband was a
man that was content to pound piano keys all his life and let his hair
grow long instead of his whiskers If you hate this why didnt you say
so

I was speaking said Marian as dignifiedly as was possible of your
mother She was raised in civilization and she has simply made the best
of pioneering all her married life I was born and raised in cowcountry
and I love it As I said before you are the SIMPLEST creature Would
you really bring a father and mother a honeymoon trailespecially when
the bride didnt want them and they would much rather stay home

Hey cried Eddie disgustedly coming up from a shallow creek with a
bucket of water and a few dry sticks The coffees upset and putting
the fire out Gee whiz Cant you folks quit lovemakin and tend to
business long enough to cook a meal
