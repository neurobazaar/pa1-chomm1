CHAPTER 1 Lost in a Blizzard

Rowdy Vaughanhe had been christened Rowland by his mother and
rechristened Rowdy by his cowboy friends who are prone to treat with
much irreverence the names bestowed by motherswas not happy He stood
in the stirrups and shook off the thick layer of snow which clung damp
and closepacked to his coat The dull yellow folds were full of it
his gray hat pulled low over his purple ears was heaped with it He
reached up a gloved hand and scraped away as much as he could wrapped
the longskirted sourdough coat around his numbed legs then settled
into the saddle with a shiver of distaste at the plight he was in and
wished himself back at the Horseshoe Bar

Dixie standing kneedeep in a drift shook himself much after the
manner of his master perhaps he also wished himself back at the
Horseshoe Bar He turned his head to look back blinking at the snow
which beat insistently in his eyes he could not hold them open long
enough to see anything however so he twitched his ears pettishly and
gave over the attempt

Its up to you old boy Rowdy told him resignedly Im plumb lost I
never was in this damn country before anyhowand I sure wish I wasnt
here now If youve any idea where were at Im dead willing to have
you pilot the layout Never mind Chub locating his feed when its stuck
under his nose is his limit

Chub lifted an ear dispiritedly when his name was spoken but as was
usually the case he heard no good of himself and dropped his head
again No one took heed of him no one ever did His part was to carry
Vaughans bed and to follow unquestionably where Vaughan and Dixie
might lead He was cold and tired and hungry but his faith in his
master was strong the responsibility of finding shelter before the dark
came down rested not with him

Vaughan pressed his chilled knees against Dixies ribs but the hand
upon the reins was carefully noncommittal so that Dixie having no
suggestion of his masters wish ventured to indulge his own He turned
tail squarely to the storm and went straight ahead Vaughan put his
hands deep into his pockets snuggled farther down into the sheepskin
collar of his coat and rode passive enduring

They brought up against a wire fence and Vaughan rousing from his
apathy tried to peer through the white shifting wall of the storm
Youre a swell guidenot he remarked to the horse Now you you
hike down this fence till you locate a gate or a corner or any darned
thing and I dont give a cuss if the snow does get in your eyes Its
your own fault

Dixie sneezing the snow from his nostrils turned obediently Chub
his feet dragging wearily in the snow trailed patiently behind Half an
hour of this and it seemed as if it would go on forever

Through the swirl Vaughan could see the posts standing forlornly in
the snow with sixteen feet of blizzard between at no time could he
distinguish more than two or three at once and there were long minutes
when the wall stood blank and shifting just beyond the first post

Then Dixie lifted his head and gazed questioningly before him his ears
pointed forwardsentient strainedand whinnied shrill challenge
He hurried his steps dragging Chub out of the beginnings of a dream
Vaughan straightened and took his hands from his pockets

Out beyond the dim wavering outline of the farthest post came answer
to the challenge A mysterious vague shape grew impalpably upon the
strained vision a horse sneezed then nickered eagerly Vaughan drew up
and waited

Hello he called cheerfully Pleasant day this Out for your
health

The shape hesitated as though taken aback by the greeting and there
was no answer Vaughan puzzled rode closer

Say dont talk so fast he yelled I cant follow yuh

Whowho is it The voice sounded perturbed and it was moreover the
voice of a woman

Vaughan pulled up short and swore into his collar Women are not as a
rule to be met out on the blank prairie in a blizzard His voice when
he spoke again was not ironical as it had been it was placating

I beg your pardon he said I thought it was a man Im looking for
the Cross L you dont happen to know where it is do yuh

NoI dont she declared dismally I dont know where any place is
Im teaching school in this neighborhoodor in some other I was going
to spend Sunday with a friend but this storm came up and Imlost

Same here said Rowdy pleasantly as though being lost was a matter
for congratulation

Oh I was in hopes

So was I so were even there Well have to pool our chances I guess
Any gate down that wayor havent you followed the fence

I followed it for miles and milesit seemed It must be some big field
of the Cross L but they have so very many big fields

And you couldnt give a rough guess at how far it is to the Cross
Linsinuatingly

He could vaguely see her shake of head Ordinarily it should be about
six miles beyond Rodways where I board But I havent the haziest idea
of where Rodways place is you see so that wont help you much Im
all at sea in this snow Her voice was rueful

Well if you came up the fence theres no use going back that way and
theres sure nothing made by going away from itthats the way I came
Why not go on the way youre headed

We might as well I suppose she assented and Rowdy turned and rode
by her side grateful for the plurality of the pronoun which tacitly
included him in her wanderings and meditating many things For one he
wondered if she were as nice a girl as her voice sounded He could not
see much of her face because it was muffled in a white silk scarf Only
her eyes showed and they were dark and bright

When he awoke to the fact that the wind grown colder beat upon her
cruelly he dropped behind a pace and took the windy side that he might
shield her with his body But if she observed the action she gave no
sign her face was turned from him and the wind and she rode without
speaking After long plodding the line of posts turned unexpectedly a
right angle and Vaughan took a long relieved breath

Well have the wind on our backs now he remarked I guess we may as
well keep on and see where this fence goes to

His tone was too elaborately cheerful to be very cheering He was
wondering if the girl was dressed warmly It had been so warm and sunny
before the blizzard struck but now the wind searched out the thin
places in ones clothing and ran lead in ones bones where should be
simply marrow He fancied that her voice when she spoke gave evidence
of actual sufferingand the heart of Rowdy Vaughan was ever soft toward
a woman

If youre cold he began Ill open up my bed and get out a blanket
He held Dixie in tentatively

Oh dont trouble to do that she protested but there was that in her
voice which hardened his impulse into fixed resolution

I ought to have thought of it before he lamented and swung down
stiffly into the snow

Her eyes followed his movement with a very evident interest while
he unbuckled the pack Chub had carried since sunrise and drew out a
blanket

Stand in your stirrup he commanded briskly and Ill wrap you up
Its a Navajo and the wind will have a time trying to find a thin
spot

Youre thoughtful She snuggled into it thankfully I was cold

Vaughan tucked it around her with more care than haste He was pretty
uncomfortable himself and for that reason he was the more anxious
that the girl should be warm It came to him that she was a cute little
schoolmaam all right he was glad she belonged close around the Cross
L He also wished he knew her nameand so he set about finding it out
with much guile

Hows that he wanted to know when he had made sure that her
feetsuch tiny feetwere well covered He thought it lucky that she
did not ride astride after the manner of the latterday young woman
because then he could not have covered her so completely Hold on That
windy sides going to make trouble He unbuckled the strap he wore
to hold his own coat snug about him and put it around the girls slim
waist feeling idiotically happy and guilty the while It dont come
within a mile of you he complained but itll help some

Sheltered in the thick folds of the Navajo she laughed and the sound
of it sent the blood galloping through Rowdy Vaughans body so that he
was almost warm He went and scraped the snow out of his saddle and
swung up feeling that after all there are worse things in the
world than being lost and hungry in a blizzard with a sweetvoiced
brighteyed little schoolmaam who can laugh like that

I dont want to have you think I may be a bold bad robberman he
said when they got going again My names Rowdy Vaughanfor which I
beg your pardon Mother named me Rowland never knowing Id get out here
and have her nice pretty name mutilated that way I wont say that my
behavior never suggested the change though Im from the Horseshoe
Bar over the line and if I have my way Ill be a Cross L man before
another day Then he waited expectantly

For fear you may think Im aa robberwoman she answered him
solemnlyhe felt sure her eyes twinkled if only he could have seen
themIm Jessie Conroy And if youre from over the line maybe you
know my brother Harry He was over there a year or two

Rowdy hunched his shoulderspresumably at the wind Harry Conroys
sister was she And he swore I may have met him he parried in a
tone youd never notice as being painstakingly careless I think I did
come to think of it

Miss Conroy seemed displeased and presently the cause was forthcoming
If youd ever met him she said youd hardly forget him
Rowdy mentally agreed profanely Hes the best rider in the whole
countryand the handsomest Hehes splendid And hes the only
brother Ive got Its a pity you never got acquainted with him

Yes lied Rowdy and thought a good deal in a very short time Harry
Conroys sister Well she wasnt to blame for that of course nor for
thinking her brother a white man I remember I did see him ride once
he observed He was a whirlwind all rightand he sure was handsome
too

Miss Conroy turned her face toward him and smiled her pleasure and
Rowdy hovered between heaven andanother place He was glad she
smiled and he was afraid of what that subject might discover for his
straightforward tongue in the way of pitfalls It would not be nice to
let her know what he really thought of her brother

This looks to me like a lane he said diplomatically We must be
getting somewhere dont you recognize any landmarks

Miss Conroy leaned forward and peered through the clouds of snow dust
Already the night was creeping down upon the land stealthily turning
the blank white of the blizzard into as blank a graywhich was as near
darkness as it could get because of the snow which fell and fell
and yet seemed never to find an abidingplace but danced and swirled
giddily in the wind as the cold froze it dry There would be no more
damp clinging masses that night it was sifting down like flour from a
giant sieve and of the supply there seemed no end

I dont know of any lanes around here she began dubiously unless
its

Vaughan looked sharply at her muffled figure and wondered why she
broke off so suddenly She was staring hard at the few faint traces of
landmarks and bundled in the redandyellow Navajo blanket with her
bright dark eyes she might easily have passed for a slim young squaw

Out ahead a dog began barking vaguely and Rowdy turned eagerly to
the sound Dixie scenting human habitation stepped out more briskly
through the snow and even Chub lifted an ear briefly to show he heard

It may not be any one you know Vaughan remarked and his voice showed
his longing but itll be shelter and a warm fireand supper Can you
appreciate such blessings Miss Conroy I can Ive been in the saddle
since sunrise and I was so sure Id strike the Cross L by dinnertime
that I didnt bring a bite to eat It was a sheepcamp where I stopped
and the grub didnt look good to me anywayIve called myself bad
names all the afternoon for being more dainty than sensible But its
all right now I guess



CHAPTER 2 Miss Conroy Refuses Shelter

The storm lifted suddenly as storms have a way of doing and a low
squat ranchhouse stood dimly revealed against the bleak expanse of
windtortured prairie Rowdy gave an exultant little whoop and made for
the gate leaned and swung it open and rode through dragging Chub after
him by main strength as usual When he turned to close the gate after
Miss Conroy he found her standing still in the lane

Come on in he called with a trace of impatience born of his
weariness and hunger

Thank you no Miss Conroys voice was as crisply cold as the wind
which fluttered the Navajo blanket around her face I much prefer the
blizzard


For a moment Rowdy found nothing to say he just stared Miss Conroy
shifted uneasily in the saddle

This is old Bill Browns place she explained reluctantly HeId
rather freeze than go in

Well I guess that wont be hard to do he retorted curtly if you
stay out much longer

The dog was growing hysterical over their presence and Bill Brown
himself came out to see what it was all about He could see two dim
figures at the gate

Hello he shouted Why dont yuh come on in What yuh standing there
chewing the rag for

Vaughan hesitated his eyes upon Miss Conroy

Go in she commanded imperiously quite as if he were a refractory
pupil Youre tired out and hungry Im neither Besides I know where
I am now I can find my way without any trouble Go in I tell you

But Rowdy stayed where he was with the gate creaking to and fro between
them Dixie circled till his back was to the wind I hope you dont
think youre going to mill around out here alone Rowdy said tartly

I can manage very well Im not lost now I tell you Rodways is only
three miles from here and I know the direction

Bill Brown waded out to them wondering what weighty discussion was
keeping them there in the cold Vaughan he passed by with the cursory
glance of a disinterested stranger and went on to where Miss Conroy
waited stubbornly in the lane

Oh its you he said grimly Well come in and thaw out I hope yuh
didnt think yuh wouldnt be welcome yuh knew better You got lost I
reckon Come on

Miss Conroy struck Badger sharply across the flank and disappeared into
the night When I ask shelter of you she flung back youll know
it

Rowdy started after and met Bill Brown squarely in the gate Bill eyed
him sharply Say young fellow howd you come by that packhorse he
demanded as Chub brushed past him

None of your damn business snapped Rowdy and drove the spurs into
Dixies ribs But Chub was a handicap at any time now when he was
tired there was no getting anything like speed out of him he clung to
his shuffling trot which was really no better than a walk After
five minutes spent alternately in spurring Dixie and yanking at Chubs
leadrope Rowdy grew frightened and took to shouting While they were
in the lane Miss Conroy must perforce ride straight ahead but the lane
would not last always As though with malicious intent the snow swooped
down again and the world became an unreal nightmare world wherein was
nothing save shifting blinding snowfloury and wind and bitter numbing
cold

Rowdy stood in his stirrups cupped his chilled fingers around his
numbed lips and sent a longdrawn Whoee shrilling weirdly into the
night

It seemed to him after long listening that from the right came faint
reply and he turned and rode recklessly swearing at Chub for
his slowness He called again and the answer though faint was
unmistakable He settled heavily into the saddletoo weak from sheer
relief to call again He had not known till then just how frightened he
had been and he was somewhat disconcerted at the discovery In a minute
the reaction passed and he shouted a loud hello

Hello came the voice of Miss Conroy tantalizingly calm and as
superior as the greeting of Central Were you looking for me Mr
Vaughan

She was close to himso close that she had not needed to raise her
voice perceptibly Rowdy rode up alongside remembering uncomfortably
his prolonged shouting

I sure was he admitted And then You rode off with my blanket on
He was very proud of his matteroffact tone

Oh Miss Conroy was almost deceived and a bit disappointed Ill
give it to you now and you can go backif you know the way

No hurry said Rowdy politely Ill go on and see if you can find a
place that looks good to you You seem pretty particular

Miss Conroy may have blushed in the shelter of the blanket I suppose
it did look strange to you she confessed but defiantly Bill Brown
is an enemy toHarry Hebecause he lost a horse or two out of a
field one time hehe actually accused Harry of taking them He lied
of course and nobody believed him nobody could believe a thing like
that about Harry It was perfectly absurd But he did his best to
hurt Harrys name and I would rather freeze than ask shelter of him
Wouldnt youin my place I mean

I always stand up for my friends evaded Rowdy And if I had a
brother

Of course youd be loyal approved Miss Conroy warmly But I didnt
want you to come on it isnt your quarrel And I know the way now You
neednt have come any farther

You forgot the blanket Rowdy reminded wickedly I think a lot of
that Navajo

You insisted upon my taking it she retorted and took refuge in
silence

For a long hour they plodded blindly Rowdy beat his hands often about
his body to start the blood and meditated yearnigly upon hot coffee
and the things he liked best to eat Also a good long pull at a
flask wouldnt be had either he thought And he hoped this little
schoolmaam knew where she was goingtruth to tell he doubted it

After a while it seemed that Miss Conroy doubted it also She took
to leaning forward and straining her eyes to see through the gray wall
before

There should be a gate here she said dubiously at last

It seems to me Rowdy ventured mildly if there were a gate it would
have some kind of a fence hitched to it wouldnt it

Miss Conroy was in no mood for facetiousness and refused to answer his
question I surely cant have made a mistake she observed uneasily

It would be a wonder if you didnt such a night as this he consoled
I wouldnt bank on traveling straight myself even if I knew the
countrywhich I dont And Ive been in more blizzards than Im years
old

Rodways place cant be far away she said brightening It may be
farther to the east shall we try that wayif you know which is east

Sure well try Its all we can do My packhorse is about all in from
the way he hangs back if we dont strike something pretty soon Ill
have to turn him loose

Oh dont do that she begged It would be too cruel Were sure to
reach Rodways very soon

More plodding through drifts high and drifts low more leaning from
saddles to search anxiously for trace of something besides snow and wind
and biting cold Then far to the right a yellow eye glowed briefly
when the storm paused to take breath Miss Conroy gave a glad little cry
and turned Badger sharply

Did you see It was the light from a window We were going the wrong
way Im sure that is Rodways

Rowdy thanked the Lord and followed her They came up against a fence
found a gate and passed through While they hurried toward it the
light winked welcome as they drew near some one stirred the fire and
sent sparks and rosehued smoke rushing up into the smother of snow
Rowdy watched them wistfully and wondered if there would be supper and
strong hot coffee He lifted Miss Conroy out of the saddle carried
her two long strides and deposited her upon the doorstep rapped
imperatively and when a voice replied lifted the latch and pushed her
in before him

For a minute they stood blinking just within the door The change
from numbing cold and darkness to the light of the overheated room was
stupefying

Then Miss Conroy went over and held her little gloved hands to the
heat of the stove but she did not take the chair which some one pushed
toward her She stood the blanket shrouding her face and her slim young
figure and looked about her curiously It was not Rodways house after
all She thought she knew what place it wasthe shack where Rodways
haybalers bached

From the first Rowdy did not like the look of thingsthough for
himself it did not matter he was used to such scenes It was the
presence of the girl which made him uncomfortable He unbuttoned his
coat that the warmth might reach his chilled body and frowned

Four men sat around a small dirty table evidently the arrivals had
interrupted an exciting game of sevenup A glance told Rowdy even
if his nose had not that the four round ribbed bottles had not been
nearly emptied without effect

Have one on the house the man nearest him cried and shoved a bottle
toward him

Involuntarily Rowdy reached for it Now that he was inside he realized
all at once how weary he was and cold and hungry Each abused muscle
and nerve seemed to have a distinct grievance against him His fingers
closed around the bottle before he remembered and dropped it He looked
up hoping Miss Conroy had not observed the action met her wide
questioning eyes and the blood flew guiltily to his cheeks

Thanks boysnot any for me he said and apologized to Miss Conroy
with his eyes

The man rose and confronted him unsteadily Dats a hell off a way You
too proud for drink weeth us You drink now By Gar I make you drink

Rowdys eyelids drooped which was a bad sign for those who knew him
Youre forgetting theres a lady present he reminded warningly

The man turned a brief contemptuous glance toward the stove You got
the damn queer way to talk I dont call no squaw no lady You drink
queeck now

Aw shut up Frenchy the man at his elbow abjured him He dont have
to drink if he dont want to

You keep the face close the other retorted majestically and cursed
loud and long and incoherently

Rowdy drew back his arm with a fist that meant trouble for somebody
but there were others before him who pinned the importunate host to the
table where he squirmed unavailingly

Rowdy buttoned up his coat the while he eyed the group disgustedly I
guess well drift he remarked You dont look good to me and thats
no dream

Aw stay and warm up the fourth man expostulated Yuh dont need t
mind Le Febre hes drunk

But Rowdy opened the door decisively and Miss Conroy her cheeks
like two stormbuffeted poppies followed him out with dignityalbeit
trailing a yard of redandyellow Navajo blanket behind her Rowdy
lifted her into the saddle tucked her feet carefully under the blanket
and said never a word

Mr Vaughan she began hesitatingly this is too bad you need not
have left II wasnt afraid

I know you werent conceded Rowdy But it was a hard formationfor
a woman Are there any more places on this flat marked Unavailable

Miss Conroy replied misanthropically that if there were they would be
sure to find them

They took up their weary wanderings again while the yellow eye of the
window winked after them They missed Rodways by a scant hundred yards
and didnt know it because the side of the house next them had no
lighted windows They traveled in a wide half circle and thought that
they were leaving a straight trail behind them More than once Rowdy was
urged by his aching arm to drop the leadrope and leave Chub to shift
by himself but habit was strong and his heart was soft Then he felt an
odd twitching at the leadrope as if Chub were minded to rebel against
their leadership Rowdy yanked him into remembrance of his duty and
wondered Bill Browns question came insistently to mind he wondered
the more

Two minutes and the leadrope was sawing against the small of his back
again Rowdy turned Dixies head and spoke for the first time in an
hour

My packhorse seems to have an idea about where he wants to go he
said I guess we might as well follow him as anybody he aint often
taken with a rush of brains to the head And we cant be any worse lost
than we are now can we

Miss Conroy said no dispiritedly and they swung about and followed
Chubs leadership apathetically It took Chub just five minutes to
demonstrate that he knew what he was about When he stopped it was with
his nose against a corral gate not content with that he whinnied and
a new exultant note was in the sound A deepvoiced dog bayed loudly
and a shrill yelp cut in and clamored for recognition

Miss Conroy gasped Its Lion and Skeesicks Were at Rodways Mr
Vaughan

Rowdy for the second time thanked the Lord But when he was stripping
the pack off Chubs back ten minutes later he was thinking many things
he would not have cared to say aloud It might be all right but it sure
was strange he told himself that Chub belonged here at Rodways when
Harry Conroy claimed that he was an Oregon horse Rowdy had thought his
account against Harry Conroy long enough but it looked now as though
another item must be added to the list He went in and ate his supper
thoughtfully and when he got into bed he did not fall asleep within two
minutes as he might be expected to do His last conscious thought was
not of stolen horses however It was And shes Harry Conroys sister
Now what do you think of that But all the same shes sure a nice
little schoolmaam



CHAPTER 3 Rowdy Hires a New Boss

Next morning after breakfast Mr Rodway followed Vaughan out to the
stable and repeated Bill Browns question

Id like to know where yuh got this horse he began with an
apologetic sort of determination in his tone He happens to belong to
me He was run off with a bunch three years ago and this is the first
trace anybody has ever got of em I see the brands been worked It was
a Roman fourthats my brand now it looks like a map of Texas but Id
swear to the horseraised him from a colt

Rowdy had expected something of the sort and he knew quite well what he
was going to do he had settled that the night before with the memory
of Miss Conroys eyes fresh in his mind

I got him in a deal across the line he said I was told he came from
east Oregon But last night when he piloted us straight to your corral
gate I guessed hed been here before Hes yours all right if you say
so

Uh course he aint worth such a pile uh money apologized Rodway but
the kids thought a heap of him Id rather locate some of the horses
that was with himor the man yuh got him of They was some mighty good
horses run out uh this country then but they was all out on the range
so we didnt miss em in time to do any good Do yu know who took em
across the line

No said Rowdy deliberately The man I got Chub from went north and
I heard he got killed I dont know of any other in the deal

Rodway grunted and Vaughan began vigorously brushing Dixies roughened
coat If you dont mind he said after a minute Id like to borrow
Chub to pack my bed over to the Cross L I can bring him back again

Why sure assented Rodway eagerly I hate to take him from yuh but
the kids

Oh thats all right interrupted Rowdy cheerfully Its all in the
game and I should a looked up his pedigree for I knew Anyway was
worth the price of him to have him along last night Wed have milled
around till daylight I guess only for him

Thats what agreed Rodway Jessies horse is one she brought from
home lately and he aint located yet I dunno as hed a piloted her
home Billythats what the kids named himwas born and raised here
yuh see Ill bet hes glad to get backand the kidsll be plumb wild

Rowdy did not answer there seemed nothing in particular to say and he
was wondering if he would see Miss Conroy before he left She had not
eaten breakfast with the others from their manner he judged that
no one expected her to He was not well informed upon the subject
of schoolmaams but he had a hazy impression that late rising was a
distinguishing characteristicand he did not know how late He
saddled leisurely and packed his bed for the last time upon Chub The
redandyellow Navajo blanket he folded tenderly with an unconscious
smile for the service it had done and laid it in its accustomed place
in the bed Then having no plausible excuse for going back to the
house he mounted and rode away into the brilliant white world watching
wistfully the house from the tail of his eye

She might have got up in time to see him off he thought discontentedly
but he supposed one cowpuncher more or less made little difference to
her Anyway he didnt know as he had any license to moon around her
She probably had a fellow she might even be engaged for all he knew
Andshe was Harry Conroys sister and from his experience with the
breed good looks didnt count for anything Harry was goodlooking and
he was a snake if ever there was one He had never expected to lie for
himbut he had done it all rightand because Harrys sister happened
to have nice eyes and a pretty little foot

He had half a mind to go back and tell Rodway all he knew about those
horses it was only a matter of time anyway till Harry Conroy overshot
the mark and got what was coming to him He sure didnt owe Harry
anything that he had need to shield him like he had done Still
Rodway would wonder why he hadnt told it at first and that little girl
believed in Harry and said he was splendid Humph He wondered if she
really meant that If she did

He squared his back to the houseand the memory of Miss Conroys
eyesand plodded across the field to the gate Now the sun was shining
and there was no possibility of getting lost The way to the Cross L lay
straight and plain before him

Rowdy rode leisurely up over the crest of a ridge beyond which lay the
home ranch of the Cross L Whether it was henceforth to be his home he
had yet to discoverthough there was reason for hoping that it would
be Even so venturesome a man as Rowdy Vaughan would scarce ride a long
hundred miles through unpeopled prairie in the tricky month of March
without some reason for expecting a welcome at the end of his journey
In this case a previous acquaintance with Wooden Shoes Mielke
foreman of the Cross L was Rowdys trumpcard Wooden Shoes whenever
chance had brought them together in the last two or three years was
ever urging Rowdy to come over and unroll his soogans in the Cross L
bedtent and promising the best string in the outfit to ridebesides
other things alluring to a cowpuncher So that when his relations with
the Horseshoe Bar became strained Rowdy remembered his friend of the
Cross L and the promises and had drifted south

Just now he hoped that Wooden Shoes would be home to greet him and
his eyes searched wishfully the huddle of loweaved cabins and the
assortment of sheds and corrals for the bulky form of the foreman But
no one seemed to be aboutexcept a bigbodied bandylegged individual
who appeared to be playfully chasing a big bright bay stallion inside
the large enclosure where stood the cabins

Rowdy watched them impersonally a glance proved that the man was not
Wooden Shoes and so he was not particularly interested in him or his
doings It did occur to him however that if the fellow wanted to catch
that brute he ought to have sense enough to get a horse No one but
a plumb idiot would mill around in that snow afoot He jogged down the
slope at a shuffling trot grinning tolerantly at the pantomime below

He of the bandylegs stopped evidently out of breath the stallion
stopped also snorting defiance Rowdy heard him plainly even at that
distance The horse arched his neck and watched the man warily ready
to be off at the first symptom of hostilitiesand Rowdy observed that a
short rope hung from his halter swaying as he moved

Bandylegs seemed to have an idea he turned and scuttled to the nearest
cabin returning with what seemed a basin of oats for he shook it
enticingly and edged cautiously toward the horse Rowdy could imagine
him coaxing with hypocritically endearing names such as Good old
boy and Steady now Billyor whatever the horses name might
be Rowdy chuckled to himself and hoped the horse saw through the
subterfuge

Perhaps the horse chuckled also at any rate he stood quite still
equally prepared to bounce away on the instant or to don the mask of
docility Bandylegs drew nearer and nearer shaking the basin briskly
like an old woman sifting meal The horse waited his nostrils quivering
hungrily at the smell of the oats and with an occasional low nicker

Bandylegs went on tiptoesor as nearly as he could in the snowthe
basin at arms length before The dainty flaring nostrils sniffed
tentatively dipped into the basin and snuffed the oats about
luxuriouslytill he felt a stealthy hand seize the dangling rope At
the touch he snorted protest and was off and away upsetting Bandylegs
and the basin ignominiously into a highpiled drift

Bandylegs sat up scraped the snow out of his collar and his ears and
swore It was then that Rowdy appeared like an angel of deliverance

Want that horse caught he yelled cheerfully

Bandylegs lifted up his voice and bellowed things I should not like to
repeat verbatim But Rowdy gathered that the man emphatically did want
that soandsoandthensome horse caught and that it couldnt be done
a blessed minute too soon Whereat Rowdy smiled anew with his face
discreetly turned away from Bandylegs and took down his rope and
widened the loop Also he turned Chub loose

The stallion evidently sensed what new danger threatened his stolen
freedom and circled the yard with high springy strides Rowdy circled
after saw his chance swirled the loop twice over his head and
hazarded a long throw

Rowdy knew it for pure good luck that it landed right but to this day
Bandylegs looks upon him as a Wonder with a ropeand Bandylegs would
insist upon the capital

Where shall I take him Rowdy asked coming up with his captive and
with nothing but his eyes to show how he was laughing inwardly

Bandylegs crawled from the drift still scraping snow from inside his
collar and gave many directions about going through a certain gate into
suchandsuch a corral from there into a stable and by seeming devious
ways into a minutely described stall

All right said Rowdy cutting short the last needless details I
guess I can find the trail and started off leading the stallion
Bandylegs followed and Chub observing the departure of Dixie ambled
faithfully in the rear

Much obliged conceded Bandylegs when the stallion was safely housed
and tied securely Where yuh headed for young man

Right here Rowdy told him calmly loosening Dixies cinch Im the
longlost top hand that the Cross Ls been watching the skyline for
lo these many moons ayearning for the privilege of handing me forty
plunks about twice as fast as Ive got em coming Wheres the boss

ErIm him confessed Bandylegs meekly and circled the two
dubiously I guess youve heard uh Eagle Creek SmithIm him The
Cross L belongs to me

Rowdy let out an explosive and showed a row of nice teeth Well I
aint hard to please he added I wont kick on that I guess I like
your looks tolerable well and Im willing to take yuh on for a boss If
yuh do your part I bet well get along fine His tone was banteringly
patronizing Anyway Ill try yuh for a spell You can put my name down
as Rowdy Vaughan lately canned from the Horseshoe Bar

What for ventured Bandylegsrather Eagle Creekstill circling
Rowdy dubiously

What for was I canned repeated Rowdy easily Being a modest youth I
hate t tell yuh But the old mans son and me we disagreed and one
of his eyes swelled some so did mine a little He stood head and
shoulders above Eagle Creek and he smiled down upon him engagingly
Eagle Creek capitulated before the smile

Well I aint got any sonsthat I know of he grinned So I guess
yuh can consider yourself a Cross L man till further notice

Why sure The teeth gleamed again briefly Thats what Ive been
telling you right along Wheres old Wooden Shoes Hes responsible for
me being here

Gone to Chinook Hell be back in a day or two Eagle Creek shifted
his feet awkwardly Sayhe glanced uneasily behind himyuh dont
want t let it get around that yuh sort ofhired mesee

Of course not Rowdy assured him I was only joshing If you dont
want me just tell me to hit the sod

You stay right where youre at commanded Eagle Creek with returned
confidence in himself and his authority Of a truth this selfassured
straightlimbed young man had rather dazed him Take your bed and
warbag up to the bunkhouse and make yourself t home till the boys get
back andsay whered yuh git that packhorse

The laugh went out of Rowdys tawny eyes The question hit a spot that
was becoming sore I borrowed him this morning from Mr Rodway he
said evenly Im to take him back today I stopped there last night

Oh Eagle Creek coughed apologetically and said no word while Rowdy
led Chub back to the cabin which he had pointed out as the bunkhouse
he stood by while Rowdy loosened the pack and dragged it inside

I guess you can get located here he said I aint workin moren
three or four men just now but theres quite a few uh the boys stopping
here the Cross Ls a regular hangout for cowpunchers Youre a little
early for the season but Ill see that yuh have something t dojust
t keep yuh out uh devilment

Rowdys brows unbent it would seem that Eagle Creek was capable of
joshing also Its up t you oldtimer he retorted Im strong
and willing and dont shy at anything but pitchforks

Eagle Creek grinned This aint no blamed cowhospital he gave as a
parting shot All the hay thats shoveled on this ranch neednt hurt
nobodys feelings With that he shut the door and left Rowdy to
acquaint himself with his new home



CHAPTER 4 Pink as Chappyrone

Rowdy was sprawled ungracefully upon somebodys bunkhe neither knew
nor cared whoseand he was snoring unmelodiously and not dreaming a
thing for when a cowpuncher has nothing in particular to do he
sleeps to atone for the weary hours when he must be very wideawake An
avalanche descended upon his unwarned middle and checked the rhythmic
ebb and flow of sound He squawked and came to life clawing viciously

Id like t know where the devil yuh come from a voice remarked
plaintively in a soft treble

Rowdy opened his eyes with a snap Pink by all thats good and bad
Get up off my diaphragm you little fiend

Pink absentmindedly kneaded Rowdys stomach with his knuckles and
immediately found himself in a far corner He came back dimpling
mischievously He looked much more an angel than a fiend for all his
Angora chaps and flamecolored scarf

Your bed and warbags on my bunk youre on Smokys and Dixies
makin himself to home in the corral By all them signs and tokens
I give a reckless guess youre here t stay a while That right He
prodded again at Rowdys ribs

It sure is Pink And if Id known you was holding out here Id a
come sooner maybe You sure look good to me you darned little cuss
Rowdy sat up and took a lightning inventory of the four or five other
fellows lounging about He must have slept pretty sound he thought not
to hear them come in

Pink read the look and bethought him of the necessary introductions
This is my sidekicker over the line thatyouve heard about till
youre plumb weary boys he announced musically His name is Rowdy
Vaughanbroncopeeler crap fiend and allround bad man He aint a
safe companion and yuh want t sleep with your sixguns cuddled under
your right ear and never on no account show him your backs Hes a
real wolf he is and the only reason I live t tell the tale is because
he respects m size Boys Im afraid for yuhbut I wish yuh well

Pink you need killing and Im tempted to live up to my rep grinned
Rowdy indulgently Read me the pedigree of your friends

Oh they aint no worsewhen yuh git used to em That longlegged
jasper with the faraway look in his eyes is the Silent Oneif he takes
a notion t you hell maybe tell yuh the name his mother calls him He
may have seen better days but heres hoping he wont see no worse He
once was a tenderfoot but hes convalescing

The Silent One nodded carelessly but with a quick measuring glance
that Rowdy liked

This unshaved savage is Smoky Hes harmless if yuh dont
mention socialism in his presence and if yuh do hell
downwiththetrustandlonglivethesonsuhtoil all hours uh the
night and keep folks awake Then him and the fellow that started him
off ll likely get chapped good and plenty Over theres Jim Ellis
and Bob Nevin theyve both turned a cow or two and Ive seen worse
specimens running around looseplenty of em That man hidin behind
the grinyou can see him if yuh look closeis Sunny Sam Yuh neednt
take no notice of him unless youre a mind to He wont carehes dead
gentle

Say he broke off howd you happen t stray onto this range anyhow
Yuh used t belong t the Horseshoe Bar so solid the assessor always t
yuh down on the personalproperty list

They wont pay taxes on me no more son Rowdys eyes dwelt fondly
upon Pinks cupidbow mouth and dimples He had never dreamed of finding
Pink here though when he came to think of it there was no reason why
he shouldnt

Pink was not like any one else He was slight and girlish to look at
But you mustnt trust appearances for Pink was all muscle strung on
steel wire according to the belief of those who tried to handle him
He had little white hands and feet that looked quite comfortable in
a number four boot and his hair was a tawny gold and curled in
distracting damp rings on his forehead His eyes were blue and
longlashed and beautiful and they looked at the world with baby
innocencewhereas a more sophisticated little devil never jangled spurs
at his heels He was everything but insipid and men liked himunless
he chose to dislike them when they thought of him with grating teeth
To find him bullying the Cross L boys brought a warmth to Rowdys heart

Pink made a cigarette and then offered Rowdy his tobaccosack and
asked questions about the Cypress Hills country How was this girland
was that one married yetand did the other still grieve for him As a
matter of fact he had yet to see the girl who could quicken his pulse
a single beat and for that reason it sometimes pleased him to affect
susceptibility beyond that of other men

It was after dinner when he and Rowdy went humming down to the stables
gossiping like a couple of old women over a back fence

I see youve got Conroys Chub yet Pink observed carelessly

Oh for Heavens sake let up on that cayuse Rowdy cried petulantly
I wish Id never got sight of the little buzzardhead Ive had him
crammed down my throat the last day or two till its getting plumb
monotonous Pink that cayuse never saw Oregon He was raised right on
this flat and he belongs to old Rodway Ive got to lead him back there
and turn him over today

Pink took three puffs at his cigarette and lifted his long lashes to
Rowdys gloomfilled face Stole he asked briefly

Stole Rowdy repeated disgustedly So was the whole blame bunch as
near as I can make out

We might a knowed it We might a guessed Harry Conroy wouldnt have
a straight title to anything if he could make it crooked I bet he never
finished paying back that money yuh lent himout uh the kindness uh
your heart Did he Pink leaned against the corral fence and kicked
meditatively at a snowcovered rock

He did not m son Chubs all I ever got out uh the dealand
I havent even got him I borrowed him from Rodway to pack my bed
overborrowed the blame little runty cayuse that cost me sixtyfour
hardearned dollars thats what Harry borrowed of me And every blame
gazabo on the flat wanted to know what I was doing with him

I can tell yuh where t find Conroy Rowdy Hes working for an
outfit down on the river Id sure fix him for this Yuh got plenty of
evidence you can send him up like a charm It was different when he cut
your latigo strap in that roughriding contest yuh couldnt prove it on
him But thiswhy man its a cinch

I havent lost Harry Conroy so I aint looking for him just now
growled Rowdy So long as he keeps out uh reach I wont ask no more of
him And Pink I wish youd keep this quietabout him having Chub I
told Rodway I couldnt put him next to the fellow that brought that
bunch across the line I told him the fellow went north and got killed
He did go northfifty miles or so and hed ought to been killed if he
wasnt Let it go that way Pink

Pink looked like a cherubfaced child when he has been told theres
no Santa Claus Sure if yuh say so he stammered dubiously He eyed
Rowdy reproachfully and then looked away to the horizon He kicked
the rock out of place and then poked it painstakingly back with his
toeand from the look of him he did not know there was a rock there at
all

Howd yuh happen to run across Rodway he asked guilelessly

I stopped there last night I got to milling around in that storm and
ran across the schoolmaam that boards at Rodways She was plumb lost
too so we dubbed around together for a while and finally got inside
Rodways field Then Chub come alive and piloted us to the house This
morning Rodway claimed himsays the brand has been worked from a Roman
four Oh its all straight goods he added hastily Old Eagle Creek
here knew him too

But Pink was not thinking of Chub He hunched his chapbelt higher
and spat viciously into the snow I knowed it he declared with
melancholy triumph Its schoolmaamitis thats gave yuh softening uh
the vitals and not no Christian charity play How comes it youre took
that way all unbeknown t your friends Yuh never used t bother about
no female girls Its a cinch youre wise that shes Harrys sister and
I admit shes a swell looker But sos he and I should think Rowdy
youd had about enough uh that brand uh snake

Theres nothing so snaky about her that I could see defended Rowdy
He did not particularly relish having his own mental argument against
Miss Conroy thrown back at him from another She seemed to be all
right and if youd seen how plucky she was in that blizzard

Well I never heard anybody stand up and call Harry whitelivered when
yuh come t that Pink cut in tartly Anyway youre a blame fool If
she was a little whitewinged angel yuh wouldnt stand no kind uh show
and I tell yuh why Shes got a little tin god that she says prayers to
regular

Thats Harry And wouldnt he be the fine brotherinlaw He could
borrow all your wages offn yuh and when yuh went t make a pretty
ride hed up and cut your latigo and give yuh a fall And he could
work stolen horses off onto yuhand yuh wouldnt give a damn cause
Jessie wears a number two shoe

You must have done some rimrock riding after her yourself jeered
Rowdy

And has got shiny brown eyes just like Harrys

Theyre not laughed Rowdy halfangrily If you say that again
Pink Ill stick your head in a snowbank Her eyes are all right They
sure look good to me

Youve sure got em mourned Pink Yuh need t be closeherded by
your friends and thats no dream You wait till toward evening before
yuh take that horse back Im going along t chappyrone yuh Rowdy Yuh
aint safe running loose any more

Rowdy cursed him companionably and told him to go along if he wanted
to and to look out he didnt throw up his own hands and Pink grumbled
and swore and did go along But when they got there Miss Conroy greeted
him like a very good friend which sent Rowdy sulky and kept him so all
the evening It seemed to him that Pink was playing a double game and
when they started home he told him so

But Pink turned in his saddle and smiled so that his dimples showed
plainly in the moonlight Chappyrones that set in a corner and look
wise are the rankest kind uh fakes he explained When she was talking
to me she was letting you alonesee

Rowdy accepted the explanation silently and stored it away in his
memory After that by riding craftily and by threats and by much
vituperation he managed to reach Rodways unchapperoned at least three
times out of fivewhich was doing remarkably well when one considers
Pink



CHAPTER 5 At Home at Cross L

In two days Rowdy was quite at home with the Cross L In a month he
found himself transplanted from the smokeladen air of the bunkhouse
and set off from the world in a line camp with nothing to do but patrol
the boggy banks of Milk River where it was still unfenced and unclaimed
by small farmers The only mitigation of his exile so far as he could
see lay in the fact that he had Pink and the Silent One for companions

It developed that when he would speak to the Silent One he must say
Jim or wait long for a reply Also the Silent One was not always
silent and he was quick to observe the weak points in those around him
and keen at repartee When it pleased him so to do he could handle the
English language in a way that was perfectly amazingand not always
intelligible to the unschooled At such times Pink frankly made no
attempt to understand him Rowdy having been hustled through grammar
school and twothirds through high school before he ran away from a
brand new stepmother rather enjoyed the outbreaks and Pinks consequent
disgust

Not one of them loved particularly the line camp and Rowdy least of
all since it put an extra ten miles between Miss Conroy and himself
Rowdy had got to that point where his mind dwelt much upon matters
domestic and he made many secret calculations on the cost of
housekeeping for two More than that he put himself upon a rigid
allowance for pocketmoneyan allowance barely sufficient to keep
him in tobacco and papers All this without consulting Miss Conroys
wisheswhich only goes to show that Rowdy Vaughan was a born optimist

The Silent One complained that he could not keep supplied with
readingmatter and Pink bewailed the monotony of inaction For beyond
watching the river to keep the cattle from miring in the mud lately
released from frost grip there was nothing to do

According to the calendar spring was well upon them and the prairies
would soon be flaunting new dresses of green The calendar however had
neglected to record the rainless heat of the summer gone before or
the searing winds that burned the grass brown as it grew or the winter
which forgot its part and permitted prairiedogs to chipchipchip above
ground in January when they should be sleeping decently in their cellar
homes

Apart from the brief storm which Rowdy had brought with him there had
been no snow worth considering Always the chill winds shaved the barren
land from the north or veered unexpectedly and blew dry warmth from
the southwest but never the snow for which the land yearned Wind and
bright sunlight and more wind and hypocritical drifting clouds and
more sun lean cattle walking walking uphill and down coulee nose to
the dry ground snipping the stray tufts where should be a woolly carpet
of sweet ripened grasses eating wildrose bushes level with the sod
and wishing there was only an abundance even of them drifting uneasily
from hilltop to farther hilltop hungerdriven and gaunt where should
be sleek content When they sought to continue their quest beyond the
river and the weaker bogged at its muddy edge Rowdy and Pink and
the Silent One would ride out and with their ropes drag them back
ignominiously to solid ground and the very doubtful joy of living

May Day found the grassland brown and lifeless with a chill wind
blowing over it The cattle wandered as before except that knockkneed
little calves trailed beside their lean mothers and clamored for full
stomachs

The Cross L cattle bore the brunt of the range famine because Eagle
Creek Smith was a stockman of the old school His cattle must live on
the open range because they always had done so Other men bought or
leased large tracts of grassland and fenced them for just such an
emergency but not he It is true that he had two or three large fields
as Miss Conroy had told Rowdy but it was his boast that all the hay he
raised was eaten by his saddlehorses and that all the fields he owned
were used solely for horse pastures The open range was the place for
cattle and no Cross L critter ever fed inside a wire fence

Through the dry summer before when other men read the ominous signs
and hurriedly leased pastureland and cut down their herds to what the
fields would feed Eagle Creek went calmly on as he had done always
He shipped what beef was fitand that of a truth was not muchand
settled down for the winter trusting to winter snows and spring rains
to refill the longdry lakes and waterholes and coat the levels anew
with grass

But the winter snows had failed to appear and with the spring came
no rain April showers became a hideously ironical joke at natures
expense Always the wind blew and sometimes great flocks of clouds
would drift superciliously up from the far skyline play with mens
hopes and sail disdainfully on to some more favored land

It is all very well for a man to cling stubbornly to precedent but if
he clings long enough there comes a time when to cling becomes akin to
crime Eagle Creek Smith still stubbornly held that rangecattle should
be kept to the range He waited until May was fast merging to June
watching from sheer habit for the spring transformation of brown
prairies into green When it did not come and only the coulee sides and
bottoms showed green among the brown he accepted ruefully the unusual
conditions which nature had thrust upon him and started Wooden Shoes
out with the wagons on the horse roundup which is a preliminary to the
roundup proper as every one knows



CHAPTER 6 A Shot From the Dark

I call that a bad job well done Pink remarked after a long silence
as he gave over trying to catch a fish in the muddy Milk River

What Rowdy still prone to daydreams of matters domestic came back
reluctantly to reality and inspected his bait

Oh come alive I mean the horse roundup How were going to keep that
bunch uh skeletons under us all summer is a guessing contest for fair
Wooden Shoes has got t give me about forty instead of a dozen if
he wants me t hit er up on circle the way Im used to I bet their
backbonesll wear clean up through our saddles

Oh I guess not said Rowdy calmly They aint so thinand theyll
pick up flesh Theres some mighty good ones in the bunch too I hope
Wooden Shoes dont forget to give me the first pick Theres one I got
my eye onthat blue roan Anyway I guess you can wiggle along with
less than forty

Pink shook his head thoughtfully and sighed Pink loved good mounts and
the outlook did not please him The roundup had camped for the last
time on the river within easy riding distance of Camas The next days
drive would bring them to the home ranch where Eagle Creek was fuming
over the lateness of the season the condition of the range and the
June rains which had thus far failed even to moisten decently the
grassroots

Lets ride over to Camas all the other fellows have gone Pink
proposed listlessly drawing in his line

Rowdy as listlessly consented Camas as a town was neither interesting
nor important but when one has spent three long weeks communing with
nature in her sulkiest and most unamiable mood even a town without a
railroad to its name may serve to relieve the monotony of living

The sun was piling gorgeous masses of purple and crimson clouds high
about him cuddling his fat cheeks against their soft folds till a
Midas he turned them to gold at the touch Those farther away
gloomed jealously at the favoritism of their lord and huddled closer
togetherthe purple for rage perhaps and the crimson for shame

Pinks face was tinged daintily with the glow and even Rowdys lean
brown features were for the moment glorified They rode knee to knee
silently thinking each his own thoughts the while they watched the
sunset with eyes grown familiar with its barbaric splendor but never
indifferent

Soon the west held none but the deeper tints and the shadows climbed
with the stealthy tread of trailing Indians from the valley chasing
the afterglow to the very hilltops where it stood a moment at bay
and then surrendered meekly to the dusk A meadowlark nearby cut the
silence into haunting ripples of melody stopped affrighted at their
coming and flew off into the dull glow of the west his little body
showed black against a crimson cloud Out across the river a lone coyote
yapped sharply then trailed off into the weird plaint of his kind

Brotherinlaws in town today Bob Nevin saw him Pink remarked
when the coyote ceased wailing and held his peace

Who Rowdy only halfheard

Bob Nevin repeated Pink naively

Dont get funny Who did Bob see

Brotherinlaw Yours not mine Jessies tin god If hes there yet
I bid for an invite to the swatfest Or maybea horrible possibility
forced itself upon Pinkmaybe youll kill the fattest maverick and
fall on his neck

The mavericks Rowdys brows were rather pinched together but his
tone told nothing

Naw Harry Conroys a fellows liable to do most any fool thing when
hes got schoolmaamitis

That so

Pink snorted The possibility had grown to black certainty in his mind
He became suddenly furious

Lord I hope some kind friendll lead me out an knock me in the head
if ever I get locoed over any darned girl

Same here agreed Rowdy unmoved

Then your days are sure numbered in words uh one syllable oldtimer
snapped Pink

Rowdy leaned and patted him caressingly upon the shouldera form of
irony which Pink detested Dont get excited sonny he soothed Did
you fetch your gun

I sure did Pink drew a long breath of relief Yuh neednt think Im
going t take chances on being no human colander Ive packed a gun for
Harry Conroy ever since that roughriding contest uh yourn Yuh mind
the way I took him under the ear with a rock Hes been makin wartalk
behind m back ever since Did I bring m gun Well I guess yes He
dimpled distractingly

All the same itll suit me not to run up against him said Rowdy
quite frankly He knew Pink would understand Then he lifted his coat
suggestively to show the weapon concealed beneath and smiled

Different here Yuh did have sense enough t be readyand if yuh see
him and dont forget hes got a sister with a number two foot damned
if I dont fix yuh both aplenty He settled his hat more firmly over
his curls and eyed Rowdy anxiously from under his lashes

Rowdy caught the action and the look from the tail of his eye and
grinned at his horses ears Pink in warlike mood always made him think
of a fouryearold child playing pirate with the difference that Pink
was always in deadly earnest and would fight like a fiend

For more reasons than one he hoped they would not meet Harry Conroy
Jessie was still in ignorance of his real attitude toward her brother
and Rowdy wanted nothing more than to keep her so The trouble was that
he was quite certain to forget everything but his grievances if ever he
came face to face with Harry Also Pink would always fight quicker for
his friends than for himself and he felt very tender toward Pink So
he hoped fervently that Harry Conroy had already ridden back whence he
came and there would be no unpleasantness

Four or five Cross L horses stood meekly before the Come Again Saloon
so Rowdy and Pink added theirs to the gathering and went in The Silent
One looked up from his place at a round table in a far corner and
beckoned

We need another hand here he said when they went over to him These
gentlemen are worried because they might be taken into high society some
day and they would be placed in a very embarrassing position through
their ignorance of bridgewhist I have very magnanimously consented to
teach them the rudiments

Bob Nevin looked up and then lowered an eyelid cautiously Hes a
liar He offered to learn us how to play it we bet him the drinks he
didnt savvy the game himself Set down Pink and Ill have you for my
pretty pardner

The Silent One shuffled the cards thoughtfully To make it seem like
bonafide bridge he began we should have everybody playing

Aw the common ordinary brand is good enough protested Bob I aint
in on any trimmings

The Silent One smiled ever so slightly We should have prizesor
favors Is there a store in town where one could buy something
suitable

They got codfish up here I smelt it suggested Jim Ellis Him the
Silent One ignored

What do you say boys to a real high society whistparty Ill invite
the crowd and be the hostess And Ill serve punch

Come on fellows and have one with me called a strange voice near
the door

Meetings adjourned cried Jim Ellis and got up to accept the
invitation and range along the bar with the rest He had not been
particularly interested in bridgewhist anyway

The others remained seated and the bartender called across to know what
they would have Pink cut the cards very carefully and did not look up
Rowdy thrust both hands in his pockets and turned his square shoulder
to the bar He did not need to lookhe knew that voice with its shoddy
heartiness

Men began to observe his attitude and looked at one another When one
is asked to drink with another he must comply or decline graciously if
he would not give a direct insult

Harry Conroy took three long steps and laid a hand on Rowdys
shouldera hand which Rowdy shook off as though it burned Say
stranger are you too hightoned t drink with a common cowpuncher he
demanded sharply

Rowdy halfturned toward him No sir But Ill be mighty thirsty
before I drink with you His voice was even but it cut

The room stilled on the instant it was as if every man of them had
turned to lay figures Harry Conroy had winced at sight of Rowdys
facemen saw that and some of them wondered Pink leaned back in
his chair every nerve tightened for the next move and waited It
was Harryhandsome sneering a certain swaggering defiance in his
posewho first spoke

Oh its you is it I havent saw yuh for some time Hows
broncofighting Gone up against any more contests He laughed
mockinglywith mouth and eyes maddeningly like Jessies in teasing
mood

Rowdy could have killed him for the resemblance alone His lids drooped
sleepily over eyes that glittered Harry saw the sign read it for
danger but he laughed again

Yuh ought to have seen this broncopeeler pull leather boys he
jeered recklessly I like to a died He got piled up the slickest I
ever saw and there was some feebleminded Canucks had money up on him
too He wont drink with me cause I got off with the purse Hes got
a grouchand I dont know as I blame him he did get let down pretty
hard for a fact

Maybe he did pull leatherbut he didnt cut none like you did you
damn skunk It was PinkPink with big longlashed eyes purple with
rage and with a deadwhite streak around his mouth and a gun in his
hand

Harry wheeled toward him and if a new light of fear crept into his
eyes his lips belied it in a sneer Two of a kind he laughed So
thats the story yuh brought over here is it Hell of a lot uh good
itll do yuh

Something in Pinks face warned Rowdy Harrys face turned watchfully
from one to the other Evidently he considered Pink the more uncertain
of the two and he was quite justified in so thinking Pink was only
waiting for a cue before using his gun and when Pink once began there
was no telling where or when he would leave off

While Harry stood uncertain Rowdys fist suddenly spatted against his
cheek with considerable force He tumbled a cursing heap against the
footrail of the bar scrambled up like a cata particularly vicious
catand came at Rowdy murderously The Come Again would shortly have
been filled with the pungent haze of burned powder only that the
bartender was a manofaction He hated brawls and it did not matter
to him how just might be the quarrel he slapped the gaping barrels of
a sawedoff shotgun across the barand from the look of it one might
imagine many disagreeable things

Drop it Cut it out he bellowed Yuh aint going t make no
slaughterpen out uh this joint I tell yuh Put up them guns or else
take em outside If you fellers are hellbent on smokin each other up
theys all kinds uh room outdoors Git Vamose Hike

Conroy wheeled and walked straightbacked and venomous to the door
Come on out if yuh aint scared he sneered Its two agin one
and then some by the look uh things But Ill take yuh singly or in
bunches Im ready for the whole damn Cross L bunch uh coyotes Come
on you whitelivered

Rowdy rushed for him with Pink and the Silent One at his heels He had
forgotten that Harry Conroy ever had a sister of any sort whatsoever
All he knew was that Harry had done him much wrong of the sort which
comes near to being unforgivable and that he had sneered insults that
no man may overlook All he thought of was to get his hands on him

Outside the dusky stillness made all sounds seem out of place the
faint starlight made all objects black and unfamiliar Rowdy stopped
just off the threshold blinking at the darkness which held his enemy
It was strange that he did not find him at his elbow he thoughtand
a suspicion came to him that Harry was lying in wait it would be like
him He stepped out of the yellow glare from a window and stood in
more friendly shade Behind him on the doorstep stood the other two
blinking as he had done

A form which he did not recognize rushed up out of the darkness and
confronted the three belligerently Youre adisturbin the peace
he yelled We dont stand for nothing like that in Camas Youre my
prisonersall uh yuh The edict seemed to include even the bartender
peering over the shoulder of Bob Nevin who struggled with several
others for immediate passage through the doorway

I guess not pardner retorted Pink facing him as defiantly as though
the marshal were not twice his size

The marshal lunged for him but the Silent One reaching a long arm from
the doorstep rapped him smartly on the head with his gun The marshal
squawked and went down in a formless heap

Come on boys said the Silent One coolly I think wed better go
Your friend seems to have vanished in thin air

Rowdy grumbling mightily over what looked unpleasantly like retreat
was pushed toward his horse and mounted under protest Likewise Pink
who was for staying and cleaning up the whole town But the Silent One
was firm and there was that in his manner which compelled obedience

Harry Conroy might have been an opticaland auralillusion for all
the trace there was of him But when the three rode out into the little
street a bullet pinged close to Rowdys left ear and the red bark of a
revolver spat viciously from a black shadow beside the Come Again

Rowdy and the two turned and rode back shooting blindly at the place
but the shadow yawned silently before them and gave no sign Then the
Silent One observing that the marshal was getting upon a pair of very
unsteady legs again assumed the leadership and fairly forced Rowdy and
Pink into the homeward trail



CHAPTER 7 Rowdy in a Tough Place

Rowdy with nice calculation met Miss Conroy just as she had left
the schoolhouse and noted with much satisfaction that she was riding
alone Miss Conroy if she had been at all observant must have seen the
light of some fixed purpose shining in his eyes for Rowdy was resolved
to make her a partner in his dreams of matters domestic And of a
truth his easy assurance was the thinnest of cloaks to hide his inner
agitation

The roundup just got in yesterday afternoon he told her as he swung
into the trail beside her Were going to start out again tomorrow so
this is about the only chance Ill have to see you for a while

I knew the roundup must be in said Miss Conroy calmly I heard that
you were in Camas a night or two ago

Inwardly Rowdy dodged We camped close to Camas he conceded
guardedly A lot of us fellows rode into town

Yes so Harry told me she said He came over to see me yesterday
He is going to leavehas already in fact He has had a fine position
offered him by the Indian agent at Belknap The agent used to be
a friend of fathers She looked at Rowdy sidelong and then went
straight at what was in the minds of both

Im sorry to hear Mr Vaughan that you are on bad terms with Harry
What was the trouble She turned her head and smiled at himbut the
smile did not bring his lips to answer it was unpleasantly like the way
Harry smiled when he had some deviltry in mind

Rowdy scented trouble and parried Men cant always get along agreeably
together

And you disagree with a man rather emphatically I should judge Harry
said you knocked him down Politeness ruled her voice but cheeks and
eyes were aflame

I did And of course he told you how he took a shot at me from a dark
corner outside Rowdys eyes it would seem had kindled from the fire
in hers

No he didntbut Iyou struck him first

Hitting a man with your fist is one thing said Rowdy with decision
Shooting at him from ambush is another

Harry shouldnt have done that she admitted with dignity But why
wouldnt you take a drink with him Not that I approve of drinkingI
wish Harry wouldnt do such thingsbut he said it was an insult the way
you refused

Jessie

Miss Conroy please

Jessiehe repeated the name stubbornlyI think wed better drop
that subject You dont understand the case and anyway I didnt come
here to discuss Harry Our trouble is long standing and if I insulted
him you ought to know I had a reason I never came whining to you about
him and it dont speak well for him that he hotfooted over to you with
his version I suppose hed heard about meergoing to see you and
wanted to queer me I hope youll take my word for it Jessie that Ive
never harmed him all the trouble hes made for himself one way and
another

But what I came over for today concerns just you and me I wanted
to tell you thatto ask you if youll marry me I might put it more
artistic Jessie but thats what I mean andI mean all the things
Id like to say and cant He stopped and smiled at her wistfully
whimsical Ive been three weeks getting my feelings into proper words
little girl and coming over here I had a speech thought out that
sure done justice to my subject But all I can remember of it is just
thatthat I want you for always

Miss Conroy looked away from him but he could see a deeper tint of red
in her cheek It seemed a long time before she said anything Then
But youve forgotten about Harry Hes my brother and hed beeryou
wouldnt want him relatedto you

Harry Well I pass him up Ive got a pretty long account against him
but Ill cross it off It wont be hard to dofor you Ive thought of
all that and a man can forgive a whole lot in the brother of the woman
he loves He leaned toward her and added honestly I cant promise you
Ill ever get to like him Jessie but Ill keep my hands off him and
Ill treat him civil and when you consider all hes done thats quite
a largesized contract

Miss Conroy became much interested in the ears of her horse

The only thing to decide is whether you like me enough If you do
well sure be happy Never mind Harry

Youre very generous she flared telling me to never mind Harry
And Harrys my own brother and the only near relative Ive got I know
hesimpulsive and quicktempered perhaps But he needs me all the
more Do you think Ill turn against him even for you

That even may have been a slip but it heartened Rowdy immensely
I dont ask you to he told her gently I only want you to not turn
against me

I do wish you two would be sensible and stop quarreling She glanced
at him briefly

Im willing to cut it outI told you that I cant answer for him
though Rowdy sighed wishing Harry Conroy in Australia or some place
equally remote

Miss Conroy suddenly resolved to be strictly just and when a young
woman sets about being deliberately just the Lord pity him whom she
judges

Before I answer you I must know just what all this is about she said
firmly I want to hear both sides Im sure Harry wouldnt do anything
mean Do you think he would

Rowdy was dissentingly silent

Do you really in your heart believe that Harry wouldknowinglybe
guilty of anything mean Her eyes plainly told the answer she wanted to
hear

Rowdy looked into them hesitated and clung tenaciously to his
convictions Yes I do and I know Harry pretty well Jessie His face
showed how much he hated to say it

Im afraid you are very prejudiced she sighed But go on tell me
just what you have against Harry Im sure it can all be explained away
only I must hear what it is

Rowdy regarded her puzzled How he was to comply he did not know It
would be simply brutal to tell her He would feel like a hangman And
she believed so in Harry she wouldnt listen even if she did he
thought bitterly she would hate him for destroying her faith A womans
justiceah me

Dont you see youre putting me in a mighty hard position girlie he
protested Youre a heap better off not to know Hes your brother I
wish youd take my word that Ill drop the whole thing right where it
is Harrys had all the best of it so far let it stand that way

Her eyes met his coldly Are you afraid to let me judge between you
What did he do Darent you tell

Rowdys lids drooped ominously If you call that a dare he said
grimly Ill tell you fast enough I was a friend to him when he
needed one mighty bad I helped him when he was dead broke and out uh
work I kept him going all winterand to show his gratitude he gave
me the doublecross in more ways than one I wont go into details He
decided that he simply could not tell her bluntly that Harry had worked
off stolen horses on him and worse

Ohyou wont go into details Scorn filled eyes and voice Are
they so trivial then You tell me what you did for Harryplaying Good
Samaritan Harry let me tell you has property of his own I cant see
why he should ever be in need of charity Youre like all the rest you
hint things against himbut I believe its just jealousy You cant
come out honestly and tell me a single instance where he has harmed you
or done anything worse than other highspirited young men

It wouldnt do any good to tell you he retorted You think hes just
lacking wings to be an angel I hope to God youll always be able to
think so Im sure I dont want to jar your faith

I must say your actions dont bear out your words Youve just been
trying to turn me against him

I havent Ive been trying to convince you that I want you anyway
and Harry neednt come between us

In other words youre willing to overlook my being Harrys sister I
appreciate your generosity Im sure She did not look however as if
she meant that

I didnt mean that

Then you wont overlook it How very unfortunate Because I cant help
the relationship

Would you if you could he asked rashly

Certainly not

Im afraid were getting off the trail he amended tactfully I asked
you a while back if youd marry me

And I said I must hear both sides of your trouble with Harry before I
could answer

Whats the use Youd take his part anyway

Not if I found he was guilty of all youinsinuate I should be
perfectly just She really believed that

Cant you tell me yes or no anyway Dont let him come between us

I cant help it Wed never agree or be happy Hed keep on coming
between us whether we meant him to or not she said dispiritedly

Thats a cinch Rowdy muttered thinking of Harrys troublebreeding
talents

Then theres no more to be said Until you and Harry settle your
difficulties amicably or I am convinced that hes in the wrong well
just be friends Mr Vaughan Good afternoon She rode into the Rodway
yard feeling very just and virtuous no doubt But she left Rowdy
with some rather unpleasant thoughts and with a sentiment toward her
precious brother which was not far from manslaughter



CHAPTER 8 Pink in a Threatening Mood

Eagle Creek Smith had at last reached the point where he must face new
conditions and change established customs He could no longer ignore
the barrenness of the range or close his eyes to the grim fact that
his cattle were facing starvationand that in June when they should be
taking on flesh

When he finally did confess to himself that things couldnt go on like
that others had been before him in leasing and buying land until only
the dry benches were left to him and his hungry herds

But Eagle Creek was a man of resource When the roundup pulled in and
Wooden Shoes reported to him the general state of the cattle and told
of the waterholes newly fenced and of creek bottoms gobbled by men more
farseeing than he Eagle Creek took twentyfour hours to adjust himself
to the situation and to meet the crisis before him His own land as
compared to his twenty thousand cattle was too pitifully inadequate for
a second thought

He must look elsewhere for the correct answer to his problem

When Rowdy rode apathetically up to the stable Pink came out of the
bunkhouse to meet him big with news Oh doctor Were up against it
aplenty now he greeted with his dimples at their deepest

Huh grunted Rowdy crossly Whats hurting you Pink

Forecasting the future Pink retorted Eagle Creek has come alive
and has wised up sudden to the fact that this aint going t be any
Noahs flood brand uh summer and that his cattle look like the tailings
of a washboard factory Hes got busyand were sure going to Were
due t hit the grit out uh here in the first beams uh rosy morn and do
a record stunt at gathering cattle

Well we were going to anyhow Rowdy cut in

But thats only the prelude oldtimer Weve got t take em across
country to the Belknap reservation Eagle Creek went t town and
telegraphed and got the refusal of it for pasturage he aint so
slow oncet he gets started But if youve ever rode over them driedup
benches you savvy the merry party well be when we git there Ive saw
jackrabbits packing their lunch along over there

BelknapRowdy dropped his saddle spitefully to the groundis where
our friend Conroy has just gone to fill a splendid position

Pink thoughtfully blew the ashes from his cigarette Harry Conroy would
fill one position fine So one uh these days Ill offer it to him I
dont know anybody thatd look nicer in a coffin than that jasperand
if hes gone t Belknap thats likely the position hell fill all
right

Rowdy said nothing but his very silence told Pink much

Howd yuh make out with Jessie Pink asked frankly though he was not
supposed to know where Rowdy had been

Rowdy knew from experience that it was useless trying to keep anything
from Pink that Pink wanted to know besides there was a certain comfort
in telling his troubles to so stanch a friend Harry got his work in
there too he said bitterly He beat me to her and queered me for
good by the looks

Huh said Pink I wouldnt waste much time worrying over her if
shes that easy turned

Shes all right defended Rowdy quickly I dont know as I blame her
she takes the stand any sister would take She wants to know all about
the troublehear both sides she said so she could judge which was to
blame I guess shes got her heart set on being peacemaker I know one
thing shelikes me all right

I dont see how he queered yuh any then puzzled Pink She sure
couldnt take his part after youd told her all he done

Rowdy turned on him savagely You little fool do you think I told her
Right theres the trouble He told his story and when she asked for
mine I couldnt say anything Shes his sister

Youdidnttell Pink leaned against the stable and stared Rowdy
Vaughan theres times when even your friend cant disguise the fact
that yuh act plumb batty Yuh let Harry do yuh dirt that any other mand
a killed him on bare suspicion uh doing and yuh never told her when
she asked yuh to How yuh lent him money and let him steal some right
out uh your pocket

I couldnt prove that Rowdy objected

And yuh never told her about his cutting your latigo

Oh cut it out Rowdy glowered down at him I guess I dont need to
be reminded of all those things But are they the things a man can tell
a girl about her brother Pink youre about as unfeeling a little devil
as I ever run across Maybe youd have told her but I couldnt So its
all off

He turned away and stared unseeingly at the rim of hills that hid the
place where she lived She seemed very far away from him just thenand
very very desirable He thought then that he had never before realized
just how much he cared

You can jest bet Id a told her gritted Pink watching furtively
Rowdys averted face She aint goin t be bowed down by no load of
ignorance much longer either If she dont get Harry Conroys pedigree
straight out without the varnish itll be because I aint next to all
his past

But Rowdy glooming among the debris of certain pet aircastles neither
heard nor wanted to hear Pinks wrathful mutterings As a matter of
fact it was not till Pink clattered out of the yard on Mascot that he
remembered where he was Even then it did not occur to him to wonder
where Pink was going



CHAPTER 9 Moving the Herd

Four thousand weary cattle crawled up the long ridge which divides Chin
Coulee from Quitter Creek Pink riding point opposite the Silent One
twisted round in his saddle and looked back at the slowmoving river of
horns and backs veiled in a gray dustcloud Down the line at intervals
rode the others humped listlessly in their saddles their hat brims
pulled low over tired eyes that smarted with dust and wind and burning
heat

Pink sighed and wished lonesomely that it was Rowdy riding point with
him instead of the Silent One who grew even more silent as the day
dragged leadenly to midafternoon Pink could endure anything better
than being left to his thoughts and to the complaining herd for company

He took off his hat pushed back his curlsdripping wet they were and
flattened unbecomingly in pasty yellow rings on his foreheadand eyed
with disfavor a linebacked dry cow with one horn tipped rakishly
toward her speckled nose she blinked silently at wind and heat and
forged steadily ahead uphill and down coulee always in the lead
always walking walking like an automaton Her energy in the face of
all the dry dreary days rasped Pinks nerves unbearably For nearly a
week he had ridden left point and always that linebacked cow with the
downcrumpled horn walked and walked and walked a length ahead of her
most intrepid followers

He leaned from his saddle picked up a rock from the barren yellow
hillside and threw it at the cow spitefully The rock bounced off her
lean rump she blinked and broke into a shuffling trot her dragging
hoofs kicking up an extra amount of dust which blew straight into
Pinks face

Aw cut it out he shouted petulantly Youre sure the limit without
doing any stunts at sprinting uphill Aint yuh got any nerves yuh
blamed old skate Yuh act like it was milkintime and yuh was headed
straight for the bars and a bran mash Cant yuh realize the kind uh
deal youre up against Heres cattle thats got you skinned for looks
old girl and they know its coming blamed tough and you just bat your
eyes and peg along like yuh enjoyed it Bawl or something cant yuh
Drop back a foot and act human

The Silent One looked across at him with a tired smile Let her go
Pink and pray for more like her he called amusedly Therell be
enough of them dropping back presently

Pink threw one leg over the horn and rode sidewise made him a
cigarette and tried to forget the cowor at least to forgive her for
not acting as dogtired as he felt

They were on the very peak of the ridge now and the hill sloped
smoothly down before them to the bluff which bounded Quitter Creek Far
down a tiny black speck in the couleebottom they could see Wooden
Shoes riding along the creekbank scouting for water From the way he
rode and from the fact that camp was nowhere in sight Pink guessed
shrewdly that his quest was in vain He shrugged his shoulders at what
that meant and gave his attention to the herd

The marching line split at the brow of the bluff The linebacked
cow lowered her head a bit and went unfaltering down the parched
gravelcoated hill followed by a few hundred of the freshest Then the
stream stopped flowing and Pink and the Silent One rode back up the
bluff to where the bulk of the footsore herd their senses dulled by
hunger and weariness and choking thirst sniffed at the gravel that
promised agony to their bruised feet and balked at the ordeal Others
straggled up bunched against the rebels and stood stolidly where they
were

Pink galloped on down the crawling line Forward the Standard Oil
Brigade he yelled whimsically as he went

The cowboys heardand understood They left their places and went
forward at a lope and Pink rode back to the coulee edge untying
his slicker as he went The Silent One was already off his horse and
shouting hoarsely as he whacked with his slicker at the sulky mass
Pink rode in and did the same It was not the first time this thing had
happened and from a diversion it was verging closely on the monotonous
Presently even a rank tenderfoot must have caught the significance of
Pinks military expression The Standard Oil Brigade was at the front in
force

Cowboys swinging fivegallon oilcans picked up from scattered sheep
camps and carried many a weary mile for just such an emergency were
charging the bunch intrepidly Others made shift with flat sirupcans
with pebbles inside A few like Pink and the Silent One flapped their
slickers till their arms ached Anything everything that would make
a din and startle the cattle out of their lethargy was pressed into
service

But they might have been raised in a barnyard and fed cabbage leaves
from back doorsteps for all the excitement they showed Cattle that
three months agoor a monthwould run head and tail high in air at
sight of a man on foot backed away from a rattling banging cube of
gleaming tin turned and faced the thing dulleyed and apathetic

In time however they gave way dogedly before the onslaught A few were
forced shrinkingly down the hill others followed gingerly until the
line lengthened and flowed a sluggish brownred stream into the
coulee and across to Quitter Creek

Here the leaders were browsing greedily along the banks They had
emptied the few holes that had still held a meager store of brackish
water and so the mutinous bulk of the herd snuffed at the trampled
muddy spots and bellowed their disappointment

Wooden Shoes rode up and surveyed the half maddened animals gloomily
Push em on boys he said Theys nothings for em here Ive sent
the wagons on to Red Willow well try that next Push em along all yuh
can while I go on ahead and see

With tincans slickers and much vituperation they forced the herd up
the coulee side and strung them out again on trail The linebacked
cow walked and walked in the lead before Pinks querulous gaze and the
others plodded listlessly after The gray dustcloud formed anew over
their slowmoving backs and the cowboys humped over in their saddles
and rode and rode with the hot sun beating aslant in their dirtgrimed
faces and with the wind blowing and blowing

If this had been the first herd to make that dreary trip things would
not have been quite so disheartening But it was the third Seven
thousand lean kine had passed that way before them eating the scant
grass growth and drinking what water they could find among those barren
sunbaked coulees

The Cross L boys on this third trip were become a jaded lot of
holloweyed men whose nerves were rasped raw with long hours and longer
days in the saddle Pinks cheeks no longer made his name appropriate
and he was not the only one who grew fretful over small things Rowdy
had been heard more than once lately to anathematize viciously the
prairiedogs for standing on their tails and chipchipchipping at them
as they went by And though the Silent One did not swear he carried
rocks in his pockets and threw them with venomous precision at every
dog that showed his impertinent nose out of a burrow within range For
Pink he vented his spleen on the linebacked cow

So they walked and walked and walked

The cattle balked at another hill and all the tincans and slickers in
the crowd could scarcely move them The wind dropped with the sun and
the clouds glowed gorgeously above them getting scant notice except
that they told eloquently of the coming night and there were yet
mileslong rough heartbreaking milesto put behind them before
they could hope for the things their tired bodies craved supper and
dreamless sleep

When the last of the herd had sidled under protest down the long hill
to the flat dusk was pushing the horizon closer upon them mile by
mile When they crawled sinuously out upon the welcome level the hill
loomed ghostly and black behind them A mile out Wooden Shoes rode out
of the gloom and met the point He turned and rode beside Pink

Yuhll have t swing em north he greeted

Red Willows dry as hellall but in the Rockin R field No use askin
ole Mullen to let us in there well just go I sent the wagons through
the fence an yuhll find camp about a mile up from the mouth uh the
big coulee You swing em round the end uh this bench an hit that big
coulee at the head When you come t the fence tear it down Theys
awful good grass in that field

All right said Pink cheerfully It was in open defiance of range
etiquette but their need was desperate The only thing about it Pink
did not like was the long detour they must make He called the news
across to the Silent One after Wooden Shoes had gone on down the line
and they swung the point gradually to the left

Before that drive was over Pink had vowed many times to leave the range
forever and never to turn another cowbesides a good many other foolish
things which would be forgotten once he had a good sleep And Rowdy
plodding halfway down the herd had grown exceedingly pessimistic
regarding Jessie Conroy and decided that there was no sense in thinking
about her all the time the way he had been doing Also he told himself
savagely that if Harry ever crossed his trail again there would be
something doing This thing of letting a cur like that run roughshod
over a man on account of a girl that didnt care was plumb idiotic And
beside him the cattle walked and walked and walked a dim moving mass
in the quiet July night



CHAPTER 10 Harry Conroy at Home

It was late next morning when they got under way for they had not
reached camp until long after midnight and Wooden Shoes was determined
the cattle should have one good feed and all the water they wanted to
requite them for the hard drive of the day before

Pink rode out with Rowdy to the herda heavylidded gloomy Rowdy he
was and not amiably inclined toward the small talk of the range But
Pink had slept five whole hours and was almost his normal self which
means that speech was not to be denied him

What yuh mourning over he bantered Mad cause the reservations so
close

Sure assented Rowdy with deep sarcasm

Thats what I thought Studying up the nicest way uh giving
brotherinlaw the glad hand aint yuh

Hes no relation uh mineand never will be said Rowdy curtly And
Ill thank you Pink to drop that subject for good and all

Down she goes assented Pink quite unperturbed But the cards aint
all turned yet yuh want to remember I wouldnt pass on no hand like
youve got If I wanted a girl right bad Rowdy Id wait till I got
refused before Id quit

Seems to me youve changed your politics lately Rowdy retorted A
while back you was cussing the whole business and now youre worse than
an old maid aunt Pink you may not be wise to the fact but you sure
are an inconsistent little devil

Are yuh going t hunt Harry up and

I thought I told you to drop that

Did yuh All right thenonly I hope yuh didnt leave your gun packed
away in your bed he insinuated

You can take a look tonight if you want to

Pink laughed in a particularly infectious way he had and before he
quite knew it Rowdy was laughing also After that the world did not
look quite so forlorn as it had nor the days work so distasteful So
Pink having accomplished his purpose was content to turn the subject

Theres old Lineyhe pointed her out to Rowdyfresh as a
meadowlark I had a big grouch against her yesterday just because she
batted her eyes and kept putting one foot ahead uh the other I could
a killed her But shes all right that old girl The way she led out
down that black coulee last night wasnt slow Say shes an ambitious
old party I wish you was riding point with me Rowdy The Silent One
talks just about as much as that old cow He sure loves to live up to
his rep

Oh go on to work Rowdy admonished You make me think of a magpie
All the same he looked after him with smiling lips and eyes that
forgot their gloom He even whistled while he helped round up the
scattered herd ready for that last days drive

Every man in the outfit comforted himself with the thought that it
was the last days drive After long weeks of trailing lean herds over
barren windbrushed hills the last day meant much to them Even the
Silent One sang something they had never heard before about If Only I
Knew You Were True

They crossed the Rocking R field took down four panels of fence passed
out and carefully put them up again behind them Before them stretched
level plain for two miles beyond that a high rocky ridge that promised
some trouble with the herd and after that more plain and a couleee or
two and then on a far slopethe reservation

The cattle were rested and fed and walked out briskly the ridge neared
perceptibly Pinks shrill whistle carried far back down the line and
mingled pleasantly with voices calling to one another across the herd
Not a man was humped listlessly in his saddle instead they rode with
shoulders back and hats at divers jaunty angles to keep the sun from
shining in eyes that faced the future cheerfully

The herd steadily climbed the ridge choosing the smoothest path and the
easiest slope Pink assured the linebacked cow that she was a peach
and told her to go to it old girl The Silent Ones pockets were
quite empty of rocks and the prairiedogs chipped and flirted their
funny little tails unassailed And Rowdy from wondering what had made
Pink change his attitude so abruptly began to plan industriously the
next meeting with Jessie Conroy and to build a new castle that was
higher and airier than any he had ever before attemptedand perhaps
had a more flimsy foundation for it rested precariously on Pinks idle
remarks

The point gained the top of the ridge and Pink turned and swung his hat
jubilantly at the others The reservation was in sight though it lay
several miles distant But in that clear air one could distinguish the
line fenceif one had the eye of faith and knew just where to look
Presently he observed a familiar horseman climbing the ridge to meet
them

Eagle Creeks coming he shouted to the man behind Come alive
there and dont let em roam all over the map Git some style on yuh

Those who heard laughed no one ever dreamed of being offended at what
Pink said Those who had not heard had the news passed on to them
in various forms Wooden Shoes who had been loitering in the rear
gossiping with the men rode on to meet Smith

Eagle Creek urged his horse up the last steep place right in the face
of the leaders which halted and tried to turn back Pink swearing in a
whisper began to force them forward

Let em alone Eagle Creek bellowed harshly They aint goin no
farther

Wwhat Pink stopped short and eyed him critically Eagle Creek could
not justly be called a teetotaler but Pink had never known him to
get worse than a bit wobbly in his legs his mind had never fogged
perceptibly Still something was wrong with him that was certain
Pink glanced dubiously across at the Silent One and saw him shrug his
shoulders expressively

Eagle Creek rode up and stopped within ten feet of the linebacked cow
she seemed hurt at being held up in this manner Pink thought

Yuhll have t turn this herd back Eagle Creek announced bluntly

Where to Pink asked too stunned to take in the meaning of it

T hell I guess Its the only place I know of where everybodys
welcome Eagle Creeks tone was not pleasant

We just came from there Pink said simply thinking of the horrors of
that drive

Wheres Wooden Shoes snapped the old man and the foremans hatcrown
appeared at that instant over the ridge

Well were up against it Eagle Creek greeted That damn agentor
the fellow he had workin for himreported his renting us pasture Made
the report read about twice as many as were puttin on Hes got orders
now t turn out every hoof but what blongs there

My Lord Wooden Shoes gasped at the catastrophe which faced the Cross
L

Thats Harry Conroys work Pink cut in sharply Hed hurt the Cross
L if he could t spite me and Rowdy He

Dont matterseein its done Yuh might as well turn the herd loose
right here an let em go t the devil I dont know what else t do
with em

Anything gone wrong It was Rowdy who had left his place and ridden
forward to see what was holding the herd back

Naw Were fired off the reservation is all We got orders to take the
herd to hell Eagle Creeks leased it Mr Satan is going to keep house
here in Montana he says its better for his trade Pink informed him
in his girlish treble

Eagle Creek turned on him fiercely then thought better of it and
grinned Them arrangements wouldnt make us any worse offn what we
are he commented Turn em loose boys

Man if yuh turn em loose here the first storm that hits em they
all die Wooden Shoes interposed excitedly They aint nothings for
em We had t turn em into the Rockin R field last night t
git water an feed Red Willows gone dry outside dat field They
aintnothings Theyll die

Eagle Creek looked at him dully For the first time in his life he faced
utter ruin Damn em let em die then he said

Thats what theyll sure do Wooden Shoes reiterated stubbornly If
they dont git feed and water now yuh neednt start no roundup next
spring

Pinks eyes went down over the closehuddled backs and the thicket
of polished horns and his eyelids stung Would all of them die he
wondered Four thousand He hoped not There must be some way out Down
the hill he knew the cowboys were making cigarettes while they waited
and wondered mightily what it was all about If they only knew he
thought there would be more than one rope ready for Harry Conroy

How about the Peck reservation Couldnt you get them on there Rowdy
ventured

Not a hoof growled Eagle Creek with his chin sunk against his chest
Theres thirty thousand Valley County cattle on there now He looked
down at the cattle as Pink had done God Its bad enough t go
broke he groaned but t think uh them poor brutes dyin off in
bunches for want uh grass an water Ive run that brand fer over
thirty year



CHAPTER 11 Rowdy Promoted

Rowdy rode closer If you dont mind paying duty he began
tentatively I can put you next to a range over the line where Ill
guarantee feed and water the year round for every hoof you own

Eagle Creek lifted his head and looked at him Whereabouts he demanded
skeptically

Up in the Red Deer country Pink knows the place Theres range
aplenty and creeks running through that never go dry and the country
isnt stocked and fenced to death like this is

And would we be ordered off soon as we got there

Sure notif you paid duty which would only be about double what you
were going to pay for one years pasture

Eagle Creek breathed deeply like a man who has narrowly escaped
suffocation Young man I blieve youre a square dealer and that yuh
savvy the cow business Ive thought it ever since yuh started t work
His keen old eyes twinkled at the memory of Rowdys arrival and Rowdy
grinned I take yuh at your word and yuh can consider yourself in
charge uh this herd as it stands Take it t that cow heaven yuh tell
aboutand damn it yuh wont be none the worse for it

Well pass that up said Rowdy quietly Ill take the herd through
though and Id advise you to get the rest on the road as soon as they
can be gathered Its a threehundredmile drive

All right From now on its up to you Eagle Creek told him briskly
Take em back t the Rockin R field and Ill send the wagons back
t you Old Mullenll likely make a roarbut thats most all govement
land hes got fenced so I guess I can calm him down Will yuh go near
the ranch

I think so said Rowdy It will be the shortest way

Well Ill give yuh some blank checks an you can load up with grub
and anything else yuh need Ill be over there by the time you are and
fix up that duty business Wooden Shoesll have t get another outfit
together and get another bunch on the trail One good thingI got
thirty days t get off what cattle is on there and thirty days uh grass
and waterll put em in good shape for the trip Wish this bunch was as
well fixed

Thats what Rowdy assented But I think theyll make it all right

Ill likely want yuh to stay up there and keep cases on em Any
objections

Sure not laughed Rowdy Only Ill want Pink and the Silent One to
stay with me

Keep what men yuh want Anything else

I dont think of anything said Rowdy Only Id like to have
atalkwith Conroy Creek eyed him sharply Yuh wont be apt t
meet him Old Bill Brown up home would like to see him too Bills
a perseverin old cuss and wants to see Conroy so bad hes got the
sheriff out lookin for him Its about a bunch uh horses that was run
off three years ago Yuh brought one of em back into the country last
spring yuh mind

Rowdy and Pink looked at one another but said nothing

Old Bill he follered your back trail and found out some things he
wanted t know Conroy got wind of it though and he left the agency
kinda suddint No use yuh lookin for him

Then were ready to hit the grit I guess Rowdy glanced again at Pink
who nodded

Well I aint stoppin yuh Eagle Creek drawled laconically Slong
and good luck t yuh

He waited while Pink and the Silent One swung the point back down the
hill with Rowdy helping them quite unmoved by his sudden promotion
When the herd was fairly started on the backward march Eagle Creek
nodded satisfaction the while he pried off a corner of plugtobacco

Hes all right he asserted emphatically That boy suits me from
the ground up If he dont put that deal through in good shape itll be
becaus it cant be did

Wooden Shoes with whom Rowdy had always been a prime favorite agreed
with Dutch heartiness Then leaving the herd to its new guardian they
rode swiftly to overtake and turn back the wagons

Three hundred miles And part of it across howling desert Rowdy drew
his brows together Its a big thing for me all right Pink but its
sure a big contract to take this herd through if anybody should happen
to ask yuh

Oh buck up Youll make good all rightif only these creeks wasnt
so bone dry

Well theres water enough in the Rocking R field for today well
throw em in there till tomorrow And Ive a notion I can find a better
trail across to North Fork than the way we came Im going to strike
out this afternoon and see anyway if Quitter Creek hasnt got water
farther up Once we get up north uh the home ranch I can see my way
clear

Go to it boss Pink cried heartily I dont see how Im goin t
keep from sassing yuh once in a while though Thats what bothers me
Whatll happen if I turn loose on yuh some time

Youll get fired I expect laughed Rowdy and rode off to announce
the news to the rest of the outfit who were very unhappy in their
mystification

If their reception of the change of plans and foreman was a bit profane
and their manner toward him a bit familiar Rowdy didnt mind He knew
that they did not grudge him his good luck even while they hated
the long drive He also knew that they watched him furtively for
nothingnot even misfortuneis as sure a test of a mans character
as success They liked Rowdy and they did not believe this would spoil
him still every man of them was secretly a bit anxious

On the trail he rode in his accustomed place and so far as
appearances went the party had no foreman He went forward and helped
Pink take down the fence that had been so carefully put up a few hours
before and he whistled while he put it in place again just as if
he had no responsibility in the world Then the cattle were left to
themselves and the men rode down to their old campground marked by
empty tincans and a trodden place where had been the horse corral

Rowdy swung down and faced the men gravely Instinctively they stood at
attention waiting for what he had to say they felt that the situation
was so far out of the ordinary that a few remarks pertaining to their
new relations would not be out of place

He looked them over appraisingly and met glances as grave as his own
Straight capable fellows they were every man of them

Boys he began impressively you all know that from today on youre
working under my orders I never was boss of anything but the cayuse I
happened to have under me and Im going to extract all the honey there
is in the situation Maybe Ill never be boss againbut at present Im
it I want you fellows to remember that important fact and treat me
with proper respect From now on you can call me Mr Vaughan Rowdy
doesnt go except on a legal holiday

Furthermore Im not going to get out at daylight and catch up my own
horse Ill let yuh take turns being flunky and Ill expect yuh
to saddle my horse every morning and noon and bring him to the
cooktentand hold my stirrup for me Also you are expected at
all times and places to anticipate my wants and fall over yourselves
waiting on me Youre just common ordinary fortydollar cowpunchers
and if I treat yuh white its because I pity yuh for not being up where
I am Remember vassals that Im your superior mentally morally
socially

Chap him yelled Pink and made for him Ill stand for a lot but
dont yuh ever think Im a vassal

Mutiny is strictly prohibited he thundered Villains beware
Gadzookserlets have a swim before the wagons come

They laughed and made for the creek feeling rather crestfallen and a
bit puzzled

If I had an outfit like this to run and a three hundredmile drive to
make Bob Nevin remarked to the Silent One blessed if Id make a josh
of it Id cultivate the corrugated brow and the stiff spineme

My friend the Silent One responded dont be too hasty in your
judgment Its because the corrugated brow will come later that he
laughs now Youll presently find yourself accomplishing the impossible
in obedience to the flicker of Rowdy Vaughans eyelids Man did you
never observe the set of his head and the look of his eye Rowdy
Vaughan will get more out of this crowd than any man ever did and if he
fails hell fail with the band playing Hot Time

Maybe so Bob admitted not quite convinced but I wonder if he
realizes what hes up against At which the Silent One only smiled
queerly as he splashed into the water

After dinner Rowdy caught up the blue roan which was his favorite for
a hard ridehe seemed to have forgotten his speech concerning
flunkiesand rode away up the coulee which had brought them into the
field the night before The boys watched him go speculated a lot and
went to sleep as the best way of putting in the afternoon

Pink who knew quite well what was in Rowdys mind said nothing at all
it is possible that he was several degrees more jealous of the dignity
of Rowdys position than was Rowdy himself who had no time to think of
anything but the best way of getting the herd to Canada He would like
to have gone along only that Rowdy did not ask him to Pink assured
himself that it was best for Rowdy not to start playing any favorites
and curled down in the bedtent with the others and went to sleep

It was late that night when Rowdy crept silently into his corner of
the tent but Pink was awake and whispered to know if he found water
Rowdys Yes was a mere breath but it was enough

At sunrise the herd trailed up the Rocking R coulee and Pink and the
Silent One pointed them north of the old trail



CHAPTER 12 You Can Tell Jessie

In the days that followed Rowdy was much alone There was water to
hunt far ahead of the herd together with the most practicable way of
reaching it He did not take the shortest way across that arid country
and leave the next days campingplace to chanceas Wooden Shoes had
done He felt that there was too much at stake and the cattle were too
thin for any more dry drives long drives there were but such was his
generalship that there was always water at the end

He rode miles and miles that he might have shirked and he never slept
until the next days move at least was clearly defined in his mind and
he felt sure that he could do no better by going another route

These lonely rides gave him over to the clutch of thoughts he had never
before harbored in his sunny nature Grim ugly thoughts they were and
not nice to remember afterward They swung persistently around a central
subject as the earth revolves around the sun and like the earth they
turned and turned on the axis of his love for a woman

In particularly ugly moods he thought that if Harry Conroy were caught
and convicted of horsestealing Jessie must perforce admit his guilt and
general unworthinessRowdy called it general cussednessand Rowdy be
vindicated in her eyes Then she would marry him and go with him to
the Red Deer country andaircastles for miles When he awoke to the
argument again he would tell himself savagely that if he could by any
means bring about Conroys speedy conviction he would do so

This was unlike Rowdy whose generous charity toward his enemies came
near being a fault He might feel any amount of resentment for wrong
done but coldblooded revenge was not in him that he had suffered
so much at Conroys hands was due largely to the fact that Conroy was
astute enough to read Rowdy aright and unscrupulous enough to take
advantage Add to that a smallminded jealousy of Rowdys popularity and
horsemanship one can easily imagine him doing some rather nasty things
Perhaps the meanest and the one which rankled most in Rowdys memory
was the cutting of Rowdys latigo just before a riding contest in which
the purse and the glory of a championshipbelt seemed in danger of going
to Rowdy

Rowdy had got a fall that crippled him for weeks and Harry had won the
purse and beltand the enmity of several men better than he For though
morally sure of his guilt no one could prove that he had cut the strap
and so he got off unpunished except that Pink thrashed hima bit
unscientifically it is true since he resorted to throwing rocks toward
the last but with a thoroughness worthy even of Pink

But in moods less ugly he shrank from the hurt that must be Jessies
if she should discover the truth Jessies brother a convicted thief
serving his sentence in Deer Lodge The thought was horrible it was
brutal cruelty If he could only know where to look for that lad hed
help him out of the country It was no good shutting him up in jail
that wouldnt help him any or make him better He hoped he would get
offgo somewhere where they couldnt find him and stay there

He wondered where he was and if he had money enough to see him through
He might be no goodhe sure wasntbut he was Jessies brother and
Jessie believed in him and thought a lot of him It would be hard lines
for that little girl if Harry were caught Bill Brown the meddlesome
old freakhe didnt blame Jessie for not wanting to stop there that
night She did just the right thing

With all this going round and round monotonously persistent in his
brain and with the care of four thousand lean kine and more than a
hundred saddlehorsesto say nothing of a dozen overworked fretful
cowpunchersRowdy acquired the corrugated brow fast enough without
any cultivation

The men were as the Silent One had predicted They made drives that
lasted far into the night stood guard and got along with so little
sleep that it was scarce worth mention and did many things that shaved
close the impossiblejust because Rowdy looked at them straightly with
halfclosed lids and asked them if they thought they could

Pink began to speak of their new foreman as Moses and when the
curious asked him why told them soberly that Rowdy could hit a rock
with his quirt and start a creek running bank full When Rowdy heard
that he thought of the miles of weary searching and wished that it
were true

They had left the home ranch a days drive behind them and were going
north Rowdy had denied himself the luxury of riding over to see Jessie
and he was repenting the sacrifice in deep gloom and sincerity when two
men rode into camp and dismounted as if they had a right The taller
onewith brawn and brain aplenty by the look of himannounced that
he was the sheriff and would like to stop overnight

Rowdy gave him welcome halfheartedly and questioned him craftily
A sheriff is not a detective and does not mind giving harmless
information so Rowdy learned that they had traced Conroy thus far and
believed that he was ahead of them and making for Canada He had dodged
them cleverly two or three times but now they had reason to believe
that he was not more than half a days ride before them They wanted to
know if the outfit had seen any one that day or sign of any one having
passed that way

Rowdy shook his head

I bet it was Harry Conroy driving that little bunch uh horses up the
creek just as we come over the ridge spoke Pink eagerly

Rowdy could have choked him He wouldnt be driving a lot of horses
he interposed quickly

Well he might argued Pink If I was making a quick getaway and
my horse was about played outlike his was apt t beId sure round
up the first bunch I seen and catch me a fresh oneif I was a
horsethief Ill bet yuh

The sheriff had put down his cup of coffee Is there any place where a
man could corral a bunch on the quiet he asked crisply It was evident
that Pinks theory had impressed him

Yes there is Theres an old corral up at the fordDrowning Ford
they call itthat Id use if it was me It was an old line camp
and theres a cabin Its down on the flat by the creek and its as
Godforsaken a place as a mand want t hide in or t change mounts
Pink hitched up his chapbelt and looked across at Rowdy He was aching
for a sight of Harry Conroy in handcuffs and he was certain that Rowdy
felt the same If it was me he added speculatively and I thought I
was far enough in the lead Id stop there till morning

How far is it from here demanded the sheriff standing up

Pink told him he guessed it was five miles Whereupon the sheriff
announced his intention of going up there at once and Pink hinted
rather strongly that he would like to go with them The sheriff did not
know Pink he looked down at his slimness and at the yellow fringe of
curls showing under his hat brim at his pink cheeks and dimples and
girlish hands and threw back his head in a loud ha ha

Pink asked him politely but rather stiffly what there was funny about
it The sheriff laughed louder and longer then being the sort of man
who likes a joke now and then even in the way of business he solemnly
deputized Pink and patted him on the shoulder and told him gravely that
they couldnt possibly do without him

It looked for a minute as if Pink were going at him with his fistsbut
he didnt He reflected that one must not offer violence to an officer
of the law and that being made a deputy he would have to go anyway
so he gritted his teeth and buckled on his gun and went along sulkily

They rode silently for the most part and swiftly

Even in the dusk they could see where a band of horses had been driven
at a gallop along the creek bank When they neared the place it was
dark Pink pulled up and spoke for the first time since leaving the
tent

We better tie up our horses here and walk he said quite unconscious
of the fact that he was usurping the leadership and thinking only of
their quest

But the sheriff was old at the business and not too jealous of his
position He signed to his deputy proper and they dismounted

When they started on Pink was ahead The sheriff observed that Pinks
gun still swung in its scabbard at his hip and he grinnedbut that was
because he didnt know Pink That the gun swung at his hip would have
been quite enough for any one who did know him it didnt take Pink all
day to get into action

Ten rods from the corral which they could distinguish as a black blotch
in the sparse willow growth Pink turned and stopped them I know the
layout here he whispered Ill just sneak ahead and rubber around
You Rubes sound like the beginning of a stampede in this brush

The sheriff had never before been called a Rubeto his face at least
The audacity took his breath and when he opened his mouth for scathing
speech Pink was not there He had slipped away like a slim elusive
shadow and the sheriff did not even know the exact direction of his
going There was nothing for it but to wait

In five minutes Pink appeared with a silent suddenness that startled
them more than they would like to own

Hes somewheres around he announced in a murmur that would not carry
ten feet Hes got a horse in the corral and from the sound hes got
him all saddled and the gates tied shut with a rope

How dyuh know grunted the sheriff crossly

Felt of it yuh chump Hes turned the bunch loose and kept up a fresh
one like I said he would Its blame dark but I could see the horsea
big white devil Its him yuh hear makin all that racket If he gits
away now

Well we didnt come for a chinwhackin bee snapped the sheriff I
come out here t git him

Pink gritted his teeth again and wished the sheriff was just a man
so he could lick him He led them forward without a word thinking that
Rowdy wanted Harry Conroy captured

The sheriff circled warily the corral peered through the rails at the
great white horse that ran here and there whinnying occasionally for
the band and heard the creak of leather and the rattle of the bit Pink
was right the horse was saddled ready for immediate flight

Maybe hes in the cabin he whispered coming up where Pink stood
listening tensely at all the little night sounds Pink turned and crept
silently to the right keeping in the deepest shade while the others
followed willingly They were beginning to see the great advantage of
having Pink along even if he had called them Rubes

The cabin door yawned wide open and creaked weirdly as the light wind
moved it the interior was black and silentsuspiciously silent in
the opinion of the sheriff He waited for some time before venturing
in fearing an ambush Then he caught the flicker of a shielded match
called out to Conroy to surrender and leveled his gun at the place

There was no answer but the faint shuffle of stealthy feet on the board
floor The sheriff called another warning cocked his gunand came near
shooting Pink who walked composedly out of the door into the sheriffs
astonished face The sheriff had been sure that Pink was just behind
him

What the hell began the sheriff explosively

He aint here said Pink simply I crawled in the window and hunted
the place over

The sheriff glared at him dumbly he could not reconcile Pinks
daredevil behavior with Pinks innocent girlish appearance

I tell yuh the corrals what we want t keep cases on Pink added
insistently Hes sure somewheres aroundId gamble on it He saddled
that horse t git away on That horse is sure the key t this situation
oldtimer If you fellowsll keep cases on the gate Ill cover the
rear

He made his way quietly to the back of the corral inwardly much amused
at the tractability of the sheriff who took his deputy obediently to
watch the gate

Pink squatted comfortably in the shade of a willow and wished he dared
indulge in a cigarette and wondered what scheme Harry was trying to
play

Fifty feet away the big white horse still circled round and round
rattling his bridle impatiently and shaking the saddle in an occasional
access of rage and whinnying lonesomely out into the gloom

So they waited and waited and peered into the shadows and listened to
the trampling horse fretting for freedom and his mates

The cook had just called breakfast when Pink dashed up to the tent
flung himself from his horse and confronted Rowdya holloweyed
haggard Rowdy who had not slept all night and whose eyes questioned
anxiously

Well Rowdy said with what passed for composure did you get him

Pink leaned against his horse with one hand reaching up and gripping
tightly the horn of the saddle His cheeks held not a trace of color
and his eyes were full of a great horror

Theyre bringin him t camp he answered huskily We found a
horsea big white horse they call the Fern Outlawthe Silent One
started and came closer listening intently evidently he knew the
horsesaddled in the corral and the gate tied shut We dubbed around
a while but we didnt findHarry So we camped down by the corral and
waited We set there all nightand the horse faunching around inside
something fierce Whenit come daybreakI seen somethingby the
fence inside It wasHarry Pink shivered and moistened his dry lips
That Fern Outlawsome uh the boys knowis a devil t mount Hed got
Harry downhell Rowdy itit was sureawful Hed been there all
nightand that horse stomping

Shut up Rowdy turned all at once deathly sick He had once seen a man
who had been trampled by a maddened mankilling horse It had not been
a pretty sight He sat down weakly and covered his face with his shaking
hands

The others stood around horrified muttering disjointed shocked
sentences

Pink lifted his head from where it had fallen upon his arm One thing
RowdyI done You can tell Jessie I shot that horse

Rowdy dropped his hands and stood up Yes he must tell Jessie

Youll have to take the herd on he told Pink in his masterful way
Ill catch you tomorrow some time Ive got to go back and tell
Jessie You know the trail I was going to takestraight across to Wild
Horse Lake From there you strike across to North Forkand if I dont
overtake you on the way Ill hit camp some time in the night Its all
plain sailing



CHAPTER 13 Rowdy Finds Happiness

Miss Conroy was rather listlessly endeavoring to persuade the First
Reader class that catch should not be pronounced ketch when she saw
Rowdy ride past the window Intuition of something amiss sent her to the
door before he reached it

Cant you give the kids a day off he began without preface Ive
got such a lot to talk aboutand I dont come very often He thought
that his tone was perfectly natural but all the same she turned
white He rode on to a little tree and tied his horsenot that it was
necessary to tie him but to avoid questions

Miss Conroy went in and dismissed the children although it was only
fifteen minutes after nine They gathered up their lunchpails and
straggled out reluctantly roundeyed and curious Rowdy waited until
the last one had gone before he went in Miss Conroy sat in her chair
on the platform and she was still white otherwise she seemed to have
herself well in hand

Its about Harry she asserted rather sharply

Have theycaught him

Rowdy stopped halfway down the aisle and stared How did you know they
wereafter him

He came to me night before last andtold me She bit her lip took
firm hold on her honesty and her courage and went on steadily He
came because hewanted money Ive wanted to see you since to tell you
thatI misjudged you I know all about yourtrouble and I want you
to know that I think you arethat you did quite right You are to
understand that I cannot honestly upholdHarry He isnot the kind of
brotherI thought

Rowdy went clanking forward till only the table stood between Did he
tell you he demanded in a curious breathless fashion

No he did not He denied everything It was Pink He told me long
agothat evening just after youthe last time I saw you I told him
helied I tried not to believe it but I did Pink knew I would he
said so The other night I asked Harry aboutthose things he did to
you He lied to me Id have forgiven himbut he lied Icant forgive
that I

Hush Rowdy threw out a gloved hand quickly He could not bear to let
her go on like that

She looked up at him and all at once she was shaking Theres
somethingtell me

They didnt take him he said slowly weighing each word and
looking down at her pityingly They never will Hehad an accident A
horsefell with himandhe was dead when they picked him up It was
as merciful a version as he could make it but the words choked him
even then Girlie He went around and knelt with his arms holding her
close

After a long while he spoke again smoothing her hair absently and
never noticing that he had not taken off his gloves His gray hat was
pushed aslant as his head rested against hers

Perhaps girlie its for the best We couldnt have saved him
fromthe other and that would have been worse dont you think Well
forget all but the good in himhe could not help thinking that there
would not be much to rememberand Ill get a little home ready and
come back and get you before snow fliesandyoull be kind of happy
wont you

Maybe you havent heardbut Eagle Creek has made me foreman of his
outfit thats going to Canada Its a good position I can make you
comfortable girlieand happy Anyway Ill try mighty hard Youll be
ready for me when I comewont you girlie

Miss Conroy raised her face all tearstained but with the light of
happiness fighting the sorrow in her eyes nodded just enough to make
the movement perceptible and settled her head to a more comfortable
nestlingplace on his shoulder

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
