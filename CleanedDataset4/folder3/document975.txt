PART V Of the Power of the Understanding or of Human Freedom



PREFACE
At length I pass to the remaining portion of my Ethics which is concerned
with the way leading to freedom I shall therefore treat therein of the
power of the reason showing how far the reason can control the emotions
and what is the nature of Mental Freedom or Blessedness we shall then be
able to see how much more powerful the wise man is than the ignorant
It is no part of my design to point out the method and means whereby the
understanding may be perfected nor to show the skill whereby the body may
be so tended as to be capable of the due performance of its functions The
latter question lies in the province of Medicine the former in the province
of Logic Here therefore I repeat I shall treat only of the power of the
mind or of reason and I shall mainly show the extent and nature of its
dominion over the emotions for their control and moderation That we do
not possess absolute dominion over them I have already shown Yet the
Stoics have thought that the emotions depended absolutely on our will and
that we could absolutely govern them But these philosophers were compelled
by the protest of experience not from their own principles to confess
that no slight practice and zeal is needed to control and moderate them
and this someone endeavoured to illustrate by the example if I remember
rightly of two dogs the one a housedog and the other a huntingdog For
by long training it could be brought about that the housedog should become
accustomed to hunt and the huntingdog to cease from running after hares
To this opinion Descartes not a little inclines For he maintained that the
soul or mind is specially united to a particular part of the brain namely
to that part called the pineal gland by the aid of which the mind is
enabled to feel all the movements which are set going in the body and also
external objects and which the mind by a simple act of volition can put in
motion in various ways He asserted that this gland is so suspended in the
midst of the brain that it could be moved by the slightest motion of the
animal spirits further that this gland is suspended in the midst of the
brain in as many different manners as the animal spirits can impinge
thereon and again that as many different marks are impressed on the said
gland as there are different external objects which impel the animal
spirits towards it whence it follows that if the will of the soul suspends
the gland in a position wherein it has already been suspended once before
by the animal spirits driven in one way or another the gland in its turn
reacts on the said spirits driving and determining them to the condition
wherein they were when repulsed before by a similar position of the gland
He further asserted that every act of mental volition is united in nature
to a certain given motion of the gland For instance whenever anyone
desires to look at a remote object the act of volition causes the pupil of
the eye to dilate whereas if the person in question had only thought of
the dilatation of the pupil the mere wish to dilate it would not have
brought about the result inasmuch as the motion of the gland which serves
to impel the animal spirits towards the optic nerve in a way which would
dilate or contract the pupil is not associated in nature with the wish to
dilate or contract the pupil but with the wish to look at remote or very
near objects Lastly he maintained that although every motion of the
aforesaid gland seems to have been united by nature to one particular
thought out of the whole number of our thoughts from the very beginning of
our life yet it can nevertheless become through habituation associated with
other thoughts this he endeavours to prove in the Passions de lame I 50
He thence concludes that there is no soul so weak that it cannot under
proper direction acquire absolute power over its passions For passions as
defined by him are perceptions or feelings or disturbances of the soul
which are referred to the soul as species and which mark the expression
are produced preserved and strengthened through some movement of the
spirits Passion del lameI27 But seeing that we can join any motion
of the gland or consequently of the spirits to any volition the
determination of the will depends entirely on our own powers if therefore
we determine our will with sure and firm decisions in the direction to which
we wish our actions to tend and associate the motions of the passions which
we wish to acquire with the said decisions we shall acquire an absolute
dominion over our passions Such is the doctrine of this illustrious
philosopher in so far as I gather it from his own words it is one
which had it been less ingenious I could hardly believe to have proceeded
from so great a man Indeed I am lost in wonder that a philosopher who
had stoutly asserted that he would draw no conclusions which do not follow
from selfevident premisses and would affirm nothing which he did not
clearly and distinctly perceive and who had so often taken to task the
scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities through occult qualities
could maintain a hypothesis beside which occult qualities are commonplace
What does he understand I ask by the union of the mind and the body What
clear and distinct conception has he got of thought in most intimate union
with a certain particle of extended matter Truly I should like him to
explain this union through its proximate cause What clear and distinct
conception has he got of thought in most intimate union with a certain
particle of extended matter What clear and distinct conception has he got
of thought in most intimate union with a certain particle of extended
matter But he had so distinct a conception of mind being distinct from
body that he could not assign any particular cause of the union between the
two or of the mind itself but was obliged to have recourse to the cause of
the whole universe that is to God Further I should much like to know
what degree of motion the mind can impart to this pineal gland and with
what force can it hold it suspended For I am in ignorance whether this
gland can be agitated more slowly or more quickly by the mind than by the
animal spirits and whether the motions of the passions which we have
closely united with firm decisions cannot be again disjoined therefrom by
physical causes in which case it would follow that although the mind
firmly intended to face a given danger and had united to this decision the
motions of boldness yet at the sight of the danger the gland might become
suspended in a way which would preclude the mind thinking of anything
except running away In truth as there is no common standard of volition
and motion so is there no comparison possible between the powers of the
mind and the power or strength of the body consequently the strength of one
cannot in any wise be determined by the strength of the other We may also
add that there is no gland discoverable in the midst of the brain so
placed that it can thus easily be set in motion in so many ways and also
that all the nerves are not prolonged so far as the cavities of the brain
Lastly I omit all the assertions which he makes concerning the will and its
freedom inasmuch as I have abundantly proved that his premisses are false
Therefore since the power of the mind as I have shown above is defined by
the understanding only we shall determine solely by the knowledge of the
mind the remedies against the emotions which I believe all have had
experience of but do not accurately observe or distinctly see and from the
same basis we shall deduce all those conclusions which have regard to the
minds blessedness


AXIOMS
I If two contrary actions be started in the same subject a change must
necessarily take place either in both or in one of the two and continue
until they cease to be contrary

II The power of an effect is defined by the power of its cause in so far
as its essence is explained or defined by the essence of its cause This
axiom is evident from IIIvii


PROPOSITIONS

PropI Even as thoughts and the ideas of things are arranged
and associated in the mind so are the modifications of body or
the images of things precisely in the same way arranged and
associated in the body

Proof The order and connection of ideas is the same IIvii as the order
and connection of things and vice versa the order and connection of things
is the same IIviCoroll and IIvii as the order and connection of
ideas Wherefore even as the order and connection of ideas in the mind
takes place according to the order and association of modifications of the
body IIxviii so vice versa IIIii the order and connection of
modifications of the body takes place in accordance with the manner in
which thoughts and the ideas of things are arranged and associated in the
mind QED


PROPII If we remove a disturbance of the spirit or emotion
from the thought of an external cause and unite it to other
thoughts then will the love or hatred towards that external cause
and also the vacillations of spirit which arise from these
emotions be destroyed

Proof That which constitutes the reality of love or hatred is pleasure
or pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause Def of the
Emotionsvivii wherefore when this cause is removed the reality of
love or hatred is removed with it therefore these emotions and those
which arise therefrom are destroyed QED


PropIII An emotion which is a passion ceases to be a
passion as soon as we form a clear and distinct idea thereof

Proof An emotion which is a passion is a confused idea by the general
Def of the Emotions If therefore we form a clear and distinct idea of a
given emotion that idea will only be distinguished from the emotion in so
far as it is referred to the mind only by reason IIxxiNote therefore
IIIiii the emotion will cease to be a passion QED

Corollary An emotion therefore becomes more under our control and the
mind is less passive in respect to it in proportion as it is more known to
us


PropIV There is no modification of the body whereof we
cannot form some clear and distinct conception

Proof Properties which are common to all things can only be conceived
adequately IIxxxviii therefore IIxiiand Lemma ii after IIxiii
there is no modification of the body whereof we cannot form some clear and
distinct conception QED

Corollary Hence it follows that there is no emotion whereof we cannot
form some clear and distinct conception For an emotion is the idea of a
modification of the body by the general Def of the Emotions and must
therefore by the preceding Prop involve some clear and distinct
conception

Note Seeing that there is nothing which is not followed by an effect
Ixxxvi and that we clearly and distinctly understand whatever
follows from an idea which in us is adequate IIxl it follows that
everyone has the power of clearly and distinctly understanding himself and
his emotions if not absolutely at any rate in part and consequently of
bringing it about that he should become less subject to them To attain
this result therefore we must chiefly direct our efforts to acquiring as
far as possible a clear and distinct knowledge of every emotion in order
that the mind may thus through emotion be determined to think of those
things which it clearly and distinctly perceives and wherein it fully
acquiesces and thus that the emotion itself may be separated from the
thought of an external cause and may be associated with true thoughts
whence it will come to pass not only that love hatred c will be
destroyed Vii but also that the appetites or desires which are wont to
arise from such emotion will become incapable of being excessive IVlxi
For it must be especially remarked that the appetite through which a man is
said to be active and that through which he is said to be passive is one
and the same For instance we have shown that human nature is so
constituted that everyone desires his fellowmen to live after his own
fashion IIIxxxiNote in a man who is not guided by reason this
appetite is a passion which is called ambition and does not greatly differ
from pride whereas in a man who lives by the dictates of reason it is an
activity or virtue which is called piety IVxxxviiNotei and second
proof In like manner all appetites or desires are only passions in so far
as they spring from inadequate ideas the same results are accredited to
virtue when they are aroused or generated by adequate ideas For all
desires whereby we are determined to any given action may arise as much
from adequate as from inadequate ideas IVlix Than this remedy for the
emotions to return to the point from which I started which consists in a
true knowledge thereof nothing more excellent being within our power can
be devised For the mind has no other power save that of thinking and of
forming adequate ideas as we have shown above IIIiii


PropV An emotion towards a thing which we conceive
simply and not as necessary or as contingent or as possible is
other conditions being equal greater than any other emotion

Proof An emotion towards a thing which we conceive to be free is greater
than one towards what we conceive to be necessary IIIxlix and
consequently still greater than one towards what we conceive as possible
or contingent IVxi But to conceive a thing as free can be nothing else
than to conceive it simply while we are in ignorance of the causes whereby
it has been determined to action IIxxxvNote therefore an emotion
towards a thing which we conceive simply is other conditions being equal
greater than one which we feel towards what is necessary possible or
contingent and consequently it is the greatest of all QED


PropVI The mind has greater power over the emotions and is
less subject thereto in so far as it understands all things as
necessary

Proof The mind understands all things to be necessary Ixxix and to be
determined to existence and operation by an infinite chain of causes
therefore by the foregoing Proposition it thus far brings it about that
it is less subject to the emotions arising therefrom and IIIxlviii
feels less emotion towards the things themselves QED

Note The more this knowledge that things are necessary is applied to
particular things which we conceive more distinctly and vividly the
greater is the power of the mind over the emotions as experience also
testifies For we see that the pain arising from the loss of any good is
mitigated as soon as the man who has lost it perceives that it could not
by any means have been preserved So also we see that no one pities an
infant because it cannot speak walk or reason or lastly because it
passes so many years as it were in unconsciousness Whereas if most
people were born fullgrown and only one here and there as an infant
everyone would pity the infants because infancy would not then be looked on
as a state natural and necessary but as a fault or delinquency in Nature
and we may note several other instances of the same sort


PropVII Emotions which are aroused or spring from reason if
we take account of time are stronger than those which are
attributable to particular objects that we regard as absent

Proof We do not regard a thing as absent by reason of the emotion
wherewith we conceive it but by reason of the body being affected by
another emotion excluding the existence of the said thing IIxvii
Wherefore the emotion which is referred to the thing which we regard as
absent is not of a nature to overcome the rest of a mans activities and
power IVvi but is on the contrary of a nature to be in some sort
controlled by the emotions which exclude the existence of its external
cause IVix But an emotion which springs from reason is necessarily
referred to the common properties of things see the def of reason in
IIxlNoteii which we always regard as present for there can be nothing
to exclude their present existence and which we always conceive in the
same manner IIxxxviii Wherefore an emotion of this kind always remains
the same and consequently VAxi emotions which are contrary thereto
and are not kept going by their external causes will be obliged to adapt
themselves to it more and more until they are no longer contrary to it to
this extent the emotion which springs from reason is more powerful QED


PropVIII An emotion is stronger in proportion to the number of
simultaneous concurrent causes whereby it is aroused

Proof Many simultaneous causes are more powerful than a few IIIvii
therefore IVv in proportion to the increased number of simultaneous
causes whereby it is aroused an emotion becomes stronger QED

Note This proposition is also evident from VAxii

PropIX An emotion which is attributable to many and diverse
causes which the mind regards as simultaneous with the emotion
itself is less hurtful and we are less subject thereto and less
affected towards each of its causes than if it were a different and
equally powerful emotion attributable to fewer causes or to a
single cause

Proof An emotion is only bad or hurtful in so far as it hinders the mind
from being able to think IVxxvi IVxxvii therefore an emotion
whereby the mind is determined to the contemplation of several things at
once is less hurtful than another equally powerful emotion which so
engrosses the mind in the single contemplation of a few objects or of one
that it is unable to think of anything else this was our first point
Again as the minds essence in other words its power IIIvii consists
solely in thought IIxi the mind is less passive in respect to an
emotion which causes it to think of several things at once than in regard
to an equally strong emotion which keeps it engrossed in the contemplation
of a few or of a single object this was our second point Lastly this
emotion IIIxlviii in so far as it is attributable to several causes is
less powerful in regard to each of them QED


PropX So long as we are not assailed by emotions contrary to
our nature we have the power of arranging and associating the
modifications of our body according to the intellectual order

Proof The emotions which are contrary to our nature that is IVxxx
which are bad are bad in so far as they impede the mind from understanding
IVxxvii So long therefore as we are not assailed by emotions contrary
to our nature the minds power whereby it endeavours to understand things
IVxxvi is not impeded and therefore it is able to form clear and
distinct ideas and to deduce them one from another IIxlNoteii and
IIxlviiNote consequently we have in such cases the power of arranging
and associating the modifications of the body according to the intellectual
order QED

Note By this power of rightly arranging and associating the bodily
modifications we can guard ourselves from being easily affected by evil
emotions For Vvii a greater force is needed for controlling the
emotions when they are arranged and associated according to the
intellectual order than when they are uncertain and unsettled The best we
can do therefore so long as we do not possess a perfect knowledge of our
emotions is to frame a system of right conduct or fixed practical
precepts to commit it to memory and to apply it forthwith to the
particular circumstances which now and again meet us in life so that our
imagination may become fully imbued therewith and that it may be always
ready to our hand For instance we have laid down among the rules of life
IVxlvi  Note that hatred should be overcome with love or high
mindedness and not required with hatred in return Now that this precept
of reason may be always ready to our hand in time of need we should often
think over and reflect upon the wrongs generally committed by men and in
what manner and way they may be best warded off by highmindedness we shall
thus associate the idea of wrong with the idea of this precept which
accordingly will always be ready for use when a wrong is done to us
IIxviii If we keep also in readiness the notion of our true
advantage and of the good which follows from mutual friendships and common
fellowships further if we remember that complete acquiescence is the
result of the right way of life IVlii and that men no less than
everything else act by the necessity of their nature in such case I say
the wrong or the hatred which commonly arises therefrom will engross a
very small part of our imagination and will be easily overcome or if the
anger which springs from a grievous wrong be not overcome easily it will
nevertheless be overcome though not without a spiritual conflict far
sooner than if we had not thus reflected on the subject beforehand As is
indeed evident from VviVviiVviii We should in the same way reflect
on courage as a means of overcoming fear the ordinary dangers of life
should frequently be brought to mind and imagined together with the means
whereby through readiness of resource and strength of mind we can avoid and
overcome them But we must note that in arranging our thoughts and
conceptions we should always bear in mind that which is good in every
individual thing IVlxiiiCoroll and IIIlix in order that we may
always be determined to action by an emotion of pleasure For instance if
a man sees that he is too keen in the pursuit of honour let him think over
its right use the end for which it should be pursued and the means whereby
he may attain it Let him not think of its misuse and its emptiness and
the fickleness of mankind and the like whereof no man thinks except
through a morbidness of disposition with thoughts like these do the
most ambitious most torment themselves when they despair of gaining the
distinctions they hanker after and in thus giving vent to their anger would
fain appear wise Wherefore it is certain that those who cry out the
loudest against the misuse of honour and the vanity of the world are those
who most greedily covet it This is not peculiar to the ambitious but is
common to all who are illused by fortune and who are infirm in spirit
For a poor man also who is miserly will talk incessantly of the misuse of
wealth and of the vices of the rich whereby he merely torments himself and
shows the world that he is intolerant not only of his own poverty but also
of other peoples riches So again those who have been ill received by a
woman they love think of nothing but the inconstancy treachery and other
stock faults of the fair sex all of which they consign to oblivion
directly they are again taken into favour by their sweetheart Thus he who
would govern his emotions and appetite solely by the love of freedom
strives as far as he can to gain a knowledge of the virtues and their
causes and to fill his spirit with the joy which arises from the true
knowledge of them he will in no wise desire to dwell on mens faults or to
carp at his fellows or to revel in a false show of freedom Whosoever will
diligently observe and practise these precepts which indeed are not
difficult will verily in a short space of time be able for the most
part to direct his actions according to the commandments of reason


PropXI In proportion as a mental image is referred to more
objects so is it more frequent or more often vivid and occupies
the mind more

Proof In proportion as a mental image or an emotion is referred to more
objects so are there more causes whereby it can be aroused and fostered
all of which by hypothesis the mind contemplates simultaneously in
association with the given emotion therefore the emotion is more frequent
or is more often in full vigour and Vviii occupies the mind more
QED


PropXII The mental images of things are more easily
associated with the images referred to things which we clearly
and distinctly understand than with others

Proof Things which we clearly and distinctly understand are either the
common properties of things or deductions therefrom see definition of
Reason IIxlNote ii and are consequently by the last Prop more
often aroused in us Wherefore it may more readily happen that we should
contemplate other things in conjunction with these than in conjunction with
something else and consequently IIxviii that the images of the said
things should be more often associated with the images of these than with
the images of something else QED


Prop XIII A mental image is more often vivid in proportion
as it is associated with a greater number of other images

Proof In proportion as an image is associated with a greater number of
other images so IIxviii are there more causes whereby it can be
aroused QED


Prop XIV The mind can bring it about that all bodily
modifications or images of things may be referred to the
idea of God

Proof There is no modification of the body whereof the mind may not form
some clear and distinct conception Viv wherefore it can bring it about
that they should all be referred to the idea of God Ixv QED


Prop XV He who clearly and distinctly understands himself
and his emotions loves God and so much the more in proportion
as he more understands himself and his emotions

Proof He who clearly and distinctly understands himself and his emotions
feels pleasure IIIliii and this pleasure is by the last Prop
accompanied by the idea of God therefore Def of the Emotionsvi such an
one loves God and for the same reason so much the more in proportion as
he more understands himself and his emotions QED


Prop XVI This love towards God must
hold the chief place in the mind

Proof For this love is associated with all the modifications of the body
Vxiv and is fostered by them all Vv therefore Vxi it must hold
the chief place in the mind QED


Prop XVII God is without passions
neither is he affected by
any emotion of pleasure or pain

Proof All ideas in so far as they are referred to God are true
IIxxxii that is IIDefiv adequate and therefore by the general
Def of the Emotions God is without passions Again God cannot pass either
to a greater or to a lesser perfection IxxCorollii therefore
by Def of the Emotionsii iii he is not affected by any emotion of
pleasure or pain

Corollary Strictly speaking God does not love or hate anyone For God by
the foregoing Prop is not affected by any emotion of pleasure or pain
consequently Def of the Emotionsvi vii he does not love or hate
anyone


PropXVIII No one can hate God

Proof The idea of God which is in us is adequate and perfect IIxlvi
IIxlvii wherefore in so far as we contemplate God we are active
IIIiii  consequently IIIlix there can be no pain accompanied by the
idea of God in other words Def of the Emotionsvii no one can hate
God QED

Corollary Love towards God cannot be turned into hate

Note It may be objected that as we understand God as the cause of all
things we by that very fact regard God as the cause of pain But I make
answer that in so far as we understand the causes of pain it to that
extent Viii ceases to be a passion that is it ceases to be pain
IIIlix therefore in so far as we understand God to be the cause of
pain we to that extent feel pleasure


Prop XIX He who loves God
cannot endeavour that God
should love him in return

Proof For if a man should so endeavour he would desire VxviiCoroll
that God whom he loves should not be God and consequently he would desire
to feel pain IIIxix which is absurd IIIxxviii Therefore he who
loves God c QED


Prop XX This love towards God cannot be stained by the
emotion of envy or jealousy contrariwise it is the more fostered
in proportion as we conceive a greater number of men to be
joined to God by the same bond of love

Proof This love towards God is the highest good which we can seek for
under the guidance of reason IVxxviii it is common to all men
IVxxxviand we desire that all should rejoice therein IVxxxvii
therefore Def of the Emotionsxxiii it cannot be stained by the
emotion envy nor by the emotion of jealousy Vxviii see definition of
Jealousy IIIxxxv Note but contrariwise it must needs be the more
fostered in proportion as we conceive a greater number of men to rejoice
therein QED

Note We can in the same way show that there is no emotion directly
contrary to this love whereby this love can be destroyed therefore we may
conclude that this love towards God is the most constant of all the
emotions and that in so far as it is referred to the body it cannot be
destroyed unless the body be destroyed also As to its nature in so far as
it is referred to the mind only we shall presently inquire
 I have now gone through all the remedies against the emotions or all
that the mind considered in itself alone can do against them Whence it
appears that the minds power over the emotions consists

 I In the actual knowledge of the emotions VivNote

 II In the fact that it separates the emotions from the thought of an
external cause which we conceive confusedly Vii and VivNote

 III In the fact that in respect to time the emotions referred to
things which we distinctly understand surpass those referred to what we
conceive in a confused and fragmentary manner Vvii

 IV In the number of causes whereby those modifications Affectiones
Camerer reads affectus  emotions are fostered which have regard to the
common properties of things or to God Vix Vxi

 V Lastly in the order wherein the mind can arrange and associate one
with another its own emotions VxNote and Vxii Vxiii Vxiv

But in order that this power of the mind over the emotions may be better
understood it should be specially observed that the emotions are called by
us strong when we compare the emotion of one man with the emotion of
another and see that one man is more troubled than another by the same
emotion or when we are comparing the various emotions of the same man one
with another and find that he is more affected or stirred by one emotion
than by another For the strength of every emotion is defined by a
comparison of our own power with the power of an external cause Now the
power of the mind is defined by knowledge only and its infirmity or passion
is defined by the privation of knowledge only it therefore follows that
that mind is most passive whose greatest part is made up of inadequate
ideas so that it may be characterized more readily by its passive states
than by its activities on the other hand that mind is most active whose
greatest part is made up of adequate ideas so that although it may contain
as many inadequate ideas as the former mind it may yet be more easily
characterized by ideas attributable to human virtue than by ideas which
tell of human infirmity Again it must be observed that spiritual
unhealthiness and misfortunes can generally be traced to excessive love for
something which is subject to many variations and which we can never become
masters of For no one is solicitous or anxious about anything unless he
loves it neither do wrongs suspicions enmities c arise except in
regard to things whereof no one can be really master

We may thus readily conceive the power which clear and distinct knowledge
and especially that third kind of knowledge IIxlviiNote founded on the
actual knowledge of God possesses over the emotions if it does not
absolutely destroy them in so far as they are passions Viii and
VivNote at any rate it causes them to occupy a very small part of the
mind Vxiv Further it begets a love towards a thing immutable and
eternal Vxv whereof we may really enter into possession IIxlv
neither can it be defiled with those faults which are inherent in ordinary
love but it may grow from strength to strength and may engross the greater
part of the mind and deeply penetrate it And now I have finished with all
that concerns this present life for as I said in the beginning of this
note I have briefly described all the remedies against the emotions And
this everyone may readily have seen for himself if he has attended to
what is advanced in the present note and also to the definitions of the
mind and its emotions and lastly to Propositions IIIi and IIIiii It
is now therefore time to pass on to those matters which appertain to the
duration of the mind without relation to the body


Prop XXI The mind can only imagine anything
or remember what is past while the body endures

Proof The mind does not express the actual existence of its body nor does
it imagine the modifications of the body as actual except while the body
endures IIviiiCoroll and consequently IIxxvi it does not imagine
any body as actually existing except while its own body endures Thus it
cannot imagine anything for definition of Imagination see IIxviiNote
or remember things past except while the body endures see definition of
Memory IIxviiiNote QED


Prop XXII Nevertheless in God there is necessarily an idea
which expresses the essence of this or that human body under
the form of eternity

Proof God is the cause not only of the existence of this or that human
body but also of its essence Ixxv This essence therefore must
necessarily be conceived through the very essence of God IAxiv and be
thus conceived by a certain eternal necessity Ixvi and this conception
must necessarily exist in God IIiii QED


Prop XXIII The human mind cannot be absolutely
destroyed with the body but there remains of it
something which is eternal

Proof There is necessarily in God a concept or idea which expresses the
essence of the human body last Prop which therefore is necessarily
something appertaining to the essence of the human mind IIxiii But we
have not assigned to the human mind any duration definable by time except
in so far as it expresses the actual existence of the body which is
explained through duration and may be defined by time  that is
IIviiiCoroll we do not assign to it duration except while the body
endures Yet as there is something notwithstanding which is conceived by
a certain eternal necessity through the very essence of God last Prop
this something which appertains to the essence of the mind will
necessarily be eternal QED

Note This idea which expresses the essence of the body under the form of
eternity is as we have said a certain mode of thinking which belongs to
the essence of the mind and is necessarily eternal Yet it is not possible
that we should remember that we existed before our body for our body can
bear no trace of such existence neither can eternity be defined in terms of
time or have any relation to time But notwithstanding we feel and know
that we are eternal For the mind feels those things that it conceives by
understanding no less than those things that it remembers For the eyes of
the mind whereby it sees and observes things are none other than proofs
Thus although we do not remember that we existed before the body yet we
feel that our mind in so far as it involves the essence of the body under
the form of eternity is eternal and that thus its existence cannot be
defined in terms of time or explained through duration Thus our mind can
only be said to endure and its existence can only be defined by a fixed
time in so far as it involves the actual existence of the body Thus far
only has it the power of determining the existence of things by time and
conceiving them under the category of duration


Prop XXIV The more we understand particular
things the more do we understand God

Proof This is evident from IxxvCoroll


Prop XXV The highest endeavour of the mind
and the highest virtue is to understand things
by the third kind of knowledge

Proof The third kind of knowledge proceeds from an adequate idea of
certain attributes of God to an adequate knowledge of the essence of things
see its definition IIIxlNoteii and in proportion as we understand
things more in this way we better understand God by the last Prop
therefore IVxxviii the highest virtue of the mind that is IVDefviii
the power or nature or IIIvii highest endeavour of the mind is to
understand things by the third kind of knowledge QED


Prop XXVI In proportion as the mind is
more capable of understanding things by
the third kind of knowledge it desires
more to understand things by that kind

Proof This is evident For in so far as we conceive the mind to be
capable of conceiving things by this kind of knowledge we to that extent
conceive it as determined thus to conceive things and consequently Def of
the Emotionsi the mind desires so to do in proportion as it is more
capable thereof QED


Prop XXVII From this third kind of
knowledge arises the highest possible
mental acquiescence

Proof The highest virtue of the mind is to know God IVxxviii or to
understand things by the third kind of knowledge Vxxv and this virtue
is greater in proportion as the mind knows things more by the said kind of
knowledge Vxxiv consequently he who knows things by this kind of
knowledge passes to the summit of human perfection and is therefore
Def of the Emotionsii affected by the highest pleasure such pleasure
being accompanied by the idea of himself and his own virtue thus Def of
the Emotionsxxv from this kind of knowledge arises the highest possible
acquiescence QED


Prop XXVIII The endeavour or desire to
know things by the third kind of knowledge
cannot arise from the first but from the
second kind of knowledge

Proof This proposition is selfevident For whatsoever we understand
clearly and distinct we understand either through itself or through that
which is conceived through itself that is ideas which are clear and
distinct in us or which are referred to the third kind of knowledge
IIxlNoteii cannot follow from ideas that are fragmentary and
confused and are referred to knowledge of the first kind but must follow
from adequate ideas or ideas of the second and third kind of knowledge
therefore Def of the Emotionsi the desire of knowing things by the
third kind of knowledge cannot arise from the first but from the second
kind QED


Prop XXIX Whatsoever the mind understands
under the form of eternity it does not
understand by virtue of conceiving the
present actual existence of the body
but by virtue of conceiving the essence of
the body under the form of eternity

Proof In so far as the mind conceives the present existence of its body
it to that extent conceives duration which can be determined by time and to
that extent only has it the power of conceiving things in relation to time
Vxxi IIxxvi But eternity cannot be explained in terms of duration
IDefviii and explanation Therefore to this extent the mind has not the
power of conceiving things under the form of eternity but it possesses such
power because it is of the nature of reason to conceive things under the
form of eternity IIxlivCorollii and also because it is of the nature
of the mind to conceive the essence of the body under the form of eternity
Vxxiii for besides these two there is nothing which belongs to the
essence of mind IIxiii Therefore this power of conceiving things under
the form of eternity only belongs to the mind in virtue of the minds
conceiving the essence of the body under the form of eternity QED

Note Things are conceived by us as actual in two ways either as existing
in relation to a given time and place or as contained in God and following
from the necessity of the divine nature Whatsoever we conceive in this
second way as true or real we conceive under the form of eternity and
their ideas involve the eternal and infinite essence of God as we showed
in IIxlvNote which see


Prop XXX Our mind in so far as it knows itself and the body
under the form of eternity has to that extent necessarily a
knowledge of God and knows that it is in God and is conceived
through God

Proof Eternity is the very essence of God in so far as this involves
necessary existence IDefviii Therefore to conceive things under the
form of eternity is to conceive things in so far as they are conceived
through thp essence of God as real entities or in so far as they involve
existence through the essence of God wherefore our mind in so far as it
conceives itself and the body under the form of eternity has to that extent
necessarily a knowledge of God and knows c QED


Prop XXXI The third kind of knowledge
depends on the mind as its formal cause
in so far as the mind itself is eternal

Proof The mind does not conceive anything under the form of eternity
except in so far as it conceives its own body under the form of eternity
Vxxix that is except in so far as it is eternal Vxxi Vxxiii
therefore by the last Prop in so far as it is eternal it possesses the
knowledge of God which knowledge is necessarily adequate
IIxlvi hence the mind in so far as it is eternal is capable of
knowing everything which can follow from this given knowledge of God
IIxl in other words of knowing things by the third kind of knowledge
see Def in IIxlNoteii whereof accordingly the mind IIIDefi in
so far as it is eternal is the adequate or formal cause of such knowledge
QED

Note In proportion therefore as a man is more potent in this kind of
knowledge he will be more completely conscious of himself and of God in
other words he will be more perfect and blessed as will appear more
clearly in the sequel But we must here observe that although we are
already certain that the mind is eternal in so far as it conceives things
under the form of eternity yet in order that what we wish to show may be
more readily explained and better understood we will consider the mind
itself as though it had just begun to exist and to understand things under
the form of eternity as indeed we have done hitherto this we may do
without any danger of error so long as we are careful not to draw any
conclusion unless our premisses are plain


Prop XXXII Whatsoever we understand by the third kind of
knowledge we take delight in and our delight is accompanied by
the idea of God as cause

Proof From this kind of knowledge arises the highest possible mental
acquiescence that is Def of the Emotionsxxv pleasure and this
acquiescence is accompanied by the idea of the mind itself V xxvii and
consequently Vxxx the idea also of God as cause QED

Corollary From the third kind of knowledge necessarily arises the
intellectual love of God From this kind of knowledge arises pleasure
accompanied by the idea of God as cause that is Def of the Emotionsvi
the love of God not in so far as we imagine him as present Vxxix but
in so far as we understand him to be eternal this is what I call the
intellectual love of God


Prop XXXIII The intellectual love of God
which arises from the third kind of knowledge
is eternal

Proof The third kind of knowledge is eternal Vxxxi IAxiii
therefore by the same Axiom the love which arises therefrom is also
necessarily eternal QED

Note Although this love towards God has by the foregoing Prop no
beginning it yet possesses all the perfections of love just as though it
had arisen as we feigned in the Coroll of the last Prop Nor is there here
any difference except that the mind possesses as eternal those same
perfections which we feigned to accrue to it and they are accompanied by
the idea of God as eternal cause If pleasure consists in the transition to
a greater perfection assuredly blessedness must consist in the mind being
endowed with perfection itself


Prop XXXIV The mind is only while the body
endures subject to those emotions which are
attributable to passions

Proof Imagination is the idea wherewith the mind contemplates a thing as
present IIxviiNote yet this idea indicates rather the present
disposition of the human body than the nature of the external thing
IIxviCorollii Therefore emotion see general Def of Emotions
is imagination in so far as it indicates the present disposition of the
body therefore Vxxi the mind is only while the body endures subject
to emotions which are attributable to passions QED

Corollary Hence it follows that no love save intellectual love is eternal

Note If we look to mens general opinion we shall see that they are
indeed conscious of the eternity of their mind but that they confuse
eternity with duration and ascribe it to the imagination or the memory
which they believe to remain after death


Prop XXXV God loves himself with
an infinite intellectual love

Proof God is absolutely infinite IDefvi that is IIDefvi the
nature of God rejoices in infinite perfection and such rejoicing is
IIiii accompanied by the idea of himself that is Ixi and IDefi
the idea of his own cause now this is what we have in VxxxiiCoroll
described as intellectual love


Prop XXXVI The intellectual love of the mind towards God is
that very love of God whereby God loves himself not in so far as
he is infinite but in so far as he can be explained through
the essence of the human mind regarded under the form of
eternity in other words the intellectual love of the mind towards
God is part of the infinite love wherewith God loves himself

Proof 1 This love of the mind must be referred to the activities of the
mind VxxxiiCoroll and IIIiii it is itself indeed an activity
whereby the mind regards itself accompanied by the idea of God as cause
VxxxiiCoroll that is IxxvCoroll and IIxiCoroll an activity
whereby God in so far as he can be explained through the human mind
regards himself accompanied by the idea of himself therefore by the last
Prop this love of the mind is part of the infinite love wherewith God
loves himself QED

Corollary Hence it follows that God in so far as he loves himself loves
man and consequently that the love of God towards men and the
intellectual love of the mind towards God are identical

Note From what has been said we clearly understand wherein our salvation
or blessedness or freedom consists namely in the constant and eternal
love towards God or in Gods love towards men This love or blessedness is
in the Bible called Glory and not undeservedly For whether this love be
referred to God or to the mind it may rightly be called acquiescence of
spirit which Def of the Emotionsxxv and xxx is not really
distinguished from glory In so far as it is referred to God it is
Vxxxv pleasure if we may still use that term accompanied by the idea
of itself and in so far as it is referred to the mind it is the same
Vxxvii

Again since the essence of our mind consists solely in knowledge whereof
the beginning and the foundation is God Ixv IIxlviiNote it becomes
clear to us in what manner and way our mind as to its essence and
existence follows from the divine nature and constantly depends on God I
have thought it worth while here to call attention to this in order to show
by this example how the knowledge of particular things which I have called
intuitive or of the third kind IIxlNoteii is potent and more
powerful than the universal knowledge which I have styled knowledge of the
second kind For although in Part I showed in general terms that all
things and consequently also the human mind depend as to their essence
and existence on God yet that demonstration though legitimate and placed
beyond the chances of doubt does not affect our mind so much as when the
same conclusion is derived from the actual essence of some particular thing
which we say depends on God


Prop XXXVII There is nothing in nature
which is contrary to this intellectual love
or which can take it away

Proof This intellectual love follows necessarily from the nature of the
mind in so far as the latter is regarded through the nature of God as an
eternal truth Vxxxiii and Vxxix If therefore there should be
anything which would be contrary to this love that thing would be
contrary to that which is true consequently that which should be able to
take away this love would cause that which is true to be false an obvious
absurdity Therefore there is nothing in nature which c QED

Note The Axiom of Part IV has reference to particular things in so far
as they are regarded in relation to a given time and place of this I
think no one can doubt


Prop XXXVIII In proportion as the mind understands more
things by the second and third kind of knowledge it is less
subject to those emotions which are evil and stands in less
fear of death

Proof The minds essence consists in knowledge IIxi therefore in
proportion as the mind understands more things by the second and third kinds
of knowledge the greater will be the part of it that endures Vxxix and
Vxxiii and consequently by the last Prop the greater will be the
part that is not touched by the emotions which are contrary to our nature
or in other words evil IVxxx Thus in proportion as the mind
understands more things by the second and third kinds of knowledge the
greater will be the part of it that remains unimpaired and consequently
less subject to emotions c QED

Note Hence we understand that point which I touched on in IVxxxixNote
and which I promised to explain in this Part namely that death becomes
less hurtful in proportion as the minds clear and distinct knowledge is
greater and consequently in proportion as the mind loves God more Again
since from the third kind of knowledge arises the highest possible
acquiescence Vxxvii it follows that the human mind can attain to
being of such a nature that the part thereof which we have shown to
perish with the body Vxxi should be of little importance when compared
with the part which endures But I will soon treat of the subject at greater
length


Prop XXXIX He who possesses a body capable
of the greatest number of activities possesses
a mind whereof the greatest part is eternal

Proof He who possesses a body capable of the greatest number of
activities is least agitated by those emotions which are evil IVxxxviii
that is IVxxx by those emotions which are contrary to our nature
therefore Vx he possesses the power of arranging and associating the
modifications of the body according to the intellectual order and
consequently of bringing it about that all the modifications of the body
should be referred to the idea of God whence it will come to pass that
Vxv he will be affected with love towards God which Vxvi must occupy
or constitute the chief part of the mind therefore Vxxxiii such a man
will possess a mind whereof the chief part is eternal QED

Note Since human bodies are capable of the greatest number of activities
there is no doubt but that they may be of such a nature that they may be
referred to minds possessing a great knowledge of themselves and of God and
whereof the greatest or chief part is eternal and therefore that they
should scarcely fear death But in order that this may be understood more
clearly we must here call to mind that we live in a state of perpetual
variation and according as we are changed for the better or the worse we
are called happy or unhappy

For he who from being an infant or a child becomes a corpse is called
unhappy whereas it is set down to happiness if we have been able to live
through the whole period of life with a sound mind in a sound body And in
reality he who as in the case of an infant or a child has a body capable
of very few activities and depending for the most part on external
causes has a mind which considered in itself alone is scarcely conscious
of itself or of God or of things whereas he who has a body capable of
very many activities has a mind which considered in itself alone is
highly conscious of itself of God and of things In this life therefore
we primarily endeavour to bring it about that the body of a child in so
far as its nature allows and conduces thereto may be changed into something
else capable of very many activities and referable to a mind which is
highly conscious of itself of God and of things and we desire so to
change it that what is referred to its imagination and memory may become
insignificant in comparison with its intellect as I have already said in
the note to the last Proposition


Prop XL In proportion as each thing possesses
more of perfection so is it more active and
less passive and vice versa in proportion as
it is more active so is it more perfect

Proof In proportion as each thing is more perfect it possesses more of
reality IIDefvi and consequently IIIiiiand Note it is to that
extent more active and less passive This demonstration may be reversed and
thus prove that in proportion as a thing is more active so is it more
perfect QED

Corollary Hence it follows that the part of the mind which endures be it
great or small is more perfect than the rest For the eternal part of the
mind Vxiii and Vxxix the understanding through which alone we are
said to act IIIiii the part which we have shown to perish is the
imagination Vxxi through which only we are said to be passive IIIiii
and general Def of the Emotions therefore the former be it great or
small is more perfect than the latter QED

Note Such are the doctrines which I had purposed to set forth concerning
the mind in so far as it is regarded without relation to the body whence
as also from Ixxi and other places it is plain that our mind in so far
as it understands is an eternal mode of thinking which is determined by
another eternal mode of thinking and this other by a third and so on to
infinity so that all taken together at once constitute the eternal and
infinite intellect of God


Prop XLI Even if we did not know that
our mind is eternal we should still
consider as of primary importance piety
and religion and generally all things
which in Part IV we showed to be
attributable to courage and highmindedness

Proof The first and only foundation of virtue or the rule of right
living is IVxxiiCoroll and IVxxiv seeking ones own true interest
Now while we determined what reason prescribes as useful we took no
account of the minds eternity which has only become known to us in this
Fifth Part Although we were ignorant at that time that the mind is eternal
we nevertheless stated that the qualities attributable to courage and high
mindedness are of primary importance Therefore even if we were still
ignorant of this doctrine we should yet put the aforesaid precepts of
reason in the first place QED

Note The general belief of the multitude seems to be different Most
people seem to believe that they are free in so far as they may obey their
lusts and that they cede their rights in so far as they are bound to live
according to the commandments of the divine law They therefore believe that
piety religion and generally all things attributable to firmness of
mind are burdens which after death they hope to lay aside and to
receive the reward for their bondage that is for their piety and
religion it is not only by this hope but also and chiefly by the fear of
being horribly punished after death that they are induced to live according
to the divine commandments so far as their feeble and infirm spirit will
carry them

If men had not this hope and this fear but believed that the mind perishes
with the body and that no hope of prolonged life remains for the wretches
who are broken down with the burden of piety they would return to their own
inclinations controlling everything in accordance with their lusts and
desiring to obey fortune rather than themselves Such a course appears to me
not less absurd than if a man because he does not believe that he can by
wholesome food sustain his body for ever should wish to cram himself with
poisons and deadly fare or if because he sees that the mind is not eternal
or immortal he should prefer to be out of his mind altogether and to live
without the use of reason these ideas are so absurd as to be scarcely worth
refuting


Prop XLII Blessedness is not the reward of virtue but virtue
itself  neither do we rejoice therein because we control our
lusts but contrariwise because we rejoice therein we are able
to control our lusts

Proof Blessedness consists in love towards God Vxxxvi and Note which
love springs from the third kind of knowledge VxxxiiCoroll therefore
this love IIIiii and IIIlix must be referred to the mind in so far as
the latter is active therefore IVDefviii it is virtue itself
This was our first point Again in proportion as the mind rejoices more in
this divine love or blessedness so does it the more understand Vxxxii
that is ViiiCoroll so much the more power has it over the emotions
and Vxxxviii so much the less is it subject to those emotions
which are evil therefore in proportion as the mind rejoices in this divine
love or blessedness so has it the power of controlling lusts And since
human power in controlling the emotions consists solely in the
understanding it follows that no one rejoices in blessedness because he
has controlled his lusts but contrariwise his power of controlling his
lusts arises from this blessedness itself QED

Note I have thus completed all I wished to set forth touching the minds
power over the emotions and the minds freedom Whence it appears how
potent is the wise man and how much he surpasses the ignorant man who is
driven only by his lusts For the ignorant man is not only distracted in
various ways by external causes without ever gaining the true acquiescence
of his spirit but moreover lives as it were unwitting of himself and of
God and of things and as soon as he ceases to suffer ceases also to be

Whereas the wise man in so far as he is regarded as such is scarcely at
all disturbed in spirit but being conscious of himself and of God and of
things by a certain eternal necessity never ceases to be but always
possesses true acquiescence of his spirit

If the way which I have pointed out as leading to this result seems
exceedingly hard it may nevertheless be discovered Needs must it be hard
since it is so seldom found How would it be possible if salvation were
ready to our hand and could without great labour be found that it should
be by almost all men neglected But all things excellent are as
difficult as they are rare

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
To donate please visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate


Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 wwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
