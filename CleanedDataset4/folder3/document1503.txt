Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

King Richard the Third

ACT I

SCENE I London A street

Enter GLOSTER

GLOSTER
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York
And all the clouds that lourd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments
Our stern alarums changd to merry meetings
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
Grimvisagd war hath smoothd his wrinkled front
And nowinstead of mounting barbed steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries
He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute
But Ithat am not shapd for sportive tricks
Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
I that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph
I that am curtaild of this fair proportion
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature
Deformd unfinishd sent before my time
Into this breathing world scarce half made up
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them
Why I in this weak piping time of peace
Have no delight to pass away the time
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity
And thereforesince I cannot prove a lover
To entertain these fair wellspoken days
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days
Plots have I laid inductions dangerous
By drunken prophecies libels and dreams
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle false and treacherous
This day should Clarence closely be mewd up
About a prophecy which says that G
Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be
Dive thoughts down to my soulhere Clarence comes

Enter CLARENCE guarded and BRAKENBURY

Brother good day what means this armed guard
That waits upon your grace

CLARENCE
His majesty
Tendering my persons safety hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower

GLOSTER
Upon what cause

CLARENCE
Because my name is George

GLOSTER
Alack my lord that fault is none of yours
He should for that commit your godfathers
O belike his majesty hath some intent
That you should be newchristend in the Tower
But whats the matter Clarence may I know

CLARENCE
Yea Richard when I know for I protest
As yet I do not but as I can learn
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams
And from the crossrow plucks the letter G
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be
And for my name of George begins with G
It follows in his thought that I am he
These as I learn and such like toys as these
Hath movd his highness to commit me now

GLOSTER
Why this it is when men are ruld by women
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower
My Lady Grey his wife Clarence tis she
That tempers him to this extremity
Was it not she and that good man of worship
Antony Woodville her brother there
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower
From whence this present day he is deliverd
We are not safe Clarence we are not safe

CLARENCE
By heaven I think there is no man is secure
But the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore
Heard you not what an humble suppliant
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery

GLOSTER
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty
Ill tell you whatI think it is our way
If we will keep in favour with the king
To be her men and wear her livery
The jealous oerworn widow and herself
Since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen
Are mighty gossips in our monarchy

BRAKENBURY
I beseech your graces both to pardon me
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference
Of what degree soever with your brother

GLOSTER
Even so ant please your worship Brakenbury
You may partake of any thing we say
We speak no treason manwe say the king
Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
Well struck in years fair and not jealous
We say that Shores wife hath a pretty foot
A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
And that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks
How say you sir can you deny all this

BRAKENBURY
With this my lord myself have naught to do

GLOSTER
Naught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee fellow
He that doth naught with her excepting one
Were best to do it secretly alone

BRAKENBURY
What one my lord

GLOSTER
Her husband knavewouldst thou betray me

BRAKENBURY
I do beseech your grace to pardon me and withal
Forbear your conference with the noble duke

CLARENCE
We know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey

GLOSTER
We are the queens abjects and must obey
Brother farewell I will unto the king
And whatsoeer you will employ me in
Were it to call King Edwards widow sister
I will perform it to enfranchise you
Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine

CLARENCE
I know it pleaseth neither of us well

GLOSTER
Well your imprisonment shall not be long
I will deliver or else lie for you
Meantime have patience

CLARENCE
I must perforce farewell

Exeunt CLARENCE BRAKENBURY and guard

GLOSTER
Go tread the path that thou shalt neer return
Simple plain ClarenceI do love thee so
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven
If heaven will take the present at our hands
But who comes here The newdelivered Hastings

Enter HASTINGS

HASTINGS
Good time of day unto my gracious lord

GLOSTER
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain
Well are you welcome to the open air
How hath your lordship brookd imprisonment

HASTINGS
With patience noble lord as prisoners must
But I shall live my lord to give them thanks
That were the cause of my imprisonment

GLOSTER
No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too
For they that were your enemies are his
And have prevaild as much on him as you

HASTINGS
More pity that the eagles should be mewd
Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty

GLOSTER
What news abroad

HASTINGS
No news so bad abroad as this at home
The king is sickly weak and melancholy
And his physicians fear him mightily

GLOSTER
Now by Saint Paul that news is bad indeed
O he hath kept an evil diet long
And overmuch consumd his royal person
Tis very grievous to be thought upon
What is he in his bed

HASTINGS
He is

GLOSTER
Go you before and I will follow you

Exit HASTINGS

He cannot live I hope and must not die
Till George be packd with posthorse up to heaven
Ill in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
With lies well steeld with weighty arguments
And if I fail not in my deep intent
Clarence hath not another day to live
Which done God take King Edward to his mercy
And leave the world for me to bustle in
For then Ill marry Warwicks youngest daughter
What though I killd her husband and her father
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father
The which will I not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent
By marrying her which I must reach unto
But yet I run before my horse to market
Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns
When they are gone then must I count my gains

Exit



SCENE II London Another street

Enter the corpse of King Henry the Sixth borne in an open
coffin Gentlemen bearing halberds to guard it and Lady
Anne as mourner

ANNE
Set down set down your honourable load
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
Th untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster
Poor keycold figure of a holy king
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
To hear the lamentations of poor Anne
Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughterd son
Stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds
Lo in these windows that let forth thy life
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
O cursed be the hand that made these holes
Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
More direful hap betide that hated wretch
That makes us wretched by the death of thee
Than I can wish to adders spiders toads
Or any creeping venomd thing that lives
If ever he have child abortive be it
Prodigious and untimely brought to light
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view
And that be heir to his unhappiness
If ever he have wife let her be made
More miserable by the death of him
Than I am made by my young lord and thee
Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load
Taken from Pauls to be interred there
And still as you are weary of this weight
Rest you whiles I lament King Henrys corse

The Bearers take up the Corpse and advance

Enter GLOSTER

GLOSTER
Stay you that bear the corse and set it down

ANNE
What black magician conjures up this fiend
To stop devoted charitable deeds

GLOSTER
Villains set down the corse or by Saint Paul
Ill make a corse of him that disobeys

FIRST GENTLEMAN
My lord stand back and let the coffin pass

GLOSTER
Unmannerd dog stand thou when I command
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast
Or by Saint Paul Ill strike thee to my foot
And spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness

The Bearers set down the coffin

ANNE
What do you tremble are you all afraid
Alas I blame you not for you are mortal
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body
His soul thou canst not have therefore be gone

GLOSTER
Sweet saint for charity be not so curst

ANNE
Foul devil for Gods sake hence and trouble us not
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
Filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries
O gentlemen see see dead Henrys wounds
Open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh
Blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
For tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
Provokes this deluge most unnatural
O God which this blood madst revenge his death
O earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead
Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
As thou dost swallow up this good kings blood
Which his hellgovernd arm hath butchered

GLOSTER
Lady you know no rules of charity
Which renders good for bad blessings for curses

ANNE
Villain thou knowest nor law of God nor man
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity

GLOSTER
But I know none and therefore am no beast

ANNE
O wonderful when devils tell the truth

GLOSTER
More wonderful when angels are so angry
Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
By circumstance but to acquit myself

ANNE
Vouchsafe diffusd infection of a man
Of these known evils but to give me leave
By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self

GLOSTER
Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself

ANNE
Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
No excuse current but to hang thyself

GLOSTER
By such despair I should accuse myself

ANNE
And by despairing shalt thou stand excusd
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
That didst unworthy slaughter upon others

GLOSTER
Say that I slew them not

ANNE
Then say they were not slain
But dead they are and devilish slave by thee

GLOSTER
I did not kill your husband

ANNE
Why then he is alive

GLOSTER
Nay he is dead and slain by Edwards hand

ANNE
In thy foul throat thou liest Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood
The which thou once didst bend against her breast
But that thy brothers beat aside the point

GLOSTER
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue
That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders

ANNE
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
That never dreamt on aught but butcheries
Didst thou not kill this king

GLOSTER
I grant ye

ANNE
Dost grant me hedgehog then God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
O he was gentle mild and virtuous

GLOSTER
The better for the king of Heaven that hath him

ANNE
He is in heaven where thou shalt never come

GLOSTER
Let him thank me that holp to send him thither
For he was fitter for that place than earth

ANNE
And thou unfit for any place but hell

GLOSTER
Yes one place else if you will hear me name it

ANNE
Some dungeon

GLOSTER
Your bedchamber

ANNE
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest

GLOSTER
So will it madam till I lie with you

ANNE
I hope so

GLOSTER
I know soBut gentle Lady Anne
To leave this keen encounter of our wits
And fall something into a slower method
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward
As blameful as the executioner

ANNE
Thou wast the cause and most accursd effect

GLOSTER
Your beauty was the cause of that effect
Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom

ANNE
If I thought that I tell thee homicide
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks

GLOSTER
These eyes could not endure that beautys wreck
You should not blemish it if I stood by
As all the world is cheered by the sun
So I by that it is my day my life

ANNE
Black night oershade thy day and death thy life

GLOSTER
Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both

ANNE
I would I were to be revengd on thee

GLOSTER
It is a quarrel most unnatural
To be revengd on him that loveth thee

ANNE
It is a quarrel just and reasonable
To be revengd on him that killd my husband

GLOSTER
He that bereft thee lady of thy husband
Did it to help thee to a better husband

ANNE
His better doth not breathe upon the earth

GLOSTER
He lives that loves thee better than he could

ANNE
Name him

GLOSTER
Plantagenet

ANNE
Why that was he

GLOSTER
The selfsame name but one of better nature

ANNE
Where is he

GLOSTER
Here

She spits at him

Why dost thou spit at me

ANNE
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake

GLOSTER
Never came poison from so sweet a place

ANNE
Never hung poison on a fouler toad
Out of my sight thou dost infect mine eyes

GLOSTER
Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine

ANNE
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead

GLOSTER
I would they were that I might die at once
For now they kill me with a living death
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
Shamd their aspects with store of childish drops
These eyes which never shed remorseful tear
No when my father York and Edward wept
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When blackfacd Clifford shook his sword at him
Nor when thy warlike father like a child
Told the sad story of my fathers death
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
That all the standersby had wet their cheeks
Like trees bedashd with rain in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
I never sud to friend nor enemy
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
But now thy beauty is proposd my fee
My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak

She looks scornfully at him

Teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made
For kissing lady not for such contempt
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
Lo here I lend thee this sharppointed sword
Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke
And humbly beg the death upon my knee
Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry

He lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword

But twas thy beauty that provoked me
Nay now dispatch twas I that stabbd young Edward

She again offers at his breast

But twas thy heavenly face that set me on

She lets fall the sword

Take up the sword again or take up me

ANNE
Arise dissembler though I wish thy death
I will not be thy executioner

GLOSTER
Then bid me kill myself and I will do it

ANNE
I have already

GLOSTER
That was in thy rage
Speak it again and even with the word
This hand which for thy love did kill thy love
Shall for thy love kill a far truer love
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary

ANNE
I would I knew thy heart

GLOSTER
Tis figured in my tongue

ANNE
I fear me both are false

GLOSTER
Then never was man true

ANNE
Well well put up your sword

GLOSTER
Say then my peace is made

ANNE
That shalt thou know hereafter

GLOSTER
But shall I live in hope

ANNE
All men I hope live so

GLOSTER
Vouchsafe to wear this ring

ANNE
To take is not to give

She puts on the ring

GLOSTER
Look how this ring encompasseth thy finger
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
Wear both of them for both of them are thine
And if thy poor devoted servant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever

ANNE
What is it

GLOSTER
That it may please you leave these sad designs
To him that hath most cause to be a mourner
And presently repair to Crosby Place
Whereafter I have solemnly interrd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king
And wet his grave with my repentant tears
I will with all expedient duty see you
For divers unknown reasons I beseech you
Grant me this boon

ANNE
With all my heart and much it joys me too
To see you are become so penitent
Tressel and Berkeley go along with me

GLOSTER
Bid me farewell

ANNE
Tis more than you deserve
But since you teach me how to flatter you
Imagine I have said farewell already

Exeunt Lady Anne Tress and Berk

GLOSTER
Sirs take up the corse

GENTLEMEN
Towards Chertsey noble lord

GLOSTER
No to White Friars there attend my coming

Exeunt the rest with the Corpse

Was ever woman in this humour wood
Was ever woman in this humour won
Ill have her but I will not keep her long
What I that killd her husband and his father
To take her in her hearts extremest hate
With curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
The bleeding witness of her hatred by
Having God her conscience and these bars against me
And I no friends to back my suit withal
But the plain devil and dissembling looks
And yet to win herall the world to nothing
Ha
Hath she forgot already that brave prince
Edward her lord whom I some three months since
Stabbd in my angry mood at Tewksbury
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
Framd in the prodigality of nature
Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet abase her eyes on me
That croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince
And made her widow to a woeful bed
On me whose all not equals Edwards moiety
On me that halt and am misshapen thus
My dukedom to a beggarly denier
I do mistake my person all this while
Upon my life she finds although I cannot
Myself to be a marvellous proper man
Ill be at charges for a lookingglass
And entertain a score or two of tailors
To study fashions to adorn my body
Since I am crept in favour with myself
I will maintain it with some little cost
But first Ill turn yon fellow in his grave
And then return lamenting to my love
Shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass
That I may see my shadow as I pass

Exit



SCENE III London A Room in the Palace

QUEEN ELIZABETH
The loss of such a lord includes all harms

GREY
The heavens have blessd you with a goodly son
To be your comforter when he is gone

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ah he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloster
A man that loves not me nor none of you

RIVERS
Is it concluded he shall be protector

QUEEN ELIZABETH
It is determind not concluded yet
But so it must be if the king miscarry

Enter BUCKINGHAM and STANLEY

GREY
Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Stanley

BUCKINGHAM
Good time of day unto your royal grace

STANLEY
God make your majesty joyful as you have been

QUEEN ELIZABETH
The Countess Richmond good my Lord of Stanley
To your good prayer will scarcely say amen
Yet Stanley notwithstanding shes your wife
And loves not me be you good lord assurd
I hate not you for her proud arrogance

STANLEY
I do beseech you either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers
Or if she be accusd on true report
Bear with her weakness which I think proceeds
From wayward sickness and no grounded malice

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Saw you the king today my Lord of Stanley

STANLEY
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty

QUEEN ELIZABETH
What likelihood of his amendment lords

BUCKINGHAM
Madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully

QUEEN ELIZABETH
God grant him health Did you confer with him

BUCKINGHAM
Ay madam he desires to make atonement
Between the Duke of Gloster and your brothers
And between them and my lord chamberlain
And sent to warn them to his royal presence

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Would all were wellbut that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the height

Enter GLOSTER HASTINGS and DORSET

GLOSTER
They do me wrong and I will not endure it
Who are they that complain unto the king
That I forsooth am stern and love them not
By holy Paul they love his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
Because I cannot flatter and look fair
Smile in mens faces smooth deceive and cog
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy
I must be held a rancorous enemy
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
But thus his simple truth must be abusd
With silken sly insinuating Jacks

GREY
To who in all this presence speaks your grace

GLOSTER
To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
When have I injurd thee when done thee wrong
Or theeor theeor any of your faction
A plague upon you all His royal grace
Whom God preserve better than you would wish
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Brother of Gloster you mistake the matter
The king on his own royal disposition
And not provokd by any suitor else
Aiming belike at your interior hatred
That in your outward action shows itself
Against my children brothers and myself
Makes him to send that thereby he may gather
The ground of your illwill and so remove it

GLOSTER
I cannot tell the world is grown so bad
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
Since every Jack became a gentleman
Theres many a gentle person made a Jack

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Come come we know your meaning brother Gloster
You envy my advancement and my friends
God grant we never may have need of you

GLOSTER
Meantime God grants that we have need of you
Our brother is imprisond by your means
Myself disgracd and the nobility
Held in contempt while great promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce some two days since were worth a noble

QUEEN ELIZABETH
By Him that raisd me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoyd
I never did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him
My lord you do me shameful injury
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects

GLOSTER
You may deny that you were not the mean
Of my Lord Hastings late imprisonment

RIVERS
She may my lord for

GLOSTER
She may Lord Riverswhy who knows not so
She may do more sir than denying that
She may help you to many fair preferments
And then deny her aiding hand therein
And lay those honours on your high desert
What may she not She mayay marry may she

RIVERS
What marry may she

GLOSTER
What marry may she marry with a king
A bachelor and a handsome stripling too
I wis your grandam had a worser match

QUEEN ELIZABETH
My Lord of Gloster I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
By heaven I will acquaint his majesty
Of those gross taunts that oft I have endurd
I had rather be a country servantmaid
Than a great queen with this condition
To be so baited scornd and stormed at

Enter old QUEEN MARGARET behind

Small joy have I in being Englands queen

QUEEN MARGARET
And lessend be that small God I beseech Him
Thy honour state and seat is due to me

GLOSTER
What Threat you me with telling of the king
Tell him and spare not look what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower
Tis time to speakmy pains are quite forgot

QUEEN MARGARET
Out devil I do remember them too well
Thou killdst my husband Henry in the Tower
And Edward my poor son at Tewksbury

GLOSTER
Ere you were queen ay or your husband king
I was a packhorse in his great affairs
A weederout of his proud adversaries
A liberal rewarder of his friends
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own

QUEEN MARGARET
Ay and much better blood than his or thine

GLOSTER
In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster
And Rivers so were you was not your husband
In Margarets battle at Saint Albans slain
Let me put in your minds if you forget
What you have been ere this and what you are
Withal what I have been and what I am

QUEEN MARGARET
A murderous villain and so still thou art

GLOSTER
Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick
Ay and forswore himselfwhich Jesu pardon

QUEEN MARGARET
Which God revenge

GLOSTER
To fight on Edwards party for the crown
And for his meed poor lord he is mewd up
I would to God my heart were flint like Edwards
Or Edwards soft and pitiful like mine
I am too childishfoolish for this world

QUEEN MARGARET
Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this world
Thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is

RIVERS
My Lord of Gloster in those busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies
We followd then our lord our sovereign king
So should we you if you should be our king

GLOSTER
If I should beI had rather be a pedler
Far be it from my heart the thought thereof

QUEEN ELIZABETH
As little joy my lord as you suppose
You should enjoy were you this countrys king
As little joy you may suppose in me
That I enjoy being the queen thereof

QUEEN MARGARET
As little joy enjoys the queen thereof
For I am she and altogether joyless
I can no longer hold me patient

Advancing

Hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
In sharing that which you have pilld from me
Which of you trembles not that looks on me
If not that I am queen you bow like subjects
Yet that by you deposd you quake like rebels
Ah gentle villain do not turn away

GLOSTER
Foul wrinkled witch what makst thou in my sight

QUEEN MARGARET
But repetition of what thou hast marrd
That will I make before I let thee go

GLOSTER
Wert thou not banished on pain of death

QUEEN MARGARET
I was but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode
A husband and a son thou owst to me
And thou a kingdomall of you allegiance
This sorrow that I have by right is yours
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine

GLOSTER
The curse my noble father laid on thee
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
And with thy scorns drewst rivers from his eyes
And then to dry them gavst the Duke a clout
Steepd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland
His curses then from bitterness of soul
Denouncd against thee are all fallen upon thee
And God not we hath plagud thy bloody deed

QUEEN ELIZABETH
So just is God to right the innocent

HASTINGS
O twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
And the most merciless that eer was heard of

RIVERS
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported

DORSET
No man but prophesied revenge for it

BUCKINGHAM
Northumberland then present wept to see it

QUEEN MARGARET
What were you snarling all before I came
Ready to catch each other by the throat
And turn you all your hatred now on me
Did Yorks dread curse prevail so much with heaven
That Henrys death my lovely Edwards death
Their kingdoms loss my woeful banishment
Should all but answer for that peevish brat
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
Why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
Though not by war by surfeit die your king
As ours by murder to make him a king
Edward thy son that now is Prince of Wales
For Edward our son that was Prince of Wales
Die in his youth by like untimely violence
Thyself a queen for me that was a queen
Outlive thy glory like my wretched self
Long mayest thou live to wail thy childrens death
And see another as I see thee now
Deckd in thy rights as thou art stalld in mine
Long die thy happy days before thy death
And after many lengthend hours of grief
Die neither mother wife nor Englands queen
Rivers and Dorset you were standers by
And so wast thou Lord Hastingswhen my son
Was stabbd with bloody daggers God I pray Him
That none of you may live his natural age
But by some unlookd accident cut off

GLOSTER
Have done thy charm thou hateful witherd hag

QUEEN MARGARET
And leave out thee stay dog for thou shalt hear me
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee
O let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee the troubler of the poor worlds peace
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livst
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
Unless it be while some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
Thou elvishmarkd abortive rooting hog
Thou that wast seald in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell
Thou slander of thy heavy mothers womb
Thou loathed issue of thy fathers loins
Thou rag of honour thou detested

GLOSTER
Margaret

QUEEN MARGARET
Richard

GLOSTER
Ha

QUEEN MARGARET
I call thee not

GLOSTER
I cry thee mercy then for I did think
That thou hadst calld me all these bitter names

QUEEN MARGARET
Why so I did but lookd for no reply
O let me make the period to my curse

GLOSTER
Tis done by me and ends inMargaret

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Thus have you breathd your curse against yourself

QUEEN MARGARET
Poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune
Why strewst thou sugar on that bottled spider
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
Fool fool thou whettst a knife to kill thyself
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse this poisonous bunchbackd toad

HASTINGS
Falseboding woman end thy frantic curse
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience

QUEEN MARGARET
Foul shame upon you you have all movd mine

RIVERS
Were you well servd you would be taught your duty

QUEEN MARGARET
To serve me well you all should do me duty
Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
O serve me well and teach yourselves that duty

DORSET
Dispute not with hershe is lunatic

QUEEN MARGARET
Peace master marquis you are malapert
Your firenew stamp of honour is scarce current
O that your young nobility could judge
What twere to lose it and be miserable
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them
And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces

GLOSTER
Good counsel marrylearn it learn it marquis

DORSET
It touches you my lord as much as me

GLOSTER
Ay and much more but I was born so high
Our aery buildeth in the cedars top
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun

QUEEN MARGARET
And turns the sun to shadealas alas
Witness my son now in the shade of death
Whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up
Your aery buildeth in our aerys nest
O God that seest it do not suffer it
As it is won with blood lost be it so

BUCKINGHAM
Peace peace for shame if not for charity

QUEEN MARGARET
Urge neither charity nor shame to me
Uncharitably with me have you dealt
And shamefully my hopes by you are butcherd
My charity is outrage life my shame
And in that shame still live my sorrows rage

BUCKINGHAM
Have done have done

QUEEN MARGARET
O princely Buckingham Ill kiss thy hand
In sign of league and amity with thee
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood
Nor thou within the compass of my curse

BUCKINGHAM
Nor no one here for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air

QUEEN MARGARET
I will not think but they ascend the sky
And there awake Gods gentlesleeping peace
O Buckingham take heed of yonder dog
Look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
His venom tooth will rankle to the death
Have not to do with him beware of him
Sin death and hell have set their marks on him
And all their ministers attend on him

GLOSTER
What doth she say my Lord of Buckingham

BUCKINGHAM
Nothing that I respect my gracious lord

QUEEN MARGARET
What dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from
O but remember this another day
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess
Live each of you the subjects to his hate
And he to yours and all of you to Gods

Exit

BUCKINGHAM
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses

RIVERS
And so doth mine I muse why shes at liberty

GLOSTER
I cannot blame her by Gods holy mother
She hath had too much wrong and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her

QUEEN ELIZABETH
I never did her any to my knowledge

GLOSTER
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong
I was too hot to do somebody good
That is too cold in thinking of it now
Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid
He is frankd up to fatting for his pains
God pardon them that are the cause thereof

RIVERS
A virtuous and a Christianlike conclusion
To pray for them that have done scathe to us

GLOSTER
So do I ever being well advisd
Aside For had I cursd now I had cursd myself

Enter CATESBY

CATESBY
Madam his majesty doth can for you
And for your graceand you my noble lords

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Catesby I comeLords will you go with me

RIVERS
We wait upon your grace

Exeunt all but GLOSTER

GLOSTER
I do the wrong and first begin to brawl
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others
Clarencewhom I indeed have cast in darkness
I do beweep to many simple gulls
Namely to Stanley Hastings Buckingham
And tell them tis the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother
Now they believe it and withal whet me
To be revengd on Rivers Vaughn Grey
But then I sigh and with a piece of Scripture
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With odd old ends stoln forth of holy writ
And seem a saint when most I play the devil
But soft here come my executioners

Enter two MURDERERS

How now my hardy stout resolved mates
Are you now going to dispatch this thing

FIRST MURDERER
We are my lord and come to have the warrant
That we may be admitted where he is

GLOSTER
Well thought uponI have it here about me

Gives the warrant

When you have done repair to Crosby Place
But sirs be sudden in the execution
Withal obdurate do not hear him plead
For Clarence is wellspoken and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him

FIRST MURDERER
Tut tut my lord we will not stand to prate
Talkers are no good doers be assurd
We go to use our hands and not our tongues

GLOSTER
Your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes fall tears
I like you ladsabout your business straight
Go go despatch

FIRST MURDERER
We will my noble lord

Exeunt



SCENE IV London A Room in the Tower

Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY

BRAKENBURY
Why looks your grace so heavily today

CLARENCE
O I have passd a miserable night
So full of fearful dreams of ugly sights
That as I am a Christian faithful man
I would not spend another such a night
Though twere to buy a world of happy days
So full of dismal terror was the time

BRAKENBURY
What was your dream my lord I pray you tell me

CLARENCE
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
And was embarkd to cross to Burgundy
And in my company my brother Gloster
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches thence we lookd toward England
And cited up a thousand heavy times
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befalln us As we pacd along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches
Methought that Gloster stumbled and in falling
Struck me that thought to stay him overboard
Into the tumbling billows of the main
O Lord methought what pain it was to drown
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears
What sights of ugly death within my eyes
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks
A thousand men that fishes gnawd upon
Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
Inestimable stones unvalued jewels
All scattred in the bottom of the sea
Some lay in dead mens skulls and in the holes
Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
As twere in scorn of eyesreflecting gems
That wood the slimy bottom of the deep
And mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by

BRAKENBURY
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep

CLARENCE
Methought I had and often did I strive
To yield the ghost but still the envious flood
Stoppd in my soul and would not let it forth
To find the empty vast and wandering air
But smotherd it within my panting bulk
Who almost burst to belch it in the sea

BRAKENBURY
Awakd you not in this sore agony

CLARENCE
No no my dream was lengthend after life
O then began the tempest to my soul
I passd methought the melancholy flood
With that grim ferryman which poets write of
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night
The first that there did greet my stranger soul
Was my great fatherinlaw renowned Warwick
Who spake aloud What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence
And so he vanishd then came wandering by
A shadow like an Angel with bright hair
Dabbled in blood and he shriekd out aloud
Clarence is comefalse fleeting perjurd Clarence
That stabbd me in the field by Tewksbury
Seize on him Furies take him to your torments
With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
Environd me and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries that with the very noise
I trembling wakd and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell
Such terrible impression made my dream

BRAKENBURY
No marvel lord though it affrighted you
I am afraid methinks to hear you tell it

CLARENCE
Ah Brakenbury I have done these things
That now give evidence against my soul
For Edwards sake and see how he requites me
O God If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee
But Thou wilt be avengd on my misdeeds
Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone
O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
Keeper I prithee sit by me awhile
My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep

BRAKENBURY
I will my lord God give your grace good rest

CLARENCE reposes himself on a chair

Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
Makes the night morning and the noontide night
Princes have but their titles for their glories
An outward honour for an inward toil
And for unfelt imaginations
They often feel a world of restless cares
So that between their tides and low name
Theres nothing differs but the outward fame

Enter the two MURDERERS

FIRST MURDERER
Ho whos here

BRAKENBURY
What wouldst thou fellow and how camst thou hither

FIRST MURDERER
I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs

BRAKENBURY
What so brief

SECOND MURDERER
Tis better sir than to be tediousLet
him see our commission and talk no more

A paper is delivered to BRAKENBURY who reads it

BRAKENBURY
I am in this commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands
I will not reason what is meant hereby
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning
There lies the Duke asleepand there the keys
Ill to the king and signify to him
That thus I have resignd to you my charge

FIRST MURDERER
You may sir tis a point of wisdom fare you well

Exit BRAKENBURY

SECOND MURDERER
What shall we stab him as he sleeps

FIRST MURDERER
No hell say twas done cowardly when he wakes

SECOND MURDERER
When he wakes why fool he shall never wake until the great
judgmentday

FIRST MURDERER
Why then hell say we stabbd him sleeping

SECOND MURDERER
The urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in
me

FIRST MURDERER
What art thou afraid

SECOND MURDERER
Not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be damned
for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me

FIRST MURDERER
I thought thou hadst been resolute

SECOND MURDERER
So I am to let him live

FIRST MURDERER
Ill back to the Duke of Gloster and tell him so

SECOND MURDERER
Nay I prythee stay a little I hope my holy humour will
change it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty

FIRST MURDERER
How dost thou feel thyself now

SECOND MURDERER
Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me

FIRST MURDERER
Remember our reward when the deeds done

SECOND MURDERER
Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward

FIRST MURDERER
Wheres thy conscience now

SECOND MURDERER
O in the Duke of Glosters purse

FIRST MURDERER
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward
thy conscience flies out

SECOND MURDERER
Tis no matter let it go theres few or none will entertain it

FIRST MURDERER
What if it come to thee again

SECOND MURDERER
Ill not meddle with itit makes a man coward
a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man
cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his
neighbours wife but it detects him tis a blushing shame
faced spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom it fills a man
full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold
that by chance I found it beggars any man that keeps it
it is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing
and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
to himself and live without it

FIRST MURDERER
Zoundstis even now at my elbow persuading me
not to kill the duke

SECOND MURDERER
Take the devil in thy mind and believe him not he would
insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh

FIRST MURDERER
I am strongframed he cannot prevail with me

SECOND MURDERER
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation
Come shall we fall to work

FIRST MURDERER
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword
and then throw him in the malmseybutt in the next room

SECOND MURDERER
O excellent device and make a sop of him

FIRST MURDERER
Soft he wakes

SECOND MURDERER
Strike

FIRST MURDERER
No well reason with him

CLARENCE
Where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine

SECOND MURDERER
You shall have wine enough my lord anon

CLARENCE
In Gods name what art thou

FIRST MURDERER
A man as you are

CLARENCE
But not as I am royal

SECOND MURDERER
Nor you as we are loyal

CLARENCE
Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble

FIRST MURDERER
My voice is now the kings my looks mine own

CLARENCE
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
Your eyes do menace me why look you pale
Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come

SECOND MURDERER
To to to

CLARENCE
To murder me

BOTH MURDERERS
Ay ay

CLARENCE
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
Wherein my friends have I offended you

FIRST MURDERER
Offended us you have not but the king

CLARENCE
I shall be reconcild to him again

SECOND MURDERER
Never my lord therefore prepare to die

CLARENCE
Are you drawn forth among a world of men
To slay the innocent What is my offence
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge or who pronouncd
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence death
Before I be convict by course of law
To threaten me with death is most unlawful
I charge you as you hope to have redemption
By Christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins
That you depart and lay no hands on me
The deed you undertake is damnable

FIRST MURDERER
What we will do we do upon command

SECOND MURDERER
And he that hath commanded is our king

CLARENCE
Erroneous vassals the great King of kings
Hath in the table of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder will you then
Spurn at His edict and fulfil a mans
Take heed for He holds vengeance in His hand
To hurl upon their heads that break His law

SECOND MURDERER
And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee
For false forswearing and for murder too
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
In quarrel of the house of Lancaster

FIRST MURDERER
And like a traitor to the name of God
Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
Unrippdst the bowels of thy sovereigns son

SECOND MURDERER
Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend

FIRST MURDERER
How canst thou urge Gods dreadful law to us
When thou hast broke it in such dear degree

CLARENCE
Alas for whose sake did I that ill deed
For Edward for my brother for his sake
He sends you not to murder me for this
For in that sin he is as deep as I
If God will be avenged for the deed
O know you yet He doth it publicly
Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm
He needs no indirect or lawless course
To cut off those that have offended Him

FIRST MURDERER
Who made thee then a bloody minister
When gallantspringing brave Plantagenet
That princely novice was struck dead by thee

CLARENCE
My brothers love the devil and my rage

FIRST MURDERER
Thy brothers love our duty and thy faults
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee

CLARENCE
If you do love my brother hate not me
I am his brother and I love him well
If you are hird for meed go back again
And I will send you to my brother Gloster
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death

SECOND MURDERER
You are deceivd your brother Gloster hates you

CLARENCE
O no he loves me and he holds me dear
Go you to him from me

FIRST MURDERER
Ay so we will

CLARENCE
Tell him when that our princely father York
Blessd his three sons with his victorious arm
And chargd us from his soul to love each other
He little thought of this divided friendship
Bid Gloster think of this and he will weep

FIRST MURDERER
Ay millstones as he lessond us to weep

CLARENCE
O do not slander him for he is kind

FIRST MURDERER
Right as snow in harvestCome you deceive yourself
Tis he that sends us to destroy you here

CLARENCE
It cannot be for he bewept my fortune
And huggd me in his arms and swore with sobs
That he would labour my delivery

FIRST MURDERER
Why so he doth when he delivers you
From this earths thraldom to the joys of heaven

SECOND MURDERER
Make peace with God for you must die my lord

CLARENCE
Have you that holy feeling in your souls
To counsel me to make my peace with God
And are you yet to your own souls so blind
That you will war with God by murdering me
O sirs consider they that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed

SECOND MURDERER
What shall we do

CLARENCE
Relent and save your souls

FIRST MURDERER
Relent tis cowardly and womanish

CLARENCE
Not to relent is beastly savage devilish
Which of you if you were a princes son
Being pent from liberty as I am now
If two such murderers as yourselves came to you
Would not entreat for life
My friend I spy some pity in thy looks
O if thine eye be not a flatterer
Come thou on my side and entreat for me
As you would beg were you in my distress
A begging prince what beggar pities not

SECOND MURDERER
Look behind you my lord

FIRST MURDERER
Stabs him
Take that and that if all this will not do
Ill drown you in the malmseybutt within

Exit with the body

SECOND MURDERER
A bloody deed and desperately dispatchd
How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous murder

Reenter FIRST MURDERER

FIRST MURDERER
How now what meanst thou that thou helpst me not
By heavens the duke shall know how slack you have
been

SECOND MURDERER
I would he knew that I had savd his brother
Take thou the fee and tell him what I say
For I repent me that the duke is slain

Exit

FIRST MURDERER
So do not I go coward as thou art
Well Ill go hide the body in some hole
Till that the duke give order for his burial
And when I have my meed I will away
For this will out and then I must not stay

Exit

Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
There wanteth now our brother Gloster here
To make the blessed period of this peace

BUCKINGHAM
And in good time here comes the noble duke

Enter GLOSTER

GLOSTER
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen
And princely peers a happy time of day

KING EDWARD
Happy indeed as we have spent the day
Gloster we have done deeds of charity
Made peace of enmity fair love of hate
Between these swelling wrongincensed peers

GLOSTER
A blessed labour my most sovereign lord
Among this princely heap if any here
By false intelligence or wrong surmise
Hold me a foe
If I unwittingly or in my rage
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
To any in this presence I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace
Tis death to me to be at enmity
I hate it and desire all good mens love
First madam I entreat true peace of you
Which I will purchase with my duteous service
Of you my noble cousin Buckingham
If ever any grudge were lodgd between us
Of you and you Lord Rivers and of Dorset
That all without desert have frownd on me
Of you Lord Woodville and Lord Scales of you
Dukes earls lords gentlemenindeed of all
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born tonight
I thank my God for my humility

QUEEN ELIZABETH
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter
I would to God all strifes were well compounded
My sovereign lord I do beseech your highness
To take our brother Clarence to your grace

GLOSTER
Why madam have I offred love for this
To be so flouted in this royal presence
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead

They all start

You do him injury to scorn his corse

KING EDWARD
Who knows not he is dead Who knows he is

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Allseeing heaven what a world is this

BUCKINGHAM
Look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest

DORSET
Ay my good lord and no man in the presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks

KING EDWARD
Is Clarence dead the order was reversd

GLOSTER
But he poor man by your first order died
And that a winged Mercury did bear
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand
That came too lag to see him buried
God grant that some less noble and less loyal
Nearer in bloody thoughts an not in blood
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did
And yet go current from suspicion

Enter Stanley

STANLEY
A boon my sovereign for my service done

KING EDWARD
I prythee peace my soul is full of sorrow

STANLEY
I Will not rise unless your highness hear me

KING EDWARD
Then say at once what is it thou requestst

STANLEY
The forfeit sovereign of my servants life
Who slew today a riotous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk

KING EDWARD
Have I a tongue to doom my brothers death
And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave
My brother killd no manhis fault was thought
And yet his punishment was bitter death
Who sud to me for him who in my wrath
Kneeld at my feet and bid me be advisd
Who spoke of brotherhood who spoke of love
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick and did fight for me
Who told me in the field at Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down he rescud me
And said Dear brother live and be a king
Who told me when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death how he did lap me
Even in his garments and did give himself
All thin and naked to the numbcold night
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluckd and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind
But when your carters or your waitingvassals
Have done a drunken slaughter and defacd
The precious image of our dear Redeemer
You straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
And I unjustly too must grant it you
But for my brother not a man would speak
Nor I ungracious speak unto myself
For him poor soul The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life
Yet none of you would once beg for his life
O God I fear Thy justice will take hold
On me and you and mine and yours for this
Come Hastings help me to my closet
Ah poor Clarence

Exeunt KING QUEEN HASTINGS RIVERS DORSET and GREY

GLOSTER
This is the fruit of rashness Markd you not
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
Lookd pale when they did hear of Clarence death
O they did urge it still unto the king
God will revenge itCome lords will you go
To comfort Edward with our company

BUCKINGHAM
We wait upon your grace

Exeunt



SCENE II Another Room in the palace

Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK with A SON and DAUGHTER of
CLARENCE

SON
Good grandam tell us is our father dead

DUCHESS
No boy

DAUGHTER
Why do you weep so oft and beat your breast
And cry O Clarence my unhappy son

SON
Why do you look on us and shake your head
And call us orphans wretches castaways
If that our noble father were alive

DUCHESS
My pretty cousins you mistake me both
I do lament the sickness of the king
As loath to lose him not your fathers death
It were lost sorrow to wail one thats lost

SON
Then you conclude my grandam he is dead
The king mine uncle is to blame for this
God will revenge it whom I will importune
With earnest prayers all to that effect

DAUGHTER
And so will I

DUCHESS
Peace children peace the king doth love you well
Incapable and shallow innocents
You cannot guess who causd your fathers death

SON
Grandam we can for my good uncle Gloster
Told me the king provokd to it by the queen
Devisd impeachments to imprison him
And when my uncle told me so he wept
And pitied me and kindly kissd my cheek
Bade me rely on him as on my father
And he would love me dearly as his child

DUCHESS
Ah that deceit should steal such gentle shape
And with a virtuous visard hide deep vice
He is my son ay and therein my shame
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit

SON
Think you my uncle did dissemble grandam

DUCHESS
Ay boy

SON
I cannot think itHark what noise is this

Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH distractedly RIVERS and DORSET following
her

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ah who shall hinder me to wail and weep
To chide my fortune and torment myself
Ill join with black despair against my soul
And to myself become an enemy

DUCHESS
What means this scene of rude impatience

QUEEN ELIZABETH
To make an act of tragic violence
Edward my lord thy son our king is dead
Why grow the branches when the root is gone
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap
If you will live lament if die be brief
That our swiftwinged souls may catch the kings
Or like obedient subjects follow him
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest

DUCHESS
Ah so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband
I have bewept a worthy husbands death
And livd by looking on his images
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
Are crackd in pieces by malignant death
And I for comfort have but one false glass
That grieves me when I see my shame in him
Thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
And hast the comfort of thy children left
But death hath snatchd my husband from mine arms
And pluckd two crutches from my feeble hands
Clarence and Edward O what cause have I
Thine being but a moiety of my moan
To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries

SON
Ah aunt you wept not for our fathers death
How can we aid you with our kindred tears

DAUGHTER
Our fatherless distress was left unmoand
Your widowdolour likewise be unwept

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Give me no help in lamentation
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
That I being governd by the watery moon
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
Ah for my husband for my dear Lord Edward

CHILDREN
Ah for our father for our dear Lord Clarence

DUCHESS
Alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence

QUEEN ELIZABETH
What stay had I but Edward and hes gone

CHILDREN
What stay had we but Clarence and hes gone

DUCHESS
What stays had I but they and they are gone

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Was never widow had so dear a loss

CHILDREN
Were never orphans had so dear a loss

DUCHESS
Was never mother had so dear a loss
Alas I am the mother of these griefs
Their woes are parcelld mine is general
She for an Edward weeps and so do I
I for a Clarence weep so doth not she
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I
I for an Edward weep so do not they
Alas you three on me threefold distressd
Pour all your tears I am your sorrows nurse
And I will pamper it with lamentation

DORSET
Comfort dear mother God is much displeasd
That you take with unthankfulness His doing
In common worldly things tis called ungrateful
With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven
For it requires the royal debt it lent you

RIVERS
Madam bethink you like a careful mother
Of the young prince your son send straight for him
Let him be crownd in him your comfort lives
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edwards grave
And plant your joys in living Edwards throne

Enter GLOSTER BUCKINGHAM STANLEY HASTINGS RATCLIFF and
others

GLOSTER
Sister have comfort all of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star
But none can help our harms by wailing them
Madam my mother I do cry you mercy
I did not see your gracehumbly on my knee
I crave your blessing

DUCHESS
God bless thee and put meekness in thy breast
Love charity obedience and true duty

GLOSTER
Amen Aside
And make me die a good old man
That is the butt end of a mothers blessing
I marvel that her grace did leave it out

BUCKINGHAM
You cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers
That bear this heavy mutual load of moan
Now cheer each other in each others love
Though we have spent our harvest of this king
We are to reap the harvest of his son
The broken rancour of your highswoln hearts
But lately splinterd knit and joind together
Must gently be preservd cherishd and kept
Me seemeth good that with some little train
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetched
Hither to London to be crownd our king

RIVERS
Why with some little train my Lord of Buckingham

BUCKINGHAM
Marry my lord lest by a multitude
The newheald wound of malice should break out
Which would be so much the more dangerous
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd
Where every horse bears his commanding rein
And may direct his course as please himself
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent
In my opinion ought to be prevented

GLOSTER
I hope the king made peace with all of us
And the compact is firm and true in me

RIVERS
And so in me and so I think in all
Yet since it is but green it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach
Which haply by much company might be urgd
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince

HASTINGS
And so say I

GLOSTER
Then be it so and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow
Madamand you my motherwill you go
To give your censures in this business

Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOSTER

BUCKINGHAM
My lord whoever journeys to the prince
For Godd sake let not us two stay at home
For by the way Ill sort occasion
As index to the story we late talkd of
To part the queens proud kindred from the Prince

GLOSTER
My other self my counsels consistory
My oracle my prophetmy dear cousin
I as a child will go by thy direction
Toward Ludlow then for well not stay behind

Exeunt



SCENE III London A street

Enter two CITIZENS meeting

FIRST CITIZEN
Good morrow neighbour whither away so fast

SECOND CITIZEN
I promise you I scarcely know myself
Hear you the news abroad

FIRST CITIZEN
Yesthat the king is dead

SECOND CITIZEN
Ill news byr lady seldom comes the better
I fear I fear twill prove a giddy world

Enter third CITIZEN

THIRD CITIZEN
Neighbours God speed

FIRST CITIZEN
Give you good morrow sir

THIRD CITIZEN
Doth the news hold of good King Edwards death

SECOND CITIZEN
Ay sir it is too true God help the while

THIRD CITIZEN
Then masters look to see a troublous world

FIRST CITIZEN
No no by Gods good grace his son shall reign

THIRD CITIZEN
Woe to that land thats governd by a child

SECOND CITIZEN
In him there is a hope of government
Which in his nonage council under him
And in his full and ripend years himself
No doubt shall then and till then govern well

FIRST CITIZEN
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crownd in Paris but at nine months old

THIRD CITIZEN
Stood the state so No no good friends God wot
For then this land was famously enrichd
With politic grave counsel then the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace

FIRST CITIZEN
Why so hath this both by his father and mother

THIRD CITIZEN
Better it were they all came by his father
Or by his father there were none at all
For emulation who shall now be nearest
Will touch us all too near if God prevent not
O full of danger is the Duke of Gloster
And the queens sons and brothers haught and proud
And were they to be ruld and not to rule
This sickly land might solace as before

FIRST CITIZEN
Come come we fear the worst all will be well

THIRD CITIZEN
When clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks
When great leaves fall then winter is at hand
When the sun sets who doth not look for night
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth
All may be well but if God sort it so
Tis more than we deserve or I expect

SECOND CITIZEN
Truly the hearts of men are fun of fear
You cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and fun of dread

THIRD CITIZEN
Before the days of change still is it so
By a divine instinct mens minds mistrust
Ensuing danger as by proof we see
The water swell before a boisterous storm
But leave it all to GodWhither away

SECOND CITIZEN
Marry we were sent for to the justices

THIRD CITIZEN
And so was I Ill bear you company

Exeunt



SCENE IV London A Room in the Palace

Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK the young DUKE OF YORK QUEEN
ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK

ARCHBISHOP
Last night I hear they at Northampton lay
And at StonyStratford they do rest tonight
Tomorrow or next day they will be here

DUCHESS
I long with all my heart to see the prince
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him

QUEEN ELIZABETH
But I hear no they say my son of York
Has almost overtaen him in his growth

YORK
Ay mother but I would not have it so

DUCHESS
Why my good cousin it is good to grow

YORK
Grandam one night as we did sit at supper
My uncle Rivers talkd how I did grow
More than my brother Ay quoth my uncle Gloster
Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace
And since methinks I would not grow so fast
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste

DUCHESS
Good faith good faith the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee
He was the wretchedst thing when he was young
So long a growing and so leisurely
That if his rule were true he should be gracious

ARCHBISHOP
And so no doubt he is my gracious madam

DUCHESS
I hope he is but yet let mothers doubt

YORK
Now by my troth if I had been rememberd
I could have given my uncles grace a flout
To touch his growth nearer than he touchd mine

DUCHESS
How my young York I prythee let me hear it

YORK
Marry they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth
Grandam this would have been a biting jest

DUCHESS
I prythee pretty York who told thee this

YORK
Grandam his nurse

DUCHESS
His nurse why she was dead ere thou wast born

YORK
If twere not she I cannot tell who told me

QUEEN ELIZABETH
A parlous boygo to you are too shrewd

ARCHBISHOP
Good madam be not angry with the child

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Pitchers have ears

ARCHBISHOP
Here comes a messenger

Enter a MESSENGER

What news

MESSENGER
Such news my lord as grieves me to report

QUEEN ELIZABETH
How doth the prince

MESSENGER
Well madam and in health

DUCHESS
What is thy news

MESSENGER
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan prisoners

DUCHESS
Who hath committed them

MESSENGER
The mighty dukes Gloster and Buckingham

ARCHBISHOP
For what offence

MESSENGER
The sum of all I can I have disclosd
Why or for what the nobles were committed
Is all unknown to me my gracious lady

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ah me I see the ruin of my house
The tiger now hath seizd the gentle hind
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne
Welcome destruction blood and massacre
I see as in a map the end of all

DUCHESS
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days
How many of you have mine eyes beheld
My husband lost his life to get the crown
And often up and down my sons were tossd
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss
And being seated and domestic broils
Clean overblown themselves the conquerors
Make war upon themselves brother to brother
Blood to blood self against self O preposterous
And frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
Or let me die to look on death no more

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Come come my boy we will to sanctuary
Madam farewell

DUCHESS
Stay I will go with you

QUEEN ELIZABETH
You have no cause

ARCHBISHOP
To the queen
My gracious lady go
And thither bear your treasure and your goods
For my part Ill resign unto your grace
The seal I keep and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours
Go Ill conduct you to the sanctuary

Exeunt



ACT III

SCENE I London A street

The trumpets sound Enter the PRINCE OF WALES GLOSTER
BUCKINGHAM CATESBY CARDINAL BOURCHIER and others

BUCKINGHAM
Welcome sweet prince to London to your chamber

GLOSTER
Welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign
The weary way hath made you melancholy

PRINCE
No uncle but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome me

GLOSTER
Sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet divd into the worlds deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show which God He knows
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
Those uncles which you want were dangerous
Your grace attended to their sugard words
But lookd not on the poison of their hearts
God keep you from them and from such false friends

PRINCE
God keep me from false friends but they were none

GLOSTER
My lord the mayor of London comes to greet you

Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train

MAYOR
God bless your grace with health and happy days

PRINCE
I thank you good my lordand thank you all

Exeunt MAYOR c

I thought my mother and my brother York
Would long ere this have met us on the way
Fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not
To tell us whether they will come or no

BUCKINGHAM
And in good time here comes the sweating lord

Enter HASTINGS

PRINCE
Welcome my lord what will our mother come

HASTINGS
On what occasion God He knows not I
The queen your mother and your brother York
Have taken sanctuary the tender prince
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace
But by his mother was perforce withheld

BUCKINGHAM
Fie what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hersLord cardinal will your grace
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently
If she deny Lord Hastings go with him
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce

CARDINAL
My Lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory
Can from his mother win the Duke of York
Anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
To mild entreaties God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the holy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin

BUCKINGHAM
You are too senselessobstinate my lord
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age
You break not sanctuary in seizing him
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deservd the place
And those who have the wit to claim the place
This prince hath neither claimd it nor deservd it
And therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
Then taking him from thence that is not there
You break no privilege nor charter there
Oft have I heard of sanctuarymen
But sanctuarychildren neer till now

CARDINAL
My lord you shall oerrule my mind for once
Come on Lord Hastings will you go with me

HASTINGS
I go my lord

PRINCE
Good lords make all the speedy haste you may

Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS

Say uncle Gloster if our brother come
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation

GLOSTER
Where it seems best unto your royal self
If I may counsel you some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower
Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and recreation

PRINCE
I do not like the Tower of any place
Did Julius Caesar build that place my lord

BUCKINGHAM
He did my gracious lord begin that place
Which since succeeding ages have reedified

PRINCE
Is it upon record or else reported
Successively from age to age he built it

BUCKINGHAM
Upon record my gracious lord

PRINCE
But say my lord it were not registerd
Methinks the truth should live from age to age
As twere retaild to all posterity
Even to the general allending day

GLOSTER
Aside
So wise so young they say do never live long

PRINCE
What say you uncle

GLOSTER
I say without characters fame lives long

Aside
Thus like the formal vice Iniquity
I moralize two meanings in one word

PRINCE
That Julius Caesar was a famous man
With what his valour did enrich his wit
His wit set down to make his valour live
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror
For now he lives in fame though not in life
Ill tell you what my cousin Buckingham

BUCKINGHAM
What my gracious lord

PRINCE
An if I live until I be a man
Ill win our ancient right in France again
Or die a soldier as I livd a king

GLOSTER
Aside
Short summers lightly have a forward spring

BUCKINGHAM
Now in good time here comes the Duke of York

Enter YORK HASTINGS and the CARDINAL

PRINCE
Richard of York how fares our loving brother

YORK
Well my dread lord so must I call you now

PRINCE
Ay brotherto our grief as it is yours
Too late he died that might have kept that title
Which by his death hath lost much majesty

GLOSTER
How fares our cousin noble Lord of York

YORK
I thank you gentle uncle O my lord
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far

GLOSTER
He hath my lord

YORK
And therefore is he idle

GLOSTER
O my fair cousin I must not say so

YORK
Then he is more beholding to you than I

GLOSTER
He may command me as my sovereign
But you have power in me as in a kinsman

YORK
I pray you uncle give me this dagger

GLOSTER
My dagger little cousin with all my heart

PRINCE
A beggar brother

YORK
Of my kind uncle that I know will give
And being but a toy which is no grief to give

GLOSTER
A greater gift than that Ill give my cousin

YORK
A greater gift O thats the sword to it

GLOSTER
Ay gentle cousin were it light enough

YORK
O then I see you will part but with light gifts
In weightier things youll say a beggar nay

GLOSTER
It is too heavy for your grace to wear

YORK
I weigh it lightly were it heavier

GLOSTER
What would you have my weapon little lord

YORK
I would that I might thank you as you call me

GLOSTER
How

YORK
Little

PRINCE
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk
Uncle your grace knows how to bear with him

YORK
You mean to bear me not to bear with me
Uncle my brother mocks both you and me
Because that I am little like an ape
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders

BUCKINGHAM
With what a sharpprovided wit he reasons
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
He prettily and aptly taunts himself
So cunning and so young is wonderful

GLOSTER
My lord wilt please you pass along
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you

YORK
What will you go unto the Tower my lord

PRINCE
My lord protector needs will have it so

YORK
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower

GLOSTER
Why what should you fear

YORK
Marry my uncle Clarence angry ghost
My grandam told me he was murderd there

PRINCE
I fear no uncles dead

GLOSTER
Nor none that live I hope

PRINCE
An if they live I hope I need not fear
But come my lord and with a heavy heart
Thinking on them go I unto the Tower

Sennet Exeunt PRINCE YORK HASTINGS CARDINAL and
Attendants

BUCKINGHAM
Think you my lord this little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously

GLOSTER
No doubt no doubt O tis a parlous boy
Bold quick ingenious forward capable
He is all the mothers from the top to toe

BUCKINGHAM
Well let them restCome hither Catesby
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart
Thou knowst our reasons urgd upon the way
What thinkst thou is it not an easy matter
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind
For the instalment of this noble duke
In the seat royal of this famous isle

CATESBY
He for his fathers sake so loves the prince
That he will not be won to aught against him

BUCKINGHAM
What thinkst thou then of Stanley will not he

CATESBY
He will do all in all as Hastings doth

BUCKINGHAM
Well then no more but this go gentle Catesby
And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings
How he doth stand affected to our purpose
And summon him tomorrow to the Tower
To sit about the coronation
If thou dost find him tractable to us
Encourage him and tell him all our reasons
If he be leaden icy cold unwilling
Be thou so too and so break off the talk
And give us notice of his inclination
For we tomorrow hold divided councils
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employd

GLOSTER
Commend me to Lord William tell him Catesby
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle
And bid my lord for joy of this good news
Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more

BUCKINGHAM
Good Catesby go effect this business soundly

CATESBY
My good lords both with all the heed I can

GLOSTER
Shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep

CATESBY
You shall my lord

GLOSTER
At Crosby Place there shall you find us both

Exit CATESBY

BUCKINGHAM
Now my lord what shall we do if we perceive
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots

GLOSTER
Chop off his head mansomewhat we will do
And look when I am king claim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford and all the movables
Whereof the king my brother was possessd

BUCKINGHAM
Ill claim that promise at your graces hand

GLOSTER
And look to have it yielded with all kindness
Come let us sup betimes that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form

Exeunt



SCENE II Before LORD HASTINGS house

Enter a MESSENGER

MESSENGER
My lord my lord
Knocking

HASTINGS
Within Who knocks

MESSENGER
One from the Lord Stanley

HASTINGS
Within What ist oclock

MESSENGER
Upon the stroke of four

Enter HASTINGS

HASTINGS
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights

MESSENGER
So it appears by that I have to say
First he commends him to your noble self

HASTINGS
What then

MESSENGER
Then certifies your lordship that this night
He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm
Besides he says there are two councils held
And that may be determind at the one
Which may make you and him to rue at the other
Therefore he sends to know your lordships pleasure
If you will presently take horse with him
And with all speed post with him toward the north
To shun the danger that his soul divines

HASTINGS
Go fellow go return unto thy lord
Bid him not fear the separated councils
His honour and myself are at the one
And at the other is my good friend Catesby
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence
Tell him his fears are shallow without instance
And for his dreams I wonder hes so simple
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To fly the boar before the boar pursues
Were to incense the boar to follow us
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase
Go bid thy master rise and come to me
And we will both together to the Tower
Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly

MESSENGER
Ill go my lord and tell him what you say

Exit

Enter CATESBY

CATESBY
Many good morrows to my noble lord

HASTINGS
Good morrow Catesby you are early stirring
What news what news in this our tottering state

CATESBY
It is a reeling world indeed my lord
And I believe will never stand upright
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm

HASTINGS
How wear the garland dost thou mean the crown

CATESBY
Ay my good lord

HASTINGS
Ill have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Before Ill see the crown so foul misplacd
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it

CATESBY
Ay on my life and hopes to find you forward
Upon his party for the gain thereof
And thereupon he sends you this good news
That this same very day your enemies
The kindred of the queen must die at Pomfret

HASTINGS
Indeed I am no mourner for that news
Because they have been still my adversaries
But that Ill give my voice on Richards side
To bar my masters heirs in true descent
God knows I will not do it to the death

CATESBY
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind

HASTINGS
But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence
That they which brought me in my masters hate
I live to look upon their tragedy
Well Catesby ere a fortnight make me older
Ill send some packing that yet think not ont

CATESBY
Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
When men are unprepard and look not for it

HASTINGS
O monstrous monstrous and so falls it out
With Rivers Vaughan Grey and so twill do
With some men else that think themselves as safe
As thou and I who as thou knowest are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckingham

CATESBY
The princes both make high account of you

Aside
For they account his head upon the bridge

HASTINGS
I know they do and I have well deservd it

Enter STANLEY

Come on come on where is your boarspear man
Fear you the boar and go so unprovided

STANLEY
My lord good morrow and good morrow Catesby
You may jest on but by the holy rood
I do not like these several councils I

HASTINGS
My lord I hold my life as dear as you do yours
And never in my days I do protest
Was it so precious to me as tis now
Think you but that I know our state secure
I would be so triumphant as I am

STANLEY
The lords at Pomfret when they rode from London
Were jocund and supposd their states were sure
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust
But yet you see how soon the day oercast
This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt

Today shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth for duty and for loyalty

GREY
God bless the prince from all the pack of you
A knot you are of damned bloodsuckers

VAUGHAN
You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter

RATCLIFF
Despatch the limit of your lives is out

RIVERS
O Pomfret Pomfret O thou bloody prison
Fatal and ominous to noble peers
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the Second here was hackd to death
And for more slander to thy dismal seat
We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink

GREY
Now Margarets curse is fallen upon our heads
When she exclaimd on Hastings you and I
For standing by when Richard stabbd her son

RIVERS
Then cursd she Richard then cursd she Buckingham
Then cursd she HastingsO remember God
To hear her prayer for them as now for us
And for my sister and her princely sons
Be satisfied dear God with our true blood
Which as Thou knowst unjustly must be spilt

RATCLIFF
Make haste the hour of death is expiate

RIVERS
Come Greycome Vaughanlet us here embrace
Farewell until we meet again in heaven

Exeunt



SCENE IV London A Room in the Tower

LOVEL

HASTINGS
Now noble peers the cause why we are met
Is to determine of the coronation
In Gods name speakwhen is the royal day

BUCKINGHAM
Are all things ready for that royal time

STANLEY
Thery are and wants but nomination

ELY
Tomorrow then I judge a happy day

BUCKINGHAM
Who knows the lord protectors mind herein
Who is most inward with the noble duke

ELY
Your grace we think should soonest know his mind

BUCKINGHAM
We know each others faces for our hearts
He knows no more of mine than I of yours
Or I of his my lord than you of mine
Lord Hastings you and he are near in love

HASTINGS
I thank his grace I know he loves me well
But for his purpose in the coronation
I have not sounded him nor he deliverd
His gracious pleasure any way therein
But you my honourable lords may name the time
And in the dukes behalf Ill give my voice
Which I presume hell take in gentle part

ELY
In happy time here comes the duke himself

Enter GLOSTER

GLOSTER
My noble lords and cousins all good morrow
I have been long a sleeper but I trust
My absence doth neglect no great design
Which by my presence might have been concluded

BUCKINGHAM
Had you not come upon your cue my lord
William Lord Hastings had pronouncd your part
I mean your voicefor crowning of the king

GLOSTER
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder
His lordship knows me well and loves me well
My lord of Ely when I was last in Holborn
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them

ELY
Marry and will my lord with all my heart

Exit

GLOSTER
Cousin of Buckingham a word with you

Takes him aside

Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business
And finds the testy gentleman so hot
That he will lose his head ere give consent
His masters child as worshipfully he terms it
Shall lose the royalty of Englands throne

BUCKINGHAM
Withdraw yourself awhile Ill go with you

Exeunt GLOSTER and BUCKINGHAM

STANLEY
We have not yet set down this day of triumph
Tomorrow in my judgment is too sudden
For I myself am not so well provided
As else I would be were the day prolongd

Reenter BISHOP OF ELY

ELY
Where is my lord the Duke of Gloster
I have sent for these strawberries

HASTINGS
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning
Theres some conceit or other likes him well
When that he bids good morrow with such spirit
I think theres neer a man in Christendom
Can lesser hide his love or hate than he
For by his face straight shall you know his heart

STANLEY
What of his heart perceive you in his face
By any livelihood he showed today

HASTINGS
Marry that with no man here he is offended
For were he he had shown it in his looks

Reenter GLOSTER and BUCKINGHAM

GLOSTER
I pray you all tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft and that have prevaild
Upon my body with their hellish charms

HASTINGS
The tender love I bear your grace my lord
Makes me most forward in this princely presence
To doom the offenders whosoeer they be
I say my lord they have deserved death

GLOSTER
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil
Look how I am bewitchd behold mine arm
Is like a blasted sapling witherd up
And this is Edwards wife that monstrous witch
Consorted with that harlotstrumpet Shore
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me

HASTINGS
If they have done this deed my noble lord

GLOSTER
Ifthou protector of this damned strumpet
Talkst thou to me of ifsThou art a traitor
Off with his headnow by Saint Paul I swear
I will not dine until I see the same
Lovel and Ratclifflook that it be done
The rest that love me rise and follow me

Exeunt all except HASTINGS LOVEL and RATCLIFF

HASTINGS
Woe woe for England not a whit for me
For I too fond might have prevented this
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm
And I did scorn it and disdain to fly
Three times today my footcloth horse did stumble
And started when he lookd upon the Tower
As loth to bear me to the slaughterhouse
O now I need the priest that spake to me
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As too triumphing how mine enemies
Today at Pomfret bloodily were butcherd
And I myself secure in grace and favour
O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings wretched head

RATCLIFF
Come come despatch the duke would be at dinner
Make a short shrift he longs to see your head

HASTINGS
O momentary grace of mortal men
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God
Who builds his hope in air of your good looks
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
Ready with every nod to tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep

LOVEL
Come come despatch tis bootless to exclaim

HASTINGS
O bloody Richardmiserable England
I prophesy the fearfullst time to thee
That ever wretched age hath lookd upon
Come lead me to the block bear him my head
They smile at me who shortly shall be dead

Exeunt



SCENE V London The Tower Walls

Enter GLOSTER and BUCKINGHAM in rusty armour marvellous
illfavoured

GLOSTER
Come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour
Murder thy breath in middle of a word
And then again begin and stop again
As if thou were distraught and mad with terror

BUCKINGHAM
Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian
Speak and look back and pry on every side
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw
Intending deep suspicion ghastly looks
Are at my service like enforced smiles
And both are ready in their offices
At any time to grace my stratagems
But what is Catesby gone

GLOSTER
He is and see he brings the mayor along

Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY

BUCKINGHAM
Lord mayor

GLOSTER
Look to the drawbridge there

BUCKINGHAM
Hark a drum

GLOSTER
Catesby oerlook the walls

BUCKINGHAM
Lord Mayor the reason we have sent

GLOSTER
Look back defend theehere are enemies

BUCKINGHAM
God and our innocency defend and guard us

GLOSTER
Be patient they are friendsRatcliff and Lovel

Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF with HASTINGS head

LOVEL
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings

GLOSTER
So dear I lovd the man that I must weep
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathd upon the earth a Christian
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts
So smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue
That his apparent open guilt omitted
I mean his conversation with Shores wife
He livd from all attainder of suspects

BUCKINGHAM
Well well he was the covertst shelterd traitor
That ever livd
Would you imagine or almost believe
Weret not that by great preservation
We live to tell it youthat the subtle traitor
This day had plotted in the councilhouse
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloster

MAYOR
Had he done so

GLOSTER
What think you we are Turks or Infidels
Or that we would against the form of law
Proceed thus rashly in the villains death
But that the extreme peril of the case
The peace of England and our persons safety
Enforcd us to this execution

MAYOR
Now fair befall you he deservd his death
And your good graces both have well proceeded
To warn false traitors from the like attempts
I never lookd for better at his hands
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore

BUCKINGHAM
Yet had we not determind he should die
Until your lordship came to see his end
Which now the loving haste of these our friends
Something against our meanings have prevented
Because my lord we would have had you heard
The traitor speak and timorously confess
The manner and the purpose of his treasons
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens who haply may
Misconster us in him and wail his death

MAYOR
But my good lord your graces word shall serve
As well as I had seen and heard him speak
And do not doubt right noble princes both
But Ill acquaint our duteous citizens
With all your just proceedings in this case

GLOSTER
And to that end we wishd your lordship here
To avoid the the the censures of the carping world

BUCKINGHAM
But since you come too late of our intent
Yet witness what you hear we did intend
And so my good lord mayor we bid farewell

Exit LORD MAYOR

GLOSTER
Go after after cousin Buckingham
The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post
There at your meetst advantage of the time
Infer the bastardy of Edwards children
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
Only for saying he would make his son
Heir to the crownmeaning indeed his house
Which by the sign thereof was termed so
Moreover urge his hateful luxury
And bestial appetite in change of lust
Which stretchd unto their servants daughters wives
Even where his raging eye or savage heart
Without control listed to make a prey
Nay for a need thus far come near my person
Tell them when that my mother went with child
Of that insatiate Edward noble York
My princely father then had wars in France
And by true computation of the time
Found that the issue was not his begot
Which well appeared in his lineaments
Being nothing like the noble duke my father
Yet touch this sparingly as twere far off
Because my lord you know my mother lives

BUCKINGHAM
Doubt not my lord Ill play the orator
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself and so my lord adieu

GLOSTER
If you thrive well bring them to Baynards Castle
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well learned bishops

BUCKINGHAM
I go and towards three or four oclock
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords

Exit

GLOSTER
Go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw
Go thou to CATESBY to Friar Penkerbid them both
Meet me within this hour at Baynards Castle

Exeunt LOVEL and CATESBY

Now will I in to take some privy order
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight
And to give order that no manner person
Have any time recourse unto the princes

Exit



SCENE VI London A street

Enter a SCRIVENER

SCRIVENER
Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings
Which in a set hand fairly is engrossd
That it may be today read oer in Pauls
And mark how well the sequel hangs together
Eleven hours I have spent to write it over
For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me
The precedent was full as long adoing
And yet within these five hours Hastings livd
Untainted unexamind free at liberty
Heres a good world the while Who is so gross
That cannot see this palpable device
Yet who so bold but says he sees it not
Bad is the world and all will come to naught
When such ill dealing must be seen in thought

Exit



SCENE VII London Court of Baynards Castle

Enter GLOSTER and BUCKINGHAM meeting

GLOSTER
How now how now what say the citizens

BUCKINGHAM
Now by the holy mother of our Lord
The citizens are mum say not a word

GLOSTER
Touchd you the bastardy of Edwards children

BUCKINGHAM
I did with his contract with Lady Lucy
And his contract by deputy in France
The insatiate greediness of his desires
And his enforcement of the city wives
His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
As being got your father then in France
And his resemblance being not like the duke
Withal I did infer your lineaments
Being the right idea of your father
Both in your form and nobleness of mind
Laid open all your victories in Scotland
Your discipline in war wisdom in peace
Your bounty virtue fair humility
Indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose
Untouchd or slightly handled in discourse
And when mine oratory drew toward end
I bid them that did love their countrys good
Cry God save Richard Englands royal king

GLOSTER
And did they so

BUCKINGHAM
No so God help me they spake not a word
But like dumb statues or breathing stones
Stard each on other and lookd deadly pale
Which when I saw I reprehended them
And askd the mayor what meant this wilful silence
His answer wasthe people were not usd
To be spoke to but by the recorder
Then he was urgd to tell my tale again
Thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd
But nothing spoke in warrant from himself
When he had done some followers of mine own
At lower end of the hall hurld up their caps
And some ten voices cried God save King Richard
And thus I took the vantage of those few
Thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth I
This general applause and cheerful shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard
And even here brake off and came away

GLOSTER
What tongueless blocks were they would they not speak
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come

BUCKINGHAM
The mayor is here at hand Intend some fear
Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
And look you get a prayerbook in your hand
And stand between two churchmen good my lord
For on that ground Ill make a holy descant
And be not easily won to our requests
Play the maids partstill answer nay and take it

GLOSTER
I go and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself
No doubt we bring it to a happy issue

BUCKINGHAM
Go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks

Exit GLOSTER

Enter the LORD MAYOR ALDERMEN and Citizens

Welcome my lord I dance attendance here
I think the duke will not be spoke withal

Enter from the Castle CATESBY

Now Catesbywhat says your lord to my request

CATESBY
He doth entreat your grace my noble lord
To visit him tomorrow or next day
He is within with two right reverend fathers
Divinely bent to meditation
And in no worldly suit would he be movd
To draw him from his holy exercise

BUCKINGHAM
Return good Catesby to the gracious duke
Tell him myself the mayor and aldermen
In deep designs in matter of great moment
No less importing than our general good
Are come to have some conference with his grace

CATESBY
Ill signify so much unto him straight

Exit

BUCKINGHAM
Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward
He is not lolling on a lewd daybed
But on his knees at meditation
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans
But meditating with two deep divines
Not sleeping to engross his idle body
But praying to enrich his watchful soul
Happy were England would this virtuous prince
Take on his grace the sovereignty thereof
But sure I fear we shall not win him to it

MAYOR
Marry God defend his grace should say us nay

BUCKINGHAM
I fear he will Here Catesby comes again

Reenter CATESBY

Now Catesby what says his grace

CATESBY
He wonders to what end you have assembled
Such troops of citizens to come to him
His grace not being warnd thereof before
He fears my lord you mean no good to him

BUCKINGHAM
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me that I mean no good to him
By heaven we come to him in perfect love
And so once more return and tell his grace

Exit CATESBY

When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads tis much to draw them thence
So sweet is zealous contemplation

Enter GLOSTER in a Galery above between two BISHOPS CATESBY
returns

MAYOR
See where his grace stands tween two clergymen

BUCKINGHAM
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince
To stay him from the fall of vanity
And see a book of prayer in his hand
True ornaments to know a holy man
Famous Plantagenet most gracious prince
Lend favourable ear to our requests
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal

GLOSTER
My lord there needs no such apology
I rather do beseech you pardon me
Who earnest in the service of my God
Deferrd the visitation of my friends
But leaving this what is your graces pleasure

BUCKINGHAM
Even that I hope which pleaseth God above
And all good men of this ungovernd isle

GLOSTER
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the citys eye
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance

BUCKINGHAM
You have my lord would it might please your grace
On our entreaties to amend your fault

GLOSTER
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land

BUCKINGHAM
Know then it is your fault that you resign
The supreme seat the throne majestical
The scepterd office of your ancestors
Your state of fortune and your due of birth
The lineal glory of your royal house
To the corruption of a blemishd stock
Whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
Which here we waken to our countrys good
The noble isle doth want her proper limbs
Her face defacd with scars of infamy
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
And almost shoulderd in the swallowing gulf
Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion
Which to recure we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land
Not as protector steward substitute
Or lowly factor for anothers gain
But as successively from blood to blood
Your right of birth your empery your own
For this consorted with the citizens
Your very worshipful and loving friends
And by their vehement instigation
In this just cause come I to move your grace

GLOSTER
I cannot tell if to depart in silence
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
If not to answer you might haply think
Tonguetied ambition not replying yielded
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
Which fondly you would here impose on me
If to reprove you for this suit of yours
So seasond with your faithful love to me
Then on the other side I checkd my friends
Thereforeto speak and to avoid the first
And then in speaking not to incur the last
Definitively thus I answer you
Your love deserves my thanks but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request
First if all obstacles were cut away
And that my path were even to the crown
As the ripe revenue and due of birth
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit
So mighty and so many my defects
That I would rather hide me from my greatness
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea
Than in my greatness covet to be hid
And in the vapour of my glory smotherd
But God be thankd there is no need of me
And much I need to help you were there need
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
Which mellowd by the stealing hours of time
Will well become the seat of majesty
And make no doubt us happy by his reign
On him I lay that you would lay on me
The right and fortune of his happy stars
Which God defend that I should wring from him

BUCKINGHAM
My lord this argues conscience in your grace
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial
All circumstances well considered
You say that Edward is your brothers son
So say we too but not by Edwards wife
For first was he contract to Lady Lucy
Your mother lives a witness to his vow
And afterward by substitute betrothd
To Bona sister to the King of France
These both put off a poor petitioner
A carecrazd mother to a many sons
A beautywaning and distressed widow
Even in the afternoon of her best days
Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye
Seducd the pitch and height of his degree
To base declension and loathd bigamy
By her in his unlawful bed he got
This Edward whom our manners call the prince
More bitterly could I expostulate
Save that for reverence to some alive
I give a sparing limit to my tongue
Then good my lord take to your royal self
This profferd benefit of dignity
If not to bless us and the land withal
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing time
Unto a lineal truederived course

MAYOR
Do good my lord your citizens entreat you

BUCKINGHAM
Refuse not mighty lord this profferd love

CATESBY
O make them joyful grant their lawful suit

GLOSTER
Alas why would you heap those cares on me
I am unfit for state and majesty
I do beseech you take it not amiss
I cannot nor I will not yield to you

BUCKINGHAM
If you refuse itas in love and zeal
Loath to depose the child your brothers son
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle kind effeminate remorse
Which we have noted in you to your kindred
And equally indeed to all estates
Yet know wheer you accept our suit or no
Your brothers son shall never reign our king
But we will plant some other in the throne
To the disgrace and downfall of your house
And in this resolution here we leave you
Come citizens we will entreat no more

Exeunt BUCKINGHAM the MAYOR and citizens retiring

CATESBY
Call them again sweet prince accept their suit
If you deny them all the land will rue it

GLOSTER
Will you enforce me to a world of cares
Call them again

CATESBY goes to the MAYOR c and then exit

I am not made of stone
But penetrable to your kind entreaties
Albeit against my conscience and my soul

Reenter BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY MAYOR c coming forward

Cousin of Buckinghamand sage grave men
Since you will buckle fortune on my back
To bear her burden wheer I will or no
I must have patience to endure the load
But if black scandal or foulfacd reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof
For God doth know and you may partly see
How far I am from the desire of this

MAYOR
God bless your grace we see it and will say it

GLOSTER
In saying so you shall but say the truth

BUCKINGHAM
Then I salute you with this royal title
Long live King Richard Englands worthy king

ALL
Amen

BUCKINGHAM
Tomorrow may it please you to be crownd

GLOSTER
Even when you please for you will have it so

BUCKINGHAM
Tomorrow then we will attend your grace
And so most joyfully we take our leave

GLOSTER
To the BISHOPS
Come let us to our holy work again
Farewell my cousinfarewell gentle friends

Exeunt

And Ill salute your grace of York as mother
And reverend lookeron of two fair queens
To the DUCHESS OF GLOSTER
Come madam you must straight to Westminster

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ah cut my lace asunder
That my pent heart may have some scope to beat
Or else I swoon with this deadkilling news

ANNE
Despiteful tidings O unpleasing news

DORSET
Be of good cheer mother how fares your grace

QUEEN ELIZABETH
O Dorset speak not to me get thee gone
Death and destruction dog thee at thy heels
Thy mothers name is ominous to children
If thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas
And live with Richmond from the reach of hell
Go hie thee hie thee from this slaughterhouse
Lest thou increase the number of the dead
And make me die the thrall of Margarets curse
Nor mother wife nor Englands counted queen

STANLEY
Full of wise care is this your counsel madam
Take all the swift advantage of the hours
You shall have letters from me to my son
In your behalf to meet you on the way
Be not taen tardy by unwise delay

DUCHESS
O illdispersing wind of misery
O my accursed womb the bed of death
A cockatrice hast thou hatchd to the world
Whose unavoided eye is murderous

STANLEY
Come madam come I in all haste was sent

ANNE
And I with all unwillingness will go
O would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were redhot steel to sear me to the brain 
Anointed let me be with deadly venom
And die ere men can say God save the queen

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Go go poor soul I envy not thy glory
To feed my humour wish thyself no harm

ANNE
No whyWhen he that is my husband now
Came to me as I followd Henrys corse
When scarce the blood was well washd from his hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dear saint which then I weeping followd
O when I say I lookd on Richards face
This was my wishBe thou quoth I accursd
For making me so young so old a widow
And when thou weddst let sorrow haunt thy bed
And be thy wifeif any be so mad
More miserable by the life of thee
Than thou hast made me by my dear lords death
Lo ere I can repeat this curse again
Within so small a time my womans heart
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
And provd the subject of mine own souls curse
Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest
For never yet one hour in his bed
Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep
But with his timorous dreams was still awakd
Besides he hates me for my father Warwick
And will no doubt shortly be rid of me

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Poor heart adieu I pity thy complaining

ANNE
No more than with my soul I mourn for yours

DORSET
Farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory

ANNE
Adieu poor soul that takst thy leave of it

DUCHESS
To DORSET
Go thou to Richmond and good fortune guide thee

To ANNE
Go thou to Richard and good angels tend thee

To QUEEN ELIZABETH
Go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee
I to my grave where peace and rest lie with me
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen
And each hours joy wreckd with a week of teen

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Stay yet look back with me unto the Tower
Pity you ancient stones those tender babes
Whom envy hath immurd within your walls
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones
Rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
For tender princes use my babies well
So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell

Exeunt

My lord

KING RICHARD
Knowst thou not any whom corrupting gold
Will tempt unto a close exploit of death

KING RICHARD
What is his name

His name my lord is Tyrrel

KING RICHARD

STANLEY

The Marquis Dorset as I hear is fled
To Richmond in the parts where he abides

KING RICHARD
Come hither Catesby rumour it abroad
That Anne my wife is very grievous sick
I will take order for her keeping close
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence daughter
The boy is foolish and I fear not him
Look how thou dreamstI say again give out
That Anne my queen is sick and like to die
About it for it stands me much upon
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me

Exit CATESBY

I must be married to my brothers daughter
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass
Murder her brothers and then marry her
Uncertain way of gain But I am in

Tearfalling pity dwells not in this eye

Have told me I being by that I should kill him

BUCKINGHAM
My lord your promise for the earldom

KING RICHARD
RichmondWhen last I was at Exeter

KING RICHARD

SCENE III London Another Room in the Palace

Enter TYRREL

TYRREL
The tyrannous and bloody act is done
The most arch deed of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of
Dighton and Forrest who I did suborn
To do this piece of ruthless butchery
Albeit they were fleshd villains bloody dogs
Melted with tenderness and mild compassion
Wept like two children in their deaths sad story
O thus quoth Dighton lay the gentle babes
Thus thus quoth Forrest girdling one another
Within their alabaster innocent arms
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk
And in their summer beauty kissd each other
A book of prayers on their pillow lay
Which once quoth Forrest almost changd my mind
But O the devilthere the villain stoppd
When Dighton thus told onWe smothered
The most replenished sweet work of nature
That from the prime creation eer she framed
Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
They could not speak and so I left them both
To bear this tidings to the bloody king
And here he comes

Enter KING RICHARD

All health my sovereign lord

KING RICHARD
Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news

TYRREL
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness be happy then
For it is done

KING RICHARD
But didst thou see them dead

TYRREL
I did my lord

KING RICHARD
And buried gentle Tyrrel

TYRREL
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them
But where to say the truth I do not know

KING RICHARD
Come to me Tyrrel soon at after supper
When thou shalt tell the process of their death
Meantime but think how I may do thee good
And be inheritor of thy desire
Farewell till then

TYRREL
I humbly take my leave

Exit

KING RICHARD
The son of Clarence have I pent up close
His daughter meanly have I matchd in marriage
The sons of Edward sleep in Abrahams bosom
And Anne my wife hath bid the world goodnight
Now for I know the Britagne Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth my brothers daughter
And by that knot looks proudly on the crown
To her go I a jolly thriving wooer

Enter RATCLIFF

RATCLIFF
My lord

KING RICHARD
Good or bad news that thou comst in so bluntly

RATCLIFF
Bad news my lord Morton is fled to Richmond
And Buckingham backd with the hardy Welshmen
Is in the field and still his power increaseth

KING RICHARD
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rashlevied strength
ComeI have learnd that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay
Delay leads impotent and snailpacd beggary
Then fiery expedition be my wing
Joves Mercury and herald for a king
Go muster men my counsel is my shield
We must be brief when traitors brave the field

Exeunt



SCENE IV London Before the Palace

Enter QUEEN MARGARET

QUEEN MARGARET
So now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death
Here in these confines slily have I lurkd
To watch the waning of mine enemies
A dire induction am I witness to
And will to France hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter black and tragical
Withdraw thee wretched Margaret who comes here

Retires

Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ah my poor princes ah my tender babes
My unblown flowers newappearing sweets
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fixd in doom perpetual
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your mothers lamentation

QUEEN MARGARET
Hover about her say that right for right
Hath dimmd your infant morn to aged night

DUCHESS
So many miseries have crazd my voice
That my woewearied tongue is still and mute
Edward Plantagenet why art thou dead

QUEEN MARGARET
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Wilt thou O God fly from such gentle lambs
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf
When didst Thou sleep when such a deed was done

QUEEN MARGARET
When holy Harry died and my sweet son

DUCHESS
Dead life blind sight poor mortal living ghost
Woes scene worlds shame graves due by life usurpd
Brief abstract and record of tedious days
Rest thy unrest on Englands lawful earth
Sitting down
Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ah that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat
Then would I hide my bones not rest them here
Ah who hath any cause to mourn but we
Sitting down by her

QUEEN MARGARET
Coming forward
If ancient sorrow be most reverent
Give mine the benefit of seniory
And let my griefs frown on the upper hand
If sorrow can admit society
Sitting down with them
Tell oer your woes again by viewing mine
I had an Edward till a Richard killd him
I had a Henry till a Richard killd him
Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killd him
Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killd him

DUCHESS
I had a Richard too and thou didst kill him
I had a Rutland too thou holpst to kill him

QUEEN MARGARET
Thou hadst a Clarence too and Richard killd him
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death
That dog that had his teeth before his eyes
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
That foul defacer of Gods handiwork
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
O upright just and truedisposing God
How do I thank Thee that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of his mothers body
And makes her pewfellow with others moan

DUCHESS
O Harrys wife triumph not in my woes
God witness with me I have wept for thine

QUEEN MARGARET
Bear with me I am hungry for revenge
And now I cloy me with beholding it
Thy Edward he is dead that killd my Edward
The other Edward dead to quit my Edward
Young York he is but boot because both they
Match not the high perfection of my loss
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbd my Edward
And the beholders of this frantic play
The adulterate Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey
Untimely smotherd in their dusky graves
Richard yet lives hells black intelligencer
Only reservd their factor to buy souls
And send them thither but at hand at hand
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end
Earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
To have him suddenly conveyd from hence
Cancel his bond of life dear God I pray
That I may live to say The dog is dead

QUEEN ELIZABETH
O thou didst prophesy the time would come
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider that foul bunchbackd toad

QUEEN MARGARET
I calld thee then vain flourish of my fortune
I calld thee then poor shadow painted queen
The presentation of but what I was
The flattering index of a direful pageant
One heavd ahigh to be hurld down below
A mother only mockd with two fair babes
A dream of what thou wast a garish flag
To be the aim of every dangerous shot
A sign of dignity a breath a bubble
A queen in jest only to fill the scene
Where is thy husband now where be thy brothers
Where be thy two sons wherein dost thou joy
Who sues and kneels and says God save the queen
Where be the bending peers that flatterd thee
Where be the thronging troops that followd thee
Decline all this and see what now thou art
For happy wife a most distressed widow
For joyful mother one that wails the name
For one being sud to one that humbly sues
For queen a very caitiff crownd with care
For she that scornd at me now scornd of me
For she being feard of all now fearing one
For she commanding all obeyd of none
Thus hath the course of justice wheeld about
And left thee but a very prey to time
Having no more but thought of what thou wast
To torture thee the more being what thou art
Thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
Now thy proud neck bears half my burdend yoke
From which even here I slip my weary head
And leave the burden of it all on thee
Farewell Yorks wife and queen of sad mischance
These English woes shall make me smile in France

QUEEN ELIZABETH
O thou well skilld in curses stay awhile
And teach me how to curse mine enemies

QUEEN MARGARET
Forbear to sleep the night and fast the day
Compare dead happiness with living woe
Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were
And he that slew them fouler than he is
Bettering thy loss makes the badcauser worse
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse

QUEEN ELIZABETH
My words are dull O quicken them with thine

QUEEN MARGARET
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine

Exit

DUCHESS
Why should calamity be full of words

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Windy attorneys to their client woes
Airy succeeders of intestate joys
Poor breathing orators of miseries
Let them have scope though what they do impart
Help nothing else yet do they ease the heart

DUCHESS
If so then be not tonguetied go with me
And in the breath of bitter words lets smother
My damned son that thy two sweet sons smotherd

Drum within

I hear his drumbe copious in exclaims

Enter KING RICHARD and his Train marching

KING RICHARD
Who intercepts me in my expedition

DUCHESS
O she that might have intercepted thee
By strangling thee in her accursed womb
From all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown
Where should be branded if that right were right
The slaughter of the prince that owd that crown
And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers
Tell me thou villainslave where are my children

DUCHESS
Thou toad thou toad where is thy brother Clarence
And little Ned Plantagenet his son

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Where is the gentle Rivers Vaughan Grey

DUCHESS
Where is kind Hastings

KING RICHARD
A flourish trumpets strike alarum drums
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women
Rail on the Lords anointed strike I say

Flourish Alarums

Either be patient and entreat me fair
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus will I drown your exclamations

DUCHESS
Art thou my son

KING RICHARD
Ay I thank God my father and yourself

DUCHESS
Then patiently hear my impatience

KING RICHARD
Madam I have a touch of your condition
That cannot brook the accent of reproof

DUCHESS
O let me speak

KING RICHARD
Do then but Ill not hear

DUCHESS
I will be mild and gentle in my words

KING RICHARD
And brief good mother for I am in haste

DUCHESS
Art thou so hasty I have stayd for thee
God knows in torment and in agony

KING RICHARD
And came I not at last to comfort you

DUCHESS
No by the holy rood thou knowst it well
Thou camst on earth to make the earth my hell
A grievous burden was thy birth to me
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
Thy schooldays frightful desperate wild and furious
Thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
Thy age confirmd proud subtle sly and bloody
More mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred
What comfortable hour canst thou name
That ever gracd me with thy company

KING RICHARD
Faith none but Humphrey Hour that calld your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company
If I be so disgracious in your eye
Let me march on and not offend you madam
Strike up the drum

DUCHESS
I prythee hear me speak

KING RICHARD
You speak too bitterly

DUCHESS
Hear me a word
For I shall never speak to thee again

KING RICHARD
So

DUCHESS
Either thou wilt die by Gods just ordinance
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never more behold thy face again
Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse
Which in the day of battle tire thee more
Than all the complete armour that thou wearst
My prayers on the adverse party fight
And there the little souls of Edwards children
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory
Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend

Exit

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me I say amen to her

Going

KING RICHARD
Stay madam I must talk a word with you

QUEEN ELIZABETH
I have no more sons of the royal blood
For thee to slaughter for my daughters Richard
They shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
And therefore level not to hit their lives

KING RICHARD
You have a daughter calld Elizabeth
Virtuous and fair royal and gracious

QUEEN ELIZABETH
And must she die for this O let her live
And Ill corrupt her manners stain her beauty
Slander myself as false to Edwards bed
Throw over her the veil of infamy
So she may live unscarrd of bleeding slaughter
I will confess she was not Edwards daughter

KING RICHARD
Wrong not her birth she is of royal blood

QUEEN ELIZABETH
To save her life Ill say she is not so

KING RICHARD
Her life is safest only in her birth

QUEEN ELIZABETH
And only in that safety died her brothers

KING RICHARD
Lo at their births good stars were opposite

QUEEN ELIZABETH
No to their lives bad friends were contrary

KING RICHARD
All unavoided is the doom of destiny

QUEEN ELIZABETH
True when avoided grace makes destiny
My babes were destined to a fairer death
If grace had blessd thee with a fairer life

KING RICHARD
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Cousins indeed and by their uncle cozend
Of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
Whose hand soever lancd their tender hearts
Thy head all indirectly gave direction
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
Till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart
To revel in the entrails of my lambs
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchord in thine eyes
And I in such a desperate bay of death
Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom

KING RICHARD
Madam so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars
As I intend more good to you and yours
Than ever you or yours by me were harmd

QUEEN ELIZABETH
What good is coverd with the face of heaven
To be discoverd that can do me good

KING RICHARD
Advancement of your children gentle lady

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Up to some scaffold there to lose their heads

KING RICHARD
Unto the dignity and height of honour
The high imperial type of this earths glory

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Flatter my sorrows with report of it
Tell me what state what dignity what honour
Canst thou demise to any child of mine

KING RICHARD
Even all I have ay and myself and all
Will I withal endow a child of thine
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I have done to thee

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Be brief lest that the process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness date

KING RICHARD
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter

QUEEN ELIZABETH
My daughters mother thinks it with her soul

KING RICHARD
What do you think

QUEEN ELIZABETH
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
So from thy souls love didst thou love her brothers
And from my hearts love I do thank thee for it

KING RICHARD
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
And do intend to make her Queen of England

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Well then who dost thou mean shall be her king

KING RICHARD
Even he that makes her queen who else should be

QUEEN ELIZABETH
What thou

KING RICHARD
I even I what think you of it madam

QUEEN ELIZABETH
How canst thou woo her

KING RICHARD
That would I learn of you
As one being best acquainted with her humour

QUEEN ELIZABETH
And wilt thou learn of me

KING RICHARD
Madam with all my heart

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Send to her by the man that slew her brothers
A pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave
Edward and York Then haply will she weep
Therefore present to heras sometimes Margaret
Did to thy father steepd in Rutlands blood
A handkerchief which say to her did drain
The purple sap from her sweet brothers bodies
And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal
If this inducement move her not to love
Send her a letter of thy noble deeds
Tell her thou madst away her uncle Clarence
Her uncle Rivers ay and for her sake
Madst quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne

KING RICHARD
You mock me madam this is not the way
To win your daughter

QUEEN ELIZABETH
There is no other way
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
And not be Richard that hath done all this

KING RICHARD
Say that I did all this for love of her

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil

KING RICHARD
Look what is done cannot be now amended
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
Which afterhours gives leisure to repent
If I did take the kingdom from your sons
To make amends Ill give it to your daughter
If I have killd the issue of your womb
To quicken your increase I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
A grandams name is little less in love
Than is the doating title of a mother
They are as children but one step below
Even of your mettle of your very blood
Of all one painsave for a night of groans
Endurd of her for whom you bid like sorrow
Your children were vexation to your youth
But mine shall be a comfort to your age
The loss you have is but a son being king
And by that loss your daughter is made queen
I cannot make you what amends I would
Therefore accept such kindness as I can
Dorset your son that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
To high promotions and great dignity
The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother
Again shall you be mother to a king
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repaird with double riches of content
What we have many goodly days to see
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again transformd to orient pearl
Advantaging their loan with interest
Of ten times double gain of happiness
Go then my mother to thy daughter go
Make bold her bashful years with your experience
Prepare her ears to hear a wooers tale
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel dullbraind Buckingham
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead thy daughter to a conquerors bed
To whom I will retail my conquest won
And she shall be sole victoress Caesars Caesar

QUEEN ELIZABETH
What were I best to say her fathers brother
Would be her lord or shall I say her uncle
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
Under what title shall I woo for thee
That God the law my honour and her love
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years

KING RICHARD
Infer fair Englands peace by this alliance

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Which she shall purchase with stilllasting war

KING RICHARD
Tell her the king that may command entreats

QUEEN ELIZABETH
That at her hands which the kings King forbids

KING RICHARD
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen

QUEEN ELIZABETH
To wail the title as her mother doth

KING RICHARD
Say I will love her everlastingly

QUEEN ELIZABETH
But how long shall that title ever last

KING RICHARD
Sweetly in force unto her fair lifes end

QUEEN ELIZABETH
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last

KING RICHARD
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it

QUEEN ELIZABETH
As long as hell and Richard likes of it

KING RICHARD
Say I her sovereign am her subject low

QUEEN ELIZABETH
But she your subject loathes such sovereignty

KING RICHARD
Be eloquent in my behalf to her

QUEEN ELIZABETH
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told

KING RICHARD
Then plainly to her tell my loving tale

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style

KING RICHARD
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick

QUEEN ELIZABETH
O no my reasons are too deep and dead
Too deep and dead poor infants in their graves

KING RICHARD
Harp not on that string madam that is past

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break

KING RICHARD
Now by my George my garter and my crown

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Profand dishonourd and the third usurpd

KING RICHARD
I swear

QUEEN ELIZABETH
By nothing for this is no oath
Thy George profand hath lost his lordly honour
Thy garter blemishd pawnd his knightly virtue
Thy crown usurpd disgracd his kingly glory
If something thou wouldst swear to be believd
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrongd

KING RICHARD
Now by the world

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Tis full of thy foul wrongs

KING RICHARD
My fathers death

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Thy life hath that dishonourd

KING RICHARD
Then by myself

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Thy self is selfmisusd

KING RICHARD
Why then by God

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Gods wrong is most of all
If thou hadst feard to break an oath by Him
The unity the king thy brother made
Had not been broken nor my brother slain
If thou hadst feard to break an oath by Him
The imperial metal circling now thy head
Had gracd the tender temples of my child
And both the princes had been breathing here
Which now two tender bedfellows for dust
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms
What canst thou swear by now

KING RICHARD
The time to come

QUEEN ELIZABETH
That thou hast wronged in the time oerpast
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time for time past wronged by thee
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughterd
Ungovernd youth to wail it in their age
The parents live whose children thou hast butcherd
Old barren plants to wail it with their age
Swear not by time to come for that thou hast
Misusd ere used by times illusd oerpast

KING RICHARD
As I intend to prosper and repent
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms myself myself confound
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
Day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedingif with pure hearts love
Immaculate devotion holy thoughts
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
In her consists my happiness and thine
Without her follows to myself and thee
Herself the land and many a Christian soul
Death desolation ruin and decay
It cannot be avoided but by this
It will not be avoided but by this
Therefore dear motherI must call you so
Be the attorney of my love to her
Plead what I will be not what I have been
Not my deserts but what I will deserve
Urge the necessity and state of times
And be not peevish found in great designs

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus

KING RICHARD
Ay if the devil tempt you to do good

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Shall I forget myself to be myself

KING RICHARD
Ay if your selfs remembrance wrong yourself

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Yet thou didst kill my children

KING RICHARD
But in your daughters womb I bury them
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
Selves of themselves to your recomforture

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will

KING RICHARD
And be a happy mother by the deed

QUEEN ELIZABETH
I goWrite to me very shortly
And you shall understand from me her mind

KING RICHARD
Bear her my true loves kiss and so farewell

Kissing her Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH

Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore

You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him I fear

STANLEY

Unto the shore to ask those on the banks
If they were his assistants yea or no
Who answerd him they came from Buckingham
Upon his party He mistrusting them
Hoisd sail and made his course again for Britagne

If not to fight with foreign enemies
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home

ACT V

SCENE I Salisbury An open place

Enter the Sheriff and Guard with BUCKINGHAM led to execution

BUCKINGHAM
Will not King Richard let me speak with him

SHERIFF
No my good lord therefore be patient

BUCKINGHAM
Hastings and Edwards children Grey and Rivers
Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward
Vaughan and all that have miscarried
By underhand corrupted foul injustice
If that your moody discontented souls
Do through the clouds behold this present hour
Even for revenge mock my destruction
This is AllSouls day fellow is it not

SHERIFF
It is my lord

BUCKINGHAM
Why then AllSouls day is my bodys doomsday
This is the day which in King Edwards time
I wishd might fall on me when I was found
False to his children and his wifes allies
This is the day wherein I wishd to fall
By the false faith of him whom most I trusted
This this AllSouls day to my fearful soul
Is the determind respite of my wrongs
That high AllSeer which I dallied with
Hath turnd my feigned prayer on my head
And given in earnest what I beggd in jest
Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men
To turn their own points in their masters bosoms
Thus Margarets curse falls heavy on my neck
When he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow
Remember Margaret was a prophetess
Come lead me officers to the block of shame
Wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame

Exeunt



SCENE II Plain near Tamworth

Enter with drum and colours RICHMOND OXFORD SIR JAMES BLUNT
SIR WALTER HERBERT and others with Forces marching

RICHMOND
Fellows in arms and my most loving friends
Bruisd underneath the yoke of tyranny
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Have we marchd on without impediment
And here receive we from our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement
The wretched bloody and usurping boar
That spoild your summer fields and fruitful vines
Swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough
In your embowelld bosomsthis foul swine
Lies now even in the centre of this isle
Near to the town of Leicester as we learn
From Tamworth thither is but one days march
In Gods name cheerly on courageous friends
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war

OXFORD
Every mans conscience is a thousand swords
To fight against that bloody homicide

HERBERT
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us

BLUNT
He hath no friends but what are friends for fear
Which in his dearest need will fly from him

RICHMOND
All for our vantage Then in Gods name march
True hope is swift and flies with swallows wings
Kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings

STANLEY
I by attorney bless thee from thy mother
Who prays continually for Richmonds good
So much for thatThe silent hours steal on
And flaky darkness breaks within the east
In brieffor so the season bids us be
Prepare thy battle early in the morning
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortalstaring war
I as I maythat which I would I cannot
With best advantage will deceive the time
And aid thee in this doubtful stroke of arms
But on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest being seen thy brother tender George
Be executed in his fathers sight
Farewell the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse
Which solongsunderd friends should dwell upon
God give us leisure for these rites of love
Once more adieu be valiant and speed well

RICHMOND
Good lords conduct him to his regiment
Ill strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap
Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow
When I should mount with wings of victory
Once more good night kind lords and gentlemen

Exeunt Lords c with STANLEY

O Thou Whose captain I account myself
Look on my forces with a gracious eye
Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversaries
Make us Thy ministers of chastisement
That we may praise Thee in Thy victory
To Thee I do commend my watchful soul
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes
Sleeping and waking O defend me still

KING RICHARD
Give me another horsebind up my wounds
Have mercy JesuSoft I did but dream
O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me
The lights burn blueIt is now dead midnight
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh
What do I fear myself theres none else by
Richard loves Richard that is I am I
Is there a murderer here Noyes I am
Then fly What from myself Great reason why
Lest I revenge Whatmyself upon myself
Alack I love myself Wherefore for any good
That I myself have done unto myself
O no alas I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself
I am a villain yet I lie I am not
Fool of thyself speak wellfool do not flatter
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues
And every tongue brings in a several tale
And every tale condemns me for a villain
Perjury perjury in the highst degree
Murder stern murder in the dirst degree
All several sins all usd in each degree
Throng to the bar crying all Guilty guilty
I shall despair There is no creature loves me
And if I die no soul will pity me
And wherefore should theysince that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself
Methought the souls of all that I had murderd
Came to my tent and every one did threat
Tomorrows vengeance on the head of Richard

Enter RATCLIFF

RATCLIFF
My lord

KING RICHARD
Whos there

RATCLIFF

O Ratcliff I have dreamd a fearful dream
What thinkst thouwill our friends prove all true

RATCLIFF
No doubt my lord

KING RICHARD
O Ratcliff I fear I fear

RATCLIFF
Nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows

KING RICHARD
By the apostle Paul shadows tonight
Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond
It is not yet near day Come go with me
Under our tents Ill play the eavesdropper
To see if any mean to shrink from me

Exeunt KING RICHARD and RATCLIFF

RICHMOND wakes Enter OXFORD and others

LORDS
Good morrow Richmond

RICHMOND
Cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen
That you have taen a tardy sluggard here

LORDS
How have you slept my lord

RICHMOND
The sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams
That ever enterd in a drowsy head
Have I since your departure had my lords
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murderd
Came to my tent and cried on victory
I promise you my heart is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream
How far into the morning is it lords

LORDS
Upon the stroke of four

RICHMOND
Why then tis time to arm and give direction

He advances to the Troops

More than I have said loving countrymen
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell on yet remember this
God and our good cause fight upon our side
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
Like highreard bulwarks stand before our faces
Richard except those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow
For what is he they follow truly gentlemen
A bloody tyrant and a homicide
One raisd in blood and one in blood establishd
One that made means to come by what he hath
And slaughterd those that were the means to help him
A base foul stone made precious by the foil
Of Englands chair where he is falsely set
One that hath ever been Gods enemy
Then if you fight against Gods enemy
God will in justice ward you as His soldiers
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down
You sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
If you do fight against your countrys foes
Your countrys fat shall pay your pains the hire
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
If you do free your children from the sword
Your childrens children quit it in your age
Then in the name of God and all these rights
Advance your standards draw your willing swords
For me the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earths cold face
But if I thrive the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully
God and Saint George Richmond and victory

Exeunt

Reenter KING RICHARD RATCLIFF Attendants and Forces

RATCLIFF
That he was never trained up in arms

KING RICHARD
He said the truth and what said Surrey then

RATCLIFF
He smild and said the better for our purpose

KING RICHARD
He was in the right and so indeed it is

Clock strikes

Tell the clock thereGive me a calendar
Who saw the sun today

RATCLIFF
Not I my lord

KING RICHARD
Then he disdains to shine for by the book
He should have bravd the east an hour ago
A black day will it be to somebody
Ratcliff

RATCLIFF
My lord

KING RICHARD
The sun will not be seen today
The sky doth frown and lower upon our army
I would these dewy tears were from the ground
Not shine today Why what is that to me
More than to Richmond for the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him

Enter NORFOLK

NORFOLK
Arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field

KING RICHARD
Come bustle bustle caparison my horse
Call up Lord Stanley bid him bring his power
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain
And thus my battle shall be ordered
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length
Consisting equally of horse and foot
Our archers shall be placed in the midst
John Duke of Norfolk Thomas Earl of Surrey
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse
They thus directed we will follow
In the main battle whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse
This and Saint George to bootWhat thinkst thou
Norfolk

NORFOLK
A good direction warlike sovereign
This found I on my tent this morning

Giving a scroll

KING RICHARD
Reads Jockey of Norfolk be not too bold
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold
A thing devised by the enemy
Go gentlemen every man unto his charge
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls
Conscience is but a word that cowards use
Devisd at first to keep the strong in awe
Our strong arms be our conscience swords our law
March on join bravely let us tot pellmell
If not to heaven then hand in hand to hell
What shall I say more than I have inferrd
Remember whom you are to cope withal
A sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways
A scum of Britagnes and base lackey peasants
Whom their oercloyed country vomits forth
To desperate adventures and assurd destruction
You sleeping safe they bring to you unrest
You having lands and blessd with beauteous wives
They would restrain the one distain the other
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow
Long kept in Britagne at our mothers cost
A milksop one that never in his life
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow
Lets whip these stragglers oer the seas again
Lash hence these overweening rags of France
These famishd beggars weary of their lives
Who but for dreaming on this fond exploit
For want of means poor rats had hangd themselves
If we be conquered let men conquer us
And not these bastard Britagnes whom our fathers
Have in their own land beaten bobbd and thumpd
And on record left them the heirs of shame
Shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives
Ravish our daughtersHark I hear their drum
Drum afar off
Fight gentlemen of England fight bold yeomen
Draw archers draw your arrows to the head
Spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves

Enter a MESSENGER

What says Lord Stanley will he bring his power

MESSENGER
My lord he doth deny to come

KING RICHARD
Off with his son Georges head

NORFOLK
My lord the enemy is passd the marsh

Advance our standards set upon our foes

Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons
Upon them Victory sits on our helms

And then as we have taen the sacrament
We will unite the white rose and the red
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction
That long have frownd upon their emnity
What traitor hears me and says not Amen
England hath long been mad and scarrd herself
The brother blindly shed the brothers blood
The father rashly slaughterd his own son
The son compelld been butcher to the sire
All this divided York and Lancaster
Divided in their dire division
O now let Richmond and Elizabeth
The true succeeders of each royal house
By Gods fair ordinance conjoin together
And let their heirsGod if Thy will be so
Enrich the time to come with smoothdfacd peace
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord
That would reduce these bloody days again
And make poor England weep in streams of blood
Let them not live to taste this lands increase
That would with treason wound this fair lands peace
Now civil wounds are stoppd peace lives again
That she may long live here God say Amen
