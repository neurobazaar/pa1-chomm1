 INDUCTION
 Warkworth Before NORTHUMBERLANDS Castle

 Enter RUMOUR painted full of tongues

 RUMOUR Open your ears for which of you will stop
 The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks
 I from the orient to the drooping west
 Making the wind my posthorse still unfold
 The acts commenced on this ball of earth
 Upon my tongues continual slanders ride
 The which in every language I pronounce
 Stuffing the ears of men with false reports
 I speak of peace while covert emnity
 Under the smile of safety wounds the world
 And who but Rumour who but only I
 Make fearful musters and prepard defence
 Whiles the big year swoln with some other grief
 Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war
 And no such matter Rumour is a pipe
 Blown by surmises jealousies conjectures
 And of so easy and so plain a stop
 That the blunt monster with uncounted heads
 The stilldiscordant wavring multitude
 Can play upon it But what need I thus
 My wellknown body to anatomize
 Among my household Why is Rumour here
 I run before King Harrys victory
 Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
 Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops
 Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
 Even with the rebels blood But what mean I
 To speak so true at first My office is
 To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
 Under the wrath of noble Hotspurs sword
 And that the King before the Douglas rage
 Stoopd his anointed head as low as death
 This have I rumourd through the peasant towns
 Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
 And this wormeaten hold of ragged stone
 Where Hotspurs father old Northumberland
 Lies craftysick The posts come tiring on
 And not a man of them brings other news
 Than they have learnt of me From Rumours tongues
 They bring smooth comforts false worse than true wrongs
 Exit

ACT I SCENE I
Warkworth Before NORTHUMBERLANDS Castle

Enter LORD BARDOLPH

 LORD BARDOLPH Who keeps the gate here ho

 The PORTER opens the gate

 Where is the Earl
 PORTER What shall I say you are
 LORD BARDOLPH Tell thou the Earl
 That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here
 PORTER His lordship is walkd forth into the orchard
 Please it your honour knock but at the gate
 And he himself will answer

 Enter NORTHUMBERLAND

 LORD BARDOLPH Here comes the Earl Exit PORTER
 NORTHUMBERLAND What news Lord Bardolph Every minute now
 Should be the father of some stratagem
 The times are wild contention like a horse
 Full of high feeding madly hath broke loose
 And bears down all before him
 LORD BARDOLPH Noble Earl
 I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury
 NORTHUMBERLAND Good an God will
 LORD BARDOLPH As good as heart can wish
 The King is almost wounded to the death
 And in the fortune of my lord your son
 Prince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts
 Killd by the hand of Douglas young Prince John
 And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field
 And Harry Monmouths brawn the hulk Sir John
 Is prisoner to your son O such a day
 So fought so followed and so fairly won
 Came not till now to dignify the times
 Since Cxsars fortunes
 NORTHUMBERLAND How is this derivd
 Saw you the field Came you from Shrewsbury
 LORD BARDOLPH I spake with one my lord that came from
thence
 A gentleman well bred and of good name
 That freely rendred me these news for true

 Enter TRAVERS

 NORTHUMBERLAND Here comes my servant Travers whom I sent
 On Tuesday last to listen after news
 LORD BARDOLPH My lord I overrode him on the way
 And he is furnishd with no certainties
 More than he haply may retail from me
 NORTHUMBERLAND Now Travers what good tidings comes with you
 TRAVERS My lord Sir John Umfrevile turnd me back
 With joyful tidings and being better horsd
 Outrode me After him came spurring hard
 A gentleman almost forspent with speed
 That stoppd by me to breathe his bloodied horse
 He askd the way to Chester and of him
 I did demand what news from Shrewsbury
 He told me that rebellion had bad luck
 And that young Harry Percys spur was cold
 With that he gave his able horse the head
 And bending forward struck his armed heels
 Against the panting sides of his poor jade
 Up to the rowelhead and starting so
 He seemd in running to devour the way
 Staying no longer question
 NORTHUMBERLAND Ha Again
 Said he young Harry Percys spur was cold
 Of Hotspur Coldspur that rebellion
 Had met ill luck
 LORD BARDOLPH My lord Ill tell you what
 If my young lord your son have not the day
 Upon mine honour for a silken point
 Ill give my barony Never talk of it
 NORTHUMBERLAND Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
 Give then such instances of loss
 LORD BARDOLPH Who he
 He was some hilding fellow that had stoln
 The horse he rode on and upon my life
 Spoke at a venture Look here comes more news

 Enter Morton

 NORTHUMBERLAND Yea this mans brow like to a titleleaf
 Foretells the nature of a tragic volume
 So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
 Hath left a witnessd usurpation
 Say Morton didst thou come from Shrewsbury
 MORTON I ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord
 Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
 To fright our party
 NORTHUMBERLAND How doth my son and brother
 Thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
 Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
 Even such a man so faint so spiritless
 So dull so dread in look so woebegone
 Drew Priams curtain in the dead of night
 And would have told him half his Troy was burnt
 But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue
 And I my Percys death ere thou reportst it
 This thou wouldst say Your son did thus and thus
 Your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas
 Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
 But in the end to stop my ear indeed
 Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
 Ending with Brother son and all are dead
 MORTON Douglas is living and your brother yet
 But for my lord your son
 NORTHUMBERLAND Why he is dead
 See what a ready tongue suspicion hath
 He that but fears the thing he would not know
 Hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes
 That what he feard is chanced Yet speak Morton
 Tell thou an earl his divination lies
 And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
 And make thee rich for doing me such wrong
 MORTON You are too great to be by me gainsaid
 Your spirit is too true your fears too certain
 NORTHUMBERLAND Yet for all this say not that Percys dead
 I see a strange confession in thine eye
 Thou shakst thy head and holdst it fear or sin
 To speak a truth If he be slain say so
 The tongue offends not that reports his death
 And he doth sin that doth belie the dead
 Not he which says the dead is not alive
 Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
 Hath but a losing office and his tongue
 Sounds ever after as a sullen bell
 Remembred tolling a departing friend
 LORD BARDOLPH I cannot think my lord your son is dead
 MORTON I am sorry I should force you to believe
 That which I would to God I had not seen
 But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
 Rendring faint quittance wearied and outbreathd
 To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
 The neverdaunted Percy to the earth
 From whence with life he never more sprung up
 In few his death whose spirit lent a fire
 Even to the dullest peasant in his camp
 Being bruited once took fire and heat away
 From the besttemperd courage in his troops
 For from his metal was his party steeled
 Which once in him abated an the rest
 Turnd on themselves like dull and heavy lead
 And as the thing thats heavy in itself
 Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
 So did our men heavy in Hotspurs loss
 Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
 That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
 Than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
 Fly from the field Then was that noble Worcester
 Too soon taen prisoner and that furious Scot
 The bloody Douglas whose welllabouring sword
 Had three times slain th appearance of the King
 Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
 Of those that turnd their backs and in his flight
 Stumbling in fear was took The sum of all
 Is that the King hath won and hath sent out
 A speedy power to encounter you my lord
 Under the conduct of young Lancaster
 And Westmoreland This is the news at full
 NORTHUMBERLAND For this I shall have time enough to mourn
 In poison there is physic and these news
 Having been well that would have made me sick
 Being sick have in some measure made me well
 And as the wretch whose feverweakned joints
 Like strengthless hinges buckle under life
 Impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
 Out of his keepers arms even so my limbs
 Weakned with grief being now enragd with grief
 Are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch
 A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
 Must glove this hand and hence thou sickly coif
 Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
 Which princes fleshd with conquest aim to hit
 Now bind my brows with iron and approach
 The raggedst hour that time and spite dare bring
 To frown upon th enragd Northumberland
 Let heaven kiss earth Now let not Natures hand
 Keep the wild flood confind Let order die
 And let this world no longer be a stage
 To feed contention in a lingring act
 But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain
 Reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
 On bloody courses the rude scene may end
 And darkness be the burier of the dead
 LORD BARDOLPH This strained passion doth you wrong my lord
 MORTON Sweet Earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
 The lives of all your loving complices
 Lean on your health the which if you give oer
 To stormy passion must perforce decay
 You cast th event of war my noble lord
 And summd the account of chance before you said
 Let us make head It was your presurmise
 That in the dole of blows your son might drop
 You knew he walkd oer perils on an edge
 More likely to fall in than to get oer
 You were advisd his flesh was capable
 Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
 Would lift him where most trade of danger rangd
 Yet did you say Go forth and none of this
 Though strongly apprehended could restrain
 The stiffborne action What hath then befalln
 Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
 More than that being which was like to be
 LORD BARDOLPH We all that are engaged to this loss
 Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
 That if we wrought out life twas ten to one
 And yet we venturd for the gain proposd
 Chokd the respect of likely peril feard
 And since we are oerset venture again
 Come we will put forth body and goods
 MORTON Tis more than time And my most noble lord
 I hear for certain and dare speak the truth
 The gentle Archbishop of York is up
 With wellappointed powrs He is a man
 Who with a double surety binds his followers
 My lord your son had only but the corpse
 But shadows and the shows of men to fight
 For that same word rebellion did divide
 The action of their bodies from their souls
 And they did fight with queasiness constraind
 As men drink potions that their weapons only
 Seemd on our side but for their spirits and souls
 This word rebellion it had froze them up
 As fish are in a pond But now the Bishop
 Turns insurrection to religion
 Supposd sincere and holy in his thoughts
 Hes followd both with body and with mind
 And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
 Of fair King Richard scrapd from Pomfret stones
 Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
 Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
 Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke
 And more and less do flock to follow him
 NORTHUMBERLAND I knew of this before but to speak truth
 This present grief had wipd it from my mind
 Go in with me and counsel every man
 The aptest way for safety and revenge
 Get posts and letters and make friends with speed
 Never so few and never yet more need Exeunt




SCENE II
London A street

Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF with his PAGE bearing his sword and
buckler

 FALSTAFF Sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water
 PAGE He said sir the water itself was a good healthy water
but
 for the party that owed it he might have moe diseases than
he
 knew for
 FALSTAFF Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me The
brain of
 this foolishcompounded clay man is not able to invent
anything
 that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented
on
 me I am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is
in
 other men I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath
 overwhelmd all her litter but one If the Prince put thee
into
 my service for any other reason than to set me off why then
I
 have no judgment Thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to
be
 worn in my cap than to wait at my heels I was never mannd
with
 an agate till now but I will inset you neither in gold nor
 silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your
 master for a jewel the juvenal the Prince your master
whose
 chin is not yet fledge I will sooner have a beard grow in
the
 palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek and yet
he
 will not stick to say his face is a faceroyal God may
finish it
 when he will tis not a hair amiss yet He may keep it still
at
 a faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of
it
 and yet hell be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his
 father was a bachelor He may keep his own grace but hes
almost
 out of mine I can assure him What said Master Dommelton
about
 the satin for my short cloak and my slops
 PAGE He said sir you should procure him better assurance
than
 Bardolph He would not take his band and yours he liked not
the
 security
 FALSTAFF Let him be damnd like the Glutton pray God his
tongue
 be hotter A whoreson Achitophel A rascalyeaforsooth
knave to
 bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security The
 whoreson smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and
 bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through
with
 them in honest takingup then they must stand upon security
I
 had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to
stop
 it with security I lookd a should have sent me two and
twenty
 yards of satin as I am a true knight and he sends me
security
 Well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of
 abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it
and
 yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light
him
 Wheres Bardolph
 PAGE Hes gone into Smithfield to buy your worship horse
 FALSTAFF I bought him in Pauls and hell buy me a horse in
 Smithfield An I could get me but a wife in the stews I were
 mannd horsd and wivd

 Enter the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT

 PAGE Sir here comes the nobleman that committed the
 Prince for striking him about Bardolph
 FALSTAFF Wait close I will not see him
 CHIEF JUSTICE Whats he that goes there
 SERVANT Falstaff ant please your lordship
 CHIEF JUSTICE He that was in question for the robbry
 SERVANT He my lord but he hath since done good service at
 Shrewsbury and as I hear is now going with some charge to
the
 Lord John of Lancaster
 CHIEF JUSTICE What to York Call him back again
 SERVANT Sir John Falstaff
 FALSTAFF Boy tell him I am deaf
 PAGE You must speak louder my master is deaf
 CHIEF JUSTICE I am sure he is to the hearing of anything
good
 Go pluck him by the elbow I must speak with him
 SERVANT Sir John
 FALSTAFF What a young knave and begging Is there not wars
Is
 there not employment Doth not the King lack subjects Do not
the
 rebels need soldiers Though it be a shame to be on any side
but
 one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side
were
 it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it
 SERVANT You mistake me sir
 FALSTAFF Why sir did I say you were an honest man Setting
my
 knighthood and my soldiership aside I had lied in my throat
if I
 had said so
 SERVANT I pray you sir then set your knighthood and your
 soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you in your
 throat if you say I am any other than an honest man
 FALSTAFF I give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside that
which
 grows to me If thou getst any leave of me hang me if thou
 takst leave thou wert better be hangd You hunt counter
 Hence Avaunt
 SERVANT Sir my lord would speak with you
 CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John Falstaff a word with you
 FALSTAFF My good lord God give your lordship good time of
day I
 am glad to see your lordship abroad I heard say your
lordship
 was sick I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice Your
 lordship though not clean past your youth hath yet some
smack
 of age in you some relish of the saltness of time and I
most
 humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your
 health
 CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John I sent for you before your expedition
to
 Shrewsbury
 FALSTAFF Ant please your lordship I hear his Majesty is
returnd
 with some discomfort from Wales
 CHIEF JUSTICE I talk not of his Majesty You would not come
when I
 sent for you
 FALSTAFF And I hear moreover his Highness is falln into
this
 same whoreson apoplexy
 CHIEF JUSTICE Well God mend him I pray you let me speak with
you
 FALSTAFF This apoplexy as I take it is a kind of lethargy
ant
 please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a
whoreson
 tingling
 CHIEF JUSTICE What tell you me of it Be it as it is
 FALSTAFF It hath it original from much grief from study and
 perturbation of the brain I have read the cause of his
effects
 in Galen it is a kind of deafness
 CHIEF JUSTICE I think you are falln into the disease for you
 hear not what I say to you
 FALSTAFF Very well my lord very well Rather ant please
you it
 is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking
that
 I am troubled withal
 CHIEF JUSTICE To punish you by the heels would amend the
attention
 of your ears and I care not if I do become your physician
 FALSTAFF I am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient
Your
 lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in
respect
 of poverty but how I should be your patient to follow your
 prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or
 indeed a scruple itself
 CHIEF JUSTICE I sent for you when there were matters against
you
 for your life to come speak with me
 FALSTAFF As I was then advisd by my learned counsel in the
laws
 of this landservice I did not come
 CHIEF JUSTICE Well the truth is Sir John you live in great
 infamy
 FALSTAFF He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in
less
 CHIEF JUSTICE Your means are very slender and your waste is
 great
 FALSTAFF I would it were otherwise I would my means were
greater
 and my waist slenderer
 CHIEF JUSTICE You have misled the youthful Prince
 FALSTAFF The young Prince hath misled me I am the fellow with
the
 great belly and he my dog
 CHIEF JUSTICE Well I am loath to gall a newheald wound
Your
 days service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your
 nights exploit on Gadshill You may thank th unquiet time
for
 your quiet oerposting that action
 FALSTAFF My lord
 CHIEF JUSTICE But since all is well keep it so wake not a
 sleeping wolf
 FALSTAFF To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox
 CHIEF JUSTICE What you are as a candle the better part burnt
 out
 FALSTAFF A wassail candle my lord all tallow if I did say
of
 wax my growth would approve the truth
 CHIEF JUSTICE There is not a white hair in your face but
should
 have his effect of gravity
 FALSTAFF His effect of gravy gravy
 CHIEF JUSTICE You follow the young Prince up and down like
his
 ill angel
 FALSTAFF Not so my lord Your ill angel is light but hope
he
 that looks upon me will take me without weighing And yet in
some
 respects I grant I cannot go I cannot tell Virtue is of
so
 little regard in these costermongers times that true valour
is
 turnd berod pregnancy is made a tapster and his quick wit
 wasted in giving reckonings all the other gifts appertinent
to
 man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a
 gooseberry You that are old consider not the capacities of
us
 that are young you do measure the heat of our livers with
the
 bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of
our
 youth must confess are wags too
 CHIEF JUSTICE Do you set down your name in the scroll of
youth
 that are written down old with all the characters of age
Have
 you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white
beard a
 decreasing leg an increasing belly Is not your voice
broken
 your wind short your chin double your wit single and every
 part about you blasted with antiquity And will you yet call
 yourself young Fie fie fie Sir John
 FALSTAFF My lord I was born about three of the clock in the
 afternoon with a white head and something a round belly For
my
 voice I have lost it with hallooing and singing of anthems
To
 approve my youth further I will not The truth is I am only
old
 in judgment and understanding and he that will caper with me
for
 a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him
For
 the box of the ear that the Prince gave you he gave it like
a
 rude prince and you took it like a sensible lord I have
checkd
 him for it and the young lion repents marry not in ashes
and
 sackcloth but in new silk and old sack
 CHIEF JUSTICE Well God send the Prince a better companion
 FALSTAFF God send the companion a better prince I cannot rid
my
 hands of him
 CHIEF JUSTICE Well the King hath severd you I hear you are
 going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and
the
 Earl of Northumberland
 FALSTAFF Yea I thank your pretty sweet wit for it But look
you
 pray all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home that our
armies
 join not in a hot day for by the Lord I take but two
shirts
 out with me and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily If it
be a
 hot day and I brandish anything but a bottle I would I

 perpetual motion
 CHIEF JUSTICE Well be honest be honest and God bless your

SCENE III
York The ARCHBISHOPS palace

Enter the ARCHBISHOP THOMAS MOWBRAY the EARL MARSHAL LORD
HASTINGS
and LORD BARDOLPH

 ARCHBISHOP Thus have you heard our cause and known our means
 And my most noble friends I pray you all
 Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
 And first Lord Marshal what say you to it
 MOWBRAY I well allow the occasion of our amis
 But gladly would be better satisfied
 How in our means we should advance ourselves
 To look with forehead bold and big enough
 Upon the power and puissance of the King
 HASTINGS Our present musters grow upon the file
 To five and twenty thousand men of choice
 And our supplies live largely in the hope
 Of great Northumberland whose bosom burns
 With an incensed fire of injuries
 LORD BARDOLPH The question then Lord Hastings standeth thus
 Whether our present five and twenty thousand
 May hold up head without Northumberland
 HASTINGS With him we may
 LORD BARDOLPH Yea marry theres the point
 But if without him we be thought too feeble
 My judgment is we should not step too far
 Till we had his assistance by the hand
 For in a theme so bloodyfacd as this
 Conjecture expectation and surmise
 Of aids incertain should not be admitted
 ARCHBISHOP Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed
 It was young Hotspurs case at Shrewsbury
 LORD BARDOLPH It was my lord who lind himself with hope
 Eating the air and promise of supply
 Flattring himself in project of a power
 Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
 And so with great imagination
 Proper to madmen led his powers to death
 And winking leapt into destruction
 HASTINGS But by your leave it never yet did hurt
 To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope
 LORD BARDOLPH Yes if this present quality of war
 Indeed the instant action a cause on foot
 Lives so in hope as in an early spring
 We see th appearing buds which to prove fruit
 Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
 That frosts will bite them When we mean to build
 We first survey the plot then draw the model
 And when we see the figure of the house
 Then we must rate the cost of the erection
 Which if we find outweighs ability
 What do we then but draw anew the model
 In fewer offices or at least desist
 To build at all Much more in this great work
 Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
 And set another up should we survey
 The plot of situation and the model
 Consent upon a sure foundation
 Question surveyors know our own estate
 How able such a work to undergo
 To weigh against his opposite or else
 We fortify in paper and in figures
 Using the names of men instead of men
 Like one that draws the model of a house
 Beyond his power to build it who half through
 Gives oer and leaves his partcreated cost
 A naked subject to the weeping clouds
 And waste for churlish winters tyranny
 HASTINGS Grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
 Should be stillborn and that we now possessd
 The utmost man of expectation
 I think we are so a body strong enough
 Even as we are to equal with the King
 LORD BARDOLPH What is the King but five and twenty thousand
 HASTINGS To us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph
 For his divisions as the times do brawl
 Are in three heads one power against the French
 And one against Glendower perforce a third
 Must take up us So is the unfirm King
 In three divided and his coffers sound
 With hollow poverty and emptiness
 ARCHBISHOP That he should draw his several strengths together
 And come against us in full puissance
 Need not be dreaded
 HASTINGS If he should do so
 He leaves his back unarmd the French and Welsh
 Baying at his heels Never fear that
 LORD BARDOLPH Who is it like should lead his forces hither
 HASTINGS The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland
 Against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth
 But who is substituted against the French
 I have no certain notice
 ARCHBISHOP Let us on
 And publish the occasion of our arms
 The commonwealth is sick of their own choice
 Their overgreedy love hath surfeited
 An habitation giddy and unsure
 Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
 O thou fond many with what loud applause
 Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke
 Before he was what thou wouldst have him be
 And being now trimmd in thine own desires
 Thou beastly feeder art so full of him
 That thou provokst thyself to cast him up
 So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
 Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard
 And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
 And howlst to find it What trust is in these times
 They that when Richard livd would have him die
 Are now become enamourd on his grave
 Thou that threwst dust upon his goodly head
 When through proud London he came sighing on
 After th admired heels of Bolingbroke
 Criest now O earth yield us that king again
 And take thou this O thoughts of men accursd
 Past and to come seems best things present worst
 MOWBRAY Shall we go draw our numbers and set on
 HASTINGS We are times subjects and time bids be gone
 Exeunt

SCENE II
London Another street

Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS

 PRINCE Before God I am exceeding weary
 POINS Ist come to that I had thought weariness durst not
have
 attachd one of so high blood
 PRINCE Faith it does me though it discolours the complexion
of
 my greatness to acknowledge it Doth it not show vilely in me
to
 desire small beer
 POINS Why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to
 remember so weak a composition
 PRINCE Belike then my appetite was notprincely got for by
my
 troth I do now remember the poor creature small beer But
 indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with
my
 greatness What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name
or
 to know thy face tomorrow or to take note how many pair of
silk
 stockings thou hast viz these and those that were thy
 peachcolourd ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts
as
 one for superfluity and another for use But that the
 tenniscourtkeeper knows better than I for it is a low ebb
of
 linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou
hast
 not done a great while because the rest of thy low countries
 have made a shift to eat up thy holland And God knows
whether
 those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit
his
 kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the
fault
 whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily
 strengthened
 POINS How ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you
 should talk so idly Tell me how many good young princes
would
 do so their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is
 PRINCE Shall I tell thee one thing Poins
 POINS Yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing
 PRINCE It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than
thine
 POINS Go to I stand the push of your one thing that you will
 tell
 PRINCE Marry I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad
now
 my father is sick albeit I could tell to thee as to one it
 pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend I could
be
 sad and sad indeed too
 POINS Very hardly upon such a subject
 PRINCE By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devils
book
 as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the
end
 try the man But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my
 father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art
hath
 in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow
 POINS The reason
 PRINCE What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep
 POINS I would think thee a most princely hypocrite
 PRINCE It would be every mans thought and thou art a blessed
 fellow to think as every man thinks Never a mans thought in
the
 world keeps the roadway better than thine Every man would
think
 me an hypocrite indeed And what accites your most worshipful
 thought to think so
 POINS Why because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed
to
 Falstaff
 PRINCE And to thee
 POINS By this light I am well spoke on I can hear it with
mine
 own ears The worst that they can say of me is that I am a
second
 brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands and those
two
 things I confess I cannot help By the mass here comes
 Bardolph

 Enter BARDOLPH and PAGE

 PRINCE And the boy that I gave Falstaff A had him from me
 Christian and look if the fat villain have not transformd
him
 ape
 BARDOLPH God save your Grace
 PRINCE And yours most noble Bardolph
 POINS Come you virtuous ass you bashful fool must you be
 blushing Wherefore blush you now What a maidenly
manatarms
 are you become Ist such a matter to get a pottlepots
 maidenhead
 PAGE A calls me een now my lord through a red lattice and
I
 could discern no part of his face from the window At last I
 spied his eyes and methought he had made two holes in the
 alewifes new petticoat and so peepd through
 PRINCE Has not the boy profited
 BARDOLPH Away you whoreson upright rabbit away
 PAGE Away you rascally Althaeas dream away
 PRINCE Instruct us boy what dream boy
 PAGE Marry my lord Althaea dreamt she was delivered of a
 firebrand and therefore I call him her dream
 PRINCE A crowns worth of good interpretation There tis
boy
 Giving a crown
 POINS O that this blossom could be kept from cankers
 Well there is sixpence to preserve thee
 BARDOLPH An you do not make him be hangd among you the
gallows
 shall have wrong
 PRINCE And how doth thy master Bardolph
 BARDOLPH Well my lord He heard of your Graces coming to
town
 Theres a letter for you
 POINS Deliverd with good respect And how doth the martlemas
 your master
 BARDOLPH In bodily health sir
 POINS Marry the immortal part needs a physician but that
moves
 not him Though that be sick it dies not
 PRINCE I do allow this well to be as familiar with me as my
dog
 and he holds his place for look you how he writes
 POINS Reads John Falstaff knight Every man must know
that
 as oft as he has occasion to name himself even like those
that
 are kin to the King for they never prick their finger but
they
 say Theres some of the Kings blood spilt How comes
that
 says he that takes upon him not to conceive The answer is as
 ready as a borrowers cap I am the Kings poor cousin
sir
 PRINCE Nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it from
 Japhet But the letter Reads Sir John Falstaff knight
to
 the son of the King nearest his father Harry Prince of
Wales
 greeting
 POINS Why this is a certificate
 PRINCE Peace Reads I will imitate the honourable Romans
in
 brevity
 POINS He sure means brevity in breath shortwinded
 PRINCE Reads I commend me to thee I commend thee and I
 leave thee Be not too familiar with Poins for he misuses
thy
 favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister
Nell
 Repent at idle times as thou mayst and so farewell
 Thine by yea and no which is as much as to say as
 thou usest him JACK FALSTAFF with my familiars
 JOHN with my brothers and sisters and SIR JOHN with
 all Europe
 POINS My lord Ill steep this letter in sack and make him eat
it
 PRINCE Thats to make him eat twenty of his words But do you
use
 me thus Ned Must I marry your sister
 POINS God send the wench no worse fortune But I never said
so
 PRINCE Well thus we play the fools with the time and the
spirits
 of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us Is your master
here in
 London
 BARDOLPH Yea my lord
 PRINCE Where sups he Doth the old boar feed in the old frank
 BARDOLPH At the old place my lord in Eastcheap
 PRINCE What company
 PAGE Ephesians my lord of the old church
 PRINCE Sup any women with him
 PAGE None my lord but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll
 Tearsheet
 PRINCE What pagan may that be
 PAGE A proper gentlewoman sir and a kinswoman of my
masters
 PRINCE Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town
bull
 Shall we steal upon them Ned at supper
 POINS I am your shadow my lord Ill follow you
 PRINCE Sirrah you boy and Bardolph no word to your master
that
 I am yet come to town Theres for your silence
 BARDOLPH I have no tongue sir
 PAGE And for mine sir I will govern it
 PRINCE Fare you well go Exeunt BARDOLPH and PAGE
 This Doll Tearsheet should be some road
 POINS I warrant you as common as the way between Saint Albans
and
 London
 PRINCE How might we see Falstaff bestow himself tonight in
his
 true colours and not ourselves be seen
 POINS Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons and wait upon
him at
 his table as drawers
 PRINCE From a god to a bull A heavy descension It was Joves
 case From a prince to a prentice A low transformation That
 shall be mine for in everything the purpose must weigh with
the
 folly Follow me Ned
 Exeunt




SCENE III
Warkworth Before the castle

Enter NORTHUMBERLAND LADY NORTHUMBERLAND and LADY PERCY

 NORTHUMBERLAND I pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter
 Give even way unto my rough affairs
 Put not you on the visage of the times
 And be like them to Percy troublesome
 LADY NORTHUMBERLAND I have given over I will speak no more
 Do what you will your wisdom be your guide
 NORTHUMBERLAND Alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
 And but my going nothing can redeem it
 LADY PERCY O yet for Gods sake go not to these wars
 The time was father that you broke your word
 When you were more endeard to it than now
 When your own Percy when my hearts dear Harry
 Threw many a northward look to see his father
 Bring up his powers but he did long in vain
 Who then persuaded you to stay at home
 There were two honours lost yours and your sons
 For yours the God of heaven brighten it
 For his it stuck upon him as the sun
 In the grey vault of heaven and by his light
 Did all the chivalry of England move
 To do brave acts He was indeed the glass
 Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
 He had no legs that practisd not his gait
 And speaking thick which nature made his blemish
 Became the accents of the valiant
 For those who could speak low and tardily
 Would turn their own perfection to abuse
 To seem like him so that in speech in gait
 In diet in affections of delight
 In military rules humours of blood
 He was the mark and glass copy and book
 That fashiond others And him O wondrous him
 O miracle of men him did you leave
 Second to none unseconded by you
 To look upon the hideous god of war
 In disadvantage to abide a field
 Where nothing but the sound of Hotspurs name
 Did seem defensible So you left him
 Never O never do his ghost the wrong
 To hold your honour more precise and nice
 With others than with him Let them alone
 The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong
 Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers
 Today might I hanging on Hotspurs neck
 Have talkd of Monmouths grave
 NORTHUMBERLAND Beshrew your heart
 Fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me
 With new lamenting ancient oversights
 But I must go and meet with danger there
 Or it will seek me in another place
 And find me worse provided
 LADY NORTHUMBERLAND O fly to Scotland
 Till that the nobles and the armed commons
 Have of their puissance made a little taste
 LADY PERCY If they get ground and vantage of the King
 Then join you with them like a rib of steel
 To make strength stronger but for all our loves
 First let them try themselves So did your son
 He was so suffred so came I a widow
 And never shall have length of life enough
 To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
 That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
 For recordation to my noble husband
 NORTHUMBERLAND Come come go in with me Tis with my mind
 As with the tide swelld up unto his height
 That makes a stillstand running neither way
 Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop
 But many thousand reasons hold me back
 I will resolve for Scotland There am I
 Till time and vantage crave my company Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
Westminster The palace

Enter the KING in his nightgown with a page

 KING Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick
 But ere they come bid them oerread these letters
 And well consider of them Make good speed Exit page
 How many thousands of my poorest subjects
 Are at this hour asleep O sleep O gentle sleep
 Natures soft nurse how have I frightened thee
 That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down
 And steep my senses in forgetfulness
 Why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs
 Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
 And hushd with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber
 Than in the perfumd chambers of the great
 Under the canopies of costly state
 And lulld with sound of sweetest melody
 O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
 In loathsome beds and leavst the kingly couch
 A watchcase or a common larumbell
 Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
 Seal up the shipboys eyes and rock his brains
 In cradle of the rude imperious surge
 And in the visitation of the winds
 Who take the ruffian billows by the top
 Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
 With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds
 That with the hurly death itself awakes
 Canst thou O partial sleep give thy repose
 To the wet seaboy in an hour so rude
 And in the calmest and most stillest night
 With all appliances and means to boot
 Deny it to a king Then happy low lie down
 Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown

 Enter WARWICK and Surrey

 WARWICK Many good morrows to your Majesty
 KING Is it good morrow lords
 WARWICK Tis one oclock and past
 KING Why then good morrow to you all my lords
 Have you read oer the letters that I sent you
 WARWICK We have my liege
 KING Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
 How foul it is what rank diseases grow
 And with what danger near the heart of it
 WARWICK It is but as a body yet distempered
 Which to his former strength may be restored
 With good advice and little medicine
 My Lord Northumberland will soon be coold
 KING O God that one might read the book of fate
 And see the revolution of the times
 Make mountains level and the continent
 Weary of solid firmness melt itself
 Into the sea and other times to see
 The beachy girdle of the ocean
 Too wide for Neptunes hips how chances mock
 And changes fill the cup of alteration
 With divers liquors O if this were seen
 The happiest youth viewing his progress through
 What perils past what crosses to ensue
 Would shut the book and sit him down and die
 Tis not ten years gone
 Since Richard and Northumberland great friends
 Did feast together and in two years after
 Were they at wars It is but eight years since
 This Percy was the man nearest my soul
 Who like a brother toild in my affairs
 And laid his love and life under my foot
 Yea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard
 Gave him defiance But which of you was by
 To WARWICK You cousin Nevil as I may remember
 When Richard with his eye brim full of tears
 Then checkd and rated by Northumberland
 Did speak these words now provd a prophecy
 Northumberland thou ladder by the which
 My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne
 Though then God knows I had no such intent
 But that necessity so bowd the state
 That I and greatness were compelld to kiss
 The time shall come thus did he follow it
 The time will come that foul sin gathering head
 Shall break into corruption so went on
 Foretelling this same times condition
 And the division of our amity
 WARWICK There is a history in all mens lives
 Figuring the natures of the times deceasd
 The which observd a man may prophesy
 With a near aim of the main chance of things
 As yet not come to life who in their seeds
 And weak beginning lie intreasured
 Such things become the hatch and brood of time
 And by the necessary form of this
 King Richard might create a perfect guess
 That great Northumberland then false to him
 Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
 Which should not find a ground to root upon
 Unless on you
 KING Are these things then necessities
 Then let us meet them like necessities
 And that same word even now cries out on us
 They say the Bishop and Northumberland
 Are fifty thousand strong
 WARWICK It cannot be my lord
 Rumour doth double like the voice and echo
 The numbers of the feared Please it your Grace
 To go to bed Upon my soul my lord
 The powers that you already have sent forth
 Shall bring this prize in very easily
 To comfort you the more I have receivd
 A certain instance that Glendower is dead
 Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill
 And these unseasoned hours perforce must ad
 Unto your sickness
 KING I will take your counsel
 And were these inward wars once out of hand
 We would dear lords unto the Holy Land Exeunt

radish
 with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife A was
so
 forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were

ACT IV SCENE I
Yorkshire Within the Forest of Gaultree

Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK MOWBRAY HASTINGS and others

 ARCHBISHOP What is this forest calld
 HASTINGS Tis Gaultree Forest ant shall please your Grace
 ARCHBISHOP Here stand my lords and send discoverers forth
 To know the numbers of our enemies
 HASTINGS We have sent forth already
 ARCHBISHOP Tis well done
 My friends and brethren in these great affairs
 I must acquaint you that I have receivd
 Newdated letters from Northumberland
 Their cold intent tenour and substance thus
 Here doth he wish his person with such powers
 As might hold sortance with his quality
 The which he could not levy whereupon
 He is retird to ripe his growing fortunes
 To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
 That your attempts may overlive the hazard
 And fearful meeting of their opposite
 MOWBRAY Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
 And dash themselves to pieces

 Enter A MESSENGER

 HASTINGS Now what news
 MESSENGER West of this forest scarcely off a mile
 In goodly form comes on the enemy
 And by the ground they hide I judge their number
 Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand
 MOWBRAY The just proportion that we gave them out
 Let us sway on and face them in the field

 Enter WESTMORELAND

 ARCHBISHOP What wellappointed leader fronts us here
 MOWBRAY I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland
 WESTMORELAND Health and fair greeting from our general
 The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster
 ARCHBISHOP Say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace
 What doth concern your coming
 WESTMORELAND Then my lord
 Unto your Grace do I in chief address
 The substance of my speech If that rebellion
 Came like itself in base and abject routs
 Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
 And countenancd by boys and beggary
 I say if damnd commotion so appeard
 In his true native and most proper shape
 You reverend father and these noble lords
 Had not been here to dress the ugly form
 Of base and bloody insurrection
 With your fair honours You Lord Archbishop
 Whose see is by a civil peace maintaind
 Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touchd
 Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutord
 Whose white investments figure innocence
 The dove and very blessed spirit of peace
 Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself
 Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
 Into the harsh and boistrous tongue of war
 Turning your books to graves your ink to blood
 Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
 To a loud trumpet and a point of war
 ARCHBISHOP Wherefore do I this So the question stands
 Briefly to this end we are all diseasd
 And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
 Have brought ourselves into a burning fever
 And we must bleed for it of which disease
 Our late King Richard being infected died
 But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland
 I take not on me here as a physician
 Nor do I as an enemy to peace
 Troop in the throngs of military men
 But rather show awhile like fearful war
 To diet rank minds sick of happiness
 And purge th obstructions which begin to stop
 Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly
 I have in equal balance justly weighd
 What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
 And find our griefs heavier than our offences
 We see which way the stream of time doth run
 And are enforcd from our most quiet there
 By the rough torrent of occasion
 And have the summary of all our griefs
 When time shall serve to show in articles
 Which long ere this we offerd to the King
 And might by no suit gain our audience
 When we are wrongd and would unfold our griefs
 We are denied access unto his person
 Even by those men that most have done us wrong
 The dangers of the days but newly gone
 Whose memory is written on the earth
 With yet appearing blood and the examples
 Of every minutes instance present now
 Hath put us in these illbeseeming arms
 Not to break peace or any branch of it
 But to establish here a peace indeed
 Concurring both in name and quality
 WESTMORELAND When ever yet was your appeal denied
 Wherein have you been galled by the King
 What peer hath been subornd to grate on you
 That you should seal this lawless bloody book
 Of forgd rebellion with a seal divine
 And consecrate commotions bitter edge
 ARCHBISHOP My brother general the commonwealth
 To brother horn an household cruelty
 I make my quarrel in particular
 WESTMORELAND There is no need of any such redress
 Or if there were it not belongs to you
 MOWBRAY Why not to him in part and to us all
 That feel the bruises of the days before
 And suffer the condition of these times
 To lay a heavy and unequal hand
 Upon our honours
 WESTMORELAND O my good Lord Mowbray
 Construe the times to their necessities
 And you shall say indeed it is the time
 And not the King that doth you injuries
 Yet for your part it not appears to me
 Either from the King or in the present time
 That you should have an inch of any ground
 To build a grief on Were you not restord
 To all the Duke of Norfolks signiories
 Your noble and right wellremembred fathers
 MOWBRAY What thing in honour had my father lost
 That need to be revivd and breathd in me
 The King that lovd him as the state stood then
 Was force perforce compelld to banish him
 And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he
 Being mounted and both roused in their seats
 Their neighing coursers daring of the spur
 Their armed staves in charge their beavers down
 Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel
 And the loud trumpet blowing them together
 Then then when there was nothing could have stayd
 My father from the breast of Bolingbroke
 O when the King did throw his warder down
 His own life hung upon the staff he threw
 Then threw he down himself and all their lives
 That by indictment and by dint of sword
 Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke
 WESTMORELAND You speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what
 The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
 In England the most valiant gentleman
 Who knows on whom fortune would then have smild
 But if your father had been victor there
 He neer had borne it out of Coventry
 For all the country in a general voice
 Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
 Were set on Hereford whom they doted on
 And blessd and gracd indeed more than the King
 But this is mere digression from my purpose
 Here come I from our princely general
 To know your griefs to tell you from his Grace
 That he will give you audience and wherein
 It shall appear that your demands are just
 You shall enjoy them everything set off
 That might so much as think you enemies
 MOWBRAY But he hath forcd us to compel this offer
 And it proceeds from policy not love
 WESTMORELAND Mowbray you overween to take it so
 This offer comes from mercy not from fear
 For lo within a ken our army lies
 Upon mine honour all too confident
 To give admittance to a thought of fear
 Our battle is more full of names than yours
 Our men more perfect in the use of arms
 Our armour all as strong our cause the best
 Then reason will our hearts should be as good
 Say you not then our offer is compelld
 MOWBRAY Well by my will we shall admit no parley
 WESTMORELAND That argues but the shame of your offence
 A rotten case abides no handling
 HASTINGS Hath the Prince John a full commission
 In very ample virtue of his father
 To hear and absolutely to determine
 Of what conditions we shall stand upon
 WESTMORELAND That is intended in the generals name
 I muse you make so slight a question
 ARCHBISHOP Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule
 For this contains our general grievances
 Each several article herein redressd
 All members of our cause both here and hence
 That are insinewed to this action
 Acquitted by a true substantial form
 And present execution of our wills
 To us and to our purposes confind
 We come within our awful banks again
 And knit our powers to the arm of peace
 WESTMORELAND This will I show the general Please you lords
 In sight of both our battles we may meet
 And either end in peace which God so frame
 Or to the place of diffrence call the swords
 Which must decide it
 ARCHBISHOP My lord we will do so Exit WESTMORELAND
 MOWBRAY There is a thing within my bosom tells me
 That no conditions of our peace can stand
 HASTINGS Fear you not that if we can make our peace
 Upon such large terms and so absolute
 As our conditions shall consist upon
 Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
 MOWBRAY Yea but our valuation shall be such
 That every slight and falsederived cause
 Yea every idle nice and wanton reason
 Shall to the King taste of this action
 That were our royal faiths martyrs in love
 We shall be winnowd with so rough a wind
 That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
 And good from bad find no partition
 ARCHBISHOP No no my lord Note this the King is weary
 Of dainty and such picking grievances
 For he hath found to end one doubt by death
 Revives two greater in the heirs of life
 And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
 And keep no telltale to his memory
 That may repeat and history his los
 To new remembrance For full well he knows
 He cannot so precisely weed this land
 As his misdoubts present occasion
 His foes are so enrooted with his friends
 That plucking to unfix an enemy
 He doth unfasten so and shake a friend
 So that this land like an offensive wife
 That hath enragd him on to offer strokes
 As he is striking holds his infant up
 And hangs resolvd correction in the arm
 That was upreard to execution
 HASTINGS Besides the King hath wasted all his rods
 On late offenders that he now doth lack
 The very instruments of chastisement
 So that his power like to a fangless lion
 May offer but not hold
 ARCHBISHOP Tis very true
 And therefore be assurd my good Lord Marshal
 If we do now make our atonement well
 Our peace will like a broken limb united
 Grow stronger for the breaking
 MOWBRAY Be it so
 Here is returnd my Lord of Westmoreland

 Reenter WESTMORELAND

 WESTMORELAND The Prince is here at hand Pleaseth your
lordship
 To meet his Grace just distance tween our armies
 MOWBRAY Your Grace of York in Gods name then set forward
 ARCHBISHOP Before and greet his Grace My lord we come
 Exeunt




SCENE II
Another part of the forest

Enter from one side MOWBRAY attended afterwards the
ARCHBISHOP
HASTINGS and others from the other side PRINCE JOHN of
LANCASTER
WESTMORELAND OFFICERS and others

 PRINCE JOHN You are well encountred here my cousin Mowbray
 Good day to you gentle Lord Archbishop
 And so to you Lord Hastings and to all
 My Lord of York it better showd with you
 When that your flock assembled by the bell
 Encircled you to hear with reverence
 Your exposition on the holy text
 Than now to see you here an iron man
 Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum
 Turning the word to sword and life to death
 That man that sits within a monarchs heart
 And ripens in the sunshine of his favour
 Would he abuse the countenance of the king
 Alack what mischiefs might he set abroach
 In shadow of such greatness With you Lord Bishop
 It is even so Who hath not heard it spoken
 How deep you were within the books of God
 To us the speaker in His parliament
 To us th imagind voice of God himself
 The very opener and intelligencer
 Between the grace the sanctities of heaven
 And our dull workings O who shall believe
 But you misuse the reverence of your place
 Employ the countenance and grace of heavn
 As a false favourite doth his princes name
 In deeds dishonourable You have taen up
 Under the counterfeited zeal of God
 The subjects of His substitute my father
 And both against the peace of heaven and him
 Have here upswarmd them
 ARCHBISHOP Good my Lord of Lancaster
 I am not here against your fathers peace
 But as I told my Lord of Westmoreland
 The time misordred doth in common sense
 Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
 To hold our safety up I sent your Grace
 The parcels and particulars of our grief
 The which hath been with scorn shovd from the court
 Whereon this hydra son of war is born
 Whose dangerous eyes may well be charmd asleep
 With grant of our most just and right desires
 And true obedience of this madness curd
 Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty
 MOWBRAY If not we ready are to try our fortunes
 To the last man
 HASTINGS And though we here fall down
 We have supplies to second our attempt
 If they miscarry theirs shall second them
 And so success of mischief shall be born
 And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
 Whiles England shall have generation
 PRINCE JOHN YOU are too shallow Hastings much to shallow
 To sound the bottom of the aftertimes
 WESTMORELAND Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly
 How far forth you do like their articles
 PRINCE JOHN I like them all and do allow them well
 And swear here by the honour of my blood
 My fathers purposes have been mistook
 And some about him have too lavishly
 Wrested his meaning and authority
 My lord these griefs shall be with speed redressd
 Upon my soul they shall If this may please you
 Discharge your powers unto their several counties
 As we will ours and here between the armies
 Lets drink together friendly and embrace
 That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
 Of our restored love and amity
 ARCHBISHOP I take your princely word for these redresses
 PRINCE JOHN I give it you and will maintain my word
 And thereupon I drink unto your Grace
 HASTINGS Go Captain and deliver to the army
 This news of peace Let them have pay and part
 I know it will please them Hie thee Captain
 Exit Officer
 ARCHBISHOP To you my noble Lord of Westmoreland
 WESTMORELAND I pledge your Grace and if you knew what pains
 I have bestowd to breed this present peace
 You would drink freely but my love to ye
 Shall show itself more openly hereafter
 ARCHBISHOP I do not doubt you
 WESTMORELAND I am glad of it
 Health to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray
 MOWBRAY You wish me health in very happy season
 For I am on the sudden something ill
 ARCHBISHOP Against ill chances men are ever merry
 But heaviness foreruns the good event
 WESTMORELAND Therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow
 Serves to say thus Some good thing comes tomorrow
 ARCHBISHOP Believe me I am passing light in spirit
 MOWBRAY So much the worse if your own rule be true
 Shouts within
 PRINCE JOHN The word of peace is rendred Hark how they
shout
 MOWBRAY This had been cheerful after victory
 ARCHBISHOP A peace is of the nature of a conquest
 For then both parties nobly are subdud
 And neither party loser
 PRINCE JOHN Go my lord
 And let our army be discharged too
 Exit WESTMORELAND
 And good my lord so please you let our trains
 March by us that we may peruse the men
 We should have copd withal
 ARCHBISHOP Go good Lord Hastings
 And ere they be dismissd let them march by
 Exit HASTINGS
 PRINCE JOHN I trust lords we shall lie tonight together

 Reenter WESTMORELAND

 Now cousin wherefore stands our army still
 WESTMORELAND The leaders having charge from you to stand
 Will not go off until they hear you speak
 PRINCE JOHN They know their duties

 Reenter HASTINGS

 HASTINGS My lord our army is dispersd already
 Like youthful steers unyokd they take their courses
 East west north south or like a school broke up
 Each hurries toward his home and sportingplace
 WESTMORELAND Good tidings my Lord Hastings for the which
 I do arrest thee traitor of high treason
 And you Lord Archbishop and you Lord Mowbray
 Of capital treason I attach you both
 MOWBRAY Is this proceeding just and honourable
 WESTMORELAND Is your assembly so
 ARCHBISHOP Will you thus break your faith
 PRINCE JOHN I pawnd thee none
 I promisd you redress of these same grievances
 Whereof you did complain which by mine honour
 I will perform with a most Christian care
 But for you rebels look to taste the due
 Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours
 Most shallowly did you these arms commence
 Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence
 Strike up our drums pursue the scattred stray
 God and not we hath safely fought today
 Some guard these traitors to the block of death
 Treasons true bed and yielderup of breath Exeunt

 think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet Have I in my poor
and
 old motion the expedition of thought I have speeded hither
with
 the very extremest inch of possibility I have foundred nine
 score and odd posts and here travel tainted as I am have
in
 my pure and immaculate valour taken Sir John Colville of the
 Dalea most furious knight and valorous enemy But what of
that
 He saw me and yielded that I may justly say with the
hooknosd
 fellow of RomeI came saw and overcame
 PRINCE JOHN It was more of his courtesy than your deserving
 FALSTAFF I know not Here he is and here I yield him and I
 beseech your Grace let it be bookd with the rest of this

 Gloucestershire and when you come to court stand my good
lord
 pray in your good report
 PRINCE JOHN Fare you well Falstaff I in my condition
 Shall better speak of you than you deserve
 Exeunt all but FALSTAFF
 FALSTAFF I would you had but the wit twere better than your
 dukedom Good faith this same young soberblooded boy doth
not
 love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but thats no
marvel
 he drinks no wine Theres never none of these demure boys
come
 to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood
and
 making many fishmeals that they fall into a kind of male
 greensickness and then when they marry they get wenches
They
 are generally fools and cowardswhich some of us should be
too
 but for inflammation A good sherrissack hath a twofold
 operation in it It ascends me into the brain dries me there
all
 the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it
makes it
 apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and
 delectable shapes which delivered oer to the voice the
tongue
 which is the birth becomes excellent wit The second
property of
 your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which
before
 cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the
 badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms
it
 and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes
It
 illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all
the
 rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital
 commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their
 captain the heart who great and puffd up with this
retinue
 doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris
So
 that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that
sets
 it awork and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil
 till sack commences it and sets it in act and use Hereof
comes
 it that Prince Harry is valiant for the cold blood he did
 naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile
and
 bare land manured husbanded and tilld with excellent
 endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris
 that he is become very hot and valiant If I had a thousand
sons
 the first humane principle I would teach them should be to
 forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack

 Enter BARDOLPH

 How now Bardolph
 BARDOLPH The army is discharged all and gone
 FALSTAFF Let them go Ill through Gloucestershire and there
will
 I visit Master Robert Shallow Esquire I have him already
 tempring between my finger and my thumb and shortly will I
seal
 with him Come away Exeunt

Enter the KING PRINCE THOMAS OF CLARENCE PRINCE HUMPHREY OF
GLOUCESTER
WARWICK and others

 KING Now lords if God doth give successful end
 To this debate that bleedeth at our doors
 We will our youth lead on to higher fields
 And draw no swords but what are sanctified
 Our navy is addressd our power connected
 Our substitutes in absence well invested
 And everything lies level to our wish
 Only we want a little personal strength
 And pause us till these rebels now afoot
 Come underneath the yoke of government
 WARWICK Both which we doubt not but your Majesty
 Shall soon enjoy
 KING Humphrey my son of Gloucester
 Where is the Prince your brother
 PRINCE HUMPHREY I think hes gone to hunt my lord at
Windsor
 KING And how accompanied
 PRINCE HUMPHREY I do not know my lord
 KING Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him
 PRINCE HUMPHREY No my good lord he is in presence here
 CLARENCE What would my lord and father
 KING Nothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence
 How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother
 He loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas
 Thou hast a better place in his affection
 Than all thy brothers cherish it my boy
 And noble offices thou mayst effect
 Of mediation after I am dead
 Between his greatness and thy other brethren
 Therefore omit him not blunt not his love
 Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
 By seeming cold or careless of his will
 For he is gracious if he be observd
 He hath a tear for pity and a hand
 Open as day for melting charity
 Yet notwithstanding being incensd he is flint
 As humorous as winter and as sudden
 As flaws congealed in the spring of day
 His temper therefore must be well observd
 Chide him for faults and do it reverently
 When you perceive his blood inclind to mirth
 But being moody give him line and scope
 Till that his passions like a whale on ground
 Confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas
 And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
 A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
 That the united vessel of their blood
 Mingled with venom of suggestion
 As force perforce the age will pour it in
 Shall never leak though it do work as strong
 As aconitum or rash gunpowder
 CLARENCE I shall observe him with all care and love
 KING Why art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas
 CLARENCE He is not there today he dines in London
 KING And how accompanied Canst thou tell that
 CLARENCE With Poins and other his continual followers
 KING Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
 And he the noble image of my youth
 Is overspread with them therefore my grief
 Stretches itself beyond the hour of death
 The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
 In forms imaginary thunguided days
 And rotten times that you shall look upon
 When I am sleeping with my ancestors
 For when his headstrong riot hath no curb
 When rage and hot blood are his counsellors
 When means and lavish manners meet together
 O with what wings shall his affections fly
 Towards fronting peril and opposd decay
 WARWICK My gracious lord you look beyond him quite
 The Prince but studies his companions
 Like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
 Tis needful that the most immodest word
 Be lookd upon and learnt which once attaind
 Your Highness knows comes to no further use
 But to be known and hated So like gross terms
 The Prince will in the perfectness of time
 Cast off his followers and their memory
 Shall as a pattern or a measure live
 By which his Grace must mete the lives of other
 Turning past evils to advantages
 KING Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
 In the dead carrion

 Enter WESTMORELAND

 Whos here Westmoreland
 WESTMORELAND Health to my sovereign and new happiness
 Added to that that am to deliver
 Prince John your son doth kiss your Graces hand
 Mowbray the Bishop Scroop Hastings and all
 Are brought to the correction of your law
 There is not now a rebels sword unsheathd
 But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere
 The manner how this action hath been borne
 Here at more leisure may your Highness read
 With every course in his particular
 KING O Westmoreland thou art a summer bird
 Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
 The lifting up of day

 Enter HARCOURT

 Look heres more news
 HARCOURT From enemies heaven keep your Majesty
 And when they stand against you may they fall
 As those that I am come to tell you of
 The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph
 With a great power of English and of Scots
 Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown
 The manner and true order of the fight
 This packet please it you contains at large
 KING And wherefore should these good news make me sick
 Will Fortune never come with both hands full
 But write her fair words still in foulest letters
 She either gives a stomach and no food
 Such are the poor in health or else a feast
 And takes away the stomach such are the rich
 That have abundance and enjoy it not
 I should rejoice now at this happy news
 And now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
 O me come near me now I am much ill
 PRINCE HUMPHREY Comfort your Majesty
 CLARENCE O my royal father
 WESTMORELAND My sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up
 WARWICK Be patient Princes you do know these fits
 Are with his Highness very ordinary
 Stand from him give him air hell straight be well
 CLARENCE No no he cannot long hold out these pangs
 Th incessant care and labour of his mind
 Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
 So thin that life looks through and will break out
 PRINCE HUMPHREY The people fear me for they do observe
 Unfatherd heirs and loathly births of nature
 The seasons change their manners as the year
 Had found some months asleep and leapt them over
 CLARENCE The river hath thrice flowd no ebb between
 And the old folk Times doting chronicles
 Say it did so a little time before
 That our great grandsire Edward sickd and died
 WARWICK Speak lower Princes for the King recovers
 PRINCE HUMPHREY This apoplexy will certain be his end
 KING I pray you take me up and bear me hence

 WARWICK Not so much noise my lords Sweet Prince speak low
 The King your father is disposd to sleep
 CLARENCE Let us withdraw into the other room
 WARWICK Willt please your Grace to go along with us
 PRINCE No I will sit and watch here by the King
 Exeunt all but the PRINCE
 Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
 Being so troublesome a bedfellow
 O polishd perturbation golden care
 That keepst the ports of slumber open wide
 To many a watchful night Sleep with it now
 Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
 As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
 Snores out the watch of night O majesty
 When thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit
 Like a rich armour worn in heat of day
 That scaldst with safety By his gates of breath
 There lies a downy feather which stirs not
 Did he suspire that light and weightless down
 Perforce must move My gracious lord my father
 This sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep
 That from this golden rigol hath divorcd
 So many English kings Thy due from me
 Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
 Which nature love and filial tenderness
 Shall O dear father pay thee plenteously
 My due from thee is this imperial crown
 Which as immediate from thy place and blood
 Derives itself to me Putting on the crown Lo where it
sits
 Which God shall guard and put the worlds whole strength
 Into one giant arm it shall not force
 This lineal honour from me This from thee
 Will I to mine leave as tis left to me Exit

 KING Why did you leave me here alone my lords
 CLARENCE We left the Prince my brother here my liege
 Who undertook to sit and watch by you
 KING The Prince of Wales Where is he Let me see him
 He is not here
 WARWICK This door is open he is gone this way
 PRINCE HUMPHREY He came not through the chamber where we
stayd
 KING Where is the crown Who took it from my pillow
 WARWICK When we withdrew my liege we left it here
 KING The Prince hath taen it hence Go seek him out
 Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
 My sleep my death
 Find him my lord of Warwick chide him hither
 Exit WARWICK
 This part of his conjoins with my disease
 And helps to end me See sons what things you are
 How quickly nature falls into revolt
 When gold becomes her object
 For this the foolish overcareful fathers
 Have broke their sleep with thoughts
 Their brains with care their bones with industry
 For this they have engrossed and pild up
 The cankred heaps of strangeachieved gold
 For this they have been thoughtful to invest
 Their sons with arts and martial exercises
 When like the bee tolling from every flower
 The virtuous sweets
 Our thighs with wax our mouths with honey packd
 We bring it to the hive and like the bees
 Are murdred for our pains This bitter taste
 Yields his engrossments to the ending father

 Reenter WARWICK

 Now where is he that will not stay so long
 Till his friend sickness hath determind me
 WARWICK My lord I found the Prince in the next room
 Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks
 With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow
 That tyranny which never quaffd but blood
 Would by beholding him have washd his knife
 With gentle eyedrops He is coming hither
 KING But wherefore did he take away the crown

 Reenter PRINCE HENRY

 Lo where he comes Come hither to me Harry
 Depart the chamber leave us here alone
 Exeunt all but the KING and the PRINCE
 PRINCE I never thought to hear you speak again
 KING Thy wish was father Harry to that thought
 I stay too long by thee I weary thee
 Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
 That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
 Before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth
 Thou seekst the greatness that will overwhelm thee
 Stay but a little for my cloud of dignity
 Is held from falling with so weak a wind
 That it will quickly drop my day is dim
 Thou hast stoln that which after some few hours
 Were thine without offense and at my death
 Thou hast seald up my expectation
 Thy life did manifest thou lovdst me not
 And thou wilt have me die assurd of it
 Thou hidst a thousand daggers in thy thoughts
 Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
 To stab at half an hour of my life
 What canst thou not forbear me half an hour
 Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
 And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
 That thou art crowned not that I am dead
 Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
 Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head
 Only compound me with forgotten dust
 Give that which gave thee life unto the worms
 Pluck down my officers break my decrees
 For now a time is come to mock at form
 Harry the Fifth is crownd Up vanity
 Down royal state All you sage counsellors hence
 And to the English court assemble now
 From every region apes of idleness
 Now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
 Have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
 Revel the night rob murder and commit
 The oldest sins the newest kind of ways
 Be happy he will trouble you no more
 England shall double gild his treble guilt
 England shall give him office honour might
 For the fifth Harry from curbd license plucks
 The muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
 Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent
 O my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
 When that my care could not withhold thy riots
 What wilt thou do when riot is thy care
 O thou wilt be a wilderness again
 Peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants
 PRINCE O pardon me my liege But for my tears
 The moist impediments unto my speech
 I had forestalld this dear and deep rebuke
 Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
 The course of it so far There is your crown
 And he that wears the crown immortally
 Long guard it yours Kneeling If I affect it more
 Than as your honour and as your renown
 Let me no more from this obedience rise
 Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
 Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
 God witness with me when I here came in
 And found no course of breath within your Majesty
 How cold it struck my heart If I do feign
 O let me in my present wildness die
 And never live to show th incredulous world
 The noble change that I have purposed
 Coming to look on you thinking you dead
 And dead almost my liege to think you were
 I spake unto this crown as having sense
 And thus upbraided it The care on thee depending
 Hath fed upon the body of my father
 Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
 Other less fine in carat is more precious
 Preserving life in medcine potable
 But thou most fine most honourd most renownd
 Hast eat thy bearer up Thus my most royal liege
 Accusing it I put it on my head
 To try with it as with an enemy
 That had before my face murdred my father
 The quarrel of a true inheritor
 But if it did infect my blood with joy
 Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
 If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
 Did with the least affection of a welcome
 Give entertainment to the might of it
 Let God for ever keep it from my head
 And make me as the poorest vassal is
 That doth with awe and terror kneel to it
 KING O my son
 God put it in thy mind to take it hence
 That thou mightst win the more thy fathers love
 Pleading so wisely in excuse of it
 Come hither Harry sit thou by my bed
 And hear I think the very latest counsel
 That ever I shall breathe God knows my son
 By what bypaths and indirect crookd ways
 I met this crown and I myself know well
 How troublesome it sat upon my head
 To thee it shall descend with better quiet
 Better opinion better confirmation
 For all the soil of the achievement goes
 With me into the earth It seemd in me
 But as an honour snatchd with boistrous hand
 And I had many living to upbraid
 My gain of it by their assistances
 Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
 Wounding supposed peace All these bold fears
 Thou seest with peril I have answered
 For all my reign hath been but as a scene
 Acting that argument And now my death
 Changes the mood for what in me was purchasd
 Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
 So thou the garland wearst successively
 Yet though thou standst more sure than I could do
 Thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
 And all my friends which thou must make thy friends
 Have but their stings and teeth newly taen out
 By whose fell working I was first advancd
 And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
 To be again displacd which to avoid
 I cut them off and had a purpose now
 To lead out many to the Holy Land
 Lest rest and lying still might make them look
 Too near unto my state Therefore my Harry
 Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
 With foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
 May waste the memory of the former days
 More would I but my lungs are wasted so
 That strength of speech is utterly denied me
 How I came by the crown O God forgive
 And grant it may with thee in true peace live
 PRINCE My gracious liege
 You won it wore it kept it gave it me
 Then plain and right must my possession be
 Which I with more than with a common pain
 Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain

 Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER WARWICK LORDS and others

 KING Look look here comes my John of Lancaster
 PRINCE JOHN Health peace and happiness to my royal father
 KING Thou bringst me happiness and peace son John
 But health alack with youthful wings is flown
 From this bare witherd trunk Upon thy sight
 My worldly business makes a period
 Where is my Lord of Warwick
 PRINCE My Lord of Warwick
 KING Doth any name particular belong
 Unto the lodging where I first did swoon
 WARWICK Tis calld Jerusalem my noble lord
 KING Laud be to God Even there my life must end
 It hath been prophesied to me many years
 I should not die but in Jerusalem
 Which vainly I supposd the Holy Land
 But bear me to that chamber there Ill lie
 In that Jerusalem shall Harry die Exeunt

 DAVY I beseech you sir to countenance William Visor of

That
 Visor is an arrant knave on my knowledge

BARDOLPH
 and PAGE If I were sawed into quantities I should make
four
 dozen of such bearded hermits staves as Master Shallow It
is a
 wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his mens
 spirits and his They by observing of him do bear
themselves
 like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned
 into a justicelike servingman Their spirits are so married
in
 conjunction with the participation of society that they flock
 together in consent like so many wild geese If I had a suit
to
 Master Shallow I would humour his men with the imputation of
 being near their master if to his men I would curry with
Master
 Shallow that no man could better command his servants It is
 certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
caught
 as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take
heed
 of their company I will devise matter enough out of this
Shallow
 to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of
six
 fashions which is four terms or two actions and a shall
laugh
 without intervallums O it is much that a lie with a slight
 oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that
never
 had the ache in his shoulders O you shall see him laugh
till
 his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up
 SHALLOW Within Sir John
 FALSTAFF I come Master Shallow I come Master Shallow

SCENE II
Westminster The palace

Enter severally WARWICK and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE

 WARWICK How now my Lord Chief Justice whither away
 CHIEF JUSTICE How doth the King
 WARWICK Exceeding well his cares are now all ended
 CHIEF JUSTICE I hope not dead
 WARWICK Hes walkd the way of nature
 And to our purposes he lives no more
 CHIEF JUSTICE I would his Majesty had calld me with him
 The service that I truly did his life
 Hath left me open to all injuries
 WARWICK Indeed I think the young king loves you not
 CHIEF JUSTICE I know he doth not and do arm myself
 To welcome the condition of the time
 Which cannot look more hideously upon me
 Than I have drawn it in my fantasy

 Enter LANCASTER CLARENCE GLOUCESTER
 WESTMORELAND and others

 WARWICK Here comes the heavy issue of dead Harry
 O that the living Harry had the temper
 Of he the worst of these three gentlemen
 How many nobles then should hold their places
 That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort
 CHIEF JUSTICE O God I fear all will be overturnd
 PRINCE JOHN Good morrow cousin Warwick good morrow
 GLOUCESTER  CLARENCE Good morrow cousin
 PRINCE JOHN We meet like men that had forgot to speak
 WARWICK We do remember but our argument
 Is all too heavy to admit much talk
 PRINCE JOHN Well peace be with him that hath made us heavy
 CHIEF JUSTICE Peace be with us lest we be heavier
 PRINCE HUMPHREY O good my lord you have lost a friend
indeed
 And I dare swear you borrow not that face
 Of seeming sorrow it is sure your own
 PRINCE JOHN Though no man be assurd what grace to find
 You stand in coldest expectation
 I am the sorrier would twere otherwise
 CLARENCE Well you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair
 Which swims against your stream of quality
 CHIEF JUSTICE Sweet Princes what I did I did in honour
 Led by th impartial conduct of my soul
 And never shall you see that I will beg
 A ragged and forestalld remission
 If truth and upright innocency fail me
 Ill to the King my master that is dead
 And tell him who hath sent me after him
 WARWICK Here comes the Prince

 Enter KING HENRY THE FIFTH attended

 CHIEF JUSTICE Good morrow and God save your Majesty
 KING This new and gorgeous garment majesty
 Sits not so easy on me as you think
 Brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
 This is the English not the Turkish court
 Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds
 But Harry Harry Yet be sad good brothers
 For by my faith it very well becomes you
 Sorrow so royally in you appears
 That I will deeply put the fashion on
 And wear it in my heart Why then be sad
 But entertain no more of it good brothers
 Than a joint burden laid upon us all
 For me by heaven I bid you be assurd
 Ill be your father and your brother too
 Let me but bear your love Ill bear your cares
 Yet weep that Harrys dead and so will I
 But Harry lives that shall convert those tears
 By number into hours of happiness
 BROTHERS We hope no otherwise from your Majesty
 KING You all look strangely on me and you most
 You are I think assurd I love you not
 CHIEF JUSTICE I am assurd if I be measurd rightly
 Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me
 KING No
 How might a prince of my great hopes forget
 So great indignities you laid upon me
 What rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
 Th immediate heir of England Was this easy
 May this be washd in Lethe and forgotten
 CHIEF JUSTICE I then did use the person of your father
 The image of his power lay then in me
 And in th administration of his law
 Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth
 Your Highness pleased to forget my place
 The majesty and power of law and justice
 The image of the King whom I presented
 And struck me in my very seat of judgment
 Whereon as an offender to your father
 I gave bold way to my authority
 And did commit you If the deed were ill
 Be you contented wearing now the garland
 To have a son set your decrees at nought
 To pluck down justice from your awful bench
 To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
 That guards the peace and safety of your person
 Nay more to spurn at your most royal image
 And mock your workings in a second body
 Question your royal thoughts make the case yours
 Be now the father and propose a son
 Hear your own dignity so much profand
 See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
 Behold yourself so by a son disdaind
 And then imagine me taking your part
 And in your power soft silencing your son
 After this cold considerance sentence me
 And as you are a king speak in your state
 What I have done that misbecame my place
 My person or my lieges sovereignty
 KING You are right Justice and you weigh this well
 Therefore still bear the balance and the sword
 And I do wish your honours may increase
 Till you do live to see a son of mine
 Offend you and obey you as I did
 So shall I live to speak my fathers words
 Happy am I that have a man so bold
 That dares do justice on my proper son
 And not less happy having such a son
 That would deliver up his greatness so
 Into the hands of justice You did commit me
 For which I do commit into your hand
 Th unstained sword that you have usd to bear
 With this remembrance that you use the same
 With the like bold just and impartial spirit
 As you have done gainst me There is my hand
 You shall be as a father to my youth
 My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear
 And I will stoop and humble my intents
 To your wellpractisd wise directions
 And Princes all believe me I beseech you
 My father is gone wild into his grave
 For in his tomb lie my affections
 And with his spirits sadly I survive
 To mock the expectation of the world
 To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
 Rotten opinion who hath writ me down
 After my seeming The tide of blood in me
 Hath proudly flowd in vanity till now
 Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
 Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
 And flow henceforth in formal majesty
 Now call we our high court of parliament
 And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
 That the great body of our state may go
 In equal rank with the best governd nation
 That war or peace or both at once may be
 As things acquainted and familiar to us
 In which you father shall have foremost hand
 Our coronation done we will accite
 As I before remembred all our state
 And God consigning to my good intents
 No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say
 God shorten Harrys happy life one day Exeunt

 Approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast
 The tutor and the feeder of my riots
 Till then I banish thee on pain of death
 As I have done the rest of my misleaders
 Not to come near our person by ten mile
 For competence of life I will allow you

displeasure my curtsy my duty and my speech to beg your

to say
is of mine own making and what indeed I should say will I
doubt
prove mine own marring But to the purpose and so to the
venture
Be it known to you as it is very well I was lately here in the
end
of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to
promise you
a better I meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an
ill venture it come unluckily home I break and you my gentle
creditors lose Here I promisd you I would be and here I
commit
my body to your mercies Bate me some and I will pay you some
and
as most debtors do promise you infinitely and so I kneel down
before
you but indeed to pray for the Queen
 If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command
me to
use my legs And yet that were but light paymentto dance out of
your debt But a good conscience will make any possible
satisfaction and so would I All the gentlewomen here have
forgiven
me If the gentlemen will not then the gentlemen do not agree
with
the gentlewomen which was never seen before in such an assembly
 One word more I beseech you If you be not too much cloyd
with fat
meat our humble author will continue the story with Sir John in
it and make you merry with fair Katherine of France where for
anything I know Falstaff shall die of a sweat unless already a
be
killed with your hard opinions for Oldcastle died a martyr and
this
is not the man My tongue is weary when my legs are too I will
bid
you good night
