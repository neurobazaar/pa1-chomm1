My Lords

As Debts of Gratitude ought most punctually to be paid so where the Debtor
is uncapable of Payment Acknowledgments ought at least to be made
I cannot in the least pretend to retaliate Your Lordships Favours to me
but must farther intrude on that Goodness of which I have already had
so good Experience by laying these Sheets at Your Lordships Feet
where they beg Protection as having nothing to recommend them but Truth
a Gift which every Author may be Master of if he will

I here present Your Lordships with a Description of your own Country
for the most part in her Natural Dress and therefore less vitiated
with Fraud and Luxury A Country whose Inhabitants may enjoy
a Life of the greatest Ease and Satisfaction and pass away their Hours
in solid Contentment

Those Charms of Liberty and Right the Darlings of an English Nature
which Your Lordships grant and maintain make you appear Noble Patrons
in the Eyes of all Men and we a happy People in a Foreign Country
which nothing less than Ingratitude and Baseness can make us disown

As Heaven has been liberal in its Gifts so are Your Lordships
favourable Promoters of whatever may make us an easy People
which I hope Your Lordships will continue to us and our Posterity
and that we and they may always acknowledge such Favours
by banishing from among us every Principle which renders Men
factious and unjust which is the hearty Prayer of

 My Lords
 Your Lordships most obliged
 most humble
 and most devoted Servant

PREFACE



Tis a great Misfortune that most of our Travellers who go to
this vast Continent in America are Persons of the meaner Sort
and generally of a very slender Education who being hird by the Merchants
to trade amongst the Indians in which Voyages they often spend
several Years are yet at their Return uncapable of giving
any reasonable Account of what they met withal in those remote Parts
tho the Country abounds with Curiosities worthy a nice Observation
In this Point I think the French outstrip us

First By their Numerous Clergy their Missionaries being obedient
to their Superiors in the highest Degree and that Obedience
being one great Article of their Vow and strictly observd
amongst all their Orders

Secondly They always send abroad some of their Gentlemen
in Company of the Missionaries who upon their Arrival
are orderd out into the Wilderness to make Discoveries
and to acquaint themselves with the Savages of America and are obligd
to keep a strict Journal of all the Passages they meet withal
in order to present the same not only to their Governors and Fathers
but likewise to their Friends and Relations in France
which is industriously spread about that Kingdom to their Advantage
For their Monarch being a very good Judge of Mens Deserts
does not often let Money or Interest make Men of Parts give Place
to others of less Worth This breeds an Honourable Emulation amongst them
to outdo one another even in Fatigues and Dangers whereby they gain
a good Correspondence with the Indians and acquaint themselves
with their Speech and Customs and so make considerable Discoveries
in a short time Witness their Journals from Canada to the Missisipi
and its several Branches where they have effected great Matters
in a few Years

Having spent most of my Time during my eight Years Abode in Carolina
in travelling I not only surveyd the SeaCoast and those Parts
which are already inhabited by the Christians but likewise viewd a spatious
Tract of Land lying betwixt the Inhabitants and the Ledges of Mountains
from whence our noblest Rivers have their Rise running towards the Ocean
where they water as pleasant a Country as any in Europe
the Discovery of which being never yet made publick I have
in the following Sheets given you a faithful Account thereof
wherein I have laid down every thing with Impartiality and Truth
which is indeed the Duty of every Author and preferable to a smooth Stile
accompanyd with Falsities and Hyperboles

Great Part of this pleasant and healthful Country is inhabited
by none but Savages who covet a Christian Neighbourhood
for the Advantage of Trade and enjoy all the Comforts of Life
free from Care and Want

But not to amuse my Readers any longer with the Encomium of Carolina
I refer em to my Journal and other more particular Description
of that Country and its Inhabitants which they will find
after the Natural History thereof in which I have been very exact
and for Methods sake rangd each Species under its distinct and proper Head





INTRODUCTION



In the Year 1700 when People flockd from all Parts of the Christian World
to see the Solemnity of the Grand Jubilee at Rome my Intention
at that Time being to travel I accidentally met with a Gentleman
who had been Abroad and was very well acquainted with the Ways of Living
in both Indies of whom having made Enquiry concerning them
he assurd me that Carolina was the best Country I could go to
and that there then lay a Ship in the Thames in which I might have
my Passage I laid hold on this Opportunity and was not long on Board
before we fell down the River and saild to Cowes where having taken in
some Passengers we proceeded on our Voyage till we sprung aleak
and were forcd into the Islands of Scilly Here we spent about 10 Days
in refitting in which Time we had a great deal of Diversion
in Fishing and Shooting on those rocky Islands The Inhabitants
were very courteous and civil especially the Governor
to whose good Company and Favour we were very much obligd
There is a Town on one of these Islands where is good Entertainment
for those that happen to come in though the Land is but mean
and Fleshmeat not Plenty They have good Store of Rabbits Quails and Fish
and you see at the poor Peoples Doors great Heaps of Perriwinkleshells
those Fish being a great Part of their Food On the 1st Day of May
having a fair Wind at East we put to Sea and were on the Ocean
without speaking to any Vessel except a Ketch bound from New England
to Barbadoes laden with Horses Fish and Provisions
till the latter End of July when the Winds hung so much Southerly
that we could not get to our Port but put into Sandyhookbay and went up
to New York after a pinching Voyage causd by our long Passage
We found at the WateringPlace a French Man of War
who had on Board Men and Necessaries to make a Colony
and was intended for the Messiasippi River there to settle
The Country of NewYork is very pleasant in Summer but in the Winter
very cold as all the Northern Plantations are Their chief Commodities
are Provisions Bread Beer Lumber and Fish in abundance
all which are very good and some Skins and Furrs are hence exported
The City is governd by a Mayor as in England is seated on an Island
and lies very convenient for Trade and Defence having a regular Fort
and well mounted with Guns The Buildings are generally
of a smaller Sort of Flemish Brick and of the Dutch Fashion
excepting some few Houses They are all very firm and good Work
and conveniently placd as is likewise the Town which gives
a very pleasant Prospect of the neighbouring Islands and Rivers
A good Part of the Inhabitants are Dutch in whose Hands
this Colony once was After a Fortnights Stay here
we put out from Sandyhook and in 14 Days after arrivd at CharlesTown
the Metropolis of South Carolina which is soituate
in 32 45 North Latitude and admits of large Ships to come over their Bar
up to the Town where is a very commodious Harbour about 5 Miles distant
from the Inlet and stands on a Point very convenient for Trade
being seated between two pleasant and navigable Rivers The Town has
very regular and fair Streets in which are good Buildings of Brick and Wood
and since my coming thence has had great Additions of beautiful
large Brickbuildings besides a strong Fort and regular Fortifications made
to defend the Town The Inhabitants by their wise Management and Industry
have much improvd the Country which is in as thriving Circumstances
at this Time as any Colony on the Continent of English America
and is of more Advantage to the Crown of Great Britain than any of
the other more Northerly Plantations Virginia and Maryland excepted
This Colony was at first planted by a genteel Sort of People
that were well acquainted with Trade and had either Money or Parts
to make good Use of the Advantages that offerd as most of them have done
by raising themselves to great Estates and considerable Places of Trust
and Posts of Honour in this thriving Settlement Since the first Planters
abundance of French and others have gone over and raisd themselves
to considerable Fortunes They are very neat and exact
in Packing and Shipping of their Commodities which Method has got them
so great a Character Abroad that they generally come to a good Market
with their Commodities when oftentimes the Product of other Plantations
are forcd to be sold at lower Prizes They have a considerable Trade
both to Europe and the West Indies whereby they become rich
and are supplyd with all Things necessary for Trade and genteel Living
which several other Places fall short of Their cohabiting in a Town
has drawn to them ingenious People of most Sciences whereby they have
Tutors amongst them that educate their Youth alamode

Their Roads with great Industry are made very good and pleasant
Near the Town is built a fair Parsonagehouse with necessary Offices
and the Minister has a very considerable Allowance from his Parish
There is likewise a French Church in Town of the Reformd Religion
and several Meetinghouses for dissenting Congregations who all enjoy
at this Day an entire Liberty of their Worship the Constitution
of this Government allowing all Parties of wellmeaning Christians
to enjoy a free Toleration and possess the same Priviledges
so long as they appear to behave themselves peaceably and well
It being the Lords Proprietors Intent that the Inhabitants of Carolina
should be as free from Oppression as any in the Universe
which doubtless they will if their own Differences amongst themselves
do not occasion the contrary

They have a welldisciplind Militia their Horse are most Gentlemen
and well mounted and the best in America and may equalize
any in other Parts Their Officers both Infantry and Cavalry
generally appear in scarlet Mountings and as rich as in most Regiments
belonging to the Crown which shews the Richness and Grandeur of this Colony
They are a Fronteer and prove such troublesome Neighbours to the Spaniards
that they have once laid their Town of St Augustine in Ashes
and drove away their Cattle besides many Encounters and Engagements
in which they have defeated them too tedious to relate here
What the French got by their Attempt against South Carolina
will hardly ever be rankd amongst their Victories their Admiral Mouville
being glad to leave the Enterprize and run away after he had sufferd
all the Loss and Disgrace he was capable of receiving They are
absolute Masters over the Indians and carry so strict a Hand
over such as are within the Circle of their Trade that none does
the least Injury to any of the English but he is presently sent for
and punishd with Death or otherwise according to the Nature of the Fault
They have an entire Friendship with the neighbouring Indians
of several Nations which are a very warlike People ever faithful
to the English and have provd themselves brave and true
on all Occasions and are a great Help and Strength to this Colony
The Chief of the savage Nations have heretofore groand
under the Spanish Yoke and having experiencd their Cruelty
are become such mortal Enemies to that People that they never give
a Spaniard Quarter but generally when they take any Prisoners
if the English be not near to prevent it sculp them that is
to take their Hair and Skin of their Heads which they often flea away
whilst the Wretch is alive Notwithstanding the English have usd
all their Endeavours yet they could never bring them to leave
this Barbarity to the Spaniards who as they alledge
use to murder them and their Relations and make Slaves of them
to build their Forts and Towns

This Place is more plentiful in Money than most or indeed
any of the Plantations on the Continent besides they build
a considerable Number of Vessels of Cedar and other Wood
with which they trade to Cuirassau and the West Indies
from one they bring Money and from the other the Produce of their Islands
which yields a necessary Supply of both to the Colony Their Stocks of Cattle
are incredible being from one to two thousand Head in one Mans Possession
These feed in the Savannas and other Grounds and need no Fodder
in the Winter Their Mutton and Veal is good and their Pork is not inferior
to any in America As for Pitch and Tar none of the Plantations
are comparable for affording the vast Quantities of Naval Stores
as this Place does There have been heretofore some Discoveries of rich Mines
in the mountanous Part of this Country but being remote from
the present Settlement and the Inhabitants not well versd
in ordering Minerals they have been laid aside till a more
fit Opportunity happens There are several noble Rivers
and spacious Tracts of rich Land in their Lordships Dominions
lying to the Southward which are yet uninhabited besides Port Royal
a rare Harbour and Inlet having many Inhabitants thereon
which their Lordships have now made a Port for Trade This will be
a most advantageous Settlement lying so commodiously for Ships
coming from the Gulph and the Richness of the Land which is reported
to be there These more Southerly Parts will afford Oranges Limons
Limes and many other Fruits which the Northerly Plantations yield not

The Merchants of Carolina are fair frank Traders The Gentlemen
seated in the Country are very courteous live very nobly in their Houses
and give very genteel Entertainment to all Strangers and others that come
to visit them And since the Produce of South and North Carolina
is the same unless Silk which this Place produces great Quantities of
and very good North Carolina having never made any Tryal thereof as yet
therefore I shall refer the natural Produce of this Country
to that Part which treats of North Carolina whose Productions
are much the same The Christian Inhabitants of both Colonies pretty equal
but the Slaves of South Carolina are far more in Number than those
in the North I shall now proceed to relate my Journey thro the Country
from this Settlement to the other and then treat of the natural History
of Carolina with other remarkable Circumstances which I have met with
during my eight Years Abode in that Country





 A
 JOURNAL
 of
A thousand Miles Travel among the Indians from South to North Carolina



Saturday
On December the 28th 1700 I began my Voyage for North Carolina
from CharlesTown being six Englishmen in Company
with three Indianmen and one Woman Wife to our IndianGuide
having five Miles from the Town to the Breach we went down in a large Canoe
that we had provided for our Voyage thither having the Tide of Ebb
along with us which was so far spent by that Time we got down
that we had not Water enough for our Craft to go over although we drew
but two Foot or thereabouts This Breach is a Passage through a Marsh
lying to the Northward of Sullivans Island the Pilots having
a Look out thereon lying very commodious for Mariners on that Coast
making a good LandMark in so level a Country this Bar being
difficult to hit where an Observation hath been wanting for a Day or two
North East Winds bringing great Fogs Mists and Rains
which towards the cool Months of October November
and until the latter End of March often appear in these Parts
There are three Pilots to attend and conduct Ships over the Bar
The Harbour where the Vessels generally ride is against the Town
on Coopers River lying within a Point which parts that and AshleyRiver
they being Land lockd almost on all Sides

At 4 in the Afternoon at half Flood we passd with our Canoe
over the Breach leaving Sullivans Island on our Starboard
The first Place we designd for was Santee River on which
there is a Colony of French Protestants allowd and encouragd
by the Lords Proprietors At Night we got to BellsIsland
a poor Spot of Land being about ten Miles round where livd at that Time
a Bermudian being employd here with a Boy to look after
a Stock of Cattle and Hogs by the Owner of this Island
One Side of the Roof of his House was thatchd with Palmetoleaves
the other open to the Heavens thousands of Musketoes and other
troublesome Insects tormenting both Man and Beast inhabiting these Islands
Palmetotrees The Palmetotrees whose Leaves growing only
on the Top of the Tree in the Shape of a Fan and in a Cluster
like a Cabbage this Tree in Carolina when at its utmost Growth
is about forty or fifty Foot in Height and two Foot through
Its worth mentioning that the Growth of the Tree is not perceivable
in the Age of any Man the Experiment having been often tryd in Bermudas
and elsewhere which shews the slow Growth of this Vegitable
the Wood of it being porous and stringy like some Canes
the Leaves thereof the Bermudians make Womens Hats Bokeets
Baskets and pretty Dressingboxes a great deal being transported
to Pensilvania and other Northern Parts of America
where they do not grow for the same Manufacture The People of Carolina
make of the Fans of this Tree Brooms very serviceable
to sweep their Houses withal

We took up our Lodging this Night with the Bermudian our Entertainment
was very indifferent there being no fresh Water to be had on the Island

The next Morning we set away thro the Marshes about Noon we reachd
another Island calld Dixs Island much like to the former tho larger
there livd an honest Scot who gave us the best Reception
his Dwelling afforded being well provided of Oatmeal
and several other Effects he had found on that Coast
which Goods belongd to that unfortunate Vessel the Rising Sun
a Scotch Man of War lately arrivd from the Istmus of Darien
and cast away near the Bar of Ashley River the September before
Capt Gibson of Glasco then commanding her who with above an hundred Men
then on Board her Septem 5 1700 were every Soul drownd
in that terrible Gust which then happend most of the Corps being taken up
were carefully interrd by Mr Graham their Lieutenant who happily
was on Shore during the Tempest

After Dinner we left our Scotch Landlord and went that Night
to the North East Point of the Island It being dark ere we got there
our Canoe struck on a Sand near the Breakers and were in great Danger
of our Lives but by Gods Blessing got off safe to the Shore
where we lay all Night

Monday
In the Morning we set forwards on our intended Voyage About two a Clock
we got to Bulls Island which is about thirty Miles long
and hath a great Number of both Cattel and Hogs upon it
the Cattel being very wild and the Hogs very lean These two last Islands
belong to one Colonel Cary an Inhabitant of South Carolina
Although it were Winter yet we found such Swarms of Musketoes
and other troblesome Insects that we got but little Rest that Night

Tuesday
The next Day we intended for a small Island on the other Side of SeweeBay
which joining to these Islands Shipping might come to victual or careen
but there being such a Burden of those Flies that few or none
cares to settle there so the Stock thereon are run wild
We were gotten about half Way to RacoonIsland when there sprung up
a tart Gale at NW which put us in some Danger of being cast away
the Bay being rough and there running great Seas between the two Islands
which are better than four Leagues asunder a strong Current of a Tide
setting in and out which made us turn Tail to it and got our Canoe
right before the Wind and came safe into a Creek that is joining to
the North End of Bulls Island We sent our Indians to hunt
who brought us two Deers which were very poor and their Maws
full of large Grubs

Wednesday
On the Morrow we went and visited the Eastermost Side of this Island
it joining to the Ocean having very fair sandy Beeches
pavd with innumerable Sorts of curious pretty Shells very pleasant
to the Eye Amongst the rest we found the Spanish OysterShell
whence come the Pearls They are very large and of a different Form
from other Oysters their Colour much resembles the TortoiseShell
when it is dressd There was left by the Tide several strange Species
of a muciligmous slimy Substance though living and very aptly movd
at their first Appearance yet being left on the dry Sand
by the Beams of the Sun soon exhale and vanish

At our Return to our Quarters the Indians had killd two more Deer
two wild Hogs and three Racoons all very lean except the Racoons
We had great Store of Oysters Conks and Clanns a large Sort of Cockles
These Parts being very well furnishd with ShellFish
Turtle of several Sorts but few or none of the green
with other Sorts of Saltwater Fish and in the Season good Plenty of Fowl
as Curleus Gulls Gannets and Pellicans besides Duck and Mallard
Geese Swans Teal Widgeon c

Thursday
On Thursday Morning we left Bulls Island and went thro the Creeks
which lie between the Bay and the main Land At Noon we went on Shore
and got our Dinner near a Plantation on a Creek having
the full Prospect of SeweeBay We sent up to the House
but found none at Home but a Negro of whom our Messenger purchasd some
small Quantity of Tobacco and Rice We came to a deserted Indian Residence
calld Avendaughbough where we rested that Night

Friday
The next Day we enterd SanteeRivers Mouth where is fresh Water
occasiond by the extraordinary Current that comes down continually
With hard Rowing we got two Leagues up the River lying all Night
in a swampy Piece of Ground the Weather being so cold all that Time
we were almost frozen ere Morning leaving the Impressions of our Bodies
on the wet Ground We set forward very early in the Morning
to seek some better Quarters

Saturday
As we rowd up the River we found the Land towards the Mouth
and for about sixteen Miles up it scarce any Thing but Swamp and Percoarson
Percoarson a Sort of low Land affording vast CiprusTrees
of which the French make Canoes that will carry fifty or sixty Barrels
After the Tree is moulded and dug they saw them in two Pieces
and so put a Plank between and a small Keel to preserve them
from the OysterBanks which are innumerable in the Creeks and Bays
betwixt the French Settlement and CharlesTown They carry two Masts
and Bermudas Sails which makes them very handy and fit for their Purpose
for although their River fetches its first Rise from the Mountains
and continues a Current some hundreds of Miles ere it disgorges it self
having no sound Bay or SandBanks betwixt the Mouth thereof and the Ocean
Notwithstanding all this with the vast Stream it affords at all Seasons
and the repeated Freshes it so often allarms the Inhabitants with
by laying under Water great Part of their Country yet the Mouth is barrd
affording not above four or five Foot Water at the Entrance
As we went up the River we heard a great Noise as if two Parties
were engagd against each other seeming exactly like small Shot
Sewee Indians When we approachd nearer the Place we found it to be
some Sewee Indians firing the Canes Swamps which drives out the Game
then taking their particular Stands kill great Quantities of both Bear Deer
Turkies and what wild Creatures the Parts afford

These Sewees have been formerly a large Nation though now
very much decreasd since the English hath seated their Land
and all other Nations of Indians are observd to partake of the same Fate
where the Europeans come the Indians being a People
very apt to catch any Distemper they are afflicted withal
the SmallPox has destroyd many thousands of these Natives
who no sooner than they are attackd with the violent Fevers
and the Burning which attends that Distemper fling themselves over Head
in the Water in the very Extremity of the Disease which shutting up
the Pores hinders a kindly Evacuation of the pestilential Matter
and drives it back by which Means Death most commonly ensues
not but in other Distempers which are epidemical you may find among em
Practitioners that have extraordinary Skill and Success in removing
those morbifick Qualities which afflict em not often going above 100 Yards
from their Abode for their Remedies some of their chiefest Physicians
commonly carrying their Compliment of Drugs continually about them
which are Roots Barks Berries Nuts c that are strung upon a Thread
So like a Pomander the Physician wears them about his Neck
An Indian hath been often found to heal an Englishman of a Malady
for the Value of a MatchCoat which the ablest of our English Pretenders
in America after repeated Applications have deserted the Patient
as incurable God having furnishd every Country with specifick Remedies
for their peculiar Diseases

Rum
Rum a Liquor now so much in Use with them that they will part with
the dearest Thing they have to purchase it and when they have got a little
in their Heads are the impatients Creatures living till they have enough
to make em quite drunk and the most miserable Spectacles when they are so
some falling into the Fires burn their Legs or Arms contracting the Sinews
and become Cripples all their Lifetime others from Precipices break
their Bones and Joints with abundance of Instances yet none are so great
to deter them from that accursd Practice of Drunkenness though sensible
how many of them are by it hurryd into the other World before their Time
as themselves oftentimes will confess The Indians I was now speaking of
were not content with the common Enemies that lessen and destroy
their Countrymen but invented an infallible Stratagem to purge their Tribe
and reduce their Multitude into far less Numbers Their Contrivance was thus
as a Trader amongst them informd me

They seeing several Ships coming in to bring the English Supplies
from Old England one chief Part of their Cargo being for a Trade
with the Indians some of the craftiest of them had observd
that the Ships came always in at one Place which made them very confident
that Way was the exact Road to England and seeing so many Ships
come thence they believd it could not be far thither
esteeming the English that were among them no better than Cheats
and thought if they could carry the Skins and Furs they got
themselves to England which were inhabited with a better Sort of People
than those sent amongst them that then they should purchase
twenty times the Value for every Pelt they sold Abroad
in Consideration of what Rates they sold for at Home The intended Barter
was exceeding well approvd of and after a general Consultation
of the ablest Heads amongst them it was Nemine Contradicente
agreed upon immediately to make an Addition of their Fleet
by building more Canoes and those to be of the best Sort
and biggest Size as fit for their intended Discovery Some Indians
were employd about making the Canoes others to hunting
every one to the Post he was most fit for all Endeavours tending towards
an able Fleet and Cargo for Europe The Affair was carryd on
with a great deal of Secrecy and Expedition so as in a small Time
they had gotten a Navy Loading Provisions and Hands ready
to set Sail leaving only the Old Impotent and Minors at Home
till their successful Return They never hearing more of their Fleet
The Wind presenting they set up their MatSails and were scarce
out of Sight when there rose a Tempest which its supposd
carryd one Part of these Indian Merchants by Way of the other World
whilst the others were taken up at Sea by an English Ship
and sold for Slaves to the Islands The Remainder are better satisfyd
with their Imbecilities in such an Undertaking nothing affronting them more
than to rehearse their Voyage to England

There being a strong Current in SanteeRiver causd us to make
small Way with our Oars With hard Rowing we got that Night
to Mons Eugees House which stands about fifteen Miles up the River
being the first Christian dwelling we met withal in that Settlement
and were very courteously receivd by him and his Wife

Many of the French follow a Trade with the Indians
living very conveniently for that Interest There is about seventy Families
seated on this River who live as decently and happily as any Planters
in these Southward Parts of America The French being
a temperate industrious People some of them bringing very little of Effects
yet by their Endeavours and mutual Assistance amongst themselves
which is highly to be commended have outstript our English
who brought with em larger Fortunes though as it seems less endeavour
to manage their Talent to the best Advantage Tis admirable to see
what Time and Industry will with Gods Blessing effect
Carolina affording many strange Revolutions in the Age of a Man
daily Instances presenting themselves to our View of so many
from despicable Beginnings which in a short Time arrive
to very splended Conditions Here Propriety hath a large Scope
there being no strict Laws to bind our Privileges A Quest after Game
being as freely and peremptorily enjoyd by the meanest Planter
as he that is the highest in Dignity or wealthiest in the Province
Deer and other Game that are naturally wild being not immurd
or preservd within Boundaries to satisfy the Appetite of the Rich alone
A poor Labourer that is Master of his Gun c hath as good a Claim
to have continud Coarses of Delicacies crouded upon his Table
as he that is Master of a greater Purse

We lay all that Night at Mons Eugees and the next Morning
set out farther to go the Remainder of our Voyage by Land
At ten a Clock we passd over a narrow deep Swamp having left
the three Indian Men and one Woman that had pilotted the Canoe
from AshlyRiver having hird a SeweeIndian a tall lusty Fellow
who carryd a Pack of our Cloaths of great Weight
notwithstanding his Burden we had much ado to keep pace with him
At Noon we came up with several French Plantations meeting with
several Creeks by the Way the French were very officious
in assisting with their small Dories to pass over these Waters
whom we met coming from their Church being all of them
very clean and decent in their Apparel their Houses and Plantations
suitable in Neatness and Contrivance They are all of the same Opinion
with the Church of Geneva there being no Difference amongst them
concerning the Punctilios of their Christian Faith which Union
hath propagated a happy and delightful Concord in all other Matters
throughout the whole Neighbourhood living amongst themselves as one Trible
or Kindred every one making it his Business to be assistant
to the Wants of his Countryman preserving his Estate and Reputation
with the same Exactness and Concern as he does his own all seeming
to share in the Misfortunes and rejoyce at the Advance and Rise
of their Brethren

Towards the Afternoon we came to Mons LJandro where we got our Dinner
there coming some French Ladies whilst we were there
who were lately come from England and Mons LGrand a worthy Norman
who hath been a great Sufferer in his Estate by the Persecution in France
against those of the Protestant Religion This Gentleman very kindly
invited us to make our Stay with him all Night but we being intended farther
that Day took our Leaves returning Acknowledgments of their Favours

About 4 in the Afternoon we passd over a large Ciprus run
in a small Canoe the French Doctor sent his Negro to guide us
over the Head of a large Swamp so we got that Night
to Mons Galliars the elder who lives in a very curious contrivd House
built of Brick and Stone which is gotten near that Place Near here comes in
the Road from CharlesTown and the rest of the English Settlement
it being a very good Way by Land and not above 36 Miles
altho more than 100 by Water and I think the most difficult Way I ever saw
occasiond by Reason of the multitude of Creeks lying along the Main
keeping their Course thro the Marshes turning and winding
like a Labyrinth having the Tide of Ebb and Flood twenty Times
in less than three Leagues going

Monday
The next Morning very early we ferryd over a Creek that runs near the House
and after an Hours Travel in the Woods we came to the Riverside
where we stayd for the Indian who was our Guide and was gone round
by Water in a small Canoe to meet us at that Place we rested at
He came after a small Time and ferryd us in that little Vessel
over Santee River 4 Miles and 84 Miles in the Woods
which the overflowing of the Freshes which then came down
had made a perfect Sea of there running an incredible Current in the River
which had cast our small Craft and us away had we not had
this Sewee Indian with us who are excellent Artists in managing
these small Canoes

Santee River at this Time from the usual Depth of Water
was risen perpendicular 36 Foot always making a Breach from her Banks
about this Season of the Year The general Opinion of the Cause thereof
is supposd to proceed from the overflowing of fresh WaterLakes
that lie near the Head of this River and others upon the same Continent
But my Opinion is that these vast Inundations proceed from
the great and repeated Quantities of Snow that falls upon the Mountains
which lie at so great a Distance from the Sea therefore they have
no Help of being dissolvd by those saline piercing Particles
as other adjacent Parts near the Ocean receive and therefore
lies and increases to a vast Bulk until some mild Southerly Breezes
coming on a sudden continue to unlock these frozen Bodies
congeald by the NorthWest Wind dissipating them in Liquids
and coming down with Impetuosity fills those Branches that feed these Rivers
and causes this strange Deluge which ofttimes lays under Water
the adjacent Parts on both Sides this Current for several Miles distant
from her Banks tho the French and Indians affirmd to me
they never knew such an extraordinary Flood there before

We all by Gods Blessing and the Endeavours of our IndianPilot
passd safe over the River but was lost in the Woods which seemd like
some great Lake except here and there a Knowl of high Land
which appeard above Water

We intended for Mons Galliars jun but was lost none of us
knowing the Way at that Time altho the Indian was born in that Country
it having receivd so strange a Metamorphosis We were in several Opinions
concerning the right Way the Indian and my self supposd the House
to bear one Way the rest thought to the contrary we differing
it was agreed on amongst us that one half should go with the Indian
to find the House and the other part to stay upon one of these dry Spots
until some of them returnd to us and informd us where it lay

My self and two more were left behind by Reason the Canoe
would not carry us all we had but one Gun amongst us one Load of Ammunition
and no Provision Had our Men in the Canoe miscarryd
we must in all Probability there have perishd

In about six Hours Time from our Mens Departure the Indian came back to us
in the same Canoe he went in being half drunk which assurd us
they had found some Place of Refreshment He took us three into the Canoe
telling us all was well Padling our Vessel several Miles thro the Woods
being often half full of Water but at length we got safe to the Place
we sought for which provd to lie the same Way the Indian and I
guessd it did

When we got to the House we found our Comrades in the same Trim
the Indian was in and several of the French Inhabitants with them
who treated us very courteously wondering at our undertaking such a Voyage
thro a Country inhabited by none but Savages and them of so different
Nations and Tongues

After we had refreshd our selves we parted from a very kind loving
and affable People who wishd us a safe and prosperous Voyage

Hearing of a Camp of Santee Indians not far of we set out
intending to take up our Quarters with them that Night There being
a deep Run of Water in the Way one of our Company being topheavy
and there being nothing but a small Pole for a Bridge over a Creek
fell into the Water up to the Chin my self laughing at the Accident
and not taking good Heed to my Steps came to the same Misfortune
All our Bedding was wet The Wind being at NW it froze very hard
which prepard such a Nights Lodging for me that I never desire
to have the like again the wet Bedding and freezing Air
had so qualifyd our Bodies that in the Morning when we awakd
we were nigh frozen to Death until we had recruited our selves
before a large Fire of the Indians

Tuesday
Tuesday Morning we set towards the Congerees leaving the Indian Guide
Scipio drunk amongst the SanteeIndians We went ten Miles
out of our Way to head a great Swamp the Freshes having filld them all
with such great Quantities of Water that the usual Paths
were renderd unpassable We met in our Way with an Indian Hut
where we were entertaind with a fat boild Goose Venison Racoon
and ground Nuts We made but little Stay about Noon we passd by
several large Savannahs wherein is curious Ranges for Cattel
being green all the Year they were plentifully stord with Cranes
Geese c and the adjacent Woods with great Flocks of Turkies
This Day we travelld about 30 Miles and lay all Night at a House
which was built for the Indian Trade the Master thereof
we had parted with at the French Town who gave us Leave
to make use of his Mansion Such Houses are common in these Parts
and especially where there is Indian Towns and Plantations near at hand
which this Place is well furnishd withal

These SanteeIndians are a wellhumourd and affable People
and living near the English are become very tractable
They make themselves Cribs after a very curious Manner
wherein they secure their Corn from Vermin which are more frequent
in these warm Climates than Countries more distant from the Sun
These pretty Fabricks are commonly supported with eight Feet or Posts
about seven Foot high from the Ground well daubd within and without
upon Laths with Loom or Clay which makes them tight and fit to keep out
the smallest Insect there being a small Door at the gable End
which is made of the same Composition and to be removd at Pleasure
being no bigger than that a slender Man may creep in at
cementing the Door up with the same Earth when they take Corn
out of the Crib and are going from Home always finding their Granaries
in the same Posture they left them Theft to each other being
altogether unpractisd never receiving Spoils but from Foreigners

Hereabouts the Ground is something higher than about CharlesTown
there being found some Quarries of brown free Stone which I have seen
made Use of for Building and hath provd very durable and good
The Earth here is mixd with white Gravel which is rare
there being nothing like a Stone to be found of the natural Produce
near to AshlyRiver

Wednesday
The next Day about Noon we came to the Side of a great Swamp
where we were forcd to strip our selves to get over it
which with much Difficulty we effected Septem 5 1700
Hereabouts the late Gust of Wind which happend in September last
had torn the large CiprusTrees and Timbers up by the Roots
they lying confusedly in their Branches did block up the Way
making the Passage very difficult

This Night we got to one Scipios Hutt a famous Hunter
There was no Body at Home but we having in our Company
one that had usd to trade amongst them we made our selves welcome
to what his Cabin afforded which is a Thing common
the Indians allowing it practicable to the English Traders
to take out of their Houses what they need in their Absence
in Lieu whereof they most commonly leave some small Gratuity of Tobacco
Paint Beads c We found great Store of Indian Peas a very good Pulse
Beans Oyl Thinkapin Nuts Corn barbacud Peaches and PeachBread
which Peaches being made into a Quiddony and so made up into Loves
like BarleyCakes these cut into thin Slices and dissolvd in Water
makes a very grateful Acid and extraordinary beneficial in Fevers
as hath often been tryd and approvd on by our English Practitioners
The Wind being at NW with cold Weather made us make a large Fire
in the Indians Cabin being very intent upon our Cookery
we set the Dwelling on Fire and with much ado put it out
tho with the Loss of Part of the Roof

Thursday
The next Day we travelld on our Way and about Noon came up
with a Settlement of Santee Indians there being Plantations
lying scattering here and there for a great many Miles
They came out to meet us being acquainted with one of our Company
and made us very welcome with fat barbacud Venison
which the Woman of the Cabin took and tore in Pieces with her Teeth
so put it into a Mortar beating it to Rags afterwards stews it with Water
and other Ingredients which makes a very savoury Dish

At these Cabins came to visit us the King of the Santee Nation
He brought with him their chief Doctor or Physician who was warmly and neatly
clad with a MatchCoat made of Turkies Feathers which makes a pretty Shew
seeming as if it was a Garment of the deepest silk Shag
This Doctor had the Misfortune to lose his Nose by the Pox
which Disease the Indians often get by the English Traders
that use amongst them not but the Natives of America have for many Ages
by their own Confession been afflicted with a Distemper
much like the Lues Venerea which hath all the Symptoms of the Pox
being different in this only for I never could learn
that this CountryDistemper or Yawes is begun or continud
with a Gonorrhoea yet is attended with nocturnal Pains in the Limbs
and commonly makes such a Progress as to vent Part of the Matter by Botches
and several Ulcers in the Body and other Parts oftentimes Death ensuing
I have known mercurial Unguents and Remedies work a Cure
following the same Methods as in the Pox several white People
but chiefly the Criolos losing their Palates and Noses
by this devouring Vulture

It is epidemical visiting these Parts of America which is often occasiond
thro the immoderate drinking of Rum by those that commonly drink Water
at other Times cold Nights Lodging and bad open Houses and more chiefly
by often wetting the Feet and eating such Quantities of Pork as they do
which is a gross Food and a great Propagator of such Juices
as it often meets withal in human Bodies once tainted with this Malady
which may differently in some Respects act its Tragedy
the Change being occasiond by the Difference of Climates and Bodies
as in Europe We being well enough assurd that the Pox had its first Rise
known to us in this new World it being caught of the Indian Women
by the Spanish Soldiers that followd Columbus in one of his Expeditions
to America who after their Arrival in Old Spain were hastend
to the Relief of Naples at that Time besiegd by the French
Provisions growing scarce the useless People were turnd out of the City
to lessen the Mouths amongst these the Curtesans were one Part
who had frequently embracd the Spaniards being well fraught with Riches
by their new Discovery The Leager Ladies had no sooner lost
their Spanish Dons but found themselves as well entertaind
by the French whose Camp they traded in giving the Mounsieurs
as large a Share of the pocky Spoils within their own Lines
as the Spaniards had who took the Pains to bring it in their Breeches
as far as from America the large Supplies of Swines Flesh
which that Army was chiefly victualld withal made it rage
The Siege was raisd the French and Spaniards retreating to Flanders
which was a Parrade of all Nations by which Means this filthy Distemper
crowded it self into most Nations of the known World

Now to return to our Doctor who in the Time of his Affliction
withdrew himself with one that labourd under the same Distemper
into the Woods These two perfected their Cures by
proper Vegitables c of which they have Plenty and are well acquainted
with their specifick Virtue

I have seen such admirable Cures performd by these Savages which would
puzzle a great many graduate Practitioners to trace their Steps in Healing
with the same Expedition Ease and Success using no racking Instruments
in their Chirurgery nor nice Rules of Diet and Physick to verify the Saying
qui Medice vivit misere vivit In Wounds which penetrate deep
and seem mortal they order a spare Diet with drinking Fountainwater
if they perceive a white Matter or Pus to arise they let the Patient
more at large and presently cure him

After these two had performd their Cures at no easier Rate
than the Expence of both their Noses coming again amongst
their old Acquaintance so disfigurd the Indians admird to see them
metamorphosd after that manner enquird of them where they had been
all that Time and what were become of their Noses They made Answer
That they had been conversing with the white Man above
meaning God Almighty how they were very kindly entertaind
by that Great Being he being much pleasd with their Ways
and had promisd to make their Capacities equal with the white People
in making Guns Ammunition c in Retalliation of which
they had given him their Noses The Verity of which they yet hold
the Indians being an easy credulous People and most notoriously cheated
by their Priests and Conjurers both Trades meeting ever in one Person
and most commonly a Spice of Quackship added to the other two Ingredients
which renders that cunning Knave the Impostor to be more relyd upon
thence a fitter Instrument to cheat these ignorant People
the Priest and Conjurers being never admitted to their Practice
till Years and the Experience of repeated Services hath wrought their Esteem
amongst the Nations they belong to

The Santee King who was in Company with this Nonosd Doctor
is the most absolute Indian Ruler in these Parts although he is Head
but of a small People in Respect to some other Nations of Indians
that I have seen He can put any of his People to Death that hath committed
any Fault which he judges worthy of so great a Punishment
This Authority is rarely found amongst these Savages
for they act not commonly by a determinative Voice in their Laws
towards any one that hath committed Murder or such other great Crime
but take this Method him to whom the Injury was done or if dead
the nearest of his Kindred prosecutes by Way of an actual Revenge
being himself if Opportunity serves his Intent both Judge and Executioner
performing so much Mischief on the Offender or his nearest Relation
until such Time that he is fully satisfyd Yet this Revenge
is not so infallible but it may be bought off with Beads Tobacco
and such like Commodities that are useful amongst them
though it were the most sable Villany that could be acted by Mankind

Some that attended the King presented me with an odoriferous balsamick Root
of a fragrant Smell and Taste the Name I know not they chew it in the Mouth
and by that simple Application heal desperate Wounds both green and old
that small Quantity I had was given inwardly to those troubld
with the Bellyach which Remedy faild not to give present Help
the Pain leaving the Patient soon after they had taken the Root

Near to these Cabins are several Tombs made after the manner
of these Indians the largest and the chiefest of them
was the Sepulchre of the late Indian King of the Santees
a Man of great Power not only amongst his own Subjects
but dreaded by the neighbouring Nations for his great Valour and Conduct
having as large a Prerogative in his Way of Ruling as the present King
I now spoke of

The manner of their Interment is thus A Mole or Pyramid of Earth
is raisd the Mould thereof being workd very smooth and even
sometimes higher or lower according to the Dignity of the Person
whose Monument it is On the Top thereof is an Umbrella made Ridgeways
like the Roof of an House this is supported by nine Stakes or small Posts
the Grave being about six or eight Foot in Length and four Foot in Breadth
about it is hung Gourds Feathers and other such like Trophies
placd there by the dead Mans Relations in Respect to him in the Grave
The other Part of the FuneralRites are thus As soon as the Party is dead
they lay the Corps upon a Piece of Bark in the Sun seasoning or embalming it
with a small Root beaten to Powder which looks as red as Vermilion
the same is mixd with Bears Oil to beautify the Hair
and preserve their Heads from being lousy it growing plentifully
in these Parts of America After the Carcass has laid a Day or two
in the Sun they remove and lay it upon Crotches cut on purpose
for the Support thereof from the Earth then they anoint it all over
with the forementiond Ingredients of the Powder of this Root
and Bears Oil When it is so done they cover it very exactly over
with Bark of the Pine or Cyprus Tree to prevent any Rain to fall upon it
sweeping the Ground very clean all about it Some of his nearest of Kin
brings all the temporal Estate he was possessd of at his Death
as Guns Bows and Arrows Beads Feathers Matchcoat c This Relation
is the chief Mourner being clad in Moss and a Stick in his Hand
keeping a mournful Ditty for three or four Days his Face being black
with the Smoak of Pitch Pine mingld with Bears Oil All the while
he tells the dead Mans Relations and the rest of the Spectators
who that dead Person was and of the great Feats performd in his Lifetime
all what he speaks tending to the Praise of the Defunct
As soon as the Flesh grows mellow and will cleave from the Bone
they get it off and burn it making all the Bones very clean
then anoint them with the Ingredients aforesaid wrapping up the Skull
very carefully in a Cloath artificially woven of Possums Hair
These Indians make Girdles Sashes Garters c after the same Manner
The Bones they carefully preserve in a wooden Box every Year
oiling and cleansing them By these Means preserve them for many Ages
that you may see an Indian in Possession of the Bones of his Grandfather
or some of his Relations of a larger Antiquity They have other
Sorts of Tombs as where an Indian is slain in that very Place
they make a Heap of Stones or Sticks where Stones are not to be found
to this Memorial every Indian that passes by adds a Stone
to augment the Heap in Respect to the deceasd Hero

We had a very large Swamp to pass over near the House and would have hird
our Landlord to have been our Guide but he seemd unwilling
so we pressd him no farther about it He was the tallest Indian
I ever saw being seven Foot high and a very strait compleat Person
esteemd on by the King for his great Art in Hunting always carrying with him
an artificial Head to hunt withal They are made of the Head of a Buck
the back Part of the Horns being scrapt and hollow for Lightness of Carriage
The Skin is left to the setting on of the Shoulders which is lind all round
with small Hoops and flat Sort of Laths to hold it open
for the Arm to go in They have a Way to preserve the Eyes as if living
The Hunter puts on a Matchcoat made of Deers Skin with the Hair on
and a Piece of the white Part of a Deers Skin that grows on the Breast
which is fastend to the NeckEnd of this stalking Head so hangs down
In these Habiliments an Indian will go as near a Deer as he pleases
the exact Motions and Behaviour of a Deer being so well counterfeited by em
that several Times it hath been known for two Hunters to come up
with a stalking Head together and unknown to each other
so that they have killd an Indian instead of a Deer
which hath happend sometimes to be a Brother or some dear Friend
for which Reason they allow not of that Sort of Practice
where the Nation is populous

Within half a Mile of the House we passd over a prodigious
wide and deep Swamp being forcd to strip starknaked
and much ado to save our selves from drowning in this Fatiegue
We with much ado got thro going that Day about five Miles farther
and came to three more Indian Cabins calld in the Indian Tongue
Hickerau by the English Traders the black House being pleasantly
seated on a high Bank by a Branch of SanteeRiver One of our Company
that had traded amongst these Indians told us That one of the Cabins
was his FathersinLaw he calld him so by Reason the old Man had given him
a young Indian Girl that was his Daughter to lie with him make Bread
and to be necessary in what she was capable to assist him in
during his Abode amongst them

When we came thither first there was no Body at Home so the Son made bold
to search his Fathers Granary for Corn and other Provisions
He brought us some Indian Maiz and Peas which are of a reddish Colour
and eat well yet colour the Liquor they are boild in
as if it were a Lixivium of red Tartar After we had been
about an Hour in the House where was Millions of Fleas
the Indian Cabins being often fuller of such Vermin than any DogKennel
the old Man came in to us and seemd very glad to see his SoninLaw

This Indian is a great Conjurer as appears by the Sequel
The Seretee or Santee Indians were gone to War against
the Hooks and Backhooks Nations living near the Mouth of WinyanRiver
Those that were left at Home which are commonly old People and Children
had heard no News a long Time of their Men at Arms This Man
at the Entreaty of these People being held to be a great Sorcerer
amongst em went to know what Posture their fighting Men were in
His Exorcism was carryd on thus He dressd himself in a clean white
dressd DeerSkin a great Fire being made in the Middle of the Plantation
the Indians sitting all round it the Conjurer was blindfolded
then he surrounded the Fire several Times I think thrice
leaving the Company he went into the Woods where he stayd
about half an Hour returning to them surrounded the Fire as before
leaving them went the second Time into the Woods at which Time there came
a huge Swarm of Flies very large they flying about the Fire several Times
at last fell all into it and were visibly consumd Immediately after
the IndianConjurer made a huge Lilleloo and howling very frightfully
presently an Indian went and caught hold of him leading him to the Fire
The old Wizard was so feeble and weak being not able to stand alone
and all over in a Sweat and as wet as if he had fallen into the River
After some Time he recoverd his Strength assuring them that their Men
were near a River and could not pass over it till so many Days
but would in such a Time return all in Safety to their Nation
All which provd true at the Indians Return which was not long after
This Story the Englishman his SoninLaw affirmd to me

The old Man stayd with us about two Hours and told us we were welcome
to stay there all Night and take what his Cabin afforded then leaving us
went into the Woods to some HuntingQuarter not far off

Friday
The next Morning early we pursud our Voyage finding the Land
to improve it self in Pleasantness and Richness of Soil
When we had gone about ten Miles one of our Company tird
being not able to travel any farther so we went forward
leaving the poor dejected Traveller with Tears in his Eyes
to return to CharlesTown and travel back again over so much bad Way
we having passd thro the worst of our Journey the Land here
being high and dry very few Swamps and those dry and a little Way through
We travelld about twenty Miles lying near a Savanna
that was overflown with Water where we were very short of Victuals
but finding the Woods newly burnt and on fire in many Places
which gave us great Hopes that Indians were not far of

Saturday 20 Miles
Next Morning very early we waded thro the Savanna the Path lying there
and about ten a Clock came to a hunting Quarter of a great many Santees
they made us all welcome shewing a great deal of Joy at our coming
giving us barbacud Turkeys Bears Oil and Venison

Here we hird Santee Jack a good Hunter and a wellhumourd Fellow
to be our Pilot to the Congeree Indians we gave him a StroudwaterBlew
to make his Wife an Indian Petticoat who went with her Husband
After two Hours Refreshment we went on and got that Day about twenty Miles
we lay by a small swift Run of Water which was pavd at the Bottom
with a Sort of Stone much like to Tripoli and so light
that I fancyd it would precipitate in no Stream but where it naturally grew
The Weather was very cold the Winds holding Northerly
We made our selves as merry as we could having a good Supper
with the Scraps of the Venison we had given us by the Indians
having killd 3 Teal and a Possum which Medly all together
made a curious Ragoo

Sunday 15 Miles
This Day all of us had a Mind to have rested but the Indian
was much against it alledging That the Place we lay at
was not good to hunt in telling us if we would go on by Noon
he would bring us to a more convenient Place so we movd forwards
and about twelve a Clock came to the most amazing Prospect I had seen
since I had been in Carolina we travelld by a Swampside
which Swamp I believe to be no less than twenty Miles over
the other Side being as far as I could well discern there appearing
great Ridges of Mountains bearing from us WNW One Alp with a Top
like a Sugarloaf advancd its Head above all the rest very considerably
the Day was very serene which gave us the Advantage of seeing a long Way
these Mountains were clothd all over with Trees which seemd to us
to be very large Timbers

At the Sight of this fair Prospect we stayd all Night our Indian
going about half an Hour before us had provided three fat Turkeys
eer we got up to him

The Swamp I now spoke of is not a miry Bog as others generally are
but you go down to it thro a steep Bank at the Foot of which
begins this Valley where you may go dry for perhaps 200 Yards
then you meet with a small Brook or Run of Water about 2 or 3 Foot deep
then dry Land for such another Space so another Brook thus continuing
The Land in this Percoarson or Valley being extraordinary rich
and the Runs of Water well stord with Fowl It is the Head
of one of the Branches of SanteeRiver but a farther Discovery
Time would not permit only one Thing is very remarkable
there growing all over this Swamp a tall lofty Baytree
but is not the same as in England these being in their Verdure
all the Winter long which appears here when you stand on the Ridge
where our Path lay as if it were one pleasant green Field
and as even as a Bowlinggreen to the Eye of the Beholder
being hemmd in on one Side with these Ledges of vast high Mountains

Viewing the Land here we found an extraordinary rich black Mould
and some of a Coppercolour both Sorts very good the Land in some Places
is much burthend with Iron Stone here being great Store of it
seemingly very good The eviling Springs which are many in these Parts
issuing out of the Rocks which Water we drank of it colouring
the Excrements of Travellers by its chalybid Quality as black as a Coal
When we were all asleep in the Beginning of the Night
we were awakend with the dismallst and most hideous Noise
that ever piercd my Ears This sudden Surprizal incapacitated us of guessing
what this threatning Noise might proceed from but our Indian Pilot
who knew these Parts very well acquainted us that it was customary
to hear such Musick along that Swampside there being
endless Numbers of Panthers Tygers Wolves and other Beasts of Prey
which take this Swamp for their Abode in the Day coming in whole Droves
to hunt the Deer in the Night making this frightful Ditty till Day appears
then all is still as in other Places

Monday
The next Day it provd a small drisly Rain which is rare
there happening not the tenth Part of Foggyfalling Weather
towards these Mountains as visits those Parts Near the Seaboard
the Indian killd 15 Turkeys this Day there coming out of the Swamp
about Sunrising Flocks of these Fowl containing several hundreds
in a Gang who feed upon the Acrons it being most Oak that grow
in these Woods There are but very few Pines in those Quarters

Early the next Morning we set forward for the CongereeIndians
parting with that delicious Prospect By the Way our Guide killd
more Turkeys and two Polcats which he eat esteeming them before
fat Turkeys Some of the Turkeys which we eat whilst we stayd there
I believe weighd no less than 40 Pounds

The Land we passd over this Day was most of it good and the worst passable
At Night we killd a Possum being cloyd with Turkeys made a Dish of that
which tasted much between young Pork and Veal their Fat being as white
as any I ever saw

Our Indian having this Day killd good Store of Provision with his Gun
he always shot with a single Ball missing but two Shoots in above forty
they being curious Artists in managing a Gun to make it carry either Ball
or Shot true When they have bought a Piece and find it to shoot
any Ways crooked they take the Barrel out of the Stock cutting a Notch
in a Tree wherein they set it streight sometimes shooting away
above 100 Loads of Ammunition before they bring the Gun to shoot
according to their Mind We took up our Quarters by a Fishpondside
the Pits in the Woods that stand full of Water naturally breed Fish in them
in great Quantities We cookd our Supper but having neither Bread or Salt
our fat Turkeys began to be loathsome to us altho we were never wanting
of a good Appetite yet a Continuance of one Diet made us weary

Wednesday
The next Morning Santee Jack told us we should reach
the Indian Settlement betimes that Day about Noon we passd by
several fair Savannas very rich and dry seeing great Copses of many Acres
that bore nothing but Bushes about the Bigness of Boxtrees
which in the Season afford great Quantities of small Blackberries
very pleasant Fruit and much like to our Blues or Huckleberries
that grow on Heaths in England Hard by the Savannas we found the Town
where we halted there was not above one Man left with the Women
the rest being gone a Hunting for a Feast The Women were very busily
engagd in Gaming The Name or Grounds of it I could not learn
tho I lookd on above two Hours Their Arithmetick was kept
with a Heap of Indian Grain When their Play was ended
the King or Cassettas Wife invited us into her Cabin The Indian Kings
always entertaining Travellers either English or Indian
taking it as a great Affront if they pass by their Cabins
and take up their Quarters at any other Indians House
The Queen set Victuals before us which good Compliment they use generally
as soon as you come under their Roof

The Town consists not of above a dozen Houses they having
other stragling Plantations up and down the Country and are seated upon
a small Branch of SanteeRiver Their Place hath curious dry Marshes
and Savannas adjoining to it and would prove an exceeding thriving Range
for Cattle and Hogs provided the English were seated thereon
Besides the Land is good for Plantations

These Indians are a small People having lost much of their former Numbers
by intestine Broils but most by the Smallpox which hath often visited them
sweeping away whole Towns occasiond by the immoderate
Government of themselves in their Sickness as I have mentiond before
treating of the Sewees Neither do I know any Savages that have traded
with the English but what have been great Losers by this Distemper

We found here good Store of ChinkapinNuts which they gather in Winter
great Quantities of drying them so keep these Nuts in great Baskets
for their Use likewise HickerieNuts which they beat betwixt
two great Stones then sift them so thicken their VenisonBroath therewith
the small Shells precipitating to the Bottom of the Pot
whilst the Kernel in Form of Flower mixes it with the Liquor
Both these Nuts made into Meal makes a curious Soop either with clear Water
or in any MeatBroth

From the Nation of Indians until such Time as you come to the Turkeiruros
in North Carolina you will see no long Moss upon the Trees
which Space of Ground contains above five hundred Miles
This seeming Miracle in Nature is occasiond by the Highness of the Land
it being dry and healthful for tho this Moss bears a Seed
in a Sort of a small Cod yet it is generated in or near low swampy Grounds

The Congerees are kind and affable to the English the Queen being
very kind giving us what Rarities her Cabin afforded as Loblolly made
with Indian Corn and dryd Peaches These Congerees have
abundance of Storks and Cranes in their Savannas They take them
before they can fly and breed em as tame and familiar
as a Dunghill Fowl They had a tame Crane at one of these Cabins
that was scarce less than six Foot in Height his Head being round
with a shining natural Crimson Hue which they all have
These are a very comely Sort of Indians there being
a strange Difference in the Proportion and Beauty of these Heathens
Altho their Tribes or Nations border one upon another yet you may discern
as great an Alteration in their Features and Dispositions
as you can in their Speech which generally proves quite different
from each other though their Nations be not above 10 or 20 Miles in Distance
The Women here being as handsome as most I have met withal
being several finefingerd Brounettos amongst them These Lasses
stick not upon Hand long for they marry when very young
as at 12 or 14 Years of Age The English Traders are seldom without
an Indian Female for his Bedfellow alledging these Reasons
as sufficient to allow of such a Familiarity First They being remote
from any white People that it preserves their Friendship with the Heathens
they esteeming a white Mans Child much above one of their getting
the Indian Mistress ever securing her white Friend Provisions whilst
he stays amongst them And lastly This Correspondence makes them learn
the Indian Tongue much the sooner they being of the Frenchmans Opinion
how that an English Wife teaches her Husband more English in one Night
than a Schoolmaster can in a Week

We saw at the Cassettas Cabin the strangest Spectacle of Antiquity
I ever knew it being an old Indian Squah that had I been to have guessd
at her Age by her Aspect old Parrs Head the Welch Methusalem
was a Face in SwadlingClouts to hers Her Skin hung in Reaves
like a Bag of Tripe By a fair Computation one might have justly thought
it would have containd three such Carcasses as hers then was
She had one of her Hands contracted by some Accident in the Fire
they sleeping always by it and often fall into sad Disasters
especially in their drunken Moods I made the strictest Enquiry
that was possible and by what I could gather she was considerably above
100 Years old notwithstanding she smoakd Tobacco and eat her Victuals
to all Appearance as heartily as one of 18 One of our Company
spoke some of their Language and having not quite forgotten
his former Intrigues with the Indian Lasses would fain have been dealing
with some of the young Female Fry but they refusd him
he having nothing that these Girls esteemd At Night we were laid
in the Kings Cabin where the Queen and the old Squah pigd in with us
The former was very much disfigurd with Tettars and very reservd
which disappointed our fellow Traveller in his Intrigues

The Women smoak much Tobacco as most Indians do They have Pipes
whose Heads are cut out of Stone and will hold an Ounce of Tobacco
and some much less They have large wooden Spoons as big as small Ladles
which they make little Use of lading the Meat out of the Bowls
with their Fingers

Thursday
In the Morning we rose before Day having hird a Guide over Night
to conduct us on our Way but it was too soon for him to stir out
the Indians never setting forward till the Sun is an Hour or two high
and hath exhalld the Dew from the Earth The Queen got us a good Breakfast
before we left her she had a young Child which was much afflicted
with the Cholick for which Distemper she infusd a Root in Water
which was held in a Goard this she took into her Mouth
and spurted it into the Infants which gave it ease After we had eaten
we set out with our new Guide for the Wateree Indians
We went over a great deal of indifferent Land this Day Here begins to appear
very good Marble which continues more and less for the Space of 500 Miles
We lay all Night by a Run of Water as we always do if possible
for the Convenience of it The Weather was very cold We went this Day
about 30 Miles from the Congerees

Friday
In the Morning we made no Stay to get our Breakfast but hasted on our Voyage
the Land increasing in Marble and Richness of Soil At Noon we halted
getting our Dinner upon a MarbleStone that rose it self
half a Foot above the Surface of the Earth and might contain
the Compass of a Quarter of an Acre of Land being very even
there growing upon it in some Places a small red Berry like a SalmonSpawn
there boiling out of the main Rock curious Springs of as delicious Water
as ever I drank in any Parts I ever travelld in

These Parts likewise affords good free Stone fit for Building
and of several Sorts The Land here is pleasantly seated
with pretty little Hills and Valleys the rising Sun at once shewing
his glorious reflecting Rays on a great many of these little Mountains
We went this Day about 20 Miles our Guide walking like a Horse till we had
sadld him with a good heavy Pack of some Part of our Cloaths and Bedding
by which Means we kept Pace with him

This Night we lay by a Runside where I found a fine yellow Earth
the same with BruxelsSand which Goldsmiths use to cast withal
giving a good Price in England and other Parts Here is likewise
the true BloodStone and considerable Quantities of FullersEarth
which I took a Proof of by scouring great Spots out of Woollen
and it provd very good

Saturday
As we were on our Road this Morning our Indian shot at a Tyger
that crossd the Way he being a great Distance from us
I believe he did him no Harm because he sat on his Breech afterwards
and lookd upon us I suppose he expected to have had a Spaniel Bitch
that I had with me for his Breakfast who run towards him
but in the Midway stopt her Career and came sneaking back to us
with her Tail betwixt her Legs

We saw in the Path a great many Trees blown up by the Roots
at the Bottom whereof stuck great Quantities of fine red Bole
I believe nothing inferior to that of Venice or Lemma
We found some Holes in the Earth which were full of a Water as black as Ink
I thought that Tincture might proceed from some Mineral
but had not Time to make a farther Discovery About Noon we passd over
a pleasant stony Brook whose Water was of a bluish Cast
as it is for several hundreds of Miles towards the Heads of the Rivers
I suppose occasiond by the vast Quantities of Marble
lying in the Bowels of the Earth The Springs that feed
these Rivulets lick up some Potions of the Stones in the Brooks
which Dissolution gives this Tincture as appears in all
or most of the Rivers and Brooks of this Country whose rapid Streams
are like those in Yorkshire and other Northern Counties of England
The Indians talk of many Sorts of Fish which they afford
but we had not Time to discover their Species

I saw here had been some Indian Plantations formerly
there being several pleasant Fields of cleard Ground and excellent Soil
now well spread with fine bladed Grass and StrawberryVines

The Mould here is excessive rich and a Country very pleasing to the Eye
had it the Convenience of a navigable River as all new Colonies
of Necessity require It would make a delightful Settlement

We went eight Miles farther and came to the Wateree Chickanee Indians
The Land holds good there being not a Spot of bad Land to be seen
in several Days going

The People of this Nation are likely tall Persons and great Pilferers
stealing from us any Thing they could lay their Hands on
though very respectful in giving us what Victuals we wanted
We lay in their Cabins all Night being dark smoaky Holes
as ever I saw any Indians dwell in This Nation is much more populous
than the Congerees and their Neighbours yet understand not
one anothers Speech They are very poor in English Effects
several of them having no Guns making Use of Bows and Arrows
being a lazy idle People a Quality incident to most Indians
but none to that Degree as these as I ever met withal

Their Country is wholly free from Swamps and Quagmires being high dry Land
and consequently healthful producing large CornStalks and fair Grain

Sunday
Next Morning we took off our Beards with a Razor the Indians looking on
with a great deal of Admiration They told us they had never seen
the like before and that our Knives cut far better than those
that came amongst the Indians They would fain have borrowd our Razors
as they had our Knives Scissors and TobaccoTongs the day before
being as ingenious at picking of Pockets as any I believe
the World affords for they will steal with their Feet
Yesterday one of our Company not walking so fast as the rest
was left behind He being out of Sight before we missd him
and not coming up to us tho we staid a considerable time on the Road
for him we stuck up Sticks in the Ground and left other Tokens
to direct him which way we were gone But he came not to us that Night
which gave us Occasion to fear some of the Heathens had killd him
for his Cloaths or the savage Beasts had devourd him in the Wilderness
he having nothing about him to strike Fire withal As we were debating
which way we should send to know what was become of him he overtook us
having a Waxsaw Indian for his Guide He told us he had missd the Path
and got to another Nation of Indians but 3 Miles off who at that time
held great Feasting They had entertaind him very respectfully
and sent that Indian to invite us amongst them wondring that
we would not take up our Quarters with them but make our Abode
with such a poor Sort of Indians that were not capable of entertaining us
according to our Deserts We receivd the Messenger with
a great many Ceremonies acceptable to those sort of Creatures
Bidding our Waterree King adieu we set forth towards the Waxsaws
going along cleard Ground all the Way Upon our Arrival we were led into
a very large and lightsome Cabin the like I have not met withal
They laid Furs and DeerSkins upon Cane Benches for us to sit or lie upon
bringing immediately stewed Peaches and green Corn that is preservd
in their Cabins before it is ripe and sodden and boild when they use it
which is a pretty sort of Food and a great Increaser of the Blood

These Indians are of an extraordinary Stature and calld
by their Neighbours flat Heads which seems a very suitable Name for them
In their Infancy their Nurses lay the Backpart of their Childrens Heads
on a Bag of Sand such as Engravers use to rest their Plates upon
They use a Roll which is placed upon the Babes Forehead
it being laid with its Back on a flat Board and swaddled hard down thereon
from one End of this Engine to the other This Method makes
the Childs Body and Limbs as straight as an Arrow There being
some young Indians that are perhaps crookedly inclind
at their first coming into the World who are made perfectly straight
by this Method I never saw an Indian of a mature Age
that was any ways crooked except by Accident and that way seldom
for they cure and prevent Deformities of the Limbs and Body very exactly
The Instrument I spoke of before being a sort of a Press that is
let out and in more or less according to the Discretion of the Nurse
in which they make the Childs Head flat it makes the Eyes stand
a prodigious Way asunder and the Hair hang over the Forehead
like the Eves of a House which seems very frightful They being askd
the Reason why they practisd this Method replyd the Indians Sight
was much strengthened and quicker thereby to discern the Game in hunting
at larger Distance and so never missd of becoming expert Hunters
the Perfection of which they all aim at as we do to become
experienced Soldiers learned SchoolMen or Artists in Mechanicks
He that is a good Hunter never misses of being a Favourite amongst the Women
the prettiest Girls being always bestowd upon the chiefest SportsMen
and those of a grosser Mould upon the useless Lubbers
Thus they have a Graduation amongst them as well as other Nations
As for the Solemnity of Marriages amongst them kept with so much Ceremony
as divers Authors affirm it never appeard amongst those many Nations
I have been withal any otherwise than in the Manner I have
mentiond hereafter

The Girls at 12 or 13 Years of Age as soon as Nature prompts them
freely bestow their Maidenheads on some Youth about the same Age
continuing her Favours on whom she most affects changing her Mate very often
few or none of them being constant to one till a greater Number of Years
has made her capable of managing domestick Affairs and she hath tryd
the Vigour of most of the Nation she belongs to Multiplicity of Gallants
never being a Stain to a Females Reputation or the least Hindrance
of her Advancement but the more Whorish the more Honourable
and they of all most coveted by those of the first Rank to make a Wife of
The Flos Virginis so much coveted by the Europeans is never valued
by these Savages When a Man and Woman have gone through their Degrees
there being a certain Graduation amongst them and are allowd
to be HouseKeepers which is not till they arrive at such an Age
and have past the Ceremonies practisd by their Nation almost all Kingdoms
differing in the Progress thereof then it is that the Man makes his Addresses
to some one of these thoroughpaced Girls or other whom he likes best
When she is won the Parents of both Parties with Advice of the King
agree about the Matter making a Promise of their Daughter to the Man
that requires her it often happening that they converse and travel together
for several Moons before the Marriage is publishd openly After this
at the least Dislike the Man may turn her away and take another
or if she disapproves of his Company a Price is set upon her
and if the Man that seeks to get her will pay the Fine to her Husband
she becomes free from Him Likewise some of their War Captains
and great Men very often will retain 3 or 4 Girls at a time
for their own Use when at the same time he is so impotent and old
as to be incapable of making Use of one of them so that
he seldom misses of wearing greater Horns than the Game he kills
The Husband is never so enragd as to put his Adulteress to Death if she
is caught in the Fact the Rival becomes Debtor to the cornuted Husband
in a certain Quantity of Trifles valuable amongst them which he pays
as soon as dischargd and then all Animosity is laid aside betwixt
the Husband and his Wifes Gallant The Man proves often so good humourd
as to please his Neighbour and gratify his Wifes Inclinations
by letting her out for a Night or two to the Embraces of some other
which perhaps she has a greater Liking to tho this is
not commonly practisd

They set apart the youngest and prettiest Faces for trading Girls
these are remarkable by their Hair having a particular Tonsure
by which they are known and distinguishd from those engagd to Husbands
They are mercenary and whoever makes Use of them first hires them
the greatest Share of the Gain going to the Kings Purse
who is the chief Bawd exercising his Perogative over all
the Stews of his Nation and his own Cabin very often
being the chiefest BrothelHouse As they grow in Years
the hot Assaults of Love grow cooler and then they commonly are so staid
as to engage themselves with more Constancy to each other
I have seen several Couples amongst them that have been so reservd
as to live together for many Years faithful to each other
admitting none to their Beds but such as they ownd for their Wife or Husband
So continuing to their Lifes end

At our Waxsaw Landlords Cabin was a Woman employd in no other Business
than Cookery it being a House of great Resort The Fire was surrounded
with Roastmeat or Barbakues and the Pots continually boiling
full of Meat from Morning till Night This SheCook was the cleanliest
I ever saw amongst the Heathens of America washing her Hands
before she undertook to do any Cookery and repeated this unusual Decency
very often in a day She made us as WhiteBread as any English
could have done and was full as neat and expeditious in her Affairs
It happend to be one of their great Feasts when we were there
The first day that we came amongst them arrivd an Ambassador
from the King of Sapona to treat with these Indians about
some important Affairs He was painted with Vermillion all over his Face
having a very large Cutlass stuck in his Girdle and a Fusee in his Hand
At Night the Revels began where this Foreign Indian was admitted
the King and War Captain inviting us to see their Masquerade
This Feast was held in Commemoration of the plentiful Harvest of Corn
they had reapd the Summer before with an united Supplication
for the like plentiful Produce the Year ensuing These Revels
are carried on in a House made for that purpose it being done round
with white Benches of fine Canes joining along the Wall
and a place for the Door being left which is so low that a Man
must stoop very much to enter therein This Edifice resembles
a large HayRick its Top being Pyramidal and much bigger
than their other Dwellings and at the Building whereof every one assists
till it is finishd All their DwellingHouses are coverd with Bark
but this differs very much for it is very artificially
thatchd with Sedge and Rushes As soon as finishd they place
some one of their chiefest Men to dwell therein charging him
with the diligent Preservation thereof as a Prince commits
the Charge and Government of a Fort or Castle to some Subject
he thinks worthy of that Trust In these StateHouses is transacted
all Publick and Private Business relating to the Affairs of the Government
as the Audience of Foreign Ambassadors from other Indian Rulers
Consultation of waging and making War Proposals of their Trade
with neighbouring Indians or the English who happen to come
amongst them In this Theater the most Aged and Wisest meet
determining what to Act and what may be most convenient to Omit
Old Age being held in as great Veneration amongst these Heathens
as amongst any People you shall meet withal in any Part of the World

Whensoever an Aged Man is speaking none ever interrupts him
the contrary Practice the English and other Europeans too much use
the Company yielding a great deal of Attention to his Tale
with a continued Silence and an exact Demeanour during the Oration
Indeed the Indians are a People that never interrupt one another
in their Discourse no Man so much as offering to open his Mouth
till the Speaker has utterd his Intent When an EnglishMan
comes amongst them perhaps every one is acquainted with him
yet first the King bids him Welcome after him the WarCaptain
so on gradually from High to Low not one of all these speaking
to the White Guest till his Superiour has ended his Salutation
Amongst Women it seems impossible to find a Scold if they are provokd
or affronted by their Husbands or some other they resent
the Indignity offerd them in silent Tears or by refusing their Meat
Would some of our European Daughters of Thunder set these Indians
for a Pattern there might be more quiet Families found amongst them
occasiond by that unruly Member the Tongue

Festination proceeds from the Devil says a Learned Doctor
a Passion the Indians seem wholly free from they determining
no Business of Moment without a great deal of Deliberation and Wariness
None of their Affairs appear to be attended with Impetuosity or Haste
being more content with the common Accidents incident to humane Nature
as Losses contrary Winds bad Weather and Poverty
than those of more civilized Countries

Now to return to our StateHouse whither we were invited by the Grandees
As soon as we came into it they placd our Englishmen near the King
it being my Fortune to sit next him having his great General
or WarCaptain on my other Hand The House is as dark as a Dungeon
and as hot as one of the DutchStoves in Holland They had made
a circular Fire of split Canes in the middle of the House
It was one Mans Employment to add more split Reeds to the one end
as it consumd at the other there being a small Vacancy left
to supply it with Fewel They brought in great store of Loblolly
and other Medleys made of Indian Grain stewed Peaches
BearVenison c every one bringing some Offering to enlarge the Banquet
according to his Degree and Quality When all the Viands were brought in
the first Figure began with kicking out the Dogs which are seemingly Wolves
made tame with starving and beating they being the worst DogMasters
in the World so that it is an infallible Cure for SoreEyes
ever to see an Indians Dog fat They are of a quite contrary Disposition
to Horses some of their Kings having gotten by great chance
a Jade stolen by some neighbouring Indian and transported
farther into the Country and sold or bought sometimes of a Christian
that trades amongst them These Creatures they continually cram
and feed with Maiz and what the Horse will eat till he is as fat as a Hog
never making any farther use of him than to fetch a Deer home
that is killed somewhere near the Indians Plantation

After the Dogs had fled the Room the Company was summond by Beat of Drum
the Musick being made of a dressd Deers Skin tied hard upon
an Earthen PorridgePot Presently in came fine Men dressd up with Feathers
their Faces being covered with Vizards made of Gourds
round their Ancles and Knees were hung Bells of several sorts
having Wooden Falchions in their Hands such as StageFencers commonly use
in this Dress they danced about an Hour shewing many strange Gestures
and brandishing their Wooden Weapons as if they were going
to fight each other oftentimes walking very nimbly round the Room
without making the least Noise with their Bells a thing I much admired at
again turning their Bodies Arms and Legs into such frightful Postures
that you would have guessd they had been quite raving mad At last
they cut two or three high Capers and left the Room In their stead
came in a parcel of Women and Girls to the Number of Thirty odd
every one taking place according to her Degree of Stature
the tallest leading the Dance and the least of all being placd last
with these they made a circular Dance like a Ring
representing the Shape of the Fire they danced about Many of these
had great HorseBells about their Legs and small Hawks Bells
about their Necks They had Musicians who were two Old Men
one of whom beat a Drum while the other rattled with a Gourd
that had Corn in it to make a Noise withal To these Instruments
they both sung a mournful Ditty the Burthen of their Song was
in Remembrance of their former Greatness and Numbers of their Nation
the famous Exploits of their Renowned Ancestors and all Actions of Moment
that had in former Days been performd by their Forefathers
At these Festivals it is that they give a Traditional Relation of what
hath passd amongst them to the younger Fry These verbal Deliveries
being always publishd in their most Publick Assemblies
serve instead of our Traditional Notes by the use of Letters
Some Indians that I have met withal have given me
a very curious Description of the great Deluge the Immortality of the Soul
with a pithy Account of the Reward of good and wicked Deeds in the Life
to come having found amongst some of them great Observers of Moral Rules
and the Law of Nature indeed a worthy Foundation to build Christianity upon
were a true Method found out and practisd for the Performance thereof

Their way of Dancing is nothing but a sort of stamping Motion
much like the treading upon Founders Bellows This FemaleGang
held their Dance for above six Hours being all of them of a white Lather
like a Running Horse that has just come in from his Race
My Landlady was the Ringleader of the Amazons who when in her own House
behavd herself very discreetly and warily in her Domestick Affairs
yet Custom had so infatuated her as to almost break her Heart
with Dancing amongst such a confused Rabble During this Dancing
the Spectators do not neglect their Business in working the LoblollyPots
and the other Meat that was brought thither more or less of them
being continually Eating whilst the others were Dancing
When the Dancing was ended every Youth that was so disposed
catchd hold of the Girl he liked best and took her that Night
for his BedFellow making as short Courtship and expeditious Weddings
as the FootGuards usd to do with the Trulls in SalisburyCourt

Next we shall treat of the Land hereabouts which is a Marl as red as Blood
and will lather like Soap The Town stands on this Land
which holds considerably farther in the Country and is in my Opinion
so durable that no Labour of Man in one or two Ages could make it poor
I have formerly seen the like in Leicestershire bordering upon Rutland
Here were CornStalks in their Fields as thick as the Small of a Mans Leg
and they are ordinarily to be seen

We lay with these Indians one Night there being by my Bedside
one of the largest Iron Pots I had ever seen in America
which I much wondred at because I thought there might be no navigable Stream
near that Place I askd them where they got that Pot
They laughd at my Demand and would give me no Answer which makes me guess
it came from some Wreck and that we were nearer the Ocean
or some great River than I thought

Monday
The next day about Noon we accidentally met with a Southward Indian
amongst those that usd to trade backwards and forwards
and spoke a little English whom we hird to go with us
to the Esaw Indians a very large Nation containing many thousand People
In the Afternoon we set forward taking our Leaves of the Wisack Indians
and leaving them some Trifles On our Way we met with
several Towns of Indians each Town having its Theater or State House
such Houses being found all along the Road till you come to Sapona
and then no more of those Buildings it being about 170 Miles
We reachd 10 Miles this day lying at another Town of the Wisacks
The Man of the House offerd us Skins to sell but they were too heavy Burdens
for our long Voyage

Tuesday
Next Morning we set out early breaking the Ice we met withal
in the stony Runs which were many We passd by several Cottages
and about 8 of the Clock came to a pretty big Town
where we took up our Quarters in one of their State Houses
the Men being all out hunting in the Woods and none but Women at home
Our Fellow Traveller of whom I spoke before at the Congerees
having a great Mind for an Indian Lass for his BedFellow that Night
spoke to our Guide who soon got a Couple reserving one for himself
That which fell to our Companions Share was a pretty young Girl
Tho they could not understand one Word of what each other spoke
yet the Female Indian being no Novice at her Game but understanding
what she came thither for acted her Part dexterously enough with her Cully
to make him sensible of what she wanted which was to pay the Hire
before he rode the Hackney He shewd her all the Treasure
he was possessd of as Beads Red Cadis c which she likd very well
and permitted him to put them into his Pocket again endearing him
with all the Charms which one of a better Education than Dame Nature
had bestowd upon her could have made use of to render her Consort
a surer Captive After they had usd this Sort of Courtship a small time
the Match was confirmd by both Parties with the Approbation
of as many Indian Women as came to the House to celebrate
our WinchesterWedding Every one of the BrideMaids were as great Whores
as Mrs Bride tho not quite so handsome Our happy Couple
went to Bed together before us all and with as little Blushing
as if they had been Man and Wife for 7 Years The rest of the Company
being weary with travelling had more Mind to take their Rest
than add more Weddings to that hopeful one already consummated
so that tho the other Virgins offerd their Service to us
we gave them their Answer and went to sleep About an Hour before day
I awakd and saw somebody walking up and down the Room
in a seemingly deep Melancholy I calld out to know who it was
and it provd to be Mr Bridegroom who in less than 12 Hours was Batchelor
Husband and Widdower his dear Spouse having pickd his Pocket of the Beads
Cadis and what else should have gratified the Indians
for the Victuals we receivd of them However that did not serve her turn
but she had also got his Shooes away which he had made the Night before
of a drest BuckSkin Thus dearly did our Spark already repent
his new Bargain walking barefoot in his Penitentials
like some poor Pilgrim to Loretto

After the Indians had laughd their Sides sore at the Figure
Mr Bridegroom made with much ado we musterd up another Pair of Shooes
or Moggisons and set forward on our intended Voyage
the Company all the way lifting up their Prayers for the new married Couple
whose Wedding had made away with that which should have purchasd our Food

Wednesday
Relying wholly on Providence we marchd on now and then paying our Respects
to the newmarried Man The Land held rich and good
in many Places there were great Quantities of Marble
The Water was still of a wheyish Colour About 10 of the Clock
we waded thro a River about the Bigness of Derwent in Yorkshire
which I take to be one of the Branches of Winjaw River
We saw several Flocks of Pigeons FieldFares and Thrushes
much like those of Europe The Indians of these Parts
use Sweating very much If any Pain seize their Limbs or Body
immediately they take Reeds or small Wands and bend them UmbrellaFashion
covering them with Skins and Matchcoats They have a large Fire not far off
wherein they heat Stones or where they are wanting Bark
putting it into this Stove which casts an extraordinary Heat
There is a Pot of Water in the Bagnio in which is put a Bunch of an Herb
bearing a Silver Tassel not much unlike the Aurea Virga
With this Vegetable they rub the Head Temples and other Parts
which is reckond a Preserver of the Sight and Strengthener of the Brain
We went this day about 12 Miles one of our Company being
lame of his Knee We passd over an exceeding rich Tract of Land
affording Plenty of great free Stones and marble Rocks
and abounding in many pleasant and delightsome Rivulets
At Noon we stayd and refreshd ourselves at a Cabin
where we met with one of their WarCaptains a Man of great Esteem among them
At his Departure from the Cabin the Man of the House
scratchd this WarCaptain on the Shoulder which is lookd upon
as a very great Compliment among them The Captain went two or three Miles
on our way with us to direct us in our Path One of our Company
gave him a Belt which he took very kindly bidding us call at his House
which was in our Road and stay till the lame Traveller was well
and speaking to the Indian to order his Servant to make us welcome
Thus we parted he being on his Journey to the Congerees
and Savannas a famous warlike friendly Nation of Indians
living to the SouthEnd of Ashly River He had a ManSlave with him
who was loaded with European Goods his Wife and Daughter being in Company
He told us at his Departure that James had sent Knots
to all the Indians thereabouts for every Town to send in 10 Skins
meaning Captain Moor then Governour of SouthCarolina
The Towns being very thick hereabouts at Night we took up our Quarters
at one of the chief Mens Houses which was one of the Theaters
I spoke of before There ran hardby this Town a pleasant River
not very large but as the Indians told us well stord with Fish
We being now among the powerful Nation of Esaws our Landlord entertaind us
very courteously shewing us that Night a pair of LeatherGloves
which he had made and comparing them with ours they provd to be
very ingeniously done considering it was the first Tryal

Thursday
In the Morning he desired to see the lame Mans affected Part
to the end he might do something which he believd would give him Ease
After he had viewed it accordingly he pulld out an Instrument
somewhat like a Comb which was made of a split Reed
with 15 Teeth of RattleSnakes set at much the same distance
as in a large HornComb With these he scratchd the place
where the Lameness chiefly lay till the Blood came bathing it
both before and after Incision with warm Water spurted out of his Mouth
This done he ran into his Plantation and got some Sassafras Root
which grows here in great plenty dryd it in the Embers
scrapd off the outward Rind and having beat it betwixt two Stones
applyd it to the Part afflicted binding it up well Thus in a day or two
the Patient became sound This day we passd through a great many Towns
and Settlements that belong to the SugereeIndians no barren Land
being found amongst them but great plenty of FreeStone and good Timber
About three in the Afternoon we reachd the Kadapau Kings House
where we met with one John Stewart a Scot then an Inhabitant
of JamesRiver in Virginia who had traded there for many Years
Being alone and hearing that the Sinnagers Indians from Canada
were abroad in that Country he durst not venture homewards
till he saw us having heard that we were coming above 20 days before
It is very odd that News should fly so swiftly among these People
Mr Stewart had left Virginia ever since the October before
and had lost a day of the Week of which we informd him He had brought
seven Horses along with him loaded with English Goods for the Indians
and having sold most of his Cargo told us if we would stay two Nights
he would go along with us Company being very acceptable
we accepted the Proposal

Friday
The next day we were preparing for our Voyage and baked some Bread
to take along with us Our Landlord was King of the Kadapau Indians
and always kept two or three trading Girls in his Cabin
Offering one of these to some of our Company who refusd his Kindness
his Majesty flew into a violent Passion to be thus slighted
telling the Englishmen they were good for nothing Our old Gamester
particularly hung his Ears at the Proposal having too lately been a Loser
by that sort of Merchandize It was observable that we did not see
one Partridge from the Waterrees to this place tho my SpanielBitch
which I had with me in this Voyage had put up a great many before

Saturday
On Saturday Morning we all set out for Sapona killing in these Creeks
several Ducks of a strange Kind having a red Circle about their Eyes
like some Pigeons that I have seen a Topknot reaching
from the Crown of their Heads almost to the middle of their Backs
and abundance of Feathers of pretty Shades and Colours
They provd excellent Meat Likewise here is good store of Woodcocks
not so big as those in England the Feathers of the Breast
being of a CarnationColour exceeding ours for Delicacy of Food
The Marble here is of different Colours some or other of the Rocks
representing most Mixtures but chiefly the white having black and blue Veins
in it and some that are red This day we met with seven heaps of Stones
being the Monuments of seven Indians that were slain in that place
by the Sinnagers or Iroquois Our Indian Guide added a Stone
to each heap We took up our Lodgings near a Brookside
where the Virginia Mans Horses got away and went back to the Kadapaus

Sunday
This day one of our Company with a Sapona Indian who attended Stewart
went back for the Horses In the mean time we went to shoot Pigeons
which were so numerous in these Parts that you might see many Millions
in a Flock they sometimes split off the Limbs of stout Oaks and other Trees
upon which they roost o Nights You may find several Indian Towns
of not above 17 Houses that have more than 100 Gallons of Pigeons Oil
or Fat they using it with Pulse or Bread as we do Butter
and making the Ground as white as a Sheet with their Dung
The Indians take a Light and go among them in the Night
and bring away some thousands killing them with long Poles
as they roost in the Trees At this time of the Year the Flocks
as they pass by in great measure obstruct the Light of the day

Monday
On Monday we went about 25 Miles travelling through a pleasant
dry Country and took up our Lodgings by a Hillside that was one entire Rock
out of which gushd out pleasant Fountains of welltasted Water

Tuesday
The next day still passing along such Land as we had done
for many days before which was Hills and Vallies about 10 a Clock
we reachd the Top of one of these Mountains which yielded us
a fine Prospect of a very level Country holding so on all sides
farther than we could discern When we came to travel through it
we found it very stiff and rich being a sort of Marl
This Valley afforded as large Timber as any I ever met withal
especially of ChesnutOaks which render it an excellent Country
for raising great Herds of Swine Indeed were it cultivated
we might have good hopes of as pleasant and fertile a Valley
as any our English in America can afford At Night we lay by
a swift Current where we saw plenty of Turkies but pearchd upon
such lofty Oaks that our Guns would not kill them tho we shot very often
and our Guns were very good Some of our Company shot several times
at one Turkey before he would fly away the Pieces being loaded
with large Gooseshot

Wednesday
Next Morning we got our Breakfasts roasted Acorns being one of the Dishes
The Indians beat them into Meal and thicken their VenisonBroth with them
and oftentimes make a palatable Soop They are used instead of Bread
boiling them till the Oil swims on the top of the Water
which they preserve for use eating the Acorns with Fleshmeat
We travelld this day about 25 Miles over pleasant Savanna Ground
high and dry having very few Trees upon it and those standing
at a great distance The Land was very good and free from
Grubs or Underwood A Man near Sapona may more easily clear
10 Acres of Ground than in some places he can one there being
much loose Stone upon the Land lying very convenient for making of dry Walls
or any other sort of durable Fence This Country abounds likewise
with curious bold Creeks navigable for small Craft disgorging themselves
into the main Rivers that vent themselves into the Ocean
These Creeks are well stord with sundry sorts of Fish and Fowl
and are very convenient for the Transportation of what Commodities
this Place may produce This Night we had a great deal of Rain
with Thunder and Lightning

Thursday
Next Morning it proving delicate Weather three of us separated ourselves
from the Horses and the rest of the Company and went directly
for Sapona Town That day we passd through a delicious Country
none that I ever saw exceeds it We saw fine bladed Grass six Foot high
along the Banks of these pleasant Rivulets We passd by
the Sepulchres of several slain Indians Coming that day about 30 Miles
we reachd the fertile and pleasant Banks of Sapona River
whereon stands the Indian Town and Fort Nor could all Europe
afford a pleasanter Stream were it inhabited by Christians
and cultivated by ingenious Hands These Indians live
in a clear Field about a Mile square which they would have sold me
because I talked sometimes of coming into those Parts to live
This most pleasant River may be something broader than the Thames
at Kingston keeping a continual pleasant warbling Noise
with its reverberating on the bright Marble Rocks It is beautified
with a numerous Train of Swans and other sorts of WaterFowl
not common though extraordinary pleasing to the Eye The forward Spring
welcomd us with her innumerable Train of small Choristers
which inhabit those fair Banks the Hills redoubling and adding Sweetness
to their melodious Tunes by their shrill Echoes One side of the River
is hemmd in with mountainy Ground the other side proving as rich a Soil
to the Eye of a knowing Person with us as any this Western World can afford
We took up our Quarters at the Kings Cabin who was a good Friend
to the English and had lost one of his Eyes in their Vindication
Being upon his march towards the Appallatche Mountains
amongst a Nation of Indians in their Way there happend a Difference
while they were measuring of Gunpowder and the Powder by accident
taking fire blew out one of this Kings Eyes and did a great deal
more mischief upon the spot Yet this Sapona King stood firmly
to the English Mans Interest with whom he was in Company
still siding with him against the Indians They were intended for
the South Sea but were too much fatigued by the vast Ridge of Mountains
tho they hit the right Passage it being no less than five days Journey
through a Ledge of Rocky Hills and sandy Desarts And which is yet worse
there is no Water nor scarce a Bird to be seen during your Passage
over these barren Crags and Valleys The Sapona River proves to be
the West Branch of CapeFair or Clarendon River whose Inlet
with other Advantages makes it appear as noble a River to plant a Colony in
as any I have met withal

The Saponas had about 10 days before we came thither taken
Five Prisoners of the Sinnagers or Jennitos a Sort of People that range
several thousands of Miles making all Prey they lay their Hands on
These are feard by all the savage Nations I ever was among
the Westward Indians dreading their Approach They are all forted in
and keep continual Spies and OutGuards for their better Security
Those Captives they did intend to burn few Prisoners of War
escaping that Punishment The Fire of PitchPine being got ready
and a Feast appointed which is solemnly kept at the time of their acting
this Tragedy the Sufferer has his Body stuck thick with LightWoodSplinters
which are lighted like so many Candles the torturd Person dancing round
a great Fire till his Strength fails and disables him from making them
any farther Pastime Most commonly these Wretches behave themselves
in the Midst of their Tortures with a great deal of Bravery and Resolution
esteeming it Satisfaction enough to be assurd that the same Fate will befal
some of their Tormentors whensoever they fall into the Hands of their Nation
More of this you will have in the other Sheets

The Toteros a neighbouring Nation came down from the Westward Mountains
to the Saponas desiring them to give them those Prisoners into their Hands
to the Intent they might send them back into their own Nation
being bound in Gratitude to be serviceable to the Sinnagers
since not long ago those NorthernIndians had taken
some of the Toteros Prisoners and done them no Harm
but treated them civilly whilst among them sending them
with Safety back to their own People and affirming
that it would be the best Method to preserve Peace on all Sides
At that time these Toteros Saponas and the Keyauwees
3 small Nations were going to live together by which they thought
they should strengthen themselves and become formidable to their Enemies
The Reasons offerd by the Toteros being heard the Sapona King
with the Consent of his Counsellors deliverd the Sinnagers up
to the Toteros to conduct them home

Friday
Friday Morning the old King having shewd us 2 of his Horses
that were as fat as if they had belongd to the Dutch Troopers
left us and went to look after his BeverTraps there being
abundance of those amphibious Animals in this River and the Creeks adjoining
Taken with the Pleasantness of the Place we walkd along the Riverside
where we found a very delightful Island made by the River and a Branch
there being several such Plots of Ground environd with this Silver Stream
which are fit Pastures for Sheep and free from any offensive Vermin
Nor can any thing be desired by a contented Mind as to a pleasant Situation
but what may here be found Every Step presenting some new Object
which still adds Invitation to the Traveller in these Parts
Our Indian King and his Wife entertaind us very respectfully

Saturday Jan 31
On Saturday the Indians brought in some Swans and Geese
which we had our Share of One of their Doctors took me to his Cabin
and shewd me a great Quantity of medicinal Drugs the Produce of those Parts
Relating their Qualities as to the Emunctories they workd by
and what great Maladies he had heald by them This Evening
came to us the Horses with the Remainder of our Company their Indian Guide
who was a Youth of this Nation having killd in their Way a very fat Doe
Part of which they brought to us

Sunday
This day the King sent out all his able Hunters to kill Game
for a great Feast that was to be kept at their Departure from the Town
which they offerd to sell me for a small matter That Piece of Ground
with a little Trouble would make an Englishman a most curious Settlement
containing above a Mile square of rich Land This Evening
came down some Toteros tall likely Men having great Plenty of Buffelos
Elks and Bears with other sort of Deer amongst them
which strong Food makes large robust Bodies Enquiring of them
if they never got any of the Bezoar Stone and giving them a Description
how it was found the Indians told me they had great plenty of it
and askd me What use I could make of it I answerd them
That the white Men usd it in Physick and that I would buy some of them
if they would get it against I came that way again Thereupon one of them
pulld out a LeatherPouch wherein was some of it in Powder
he was a notable Hunter and affirmd to me That that Powder
blown into the Eyes strengthend the Sight and Brain exceedingly
that being the most common Use they made of it I bought for 2 or 3 Flints
a large PeachLoaf made up with a pleasant sort of Seed
and this did us a singular Kindness in our Journey Near the Town
within their cleard Land are several Bagnios or SweatingHouses
made of Stone in Shape like a large Oven These they make much Use of
especially for any Pains in the Joints got by Cold or Travelling
At Night as we lay in our Beds there arose the most violent NW Wind
I ever knew The first Puff blew down all the Palisadoes that fortifyd
the Town and I thought it would have blown us all into the River
together with the Houses Our oneeyd King who pretends much
to the Art of Conjuration ran out in the most violent Hurry
and in the Middle of the Town fell to his Necromantick Practice
tho I thought he would have been blown away or killd
before the Devil and he could have exchangd half a dozen Words
but in two Minutes the Wind was ceasd and it became as great a Calm
as ever I knew in my Life As I much admird at that sudden Alteration
the old Man told me the Devil was very angry and had done thus
because they had not put the Sinnagers to Death

Monday
On Monday Morning our whole Company with the Horses
set out from the SaponaIndian Town after having seen some of the Locust
which is gotten thereabouts the same Sort that bears Honey
Going over several Creeks very convenient for WaterMills
about 8 Miles from the Town we passd over a very pretty River
calld Rocky River a fit Name having a Ridge of high Mountains running
from its Banks to the Eastward and disgorging itself into SaponaRiver
so that there is a most pleasant and convenient Neck of Land
betwixt both Rivers lying upon a Point where many thousand Acres
may be fenced in without much Cost or Labour You can scarce go a Mile
without meeting with one of these small swift Currents
here being no Swamps to be found but pleasant dry Roads
all over the Country The Way that we went this day was as full of Stones
as any which Craven in the West of Yorkshire could afford
and having nothing but Moggisons on my Feet I was so lamd
by this stony Way that I thought I must have taken up some Stay
in those Parts We went this day not above 15 or 20 Miles
After we had suppd and all lay down to sleep there came a Wolf
close to the Fireside where we lay My Spaniel soon discoverd him
at which one of our Company fird a Gun at the Beast but I believe
there was a Mistake in the loading of it for it did him no Harm
The Wolf stayd till he had almost loaded again but the Bitch making
a great Noise at last left us and went aside We had no sooner laid down
but he approachd us again yet was more shy so that we could not get
a Shot at him

Tuesday
Next day we had 15 Miles farther to the Keyauwees The Land
is more mountainous but extremely pleasant and an excellent Place
for the breeding Sheep Goats and Horses or Mules if the English
were once brought to the Experience of the Usefulness of those Creatures
The Valleys are here very rich At Noon we passd over
such another stony River as that eight Miles from Sapona
This is calld Heighwaree and affords as good blue Stone for MillStones
as that from Cologn good Rags some Hones and large Pebbles
in great abundance besides FreeStone of several Sorts all very useful
I knew one of these Hones made use of by an Acquaintance of mine
and it provd rather better than any from Old Spain or elsewhere
The Veins of Marble are very large and curious on this River
and the Banks thereof

Five Miles from this River to the NW stands the Keyauwees Town
They are fortifyd in with wooden Puncheons like Sapona
being a People much of the same Number Nature hath so fortifyd this Town
with Mountains that were it a Seat of War it might easily
be made impregnable having large CornFields joining to their Cabins
and a Savanna near the Town at the Foot of these Mountains
that is capable of keeping some hundred Heads of Cattle And all this
environd round with very high Mountains so that no hard Wind ever troubles
these Inhabitants Those high Clifts have no Grass growing on them
and very few Trees which are very short and stand at a great Distance
one from another The Earth is of a red Colour and seems to me
to be wholly designd by Nature for the Production of Minerals
being of too hot a Quality to suffer any Verdure upon its Surface
These Indians make use of LeadOre to paint their Faces withal
which they get in the neighbouring Mountains As for the refining of Metals
the Indians are wholly ignorant of it being content with the Realgar
But if it be my Chance once more to visit these Hilly Parts
I shall make a longer Stay amongst them For were a good Vein of Lead
found out and workd by an ingenious Hand it might be of no small Advantage
to the Undertaker there being great Convenience for smelting
either by Bellows or Reverberation and the Working of these Mines
might discover some that are much richer

At the Top of one of these Mountains is a Cave that 100 Men
may fit very conveniently to dine in whether natural or artificial
I could not learn There is a fine Bole between this Place and the Saps
These Valleys thus hemmd in with Mountains would doubtless prove
a good place for propagating some sort of Fruits that our Easterly Winds
commonly blast The Vine could not miss of thriving well here
but we of the Northern Climate are neither Artists nor curious
in propagating that pleasant and profitable Vegetable Near the Town
is such another Current as Heighwaree We being six in Company
divided ourselves into Two Parties and it was my Lot to be
at the House of Keyauwees Jack who is King of that People
He is a CongereeIndian and ran away when he was a Boy
He got this Government by Marriage with the Queen the Female Issue
carrying the Heritage for fear of Impostors the Savages
well knowing how much Frailty possesses the Indian Women
betwixt the Garters and the Girdle

Wednesday
The next day having some occasion to write the Indian King who saw me
believd that he could write as well as I Whereupon I wrote a Word
and gave it him to copy which he did with more Exactness
than any European could have done that was illiterate It was so well
that he who could read mine might have done the same by his
Afterwards he took great Delight in making Fishhooks of his own Invention
which would have been a good Piece for an Antiquary to have puzzled
his Brains withal in tracing out the Characters of all the Oriental Tongues
He sent for several Indians to his Cabin to look at his Handywork
and both he and they thought I could read his Writing
as well as I could my own I had a Manual in my Pocket
that had King Davids Picture in it in one of his private Retirements
The Indian askd me Who that Figure represented I told him
It was the Picture of a good King that livd according to
the Rules of Morality doing to all as he would be done by
ordering all his Life to the Service of the Creator of all things
and being now above us all in Heaven with God Almighty
who had rewarded him with all the delightful Pleasures imaginable
in the other World for his Obedience to him in this I concluded
with telling them that we received nothing here below
as Food Raiment c but what came from that Omnipotent Being
They listened to my Discourse with a profound Silence assuring me
that they believd what I said to be true No Man living will ever be able
to make these Heathens sensible of the Happiness of a future State
except he now and then mentions some lively carnal Representation
which may quicken their Apprehensions and make them thirst
after such a gainful Exchange for were the best Lecture
that ever was preachd by Man given to an ignorant sort of People
in a more learned Style than their mean Capacities are able to understand
the Intent would prove ineffectual and the Hearers would be left
in a greater Labyrinth than their Teacher found them in
But dispense the Precepts of our Faith according to the Pupils Capacity
and there is nothing in our Religion but what an indifferent Reason is
in some measure able to comprehend tho a NewEngland Minister
blames the French Jesuits for this way of Proceeding as being
quite contrary to a true Christian Practice and affirms it to be no ready
or true Method to establish a lively Representation of our Christian Belief
amongst these Infidels

All the Indians hereabouts carefully preserve the Bones of the Flesh
they eat and burn them as being of Opinion that if they omitted
that Custom the Game would leave their Country and they should not be able
to maintain themselves by their Hunting Most of these Indians
wear Mustachoes or Whiskers which is rare by reason the Indians
are a People that commonly pull the Hair of their Faces and other Parts
up by the Roots and suffer none to grow Here is plenty of Chesnuts
which are rarely found in Carolina and never near the Sea or SaltWater
tho they are frequently in such Places in Virginia

At the other House where our FellowTravellers lay they had provided a Dish
in great Fashion amongst the Indians which was Two young Fawns
taken out of the Does Bellies and boild in the same slimy Bags
Nature had placd them in and one of the CountryHares
stewd with the Guts in her Belly and her Skin with the Hair on
This newfashiond Cookery wrought Abstinence in our FellowTravellers
which I somewhat wonderd at because one of them made nothing
of eating Allegators as heartily as if it had been Pork and Turneps
The Indians dress most things after the Woodcock Fashion
never taking the Guts out At the House we lay at there was
very good Entertainment of Venison Turkies and Bears and which is customary
amongst the Indians the Queen had a Daughter by a former Husband
who was the beautifullest Indian I ever saw and had an Air of Majesty
with her quite contrary to the general Carriage of the Indians
She was very kind to the English during our Abode as well as
her Father and Mother

Thursday
This Morning most of our Company having some Inclination
to go straight away for Virginia when they left this Place
I and one more took our leaves of them resolving with Gods Leave
to see NorthCarolina one of the Indians setting us in our way
The rest being indifferent which way they went desired us by all means
to leave a Letter for them at the AchonechyTown The Indian
that put us in our Path had been a Prisoner amongst the Sinnagers
but had outrun them although they had cut his Toes and half his Feet away
which is a Practice common amongst them They first raise the Skin
then cut away half the Feet and so wrap the Skin over the Stumps
and make a present Cure of the Wounds This commonly disables them
from making their Escape they being not so good Travellers as before
and the Impression of their HalfFeet making it easy to trace them
However this Fellow was got clear of them but had little Heart
to go far from home and carryd always a Case of Pistols in his Girdle
besides a Cutlass and a Fuzee Leaving the rest of our Company
at the IndianTown we travelld that day about 20 Miles
in very cold frosty Weather and passd over two pretty Rivers
something bigger than Heighwaree but not quite so stony We took
these two Rivers to make one of the Northward Branches of CapeFair River
but afterwards found our Mistake

Friday
The next day we travelld over very good Land but full of FreeStone
and Marble which pinchd our Feet severely We took up our Quarters
in a sort of SavannaGround that had very few Trees in it
The Land was good and had several Quarries of Stone but not loose
as the others usd to be

Saturday
Next Morning we got our Breakfasts of Parchd Corn having nothing but that
to subsist on for above 100 Miles All the PineTrees were vanishd
for we had seen none for two days We passd through a delicate rich Soil
this day no great Hills but pretty Risings and Levels which made
a beautiful Country We likewise passd over three Rivers this day
the first about the bigness of Rocky River the other not much differing
in Size Then we made not the least Question but we had passd over
the NorthWest Branch of CapeFair travelling that day above 30 Miles
We were much taken with the Fertility and Pleasantness of the Neck of Land
between these two Branches and no less pleasd that we had passd the River
which usd to frighten Passengers from fording it At last
determining to rest on the other side of a Hill which we saw before us
when we were on the Top thereof there appeard to us such another delicious
rapid Stream as that of Sapona having large Stones
about the bigness of an ordinary House lying up and down the River
As the Wind blew very cold at NW and we were very weary and hungry
the Swiftness of the Current gave us some cause to fear but at last
we concluded to venture over that Night Accordingly we strippd
and with great Difficulty by Gods Assistance got safe
to the Northside of the famous HauRiver by some called Reatkin
the Indians differing in the Names of Places according to their
several Nations It is calld HauRiver from the Sissipahau Indians
who dwell upon this Stream which is one of the main Branches of CapeFair
there being rich Land enough to contain some Thousands of Families
for which Reason I hope in a short time it will be planted
This River is much such another as Sapona both seeming to run a vast way
up the Country Here is plenty of good Timber and especially
of a Scalybarkd Oak And as there is Stone enough in both Rivers
and the Land is extraordinary Rich no Man that will be content
within the Bounds of Reason can have any grounds to dislike it
And they that are otherwise are the best Neighbours when farthest of

Sunday
As soon as it was day we set out for the AchonechyTown
it being by Estimation 20 Miles off which I believe is pretty exact
We were got about half way meeting great Gangs of Turkies when we saw
at a Distance 30 loaded Horses coming on the Road with four or five Men
on other Jades driving them We chargd our Piece and went up to them
Enquiring whence they came from They told us from Virginia
The leading Mans Name was Massey who was born about Leeds
in Yorkshire He askd from whence we came We told him
Then he askd again Whether we wanted any thing that he had telling us
we should be welcome to it We accepted of Two Wheaten Biskets
and a little Ammunition He advised us by all means
to strike down the Country for Ronoack and not think of Virginia
because of the Sinnagers of whom they were afraid tho so well armd
and numerous They persuaded us also to call upon one Enoe Will
as we went to Adshusheer for that he would conduct us safe
among the English giving him the Character of a very faithful Indian
which we afterwards found true by Experience The VirginiaMen
asking our Opinion of the Country we were then in we told them
it was a very pleasant one They were all of the same Opinion and affirmd
That they had never seen 20 Miles of such extraordinary rich Land
lying all together like that betwixt HauRiver and the Achonechy Town
Having taken our Leaves of each other we set forward and the Country
thro which we passd was so delightful that it gave us
a great deal of Satisfaction About Three a Clock we reachd the Town
and the Indians presently brought us good fat Bear and Venison
which was very acceptable at that time Their Cabins were hung
with a good sort of Tapestry as fat Bear and barbakued or dried Venison
no Indians having greater Plenty of Provisions than these
The Savages do indeed still possess the Flower of Carolina
the English enjoying only the Fagend of that fine Country
We had not been in the Town 2 Hours when EnoeWill came into
the Kings Cabin which was our Quarters We askd him
if he would conduct us to the English and what he would have for his Pains
he answerd he would go along with us and for what he was to have
he left that to our Discretion

Monday
The next Morning we set out with EnoeWill towards Adshusheer
leaving the Virginia Path and striking more to the Eastward
for Ronoack Several Indians were in our Company belonging
to Wills Nation who are the Shoccories mixt with the EnoeIndians
and those of the Nation of Adshusheer EnoeWill is their chief Man
and rules as far as the Banks of Reatkin It was a sad stony Way
to Adshusheer We went over a small River by Achonechy
and in this 14 Miles through several other Streams which empty themselves
into the Branches of CapeFair The stony Way made me quite lame
so that I was an Hour or two behind the rest but honest Will
would not leave me but bid me welcome when we came to his House
feasting us with hot Bread and BearsOil which is wholsome Food
for Travellers There runs a pretty Rivulet by this Town
Near the Plantation I saw a prodigious overgrown PineTree
having not seen any of that Sort of Timber for above 125 Miles
They brought us 2 Cocks and pulld their larger Feathers off
never plucking the lesser but singeing them off I took one of these Fowls
in my Hand to make it cleaner than the Indian had pulling out
his Guts and Liver which I laid in a Bason notwithstanding which
he kept such a Struggling for a considerable time that I had much ado
to hold him in my Hands The Indians laughd at me and told me
that EnoeWill had taken a Cock of an Indian that was not at home
and the Fowl was designd for another Use I conjecturd
that he was designd for an Offering to their God who they say
hurts them which is the Devil In this Struggling he bled afresh
and there issued out of his Body more Blood than commonly
such Creatures afford Notwithstanding all this we cookd him and eat him
and if he was designd for him cheated the Devil The Indians keep
many Cocks but seldom above one Hen using very often such wicked Sacrifices
as I mistrusted this Fowl was designd for

Our Guide and Landlord EnoeWill was of the best and most agreeable Temper
that ever I met with in an Indian being always ready
to serve the English not out of Gain but real Affection
which makes him apprehensive of being poisond by some wicked Indians
and was therefore very earnest with me to promise him to revenge his Death
if it should so happen He brought some of his chief Men into his Cabin
and 2 of them having a Drum and a Rattle sung by us as we lay in Bed
and struck up their Musick to serenade and welcome us to their Town
And tho at last we fell asleep yet they continud their Consort
till Morning These Indians are fortifyd in as the former
and are much addicted to a Sport they call Chenco which is carryd on
with a Staff and a Bowl made of Stone which they trundle upon a smooth Place
like a BowlingGreen made for that Purpose as I have mentiond before

Tuesday
Next Morning we set out with our Guide and several other Indians
who intended to go to the English and buy Rum We designd for a Nation
about 40 Miles from Adshusheer calld the Lower Quarter
The first Night we lay in a rich Perkoson or low Ground
that was hardby a Creek and good dry Land

Wednesday
The next day we went over several Tracts of rich Land
but mixd with Pines and other indifferent Soil In our way
there stood a great Stone about the Size of a large Oven and hollow
this the Indians took great Notice of putting some Tobacco
into the Concavity and spitting after it I askd them
the Reason of their so doing but they made me no Answer In the Evening
we passd over a pleasant Rivulet with a fine gravelly Bottom
having come over such another that Morning On the other side of this River
we found the Indian Town which was a Parcel of nasty smoaky Holes
much like the Waterrees their Town having a great Swamp
running directly through the Middle thereof The Land here
begins to abate of its Height and has some few Swamps
Most of these Indians have but one Eye but what Mischance or Quarrel
has bereavd them of the other I could not learn They were not
so free to us as most of the other Indians had been Victuals being
somewhat scarce among them However we got enough to satisfy our Appetites
I saw among these Men very long Arrows headed with Pieces of Glass
which they had broken from Bottles They had shapd them neatly
like the Head of a Dart but which way they did it I cant tell
We had not been at this Town above an Hour when two of our Company
that had bought a Mare of John Stewart came up to us
having receivd a Letter by one of Wills Indians who was very cautious
and asked a great many Questions to certifie him of the Person
eer he would deliver the Letter They had left the Trader
and one that came from SouthCarolina with us to go to Virginia
these Two being resolved to go to Carolina with us

Thursday
This Day fell much Rain so we staid at the Indian Town

Friday
This Morning we set out early being four EnglishMen
besides several Indians We went 10 Miles and were then stoppd
by the Freshes of EnoeRiver which had raisd it so high
that we could not pass over till it was fallen I enquird of my Guide
Where this River disgorgd it self He said It was EnoeRiver
and run into a Place calld EnoeBay near his Country which he left
when he was a Boy by which I perceivd he was one of the Cores by Birth
This being a Branch of NeusRiver

Saturday
This Day our FellowTravellers Mare ran away from him
wherefore Will went back as far as the lower Quarter and brought her back

Sunday
The next Day early came two Tuskeruro Indians to the other side
of the River but could not get over They talkd much to us
but we understood them not In the Afternoon Will came
with the Mare and had some Discourse with them they told him
The English to whom he was going were very wicked People
and That they threatned the Indians for Hunting near their Plantations
These Two Fellows were going among the Schoccores and Achonechy Indians
to sell their Wooden Bowls and Ladles for RawSkins which they make
great Advantage of hating that any of these Westward Indians
should have any Commerce with the English which would prove a Hinderance
to their Gains Their Stories deterrd an Old Indian and his Son
from going any farther but Will told us Nothing they had said
should frighten him he believing them to be a couple of Hogstealers
and that the English only sought Restitution of their Losses by them
and that this was the only ground for their Report Will had a Slave
a SissipahauIndian by Nation who killed us several Turkies
and other Game on which we feasted

Monday
This River is near as large as Reatkin the Southside having
curious Tracts of good Land the Banks high and StoneQuarries
The Tuskeruros being come to us we venturd over the River
which we found to be a strong Current and the Water about Breasthigh
However we all got safe to the NorthShore which is but poor
white sandy Land and bears no Timber but small shrubby Oaks
We went about 10 Miles and sat down at the Falls of a large Creek
where lay mighty Rocks the Water making a strange Noise
as if a great many WaterMills were going at once I take this to be
the Falls of NeusCreek called by the Indians Wee quo Whom
We lay here all Night My Guide Will desiring to see the Book
that I had about me I lent it him and as he soon found
the Picture of King David he asked me several Questions
concerning the Book and Picture which I resolvd him and invited him
to become a Christian He made me a very sharp Reply assuring me
That he lovd the English extraordinary well and did believe their Ways
to be very good for those that had already practisd them
and had been brought up therein But as for himself he was too much in Years
to think of a Change esteeming it not proper for Old People
to admit of such an Alteration However he told me
If I would take his Son Jack who was then about 14 Years of Age
and teach him to talk in that Book and make Paper speak
which they call our Way of Writing he would wholly resign him to my Tuition
telling me he was of Opinion I was very well affected to the Indians

Tuesday
The next Morning we set out early and I perceivd that these Indians
were in some fear of Enemies for they had an Old Man with them
who was very cunning and circumspect wheresoever he saw any Marks of Footing
or of any Fire that had been made going out of his Way very often
to look for these Marks We went this day above 30 Miles
over a very level Country and most Pine Land yet intermixd
with some Quantities of Marble a good Range for Cattel
though very indifferent for Swine We had now lost our rapid Streams
and were come to slow dead Waters of a brown Colour
proceeding from the Swamps much like the Sluices in Holland
where the TrackScoots go along In the Afternoon we met two Tuskeruros
who told us That there was a Company of Hunters not far of
and if we walkd stoutly we might reach them that Night
But Will and He that ownd the Mare being gone before
and the Old Indian tired we rested that Night in the Woods
making a good light Fire Wood being very plentiful in these Parts

Wednesday
Next Day about 10 a Clock we struck out of the Way
by the Advice of our Old Indian We had not gone past two Miles
eer we met with about 500 Tuskeruros in one HuntingQuarter
They had made themselves Streets of Houses built with PineBark
not with round Tops as they commonly use but RidgeFashion after the manner
of most other Indians We got nothing amongst them but Corn
Flesh being not plentiful by reason of the great Number of their People
For tho they are expert Hunters yet they are too populous for one Range
which makes Venison very scarce to what it is amongst other Indians
that are fewer no Savages living so well for Plenty as those near the Sea
I saw amongst these a Humpbackd Indian which was the only crooked one
I ever met withal About two a Clock we reachd one of their Towns
in which there was no body left but an Old Woman or two the rest being gone
to their HuntingQuarters We could find no Provision at that Place
We had a Tuskeruro that came in company with us from the lower Quarter
who took us to his Cabin and gave us what it afforded which was Cornmeat

Thursday
This Day we passd through several Swamps and going not above a dozen Miles
came to a Cabin the Master whereof usd to trade amongst the English
He told us If we would stay Two Nights he would conduct us safe to them
himself designing at that time to go and fetch some Rum
so we resolved to tarry for his Company During our Stay
there happend to be a Young Woman troubled with Fits
The Doctor who was sent for to assist her laid her on her Belly
and made a small Incision with RattleSnakeTeeth then laying his Mouth
to the Place he suckd out near a Quart of black conglutinated Blood
and Serum Our Landlord gave us the Tail of a Bever
which was a choice Food Friday There happend also to be
a Burial of one of their Dead which Ceremony is much the same with
that of the Santees who make a great Feast at the Interment of their Corps
The small Runs of Water hereabout afford great Plenty of CrawFish
full as large as those in England and nothing inferior in Goodness

Saturday
Saturday Morning our Patron with Enoe Will and his Servant
set out with us for the English In the Afternoon we ferried
over a River in a Canoe called by the Indians Chattookau
which is the NW Branch of NeusRiver We lay in the Swamp
where some Indians invited us to go to their Quarters
which some of our Company accepted but got nothing extraordinary
except a dozen Miles March out of their Way The Country here
is very thick of Indian Towns and Plantations

Sunday
We were forced to march this day for Want of Provisions About 10 a Clock
we met an Indian that had got a parcel of ShadFish ready barbakud
We bought 24 of them for a dressd DoeSkin and so went on
through many Swamps finding this day the long ragged Moss on the Trees
which we had not seen for above 600 Miles In the Afternoon
we came upon the Banks of Pampticough about 20 Miles above
the English Plantations by Water though not so far by Land
The Indian found a Canoe which he had hidden in which
we all got over and went about six Miles farther We lay that Night
under two or three Pieces of Bark at the Foot of a large Oak
There fell abundance of Snow and Rain in the Night with much
Thunder and Lightning

Monday
Next Day it cleard up and it being about 12 Miles to the English
about halfway we passed over a deep Creek and came safe
to Mr Richard Smiths of PampticoughRiver in NorthCarolina
where being well receivd by the Inhabitants and pleasd with
the Goodness of the Country we all resolvd to continue

 A
 DESCRIPTION
 of
 NorthCAROLINA



Carolina how bounded
The Province of Carolina is separated from Virginia by a due WestLine
which begins at CurrituckInlet in 36 Degrees 30 Minutes
of NorthernLatitude and extends indefinitely to the Westward
and thence to the Southward as far as 29 Degrees which is a vast Tract
of SeaCoast But having already treated as far as is necessary
concerning SouthCarolina I shall confine myself in the ensuing Sheets
to give my Reader a Description of that Part of the Country only
which lies betwixt Currituck and CapeFair and is almost 34 Deg North
And this is commonly calld North Carolina

This Part of Carolina is faced with a Chain of SandBanks
which defends it from the Violence and Insults of the Atlantick Ocean
by which Barrier a vast Sound is hemmd in which fronts
the Mouths of the Navigable and Pleasant Rivers of this Fertile Country
and into which they disgorge themselves Inlets Thro the same
are Inlets of several Depths of Water Some of their Channels
admit only of Sloops Brigantines small Barks and Ketches
and such are Currituck Ronoak and up the Sound above Hatteras
Whilst others can receive Ships of Burden as Ocacock TopsailInlet
and CapeFair as appears by my Chart

First Colony of Carolina
The first Discovery and Settlement of this Country was by the Procurement
of Sir Walter Raleigh in Conjunction with some publickspirited Gentlemen
of that Age under the Protection of Queen Elizabeth
for which Reason it was then named Virginia being begun on that Part
called RonoakIsland where the Ruins of a Fort are to be seen at this day
as well as some old English Coins which have been lately found
and a BrassGun a PowderHorn and one small Quarter deckGun
made of Iron Staves and hoopd with the same Metal which Method
of making Guns might very probably be made use of in those Days
for the Convenience of InfantColonies

Hatteras Indians
A farther Confirmation of this we have from the Hatteras Indians
who either then lived on RonoakIsland or much frequented it
These tell us that several of their Ancestors were white People
and could talk in a Book as we do the Truth of which is confirmd
by gray Eyes being found frequently amongst these Indians and no others
They value themselves extremely for their Affinity to the English
and are ready to do them all friendly Offices It is probable
that this Settlement miscarryd for want of timely Supplies from England
or thro the Treachery of the Natives for we may reasonably suppose that
the English were forced to cohabit with them for Relief and Conversation
and that in process of Time they conformd themselves
to the Manners of their Indian Relations And thus we see
how apt Humane Nature is to degenerate

Sir Walter Raleighs Ship
I cannot forbear inserting here a pleasant Story that passes
for an uncontested Truth amongst the Inhabitants of this Place
which is that the Ship which brought the first Colonies
does often appear amongst them under Sail in a gallant Posture
which they call Sir Walter Raleighs Ship And the truth of this
has been affirmd to me by Men of the best Credit in the Country

Second Settlement of NorthCarolina
A second Settlement of this Country was made about fifty Years ago
in that part we now call AlbemarlCounty and chiefly in Chuwon Precinct
by several substantial Planters from Virginia and other Plantations
Who finding mild Winters and a fertile Soil beyond Expectation
producing every thing that was planted to a prodigious Increase
their Cattle Horses Sheep and Swine breeding very fast
and passing the Winter without any Assistance from the Planter
so that every thing seemd to come by Nature the Husbandman living
almost void of Care and free from those Fatigues which are absolutely
requisite in WinterCountries for providing Fodder and other Necessaries
these Encouragements inducd them to stand their Ground
altho but a handful of People seated at great Distances one from another
and amidst a vast number of Indians of different Nations
who were then in Carolina Nevertheless I say the Fame of this
newdiscoverd SummerCountry spread thro the neighbouring Colonies
and in a few Years drew a considerable Number of Families thereto
who all found Land enough to settle themselves in had they been
many Thousands more and that which was very good and commodiously seated
both for Profit and Pleasure Pleasantness of Carolina
And indeed most of the Plantations in Carolina naturally enjoy
a noble Prospect of large and spacious Rivers pleasant Savannas
and fine Meadows with their green Liveries interwoven with
beautiful Flowers of most glorious Colours which the several Seasons afford
hedgd in with pleasant Groves of the everfamous Tuliptree
the stately Laurel and Bays equalizing the Oak in Bigness and Growth
Myrtles Jessamines Woodbines Honysuckles and several other
fragrant Vines and Evergreens whose aspiring Branches
shadow and interweave themselves with the loftiest Timbers
yielding a pleasant Prospect Shade and Smell proper Habitations
for the Sweetsinging Birds that melodiously entertain such as travel
thro the Woods of Carolina

The Planters possessing all these Blessings and the Produce
of great Quantities of Wheat and Indian Corn in which this Country
is very fruitful as likewise in Beef Pork Tallow Hides DeerSkins
and Furs for these Commodities the NewEnglandMen and Bermudians
visited Carolina in their Barks and Sloops and carryd out what they made
bringing them in Exchange Rum Sugar Salt Molosses
and some wearing Apparel tho the last at very extravagant Prices

As the Land is very fruitful so are the Planters kind and hospitable
to all that come to visit them there being very few Housekeepers
but what live very nobly and give away more Provisions to Coasters and Guests
who come to see them than they expend amongst their own Families



 Of the Inlets and Havens of this Country


Currituck Inlet
The Bar of Currituck being the Northermost of this Country presents itself
first to be treated of It lies in 36 deg 30 min and the Course over
is SW by W having not above seven or eight Foot on the Bar
tho a good Harbour when you are over where you may ride safe
and deep enough but this Part of the Sound is so full of Shoals
as not to suffer any thing to trade thro it that draws above
three Foot Water which renders it very incommodious However
this affects but some part of the Country and may be easily remedied
by carrying their Produce in small Craft down to the Vessels
which ride near the Inlet

Ronoak Inlet
Ronoak Inlet has Ten Foot Water the Course over the Bar
is almost W which leads you thro the best of the Channel This Bar
as well as Currituck often shifts by the Violence of the NE Storms
both lying exposd to those Winds Notwithstanding which
a considerable Trade might be carryd on provided there was a Pilot
to bring them in for it lies convenient for a large Part of this Colony
whose Product would very easily allow of that Charge Lat 35 deg 50 min

Hatteras Inlet
The Inlet of Hatteras lies to the Westward of the Cape
round which is an excellent Harbour When the Wind blows hard
at N or NE if you keep a small League from the CapePoint
you will have 3 4 and 5 Fathom the outermost Shoals lying
about 7 or 8 Leagues from Shoar As you come into the Inlet
keep close to the South Breakers till you are over the Bar
where you will have two Fathom at LowWater You may come to an Anchor
in two Fathom and a Half when you are over then steer over close aboard
the North Shoar where is four Fathom close to a Point of Marsh then steer
up the Sound a long League till you bring the North Cape of the Inlet
to bear SSE half E then steer WNW the Eastpoint of BluffLand
at Hatteras bearing ENE the Southermost large Hammock towards Ocacock
bearing SSW half S then you are in the Sound over the Bar of Sand
whereon is but 6 Foot Water then your Course to Pampticough
is almost West It flows on these three Bars SE by E 14 E about
Eight of the Clock unless there is a hard Gale of Wind at NE which
will make it flow two hours longer but as soon as the Wind is down
the Tides will have their natural Course A hard Gale at N or NW will make
the Water ebb sometimes 24 hours but still the Tide will ebb and flow
tho not seen by the turning thereof but may be seen
by the Rising of the Water and Falling of the same Lat 35d 20

Ocacock Inlet
Ocacock is the best Inlet and Harbour yet in this Country
and has 13 Foot at Lowwater upon the Bar There are two Channels
one is but narrow and lies close aboard the South Cape
the other in the Middle viz between the Middle Ground
and the South Shoar and is above half a Mile wide The Bar itself
is but half a Cables Length over and then you are in 7 or 8 Fathom Water
a good Harbour The Course into the Sound is NNW At Highwater
and Neaptides here is 18 Foot Water It lies SW from Hatteras Inlet
Lat 35d 8

Topsail Inlet
Topsail Inlet is above two Leagues to the Westward of Cape Lookout
You have a fair Channel over the Bar and two Fathom thereon
and a good Harbour in five or six Fathom to come to an Anchor
Your Course over this Bar is almost NW Lat 34d 44

Cape Fair Inlet and River
As for the Inlet and River of Cape Fair I cannot give you
a better Information thereof than has been already deliverd
by the Gentlemen who were sent on purpose from Barbados
to make a Discovery of that River in the Year 1663 which is thus


From Tuesday the 29th of September to Friday the 2d of October
we rangd along the Shoar from Lat 32 deg 20 min to Lat 33 deg 11 min
but could discern no Entrance for our Ship after we had passd
to the Northward of 32 deg 40 min On Saturday Octob 3
a violent Storm overtook us the Wind between North and East
which Easterly Winds and Foul Weather continud till Monday the 12th
by reason of which Storms and Foul Weather we were forced
to get off to Sea to secure Ourselves and Ship and were driven
by the Rapidity of a strong Current to Cape Hatteras in Lat 35 deg 30 min
On Monday the 12th aforesaid we came to an Anchor in seven Fathom
at CapeFair Road and took the Meridian Altitude of the Sun
and were in Latitude 33 deg 43 min the Wind continuing still easterly
and foul Weather till Thursday the 15th and on Friday the 16th
the Wind being at NW we weighd and saild up CapeFairRiver
some 4 or 5 Leagues and came to an Anchor in 6 or 7 Fathom
at which time several Indians came on board and brought us
great Store of fresh Fish large Mullets young Bass Shads
and several other Sorts of very good welltasted Fish
On Saturday the 17th we went down to the Cape to see
the English Cattle but could not find em tho we rounded the Cape
And having an Indian Guide with us here we rode till Oct 24
The Wind being against us we could not go up the River with our Ship
but went on shoar and viewd the Land of those Quarters On Saturday
we weighd and saild up the River some 4 Leagues or thereabouts
Sunday the 25th we weighd again and rowd up the River it being calm
and got up some 14 Leagues from the Harbours Mouth where we mord our Ship
On Monday Oct the 26th we went down with the Yawl to Necoes
an Indian Plantation and viewd the Land there On Tuesday the 27th
we rowd up the main River with our LongBoat and 12 Men
some 10 Leagues or thereabouts On Wednesday the 28th
we rowd up about 8 or 10 Leagues more Thursday the 29th
was foul Weather with much Rain and Wind which forcd us to make Huts
and lie still Friday the 30th we proceeded up the main River
7 or 8 Leagues Saturday the 31st we got up 3 or 4 Leagues more
and came to a Tree that lay cross the River but because our Provisions
were almost spent we proceeded no farther but returnd downward
before Night and on Monday the 2d of November we came aboard our Ship
Tuesday the 3d we lay still to refresh ourselves On Wednesday the 4th
we went 5 or 6 Leagues up the River to search a Branch
that run out of the main River towards the NW In which Branch
we went up 5 or 6 Leagues but not liking the Land returnd on board
that Night about Midnight and calld that Place SwampyBranch
Thursday November the 5th we stayd aboard On Friday the 6th
we went up GreensRiver the Mouth of it being against the Place at which
rode our Ship On Saturday the 7th we proceeded up the said River
some 14 or 15 Leagues in all and found it ended in several small Branches
The Land for the most part being marshy and Swamps we returnd
towards our Ship and got aboard it in the Night Sunday November the 8th
we lay still and on Monday the 9th went again up the main River
being well stockd with Provisions and all things necessary
and proceeded upwards till Thursday noon the 12th at which time
we came to a Place where were two Islands in the Middle of the River
and by reason of the Crookedness of the River at that Place several Trees
lay cross both Branches which stopd the Passage of each Branch
so that we could proceed no farther with our Boat but went up the River side
by Land some 3 or 4 Miles and found the River wider and wider
So we returnd leaving it as far as we could see up a long Reach
running NE we judging ourselves near fifty Leagues North
from the Rivers Mouth In our Return we viewd the Land
on both Sides the River and found as good Tracts of dry wellwooded
pleasant and delightful Ground as we have seen any where in the World
with abundance of long thick Grass on it the Land being very level
with steep Banks on both Sides the River and in some Places very high
the Woods stord every where with great Numbers of Deer and Turkies
we never going on Shoar but we saw of each Sort as also
great Store of Partridges Cranes and Conies in several Places
we likewise heard several Wolves howling in the Woods
and saw where they had torn a Deer in Pieces Also in the River
we saw great Store of Ducks Teal Widgeon and in the Woods
great Flocks of Parrakeetos The Timber that the Woods afford
for the most part consists of Oaks of four or five Sorts
all differing in Leaves but each bearing very good Acorns
We measurd many of the Oaks in several Places which we found to be
in Bigness some Two some Three and others almost Four Fathom in Height
before you come to Boughs or Limbs forty fifty sixty Foot and some more
and those Oaks very common in the upper Parts of both Rivers
also a very tall large Tree of great Bigness which some call Cyprus
the right Name we know not growing in Swamps Likewise Walnut Birch
Beech Maple Ash Bay Willow Alder and Holly and in the lowermost Parts
innumerable Pines tall and good for Boards or Masts
growing for the most part in barren and sandy but in some Places
up the River in good Ground being mixt amongst Oaks and other Timbers
We saw MulberryTrees Multitudes of GrapeVines and some Grapes
which we eat of We found a very large and good Tract of Land
on the NW Side of the River thin of Timber except here and there
a very great Oak and full of Grass commonly as high
as a Mans Middle and in many Places to his Shoulders
where we saw many Deer and Turkies one Deer having very large Horns
and great Body therefore calld it StagPark It being
a very pleasant and delightful Place we travelld in it several Miles
but saw no End thereof So we returnd to our Boat and proceeded
down the River and came to another Place some twenty five Leagues
from the Rivers Mouth on the same Side where we found a Place
no less delightful than the former and as far as we could judge
both Tracts came into one This lower Place we calld Rocky Point
because we found many Rocks and Stones of several Sizes upon the Land
which is not common We sent our Boat down the River before us
ourselves travelling by Land many Miles Indeed we were so much taken
with the Pleasantness of the Country that we travelld into the Woods
too far to recover our Boat and Company that Night The next day
being Sunday we got to our Boat and on Monday the 16th of November
proceeded down to a Place on the EastSide of the River
some 23 Leagues from the Harbours Mouth which we calld TurkyQuarters
because we killd several Turkies thereabouts we viewd the Land there
and found some Tracts of good Ground and high facing upon the River
about one Mile inward but backwards some two Miles all Pine Land
but good Pasture Ground We returnd to our Boat and proceeded down
some 2 or 3 Leagues where we had formerly viewd and found it
a Tract of as good Land as any we have seen and had as good Timber on it
The Banks on the River being high therefore we calld it HighLandPoint
Having viewd that we proceeded down the River going on Shoar
in several Places on both Sides it being generally large Marshes
and many of them dry that they may more fitly be calld Meadows
The WoodLand against them is for the most part Pine
and in some Places as barren as ever we saw Land but in other Places
good PastureGround On Tuesday November the 17th we got aboard our Ship
riding against the Mouth of Greens River where our Men
were providing Wood and fitting the Ship for the Sea In the interim
we took a View of the Country on both sides of the River there
finding some good Land but more bad and the best not comparable
to that above Friday the 20th was foul Weather yet in the Afternoon
we weighd went down the River about two Leagues and came to an Anchor
against the Mouth of Hiltons River and took a View of the Land there
on both sides which appeard to us much like that at Greens River
Monday the 23d we went with our LongBoat well victualld and mannd
up Hiltons River and when we came three Leagues or thereabouts
up the same we found this and Greens River to come into one
and so continud for four or five Leagues which makes a great Island
betwixt them We proceeded still up the River till they parted again
keeping up Hiltons River on the Larboard side and followd the said River
five or six Leagues farther where we found another large Branch
of Greens River to come into Hiltons which makes another great Island
On the Starboard side going up we proceeded still up the River
some four Leagues and returnd taking a View of the Land on both sides
and then judgd ourselves to be from our Ship some 18 Leagues W and by N
One League below this Place came four Indians in a Canoe to us
and sold us several Baskets of Acorns which we satisfyd them for
and so left them but one of them followd us on the Shoar
some two or three Miles till he came on the Top of a high Bank
facing on the River and as we rowd underneath it the Fellow
shot an Arrow at us which very narrowly missd one of our Men
and stuck in the upper edge of the Boat but broke in pieces
leaving the Head behind Hereupon we presently made to the Shoar
and went all up the Bank except Four to guide the Boat
to look for the Indian but could not find him At last
we heard some sing farther in the Woods which we lookd upon
as a Challenge to us to come and fight them We went towards them
with all Speed but before we came in Sight of them heard two Guns go off
from our Boat whereupon we retreated as fast as we could
to secure our Boat and Men When we came to them we found all well
and demanded the Reason of their firing the Guns They told us
that an Indian came creeping along the Bank as they supposd
to shoot at them and therefore they shot at him at a great distance
with small Shot but thought they did him no Hurt for they saw him run away
Presently after our Return to the Boat and while we were thus talking
came two Indians to us with their Bows and Arrows crying Bonny Bonny
We took their Bows and Arrows from them and gave them Beads
to their Content then we led them by the Hand to the Boat
and shewd them the Arrowhead sticking in her Side and related to them
the whole Passage which when they understood both of them shewd
a great Concern and signifyd to us by Signs that they knew nothing of it
so we let them go and markd a Tree on the Top of the Bank
calling the Place MountSkerry We lookd up the River
as far as we could discern and saw that it widend and came running
directly down the Country So we returnd viewing the Land
on both sides the River and finding the Banks steep in some places
but very high in others The Banksides are generally Clay
and as some of our Company did affirm some Marl The Land and Timber
up this River is no way inferiour to the best in the other which we call
the main River So far as we could discern this seemd as fair
if not fairer than the former and we think runs farther into the Country
because a strong Current comes down and a great deal more DriftWood
But to return to the Business of the Land and Timber We saw
several Plots of Ground cleard by the Indians after their weak manner
compassd round with great Timber Trees which they are nowise able to fell
and so keep the Sun from CornFields very much yet nevertheless
we saw as large Cornstalks or larger than we have seen any where else
So we proceeded down the River till we found the Canoe the Indian was in
who shot at us In the Morning we went on Shoar and cut the same in pieces
The Indians perceiving us coming towards them ran away
Going to his Hutt we pulld it down broke his Pots Platters and Spoons
tore the DeerSkins and Matts in pieces and took away a Basket of Acorns
and afterwards proceeded down the River 2 Leagues or thereabouts
and came to another Place of Indians bought Acorns and some Corn of them
and went downwards 2 Leagues more At last espying an Indian
peeping over a high Bank we held up a Gun at him and calling to him
Skerry presently several Indians came in Sight of us
and made great Signs of Friendship saying Bonny Bonny
Then running before us they endeavourd to persuade us to come on shoar
but we answerd them with stern Countenances and calld out Skerry
taking up our Guns and threatning to shoot at them
but they still cryd Bonny Bonny And when they saw
they could not prevail nor persuade us to come on shoar
two of them came off to us in a Canoe one paddling with a great Cane
the other with his Hand As soon as they overtook us
they laid hold of our Boat sweating and blowing and told us
it was Bonny on shoar and at last persuaded us to go on shoar with them
As soon as we landed several Indians to the Number of near 40 lusty Men
came to us all in a great Sweat and told us Bonny
We shewd em the ArrowHead in the BoatSide and a Piece of the Canoe
we had cut in Pieces Whereupon the chief Man amongst them
made a long Speech threw Beads into our Boat which is
a Sign of great Love and Friendship and gave us to understand
that when he heard of the Affront which we had receivd
it causd him to cry and that he and his Men were come
to make Peace with us assuring us by Signs that they would tye the Arms
and cut off the Head of the Fellow who had done us that Wrong
And for a farther Testimony of their Love and GoodWill towards us
they presented us with two very handsome proper young Indian Women
the tallest that ever we saw in this Country which we supposd to be
the Kings Daughters or Persons of Distinction amongst them
Those young Women were so ready to come into our Boat
that one of them crowded in and would hardly be persuaded to go out again
We presented the King with a Hatchet and several Beads
and made Presents of Beads also to the young Women the chief Men
and the rest of the Indians as far as our Beads would go
They promisd us in four Days to come on board our Ship
and so departed from us When we left the Place which was soon after
we calld it MountBonny because we had there concluded a firm Peace
Proceeding down the River 2 or 3 Leagues farther we came to a Place
where were 9 or 10 Canoes all together We went ashoar there
and found several Indians but most of them were the same
which had made Peace with us before We staid very little at that Place
but went directly down the River and came to our Ship before day
Thursday the 26th of November the Wind being at South
we could not go down to the Rivers Mouth but on Friday the 27th
we weighd at the Mouth of Hiltons River and got down
a League towards the Harbours Mouth On Sunday the 29th
we got down to CraneIsland which is 4 Leagues or thereabouts
above the Entrance of the Harbours Mouth On Tuesday the 1st of December
we made a Purchase of the River and Land of CapeFair of WatCoosa
and such other Indians as appeard to us to be the chief of those Parts
They brought us Store of fresh Fish aboard as Mullets Shads
and other sorts very good This River is all fresh Water fit to drink
Some 8 Leagues within the Mouth the Tide runs up about 35 Leagues
but stops and rises a great deal farther up It flows at the Harbours Mouth
SE and NW 6 Foot at NeapTides and 8 Foot at SpringTides
The Channel on the East side by the CapeShoar is the best
and lies close aboard the CapeLand being 3 Fathoms at high Water
in the shallowest Place in the Channel just at the Entrance
But as soon as you are past that Place half a Cables Length inward
you have 6 or 7 Fathoms a fair turning Channel into the River
and so continuing 5 or 6 Leagues upwards Afterwards the Channel
is more difficult in some Places 6 or 7 Fathoms in others 4 or 5
and in others but 9 or 10 Foot especially where the River is broad
When the River comes to part and grows narrow there it is
all Channel from side to side in most Places tho in some
you shall have 5 6 or 7 Fathoms but generally 2 or 3 Sand and Oaze
We viewd the CapeLand and judgd it to be little worth
the Woods of it being shrubby and low and the Land sandy and barren
in some Places Grass and Rushes in others nothing but clear Sand
A Place fitter to starve Cattle in our Judgment than to keep em alive
yet the Indians as we understand keep the English Cattle down there
and suffer them not to go off of the said Cape as we suppose
because the Country Indians shall have no Part with them
and therefore tis likely they have fallen out about them
which shall have the greatest Share They brought on board our Ship
very good and fat Beef several times which they sold us
at a very reasonable Price also fat and very large Swine good and cheap
but they may thank their Friends of NewEngland who brought their Hogs
to so fair a Market Some of the Indians brought very good Salt aboard us
and made Signs pointing to both sides of the Rivers Mouth
that there was great Store thereabouts We saw up the River
several good Places for the setting up of Corn or SawMills
In that time as our Business calld us up and down the River and Branches
we killd of wild Fowl 4 Swans 10 Geese 29 Cranes
10 Turkies 40 Ducks and Mallards 3 dozen of Parrakeetos
and 6 dozen of other small Fowls as Curlues and Plover c

Whereas there was a Writing left in a Post at the Point of CapeFair River
by those NewEnglandMen that left Cattle with the Indians there
the Contents whereof tended not only to the Disparagement of the Land
about the said River but also to the great Discouragement
of all such as should hereafter come into those Parts to settle
In answer to that scandalous Writing We whose Names are underwritten
do affirm That we have seen facing both sides the River and Branches
of CapeFair aforesaid as good Land and as well timberd
as any we have seen in any other Part of the World sufficient to accommodate
Thousands of our English Nation and lying commodiously
by the said Rivers Side

On Friday the 4th of December the Wind being fair we put out to Sea
bound for Barbados and on the 6th of February 1664
came to an Anchor in CarlisleBay it having pleasd God
after several apparent Dangers both by Sea and Land to bring us all in Safety
to our longwishdfor and muchdesird Port to render an Account
of our Discovery the Verity of which we do assert

Thus you have an Account of the Latitude Soil and Advantages of CapeFair
or ClarendonRiver which was settled in the Year 1661 or thereabouts
and had it not been for the irregular Practices of some of that Colony
against the Indians by sending away some of their Children
as I have been told under Pretence of instructing em in Learning
and the Principles of the Christian Religion which so disgusted
the Indians that tho they had then no Guns yet they never gave over
till they had entirely rid themselves of the English
by their Bows and Arrows with which they did not only take off themselves
but also their Stocks of Cattle And this was so much the more
ruinous to them in that they could have no Assistance from SouthCarolina
which was not then planted and the other Plantations were but
in their Infancy Were it not for such ill Practices I say
it might in all Probability have been at this day the best Settlement
in their Lordships great Province of Carolina

Albemarl Sound and Rivers
The Sound of Albemarl with the Rivers and Creeks of that Country
afford a very rich and durable Soil The Land in most Places
lies indifferent low except in Chuwon and high up the Rivers
but bears an incredible Burden of Timber the LowGrounds being
coverd with Beech and the HighLand yielding lofty Oaks WalnutTrees
and other useful Timber The Country in some Plantations
has yearly producd Indian Corn or some other Grain ever since
this Country was first seated without the Trouble of Manuring or Dressing
and yet to all appearance it seems not to be in the least
impoverishd neither do the Planters ever miss of a good Crop
unless a very unnatural Season visits them which seldom happens



 Of the Corn of Carolina


Wheat
The Wheat of this Place is very good seldom yielding less than thirty fold
provided the Land is good where it is sown Not but that there has been
Sixtysix Increase for one measure sown in PinyLand which we account
the meanest Sort And I have been informd by People of Credit
that Wheat which was planted in a very rich Piece of Land
brought a hundred and odd Pecks for one If our Planters
when they found such great Increase would be so curious as to make
nice Observations of the Soil and other remarkable Accidents
they would soon be acquainted with the Nature of the Earth and Climate
and be better qualified to manage their Agriculture
to more Certainty and greater Advantage whereby they might arrive
to the Crops and Harvests of Babylon and those other fruitful Countries
so much talkd of For I must confess I never saw one Acre of Land
managd as it ought to be in Carolina since I knew it
and were they as negligent in their Husbandry in Europe
as they are in Carolina their Land would produce nothing
but Weeds and Straw

Rye
They have tryd Rye and it thrives very well but having
such Plenty of Maiz they do not regard it because it makes black Bread
unless very curiously handled

Barley
Barley has been sowed in small quantities and does better
than can be expected because that Grain requires the Ground
to be very well workd with repeated Ploughings which our general Way
of breaking the Earth with Hoes can by no means perform
tho in several Places we have a light rich deep black Mould
which is the particular Soil in which Barley best thrives

Oats
The naked Oats thrive extraordinary well and the other would prove
a very bold Grain but the Plenty of other Grains makes them not much coveted

Maiz
The Indian Corn or Maiz proves the most useful Grain in the World
and had it not been for the Fruitfulness of this Species
it would have proved very difficult to have settled some of the Plantations
in America It is very nourishing whether in Bread sodden or otherwise
And those poor Christian Servants in Virginia Maryland
and the other northerly Plantations that have been forced to live
wholly upon it do manifestly prove that it is the most nourishing Grain
for a Man to subsist on without any other Victuals And this Assertion
is made good by the NegroSlaves who in many Places eat nothing
but this Indian Corn and Salt Pigs and Poultry fed with this Grain
eat the sweetest of all others It refuses no Grounds
unless the barren Sands and when planted in good Ground
will repay the Planter seven or eight hundred fold besides the Stalks
bruisd and boild make very pleasant Beer being sweet like the SugarCane

Rice
There are several sorts of Rice some bearded others not
besides the red and white But the white Rice is the best
Yet there is a sort of perfumd Rice in the EastIndies
which gives a curious Flavour in the Dressing And with this sort
America is not yet acquainted neither can I learn that any of it
has been brought over to Europe the Rice of Carolina being esteemd
the best that comes to that Quarter of the World It is of great Increase
yielding from eight hundred to a thousandfold and thrives best in wild Land
that has never been broken up before

BuckWheat is of great Increase in Carolina but we make no other use of it
than instead of Maiz to feed Hogs and Poultry GuineaWheat
And Guinea Corn which thrives well here serves for the same use

Pulse BushelBean
Of the Pulsekind we have many sorts The first is the BushelBean
which is a spontaneous Product They are so called because they bring
a Bushel of Beans for one that is planted They are set in the Spring
round Arbours or at the Feet of Poles up which they will climb
and cover the Wattling making a very pretty Shade to sit under
They continue flowering budding and ripening all the Summer long
till the Frost approaches when they forbear their Fruit and die
The Stalks they grow on come to the Thickness of a Mans Thumb
and the Bean is white and mottled with a purple Figure on each side it
like an Ear They are very flat and are eaten as the WindsorBean is
being an extraordinary wellrelishd Pulse either by themselves
or with Meat

Indian Rouncevals
We have the Indian Rounceval or Miraculous Pease so calld
from their long Pods and great Increase These are latter Pease
and require a pretty long Summer to ripen in Pease and Beans
They are very good and so are the Bonavis Calavancies Nanticokes
and abundance of other Pulse too tedious here to name
which we found the Indians possessd of when first we settled in America
some of which sorts afford us two Crops in one Year
as the Bonavis and Calavancies besides several others of that kind

Eng Bean
Now I am launchd into a Discourse of the Pulse I must acquaint you
that the European Bean planted here will in time degenerate into
a dwarfish sort if not prevented by a yearly Supply of foreign Seed
and an extravagant rich Soil yet these PigmyBeans are
the sweetest of that kind I ever met withal

Pease
As for all the sorts of English Pease that we have yet
made tryal of they thrive very well in Carolina Particularly
the white and gray Rouncival the common FieldPease
and SicklePease yield very well and are of a good Relish
As for the other sorts I have not seen any made tryal of as yet
but question not their coming to great Perfection with us

KidneyBean
The KidneyBeans were here before the English came being very plentiful
in the Indian CornFields

Roots
The GardenRoots that thrive well in Carolina are Carrots Leeks
Parsnips Turneps Potatoes of several delicate sorts Ground Artichokes
Radishes HorseRadish Beet both sorts Onions Shallot Garlick Cives
and the WildOnions

Sallads
The Sallads are the Lettice Curld Red Cabbage and Savoy
The Spinage round and prickly Fennel sweet and the common Sort
Samphire in the Marshes excellent so is the Dock or WildRhubarb
Rocket Sorrel French and English Cresses of several Sorts
Purslain wild and that of a larger Size which grows in the Gardens
No Purslain in Indian Fields for this Plant is never met withal
in the Indian Plantations and is therefore supposd to proceed
from CowDung which Beast they keep not Parsley two Sorts
Asparagus thrives to a Miracle without hot Beds or dunging the Land
WhiteCabbage from European or NewEngland Seed for the People
are negligent and unskilful and dont take care to provide Seed of their own
The CollyFlower we have not yet had an Opportunity to make Tryal of
nor has the Artichoke ever appeard amongst us that I can learn
Coleworts plain and curld Savoys besides the WaterMelons
of several Sorts very good which should have gone amongst the Fruits
Of MuskMelons we have very large and good and several Sorts
as the Golden Green Guinea and Orange Cucumbers long short
and prickly all these from the Natural Ground and great Increase
without any Helps of Dung or Reflection Pompions yellow and very large
Burmillions Cashaws an excellent Fruit boild Squashes Simnals
Horns and Gourds besides many other Species of less Value
too tedious to name

Potherbs and others for Physick
Our Potherbs and others of use which we already possess
are Angelica wild and tame Balm Bugloss Borage Burnet
Clary Marigold PotMarjoram and other Marjorams Summer and Winter Savory
Columbines Tansey Wormwood Nep Mallows several Sorts Drage red and white
Lambs Quarters Thyme Hyssop of a very large Growth sweet Bazil
Rosemary Lavender The more Physical are Carduus Benedictus
the Scurvygrass of America I never here met any of the European sort
Tobacco of many sorts Dill Carawa Cummin Anise Coriander
all sorts of Plantain of England and two sorts spontaneous
good Vulneraries Elecampane Comfrey Nettle the Seed from England
none Native Monks Rhubarb Burdock Asarum wild in the Woods
reckond one of the SnakeRoots Poppies in the Garden
none wild yet discoverd Wormseed Feverfew Rue GroundIvy spontaneous
but very small and scarce Aurea virga RattleSnakes
four sorts of SnakeRoots besides the common Species
which are great Antidotes against that Serpents Bite and are easily raisd
in the Garden Mint JamesTownWeed the Seed like Onion Seed
JamesTownWeed so called from Virginia the Seed it bears
is very like that of an Onion it is excellent for curing Burns
and asswaging Inflammations but taken inwardly brings on
a sort of drunken Madness One of our MarshWeeds like a Dock
has the same Effect and possesses the Party with Fear and Watchings
The RedRoot whose Leaf is like SpearMint is good for
Thrushes and sore Mouths Camomil but it must be kept in the Shade
otherwise it will not thrive Housleek first from England
Vervin NightShade several kinds HartsTongue Yarrow abundance
Mullein the same both of the Country Sarsaparilla and abundance more
I could name yet not the hundredth part of what remains a Catalogue of which
is a Work of many Years and without any other Subject would swell
to a large Volume and requires the Abilities of a skilful Botanist
Had not the ingenious Mr Banister the greatest Virtuoso we ever had
on the Continent been unfortunately taken out of this World
he would have given the best Account of the Plants of America
of any that ever yet made such an Attempt in these Parts
Not but we are satisfyd the Species of Vegetables in Carolina
are so numerous that it requires more than one Mans Age
to bring the chiefest Part of them into regular Classes
the Country being so different in its Situation and Soil
that what one place plentifully affords another is absolutely a stranger to
yet we generally observe that the greatest Variety is found
in the Low Grounds and Savannas

Flowers
The FlowerGarden in Carolina is as yet arrivd but to
a very poor and jejune Perfection We have only two sorts of Roses
the CloveJulyFlowers Violets Princes Feather and Tres Colores
There has been nothing more cultivated in the FlowerGarden
which at present occurs to my Memory but as for the wild
spontaneous Flowers of this Country Nature has been so liberal
that I cannot name one tenth part of the valuable ones And since
to give Specimens would only swell the Volume and give little Satisfaction
to the Reader I shall therefore proceed to the Present State of Carolina
and refer the Shrubs and other Vegetables of larger Growth till hereafter
and then shall deliver them and the other Species in their Order



 The Present State of Carolina


When we consider the Latitude and convenient Situation of Carolina
had we no farther Confirmation thereof our Reason would inform us
that such a Place lay fairly to be a delicious Country
being placed in that Girdle of the World which affords Wine Oil Fruit
Grain and Silk with other rich Commodities besides a sweet Air
moderate Climate and fertile Soil these are the Blessings
under Heavens Protection that spin out the Thread of Life
to its utmost Extent and crown our Days with the Sweets of Health and Plenty
which when joind with Content renders the Possessors
the happiest Race of Men upon Earth

The Present State of Carolina
The Inhabitants of Carolina thro the Richness of the Soil
live an easy and pleasant Life The Land being of several sorts of Compost
some stiff others light some marl others rich black Mould
here barren of Pine but affording Pitch Tar and Masts
there vastly rich especially on the Freshes of the Rivers
one part bearing great Timbers others being Savannas or natural Meads
where no Trees grow for several Miles adornd by Nature
with a pleasant Verdure and beautiful Flowers frequent in no other Places
yielding abundance of Herbage for Cattle Sheep and Horse
The Country in general affords pleasant Seats the Land
except in some few Places being dry and high Banks Necks of Land
parcelld out into most convenient Necks by the Creeks
easy to be fenced in for securing their Stocks to more strict Boundaries
whereby with a small trouble of fencing almost every Man
may enjoy to himself an entire Plantation or rather Park
These with the other Benefits of Plenty of Fish WildFowl Venison
and the other Conveniencies which this SummerCountry naturally furnishes
has inducd a great many Families to leave the more Northerly Plantations
and sit down under one of the mildest Governments in the World
in a Country that with moderate Industry will afford all
the Necessaries of Life We have yearly abundance of Strangers
come among us who chiefly strive to go Southerly to settle
because there is a vast Tract of rich Land betwixt the Place we are seated in
and CapeFair and upon that River and more Southerly
which is inhabited by none but a few Indians who are at this time
well affected to the English and very desirous of their coming
to live among them Purchase of Land The more Southerly
the milder Winters with the Advantages of purchasing the Lords Land
at the most easy and moderate Rate of any Lands in America
nay allowing all Advantages thereto annexd I may say
the Universe does not afford such another Besides Men have
a great Advantage of choosing good and commodious Tracts of Land
at the first Seating of a Country or River whereas the later Settlers
are forced to purchase smaller Dividends of the old Standers
and sometimes at very considerable Rates Land in Virginia and Maryland
as now in Virginia and Maryland where a thousand Acres of good Land
cannot be bought under twenty Shillings an Acre besides two Shillings
yearly Acknowledgment for every hundred Acres which Sum
be it more or less will serve to put the Merchant or Planter here
into a good posture of Buildings Slaves and other Necessaries
when the Purchase of his Land comes to him on such easy Terms
Stocks Increase And as our Grain and Pulse thrives with us to admiration
no less do our Stocks of Cattle Horses Sheep and Swine multiply

Beef
The Beef of Carolina equalizes the best that our neighbouring
Colonies afford the Oxen are of a great size when they are sufferd to live
to a fit Age I have seen fat and good Beef at all times of the Year
but October and the cool Months are the Seasons we kill our Beeves in
when we intend them for Salting or Exportation for then they are in
their prime of Flesh all coming from Grass we never using
any other Food for our Cattle Heifers The Heifers bring Calves
at eighteen or twenty Months old which makes such a wonderful Increase
that many of our Planters from very mean Beginnings have raisd themselves
and are now Masters of hundreds of fat Beeves and other Cattle

Veal
The Veal is very good and white so is the Milk very pleasant and rich
there being at present considerable Quantities of Butter and Cheese made
that is very good not only serving our own Necessities
but we send out a great deal among our Neighbours

Sheep
The Sheep thrive very well at present having most commonly two Lambs
at one yeaning As the Country comes to be opend they prove still better
Change of Pasture being agreeable to that useful Creature
Mutton is generally exceeding Fat and of a good Relish
their Wool is very fine and proves a good Staple

Horses
The Horses are wellshapd and swift the best of them would sell
for ten or twelve Pounds in England They prove excellent Drudges
and will travel incredible Journeys They are troubled with
very few Distempers neither do the cloudyfacd grey Horses go blind here
as in Europe As for Spavins Splints and RingBones
they are here never met withal as I can learn Were we to have
our Stallions and choice of Mares from England or any other of a good Sort
and careful to keep them on the Highlands we could not fail
of a good Breed but having been supplyd with our first Horses
from the neighbouring Plantations which were but mean
they do not as yet come up to the Excellency of the English Horses
tho we generally find that the Colt exceeds in Beauty and Strength
its Sire and Dam

Swine
The Pork exceeds any in Europe the great Diversity and Goodness
of the Acorns and Nuts which the Woods afford making that Flesh
of an excellent Taste and produces great Quantities so that Carolina
if not the chief is not inferior in this one Commodity to any Colony
in the hands of the English

Goats
As for Goats they have been found to thrive and increase well
but being mischievous to Orchards and other Trees makes People decline
keeping them

Produce
Our Produce for Exportation to Europe and the Islands in America
are Beef Pork Tallow Hides DeerSkins Furs Pitch Tar
Wheat IndianCorn Pease Masts Staves Heading Boards
and all sorts of Timber and Lumber for Madera and the WestIndies
Rozin Turpentine and several sorts of Gums and Tears
with some medicinal Drugs are here producd Besides Rice and several other
foreign Grains which thrive very well Good Bricks and Tiles are made
and several sorts of useful Earths as Bole FullersEarth Oaker
and TobaccopipeClay in great plenty Earths for the Potters Trade
and fine Sand for the Glassmakers In building with Bricks
we make our Lime of OysterShells tho we have great Store of Limestone
towards the Heads of our Rivers where are Stones of all sorts
that are useful besides vast Quantities of excellent Marble
IronStone we have plenty of both in the LowGrounds and on the Hills
Lead and Copper has been found so has Antimony heretofore
But no Endeavours have been usd to discover those Subteraneous Species
otherwise we might in all probability find out the best of Minerals
which are not wanting in Carolina Hot Baths we have an account of
from the Indians that frequent the HillCountry Saltpeter
where a great likelihood appears of making Saltpeter because the Earth
in many places is strongly mixd with a nitrous Salt which is much coveted
by the Beasts who come at some Seasons in great Droves and Herds
and by their much licking of this Earth make great Holes in those Banks
which sometimes lie at the heads of great Precipices where their Eagerness
after this Salt hastens their End by falling down the high Banks
so that they are dashd in Pieces It must be confessd
that the most noble and sweetest Part of this Country is not inhabited
by any but the Savages and a great deal of the richest Part thereof
has no Inhabitants but the Beasts of the Wilderness
For the Indians are not inclinable to settle in the richest Land
because the Timbers are too large for them to cut down
and too much burthend with Wood for their Labourers to make Plantations of
besides the Healthfulness of those Hills is apparent
by the Gigantick Stature and GrayHeads so common amongst the Savages
that dwell near the Mountains The great Creator of all things
having most wisely diffusd his Blessings by parcelling out
the Vintages of the World into such Lots as his wonderful Foresight saw
most proper requisite and convenient for the Habitations of his Creatures
Towards the Sea we have the Conveniency of Trade Transportation
and other Helps the Water affords but oftentimes those Advantages
are attended with indifferent Land a thick Air and other Inconveniences
when backwards near the Mountains you meet with the richest Soil
a sweet thin Air dry Roads pleasant small murmuring Streams
and several beneficial Productions and Species which are unknown
in the European World One Part of this Country affords
what the other is wholly a Stranger to

Chalybeate Waters
We have Chalybeate Waters of several Tastes and different Qualities
some purge others work by the other Emunctories We have
amongst the Inhabitants a Water that is inwardly a great Apersive
and outwardly cures Ulcers Tettars and Sores by washing therewith

CoalMine in Virginia
There has been a CoalMine lately found near the Mannakin Town
above the Falls of JamesRiver in Virginia which proves
very good and is usd by the Smiths for their Forges
and we need not doubt of the same amongst us towards the Heads of our Rivers
but the Plenty of Wood which is much the better Fuel
makes us not inquisitive after CoalMines French Refugees
Most of the French who lived at that Town on JamesRiver are removd
to TrentRiver in NorthCarolina where the rest were expected daily
to come to them when I came away which was in August 1708
They are much taken with the Pleasantness of that Country
and indeed are a very industrious People At present they make
very good LinnenCloath and Thread and are very well versd in cultivating
Hemp and Flax of both which they raise very considerable Quantities
and design to try an Essay of the Grape for making of Wine

Planters
As for those of our own Country in Carolina some of the Men
are very laborious and make great Improvements in their Way
but I dare hardly give em that Character in general The easy Way of living
in that plentiful Country makes a great many Planters very negligent
which were they otherwise that Colony might now have been
in a far better Condition than it is as to Trade and other Advantages
which an universal Industry would have led them into

Women good Houswives
The Women are the most industrious Sex in that Place and
by their good Houswifry make a great deal of Cloath of their own Cotton
Wool and Flax some of them keeping their Families though large
very decently appareld both with Linnens and Woollens
so that they have no occasion to run into the Merchants Debt
or lay their Money out on Stores for Cloathing

Natives of Carolina
The Christian Natives of Carolina are a straight cleanlimbd People
the Children being seldom or never troubled with Rickets
or those other Distempers that the Europeans are visited withal
Tis next to a Miracle to see one of them deformd in Body
The Vicinity of the Sun makes Impression on the Men who labour
out of doors or use the Water Beautiful As for those Women
that do not expose themselves to the Weather they are often very fair
and generally as well featurd as you shall see any where
and have very brisk charming Eyes which sets them off to Advantage
They marry very young some at Thirteen or Fourteen and She that stays
till Twenty is reckond a stale Maid which is a very indifferent Character
in that warm Country The Women are very fruitful most Houses
being full of Little Ones It has been observd that Women long marryd
and without Children in other Places have removd to Carolina
and become joyful Mothers They have very easy Travail
in their Childbearing in which they are so happy as seldom to miscarry
Not Passionate Both Sexes are generally spare of Body
and not Cholerick nor easily cast down at Disappointments and Losses
seldom immoderately grieving at Misfortunes unless for
the Loss of their nearest Relations and Friends which seems to make
a more than ordinary Impression upon them Many of the Women
are very handy in Canoes and will manage them with great Dexterity and Skill
which they become accustomed to in this watry Country Good Wives
They are ready to help their Husbands in any servile Work as Planting
when the Season of the Weather requires Expedition Pride seldom banishing
good Houswifry The Girls are not bred up to the Wheel and Sewing only
but the Dairy and Affairs of the House they are very well acquainted withal
so that you shall see them whilst very young manage their Business
with a great deal of Conduct and Alacrity Natives are docile
The Children of both Sexes are very docile and learn any thing
with a great deal of Ease and Method and those that have
the Advantages of Education write good Hands and prove good Accountants
which is most coveted and indeed most necessary in these Parts
The young Men are commonly of a bashful sober Behaviour No Prodigals
few proving Prodigals to consume what the Industry of their Parents
has left them but commonly improve it The marrying so young
carries a double Advantage with it and that is that the Parents see
their Children provided for in Marriage and the young married People
are taught by their Parents how to get their Living for their Admonitions
make great Impressions on their Children Great Age of Americans
I had heard before I knew this new World that the Natives of America
were a shortlivd People which by all the Observations I could ever make
proves quite contrary for those who are born here and in other Colonies
live to as great Ages as any of the Europeans the Climate being free
from Consumptions which Distemper fatal to England they are Strangers to
And as the Country becomes more cleard of Wood it still becomes
more healthful to the Inhabitants and less addicted to the Ague
which is incident to most new Comers into America from Europe
yet not mortal A gentle Emetick seldom misses of driving it away
but if it is not too troublesome tis better to let the Seasoning have
its own Course in which case the Party is commonly free from it ever after
and very healthful

And now as to the other Advantages the Country affords
we cannot guess at them at present because as I said before
the best Part of this Country is not inhabited by the English
from whence probably will hereafter spring Productions that this Age
does not dream of and of much more Advantage to the Inhabitants
than any things we are yet acquainted withal And as for
several Productions of other Countries much in the same Latitude
we may expect with good Management they will become familiar to us
as Wine Oil Fruit Silk and other profitable Commodities
such as Drugs Dyes c And at present the Curious may have
a large Field to satisfy and divert themselves in Collections
as Collections of strange Beasts Birds Insects Reptiles
Shells Fishes Minerals Herbs Flowers Plants Shrubs intricate Roots
Gums Tears Rozins Dyes and Stones with several other that yield
Satisfaction and Profit to those whose Inclinations tend that Way
And as for what may be hopd for towards a happy Life and Being
by such as design to remove thither I shall add this
That with prudent Management I can affirm by Experience not by Hearsay
That any Person with a small Beginning may live very comfortably
and not only provide for the Necessaries of Life but likewise for those
that are to succeed him Provisions very cheap Provisions being
very plentiful and of good Variety to accommodate genteel Housekeeping
and the neighbouring Indians are friendly and in many Cases
serviceable to us in making us Wares to catch Fish in for a small matter
which proves of great Advantage to large Families because those Engines take
great Quantities of many Sorts of Fish that are very good and nourishing
Indians Hunters Some of them hunt and fowl for us at reasonable Rates
the Country being as plentifully provided with all Sorts of Game
as any Part of America the poorer Sort of Planters often get them
to plant for them by hiring them for that Season or for so much Work
which commonly comes very reasonable Moreover it is remarkable
That no Place on the Continent of America has seated an English Colony
so free from Bloodshed as Carolina but all the others have been
more damagd and disturbd by the Indians than they have
which is worthy Notice when we consider how oddly it was first planted
with Inhabitants

FishingTrade
The FishingTrade in Carolina might be carried on to great Advantage
considering how many Sorts of excellent Fish our Sound and Rivers afford
which cure very well with Salt as has been experienced
by some small Quantities which have been sent abroad
and yielded a good Price WhaleFishing As for the Whalefishing
it is no otherwise regarded than by a few People who live on the SandBanks
and those only work on dead Fish cast on shoar none being struck
on our Coast as they are to the Northward altho we have
Plenty of Whales there Great Plenty is generally the Ruin of Industry
Thus our Merchants are not many nor have those few there be
applyd themselves to the European Trade The Planter sits contented
at home whilst his Oxen thrive and grow fat and his Stocks daily increase
The fatted Porkets and Poultry are easily raisd to his Table
and his Orchard affords him Liquor so that he eats and drinks away
the Cares of the World and desires no greater Happiness
than that which he daily enjoys Whereas not only the European
but also the IndianTrade might be carried on to a great Profit
because we lie as fairly for the Body of Indians as any Settlement
in EnglishAmerica IndianTrade And for the small Trade
that has been carried on in that Way the Dealers therein have throve
as fast as any Men and the soonest raisd themselves of any People
I have known in Carolina

Climate
Lastly As to the Climate it is very healthful Summer our Summer
is not so hot as in other places to the Eastward in the same Latitude
No Earthquakes neither are we ever visited by Earthquakes as many places
in Italy and other SummerCountries are Our Northerly Winds in Summer
cool the Air and free us from pestilential Fevers which Spain Barbary
and the neighbouring Countries in Europe c are visited withal
Serene Our Sky is generally serene and clear and the Air very thin
in comparison of many Parts of Europe where Consumptions and Catarrhs reign
amongst the Inhabitants The Winter has several Fitts of sharp Weather
especially when the Wind is at NW which always clears the Sky
though never so thick before However such Weather is very agreeable
to European Bodies and makes them healthy The NE Winds
blowing in Winter bring with them thick Weather and in the Spring
sometimes blight the Fruits but they very seldom endure long
being blown away by Westerly Winds and then all becomes fair and clear again
Spring Our Spring in Carolina is very beautiful
and the most pleasant Weather a Country can enjoy Fall
The Fall is accompanied with cool Mornings which come in
towards the latter end of August and so continue most commonly
very moderate Weather till about Christmas then Winter comes on apace
Tho these Seasons are very piercing yet the Cold is of no continuance
Perhaps you will have cold Weather for three or four days at a time
then pleasant warm Weather follows such as you have in England
about the latter end of April or beginning of May In the Year 1707
we had the severest Winter in Carolina that ever was known
since the English came to settle there for our Rivers
that were not above half a Mile wide and fresh Water were frozen over
and some of them in the Northpart of this Country were passable
for People to walk over

No Frontier
One great Advantage of NorthCarolina is That we are not a Frontier
and near the Enemy which proves very chargeable and troublesome
in time of War to those Colonies that are so seated Near Virginia
Another great Advantage comes from its being near Virginia
where we come often to a good Market at the Return of the GuineaShips
for Negros and the Remnant of their Stores which is very commodious
for the IndianTrade besides in Wartime we lie near at hand
to go under their Convoy and to sell our Provisions to the Tobaccofleets
Mariland for the Planting of Tobacco generally in those Colonies
prevents their being supplyed with Stores sufficient for victualling
their Ships

Necessaries for Carolina
As for the Commodities which are necessary to carry over to this Plantation
for Use and Merchandize and are therefore requisite for those
to have along with them that intend to transport themselves thither
they are Guns Powder and Shot Flints Linnens of all sorts
but chiefly ordinary Blues Osnabrugs Scotch and Irish Linnen
and some fine Mens and Womens Cloaths ready made up some few BroadCloaths
Kerseys and Druggets to which you must add HaberdashersWares
Hats about Five or Six Shillings apiece and a few finer
a few Wiggs not long and pretty thin of Hair thin Stuffs for Women
IronWork as Nails Spades Axes broad and narrow Hoes Frows Wedges
and Saws of all sorts with other Tools for Carpenters Joiners Coopers
Shoemakers Shavelocks c all which and others which are necessary
for the Plantations you may be informd of and buy at very reasonable Rates
of Mr James Gilbert Ironmonger in MitreTavernYard near Aldgate
You may also be used very kindly for your CuttleryWare
and other advantageous Merchandizes and your Cargos well sorted
by Capt Sharp at the Bluegate in Cannonstreet and for EarthenWare
WindowGlass GrindStones MillStones Paper InkPowder
Saddles Bridles and what other things you are minded to take with you
for Pleasure or Ornament

And now I shall proceed to the rest of the Vegetables
that are common in Carolina in reference to the Place where I left off
which is the Natural History of that Country



The Natural History of Carolina



 Of the Vegetables of Carolina


The spontaneous Shrubs of this Country are the LarkheelTree
three sorts of HonySuckleTree the first of which grows in Branches
as our PiementoTree does that is always in low moist Ground
the other grows in clear dry Land the Flower more cut and lacerated
the third which is the most beautiful and I think
the most charming Flower of its Colour I ever saw grows betwixt
two and three Foot high and for the most part by the side of a swampy Wood
or on the Banks of our Rivers but never near the SaltWater All the Sorts
are white the last grows in a great Bunch of these small HonySuckles
set upon one chief Stem and is commonly the Bigness of a large Turnep
Nothing can appear more beautiful than these Bushes when in their Splendour
which is in April and May The next is the HoneySuckle of the Forest
it grows about a Foot high bearing its Flowers on small Pedestals
several of them standing on the main Stock which is the Thickness
of a WheatStraw We have also the Woodbind much the same as in England
Princesfeather very large and beautiful in the Garden TresColores
branchd Sunflower Double Poppies Lupines of several pretty sorts
spontaneous and the Sensible Plant is said to be near the Mountains
which I have not yet seen SafFlower and I believe
the Saffron of England would thrive here if planted the yellow Jessamin
is wild in our Woods of a pleasant Smell EverGreens are here
plentifully found of a very quick Growth and pleasant Shade
Cypress or white Cedar the Pitch Pine the yellow Pine
the white Pine with long Leaves and the smaller AlmondPine which last
bears Kernels in the Apple tasting much like an Almond and in some years
there falls such plenty as to make the Hogs fat HornBeam Cedar
two sorts Holly two sorts BayTree two sorts one the DwarfBay
about twelve Foot high the other the Bigness of a middling PineTree
about two Foot and half Diameter LaurelTrees in Height equalizing
the lofty Oaks the Berries and Leaves of this Tree dyes a Yellow
the BayBerries yield a Wax which besides its Use in Chirurgery
makes Candles that in burning give a fragrant Smell
The CedarBerries are infused and made Beer of by the Bermudians
they are Carminative and much of the Quality of JuniperBerries
Yew and Box I never saw or heard of in this Country There are
two sorts of Myrtles different in Leaf and Berry the Berry yields Wax
that makes Candles the most lasting and of the sweetest Smell imaginable
Some mix half Tallow with this Wax others use it without Mixture
and these are fit for a Ladys Chamber and incomparable
to pass the Line withal and other hot Countries because they will stand
when others will melt by the excessive Heat down in the Binacles
Evergreen Oak two sorts GallBerryTree bearing a black Berry
with which the Women dye their Cloaths and Yarn black
tis a pretty Evergreen and very plentiful growing always
in low swampy Grounds and amongst Ponds We have a Prim or Privet
which grows on the dry barren sandy Hills by the Sound side
it bears a smaller sort than that in England and grows into a round Bush
very beautiful Yaupon Last of Bushes except Savine
which grows every where wild is the famous Yaupon of which I find
two sorts if not three I shall speak first of the Nature of this Plant
and afterwards account for the different Sorts This Yaupon
calld by the SouthCarolina Indians Cassena is a Bush
that grows chiefly on the SandBanks and Islands bordering on
the Sea of Carolina on this Coast it is plentifully found
and in no other Place that I know of It grows the most like Box
of any Vegetable that I know being very like it in Leaf
only dented exactly like Tea but the Leaf somewhat fatter
I cannot say whether it bears any Flower but a Berry it does
about the Bigness of a Grain of Pepper being first red then brown when ripe
which is in December Some of these Bushes grow to be twelve Foot high
others are three or four The Wood thereof is brittle as Myrtle
and affords a light ashcolourd Bark There is sometimes found of it
in Swamps and rich low Grounds which has the same figured Leaf
only it is larger and of a deeper Green This may be occasiond
by the Richness that attends the low Grounds thus situated
The third Sort has the same kind of Leaf but never grows a Foot high
and is found both in rich low Land and on the SandHills
I dont know that ever I found any Seed or Berries on the dwarfish Sort
yet I find no Difference in Taste when Infusion is made Cattle and Sheep
delight in this Plant very much and so do the Deer all which
crop it very short and browze thereon wheresoever they meet with it
I have transplanted the SandBank and dwarfish Yaupon
and find that the first Year the Shrubs stood at a stand
but the second Year they throve as well as in their native Soil
This Plant is the Indian Tea usd and approvd by all the Savages
on the Coast of Carolina and from them sent to the Westward Indians
and sold at a considerable Price Curing the Yaupon
All which they cure after the same way as they do for themselves
which is thus They take this Plant not only the Leaves
but the smaller Twigs along with them and bruise it in a Mortar
till it becomes blackish the Leaf being wholly defaced
Then they take it out put it into one of their earthen Pots
which is over the Fire till it smoaks stirring it all the time
till it is curd Others take it after it is bruisd
and put it into a Bowl to which they put live Coals and cover them
with the Yaupon till they have done smoaking often turning them over
After all they spread it upon their Mats and dry it in the Sun
to keep for Use The Spaniards in NewSpain have this Plant
very plentifully on the Coast of Florida and hold it in great Esteem
Sometimes they cure it as the Indians do or else beat it to a Powder
so mix it as Coffee yet before they drink it they filter the same
They prefer it above all Liquids to drink with Physick to carry the same
safely and speedily thro the Passages for which it is admirable
as I myself have experimented

Timber
In the next Place I shall speak of the Timber that Carolina affords
which is as follows

ChesnutOak
ChesnutOak is a very lofty Tree clear of Boughs and Limbs
for fifty or 60 Foot They bear sometimes four or five Foot through
all clear Timber and are the largest Oaks we have
yielding the fairest Plank They grow chiefly in low Land
that is stiff and rich I have seen of them so high
that a good Gun could not reach a Turkey tho loaded with SwanShot
They are calld Chesnut because of the Largeness and Sweetness of the Acorns

Scaly Oaks
White Scalybark Oak This is used as the former in building
Sloops and Ships Tho it bears a large Acorn yet it never grows
to the Bulk and Height of the Chesnut Oak It is so calld
because of a scaly broken white Bark that covers this Tree
growing on dry Land

Red Oak
We have Red Oak sometimes in good Land very large and lofty
Tis a porous Wood and used to rive into Rails for Fences
Tis not very durable yet some use this as well as the two former
for Pipe and BarrelStaves It makes good Clapboards

Spanish Oak
Spanish Oak is free to rive bears a whitish smooth Bark
and rives very well into Clapboards It is accounted durable
therefore some use to build Vessels with it for the Sea
it proving well and durable These all bear good Mast for the Swine

Bastard Spanish
BastardSpanish is an Oak betwixt the Spanish and Red Oak
the chief Use is for Fencing and Clapboards It bears good Acorns

Black Oak
The next is Black Oak which is esteemd a durable Wood under Water
but sometimes it is used in Housework It bears a good Mast for Hogs

White Iron
White Iron or RingOak is so calld from the Durability and lasting Quality
of this Wood It chiefly grows on dry lean Land and seldom fails of bearing
a plentiful Crop of Acorns This Wood is found to be very durable
and is esteemd the best Oak for Shipwork that we have in Carolina
for tho Live Oak be more lasting yet it seldom allows Planks
of any considerable Length

Turkey Oak
TurkeyOak is so calld from a small Acorn it bears which the wild Turkeys
feed on

Live Oak
LiveOak chiefly grows on dry sandy Knolls This is an Evergreen
and the most durable Oak all America affords The Shortness
of this Woods Bowl or Trunk makes it unfit for Plank to build Ships withal
There are some few Trees that would allow a Stock of twelve Foot
but the Firmness and great Weight thereof frightens our Sawyers
from the Fatigue that attends the cutting of this Timber
A Nail once driven therein tis next to an Impossibility to draw it out
The Limbs thereof are so curd that they serve for excellent Timbers
Knees c for Vessels of any sort The Acorns thereof are as sweet
as Chesnuts and the Indians draw an Oil from them as sweet as that
from the Olive tho of an AmberColour With these Nuts or Acorns
some have counterfeited the Cocoa whereof they have made Chocolate
not to be distinguishd by a good Palate WindowFrames Mallets
and Pins for Blocks are made thereof to an excellent Purpose
I knew two Trees of this Wood among the Indians which were planted
from the Acorn and grew in the Freshes and never saw any thing
more beautiful of that kind They are of an indifferent quick Growth
of which there are two sorts The Acorns make very fine Pork

Willow Oak
WillowOak is a sort of WaterOak It grows in Ponds and Branches
and is useful for many things It is so calld from the Leaf
which very much resembles a Willow

Freshwater Oak
The Live Oak grows in the fresh Water Ponds and Swamps by the River sides
and in low Ground overflown with Water and is a perennial Green

Ash
Of Ash we have two sorts agreeing nearly with the English in the Grain
One of our sorts is tough like the English but differs something
in the Leaf and much more in the Bark Neither of them bears Keys
The WaterAsh is brittle The Bark is Food for the Bevers

Elm
There are two sorts of Elm the first grows on our HighLand
and approaches our English The Indians take the Bark of its Root
and beat it whilst green to a Pulp and then dry it in the Chimney
where it becomes of a reddish Colour This they use as a Sovereign Remedy
to heal a Cut or green Wound or any thing that is not corrupted
It is of a very glutinous Quality The other Elm grows in low Ground
of whose Bark the English and Indians make Ropes for as soon
as the Sap rises it strips off with the greatest ease imaginable
It runs in March or thereabouts

TulipTree
The TulipTrees which are by the Planters calld Poplars
as nearest approaching that Wood in Grain grow to a prodigious Bigness
some of them having been found One and twenty Foot in Circumference
I have been informd of a TulipTree that was ten Foot Diameter
and another wherein a lusty Man had his Bed and Houshold Furniture
and livd in it till his Labour got him a more fashionable Mansion
He afterwards became a noted Man in his Country for Wealth and Conduct
One of these sorts bears a white Tulip the other a partycolourd
mottled one The Wood makes very pretty Wainscot Shingles for Houses
and Planks for several Uses It is reckond very lasting
especially under Ground for MillWork The Buds made into an Ointment
cure Scalds Inflammations and Burns I saw several Bushels thereon
The Cattle are apt to eat of these Buds which give a very odd Taste
to the Milk

Beech
Beech is here frequent and very large The Grain seems exactly the same
as that in Europe We make little Use thereof save for FireWood
Tis not a durable Timber It affords a very sweet Nut
yet the Pork fed thereon tho sweet is very oily and ought to be
hardend with Indian Corn before it is killd Buck Beech
Another sort calld BuckBeech is here found

HornBeam
HornBeam grows in some Places very plentifully yet the Plenty
of other Wood makes it unregarded

Sassafras
The Vertues of Sassafras are well known in Europe This Wood
sometimes grows to be above two Foot over and is very durable and lasting
used for Bowls Timbers Posts for Houses and other Things that require
standing in the Ground Tis very light It bears a white Flower
which is very cleansing to the Blood being eaten in the Spring
with other Sallating The Berry when ripe is black tis very oily
Carminative and extremely prevalent in Clysters for the Colick
The Bark of the Root is a Specifick to those afflicted with the Gripes
The same in Powder and a Lotion made thereof is much used by the Savages
to mundify old Ulcers and for several other Uses being highly esteemd
among them

Dogwood
DogWood is plentiful on our light Land inclining to a rich Soil
It flowers the first in the Woods its white Blossom making the Forest
very beautiful It has a fine Grain and serves for several Uses
within doors but is not durable The Bark of this Root infused
is held an infallible Remedy against the Worms

Laurel
Laurel beforementiond as to its Bigness and Use I have seen Planks
sawn of this Wood but tis not found durable in the Weather
yet pretty enough for many other Uses

Bay and Laurel generally delight in a low swampy Ground I know no Use
they make of them but for FireWood excepting what I spoke of before
amongst the EverGreens

Evergreen
A famous EverGreen I must now mention which was forgotten amongst the rest
It is in Leaf like a Jessamine but larger and of a harder Nature
This grows up to a large Vine and twists itself round the Trees
it grows near making a very fine Shade I never saw any thing of that Nature
outdo it and if it be cut away close to the Ground it will presently
spring up again it being impossible to destroy it when once it has got Root
Tis an ornamental Plant and worth the Transplanting Its Seed
is a black Berry

TrumpetVine
The Scarlet TrumpetVine bears a glorious red Flower like a Bell or Trumpet
and makes a Shade inferiour to none that I ever saw yet it leaves us
when the Winter comes and remains naked till the next Spring
It bears a large Cod that holds its Seed

Maycock
The Maycock bears a glorious Flower and Apple of an agreeable Sweet
mixt with an acid Taste This is also a SummerVine

IndicoTrees
The Indico grows plentifully in our Quarters

BayTulips
The BayTulipTree is a fine Evergreen which grows frequently here

Sweet Gum
The sweet GumTree so calld because of the fragrant Gum it yields
in the Springtime upon Incision of the Bark or Wood It cures
the Herpes and Inflammations being applyd to the Morphew and Tettars
Tis an extraordinary Balsam and of great Value to those
who know how to use it No Wood has scarce a better Grain
whereof fine Tables Drawers and other Furniture might be made
Some of it is curiously curld It bears a round Bur with a sort of Prickle
which is the Seed

Black Gums
Of the Black Gum there grows with us two sorts both fit for CartNaves
The one bears a black welltasted Berry which the Indians mix
with their Pulse and Soups it giving em a pretty Flavour
and scarlet Colour The Bears crop these Trees for the Berries
which they mightily covet yet killd in that Season they eat very unsavory
which must be occasiond by this Fruit because at other times
when they feed on Mast BearsFlesh is a very welltasted Food
The other Gum bears a Berry in shape like the other
tho bitter and illtasted This Tree the Indians report
is never wounded by Lightning It has no certain Grain
and it is almost impossible to split or rive it

White Gum
The white Gum bearing a sort of long bunchd Flowers
is the most curled and knotted Wood I ever saw which would make
curious Furniture in case it was handled by a good Workman

Red Cedar
The red sort of Cedar is an Evergreen of which Carolina affords Plenty
That on the Salts grows generally on the Sandbanks and that in the Freshes
is found in the Swamps Of this Wood Tables Wainscot
and other Necessaries are made and esteemed for its sweet Smell
It is as durable a Wood as any we have therefore much used
in Posts for Houses and Sills likewise to build Sloops
Boats c by reason the Worm will not touch it for several Years
The Vessels built thereof are very durable and good Swimmers
Of this Cedar Shiploads may be exported It has been heretofore
so plentiful in this Settlement that they have fenced in Plantations with it
and the Coffins of the Dead are generally made thereof

White Cedar
White Cedar so calld because it nearly approaches the other Cedar
in Smell Bark and Leaf only this grows taller being as strait as an Arrow
It is extraordinary light and free to rive Tis good for Yard TopMasts
Booms and Boltsprits being very tough The best Shingles for Houses
are made of this Wood it being no Strain to the Roof and never rots
Good Pails and other Vessels free from Leakage are likewise made thereof
The Bark of this and the red Cedar the Indians use to make their Cabins of
which prove firm and resist all Weathers

Cypress
Cypress is not an Evergreen with us and is therefore calld
the bald Cypress because the Leaves during the WinterSeason turn red
not recovering their Verdure till the Spring These Trees are the largest
for Height and Thickness that we have in this Part of the World
some of them holding thirtysix Foot in Circumference Upon Incision
they yield a sweetsmelling Grain tho not in great Quantities and the Nuts
which these Trees bear plentifully yield a most odoriferous Balsam
that infallibly cures all new and green Wounds which the Inhabitants
are well acquainted withal Of these great Trees the Pereaugers and Canoes
are scoopd and made which sort of Vessels are chiefly
to pass over the Rivers Creeks and Bays and to transport Goods and Lumber
from one River to another Some are so large as to carry thirty Barrels
tho of one entire Piece of Timber Others that are split down the Bottom
and a piece added thereto will carry eighty or an hundred
Several have gone out of our Inlets on the Ocean to Virginia
laden with Pork and other Produce of the Country Of these Trees
curious Boats for Pleasure may be made and other necessary Craft
Some Years ago a foolish Man in Albemarl and his Son
had got one of these Canoes deckd She held as I take it sixteen Barrels
He brought her to the Collectors to be cleard for Barbados
but the Officer took him for a Man that had lost his Senses
and argud the Danger and Impossibility of performing such a Voyage
in a hollow Tree but the Fellow would hearken to no Advice of that kind
till the Gentleman told him if he did not value his own Life
he valud his Reputation and Honesty and so flatly refusd clearing him
Upon which the Canoe was sold and I think remains in being still
This Wood is very lasting and free from the Rot A Canoe of it
will outlast four Boats and seldom wants Repair They say
that a Chest made of this Wood will suffer no Moth or Vermine
to abide therein

Two sorts of Locust white and yellow is rare if varnishd
The Locust for its enduring the Weather is chosen for all sorts of Works
that are exposed thereto It bears a Leaf nearest the LiquoricePlant
Tis a pretty tall Tree Of this the Indians make their choicest Bows
it being very tough and flexible We have little or none of this Wood
in Pampticough

Honey Tree a Locust
The HoneyTree bears as great a Resemblance to the Locust
as a Shallot does to an Onion It is of that Species but more prickly
They bear a Cod one side whereof contains the Seed the other the Honey
They will bear in five Years from the Kernel They were first brought
by the Indian Traders and propagated by their Seed
at the Apamaticks in Virginia Last Year I planted the Seed
and had them sprung up before I came from thence which was in August
Of the Honey very good Metheglin is made there being Orchards
planted in Virginia for that intent

Sowr Wood
The Sorrel or SowrWoodTree is so calld because the Leaves
taste like Sorrel Some are about a Foot or ten Inches Diameter
I am unacquainted with its Vertues at present

Pine
Of Pines there are in Carolina at least four sorts The PitchPine
growing to a great Bigness most commonly has but a short Leaf
Its Wood being replete with abundance of Bitumen is so durable
that it seems to suffer no Decay tho exposed to all Weathers for many Ages
and is used in several Domestick and Plantation Uses This Tree affords
the four great Necessaries Pitch Tar Rozin and Turpentine
which two last are extracted by tapping and the Heat of the Sun
the other two by the Heat of the Fire

The white and yellow Pines are sawd into Planks for several Uses
They make Masts Yards and a great many other Necessaries therewith
the Pine being the most useful Tree in the Woods

The AlmondPine serves for Masts very well As for the DwarfPine
it is for Shew alone being an Evergreen as they all are

Hiccory the best Firewood
The Hiccory is of the Walnutkind and bears a Nut as they do
of which there are found three sorts The first is that
which we call the common white Hiccory It is not a durable Wood
for if cut down and exposed to the Weather it will be quite rotten
and spoild in three Years as will likewise the Beech of this Country
Hiccory Nuts have very hard Shells but excellent sweet Kernels
with which in a plentiful Year the old Hogs that can crack them
fatten themselves and make excellent Pork These Nuts are gotten
in great Quantities by the Savages and laid up for Stores
of which they make several Dishes and Banquets One of these
I cannot forbear mentioning it is this They take these Nuts
and break them very small betwixt two Stones till the Shells and Kernels
are indifferent small And this Powder you are presented withal
in their Cabins in little wooden Dishes the Kernel dissolves in your Mouth
and the Shell is spit out This tastes as well as any Almond
Another Dish is the Soup which they make of these Nuts beaten
and put into VenisonBroth which dissolves the Nut and thickens
whilst the Shell precipitates and remains at the bottom
This Broth tastes very rich Red Hiccory There is another sort
which we call red Hiccory the Heart thereof being very red
firm and durable of which WalkingSticks Mortars Pestils
and several other fine Turnerywares are made The third is calld
the Flyingbarkd Hiccory from its brittle and scaly Bark
It bears a Nut with a bitter Kernel and a soft Shell like a French Walnut
Of this Wood Coggs for Mills are made c The Leaves smell very fragrant

Walnut
The WalnutTree of America is calld Black Walnut I suppose
that Name was at first to distinguish it from the Hiccories
it having a blacker Bark This Tree grows in good Land
to a prodigious Bigness The Wood is very firm and durable
of which Tables and Chests of Drawers are made and prove very well
Some of this is very knotty which would make the best Returns for England
tho the Masters of Vessels refuse it not understanding its Goodness
Tis a very good and durable Wood to bottom Vessels for the Sea withal
and they say that it is never eaten by the Worm The Nuts have
a large Kernel which is very oily except lain by a long time to mellow
The Shell is very thick as all the native Nuts of America are
When it has its yellow outward Coat on it looks and smells much like a Lemon

Maple
The Maple of which we have two sorts is used to make Trenchers
Spinningwheels c withal

Chinkapin
Chinkapin is a sort of Chesnut whose Nuts are most commonly very plentiful
insomuch that the Hogs get fat with them They are rounder and smaller
than a Chesnut but much sweeter The Wood is much of the Nature of Chesnut
having a Leaf and Grain almost like it It is used to timber Boats
Shallops c and makes any thing that is to endure the Weather
This and the Hiccory are very tough Rods used to whip Horses withal
yet their Wood in Substance is very brittle This Tree
the Vine much delights to twist about Its good FireWood
but very sparkling as well as Sassafras

Birch
The Birch grows all on the Banks of our Rivers very high up
I never saw a Tree on the Salts It differs something in Bark
from the European Birch Its Buds in April are eaten by the Parrakeetos
which resort from all Parts at that Season to feed thereon
Where this Wood grows we are not yet seated and as to the Wine
or other Profits it would yield we are at present Strangers to

Willow
The Willow here likewise differs both in Bark and Leaf It is frequently
found on the Banks of fresh Water as the Birch is

Sycamore
The Sycamore in these Parts grows in a low swampy Land by Riversides
Its Bark is quite different from the English and the most beautiful
I ever saw being mottled and clowded with several Colours
as white blue c It bears no Keys but a Bur like the sweet Gum
Its Uses I am ignorant of

Aspin
I never saw any Aspin but in RapahannockRiver from whence I brought one
that was presented me there as a great Present but it died by the way

Holly
Of Holly we have two sorts one having a large Leaf the other a smaller
They grow very thick in our low Woods Many of them are very strait
and two Foot Diameter They make good Trenchers and other TurneryWare

RedBud
The RedBudTree bears a purple LarkHeel and is the best Sallad
of any Flower I ever saw It is ripe in April and May
They grow in Trees generally small but some are a Foot Diameter

Pelletory
Pelletory grows on the SandBanks and Islands It is used
to cure the Toothach by putting a Piece of the Bark in the Mouth
which being very hot draws a Rhume from the Mouth and causes much Spittle
The Indians use it to make their Composition which they give
to their young Men and Boys when they are husquenawd of which you shall
hear farther when I come to treat of the Customs c of that People

ArrowWood
ArrowWood growing on the Banks is used by the Indians
for Arrows and GunSticks It grows as strait as if plaind
and is of all Sizes Tis as tough and pliable as the smallest Canes

Chesnut
The ChesnutTree of Carolina grows up towards the hilly Part thereof
is a very large and durable Wood and fit for HouseFrames Palisados
Sills and many other Uses The Nut is smaller than those from Portugal
but sweeter

OakVine
This is no Tree but calld the OakVine by reason it bears a sort of Bur
as the Oak does and generally runs up those Trees Its so porous
that you suck Liquors thro a Length of two Foot

PricklyAsh grows up like a Pole of which the Indians and English
make Poles to set their Canoes along in ShoalWater Its very light
and full of Thorns or Prickles bearing Berries in large Clusters
of a purple Colour not much unlike the Alder The Root of this Tree
is Cathartick and Emetick used in Cachexies

Poison Vine
The Poison Vine is so called because it colours the Hands of those
who handle it What the Effects of it may be I cannot relate
neither do I believe that any has made an Experiment thereof
The Juice of this will stain Linnen never to wash out It marks
a blackish blue Colour which is done only by breaking a bit of the Vine off
and writing what you please therewith I have thought
that the EastIndia Natives set their Colours by some such Means
into their finest Callicoes It runs up any Tree it meets withal
and clasps round about it The Leaves are like Hemlock
and fall off in Winter

Canes and Reeds
Of Canes and Reeds we have many sorts The hollow Reed or Cane
such as AnglingRods are made of and Weavers use we have great Plenty of
though none to the Northward of JamesRiver in Virginia
They always grow in Branches and low Ground Their Leaves endure the Winter
in which Season our Cattle eat them greedily We have them
towards the Heads of our Rivers so large that one Joint will hold
above a pint of Liquor

Bamboo
The small Bamboo is next which is a certain Vine like the rest
of these Species growing in low Land They seldom with us
grow thicker than a Mans little Finger and are very tough
Their Root is a round Ball which the Indians boil as we do GardenRoots
and eat them When these Roots have been some time out of the Ground
they become hard and make good Heads to the Canes on which
several pretty Figures may be cut There are several others of this kind
not thoroughly discoverd

Palmeto
That Palmeto grows with us which we call the dwarfish sort
but the PalmetoTree I have not yet met withal in NorthCarolina
of which you have a Description elsewhere We shall next treat
of the Spontaneous Fruits of this Country and then proceed to those
that have been transplanted from Europe and other Parts

Natural Vines
Among the natural Fruits the Vine first takes place of which
I find six sorts very well known BunchGrapes The first
is the black BunchGrapes which yield a Crimson Juice
These grow common and bear plentifully They are of a good Relish
though not large yet well knit in the Clusters They have a thickish Skin
and large Stone which makes them not yield much Juice
There is another sort of BlackGrapes like the former in all respects
save that their Juice is of a light FleshColour inclining to a White
I once saw a Spontaneous white BunchGrape in Carolina
but the Cattle browzing on the Sprouts thereof in the Spring it died
FoxGrapes Of those which we call FoxGrapes we have four sorts
two whereof are called SummerGrapes because ripe in July
the other two WinterFruit because not ripe till September or October
The Summer FoxGrapes grow not in Clusters or great Bunches
but are about five or six in a Bunch about the Bigness of a Damson
or larger The black sort are frequent the white not so commonly found
They always grow in Swamps and low moist Lands running sometimes very high
and being shady and therefore proper for Arbours They afford
the largest Leaf I ever saw to my remembrance the Back of which
is of a white Horseflesh Colour This Fruit always ripens in the Shade
I have transplanted them into my Orchard and find they thrive well
if manured A Neighbour of mine has done the same mine were by Slips
his from the Roots which thrive to Admiration and bear Fruit
tho not so juicy as the European Grape but of a glutinous Nature
However it is pleasant enough to eat

The other Winter FoxGrapes are much of the same Bigness
These refuse no Ground swampy or dry but grow plentifully
on the SandHills along the SeaCoast and elsewhere and are great Bearers
I have seen near twelve Bushels upon one Vine of the black sort
Some of these when thoroughly ripe have a very pretty vinous Taste
and eat very well yet are glutinous The white sort
are clear and transparent and indifferent small Stones
Being removed by the Slip or Root they thrive well in our Gardens
and make pleasant Shades

Persimmons
Persimmon is a Tree that agrees with all Lands and Soils
Their Fruit when ripe is nearest our Medlar if eaten before
draws your Mouth up like a Purse being the greatest Astringent
I ever met withal therefore very useful in some Cases The Fruit if ripe
will presently cleanse a foul Wound but causes Pain The Fruit is rotten
when ripe and commonly contains four flat Kernels calld Stones
which is the Seed Tis said the Cortex Peruvianus comes
from a PersimmonTree that grows in NewSpain I have tryd
the Drying of this Bark to imitate it which it does tolerably well
and agrees therewith It is binding enough to work the same Effect
The Tree in extraordinary Land comes sometimes to two Foot Diameter
though not often There are two sorts of this Fruit one ripe in Summer
the other when the Frost visits us

Mulberry
We have three sorts of Mulberries besides the different Bigness
of some Trees Fruit The first is the common red Mulberry
whose Fruit is the earliest we have except the Strawberries and very sweet
These Trees make a very fine Shade to sit under in Summertime
They are found wild in great Quantities wherever the Land is light and rich
yet their Fruit is much better when they stand open They are used
instead of Raisins and Currants and make several pretty Kickshaws
They yield a transparent Crimson Liquor which would make good Wine
but few Peoples Inclinations in this Country tend that way
The others are a smoothleavd Mulberry fit for the SilkWorm
One bears a white Fruit which is common the other bears a small black Berry
very sweet They would persuade me there that the black Mulberry
with the SilkWorm smooth Leaf was a white Mulberry and changed its Fruit
The Wood hereof is very durable and where the Indians cannot get Locust
they make use of this to make their Bows This Tree grows
extraordinary round and pleasant to the Eye

The Hiccory Walnut Chinkapin and Chesnut with their Fruits
we have mentiond before

HazleNut
The HazleNut grows plentifully in some places of this Country
especially towards the Mountains but ours are not so good
as the English Nuts having a much thicker Shell like all
the Fruits of America that I ever met withal which in Hardness
exceeds those of Europe

BlackCherries
The Cherries of the Woods grow to be very large Trees One sort
which is rarely found is red and not much unlike the CornelBerry
But the common Cherry grows high and in Bunches like English Currants
but much larger They are of a bitterish sweet Relish
and are equally valuable with our small BlackCherries
for an Infusion in Spirits They yield a crimson Liquor
and are great Bearers

Rasberries
Our Rasberries are of a purple Colour and agreeable Relish
almost like the English but I reckon them not quite so rich
When once planted tis hard to root them out They run wild
all over the Country and will bear the same Year you transplant them
as I have found by Experience

Hurts
The Hurts HuckleBerries or Blues of this Country are four sorts
which we are well acquainted withal but more Species of this sort
and all others Time and Enquiry must discover The first sort is
the same Blue or Bilberry that grows plentifully in the North of England
and in other Places commonly on your Heaths Commons and Woods
where Brakes or Fern grows

The second sort grows on a small Bush in our Savannas and Meads
and in the Woods They are larger than the common Fruit
and have larger Seed

The third grows on the single Stem of a Stick that grows in low good Land
and on the Banks of Rivers They grow three or four Foot high
and are very pleasant like the first sort but larger

The fourth sort grows upon Trees some ten and twelve Foot high
and the Thickness of a Mans Arm these are found in the Runs and low Grounds
and are very pleasant and bear wonderfully The English sometimes
dry them in the Sun and keep them to use in the Winter
instead of Currants The Indians get many Bushels and dry them on Mats
whereof they make PlumBread and many other Eatables
They are good in Tarts or infused in Liquors

Piemento
In the same Ground commonly grows the Piemento or AllSpiceTree
whose Berries differ in shape from those in the WestIndies
being Taper or Conick yet not inferiour to any of that sort
This Tree grows much like the Hurts and is of the same Bigness
I have known it transplanted to high Land where it thrives

Dews BlackBerries
Our DewBerries are very good But the BlackBerries are bitterish
and not so palatable as in England

Sugar Tree
The SugarTree ought to have taken place before It is found
in no other parts of Carolina or America that I ever learnt
but in Places that are near the Mountains Its most like one sort of Maple
of any Tree and may be rankd amongst that kind This Tree
which I am told is of a very tedious Growth is found very plentifully
towards the Heads of some of our Rivers The Indians tap it
and make Gourds to receive the Liquor which Operation is done
at distinct and proper times when it best yields its Juice
of which when the Indians have gotten enough they carry it home
and boil it to a just Consistence of Sugar which grains of itself
and serves for the same Uses as other Sugar does

Papau
The Papau is not a large Tree I think I never saw one a Foot through
but has the broadest Leaf of any Tree in the Woods and bears an Apple
about the Bigness of a Hens Egg yellow soft and as sweet
as any thing can well be They make rare Puddings of this Fruit
The Apple contains a large Stone

Wild Fig
The wild Fig grows in Virginia up in the Mountains as I am informd
by a Gentleman of my acquaintance who is a Person of Credit
and a great Traveller in America I shall be glad to have an Opportunity
to make Tryal what Improvement might be made of this wild Fruit

Plum red
The wild Plums of America are of several sorts Those which I can give
an account of from my own Knowledge I will and leave the others
till a farther Discovery The most frequent is that which we call
the common Indian Plum of which there are two sorts if not more
One of these is ripe much sooner than the other and differs in the Bark
one of the Barks being very scaly like our American Birch
These Trees when in Blossom smell as sweet as any Jessamine
and look as white as a Sheet being something prickly You may make it grow
to what Shape you please they are very ornamental about a House
and make a wonderful fine Shew at a Distance in the Spring
because of their white Livery Their Fruit is red and very palatable
to the sick They are of a quick Growth and will bear from the Stone
in five Years on their Stock The English large black Plum thrives well
as does the Cherry being grafted thereon

Damsons of America
The American Damsons are both black and white and about the Bigness of
an European Damson They grow any where if planted from the Stone or Slip
bear a white Blossom and are a good Fruit They are found on the SandBanks
all along the Coast of America I have planted several in my Orchard
that came from the Stone which thrive well amongst the rest of my Trees
But they never grow to the Bigness of the other Trees now spoken of
These are plentiful Bearers

There is a third sort of Plum about the Bigness of the Damson
The Tree is taller seldom exceeding ten Inches in Thickness
The Plum seems to taste physically yet I never found any Operation it had
except to make their Lips sore that eat them The Wood is something porous
but exceeds any Box for a beautiful Yellow

Winter Currant
There is a very pretty bushy Tree about seven or eight Foot high
very spreading which bears a WinterFruit that is ripe in October
They call em Currants but they are nearer a Hurt I have eaten
very pretty Tarts made thereof They dry them instead of Currants
This Bush is very beautiful

Bermudas Currants
The Bermudas Currants grow in the Woods on a Bush much like
the European Currant Some People eat them very much but for my part
I can see nothing inviting in them and reckon them a very indifferent Fruit

April Currants
We have another Currant which grows on the Banks of Rivers
or where only Clay hath been thrown up This Fruit is red
and gone almost as soon as come They are a pretty Fruit
whilst they last and the Tree for tis not a Bush they grow upon
is a very pleasant Vegetable

Red Haws
The Hawthorn grows plentifully in some parts of this Country
The Haws are quite different from those in England being four times as big
and of a very pleasant agreeable Taste We make no use of this Plant
nor any other for Hedges because Timber is so plentiful at present
In my Judgment the HoneyLocust would be the fittest for Hedges
because it is very apt to shoot forth many Sprouts and Succours
from the Roots besides it is of a quick Growth and very prickly

BlackHaws
The Black Haw grows on a slender Tree about the Height of a QuinceTree
or something higher and bears the black Haw which People eat
and the Birds covet also What Vertues the Fruit or Wood is of
I cannot resolve you at present

Services
Thus have I given an Account of all the Spontaneous Fruits of Carolina
that have come to my Knowledge excepting Services which I have seen
in the Indians Hands and eat of them but never saw
how nor where they grew There may very well be expected
a great many more Fruits which are the natural Product of this Country
when we consider the Fruitfulness of the Soil and Climate
and account for the vast Tract of Land great part of which
is not yet found out according to the Product of that which
is already discoverd which as I once hinted before is not as yet
arrivd to our Knowledge we having very little or no Correspondence
amongst the mountainous Parts of this Province and towards
the Country of Messiasippi all which we have strange Accounts of
and some very large ones with respect to the different and noble Fruits
and several other Ornaments and Blessings of Nature which
Messiasippi possesses more to be coveted than any of those we enjoy
to the Eastward of the Mountains Yet when I came to discourse
some of the Idolizers of that Country I found it to be rather Novelty
than Truth and Reality that induced those Persons to allow it
such Excellencies above others It may be a brave and fertile Country
as I believe it is but I cannot be persuaded that it can be
near so advantageous as ours which is much better situated for Trade
being faced all along with the Ocean as the English America is
when the other is only a direct River in the midst of a wild unknown Land
greatest part of whose Product must be fetchd or brought a great way
before it can come to a Market Moreover such great Rivers
commonly allow of more Princes Territories than one and thus nothing
but War and Contention accompanies the Inhabitants thereof

But not to trouble our Readers with any more of this we will proceed
in the next place to shew what Exotick Fruits we have that thrive well
in Carolina and what others it may reasonably be supposd would do there
were they brought thither and planted In pursuance of which
I will set down a Catalogue of what Fruits we have I mean Species
For should I pretend to give a regular Name to every one
its neither possible for me to do it nor for any one to understand it
when done if we consider that the chiefest part of our Fruit came
from the Kernel and some others from the Succours or Sprouts of the Tree
First we will begin with Apples which are the

Apples
 Golden Russet
 Pearmain  Winter
  Summer
 HarveyApple I cannot tell whether the same as in England
 Winter Queening
 Leather Coat
 Juniting
 Codlin
 Redstreak
 Longstalk
 LadyFinger

The Golden Russet thrives well

The Pearmains of both sorts are apt to speck and rot on the Trees
and the Trees are damaged and cut off by the Worm which breeds in the Forks
and other parts thereof and often makes a Circumposition
by destroying the Bark round the Branches till it dies

HarveyApple that which we call so is esteemd very good to make Cider of

Winter Queening is a durable Apple and makes good Cider

LeatherCoat both Apple and Tree stand well

The Juniting is early ripe and soon gone in these warm Countries

Codlin no better and fairer Fruit in the World yet the Tree suffers
the same Distemper as the Pearmains or rather worse the Trees always dying
before they come to their Growth

The Redstreak thrives very well

Longstalk is a large Apple with a long Stalk and makes good Summer Cider

We beat the first of our Codlin Cider against reaping our Wheat
which is from the tenth of June to the five and twentieth

LadyFinger the long Apple the same as in England and full as good
We have innumerable sorts some calld RopeApples which are small Apples
hanging like Ropes of Onions Flattings Grigsons CheeseApples
and a great number of Names given according to every ones Discretion

Pears
The WardenPear here proves a good eating Pear and is not so long ripening
as in England

Katharine excellent

Sugarpear

And several others without Name The Bergamot we have not
nor either of the Bonne Chrestiennes though I hear they are all three
in Virginia Those sorts of Pears which we have are as well relisht
as ever I eat any where but that Fruit is of very short Continuance with us
for they are gone almost as soon as ripe

Quinces
I am not a Judge of the different sorts of Quinces which they call
Brunswick Portugal and Barbary But as to the Fruit in general
I believe no Place has fairer and better relisht They are very pleasant
eaten raw Of this Fruit they make a Wine or Liquor
which they call QuinceDrink and which I approve of beyond any Drink
which that Country affords though a great deal of Cider and some Perry
is there made The QuinceDrink most commonly purges those
that first drink it and cleanses the Body very well
The Argument of the Physicians that they bind People is hereby contradicted
unless we allow the Quinces to differ in the two Countries
The least Slip of this Tree stuck in the Ground comes to bear in three years

Peaches
All Peaches with us are standing neither have we any WallFruit
in Carolina for we have Heat enough and therefore do not require it
We have a great many sorts of this Fruit which all thrive to Admiration
PeachTrees coming to Perfection with us as easily as the Weeds
A Peach falling on the Ground brings a PeachTree that shall bear
in three years or sometimes sooner Eating Peaches in our Orchards
makes them come up so thick from the Kernel that we are forced
to take a great deal of Care to weed them out otherwise they make our Land
a Wilderness of PeachTrees They generally bear so full
that they break great part of their Limbs down We have likewise
very fair Nectarines especially the red that clings to the Stone
the other yellow Fruit that leaves the Stone of the last
I have a Tree that most Years brings me fifteen or twenty Bushels
I see no Foreign Fruit like this for thriving in all sorts of Land
and bearing its Fruit to Admiration I want to be satisfyd about
one sort of this Fruit which the Indians claim as their own and affirm
they had it growing amongst them before any Europeans came to America
The Fruit I will describe as exactly as I can The Tree grows very large
most commonly as big as a handsome Appletree the Flowers are of a reddish
murrey Colour the Fruit is rather more downy than the yellow Peach
and commonly very large and soft being very full of Juice
They part freely from the Stone and the Stone is much thicker
than all the other Peach Stones we have which seems to me
that it is a Spontaneous Fruit of America yet in those Parts of America
that we inhabit I never could hear that any PeachTrees were ever found
growing in the Woods neither have the foreign Indians that live remote
from the English any other sort And those living amongst us
have a hundred of this sort for one other they are a hardy Fruit
and are seldom damaged by the NorthEast Blasts as others are
Of this sort we make Vinegar wherefore we call them VinegarPeaches
and sometimes IndianPeaches

Apricock
This Tree grows to a vast Bigness exceeding most AppleTrees
They bear well tho sometimes an early Spring comes on in February
and perhaps when the Tree is fully blown the Cloudy NorthEastWinds
which attend the end of that Month or the beginning of March
destroy most of the Fruit The biggest ApricockTree I ever saw
as they told me was grafted on a PeachStock in the Ground
I know of no other sort with us than the Common We generally
raise this Fruit from the Stone which never fails to bring the same Fruit
Likewise our PeachStones effect the same without so much as once missing
to produce the same sort that the Stone came from

Plum
Damson Damazeen and a large round black Plum are all I have met withal
in Carolina They thrive well enough the last to Admiration
and becomes a very large Tree if in stiff Ground otherwise they will not
do well

Figs
Of Figs we have two sorts One is the low BushFig which bears a large Fruit
If the Winter happens to have much Frost the tops thereof die
and in the Spring sprout again and bear two or three good Crops

The TreeFig is a lesser Fig though very sweet The Tree grows
to a large Body and Shade and generally brings a good Burden
especially if in light Land This Tree thrives no where better
than on the SandBanks by the Sea

Cherries
We have the common red and black Cherry which bear well
I never saw any grafted in this Country the common excepted
which was grafted on an Indian Plumstock and bore well
This is a good way because our common CherryTrees are very apt
to put Scions all round the Tree for a great Distance which must needs be
prejudicial to the Tree and Fruit Not only our Cherries are apt to do so
but our Apples and most other FruitTrees which may chiefly be imputed
to the Negligence and Unskilfulness of the Gardener Our Cherries are ripe
a Month sooner than in Virginia

Goosberry
Goosberries I have seen of the smaller sort but find they do not do so well
as in England and to the Northward Want of Dressing may be
some Reason for this

Currants
Currants White Red and Black thrive here as well as any where

Rasps
Rasberries the red and white I never saw any Trial made of
But there is no doubt of their thriving to Admiration
since those of the Country do so well

Mulberry
The Mulberries are spontaneous We have no others than what I have
already mentioned in the Class of Natural Fruits of Carolina

Barberry
Barberry red with Stones and without Stones grow here

Strawberry
Strawberries not Foreign but those of the Country grow here
in great Plenty Last April I planted a Bed of two hundred Foot in Length
which bore the same Year

Medlar
Medlars we have none

Walnut
All sorts of Walnuts from England France and Maderas
thrive well from the Nut

Filbert
No Filberts but HazleNuts the FilbertNut planted
becomes a good HazleNut and no better

Vines
As for that noble Vegetable the Vine without doubt it may
in this Country be improved and brought to the same Perfection
as it is at this Day in the same Latitude in Europe
since the chiefest part of this Country is a deep rich black Mould
which is up towards the Freshes and Heads of our Rivers
being very rich and mixd with Flint Pebbles and other Stones
And this sort of Soil is approvd of by all knowing Gardeners and Vigneroons
as a proper Earth in which the Grape chiefly delights and what seems
to give a farther Confirmation hereof is that the largest Vines
that were ever discoverd to grow wild are found in those Parts
oftentimes in such Plenty and are so interwoven with one another
that tis impossible to pass through them Moreover in these Freshes
towards the Hills the Vines are above five times bigger than those
generally with us who are seated in the Frontparts of this Country
adjoining to the Salts Of the wild Vines which are most of them
great Bearers some Wine has been made which I drank of
It was very strong and well relisht but what detains them all from offering
at great quantities they add that this Grape has a large Stone
and a thick Skin and consequently yields but a small Quantity of Wine
Some Essays of this Nature have been made by that Honourable Knight
Sir Nathanael Johnson in South Carolina who as I am informd
has rejected all Exotick Vines and makes his Wine from the natural
black Grape of Carolina by grafting it upon its own Stock
What Improvement this may arrive to I cannot tell but in other Species
I own Grafting and Imbudding yields speedy Fruit tho I never found
that it made them better

New planted Colonies are generally attended with a Force and Necessity
of Planting the known and approved Staple and Product of the Country
as well as all the Provisions their Families spend Therefore we
can entertain but small hopes of the Improvement of the Vine
till some skilful in dressing Vines shall appear amongst us
and go about it with a Resolution that Ordering the Vineyard
shall be one half of their Employment If this be begun and carried on
with that Assiduity and Resolution which it requires
then we may reasonably hope to see this a WineCountry
for then when it becomes a general Undertaking every one will be capable
to add something to the common Stock of that which he has gaind
by his own Experience This way would soon make the Burden light
and a great many shorter and exacter Curiosities and real Truths
would be found out in a short time The trimming of Vines
as they do in France that is to a Stump must either here be not followd
or we are not sensible of the exact time when they ought to be thus pruned
for Experience has taught us that the European Grape
sufferd to run and expand itself at large has been found to bear
as well in America as it does in Europe when at the same time
the same sort of Vine trimmd to a Stump as before spoken of
has born a poor Crop for one Year or two and by its spilling after cutting
emaciated and in three or four Years died This Experiment I believe
has never faild for I have trimmd the natural Vine the French way
which has been attended at last with the same Fate Wherefore it seems
most expedient to leave the Vines more Branches here than in Europe
or let them run up Trees as some do in Lombardy upon Elms
The Mulberries and Chinkapin are tough and trimmd to what you please
therefore fit Supporters of the Vines Gelding and plucking away the Leaves
to hasten the ripening of this Fruit may not be unnecessary
yet we see the natural wild Grape generally ripens in the Shade
Nature in this and many others may prove a sure Guide
The Twisting of the Stems to make the Grapes ripe together
loses no Juice and may be beneficial if done in Season
A very ingenious French Gentleman and another from Switzerland
with whom I frequently converse exclaim against that strict cutting of Vines
the generally approved Method of France and Germany and say
that they were both out in their Judgment till of late Experience has
taught them otherwise Moreover the French in North Carolina assure me
that if we should trim our Apple and other FruitTrees
as they do in Europe we should spoil them As for Apples and Plums
I have found by Experience what they affirm to be true The French
from the Mannakin Town on the Freshes of James River in Virginia
had for the most part removed themselves to Carolina to live there
before I came away and the rest were following as their Minister
Monsieur Philip de Rixbourg told me who was at BathTown
when I was taking my leave of my Friends He assurd me that their Intent
was to propagate Vines as far as their present Circumstances would permit
provided they could get any Slips of Vines that would do At the same time
I had gotten some GrapeSeed which was of the Jesuits white Grape
from Madera The Seed came up very plentifully and I hope
will not degenerate which if it happens not to do the Seed may prove
the best way to raise a Vineyard as certainly it is most easy
for Transportation Yet I reckon we should have our Seed from a Country
where the Grape arrives to the utmost Perfection of Ripeness
These French Refugees have had small Encouragement in Virginia
because at their first coming over they took their Measures of Living
from Europe which was all wrong for the small Quantities of ten
fifteen and twenty Acres to a Family did not hold out according to
their way of Reckoning by Reason they made very little or no Fodder
and the Winter there being much harder than with us their Cattle faild
chiefly because the English took up and surveyd all the Land
round about them so that they were hemmd in on all Hands
from providing more Land for themselves or their Children
all which is highly prejudicial in America where the generality
are bred up to Planting One of these French Men being a Fowling
shot a Fowl in the River upon which his Dog went down the Bank
to bring it to his Master but the Bank was so high and steep
that he could not get up again Thereupon the French Man went down
to help his Dog up and breaking the Mould away accidentally with his Feet
he discoverd a very rich CoalMine This Adventure he gave an Account of
amongst the Neighbourhood and presently one of the Gentlemen of that Part
surveyd the Land and the poor French Man got nothing by his Discovery
The French are good Neighbours amongst us and give Examples of Industry
which is much wanted in this Country They make good Flax Hemp
LinnenCloth and Thread which they exchange amongst the Neighbourhood
for other Commodities for which they have occasion

We have hitherto made no Tryal of foreign Herbage but doubtless
it would thrive well especially Sanfoin and those Grasses
that endure Heat and dry Grounds As for our Low Lands such as Marshes
Savannas and PercoarsonGround which lies low all of them naturally afford
good Land for Pasturage

We will next treat of the Beasts which you shall have an Account of
as they have been discoverd



 The Beasts of Carolina are the

 Buffelo or wild Beef
 Bear
 Panther
 Catamount
 Wild Cat
 Wolf
 Tyger
 Polcat
 Otter
 Bever
 MuskRat
 Possum
 Raccoon
 Minx
 WaterRat
 Rabbet two sorts
 Elks
 Stags
 FallowDeer
 Squirrel four sorts
 Fox
 Lion and Jackall on the Lake
 Rats two sorts
 Mice two sorts
 Moles
 Weasel Dormouse
 Bearmouse


The Buffelo is a wild Beast of America which has a Bunch on his Back
as the Cattle of St Laurence are said to have He seldom appears
amongst the English Inhabitants his chief Haunt being
in the Land of Messiasippi which is for the most part a plain Country
yet I have known some killd on the Hilly Part of CapeFairRiver
they passing the Ledges of vast Mountains from the said Messiasippi
before they can come near us Two killed one year in Virginia
at Appamaticks I have eaten of their Meat but do not think it so good
as our Beef yet the younger Calves are cryd up for excellent Food
as very likely they may be It is conjectured that these Buffelos
mixt in Breed with our tame Cattle would much better the Breed
for Largeness and Milk which seems very probable Of the wild Bulls Skin
Buff is made The Indians cut the Skins into Quarters
for the Ease of their Transportation and make Beds to lie on
They spin the Hair into Garters Girdles Sashes and the like
it being long and curled and often of a chesnut or red Colour
These Monsters are found to weigh as I am informed by a Traveller of Credit
from 1600 to 2400 Weight

Bear
The Bears here are very common though not so large as in Greenland
and the more Northern Countries of Russia The Flesh of this Beast
is very good and nourishing and not inferiour to the best Pork in Taste
It stands betwixt Beef and Pork and the young Cubs are a Dish
for the greatest Epicure living I prefer their Flesh before any Beef
Veal Pork or Mutton and they look as well as they eat
their fat being as white as Snow and the sweetest of any Creatures
in the World If a Man drink a Quart thereof melted
it never will rise in his Stomach We prefer it above all things
to fry Fish and other things in Those that are Strangers to it
may judge otherwise But I who have eaten a great deal of Bears Flesh
in my Lifetime since my being an Inhabitant in America
do think it equalizes if not excels any Meat I ever eat in Europe
The Bacon made thereof is extraordinary Meat but it must be well saved
otherwise it will rust This Creature feeds upon all sorts of wild Fruits
When Herrings run which is in March the Flesh of such of those Bears
as eat thereof is nought all that Season and eats filthily
Neither is it good when he feeds on Gumberries as I intimated before
They are great Devourers of Acorns and oftentimes meet the Swine
in the Woods which they kill and eat especially when they are hungry
and can find no other Food Now and then they get into
the Fields of Indian Corn or Maiz where they make a sad Havock
spoiling ten times as much as they eat The Potatos of this Country
are so agreeable to them that they never fail to sweep em all clean
if they chance to come in their way They are seemingly
a very clumsy Creature yet are very nimble in running up Trees
and traversing every Limb thereof When they come down
they run Tail foremost At catching of Herrings they are
most expert Fishers They sit by the Creeksides which are very narrow
where the Fish run in and there they take them up as fast as its possible
they can dip their Paws into the Water There is one thing more
to be considerd of this Creature which is that no Man
either Christian or Indian has ever killd a Shebear with Young

It is supposed that the SheBears after Conception hide themselves
in some secret and undiscoverable Place till they bring forth their Young
which in all Probability cannot be long otherwise the Indians
who hunt the Woods like Dogs would at some time or other
have found them out BearHunting is a great Sport in America
both with the English and Indians Some Years ago there were killd
five hundred Bears in two Counties of Virginia in one Winter
and but two SheBears amongst them all which were not with Young
as I told you of the rest The English have a breed of Dogs
fit for this sport about the size of Farmers Curs and by Practice
come to know the Scent of a Bear which as soon as they have found
they run him by the Nose till they come up with him
and then bark and snap at him till he trees when the Huntsman shoots him
out of the Trees there being for the most part two or three with Guns
lest the first should miss or not quite kill him Though they are not
naturally voracious yet they are very fierce when wounded
The Dogs often bring him to a Bay when wounded and then the Huntsmen
make other Shots perhaps with the Pistols that are stuck in their Girdles
If a Dog is apt to fasten and run into a Bear he is not good
for the best Dog in Europe is nothing in their Paws but if ever
they get him in their Clutches they blow his Skin from his Flesh
like a Bladder and often kill him or if he recovers it he is never good
for any thing after As the Paws of this Creature are held for the best bit
about him so is the Head esteemd the worst and always thrown away
for what reason I know not I believe none ever made Trial thereof
to know how it eats The Oil of the Bear is very Sovereign for Strains
Aches and old Pains The fine Fur at the bottom of the Belly is used
for making Hats in some places The Fur itself is fit for several Uses
as for making Muffs facing Caps c but the black Cubskin is preferable
to all sorts of that kind for Muffs Its Grain is like HogSkin

Panther
The Panther is of the Cats kind about the height of a very large Greyhound
of a reddish Colour the same as a Lion He climbs Trees
with the greatest Agility imaginable is very stronglimbd
catching a piece of Meat from any Creature he strikes at
His Tail is exceeding long his Eyes look very fierce and lively
are large and of a grayish Colour his Prey is Swinesflesh Deer
or any thing he can take no Creature is so nice and clean as this
in his Food When he has got his Prey he fills his Belly with the Slaughter
and carefully lays up the Remainder covering it very neatly with Leaves
which if any thing touches he never eats any more of it
He purrs as Cats do if taken when Young is never to be reclaimd
from his wild Nature He hollows like a Man in the Woods when killd
which is by making him take a Tree as the least Cur will presently do
then the Huntsmen shoot him if they do not kill him outright
he is a dangerous Enemy when wounded especially to the Dogs
that approach him This Beast is the greatest Enemy to the Planter
of any Vermine in Carolina His Flesh looks as well
as any ShamblesMeat whatsoever a great many People eat him as choice Food
but I never tasted of a Panther so cannot commend the Meat
by my own Experience His Skin is a warm Covering for the Indians
in Winter though not esteemd amongst the choice Furs This Skin dressd
makes fine Womens Shooes or Mens Gloves

CataMount
The MountainCat so calld because he lives in the Mountainous Parts
of America He is a Beast of Prey as the Panther is and nearest to him
in Bigness and Nature

Wild Cat
This Cat is quite different from those in Europe being more
nimble and fierce and larger his Tail does not exceed four Inches
He makes a very odd sort of Cry in the Woods in the Night
He is spotted as the Leopard is tho some of them are not
which may happen when their Furs are out of Season
he climbs a Tree very dexterously and preys as the Panther does
He is a great Destroyer of young Swine I knew an Island
which was possessd by these Vermine unknown to the Planter
who put thereon a considerable Stock of Swine but never took one back
for the wild Cats destroyd them all He takes most of his Prey by Surprize
getting up the Trees which they pass by or under and thence leaping
directly upon them Thus he takes Deer which he cannot catch by running
and fastens his Teeth into their Shoulders and sucks them
They run with him till they fall down for want of strength
and become a Prey to the Enemy Hares Birds and all he meets
that he can conquer he destroys The Fur is approvd to wear
as a Stomacher for weak and cold Stomachs They are likewise used
to line Muffs and Coats withal in cold Climates

Wolf
The Wolf of Carolina is the Dog of the Woods The Indians had
no other Curs before the Christians came amongst them
They are made domestick When wild they are neither so large nor fierce
as the European Wolf They are not Manslayers neither is any Creature
in Carolina unless wounded They go in great Droves in the Night
to hunt Deer which they do as well as the best Pack of Hounds
Nay one of these will hunt down a Deer They are often so poor
that they can hardly run When they catch no Prey they go to a Swamp
and fill their Belly full of Mud if afterwards they chance
to get any thing of Flesh they will disgorge the Mud and eat the other
When they hunt in the Night that there is a great many together
they make the most hideous and frightful Noise that ever was heard
The Fur makes good Muffs The Skin dressd to a Parchment
makes the best DrumHeads and if tannd makes the best sort of Shooes
for the SummerCountries

Tyger
Tygers are never met withal in the Settlement but are more to the Westward
and are not numerous on this Side the Chain of Mountains I once saw one
that was larger that a Panther and seemd to be a very bold Creature
The Indians that hunt in those Quarters say they are seldom met withal
It seems to differ from the Tyger of Asia and Africa

Polcat
Polcats or Skunks in America are different from those in Europe
They are thicker and of a great many Colours not all alike
but each differing from another in the particular Colour
They smell like a Fox but ten times stronger When a Dog encounters them
they piss upon him and he will not be sweet again in a Fortnight or more
The Indians love to eat their Flesh which has no manner of ill Smell
when the Bladder is out I know no use their Furs are put to
They are easily brought up tame

Otters
There have been seen some Otters from the Westward of Carolina
which were of a white Colour a little inclining to a yellow
They live on the same Prey here as in Europe and are the same
in all other Respects so I shall insist no farther on that Creature
Their Furs if black are valuable

Bevers
Bevers are very numerous in Carolina their being abundance of their Dams
in all Parts of the Country where I have traveld They are the most
industrious and greatest Artificers in building their Dams and Houses
of any fourfooted Creatures in the World Their Food is chiefly
the Barks of Trees and Shrubs viz Sassafras Ash SweetGum
and several others If you take them young they become
very tame and domestick but are very mischievous in spoiling Orchards
by breaking the Trees and blocking up your Doors in the Night
with the Sticks and Wood they bring thither If they eat any thing
that is salt it kills them Their Flesh is a sweet Food
especially their Tail which is held very dainty Their ForeFeet are open
like a Dogs their HindFeet webbd like a WaterFowls
The Skins are good Furs for several Uses which every one knows
The Leather is very thick I have known Shooes made thereof in Carolina
which lasted well It makes the best Hedgers Mittens that can be used

Musk Rat
Musk Rats frequent fresh Streams and no other as the Bever does
He has a Cod of Musk which is valuable as is likewise his Fur

Possum
The Possum is found no where but in America He is the Wonder
of all the Land Animals being the size of a Badger and near that Colour
The Males Pizzle is placed retrograde and in time of Coition
they differ from all other Animals turning Tail to Tail
as Dog and Bitch when tyd The Female doubtless breeds her Young
at her Teats for I have seen them stick fast thereto when they have been
no bigger than a small Rasberry and seemingly inanimate
She has a Paunch or false Belly wherein she carries her Young
after they are from those Teats till they can shift for themselves
Their Food is Roots Poultry or wild Fruits They have no Hair
on their Tails but a sort of a Scale or hard Crust as the Bevers have
If a Cat has nine Lives this Creature surely has nineteen
for if you break every Bone in their Skin and mash their Skull
leaving them for Dead you may come an hour after and they will be
gone quite away or perhaps you meet them creeping away
They are a very stupid Creature utterly neglecting their Safety
They are most like Rats of any thing I have for Necessity
in the Wilderness eaten of them Their Flesh is very white
and well tasted but their ugly Tails put me out of Conceit with that Fare
They climb Trees as the Raccoons do Their Fur is not esteemd nor used
save that the Indians spin it into Girdles and Garters

Raccoon
The Raccoon is of a darkgray Colour if taken young is easily made tame
but is the drunkenest Creature living if he can get any Liquor
that is sweet and strong They are rather more unlucky than a Monkey
When wild they are very subtle in catching their Prey
Those that live in the SaltWater feed much on Oysters which they love
They watch the Oyster when it opens and nimbly put in their Paw
and pluck out the Fish Sometimes the Oyster shuts and holds fast their Paw
till the Tide comes in that they are drownd tho they swim very well
The way that this Animal catches Crabs which he greatly admires
and which are plenty in Carolina is worthy of Remark
When he intends to make a Prey of these Fish he goes to a Marsh
where standing on the Land he lets his Tail hang in the Water
This the Crab takes for a Bait and fastens his Claws therein
which as soon as the Raccoon perceives he of a sudden springs forward
a considerable way on the Land and brings the Crab along with him
As soon as the Fish finds himself out of his Element he presently
lets go his hold and then the Raccoon encounters him by getting him
crosswise in his Mouth and devours him There is a sort of small LandCrab
which we call a Fiddler that runs into a Hole when any thing pursues him
This Crab the Raccoon takes by putting his ForeFoot in the Hole
and pulling him out With a tame Raccoon this Sport is very diverting
The Chief of his other Food is all sorts of wild Fruits green Corn
and such as the Bear delights in This and the Possum
are much of a Bigness The Fur makes good Hats and Linings
The Skin dressd makes fine Womens Shooes

Minx
The Minx is an Animal much like the English Fillimart or Polcat
He is long slender and every way shapd like him His Haunts are chiefly
in the Marshes by the Seaside and SaltWaters where he lives on Fish Fowl
Mice and Insects They are bold Thieves and will steal any thing from you
in the Night when asleep as I can tell by Experience for one Winter
by Misfortune I ran my Vessel aground and went often to the Banks
to kill wild Fowl which we did a great many One Night we had a mind
to sleep on the Banks the Weather being fair and wrapt up the Geese
which we had killd and not eaten very carefully in the Sail of a Canoe
and folded it several Doubles and for their better Security
laid em all Night under my Head In the Morning when I wakd
a Minx had eaten thro every Fold of the Canoes Sail
and thro one of the Geese most part of which was gone
These are likewise found high up in the Rivers in whose sides they live
which is known by the abundance of FreshWater MuscleShells
such as you have in England that lie at the Mouth of their Holes
This is an Enemy to the Tortois whose Holes in the Sand
where they hide their Eggs the Minx finds out and scratches up and eats
The Raccoons and Crows do the same The Minx may be made domestick
and were it not for his paying a Visit now and then to the Poultry
they are the greatest Destroyers of Rats and Mice that are in the World
Their Skins if good of that kind are valuable provided they are killd
in Season

WaterRats
The WaterRat is found here the same as in England The WaterSnakes
are often found to have of these Rats in their Bellies

Coneys
That which the People of Carolina call a Hare is nothing but a HedgeConey
They never borough in the Ground but much frequent Marshes and MeadowLand
They hide their Young in some Place secure from the Discovery of the Buck
as the European Rabbets do and are of the same Colour
but if you start one of them and pursue her she takes into a hollow Tree
and there runs up as far as she can in which Case the Hunter makes a Fire
and smoaks the Tree which brings her down and smothers her
At one time of the Year great Bots or Maggots breed betwixt
the Skin and the Flesh of these Creatures They eat just as
the English ones do but I never saw one of them fat We fire the Marshes
and then kill abundance

Rabbet English
The English or European Coneys are here found tho but in one place
that I ever knew of which was in TrentRiver where they boroughd
among the Rocks I cannot believe these are Natives of the Country
any otherwise than that they might come from aboard some Wreck
the Sea not being far off I was told of several that were upon
Bodies Island by Ronoak which came from that Ship of Bodies
but I never saw any However the Banks are no proper Abode of Safety
because of the many Minxes in those Quarters I carried over
some of the tame sort from England to SouthCarolina
which bred three times going over we having a long Passage
I turnd them loose in a Plantation and the young ones
and some of the old ones bred great Maggots in their Testicles At last
the great Gust in September 1700 brought a great deal of Rain
and drownd them all in their Holes I intend to make a second Tryal of them
in North Carolina and doubt not but to secure them

Elks
The Elk is a Monster of the Venison sort His Skin is used
almost in the same Nature as the Buffelos Some take him
for the red Deer of America but he is not For if brought and kept
in Company with one of that sort of the contrary Sex he will never couple
His Flesh is not so sweet as the lesser Deers His Horns exceed in Weight
all Creatures which the new World affords They will often resort and feed
with the Buffelo delighting in the same Range as they do

Stags
The Stags of Carolina are lodgd in the Mountains They are not so large
as in Europe but much larger than any FallowDeer They are always fat
I believe with some delicate Herbage that grows on the Hills
for we find all Creatures that graze much fatter and better Meat on the Hills
than those in the Valleys I mean towards and near the Sea
Some Deer on these Mountains afford the occidental Bezoar
not coming from a Goat as some report What sort of Beast affords
the oriental Bezoar I know not The Tallow of the Harts
make incomparable Candles Their Horns and Hides are of the same Value
as others of their kind

FallowDeer
FallowDeer in Carolina are taller and longerleggd than in Europe
but neither run so fast nor are so well haunchd Their Singles are
much longer and their Horns stand forward as the others incline backward
neither do they beam or bear their Antlers as the English Deer do
Towards the Salts they are not generally so fat and good Meat
as on the Hills I have known some killd on the Salts in January
that have had abundance of Bots in their Throat which keep them very poor
As the Summer approaches these Bots come out and turn into
the finest Butterfly imaginable being very large and having black white
and yellow Stripes DeerSkins are one of the best Commodities
Carolina affords to ship off for England provided they be large

Fox Squirrel
Of Squirrels we have four Sorts The first is the FoxSquirrel
so calld because of his large Size which is the Bigness of a Rabbet
of two or three Months old His Colour is commonly gray
yet I have seen several pied ones and some reddish and black
his chiefest Haunts are in the Piny Land where the AlmondPine grows
There he provides his WinterStore they being a Nut
that never fails of bearing He may be made tame and is very good Meat
when killed

Small gray Squirrel
The next sort of Squirrel is much of the Nature of the English
only differing in Colour Their Food is Nuts of all sorts
the Country affords and Acorns They eat well and like the Bear
are never found with young

FlyingSquirrel
This Squirrel is gray as well as the others He is the least of the Three
His Food is much the same with the small gray Squirrels He has not Wings
as Birds or Bats have there being a fine thin Skin coverd with Hair
as the rest of the parts are This is from the ForeFeet to the HinderFeet
which is extended and holds so much Air as buoys him up
from one Tree to another that are greater distances asunder
than other Squirrels can reach by jumping or springing He is made very tame
is an Enemy to a Cornfield as all Squirrels are and eats only
the germinating Eye of that Grain which is very sweet

Ground Squirrel
Ground Squirrels are so calld because they never delight
in running up Trees and leaping from Tree to Tree They are
the smallest of all Squirrels Their Tail is neither so long not bushy
but flattish They are of a reddish Colour and striped down each Side
with black Rows which make them very beautiful They may be kept tame
in a little Box with Cotton They and the FlyingSquirrels seldom stir out
in Cold Weather being tender Animals

Fox
The Fox of Carolina is gray but smells not as the Foxes
in GreatBritain and elsewhere They have reddish Hair about their Ears
and are generally very fat yet I never saw any one eat them
When hunted they make a sorry Chace because they run up Trees when pursued
They are never to be made familiar and tame as the Raccoon is
Their Furs if in Season are used for Muffs and other Ornaments
They live chiefly on Birds and Fowls and such small Prey

Supposed Lion and Jackall
I have been informd by the Indians that on a Lake of Water
towards the Head of Neus River there haunts a Creature
which frightens them all from Hunting thereabouts They say
he is the Colour of a Panther but cannot run up Trees
and that there abides with him a Creature like an Englishmans Dog
which runs faster than he can and gets his Prey for him They add
that there is no other of that Kind that ever they met withal
and that they have no other way to avoid him but by running up a Tree
The Certainty of this I cannot affirm by my own Knowledge
yet they all agree in this Story As for Lions I never saw any in America
neither can I imagine how they should come there

Rats
Of Rats we have two sorts the HouseRat as in Europe and the MarshRat
which differs very much from the other being more hairy
and has several other Distinctions too long here to name

Mice
Mice are the same here as those in England that belong to the House
There is one sort that poisons a Cat as soon as she eats of them
which has sometimes happend These Mice resort not to Houses

Dormouse
The Dormouse is the same as in England and so is the Weasel
which is very scarce

Rearmouse
The Bat or Rearmouse the same as in England The Indian Children
are much addicted to eat Dirt and so are some of the Christians
But roast a Bat on a Skewer then pull the Skin off and make the Child
that eats Dirt eat the roasted Rearmouse and he will never eat Dirt again
This is held as an infallible Remedy I have put this amongst the Beasts
as partaking of both Natures of the Bird and MouseKind

Having mentiond all the sorts of terrestrial or LandAnimals
which Carolina affords and are yet known to us except the Tame
and Domestick Creatures of which I shall give an Account hereafter
when I come to treat of the Ways and Manners of Agriculture in that Province
I shall now proceed to the known Insects of that Place
Not that I pretend to give an ample Account of the whole Tribe
which is too numerous and contains too great a Diversity of Species
many not yet discovered and others that have slipt my Memory at present
But those which I can remember I here present my Readers withal



 Insects of Carolina

Strange Genitors
The Allegator is the same as the Crocodile and differs only in Name
They frequent the sides of Rivers in the Banks of which they make
their Dwellings a great way under Ground the Hole or Mouth of their Dens
lying commonly two Foot under Water after which it rises
till it be considerably above the Surface thereof Here it is
that this amphibious Monster dwells all the Winter sleeping away his time
till the Spring appears when he comes from his Cave and daily swims
up and down the Streams He always breeds in some fresh Stream
or clear Fountain of Water yet seeks his Prey in the broad Salt Waters
that are brackish not on the Seaside where I never met with any
He never devours Men in Carolina but uses all ways to avoid them
yet he kills Swine and Dogs the former as they come to feed in the Marshes
the others as they swim over the Creeks and Waters They are very mischievous
to the Wares made for taking Fish into which they come to prey
on the Fish that are caught in the Ware from whence they cannot
readily extricate themselves and so break the Ware in Pieces
being a very strong Creature This Animal in these Parts
sometimes exceeds seventeen Foot long It is impossible to kill them
with a Gun unless you chance to hit them about the Eyes
which is a much softer Place than the rest of their impenetrable Armour
They roar and make a hideous Noise against bad Weather
and before they come out of their Dens in the Spring I was pretty much
frightened with one of these once which happened thus I had built a House
about half a Mile from an Indian Town on the Fork of NeusRiver
where I dwelt by my self excepting a young Indian Fellow and a BullDog
that I had along with me I had not then been so long a Sojourner
in America as to be throughly acquainted with this Creature
One of them had got his Nest directly under my House which stood on
pretty high Land and by a Creekside in whose Banks his Entringplace was
his Den reaching the Ground directly on which my House stood
I was sitting alone by the Fireside about nine a Clock at Night
some time in March the Indian Fellow being gone to the Town
to see his Relations so that there was no body in the House
but my self and my Dog when all of a sudden this illfavourd
Neighbour of mine set up such a Roaring that he made the House shake
about my Ears and so continued like a Bittern but a hundred times louder
if possible for four or five times The Dog stared as if he was frightned
out of his Senses nor indeed could I imagine what it was
having never heard one of them before Immediately again
I had another Lesson and so a third Being at that time
amongst none but Savages I began to suspect they were working
some Piece of Conjuration under my House to get away my Goods
not but that at another time I have as little Faith in their
or any others working Miracles by diabolical Means as any Person living
At last my Man came in to whom when I had told the Story he laughd at me
and presently undeceivd me by telling me what it was that made that Noise
These Allegators lay Eggs as the Ducks do only they are longer shapd
larger and a thicker Shell than they have How long they are in hatching
I cannot tell but as the Indians say it is most part of the Summer
they always lay by a SpringSide the young living in and about the same
as soon as hatchd Their Eggs are laid in Nests made in the Marshes
and contain twenty or thirty Eggs Some of these Creatures afford
a great deal of Musk Their Tail when cut of looks very fair and white
seemingly like the best of Veal Some People have eaten thereof and say
it is delicate Meat when they happen not to be musky Their Flesh
is accounted proper for such as are troubled with the lame Distemper
a sort of Rhumatism so is the Fat very prevailing to remove Aches and Pains
by Unction The Teeth of this Creature when dead are taken out
to make Chargers for Guns being of several Sizes fit for all Loads
They are white and would make pretty SnuffBoxes if wrought by an Artist
After the Tail of the Allegator is separated from the Body
it will move very freely for four days

RattleSnake
The RattleSnakes are found on all the Main of America that I ever had
any Account of being so calld from the Rattle at the end of their Tails
which is a Connexion of jointed Coverings of an excrementitious Matter
betwixt the Substance of a Nail and a Horn though each Tegmen
is very thin Nature seems to have designd these on purpose to give Warning
of such an approaching Danger as the venomous Bite of these Snakes is
Some of them grow to a very great Bigness as six Foot in Length
their Middle being the Thickness of the Small of a lusty Mans Leg
We have an Account of much larger Serpents of this Kind
but I never met them yet although I have seen and killd abundance
in my time They are of an Orange tawny and blackish Colour on the Back
differing as all Snakes do in Colour on the Belly being of an AshColour
inclining to Lead The Male is easily distinguishd from the Female
by a black VelvetSpot on his Head and besides his Head is smaller shaped
and long Their Bite is venomous if not speedily remedied
especially if the Wound be in a Vein Nerve Tendon or Sinew
when it is very difficult to cure The Indians are the best Physicians
for the Bite of these and all other venomous Creatures of this Country
There are four sorts of SnakeRoots already discoverd which Knowledge
came from the Indians who have performd several great Cures
The RattleSnakes are accounted the peaceablest in the World
for they never attack any one or injure them unless they are trod upon
or molested The most Danger of being bit by these Snakes is for those
that survey Land in Carolina yet I never heard of any Surveyor
that was killd or hurt by them I have myself gone over
several of this Sort and others yet it pleased God I never came
to any harm They have the Power or Art I know not which to call it
to charm Squirrels Hares Partridges or any such thing
in such a manner that they run directly into their Mouths
This I have seen by a Squirrel and one of these RattleSnakes
and other Snakes have in some measure the same Power The RattleSnakes
have many small Teeth of which I cannot see they make any use
for they swallow every thing whole but the Teeth which poison are only four
two on each side of their UpperJaws These are bent like a Sickle
and hang loose as if by a Joint Towards the setting on of these
there is in each Tooth a little Hole wherein you may just get in
the Point of a small Needle And here it is that the Poison comes out
which is as green as Grass and follows the Wound
made by the Point of their Teeth They are much more venomous
in the Months of June and July than they are in March
April or September The hotter the Weather the more poisonous
Neither may we suppose that they can renew their Poison as oft as they will
for we have had a Person bit by one of these who never rightly recoverd it
and very hardly escaped with Life a second Person bit in the same Place
by the same Snake and receivd no more Harm that if bitten with a Rat
They cast their Skins every Year and commonly abide near the Place
where the old Skin lies These cast Skins are used in Physick
and the Rattles are reckond good to expedite the Birth
The Gall is made up into Pills with Clay and kept for Use
being given in Pestilential Fevers and the SmallPox It is accounted
a noble Remedy known to few and held as a great Arcanum
This Snake has two Nostrils on each side of his Nose Their Venom
I have Reason to believe effects no Harm any otherwise than when
darted into the Wound by the Serpents Teeth

Ground RattleSnakes
The Ground RattleSnake wrong namd because it has nothing like Rattles
It resembles the RattleSnake a little in Colour but is darker
and never grows to any considerable Bigness not exceeding a Foot
or sixteen Inches He is reckond amongst the worst of Snakes
and stays out the longest of any Snake I know before he returns
in the Fall of the Leaf to his Hole

HornSnake
Of the HornSnakes I never saw but two that I remember
They are like the RattleSnake in Colour but rather lighter
They hiss exactly like a Goose when any thing approaches them
They strike at their Enemy with their Tail and kill whatsoever
they wound with it which is armd at the End with a horny Substance
like a Cocks Spur This is their Weapon I have heard it credibly reported
by those who said they were EyeWitnesses that a small LocustTree
about the Thickness of a Mans Arm being struck by one of these Snakes
at Ten a Clock in the Morning then verdant and flourishing
at four in the Afternoon was dead and the Leaves red and witherd
Doubtless be it how it will they are very venomous I think
the Indians do not pretend to cure their Wound

WaterSnakes
Of WaterSnakes there are four sorts The first is of the HornSnakes Colour
though less The next is a very long Snake differing in Colour
and will make nothing to swim over a River a League wide
They hang upon Birches and other Trees by the WaterSide
I had the Fortune once to have one of them leap into my Boat
as I was going up a narrow River the Boat was full of Mats
which I was glad to take out to get rid of him They are reckond poisonous
A third is much of an English Adders Colour but always
frequents the Salts and lies under the Drift Seaweed
where they are in abundance and are accounted mischievous when they bite
The last is of a sooty black Colour and frequents Ponds and Ditches
What his Qualities are I cannot tell

SwampSnakes
Of the SwampSnakes there are three sorts which are very near akin
to the WaterSnakes and may be rankd amongst them

The Belly of the first is of a Carnation or Pink Colour
his Back a dirty brown they are large but have not much Venom in them
as ever I learnt The next is a large Snake of a brown Dirt Colour
and always abides in the Marshes

The last is mottled and very poisonous They dwell in Swamps Sides
and Ponds and have prodigious wide Mouths and though not long
arrive to the Thickness of the Calf of a Mans Leg

RedBelly LandSnakes
These frequent the Land altogether and are so calld
because of their red Bellies which incline to an OrangeColour
Some have been bitten with these sort of Snakes and not hurt
when others have sufferd very much by them Whether there be
two sorts of these Snakes which we make no Difference of
I cannot at present determine

RedBack Snakes
I never saw but one of these which I stept over and did not see him
till he that brought the Chain after me spyd him He has a red Back
as the last has a red Belly They are a long slender Snake and very rare
to be met withal I enquired of the Indian that was along with me
whether they were very venomous who made Answer that if he had bitten me
even the Indians could not have cured it

Black TruncheonSnake
This sort of Snake might very well have been rankd with the WaterSnakes
They lie under Roots of Trees and on the Banks of Rivers
When any thing disturbs them they dart into the Water which is Salt
like an Arrow out of a Bow They are thick and the shortest Snake
I ever saw What Good or Harm there is in them I know not
Some of these WaterSnakes will swallow a black LandSnake
half as long again as themselves

Scorpion Lizard
The Scorpion Lizard is no more like a Scorpion than a HedgeHog
but they very commonly call him a Scorpion He is of the Lizard Kind
but much bigger his Back is of a dark CopperColour his Belly an Orange
he is very nimble in running up Trees or on the Land and is accounted
very poisonous He has the most Sets of Teeth in his Mouth and Throat
that ever I saw

Green Lizard
Green Lizards are very harmless and beautiful having a little Bladder
under their Throat which they fill with Wind and evacuate the same
at Pleasure They are of a most glorious Green and very tame
They resort to the Walls of Houses in the Summer Season
and stand gazing on a Man without any Concern or Fear
There are several other Colours of these Lizards but none so beautiful
as the green ones are

Frogs
Of Frogs we have several sorts the most famous is the BullFrog so calld
because he lows exactly like that Beast which makes Strangers wonder
when by the side of a Marsh whats the matter for they hear the Frogs low
and can see no Cattle he is very large I believe I have seen one
with as much Meat on him as a Pullet if he had been dressd
The small green Frogs get upon Trees and make a Noise There are
several other colourd small Frogs but the Common LandFrog is likest a Toad
only he leaps and is not poisonous He is a great Devourer of Ants
and the Snakes devour him These Frogs baked and beat to Powder
and taken with OrriceRoot cures a Tympany

Long black Snake
The long black Snake frequents the Land altogether
and is the nimblest Creature living His Bite has no more Venom
than a Prick with a Pin He is the best Mouser that can be
for he leaves not one of that Vermine alive where he comes
He also kills the RattleSnake wheresoever he meets him
by twisting his Head about the Neck of the RattleSnake
and whipping him to Death with his Tail This Whipster haunts
the Dairies of careless Housewives and never misses to skim the Milk
clear of the Cream He is an excellent EggMerchant
for he does not suck the Eggs but swallows them whole as all Snakes do
He will often swallow all the Eggs from under a Hen that sits
and coil himself under the Hen in the Nest where sometimes
the Housewife finds him This Snake for all his Agility is so brittle
that when he is pursued and gets his Head into the Hole of a Tree
if any body gets hold of the other end he will twist and break himself off
in the middle One of these Snakes whose Neck is no thicker
that a Womans little Finger will swallow a Squirrel
so much does that part stretch in all these Creatures

King Snake
The KingSnake is the longest of all others and not common
no Snake they say will meddle with them I think they are not accounted
very venomous The Indians make Girdles and Sashes of their Skins

Green Snake
GreenSnakes are very small tho pretty if any Beauty be allowd to Snakes
Every one makes himself very familiar with them and puts them in their Bosom
because there is no manner of Harm in them

CornSnake
The CornSnakes are but small ones they are of a brown Colour
mixed with tawny There is no more hurt in this than in the green Snake

Vipers
Of those we call Vipers there are two sorts People call these Vipers
because they spread a very flat Head at any time when they are vexd
One of these is a grayish like the Italian Viper the other black and short
and is reckond amongst the worst of Snakes for Venom

Tortois
Tortois vulgarly calld Turtle I have rankd these among the Insects
because they lay Eggs and I did not know well where to put them Among us
there are three sorts The first is the green Turtle which is not common
but is sometimes found on our Coast The next is the Hawksbill
which is common These two sorts are extraordinary Meat
The third is LoggerHead which Kind scarce any one covets
except it be for the Eggs which of this and all other Turtles
are very good Food None of these sorts of Creatures Eggs
will ever admit the White to be harder than a Jelly yet the Yolk
with boiling becomes as hard as any other Egg

Terebin
Of Terebins there are divers sorts all which to be brief we will comprehend
under the Distinction of Land and WaterTerebins

LandTerebin
The LandTerebin is of several Sizes but generally RoundMouthd
and not HawksBilld as some are The Indians eat them Most of them
are good Meat except the very large ones and they are good Food too
provided they are not Musky They are an utter Enemy to the RattleSnake
for when the Terebin meets him he catches hold of him a little below
his Neck and draws his Head into his Shell which makes the Snake
beat his Tail and twist about with all the Strength and Violence imaginable
to get away but the Terebin soon dispatches him and there leaves him
These they call in Europe the Land Tortois their Food is Snails Tadpools
or young Frogs Mushrooms and the Dew and Slime of the Earth and Ponds

WaterTerebin
Water Terebins are small containing about as much Meat as a Pullet
and are extraordinary Food especially in May and June
When they lay their Eggs are very good but they have so many Enemies
that find them out that the hundredth part never comes to Perfection
The Sun and Sand hatch them which come out the Bigness of a small Chesnut
and seek their own Living

BrimstoneSnake
We now come again to the Snakes The Brimstone is so calld I believe
because it is almost of a Brimstone Colour They might as well
have calld it a GlassSnake for it is as brittle as a TobaccoPipe
so that if you give it the least Touch of a small Twigg
it immediately breaks into several Pieces Some affirm
that if you let it remain where you broke it it will come together again
What Harm there is in this brittle Ware I cannot tell
but I never knew any body hurt by them

ChickenSnake
The Egg or ChickenSnake is so calld because it is frequent about
the HenYard and eats Eggs and Chickens they are of a dusky Soot Colour
and will roll themselves round and stick eighteen or twenty Foot high
by the side of a smoothbarkd Pine where there is no manner of Hold
and there sun themselves and sleep all the Sunny Part of the Day
There is no great matter of Poison in them

WoodWorm
The WoodWorms are of a Copper shining Colour scarce so thick
as your little Finger are often found in RottenTrees
They are accounted venomous in case they bite though I never knew any thing
hurt by them They never exceed four or five Inches in length

The Reptiles or smaller Insects are too numerous to relate here
this Country affording innumerable Quantities thereof
as the FlyingStags with Horns Beetles Butterflies Grashoppers
Locust and several hundreds of uncouth Shapes which in the SummerSeason
are discovered here in Carolina the Description of which
requires a large Volume which is not my Intent at present
Besides what the Mountainous Part of this Land may hereafter
lay open to our View Time and Industry will discover
for we that have settled but a small Share of this large Province
cannot imagine but there will be a great number of Discoveries made
by those that shall come hereafter into the Backpart of this Land
and make Enquiries therein when at least we consider that
the Westward of Carolina is quite different in Soil Air Weather
Growth of Vegetables and several Animals too which we at present
are wholly Strangers to and to seek for As to a right Knowledge thereof
I say when another Age is come the Ingenious then in being
may stand upon the Shoulders of those that went before them
adding their own Experiments to what was delivered down to them
by their Predecessors and then there will be something
towards a complete Natural History which in these days
would be no easie Undertaking to any Author that writes
truly and compendiously as he ought to do It is sufficient at present
to write an honest and fair Account of any of the Settlements
in this new World without wandring out of the Path of Truth
or bespattering any Mans Reputation any wise concernd
in the Government of the Colony he that mixes Invectives
with Relations of this Nature rendering himself suspected of Partiality
in whatever he writes For my part I wish all well and he that has received
any severe Dealings from the Magistrate or his Superiours
had best examine himself well if he was not first in the Fault if so
then he can justly blame none but himself for what has happend to him

Having thus gone thro the Insects as in the Table except the EelSnake
so calld though very improperly because he is nothing but a Loach
that sucks and cannot bite as the Snakes do He is very large
commonly sixteen Inches or a Foot and half long having all the Properties
that other Loaches have and dwells in Pools and Waters as they do
Notwithstanding we have the same Loach as you have in Bigness

This is all that at present I shall mention touching the Insects
and so go on to give an Account of the Fowls and Birds
that are properly found in Carolina which are these

BaldEagle
As the Eagle is reckond the King of Birds I have begun with him
The first I shall speak of is the bald Eagle so calld because his Head
to the middle of his Neck and his Tail is as white as Snow
These Birds continually breed the Year round for when the young Eagles
are just downd with a sort of white woolly Feathers the HenEagle
lays again which Eggs are hatchd by the Warmth of the young ones
in the Nest so that the Flight of one Brood makes Room for the next
that are but just hatchd They prey on any living thing they can catch
They are heavy of Flight and cannot get their Food by Swiftness
to help which there is a Fishawk that catches Fishes and suffers the Eagle
to take them from her although she is longwingd and a swift Flyer
and can make far better way in her Flight than the Eagle can The bald Eagle
attends the Gunners in Winter with all the Obsequiousness imaginable
and when he shoots and kills any Fowl the Eagle surely comes in for his Bird
and besides those that are wounded and escape the Fowler
fall to the Eagles share He is an excellent Artist at stealing young Pigs
which Prey he carries alive to his Nest at which time the poor Pig
makes such a Noise over Head that Strangers that have heard them cry
and not seen the Bird and his Prey have thought there were
Flying Sows and Pigs in that Country The Eagles Nest is made of Twigs
Sticks and Rubbish It is big enough to fill a handsome Carts Body
and commonly so full of nasty Bones and Carcasses that it stinks
most offensively This Eagle is not bald till he is one or two years old

Gray Eagle
The gray Eagle is altogether the same sort of Bird as the Eagle in Europe
therefore we shall treat no farther of him

FishingHawk
The FishingHawk is the Eagles Jackal which most commonly
though not always takes his Prey for him He is a large Bird
being above two thirds as big as the Eagle He builds his Nest
as the Eagles do that is in a dead CypressTree either standing in
or hard by the Water The Eagle and this Bird seldom sit on a living Tree
He is of a gray pied Colour and the most dexterous Fowl in Nature
at Catching of Fish which he wholly lives on never eating any Flesh

TurkeyBuzzard
The TurkeyBuzzard of Carolina is a small Vulture which lives on
any dead Carcasses They are about the Bigness of the FishingHawk
and have a nasty Smell with them They are of the Kites Colour
and are reported to be an Enemy to Snakes by killing all they meet withal
of that Kind

Herringtaild Hawk
The Herring or Swallowtaild Hawk is about the Bigness of a Falcon
but a much longer Bird He is of a delicate AuroraColour
the Pinions of his Wings and End of his Tail are black
He is a very beautiful Fowl and never appears abroad but in the Summer
His Prey is chiefly on Snakes and will kill the biggest we have
with a great deal of Dexterity and Ease

Goshawk
Goshawks are very plentiful in Carolina They are not seemingly so large
as those from Muscovy but appear to be a very brisk Bird

Falcon
The Falcon is much the same as in Europe and promises to be a brave Bird
tho I never had any of them in my Hand neither did I ever see any of them
in any other Posture than on the Wing which always happend to be
in an Evening and flying to the Westward therefore I believe
they have their Abode and Nest among the Mountains where we may expect
to find them and several other Species that we are at present Strangers to

Merlin
The Merlin is a small Bird in Europe but much smaller here
yet he very nimbly kills the smaller sorts of Birds and sometimes
the Partridge if caught alive he would be a great Rarity
because of his Beauty and Smalness

SparrowHawk
The SparrowHawk in Carolina is no bigger than a Fieldfare in England
He flies at the Bush and sometimes kills a small Bird but his chiefest Food
is Reptiles as Beetles Grashoppers and such small things
He is exactly of the same Colour as the SparrowHawk in England
only has a blackish Hood by his Eyes

Hobby
Hobbies are the same here as in England and are not often met withal

Ring Tail
The Ringtail is a shortwingd Hawk preying on Mice and such Vermine
in the Marshes as in England

Ravens
Ravens the same as in England though very few I have not seen above six
in eight Years time

Crows
Crows are here less than in England They are as good Meat as a Pigeon
and never feed on any Carrion They are great Enemies to the CornFields
and cry and build almost like Rooks

BlackBirds
Of these we have two sorts which are the worst Vermine in America
They fly sometimes in such Flocks that they destroy every thing before them
They both sorts build in hollow Trees as Starlings do The first sort
is near as big as a Dove and is very white and delicate Food
The other sort is very beautiful and about the Bigness of the Owsel
Part of their Head next to the Bill and the Pinions of their Wings
are of an Orange and glorious Crimson Colour They are as good Meat
as the former tho very few here where large Fowl are so plenty
ever trouble themselves to kill or dress them

Bunting two sorts
Of the BuntingLarks we have two sorts though the Heel of this Bird
is not so long as in Europe The first of these often accompany
the Blackbirds and sing as the BuntingLarks in England do
differing very little The first sort has an OrangeColour
on the Tops of their Wings and are as good Meat as those in Europe
The other sort is something less of a lighter Colour
nothing differing therein from those in England as to Feathers
Bigness and Meat

Pheasant
The Pheasant of Carolina differs some small matter from
the English Pheasant being not so big and having some difference
in Feather yet he is not any wise inferiour in Delicacy
but is as good Meat or rather finer He haunts the back Woods
and is seldom found near the Inhabitants

Woodcock
The Woodcocks live and breed here though they are not in great plenty
as I have seen them in some Parts of England and other Places
They want one third of the English Woodcock in Bigness
but differ not in Shape or Feather save that their Breast
is of a Carnation Colour and they make a Noise when they are on the Wing
like the Bells about a Hawks Legs They are certainly as dainty Meat
as any in the World Their Abode is in all Parts of this Country
in low boggy Ground Springs Swamps and Percoarsons

Snipe
The Snipes here frequent the same Places as they do in England
and differ nothing from them They are the only wild Bird
that is nothing different from the Species of Europe and keeps with us
all the Year In some Places there are a great many of these Snipes

Partridge
Our Partridges in Carolina very often take upon Trees
and have a sort of Whistle and Call quite different from those in England
They are a very beautiful Bird and great Destroyers of the Pease
in Plantations wherefore they set Traps and catch many of them
They have the same Feather as in Europe only the Cock wants
the HorseShooe in lieu of which he has a fair HalfCircle over each Eye
These as well as the Woodcock are less than the European Bird
but far finer Meat They might be easily transported to any Place
because they take to eating after caught

Moorhen
The Moorhens are of the black Game I am informd that the gray Game
haunts the Hills They never come into the Settlement
but keep in the hilly Parts

Jay
Jays are here common and very mischievous in devouring our Fruit
and spoiling more than they eat They are abundantly more beautiful
and finer featherd than those in Europe and not above half so big

GreenPlover
The Lapwing or GreenPlover are here very common They cry pretty much
as the English Plovers do and differ not much in Feather
but want a third of their Bigness

GrayPlover
The gray or whistling Plover are very scarce amongst us
I never saw any but three times that fell and settled on the Ground
They differ very little from those in Europe as far as I could discern
I have seen several great Flocks of them fly over head therefore believe
they inhabit the Valleys near the Mountains

Pigeons
Our wild Pigeons are like the WoodQueese or StockDoves
only have a longer Tail They leave us in the Summer This sort of Pigeon
as I said before is the most like our StockDoves or WoodPigeons
that we have in England only these differ in their Tails
which are very long much like a Parrakeetos You must understand
that these Birds do not breed amongst us who are settled at
and near the Mouths of the Rivers as I have intimated to you before
but come down especially in hard Winters amongst the Inhabitants
in great Flocks as they were seen to do in the Year 1707
which was the hardest Winter that ever was known since Carolina
has been seated by the Christians And if that Country had such hard Weather
what must be expected of the severe Winters in Pensylvania NewYork
and NewEngland where Winters are ten times if possible
colder than with us Although the Flocks are in such Extremities
very numerous yet they are not to be mentiond in Comparison with
the great and infinite Numbers of these Fowl that are met withal
about a hundred or a hundred and fifty Miles to the Westward of the Places
where we at present live and where these Pigeons come down in quest of
a small sort of Acorns which in those Parts are plentifully found
They are the same we call TurkyAcorns because the wild Turkies
feed very much thereon And for the same Reason those Trees that bear them
are calld TurkyOaks I saw such prodigious Flocks of these Pigeons
in January or February 17012 which were in the hilly Country
between the great Nation of the Esaw Indians and the pleasant Stream
of Sapona which is the WestBranch of Clarendon or CapeFair River
that they had broke down the Limbs of a great many large Trees
all over those Woods whereon they chanced to sit and roost
especially the great Pines which are a more brittle Wood
than our sorts of Oak are These Pigeons about SunRise
when we were preparing to march on our Journey would fly by us
in such vast Flocks that they would be near a Quarter of an Hour
before they were all passd by and as soon as that Flock was gone
another would come and so successively one after another
for great part of the Morning It is observable that whereever these Fowl
come in such Numbers as I saw them then they clear all before them
scarce leaving one Acorn upon the Ground which would doubtless
be a great Prejudice to the Planters that should seat there
because their Swine would be thereby deprivd of their Mast
When I saw such Flocks of the Pigeons I now speak of none of our Company
had any other sort of Shot than that which is cast in Moulds
and was so very large that we could not put above ten or a dozen of them
into our largest Pieces Wherefore we made but an indifferent Hand
of shooting them although we commonly killd a Pigeon for every Shot
They were very fat and as good Pigeons as ever I eat
I enquired of the Indians that dwelld in those Parts where it was
that those Pigeons bred and they pointed towards the vast Ridge of Mountains
and said they bred there Now whether they make their Nests
in the Holes in the Rocks of those Mountains or build in Trees
I could not learn but they seem to me to be a WoodPigeon
that build in Trees because of their frequent sitting thereon
and their Roosting on Trees always at Night under which
their Dung commonly lies half a Foot thick and kills every thing that grows
where it falls

Turtle Doves
Turtle Doves are here very plentiful they devour the Pease for which Reason
People make Traps and catch them

Parrakeetos
The Parrakeetos are of a green Colour and OrangeColourd
half way their Head Of these and the Allegators there is none found
to the Northward of this Province They visit us first
when Mulberries are ripe which Fruit they love extremely
They peck the Apples to eat the Kernels so that the Fruit rots and perishes
They are mischievous to Orchards They are often taken alive and will become
familiar and tame in two days They have their Nests in hollow Trees
in low swampy Ground They devour the BirchBuds in April
and lie hidden when the Weather is frosty and hard

Thrushes
The Thrushes in America are the same as in England
and red under the Wings They never appear amongst us but in hard Weather
and presently leave us again

WoodPeckers
Of Woodpeckers we have four sorts The first is as big as a Pigeon
being of a dark brown Colour with a white Cross on his Back his Eyes circled
with white and on his Head stands a Tuft of beautiful Scarlet Feathers
His Cry is heard a long way and he flies from one rotten Tree to another
to get Grubs which is the Food he lives on

Second
The second sort are of an OliveColour striped with yellow They eat Worms
as well as Grubs and are about the Bigness of those in Europe

Third
The third is the same Bigness as the last he is pied with black and white
has a Crimson Head without a Topping and is a Plague to the Corn and Fruit
especially the Apples He opens the Covering of the young Corn
so that the Rain gets in and rots it

Fourth
The fourth sort of these Woodpeckers is a black and white speckled
or mottled the finest I ever saw The Cock has a red Crown
he is not near so big as the others his Food is Grubs Corn
and other creeping Insects He is not very wild but will let one
come up to him then shifts on the other side the Tree
from your sight and so dodges you for a long time together
He is about the size of an English Lark

MockingBirds
The MockingBird is about as big as a Throstle in England but longer
they are of a white and gray Colour and are held to be
the Choristers of America as indeed they are They sing with
the greatest Diversity of Notes that is possible for a Bird to change to
They may be bred up and will sing with us tame in Cages
yet I never take any of their Nests altho they build yearly
in my FruitTrees because I have their Company as much as if tame
as to the singing Part They often sit upon our Chimneys in Summer
there being then no Fire in them and sing the whole Evening
and most part of the Night They are always attending our Dwellings
and feed upon Mulberries and other Berries and Fruits
especially the Mechoacanberry which grows here very plentifully

2d sort
There is another sort calld the GroundMockingBird She is
the same bigness and of a Cinnamon Colour This Bird sings excellently well
but is not so common amongst us as the former

CatBird
The CatBird so namd because it makes a Noise exactly like young Cats
They have a blackish Head and an Ashcoloured Body
and have no other Note that I know of They are no bigger than a Lark
yet will fight a Crow or any other great Bird

Cuckoo
The Cuckoo of Carolina may not properly be so calld
because she never uses that Cry yet she is of the same Bigness and Feather
and sucks the SmallBirds Eggs as the English Cuckoo does

BlueBird
A BlueBird is the exact Bigness of a Robinredbreast
The Cock has the same colourd Breast as the Robin has and his Back
and all the other Parts of him are of as fine a Blue as can possibly be seen
in any thing in the World He has a Cry and a Whistle They hide themselves
all the Winter

Bulfinch
Bulfinches in America differ something from those in Europe
in their Feathers tho not in their Bigness I never knew any one tame
therefore know not what they might be brought to

Nightingale
The Nightingales are different in Plumes from those in Europe
They always frequent the low Groves where they sing very prettily all Night

HedgeSparrow
HedgeSparrows are here though few Hedges They differ scarce any thing
in Plume or Bigness only I never heard this Whistle
as the English one does especially after Rain

Wren
The Wren is the same as in Europe yet I never heard any Note she has
in Carolina

Sparrow
Sparrows here differ in Feather from the English We have
several Species of Birds calld Sparrows one of them much resembling
the Bird calld a Corinthian Sparrow

Lark
The Lark with us resorts to the Savannas or natural Meads
and green Marshes He is colourd and heeld as the Lark is
but his Breast is of a glittering fair LemonColour and he is as big
as a Fieldfare and very fine Food

RedBirds
The RedBirds whose Cock is all over of a rich Scarlet Feather
with a tufted Crown on his Head of the same Colour
are the Bigness of a BuntingLark and very hardy having a strong thick Bill
They will sing very prettily when taken old and put in a Cage
They are good Birds to turn a Cage with Bells or if taught
as the Bulfinch is I believe would prove very docible

EastIndia Bats
EastIndia Bats or Musqueto Hawks are the Bigness of a Cuckoo
and much of the same Colour They are so calld because the same sort
is found in the EastIndies They appear only in the Summer
and live on Flies which they catch in the Air as Gnats Musquetos c

Martins
Martins are here of two sorts The first is the same as in England
the other as big as a BlackBird They have white Throats and Breasts
with black Backs The Planters put Gourds on standing Poles
on purpose for these Fowl to build in because they are a very Warlike Bird
and beat the Crows from the Plantations

Swift
The Swift or Diveling the same as in England

Swallow
Swallows the same as in England

HummingBird
The HummingBird is the Miracle of all our wingd Animals
He is featherd as a Bird and gets his Living as the Bees
by sucking the Honey from each Flower In some of the larger sort of Flowers
he will bury himself by diving to suck the bottom of it so that
he is quite coverd and oftentimes Children catch them in those Flowers
and keep them alive for five or six days They are of different Colours
the Cock differing from the Hen The Cock is of a green red
Aurora and other Colours mixt He is much less than a Wren
and very nimble His Nest is one of the greatest Pieces of Workmanship
the whole Tribe of wingd Animals can shew it commonly hanging
on a single Bryar most artificially woven a small Hole being left
to go in and out at The Eggs are the Bigness of Pease

TomTit
The TomTit or OxEyes as in England

Owls
Of Owls we have two sorts the smaller sort is like ours in England
the other sort is as big as a middling Goose and has a prodigious Head
They make a fearful Hollowing in the Nighttime like a Man
whereby they often make Strangers lose their way in the Woods

Scritch Owls
Scritch Owls much the same as in Europe

BaltimoreBird
The BaltimoreBird so calld from the Lord Baltimore
Proprietor of all Maryland in which Province many of them are found
They are the Bigness of a Linnet with yellow Wings and beautiful
in other Colours

Throstle
Throstle the same Size and Feather as in Europe but I never could hear
any of them sing

Weet Bird
The Weet so calld because he cries always before Rain
he resembles nearest the Firetail

Cranes and Storks
Cranes use the Savannas low Ground and Frogs they are above five Foothigh
when extended are of a Cream Colour and have a Crimson Spot
on the Crown of their Heads Their Quills are excellent for Pens
their Flesh makes the best Broth yet is very hard to digest
Among them often frequent Storks which are here seen and no where besides
in America that I have yet heard of The Cranes are easily
bred up tame and are excellent in a Garden to destroy Frogs Worms
and other Vermine

SnowBirds
The SnowBirds are most numerous in the North Parts of America
where there are great Snows They visit us sometimes in Carolina
when the Weather is harder than ordinary They are like the Stones Smach
or WheatEars and are delicate Meat

Yellow Wings
These YellowWings are a very small Bird of a Linnets Colour
but Wings as yellow as Gold They frequent high up in our Rivers and Creeks
and keep themselves in the thick Bushes very difficult to be seen
in the Spring They sing very prettily

WhippooWill
WhippooWill so namd because it makes those Words exactly
They are the Bigness of a Thrush and call their Note under a Bush
on the Ground hard to be seen though you hear them never so plain
They are more plentiful in Virginia than with us in Carolina
for I never heard but one that was near the Settlement and that was hardby
an Indian Town

Red Sparrow
This nearest resembles a Sparrow and is the most common SmallBird we have
therefore we call them so They are brown and red cinnamon Colour striped

Water Fowl
Of the Swans we have two sorts the one we call Trompeters
because of a sort of trompeting Noise they make

Swans
These are the largest sort we have which come in great Flocks in the Winter
and stay commonly in the fresh Rivers till February
that the Spring comes on when they go to the Lakes to breed
A Cygnet that is a last Years Swan is accounted a delicate Dish
as indeed it is They are known by their Head and Feathers
which are not so white as Old ones

Hooper
The sort of Swans calld Hoopers are the least They abide more
in the SaltWater and are equally valuable for Food with the former
It is observable that neither of these have a black Piece of horny Flesh
down the Head and Bill as they have in England

Wild Geese
Of Geese we have three sorts differing from each other only in size
Ours are not the common Geese that are in the Fens in England
but the other sorts with black Heads and Necks

Gray Brants
The gray Brant or Barnicle is here very plentiful as all
other WaterFowl are in the WinterSeason They are the same
which they call Barnicles in GreatBritain and are a very good Fowl
and eat well

White Brant
There is also a white Brant very plentiful in America
This Bird is all over as white as Snow except the Tips of his Wings
and those are black They eat the Roots of Sedge and Grass
in the Marshes and Savannas which they tear up like Hogs
The best way to kill these Fowl is to burn a Piece of Marsh or Savanna
and as soon as it is burnt they will come in great Flocks to get the Roots
where you kill what you please of them They are as good Meat as the other
only their Feathers are stubbed and good for little

SeaPie or Curlue
The SeaPie or gray Curlue is about the Bigness of a very large Pigeon
but longer He has a long Bill as other Curlues have
which is the Colour of an English Owsels that is yellow as are his Legs
He frequents the Sandbeaches on the Seaside and when killd
is inferiour to no Fowl I ever eat of

Will Willet
Will Willet is so called from his Cry which he very exactly
calls Will Willet as he flies His Bill is like a Curlues or Woodcocks
and has much such a Body as the other yet not so tall He is good Meat

Great gray Gull
The great gray Gulls are good Meat and as large as a Pullet
They lay large Eggs which are found in very great Quantities
on the Islands in our Sound in the Months of June and July
The young Squabs are very good Victuals and often prove a Relief
to Travellers by Water that have spent their Provisions

Old Wives
Old Wives are a black and white pied Gull with extraordinary long Wings
and a golden colourd Bill and Feet He makes a dismal Noise as he flies
and ever and anon dips his Bill in the SaltWater I never knew him eaten

SeaCock
The SeaCock is a Gull that crows at Break of Day and in the Morning
exactly like a Dunghil Cock which Cry seems very pleasant
in those uninhabited Places He is never eaten

Curlues Coots Kingfisher Loons two sorts
Of Curlues there are three sorts and vast Numbers of each
They have all long Bills and differ neither in Colour nor Shape
only in Size The largest is as big as a good Hen the smaller
the Bigness of a Snipe or something bigger

Bitterns three sorts
We have three sorts of Bitterns in Carolina The first is the same
as in England the second of a deep brown with a great Topping
and yellowish white Throat and Breast and is lesser than the former
the last is no bigger than a Woodcock and near the Colour of the second

Herns
We have the same Herns as in England

WhiteHerns
White Herns are here very plentiful I have seen above thirty
sit on one Tree at a time They are as white as Milk and fly very slowly

WaterPheasant
The WaterPheasant very improperly calld so are a WaterFowl
of the DuckKind having a Topping of pretty Feathers which sets them out
They are very good Meat

Little gray Gull
The little GrayGull is of a curious gray Colour and abides near the Sea
He is about the Bigness of a WhistlingPlover and delicate Food

Dipper
We have the little Dipper or Fisher that catches Fish so dexterously
the same as you have in the Islands of Scilly

Duck and Mallard
We have of the same Ducks and Mallards with green Heads in great Flocks
They are accounted the coarsest sort of our WaterFowl

Black Duck
The black Duck is full as large as the other and good Meat
She stays with us all the Summer and breeds These are made tame by some
and prove good Domesticks

Summer Duck
We have another Duck that stays with us all the Summer
She has a great Topping is pied and very beautiful She builds her Nest
in a Woodpeckers Hole very often sixty or seventy Foot high

Whistling Duck
Towards the Mountains in the hilly Country on the WestBranch
of CaipFair Inlet we saw great Flocks of pretty pied Ducks
that whistled as they flew or as they fed I did not kill any of them

Scarlet Eyd Duck
We killd a curious sort of Ducks in the Country of the EsawIndians
which were of many beautiful Colours Their Eyes were red
having a red Circle of Flesh for their Eyelids and were very good to eat

BlueWings
The BlueWings are less than a Duck but fine Meat These are the first Fowls
that appear to us in the Fall of the Leaf coming then in great Flocks
as we suppose from Canada and the Lakes that lie behind us

Widgeon
Widgeons the same as in Europe are here in great Plenty

Teal two sorts
We have the same Teal as in England and another sort
that frequents the FreshWater and are always nodding their Heads
They are smaller than the common Teal and dainty Meat

Shovellers
Shovellers a sort of Duck are gray with a black Head
They are a very good Fowl

Whistlers
These are called Whistlers from the whistling Noise they make as they fly

BlackFlusterers or BaldCoot
Black Flusterers some call these Old Wives They are as black as Ink
The Cocks have white Faces They always remain in the midst of Rivers
and feed upon drift Grass Carnels or SeaNettles They are the fattest Fowl
I ever saw and sometimes so heavy with Flesh that they cannot rise
out of the Water They make an odd sort of Noise when they fly
What Meat they are I could never learn Some call these the great bald Coot

Turkeys
The wild Turkeys I should have spoken of when I treated of the LandFowl
There are great Flocks of these in Carolina I have seen about five hundred
in a Flock some of them are very large I never weighd any myself
but have been informd of one that weighd near sixty Pound Weight
I have seen half a Turkey feed eight hungry Men two Meals
Sometimes the wild breed with the tame ones which they reckon
makes them very hardy as I believe it must I see no manner of Difference
betwixt the wild Turkeys and the tame ones only the wild are ever
of one Colour viz a dark gray or brown and are excellent Food
They feed on Acorns HuckleBerries and many other sorts of Berries
that Carolina affords The Eggs taken from the Nest and hatchd
under a Hen will yet retain a wild Nature and commonly leave you
and run wild at last and will never be got into a House to roost
but always pearch on some high Tree hardby the House
and separate themselves from the tame sort although at the same time
they tread and breed together I have been informd that if you take
these wild Eggs when just on the point of being hatchd
and dip them for some small time in a Bowl of Milkwarm Water
it will take off their wild Nature and make them as tame and domestick
as the others Some Indians have brought these wild Breed hatchd at home
to be a Decoy to bring others to roost near their Cabins
which they have shot But to return to the WaterFowl

Fishermen
Fishermen are like a Duck but have a narrow Bill with Setts of Teeth
They live on very small Fish which they catch as they swim along
They taste Fishy The best way to order them is upon occasion
to pull out the OilBox from the Rump and then bury them five or six Hours
under Ground Then they become tolerable

Divers
Of Divers there are two sorts the one pied the other gray both good Meat

RaftFowl
RaftFowl includes all the sorts of small Ducks and Teal
that go in Rafts along the Shoar and are of several sorts
that we know no Name for

BullNecks
These are a whitish Fowl about the Bigness of a Brant
they come to us after Christmas in very great Flocks in all our Rivers
They are a very good Meat but hard to kill because hard to come near
They will dive and endure a great deal of Shot

RedHeads
RedHeads a lesser Fowl than BullNecks are very sweet Food
and plentiful in our Rivers and Creeks

TropickBirds
TropickBirds are a white Mew with a forked Tail They are so calld
because they are plentifully met withal under the Tropicks and thereabouts

Pellican
The Pellican of the Wilderness cannot be the same as ours
this being a WaterFowl with a great natural Wen or Pouch under his Throat
in which he keeps his Prey of Fish which is what he lives on
He is Webfooted like a Goose and shapd like a Duck
but is a very large Fowl bigger than a Goose He is never eaten as Food
They make Tobaccopouches of his Maw

Cormorant
Cormorants are very well known in some Parts of England
we have great Flocks of them with us especially against the Herrings run
which is in March and April then they sit upon Logs of dry Wood
in the Water and catch the Fish

Gannet
The Gannet is a large white Fowl having one Part of his Wings black
he lives on Fish as the Pellican His Fat or Grease
is as yellow as Saffron and the best thing known to preserve FireArms
from Rust

ShearWater
ShearWaters are a longer Fowl than a Duck some of them lie on the Coast
whilst others range the Seas all over Sometimes they are met
five hundred Leagues from Land They live without drinking any fresh Water

PiedGull
We have a great pied Gull black and white which seems to have a black Hood
on his Head these lay very fair Eggs which are good as are the young ones
in the Season

MarshHen
MarshHen much the same as in Europe only she makes another sort of Noise
and much shriller

BluePeters
The same as you call WaterHens in England are here very numerous
and not regarded for eating

SandBirds
The SandBirds are about the Bigness of a Lark and frequent our SandBeaches
they are a dainty Food if you will bestow Time and Ammunition to kill them

Runners
These are called Runners because if you run after them
they will run along the Sands and not offer to get up
so that you may often drive them together to shoot as you please
They are a pleasant small Bird

Tutcocks
A sort of Snipe but sucks not his Food they are almost the same
as in England

SwaddleBills
SwaddleBills are a sort of an ashcolourd Duck which have
an extraordinary broad Bill and are good Meat they are not common
as the others are

Mew
The same Mew as in England being a white slender Bird with red Feet

ShelDrakes
The same as in England

BaldFaces
The bald or white Faces are a good Fowl They cannot dive
and are easily shotten

WaterWitch
WaterWitch or WareCoots are a Fowl with Down and no Feathers
they dive incomparably so that no Fowler can hit them
They can neither fly nor go but get into the Fishwares
and cannot fly over the Rods and so are taken

Thus have we given an Account of what Fowl has come to our Knowledge
since our Abode in Carolina except some that perhaps
have slipt our Memory and so are left out of our Catalogue
Proceed we now to treat of the Inhabitants of the Watry Element
which tho we can as yet do but very imperfectly yet we are willing
to oblige the Curious with the best Account that is in our Power
to present them withal

Whale
Whales are very numerous on the Coast of North Carolina
from which they make Oil Bone c to the great Advantage of those
inhabiting the SandBanks along the Ocean where these Whales come ashore
none being struck or killd with a Harpoon in this Place
as they are to the Northward and elsewhere all those Fish being found dead
on the Shoar most commonly by those that inhabit the Banks and Seaside
where they dwell for that Intent and for the Benefit of Wrecks
which sometimes fall in upon that Shoar

Of these Monsters there are four sorts the first which is most
choice and rich is the Sperma Caeti Whale from which the Sperma Caeti
is taken These are rich Prizes but I never heard but of one found
on this Coast which was near CurrituckInlet

The other sorts are of a prodigious Bigness Of these the Bone and Oil
is made the Oil being the Blubber or oily Flesh or Fat of that Fish boild
These differ not only in Colour some being pied others not
but very much in shape one being calld a BottleNosed Whale
the other a ShovelNose which is as different as a Salmon from a Sturgeon
These Fish seldom come ashoar with their Tongues in their Heads
the Thrasher which is the Whales mortal Enemy wheresoever he meets him
eating that out of his Head as soon as he and the SwordFish have killd him
For when the Whalecatchers in other Parts kill any of these Fish
they eat the Tongue and esteem it an excellent Dish

There is another sort of these Whales or great Fish
though not common I never knew of above one of that sort
found on the Coast of North Carolina and he was contrary in Shape
to all others ever found before him being sixty Foot in Length
and not above three or four Foot Diameter Some Indians in America
will go out to Sea and get upon a Whales Back and peg or plug up his Spouts
and so kill him

Thrashers
The Thrashers are large Fish and mortal Enemies to the Whale
as I said before They make good Oil but are seldom found

DivelFish
The DivelFish lies at some of our Inlets and as near as I can describe him
is shapd like a Scate or Stingray only he has on his Head
a Pair of very thick strong Horns and is of a monstrous Size and Strength
for this Fish has been known to weigh a Sloops Anchor
and run with the Vessel a League or two and bring her back against Tide
to almost the same Place Doubtless they may afford good Oil
but I have no Experience of any Profits which arise from them

SwordFish
The SwordFish is the other of the Whales Enemies and joins
with the Thrasher to destroy that Monster After they have overcome him
they eat his Tongue as I said before and the Whale drives ashoar

Crampois
Crampois is a large Fish and by some accounted a young Whale
but it is not so neither is it more than twenty five or thirty Foot long
They spout as the Whale does and when taken yield good Oil

BottleNoses
BottleNoses are between the Crampois and Porpois and lie near the Soundings
They are never seen to swim leisurely as sometimes all other Fish do
but are continually running after their Prey in Great Shoals
like wild Horses leaping now and then above the Water The French
esteem them good Food and eat them both fresh and salt

Porpoises
Porpoises are frequent all over the Ocean and Rivers that are salt
nay we have a FreshWater Lake in the great Sound of North Carolina
that has Porpoises in it And several sorts of other unknown Fish
as the Indians say that we are wholly Strangers to As to the Porpoises
they make good Oil they prey upon other Fish as Drums yet never are known
to take a Bait so as to be catchd with a Hook

Sharks
Of these there are two sorts one calld ParacoodaNoses
the other ShovelNoses they cannot take their Prey before
they turn themselves on their Backs wherefore some Negros
and others that can swim and dive well go naked into the Water
with a Knife in their Hand and fight the Shark and very commonly kill him
or wound him so that he turns Tail and runs away Their Livors make
good Oil to dress Leather withal the Bones found in their Head
are said to hasten the Birth and ease the Stone by bringing it away
Their Meat is eaten in scarce times but I never could away with it
though a great Lover of Fish Their BackBone is of one entire Thickness
Of the Bones or Joints I have known Buttons made which serve well enough
in scarce Times and remote Places

DogFish
The DogFish are a small sort of the Shark Kind and are caught
with Hook and Line fishing for Drums They say they are good Meat
but we have so many other sorts of delicate Fish that I shall hardly ever
make Tryal what they are

SpanishMackarel
Spanish Mackarel are in Colour and Shape like the common Mackarel
only much thicker They are caught with Hook and Line at the Inlets
and sometimes out a little way at Sea They are a very fine hard Fish
and of good Taste They are about two Foot long or better

Cavallies
Cavallies are taken in the same Places They are of a brownish Colour
have exceeding small Scales and a very thick Skin they are as firm a Fish
as ever I saw therefore will keep sweet in the hot Weather two days
when others will stink in half a day unless salted They ought to be scaled
as soon as taken otherwise you must pull off the Skin and Scales
when boiled the Skin being the choicest of the Fish The Meat
which is white and large is dressd with this Fish

Bonetos
Bonetos are a very palatable Fish and near a Yard long
They haunt the Inlets and Water near the Ocean and are killed
with the Harpoon and Fishgig

BlueFish
The Blue Fish is one of our best Fishes and always very fat
They are as long as a Salmon and indeed I think full as good Meat
These Fish come in the Fall of the Year generally after
there has been one black Frost when there appear great Shoals of them
The Hatteras Indians and others run into the Sands of the Sea
and strike them though some of these Fish have caused
Sickness and violent Burnings after eating of them which is found
to proceed from the Gall that is broken in some of them and is hurtful
Sometimes many Cartloads of these are thrown and left dry on the Sea side
which comes by their eager Pursuit of the small Fish
in which they run themselves ashoar and the Tide leaving them
they cannot recover the Water again They are called BlueFish
because they are of that Colour and have a forked Tail
and are shaped like a Dolphin

RedDrum
The Red Drum is a large Fish much bigger than the BlueFish The Body of this
is good firm Meat but the Head is beyond all the Fish I ever met withal
for an excellent Dish We have greater Numbers of these Fish
than of any other sort People go down and catch as many Barrels full
as they please with Hook and Line especially every young Flood
when they bite These are salted up and transported to other Colonies
that are bare of Provisions

BlackDrum
Black Drums are a thickermade Fish than the Red Drum
being shapd like a fat Pig they are a very good Fish
but not so common with us as to the Northward

AngelFish
The AngelFish is shaped like an English Bream He is so calld
from his golden Colour which shines all about his Head and Belly
This is accounted a very good Fish as are most in these Parts
The Bermudians have the same sort of Fish and esteem them very much

RockFish
Bass or Rock is both in Salt and FreshWater when young
he much resembles a Grayling but grows to the size of the large CodFish
They are a very good firm Fish Their Heads are souced
and make a noble Dish if large

SheepsHead
SheepsHead has the general Vogue of being the choicest Fish in this Place
Indeed it is a very delicate Fish and well relishd yet I think
there are several others full as good as the SheepsHead
He is much of the Bigness of the AngelFish and flat as he is
they sometimes weigh two or three Pound Weight This Fish hath Teeth
like a Sheep and is therefore so calld

Plaice
Plaice are here very large and plentiful being the same as in England

Flounder
Flounders should have gone amongst the FreshWater Fish
because they are caught there in great Plenty

Soles
Soles are a Fish we have but lately discoverd they are as good
as in any other Part

Mullets
Mullets the same as in England and great Plenty in all Places
where the Water is salt or brackish

Shads
Shads are a sweet Fish but very bony they are very plentiful
at some Seasons

FatBacks
FatBacks are a small Fish like Mullets but the fattest ever known
They put nothing into the Pan to fry these They are excellent sweet Food

White GuardFish
The white GuardFish is shaped almost like a Pike but slenderer
his Mouth has a long small Bill set with Teeth in which he catches
small Fish his Scales are knit together like Armour When they dress him
they strip him taking off Scales and Skin together His Meat is very white
and rather looks like Flesh than Fish The English account them
no good Fish but the Indians do The Gall of this Fish is green
and a violent Cathartick if taken inwardly

GreenGuard
The green Guard is shaped in all respects like the other
save that his Scales are very small and fine He is indifferent good Meat
his Bones when boild or fryd remain as green as Grass
The same sort of Fish come before the Mackarel in England

Scate
Scate or Stingray the same as in England and very common
but the great Plenty of other Fish makes these not regarded
for few or none eat them in Carolina though they are almost
at every ones Door

Thornback
Thornbacks are the same as in England They are not so common
as the Scate and WhipRays

CongarEels
CongarEels always remain in the SaltWater they are much more known
in the Northward Parts of America than with us

Lamprey
Lampreys are not common I never saw but one which was large
and caught by the Indians in a Ware They would not eat him
but gave him to me

Eels
Eels are no where in the World better or more plentiful than in Carolina

SunFish
SunFish are flat and rounder than a Bream and are reckond
a finetasted Fish and not without Reason They are much
the size of AngelFish

ToadFish
ToadFish are nothing but a Skin full of Prickles and a few Bones
they are as ugly as a Toad and preservd to look upon
and good for nothing else

SeaTench
They are taken by a Bait near the Inlet or out at Sea a little way
They are blackish and exactly like a Tench except in the Backfins
which have Prickles like a Pearch They are as good if not better
than any Tench

SaltWater Trouts
Trouts of the SaltWater are exactly shaped like the Trouts in Europe
having blackish not red Spots They are in the Salts
and are not red within but white yet a very good Fish They are so tender
that if they are in or near fresh Water and a sudden Frost come
they are benummd and float on the Surface of the Water as if dead
and then they take up CanoeLoads of them If you put them into warm Water
they presently recover

Crocus
The Crocus is a Fish in Shape like a Pearch and in Taste like a Whiting
They croke and make a Noise in your Hand when taken with Hook or Net
They are very good

Herring
The Herrings in Carolina are not so large as in Europe
They spawn there in March and April running up the fresh Rivers
and small fresh Runs of Water in great Shoals where they are taken
They become red if salted and drest with Vinegar and Oil
resemble an Anchovy very much for they are far beyond an English Herring
when pickled

Smelts
The same as in England they lie down a great way in the Sound
towards the Ocean where at some certain Seasons are a great many
very fine ones

Breams
The fresh Water affords no such Bream as in England that I have
as yet discoverd yet there is a SeaBream which is a flat and thin Fish
as the European Breams are

Taylors
The Taylor is a Fish about the Bigness of a Trout but of
a bluish and green Colour with a forked Tail as a Mackarel has
They are a delicate Fish and plentiful in our SaltWaters
Infinite numbers of other Species will be hereafter discoverd
as yet unknown to us although I have seen and eaten of several other
sorts of Fish which are not here mentiond because as yet
they have no certain Names assignd them Therefore I shall treat no farther
of our SaltWater Fish but proceed to the Fresh

Fresh Water Sturgeon
The first of these is the Sturgeon of which we have Plenty
all the fresh Parts of our Rivers being well stord therewith
The Indians upon and towards the Heads and Falls of our Rivers
strike a great many of these and eat them yet the Indians
near the SaltWaters will not eat them I have seen an Indian
strike one of these Fish seven Foot long and leave him on the Sands
to be eaten by the Gulls In May they run up towards
the Heads of the Rivers where you see several hundreds of them in one day
The Indians have another way to take them which is by Nets
at the end of a Pole The Bones of these Fish make good NutmegGraters

Pike
The Jack Pike or Pickerel is exactly the same in Carolina
as they are in England Indeed I never saw this Fish so big and large
in America as I have in Europe these with us being seldom
above two Foot long as far as I have yet seen They are very plentiful
with us in Carolina all our Creeks and Ponds being full of them
I once took out of a Ware above three hundred of these Fish at a time

Trouts
The same in England as in Carolina but ours are a great way up
the Rivers and Brooks that are fresh having swift Currents
and stony and gravelly Bottoms

Gudgeon
The same Gudgeons as in Europe are found in America

First Pearch
The same sort of Pearch as are in England we have likewise in Carolina
though I think ours never rise to be so large as in England

Second Pearch
We have a white Pearch so calld because he is of a Silver Colour
otherwise like the English Pearch These we have in great Plenty
and they are preferable to the red ones

Third Pearch
The brown Pearch which some call Welchmen are the largest
sort of Pearches that we have and very firm white and sweet Fish
These grow to be larger than any Carp and are very frequent
in every Creek and Pond

Fourth flat
The flat or mottled Pearch are shaped almost like a Bream
They are called Irishmen being freckled or mottled with black
and blue Spots They are never taken any where but in the fresh Water
They are good Fish but I do not approve of them no more
than of the other sorts of Pearch

Fifth Pearch or Round Robin
We have another sort of Pearch which is the least sort of all
but as good Meat as any These are distinguishd from the other sorts
by the Name of RoundRobins being flat and very roundshapd
they are spotted with red Spots very beautiful and are easily caught
with an Angle as all the other sort of Pearches are

Carp
We have the same Carp as you have in England

Roach
And the same Roach only scarce so large

Dace
Dace are the same as yours too but neither are these so large nor plentiful
as with you

Loach
The same as in England

SuckingFish
SuckingFish are the nearest in Taste and Shape to a Barbel
only they have no Barbs

CatFish
CatFish are a round blackish Fish with a great flat Head a wide Mouth
and no Scales they something resemble Eels in Taste Both this sort
and another that frequents the Salt Water are very plentiful

Grindals
Grindals are a long scaled Fish with small Eyes and frequent Ponds Lakes
and slowrunning Creeks and Swamps They are a soft sorry Fish
and good for nothing though some eat them for good Fish

OldWives
These are a bright scaly Fish which frequent the Swamps and fresh Runs
they seem to be between an English Roach and a Bream and eat much like
the latter The Indians kill abundance of these and barbakue them
till they are crisp then transport them in wooden Hurdles
to their Towns and Quarters

FountainFish
The FountainFish are a white sort which breed in the clear Running Springs
and Fountains of Water where the Clearness thereof makes them very difficult
to be taken I cannot say how good they are because I have not as yet
tasted of them

WhiteFish
The white Fish are very large some being two Foot and a half long and more
They are found a great way up in the Freshes of the Rivers and are firm Meat
and an extraordinary wellrelishd Fish

Barbouts Millers Thumbs
Barbouts and MillersThumbs are the very same here in all respects
as they are in England What more are in the fresh Waters
we have not discoverd but are satisfied that we are not acquainted
with one third part thereof for we are told by the Indians
of a great many strange and uncouth shapes and sorts of Fish
which they have found in the Lakes laid down in my Chart
However as we can give no farther Account of these than by Hearsay
I proceed to treat of the ShellFish that are found in the SaltWater
so far as they have already come to our Knowledge

Large Crabs
The large Crabs which we call StoneCrabs are the same sort
as in England having black Tips at the end of their Claws
These are plentifully met withal down in Core Sound
and the South Parts of NorthCarolina

Small flat Crabs
The smaller flat Crabs I look upon to be the sweetest of all the Species
They are the Breadth of a lusty Mans Hand or rather larger
These are innumerable lying in most prodigious quantities
all over the Salts of Carolina They are taken not only to eat
but are the best Bait for all sorts of Fish that live in the SaltWater
These Fish are mischievous to NightHooks because they get away all the Bait
from the Hooks

Oysters
Oysters great and small are found almost in every Creek
and Gut of SaltWater and are very good and wellrelishd
The large Oysters are excellent pickled

Cockles
One Cockle in Carolina is as big as five or six in England
They are often thrown upon the Sands on the SoundSide where the Gulls
are always ready to open and eat them

Clams
Clams are a sort of Cockles only differing in Shell
which is thicker and not streakd or ribbd These are found throughout
all the Sound and SaltWaterPonds The Meat is the same for Look and Taste
as the Cockle These make an excellent strong Broth and eat well
either roasted or pickled

Muscles
The Muscles in Carolina have a very large Shell striped with Dents
They grow by the side of Ponds and Creeks in SaltWater
wherein you may get as many of them as you please I do not like them so well
as the English Muscle which is no good ShellFish

Conks
Some of the Shells of these are as large as a Mans Hand
but the lesser sort are the best Meat and those not extraordinary
They are shapd like the end of a Horses Yard Of their Shells
the Peak or Wampum is made which is the richest Commodity
amongst the Indians They breed like a long Thing shapd like a Snake
but containing a sort of Joints in the Hollowness whereof
are thousands of small Coaks no bigger then small Grains of Pepper

Skellops
The Skellops if well dressd are a pretty ShellFish
but to eat them only roasted without any other Addition in my Judgment
are too luscious

Man of Noses
Man of Noses are a ShellFish commonly found amongst us They are valued
for increasing Vigour in Men and making barren Women fruitful
but I think they have no need of that Fish for the Women in Carolina
are fruitful enough without their Helps

Wilks
Wilks or Periwinkles are not so large here as in the Islands of Scilly
and in other Parts of Europe though very sweet

SnailHorn
The SeaSnailHorn is large and very good Meat they are exactly shaped
as other SnailHorns are

Fidlar
Fidlars are a sort of small Crabs that lie in Holes in the Marshes
The Raccoons eat them very much I never knew any one try
whether they were good Meat or no

Runner
Runners live chiefly on the Sands but sometimes run into the Sea
They have Holes in the SandBeaches and are a whitish sort of a Crab
Tho small they run as fast as a Man and are good for nothing
but to look at

SpanishOysters
Spanish Oysters have a very thin Shell and rough on the outside
They are very good ShellFish and so large that half a dozen
are enow to satisfy an hungry Stomach

Flattings
The Flattings are inclosed in a broad thin Shell the whole Fish being flat
They are inferiour to no ShellFish this Country affords

FingerFish
FingerFish are very plentiful in this Country they are
of the Length of a Mans Finger and lie in the Bottom of the Water
about one or two Foot deep They are very good

Shrimps
Shrimps are here very plentiful and good and are to be taken
with a SmallBowNet in great Quantities

SmallCockles
The small Cockles are about the Bigness of the largest English Cockles
and differ nothing from them unless in the Shells which are striped
crosswise as well as longwise

The FreshWater ShellFish are

Muscles
Muscles which are eaten by the Indians after five or six hours Boiling
to make them tender and then are good for nothing

CrawFish
CrawFish in the Brooks and small Rivers of Water
amongst the Tuskeruro Indians and up higher are found very plentifully
and as good as any in the World

And thus I have gone through the several Species of Fish
so far as they have come to my Knowledge in the eight Years
that I have lived in Carolina I should have made a larger Discovery
when travelling so far towards the Mountains and amongst the Hills
had it not been in the WinterSeason which was improper to make any Enquiry
into any of the Species before recited Therefore as my Intent was
I proceed to what remains of the Present State of Carolina having already
accounted for the Animals and Vegetables as far as this Volume
would allow of whereby the Remainder though not exactly known
may yet be guessd at if we consider what Latitude Carolina lies in
which reaches from 29 to 36 deg 30 min Northern Latitude
as I have before observd Which Latitude is as fertile and pleasant
as any in the World as well for the Produce of Minerals
Fruit Grain and Wine as other rich Commodities And indeed
all the Experiments that have been made in Carolina
of the Fertility and natural Advantages of the Country
have exceeded all Expectation as affording some Commodities
which other Places in the same Latitude do not As for Minerals
as they are subterraneous Products so in all new Countries
they are the Species that are last discoverd and especially
in Carolina where the Indians never look for any thing
lower than the Superficies of the Earth being a Race of Men
the least addicted to delving of any People that inhabit so fine a Country
as Carolina is As good if not better Mines than those
the Spaniards possess in America lie full West from us and I am certain
we have as Mountainous Land and as great Probability of having rich Minerals
in Carolina as any of those Parts that are already found
to be so rich therein But waving this Subject till some other Opportunity
I shall now give you some Observations in general concerning Carolina
which are first that it lies as convenient for Trade
as any of the Plantations in America that we have Plenty of Pitch Tar
Skins of Deer and Beeves Furs Rice Wheat Rie Indian Grain
sundry sorts of Pulse Turpentine Rozin Masts Yards Planks and Boards
Staves and Lumber Timber of many common sorts fit for any Uses
Hemp Flax Barley Oats BuckWheat Beef Pork Tallow Hides
WhaleBone and Oil Wax Cheese Butter c besides Drugs Dyes
Fruit Silk Cotton Indico Oil and Wine that we need not doubt of
as soon as we make a regular Essay the Country being adornd
with pleasant Meadows Rivers Mountains Valleys Hills and rich Pastures
and blessed with wholesome pure Air especially a little backwards
from the Sea where the wild Beasts inhabit none of which are voracious
The Men are active the Women fruitful to Admiration every House
being full of Children and several Women that have come hither barren
having presently provd fruitful There cannot be a richer Soil
no Place abounding more in Flesh and Fowl both wild and tame
besides Fish Fruit Grain Cider and many other pleasant Liquors
together with several other Necessaries for Life and Trade
that are daily found out as new Discoveries are made The Stone and Gout
seldom trouble us the Consumption we are wholly Strangers to
no Place affording a better Remedy for that Distemper
than Carolina For Trade we lie so near to Virginia
that we have the Advantage of their Convoys as also Letters from thence
in two or three Days at most in some Places in as few Hours
Add to this that the great Number of Ships which come within those Capes
for Virginia and Maryland take off our Provisions
and give us Bills of Exchange for England which is Sterling Money
The Planters in Virginia and Maryland are forcd to do the same
the great Quantities of Tobacco that are planted there
making Provisions scarce and Tobacco is a Commodity oftentimes so low
as to bring nothing whereas Provisions and Naval Stores
never fail of a Market Besides where these are raised
in such Plenty as in Carolina there always appears good Housekeeping
and Plenty of all manner of delicate Eatables For Instance
the Pork of Carolina is very good the younger Hogs fed on Peaches Maiz
and such other natural Produce being some of the sweetest Meat
that the World affords as is acknowledged by all Strangers
that have been there And as for the Beef in Pampticough
and the Southward Parts it proves extraordinary We have not only
Provisions plentiful but Cloaths of our own Manufactures which are made
and daily increase Cotton Wool Hemp and Flax being of our own Growth
and the Women to be highly commended for their Industry in Spinning
and ordering their Houswifry to so great Advantage as they generally do
which is much more easy by reason this happy Climate
visited with so mild Winters is much warmer than the Northern Plantations
which saves abundance of Cloaths fewer serving our Necessities
and those of our Servants But this is not all for we can go out
with our Commodities to any other Part of the WestIndies
or elsewhere in the Depth of Winter whereas those in NewEngland
NewYork Pensylvania and the Colonies to the Northward of us
cannot stir for Ice but are fast lockd into their Harbours
Besides we can trade with SouthCarolina and pay no Duties or Customs
no more than their own Vessels both North and South being under
the same LordsProprietors We have as I observd before
another great Advantage in not being a Frontier and so continually alarmd
by the Enemy and what has been accounted a Detriment to us
proves one of the greatest Advantages any People could wish which is
our Countrys being faced with a Sound near ten Leagues over in some Places
through which although there be Water enough for as large Ships
to come in at as in any part hitherto seated in both Carolinas
yet the Difficulty of that Sound to Strangers hinders them from attempting
any Hostilities against us and at the same time if we consider
the Advantages thereof nothing can appear to be a better Situation
than to be fronted with such a Bulwark which secures us from our Enemies
Furthermore our Distance from the Sea rids us of two Curses
which attend most other Parts of America viz Muskeetos
and the Wormbiting which eats Ships Bottoms out whereas at BathTown
there is no such thing known and as for Muskeetos they hinder us
of as little Rest as they do you in England Add to this
the unaccountable Quantities of Fish this great Water or Sound
supplies us withal whenever we take the Pains to fish for them
Advantages I have no where met withal in America except here
As for the Climate we enjoy a very wholsome and serene Sky
and a pure and thin Air the Sun seldom missing to give us his daily Blessing
unless now and then on a Winters Day which is not often and when cloudy
the first Appearance of a NorthWest Wind clears the Horizon
and restores the Light of the Sun The Weather in Summer is very pleasant
the hotter Months being refreshd with continual Breezes of cool reviving Air
and the Spring being as pleasant and beautiful as in any Place
I ever was in The Winter most commonly is so mild
that it looks like an Autumn being now and then attended
with clear and thin NorthWest Winds that are sharp enough to regulate
English Constitutions and free them from a great many dangerous Distempers
that a continual Summer afflicts them withal nothing being wanting
as to the natural Ornaments and Blessings of a Country
that conduce to make reasonable Men happy And for those that are otherwise
they are so much their own Enemies where they are that they will scarce ever
be any ones Friends or their own when they are transplanted
so its much better for all sides that they remain as they are
Not but that there are several good People that upon just Grounds
may be uneasy under their present Burdens and such I would advise
to remove to the Place I have been treating of where they may enjoy
their Liberty and Religion and peaceably eat the Fruits of their Labour
and drink the Wine of their own Vineyards without the Alarms
of a troublesome worldly Life If a Man be a Botanist
here is a plentiful Field of Plants to divert him in If he be a Gardner
and delight in that pleasant and happy Life he will meet with
a Climate and Soil that will further and promote his Designs
in as great a Measure as any Man can wish for and as for
the Constitution of this Government it is so mild and easy
in respect to the Properties and Liberties of a Subject
that without rehearsing the Particulars I say once for all
it is the mildest and best establishd Government in the World
and the Place where any Man may peaceably enjoy his own
without being invaded by another Rank and Superiority ever giving Place
to Justice and Equity which is the Golden Rule that every Government
ought to be built upon and regulated by Besides it is worthy our Notice
that this Province has been settled and continued the most free
from the Insults and Barbarities of the Indians of any Colony
that was ever yet seated in America which must be esteemd
as a particular Providence of God handed down from Heaven to these People
especially when we consider how irregularly they settled NorthCarolina
and yet how undisturbd they have ever remaind free from any foreign
Danger or Loss even to this very Day And what may well be lookd upon
for as great a Miracle this is a Place where no Malefactors are found
deserving Death or even a Prison for Debtors there being no more
than two Persons that as far as I have been able to learn
ever sufferd as Criminals although it has been a Settlement
near sixty Years One of whom was a Turk that committed Murder
the other an old Woman for Witchcraft These tis true
were on the Stage and acted many Years before I knew the Place
but as for the last I wish it had been undone to this day
although they give a great many Arguments to justifie the Deed
which I had rather they should have a Hand in than myself
seeing I could never approve of taking Life away upon such Accusations
the Justice whereof I could never yet understand

But to return to the Subject in Hand we there make extraordinary good Bricks
throughout the Settlement All sorts of Handicrafts as Carpenters Joiners
Masons Plaisterers Shooemakers Tanners Taylors Weavers and most others
may with small Beginnings and Gods Blessing thrive very well
in this Place and provide Estates for their Children Land being sold
at a much cheaper Rate there than in any other Place in America and may
as I suppose be purchased of the LordsProprietors here in England
or of the Governour there for the time being by any that shall have a mind
to transport themselves to that Country The Farmers that go thither
for which sort of Men it is a very thriving Place should take with them
some particular Seeds of Grass as Trefoil Clovergrass all sorts
Sanfoin and Common Grass or that which is a Rarity in Europe especially
what has sprung and rose first from a warm Climate and will endure the Sun
without flinching Likewise if there be any extraordinary sort of Grain
for Increase or Hardiness and some FruitTrees of choice Kinds
they will be both profitable and pleasant to have with you
where you may see the Fruits of your Labour in Perfection
in a few Years The necessary Instruments of Husbandry
I need not acquaint the Husbandman withal Hoes of all sorts
and Axes must be had with Saws Wedges Augurs Nails Hammers
and what other Things may be necessary for building with Brick
or Stone which sort your Inclination and Conveniency lead you to
For after having lookd over this Treatise you must needs be acquainted
with the Nature of the Country and therefore cannot but be Judges what it is
that you will chiefly want As for Land none need want it for taking up
even in the Places there seated on the Navigable Creeks Rivers and Harbours
without being driven into remoter Holes and Corners of the Country
for Settlements which all are forced to do who at this day
settle in most or all of the other English Plantations in America
which are already become so populous that a NewComer cannot get
a beneficial and commodious Seat unless he purchases when
in most Places in Virginia and Maryland a thousand Acres of good Land
seated on a Navigable Water will cost a thousand Pounds whereas with us
it is at present obtaind for the fiftieth Part of the Money
Besides our Land pays to the Lords but an easy QuitRent
or yearly Acknowledgement and the other Settlements pay
two Shillings per hundred All these things duly weighed
any rational Man that has a mind to purchase Land in the Plantations
for a Settlement of himself and Family will soon discover
the Advantages that attend the Settlers and Purchasers of Land in Carolina
above all other Colonies in the English Dominions in America
And as there is a free Exercise of all Persuasions amongst Christians
the LordsProprietors to encourage Ministers of the Church of England
have given free Land towards the Maintenance of a Church and especially
for the Parish of S Thomas in Pampticough overagainst the Town
is already laid out for a Glebe of two hundred and twenty three Acres
of rich wellsituated Land that a ParsonageHouse may be built upon
And now I shall proceed to give an Account of the Indians
their Customs and Ways of Living with a short Dictionary of their Speech





 An
 ACCOUNT
 of the
 INDIANS
 of
 NORTHCAROLINA



The Indians which were the Inhabitants of America when the Spaniards
and other Europeans discoverd the several Parts of that Country
are the People which we reckon the Natives thereof as indeed they were
when we first found out those Parts and appeard therein
Yet this has not wrought in me a full Satisfaction to allow these People
to have been the Ancient Dwellers of the NewWorld or Tract of Land
we call America The Reasons that I have to think otherwise
are too many to set down here but I shall give the Reader a few
before I proceed and some others he will find scatterd
in my Writings elsewhere

In Carolina the Part I now treat of are the fairest Marks of a Deluge
that at some time has probably made strange Alterations
as to the Station that Country was then in that ever I saw
or I think read of in any History Wood under Ground
Amongst the other Subterraneous Matters that have been discoverd
we found in digging of a Well that was twenty six foot deep
at the Bottom thereof many large Pieces of the TulipTree
and several other sorts of Wood some of which were cut and notchd
and some squared as the Joices of a House are which appeard
in the Judgment of all that saw them to be wrought with Iron Instruments
it seeming impossible for any thing made of Stone or what they were found
to make use of to cut Wood in that manner It cannot be argud
that the Wood so cut might float from some other Continent
because Hiccory and the TulipTree are spontaneous in America
and in no other Places that I could ever learn Shells some Fathoms
in the Earth the Sea probably has thrown up in part of this Country
Mexico Buildings It is to be acknowledgd that the Spaniards
give us Relations of magnificent Buildings which were raised
by the Indians of Mexico and other Parts which they discoverd
and conquerd amongst whom no Iron Instruments were found
But tis a great Misfortune that no Person in that Expedition was so curious
as to take an exact Draught of the Fabricks of those People
which would have been a Discovery of great Value and very acceptable
to the Ingenious for as to the Politeness of Stones it may be effected
by Collision and Grinding which is of a contrary Nature
on several Accounts and disproves not my Arguments in the least

Earthen Pots under Ground
The next is the Earthen Pots that are often found under Ground
and at the Foot of the Banks where the Water has washd them away They are
for the most part broken in pieces but we find them of a different sort
in Comparison of those the Indians use at this day who have had no other
ever since the English discoverd America The Bowels of the Earth
cannot have alterd them since they are thicker of another Shape
and Composition and nearly approach to the Urns of the Ancient Romans

Indian Peaches
Again the Peaches which are the only tame Fruit or what is Foreign
that these People enjoy which is an Eastern Product and will keep and retain
its vegetative and growing Faculty the longest of any thing of that Nature
that I know of The Stone WaterMelon and Gourds the Indians
have always had The Stone as I elsewhere have remarkd is thicker
than any other sort of the Peaches in Europe or of the European sort
now growing in America and is observed to grow if planted
after it has been for several Years laid by and it seems very probable
that these People might come from some Eastern Country for when you ask them
whence their ForeFathers came that first inhabited the Country
they will point to the Westward and say Where the Sun sleeps
our Forefathers came thence which at that distance may be reckond
amongst the Eastern Parts of the World And to this day
they are a shifting wandring People for I know some Indian Nations
that have changd their Settlements many hundred Miles
sometimes no less than a thousand as is provd by the Savanna Indians
who formerly lived on the Banks of the Messiasippi and removd thence
to the Head of one of the Rivers of SouthCarolina since which
for some Dislike most of them are removd to live in the Quarters
of the Iroquois or Sinnagars which are on the Heads of the Rivers
that disgorge themselves into the Bay of Chesapeak I once met
with a young Indian Woman that had been brought from beyond the Mountains
and was sold a Slave into Virginia She spoke the same Language
as the Coranine Indians that dwell near CapeLookout
allowing for some few Words which were different yet no otherwise
than that they might understand one another very well

Indian well shapd People
The Indians of NorthCarolina are a wellshapd cleanmade People
of different Statures as the Europeans are yet chiefly inclind
to be tall They are a very streight People and never bend forwards
or stoop in the Shoulders unless much overpowerd by old Age
Their Limbs are exceeding wellshapd As for their Legs and Feet
they are generally the handsomest in the World Their Bodies are
a little flat which is occasiond by being laced hard down to a Board
in their Infancy This is all the Cradle they have which I shall
describe at large elsewhere Their Eyes are black or of a dark Hazle
The White is marbled with red Streaks which is ever common to these People
unless when sprung from a white Father or Mother Their Colour is of a tawny
which would not be so dark did they not dawb themselves with Bears Oil
and a Colour like burnt Cork This is begun in their Infancy
and continued for a long time which fills the Pores and enables them better
to endure the Extremity of the Weather They are never bald on their Heads
although never so old which I believe proceeds from their Heads
being always uncoverd and the greasing their Hair so often as they do
with Bears Fat which is a great Nourisher of the Hair and causes it
to grow very fast Amongst the Bears Oil when they intend to be fine
they mix a certain red Powder that comes from a Scarlet Root which they get
in the hilly Country near the Foot of the great Ridge of Mountains
and it is no where else to be found They have this Scarlet Root
in great Esteem and sell it for a very great Price one to another
The Reason of its Value is because they not only go a long way for it
but are in great Danger of the Sinnagars or Iroquois
who are mortal Enemies to all our Indians and very often
take them Captives or kill them before they return from this Voyage
The Tuskeruros and other Indians have often brought this Seed
with them from the Mountains but it would never grow in our Land
With this and Bears Grease they anoint their Heads and Temples
which is esteemd as ornamental as sweet Powder to our Hair
Besides this Root has the Virtue of killing Lice and suffers none
to abide or breed in their Heads For want of this Root
they sometimes use PecoonRoot which is of a Crimson Colour
but it is apt to die the Hair of an ugly Hue

Their Eyes are commonly full and manly and their Gate sedate and majestick
They never walk backward and forward as we do nor contemplate
on the Affairs of Loss and Gain the things which daily perplex us
They are dexterous and steady both as to their Hands and Feet to Admiration
They will walk over deep Brooks and Creeks on the smallest Poles
and that without any Fear or Concern Nay an Indian will walk
on the Ridge of a Barn or House and look down the Gableend
and spit upon the Ground as unconcernd as if he was walking
on Terra firma In Running Leaping or any such other Exercise
their Legs seldom miscarry and give them a Fall and as for letting
any thing fall out of their Hands I never yet knew one Example
They are no Inventers of any Arts or Trades worthy mention
the Reason of which I take to be that they are not possessd
with that Care and Thoughtfulness how to provide for the Necessaries of Life
as the Europeans are yet they will learn any thing very soon
I have known an Indian stock Guns better than most of our Joiners
although he never saw one stockd before and besides his WorkingTool
was only a sorry Knife I have also known several of them that were Slaves
to the English learn HandicraftTrades very well and speedily No Dwarf
I never saw a Dwarf amongst them nor but one that was Humpbackd
Their Teeth are yellow with Smoaking Tobacco which both Men and Women
are much addicted to They tell us that they had Tobacco amongst them
before the Europeans made any Discovery of that Continent
It differs in the Leaf from the sweetscented and Oroonoko
which are the Plants we raise and cultivate in America Indian Tobacco
Theirs differs likewise much in the Smell when green from our Tobacco
before cured They do not use the same way to cure it as we do
and therefore the Difference must be very considerable in Taste
for all Men that know Tobacco must allow that it is the Ordering thereof
which gives a Hogoo to that Weed rather than any Natural Relish it possesses
when green Although they are great Smokers yet they never are seen
to take it in Snuff or chew it

They have no Hairs on their Faces except some few and those but little
nor is there often found any Hair under their ArmPits
They are continually plucking it away from their Faces by the Roots
As for their Privities since they wore TailClouts
to cover their Nakedness several of the Men have a deal of Hair thereon
It is to be observd that the Head of the Penis is coverd
throughout all the Nations of the Indians I ever saw
both in Old and Young Although we reckon these a very smooth People
and free from Hair yet I once saw a middleaged Man that was hairy
all down his Back the Hairs being above an Inch long

Few Cripples
As there are found very few or scarce any Deformed or Cripples
amongst them so neither did I ever see but one blind Man
and then they would give me no Account how his Blindness came
They had a Use for him which was to lead him with a Girl Woman or Boy
by a String so they put what Burdens they pleased upon his Back
and made him very serviceable upon all such Occasions Indians good Eyes
No People have better Eyes or see better in the Night or Day
than the Indians Some alledge that the Smoke of the PitchPine
which they chiefly burn does both preserve and strengthen the Eyes
as perhaps it may do because that Smoak never offends the Eyes
though you hold your Face over a great Fire thereof This is occasiond
by the volatile Part of the Turpentine which rises with the Smoke
and is of a friendly balsamick Nature for the Ashes of the PineTree
afford no fixd Salt in them

Not pair their Nails
They let their Nails grow very long which they reckon
is the Use Nails are designd for and laugh at the Europeans
for pairing theirs which they say disarms them of that which Nature
designd them for

Indians not robust
They are not of so robust and strong Bodies as to lift great Burdens
and endure Labour and slavish Work as the Europeans are
yet some that are Slaves prove very good and laborious
No hard Workers But of themselves they never work as the English do
taking care for no farther than what is absolutely necessary to support Life
In Travelling and Hunting they are very indefatigable
because that carries a Pleasure along with the Profit
I have known some of them very strong and as for Running and Leaping
they are extraordinary Fellows and will dance for several Nights together
with the greatest Briskness imaginable their Wind never failing them

Indians Dance of War On what Account they make War
Their Dances are of different Natures and for every sort of Dance
they have a Tune which is allotted for that Dance as
if it be a WarDance they have a warlike Song wherein they express
with all the Passion and Vehemence imaginable what they intend to do
with their Enemies how they will kill roast sculp beat and make Captive
such and such Numbers of them and how many they have destroyd before
All these Songs are made new for every Feast nor is one and the same Song
sung at two several Festivals Indian Poet Some one of the Nation
which has the best Gift of expressing their Designs is appointed
by their King and WarCaptains to make these Songs

Dance of Peace
Others are made for Feasts of another Nature as when several Towns
or sometimes different Nations have made Peace with one another
then the Song suits both Nations and relates how the bad Spirit
made them go to War and destroy one another but it shall never be so again
but that their Sons and Daughters shall marry together and the two Nations
love one another and become as one People

They have a third sort of Feasts and Dances which are always
when the Harvest of Corn is ended and in the Spring The one
to return Thanks to the good Spirit for the Fruits of the Earth
the other to beg the same Blessings for the succeeding Year
And to encourage the young Men to labour stoutly in planting
their Maiz and Pulse they set a sort of an Idol in the Field
which is dressd up exactly like an Indian having all the Indians Habit
besides abundance of Wampum and their Money made of Shells
that hangs about his Neck Plantation Idol The Image
none of the young Men dare approach for the old ones will not suffer them
to come near him but tell them that he is some famous Indian Warriour
that died a great while ago and now is come amongst them
to see if they work well which if they do he will go to the good Spirit
and speak to him to send them Plenty of Corn and to make the young Men
all expert Hunters and mighty Warriours All this while
the King and old Men sit round the Image and seemingly pay
a profound Respect to the same One great Help to these Indians
in carrying on these Cheats and inducing Youth to do what they please
is the uninterrupted Silence which is ever kept and observd
with all the Respect and Veneration imaginable

Masquerade
At these Feasts which are set out with all the Magnificence
their Fare allows of the Masquerades begin at Night and not before
There is commonly a Fire made in the middle of the House which is the largest
in the Town and is very often the Dwelling of their King or WarCaptain
where sit two Men on the Ground upon a Mat one with a Rattle
made of a Gourd with some Beans in it the other with a Drum
made of an earthen Pot coverd with a dressdDeerSkin
and one Stick in his Hand to beat thereon and so they both begin
the Song appointed Indian Musicians At the same time one drums
and the other rattles which is all the artificial Musick of their own making
I ever saw amongst them To these two Instruments they sing
which carries no Air with it but is a sort of unsavoury Jargon
yet their Cadences and Raising of their Voices are formd
with that Equality and Exactness that to us Europeans it seems admirable
how they should continue these Songs without once missing to agree
each with the others Note and Tune

Dancing
As for their Dancing were there Masters of that Profession amongst them
as there are with us they would dearly earn their Money
for these Creatures take the most Pains at it that Men are able to endure
I have seen thirty odd together a dancing and every one
droppd down with Sweat as if Water had been poured down their Backs
They use those hard Labours to make them able to endure Fatigue
Indians long winded and improve their Wind which indeed
is very long and durable it being a hard matter in any Exercise
to dispossess them of it

At these Feasts they meet from all the Towns within fifty or sixty
Miles round where they buy and sell several Commodities as we do
at Fairs and Markets Indian Gaming Besides they game very much
and often strip one another of all they have in the World and what is more
I have known several of them play themselves away so that they have
remaind the Winners Servants till their Relations or themselves
could pay the Money to redeem them and when this happens
the Loser is never dejected or melancholy at the Loss but laughs
and seems no less contented than if he had won They never differ at Gaming
neither did I ever see a Dispute about the Legality thereof
so much as rise amongst them

Indian Cards
Their chiefest Game is a sort of Arithmetick which is managed
by a Parcel of small split Reeds the Thickness of a small Bent
these are made very nicely so that they part and are tractable
in their Hands They are fifty one in Number their Length
about seven Inches when they play they throw part of them
to their Antagonist the Art is to discover upon sight how many you have
and what you throw to him that plays with you Some are so expert
at their Numbers that they will tell ten times together
what they throw out of their Hands Although the whole Play is carried on
with the quickest Motion its possible to use yet some are so expert
at this Game as to win great Indian Estates by this Play
A good Sett of these Reeds fit to play withal are valued and sold
for a dressd DoeSkin

Indian Dice
They have several other Plays and Games as with the Kernels or Stones
of Persimmons which are in effect the same as our Dice
because Winning or Losing depend on which side appear uppermost
and how they happen to fall together

Indian TrapBall
Another Game is managed with a Batoon and a Ball and resembles our Trapball
besides several Nations have several Games and Pastimes
which are not used by others

Indian Cabins
These Savages live in Wigwams or Cabins built of Bark which are made round
like an Oven to prevent any Damage by hard Gales of Wind They make the Fire
in the middle of the House and have a Hole at the Top of the Roof
right above the Fire to let out the Smoke These Dwellings
are as hot as Stoves where the Indians sleep and sweat all Night
The Floors thereof are never paved nor swept so that they have always
a loose Earth on them Fleas They are often troubled
with a multitude of Fleas especially near the Places where
they dress their DeerSkins because that Hair harbours them
yet I never felt any ill unsavory Smell in their Cabins
whereas should we live in our Houses as they do we should be poisond
with our own Nastiness Indians a sweet People which confirms
these Indians to be as they really are some of the sweetest People
in the World

The Bark they make their Cabins withal is generally Cypress
or red or white Cedar and sometimes when they are a great way
from any of these Woods they make use of PineBark which is the worser sort
Making Cabins In building these Fabricks they get very long Poles
of Pine Cedar Hiccory or any Wood that will bend these are
the Thickness of the Small of a Mans Leg at the thickest end
which they generally strip of the Bark and warm them well in the Fire
which makes them tough and fit to bend afterwards they stick
the thickest ends of them in the Ground about two Yards asunder
in a Circular Form the distance they design the Cabin to be
which is not always round but sometimes oval then they bend the Tops
and bring them together and bind their ends with Bark of Trees
that is proper for that use as Elm is Black Moss or sometimes the Moss
that grows on the Trees and is a Yard or two long and never rots
then they brace them with other Poles to make them strong afterwards
cover them all over with Bark so that they are very warm and tight
and will keep firm against all the Weathers that blow
Indians StoreHouses They have other sorts of Cabins without Windows
which are for their Granaries Skins and Merchandizes
and others that are coverd over head the rest left open for the Air
Indians Banqueting Houses These have ReedHurdles like Tables
to lie and sit on in Summer and serve for pleasant BanquetingHouses
in the hot Season of the Year The Cabins they dwell in have Benches
all round except where the Door stands on these they lay BeastsSkins
and Mats made of Rushes whereon they sleep and loll In one of these
several Families commonly live though all related to one another

As to the Indians Food it is of several sorts which are as follows

Indian Food
Venison and Fawns in the Bags cut out of the Does Belly
Fish of all sorts the LampreyEel excepted and the Sturgeon
our SaltWater Indians will not touch Bear and Bever Panther Polecat
Wildcat Possum Raccoon Hares and Squirrels roasted with their Guts in
Snakes all Indians will not eat them tho some do All wild Fruits
that are palatable some of which they dry and keep against Winter
as all sort of Fruits and Peaches which they dry and make Quiddonies
and Cakes that are very pleasant and a little tartish
young Wasps when they are white in the Combs before they can fly
this is esteemed a Dainty All sorts of Tortois and Terebins
ShellFish and Stingray or Scate dryd Gourds Melons Cucumbers
Squashes Pulse of all sorts Rockahomine Meal which is their Maiz
parchd and pounded into Powder Fowl of all sorts that are eatable
GroundNuts or wild Potatos Acorns and Acorn Oil WildBulls Beef
Mutton Pork c from the English Indian Corn or Maiz
made into several sorts of Bread Ears of Corn roasted in the Summer
or preservd against Winter

The Victuals is common throughout the whole Kindred Relations
and often to the whole Town especially when they are in HuntingQuarters
then they all fare alike whichsoever of them kills the Game
Feasts of Charity Indians discern not between fat and lean Meat
They are very kind and charitable to one another but more especially
to those of their own Nation for if any one of them has sufferd any Loss
by Fire or otherwise they order the grievd Person to make a Feast
and invite them all thereto which on the day appointed they come to
and after every Mans Mess of Victuals is dealt to him one of their Speakers
or grave old Men makes an Harangue and acquaints the Company
That that Mans House has been burnt wherein all his Goods were destroyd
That he and his Family very narrowly escaped That he is every Mans Friend
in that Company and That it is all their Duties to help him
as he would do to any of them had the like Misfortune befallen them
After this Oration is over every Man according to his Quality
throws him down upon the Ground some Present which is commonly Beads
Ronoak Peak Skins or Furs and which very often amounts to treble
the Loss he has sufferd The same Assistance they give to any Man
that wants to build a Cabin or make a Canoe They say it is our Duty
thus to do for there are several Works that one Man cannot effect
therefore we must give him our Help otherwise our Society will fall
and we shall be deprivd of those urgent Necessities which Life requires
Indians no Fences They have no Fence to part one anothers Lots
in their CornFields but every Man knows his own and it scarce ever happens
that they rob one another of so much as an Ear of Corn
which if any is found to do he is sentenced by the Elders
to work and plant for him that was robbd till he is recompensed
for all the Damage he has sufferd in his CornField
and this is punctually performd and the Thief held in Disgrace
that steals from any of his CountryFolks Indians Charity to Widows
It often happens that a Woman is destitute of her Husband
and has a great many Children to maintain such a Person they always help
and make their young men plant reap and do every thing
that she is not capable of doing herself yet they do not allow any one
to be idle but to employ themselves in some Work or other

Indian Women no Scolds
They never fight with one another unless drunk nor do you ever hear
any Scolding amongst them They say the Europeans are always
rangling and uneasy and wonder they do not go out of this World since they
are so uneasy and discontented in it All their Misfortunes and Losses
end in Laughter for if their Cabins take Fire and all their Goods
are burnt therein indeed all will strive to prevent farther Damage
whilst there is any Possibility yet such a Misfortune ends
in a hearty Fitt of Laughter unless some of their Kinsfolks and Friends
have lost their Lives but then the Case is alterd and they become
very pensive and go into deep Mourning which is continued
for a considerable Time sometimes longer or shorter according to
the Dignity of the Person and the Number of Relations he had near him

The Burial of their Dead is performd with a great deal of Ceremony
in which one Nation differs in some few Circumstances from another
yet not so much but we may by a general Relation pretty nearly account
for them all

Indian Burial of their Dead
When an Indian is dead the greater Person he was the more expensive
is his Funeral The first thing which is done is to place
the nearest Relations near the Corps who mourn and weep very much
having their Hair hanging down their Shoulders in a very forlorn manner
After the dead Person has lain a Day and a Night in one of their
Hurdles of Canes commonly in some OutHouse made for that purpose
those that officiate about the Funeral go into the Town and the first
young Men they meet withal that have Blankets or Match Coats on
whom they think fit for their Turn they strip them from their Backs
who suffer them so to do without any Resistance In these
they wrap the dead Bodies and cover them with two or three Mats
which the Indians make of Rushes or Cane and last of all
they have a long Web of woven Reeds or hollow Canes which is
the Coffin of the Indians and is brought round several times
and tied fast at both ends which indeed looks very decent and well
Then the Corps is brought out of the House into the Orchard of PeachTrees
where another Hurdle is made to receive it about which comes
all the Relations and Nation that the dead Person belongd to
besides several from other Nations in Alliance with them
all which sit down on the Ground upon Mats spread there for that purpose
where the Doctor or Conjurer appears and after some time
makes a Sort of Oyes at which all are very silent then he begins
to give an Account who the dead Person was and how stout a Man
he approvd himself how many Enemies and Captives he had killd and taken
how strong tall and nimble he was that he was a great Hunter
a Lover of his Country and possessd of a great many beautiful
Wives and Children esteemd the greatest of Blessings among these Savages
in which they have a true Notion Indian Funeral Sermon
Thus this Orator runs on highly extolling the dead Man
for his Valour Conduct Strength Riches and GoodHumour
and enumerating his Guns Slaves and almost every thing
he was possessd of when living After which he addresses himself
to the People of that Town or Nation and bids them supply
the dead Mans Place by following his steps who he assures them
is gone into the Country of Souls which they think lies a great way off
in this World which the Sun visits in his ordinary Course
and that he will have the Enjoyment of handsome young Women
great Store of Deer to hunt never meet with Hunger Cold or Fatigue
but every thing to answer his Expectation and Desire
This is the Heaven they propose to themselves but on the contrary
for those Indians that are lazy thievish amongst themselves
bad Hunters and no Warriours nor of much Use to the Nation
to such they allot in the next World Hunger Cold Troubles old ugly Women
for their Companions with Snakes and all sorts of nasty Victuals to feed on
Thus is markd out their Heaven and Hell Indian Traditions
After all this Harangue he diverts the People with some of their Traditions
as when there was a violent hot Summer or very hard Winter
when any notable Distempers ragd amongst them when they were at War
with such and such Nations how victorious they were and what were
the Names of their WarCaptains To prove the times more exactly
he produces the Records of the Country which are a Parcel of Reeds
of different Lengths with several distinct Marks known to none
but themselves by which they seem to guess very exactly
at Accidents that happend many Years ago nay two or three Ages or more
The Reason I have to believe what they tell me on this Account
is because I have been at the Meetings of several Indian Nations
and they agreed in relating the same Circumstances as to Time
very exactly A hard Winter as for Example they say
there was so hard a Winter in Carolina 105 years ago
that the great Sound was frozen over and the Wild Geese came into the Woods
to eat Acorns and that they were so tame I suppose through Want
that they killd abundance in the Woods by knocking them on the Head
with Sticks

But to return to the dead Man When this long Tale is ended
by him that spoke first perhaps a second begins another long Story
so a third and fourth if there be so many Doctors present
which all tell one and the same thing At last the Corps is brought away
from that Hurdle to the Grave by four young Men attended by the Relations
the King old Men and all the Nation Interment in the Grave
When they come to the Sepulcre which is about six Foot deep
and eight Foot long having at each end that is at the Head and Foot
a LightWood or PitchPine Fork driven close down the sides of the Grave
firmly into the Ground these two Forks are to contain a RidgePole
as you shall understand presently before they lay the Corps into the Grave
they cover the bottom two or three times over with Bark of Trees
then they let down the Corps with two Belts that the Indians
carry their Burdens withal very leisurely upon the said Barks
then they lay over a Pole of the same Wood in the two Forks and having
a great many Pieces of PitchPine Logs about two Foot and a half long
they stick them in the sides of the Grave down each End
and near the Top thereof where the other Ends lie on the RidgePole
so that they are declining like the Roof of a House These being
very thickplacd they cover them many times double with Bark
then they throw the Earth thereon that came out of the Grave
and beat it down very firm by this Means the dead Body lies in a Vault
nothing touching him so that when I saw this way of Burial
I was mightily pleasd with it esteeming it very decent and pretty
as having seen a great many Christians buried without
the tenth Part of that Ceremony and Decency Quiogozon Idols
Now when the Flesh is rotted and moulderd from the Bone
they take up the Carcass and clean the Bones and joint them together
afterwards they dress them up in pure white dressd DeerSkins
and lay them amongst their Grandees and Kings in the Quiogozon
which is their Royal Tomb or BurialPlace of their Kings and WarCaptains
This is a very large magnificent Cabin according to their Building
which is raisd at the Publick Charge of the Nation and maintaind
in a great deal of Form and Neatness Idols at the Beds
About seven foot high is a Floor or Loft made on which lie
all their Princes and Great Men that have died for several hundred Years
all attird in the Dress I before told you of No Person is to have
his Bones lie here and to be thus dressd unless he gives
a round Sum of their Money to the Rulers for Admittance
If they remove never so far to live in a Foreign Country
they never fail to take all these dead Bones along with them
though the Tediousness of their short daily Marches keeps them never so long
on their Journey They reverence and adore this Quiogozon
with all the Veneration and Respect that is possible for such a People
to discharge and had rather lose all than have any Violence or Injury
offerd thereto These Savages differ some small matter in their Burials
some burying right upwards and otherwise as you are acquainted withal
in my Journal from South to North Carolina Mourning for the Dead
Yet they all agree in their Mourning which is to appear every Night
at the Sepulcre and howl and weep in a very dismal manner having their Faces
dawbd over with Lightwood Soot which is the same as Lampblack
and Bears Oil This renders them as black as it is possible
to make themselves so that theirs very much resemble
the Faces of Executed Men boild in Tar Indians hired to mourn
If the dead Person was a Grandee to carry on the Funeral Ceremonies
they hire People to cry and lament over the dead Man Of this sort
there are several that practise it for a Livelihood and are very expert
at Shedding abundance of Tears and howling like Wolves
and so discharging their Office with abundance of Hypocrisy and Art
The Women are never accompanied with these Ceremonies after Death
and to what World they allot that Sex I never understood
unless to wait on their dead Husbands but they have more Wit
than some of the Eastern Nations who sacrifice themselves to accompany
their Husbands into the next World It is the dead Mans Relations by Blood
as his Uncles Brothers Sisters Cousins Sons and Daughters
that mourn in good earnest the Wives thinking their Duty is dischargd
and that they are become free when their Husband is dead
so as fast as they can look out for another to supply his Place

Indian Women handsome
As for the Indian Women which now happen in my Way when young
and at Maturity they are as fineshapd Creatures take them generally
as any in the Universe They are of a tawny Complexion
their Eyes very brisk and amorous their Smiles afford the finest Composure
a Face can possess their Hands are of the finest Make
with small long Fingers and as soft as their Cheeks and their whole Bodies
of a smooth Nature They are not so uncouth or unlikely as we suppose them
nor are they Strangers or not Proficients in the soft Passion
They are most of them mercenary except the married Women who sometimes
bestow their Favours also to some or other in their Husbands Absence
For which they never ask any Reward Married Women unconstant
As for the Report that they are never found unconstant like the Europeans
it is wholly false for were the old World and the new one put into
a Pair of Scales in point of Constancy it would be a hard Matter to discern
which was the heavier Trading Girls As for the Trading Girls
which are those designd to get Money by their Natural Parts
these are discernable by the Cut of their Hair their Tonsure differing
from all others of that Nation who are not of their Profession
which Method is intended to prevent Mistakes for the Savages of America
are desirous if possible to keep their Wives to themselves
as well as those in other Parts of the World When any Addresses are made
to one of these Girls she immediately acquaints her Parents therewith
and they tell the King of it provided he that courts her be a Stranger
his Majesty commonly being the principal Bawd of the Nation he rules over
and there seldom being any of these WinchesterWeddings agreed on
without his Royal Consent He likewise advises her what Bargain to make
and if it happens to be an Indian Trader that wants a Bedfellow
and has got Rum to sell be sure the King must have a large Dram for a Fee
to confirm the Match These Indians that are of the elder sort
when any such Question is put to them will debate the Matter
amongst themselves with all the Sobriety and Seriousness imaginable
every one of the Girls Relations arguing the Advantage or Detriment
that may ensue such a Nights Encounter all which is done
with as much Steadiness and Reality as if it was the greatest Concern
in the World and not so much as one Person shall be seen to smile
so long as the Debate holds making no Difference betwixt
an Agreement of this Nature and a Bargain of any other If they comply
with the Mens Desire then a particular Bed is provided for them
either in a Cabin by themselves or else all the young people turn out
to another Lodging that they may not spoil Sport and if the old People
are in the same Cabin along with them all Night they lie as unconcernd
as if they were so many Logs of Wood If it be an Indian of their own
Town or Neighbourhood that wants a Mistress he comes to none but the Girl
who receives what she thinks fit to ask him and so lies all Night with him
without the Consent of her Parents

Indian Traders what
The Indian Traders are those which travel and abide amongst the Indians
for a long space of time sometimes for a Year two or three
Indian Wives These Men have commonly their Indian Wives
whereby they soon learn the Indian Tongue keep a Friendship
with the Savages and besides the Satisfaction of a SheBedFellow
they find these Indian Girls very serviceable to them
on Account of dressing their Victuals and instructing em
in the Affairs and Customs of the Country Moreover such a Man gets
a great Trade with the Savages for when a Person that lives amongst them
is reservd from the Conversation of their Women tis impossible for him
ever to accomplish his Designs amongst that People

But one great Misfortune which oftentimes attends those that converse
with these Savage Women is that they get Children by them
which are seldom educated any otherwise than in a State of Infidelity
for it is a certain Rule and Custom amongst all the Savages of America
that I was ever acquainted withal to let the Children always fall
to the Womans Lot Children go with the Women for it often happens
that two Indians that have livd together as Man and Wife
in which Time they have had several Children if they part
and another Man possesses her all the Children go along with the Mother
and none with the Father And therefore on this Score
it ever seems impossible for the Christians to get their Children
which they have by these Indian Women away from them
whereby they might bring them up in the Knowledge of the Christian Principles
Nevertheless we often find that English Men and other Europeans
that have been accustomd to the Conversation of these savage Women
and their Way of Living have been so allurd with that careless sort of Life
as to be constant to their Indian Wife and her Relations
so long as they livd without ever desiring to return again
amongst the English although they had very fair Opportunities of Advantages
amongst their Countrymen of which sort I have known several

As for the Indian Marriages I have read and heard of a great deal
of Form and Ceremony used which I never saw nor yet could learn
in the Time I have been amongst them any otherwise than I shall here
give you an Account of which is as follows

Indian Marriage
When any young Indian has a Mind for such a Girl to his Wife
he or some one for him goes to the young Womans Parents if living
if not to her nearest Relations where they make Offers of the Match
betwixt the Couple The Relations reply they will consider of it
which serves for a sufficient Answer till there be a second Meeting
about the Marriage which is generally brought into Debate
before all the Relations that are old People on both Sides
and sometimes the King with all his great Men give their Opinions therein
If it be agreed on and the young Woman approve thereof for these Savages
never give their Children in Marriage without their own Consent
Indians buy their Wives the Man pays so much for his Wife
and the handsomer she is the greater Price she bears Now it often happens
that the Man has not so much of their Money ready as he is to pay
for his Wife but if they know him to be a good Hunter and that he can raise
the Sum agreed for in some few Moons or any little time they agree
she shall go along with him as betrothd but he is not to have
any Knowledge of her till the utmost Payment is dischargd
all which is punctually observd Thus they lie together under one Covering
for several Months and the Woman remains the same as she was
when she first came to him I doubt our Europeans would be apt
to break this Custom Indian Men not vigorous but the Indian Men
are not so vigorous and impatient in their Love as we are
Yet the Women are quite contrary and those Indian Girls
that have conversd with the English and other Europeans
never care for the Conversation of their own Countrymen afterwards

They never marry so near as a first Cousin and although there is nothing
more coveted amongst them than to marry a Woman of their own Nation
yet when the Nation consists of a very few People as now adays
it often happens so that they are all of them related to one another
then they look out for Husbands and Wives amongst Strangers
For if an Indian lies with his Sister or any very near Relation
his Body is burnt and his Ashes thrown into the River as unworthy
to remain on Earth yet an Indian is allowd to marry two Sisters
or his Brothers Wife Although these People are calld Savages
yet Sodomy is never heard of amongst them and they are so far
from the Practice of that beastly and loathsome Sin that they have
no Name for it in all their Language

The Marriages of these Indians are no farther binding
than the Man and Woman agree together Either of them has Liberty
to leave the other upon any frivolous Excuse they can make
yet whosoever takes the Woman that was another Mans before
and bought by him as they all are must certainly pay to her former Husband
whatsoever he gave for her Nay if she be a Widow and her Husband
died in Debt whosoever takes her to Wife pays all her Husbands Obligations
though never so many yet the Woman is not required to pay any thing
unless she is willing that was owing from her Husband so long as she
keeps Single But if a Man courts her for a Nights Lodging and obtains it
the Creditors will make him pay her Husbands Debts and he may
if he will take her for his Money or sell her to another for his Wife
Selling Wives I have seen several of these Bargains driven in a day
for you may see Men selling their Wives as Men do Horses in a Fair
a Man being allowd not only to change as often as he pleases
but likewise to have as many Wives as he is able to maintain
Indian many Wives I have often seen that very old Indian Men
that have been Grandees in their own Nation have had three or four
very likely young Indian Wives which I have much wondered at because to me
they seemd incapacitated to make good Use of one of them

Night Rambles
The young Men will go in the Night from one House to another to visit
the young Women in which sort of Rambles they will spend the whole Night
In their Addresses they find no Delays for if she is willing
to entertain the Man she gives him Encouragement and grants him Admittance
otherwise she withdraws her Face from him and says I cannot see you
either you or I must leave this Cabin and sleep somewhere else this Night

They are never to boast of their Intrigues with the Women If they do
none of the Girls value them ever after or admit of their Company
in their Beds This proceeds not on the score of Reputation
for there is no such thing on that account known amongst them
and although we may reckon them the greatest Libertines and most extravagant
in their Embraces yet they retain and possess a Modesty
that requires those Passions never to be divulged

Trading Girls marry at last
The Trading Girls after they have led that Course of Life for several Years
in which time they scarce ever have a Child for they have an Art
to destroy the Conception and she that brings a Child in this Station
is accounted a Fool and her Reputation is lessend thereby
at last they grow weary of so many and betake themselves to a married State
or to the Company of one Man neither does their having been common to so many
any wise lessen their Fortunes but rather augment them

Women not punishd for Adultery
The Woman is not punishd for Adultery but tis the Man that makes
the injurd Person Satisfaction which is the Law of Nations
practisd amongst them all and he that strives to evade such Satisfaction
as the Husband demands lives daily in Danger of his Life
yet when dischargd all Animosity is laid aside and the Cuckold
is very well pleased with his Bargain whilst the Rival is laughd at
by the whole Nation for carrying on his Intrigue with no better Conduct
than to be discoverd and pay so dear for his Pleasure

The Indians say that the Woman is a weak Creature and easily drawn away
by the Mans Persuasion for which Reason they lay no Blame upon her
but the Man that ought to be Master of his Passion for persuading her to it

Never Lovemad
They are of a very hale Constitution their Breaths are as sweet as the Air
they breathe in and the Woman seems to be of that tender Composition
as if they were designd rather for the Bed than Bondage Yet their Love
is never of that Force and Continuance that any of them ever runs Mad
or makes away with themselves on that score They never love
beyond Retrieving their first Indifferency and when slighted
are as ready to untie the Knot at one end as you are at the other

Yet I knew an European Man that had a Child or two by one of these
Indian Women and afterwards married a Christian after which
he came to pass away a Night with his Indian Mistress
but she made Answer that she then had forgot she ever knew him
and that she never lay with another Womans Husband so fell a crying
and took up the Child she had by him and went out of the Cabin
away from him in great Disorder

Indian Women what they do
The Indian Womens Work is to cook the Victuals for the whole Family
and to make Mats Baskets Girdles of PossumHair and suchlike
They never plant the Corn amongst us as they do amongst the Iroquois
Iroquois great Warriours who are always at War and Hunting
therefore the Plantation Work is left for the Women and Slaves to perform
and look after whilst they are wandring all over the Continent
betwixt the two Bays of Mexico and St Laurence

Mats how made
The Mats the Indian Women make are of Rushes and about five Foot high
and two Fathom long and sewd double that is two together
whereby they become very commodious to lay under our Beds
or to sleep on in the Summer Season in the Daytime and for our Slaves
in the Night

There are other Mats made of Flags which the Tuskeruro Indians make
and sell to the Inhabitants

Baskets
The Baskets our Neighbouring Indians make are all made of a very fine
sort of Bulrushes and sometimes of Silkgrass which they work
with Figures of Beasts Birds Fishes c

A great way up in the Country both Baskets and Mats are made
of the split Reeds which are only the outward shining Part of the Cane
Of these I have seen Mats Baskets and DressingBoxes
very artificially done

Indian Wives
The Savage Women of America have very easy Travail with their Children
sometimes they bring Twins and are brought to bed by themselves
when took at a Disadvantage not but that they have Midwives amongst them
as well as Doctors who make it their Profession for Gain
to assist and deliver Women and some of these Midwives are very knowing
in several Medicines that Carolina affords which certainly expedite
and make easy Births Besides they are unacquainted with those severe Pains
which follow the Birth in our European Women Their Remedies
are a great Cause of this Easiness in that State for the Indian Women
will run up and down the Plantation the same day very briskly
and without any sign of Pain or Sickness yet they look very meager and thin
Not but that we must allow a great deal owing to the Climate
and the natural Constitution of these Women whose Course of Nature
never visits them in such Quantities as the European Women have
And tho they never want Plenty of Milk yet I never saw an Indian Woman
with very large Breasts neither does the youngest Wife ever fail of proving
so good a Nurse as to bring her Child up free from the Rickets and Disasters
that proceed from the Teeth with many other Distempers
which attack our Infants in England and other Parts of Europe
Nurse Children how They let their Children suck till they are well grown
unless they prove big with Child sooner They always nurse
their own Children themselves unless Sickness or Death prevents
I once saw a Nurse hired to give Suck to an Indian Womans Child
which you have in my Journal After Delivery they absent
the Company of a Man for forty days As soon as the Child is born
they wash it in cold Water at the next Stream and then bedawb it
as I have mentiond before Cradle After which the Husband takes care
to provide a Cradle which is soon made consisting of a Piece of flat Wood
which they hew with their Hatchets to the Likeness of a Board it is about
two Foot long and a Foot broad to this they brace and tie the Child down
very close having near the middle a Stick fastend about two Inches
from the Board which is for the Childs Breech to rest on
under which they put a Wad of Moss that receives the Childs Excrements
by which means they can shift the Moss and keep all clean and sweet
Some Nations have very flat Heads as you have heard in my Journal
which is made whilst tied on this Cradle as that Relation informs you
These Cradles are apt to make the Body flat yet they are
the most portable things that can be invented for there is a String
which goes from one Corner of the Board to the other
whereby the Mother flings her Child on her Back so the Infants Back
is towards hers and its Face looks up towards the Sky If it rains
she throws her Leather or Woollen Matchcoat over her Head
which covers the Child all over and secures her and it
from the Injuries of rainy Weather The Savage Women quit all Company
and dress not their own Victuals during their Purgations

After they have had several Children they grow strangely out of Shape
in their Bodies As for Barrenness I never knew any of their Women
that have not Children when marryd

Indian Womens Habit
The Womens Dress is in severe Weather a hairy Matchcoat
in the Nature of a Plad which keeps out the Cold and as I said before
defends their Children from the Prejudices of the Weather At other times
they have only a sort of Flap or Apron containing two Yards in Length
and better than half a Yard deep Sometimes it is a DeerSkin dressd white
and pointed or slit at the bottom like Fringe When this is clean
it becomes them very well Others wear blue or red Flaps
made of Bays and Plains which they buy of the English of both which
they tuck in the Corners to fasten the Garment and sometimes make it fast
with a Belt All of them when ripe have a small String round the Waste
to which another is tied and comes between their Legs where always
is a Wad of Moss against the Os pubis but never any Hair
is there to be found Sometimes they wear Indian Shooes or Moggizons
which are made after the same manner as the Mens are

The Hair of their Heads is made into a long Roll like a Horses Tail
and bound round with Ronoak or Porcelan which is a sort of Beads
they make of the ConkShells Others that have not this
make a LeatherString serve

Indian Mens Habit
The Indian Men have a MatchCoat of Hair Furs Feathers or Cloth
as the Women have Their Hair is rolld up on each Ear as the Womens
only much shorter and oftentimes a Roll on the Crown of the Head or Temples
which is just as they fancy there being no Strictness in their Dress
Betwixt their Legs comes a Piece of Cloth that is tuckd in by a Belt
both before and behind This is to hide their Nakedness
of which Decency they are very strict Observers although never practised
before the Christians came amongst them They wear Shooes
of Bucks and sometimes Bears Skin which they tan in an Hour or two
with the Bark of Trees boild wherein they put the Leather whilst hot
and let it remain a little while whereby it becomes so qualifyd
as to endure Water and Dirt without growing hard These have no Heels
and are made as fit for the Feet as a Glove is for the Hand
and are very easie to travel in when one is a little usd to them
Indians washing in the River When these Savages live near the Water
they frequent the Rivers in Summertime very much where both Men and Women
very often in a day go in naked to wash themselves though not
both Sexes together

MatchCoats how made
Their Feather MatchCoats are very pretty especially some of them
which are made extraordinary charming containing several pretty Figures
wrought in Feathers making them seem like a fine Flower SilkShag
and when new and fresh they become a Bed very well instead of a Quilt
Some of another sort are made of Hare Raccoon Bever or SquirrelSkins
which are very warm Others again are made of the green Part
of the Skin of a Mallards Head which they sew perfectly well together
their Thread being either the Sinews of a Deer divided very small
or SilkGrass When these are finishd they look very finely
though they must needs be very troublesome to make Some of their great Men
as Rulers and such that have Plenty of Deer Skins by them
will often buy the Englishmade Coats which they wear
on Festivals and other Days of Visiting Yet none ever buy any Breeches
saying that they are too much confind in them which prevents their Speed
in running c

We have some Indians that are more civilized than the rest
which wear Hats Shooes Stockings and Breeches with very tolerable
Linnen Shirts which is not common amongst these Heathens
The Paspitank Indians did formerly keep Cattle and make Butter

Civilizd Indians Hatteras Indians
These are them that wear the English Dress Whether they
have Cattle now or no I am not certain but I am of the Opinion
that such Inclinations in the Savages should meet with Encouragement
and every Englishman ought to do them Justice and not defraud them
of their Land which has been allotted them formerly by the Government
for if we do not shew them Examples of Justice and Vertue
we can never bring them to believe us to be a worthier Race of Men
than themselves

The Dresses of these People are so different according to
the Nation that they belong to that it is impossible to recount
all the whimsical Figures that they sometimes make by their Antick Dresses
Besides Carolina is a warm Country and very mild in its Winters
to what Virginia Maryland Pensylvania NewYork the Jerseys
and NewEngland are wherefore our Indians Habit very much differs
from the Dresses that appear amongst the Savages who inhabit
those cold Countries in regard their chiefest Cloathing for the WinterSeason
is made of the Furs of Bever Raccoon and other Northern Furs
that our Climate is not acquainted withal they producing some Furs
as the Monack Moor Marten Black Fox and others to us unknown

Painting for War
Their Dress in Peace and War is quite different Besides
when they go to War their Hair is combd out by the Women
and done over very much with Bears Grease and red Root
with Feathers Wings Rings Copper and Peak or Wampum in their Ears
Moreover they buy Vermillion of the Indian Traders wherewith they paint
their Faces all over red and commonly make a Circle of Black about one Eye
and another Circle of White about the other whilst others bedawb their Faces
with TobaccoPipe Clay Lampblack black Lead and divers other Colours
which they make with the several sorts of Minerals and Earths
that they get in different Parts of the Country where they hunt and travel
When these Creatures are thus painted they make the most frightful Figures
that can be imitated by Men and seem more like Devils than Humane Creatures
You may be sure that they are about some Mischief when you see them
thus painted for in all the Hostilities which have ever been acted
against the English at any time in several of the Plantations of America
the Savages always appeard in this Disguize whereby they might never after
be discoverd or known by any of the Christians that should happen
to see them after they had made their Escape for it is impossible
ever to know an Indian under these Colours although he has been
at your House a thousand times and you know him at other times
as well as you do any Person living As for their Women they never use
any Paint on their Faces neither do they ever carry them along with them
into the Field when they intend any Expedition leaving them at home
with the old Men and Children

Ear Bobs
Some of the Indians wear great Bobs in their Ears and sometimes
in the Holes thereof they put Eagles and other Birds Feathers for a Trophy
When they kill any Fowl they commonly pluck off the downy Feathers
and stick them all over their Heads Some both Men and Women
wear great Necklaces of their Money made of Shells They often wear
Bracelets made of Brass and sometimes of Iron Wire

Indian Money
Their Money is of different sorts but all made of Shells
which are found on the Coast of Carolina which are very large and hard
so that they are very difficult to cut Some English Smiths
have tryd to drill this sort of ShellMoney and thereby thought
to get an Advantage but it provd so hard that nothing could be gaind
They oftentimes make of this Shell a sort of Gorge which they wear
about their Neck in a string so it hangs on their Collar
whereon sometimes is engraven a Cross or some odd sort of Figure
which comes next in their Fancy There are other sorts valued at a DoeSkin
yet the Gorges will sometimes sell for three or four BuckSkins ready drest
There be others that eight of them go readily for a Doe Skin
but the general and current Species of all the Indians in Carolina
and I believe all over the Continent as far as the Bay of Mexico
is that which we call Peak and Ronoak but Peak more especially
This is that which at NewYork they call Wampum and have used it
as current Money amongst the Inhabitants for a great many Years
This is what many Writers call Porcelan and is made at NewYork
in great Quantities and with us in some measure Five Cubits of this
purchase a dressd DoeSkin and seven or eight purchase a dressd BuckSkin
An Englishman could not afford to make so much of this Wampum
for five or ten times the Value for it is made out of a vast great Shell
of which that Country affords Plenty where it is ground smaller
than the small End of a TobaccoPipe or a large WheatStraw
Four or five of these make an Inch and every one is to be drilld through
and made as smooth as Glass and so strung as Beads are
and a Cubit of the Indian Measure contains as much in Length
as will reach from the Elbow to the End of the little Finger
They never stand to question whether it is a tall Man or a short one
that measures it but if this Wampum Peak be black or purple
as some Part of that Shell is then it is twice the Value This the Indians
grind on Stones and other things till they make it current
but the Drilling is the most difficult to the Englishmen
which the Indians manage with a Nail stuck in a Cane or Reed
Thus they roll it continually on their Thighs with their Righthand
holding the Bit of Shell with their Left so in time they drill a Hole
quite through it which is a very tedious Work but especially in making
their Ronoak four of which will scarce make one Length of Wampum
The Indians are a People that never value their time
so that they can afford to make them and never need to fear
the English will take the Trade out of their Hands This is the Money
with which you may buy Skins Furs Slaves or any thing the Indians have
it being the Mammon as our Money is to us that entices and persuades them
to do any thing and part with every thing they possess
except their Children for Slaves As for their Wives they are often sold
and their Daughters violated for it With this they buy off Murders
and whatsoever a Man can do that is ill this Wampum will quit him of
and make him in their Opinion good and vertuous though never
so black before

Indians how named
All the Indians give a Name to their Children which is not the same
as the Father or Mother but what they fancy This Name they keep
if Boys till they arrive to the Age of a Warriour which is
sixteen or seventeen Years then they take a Name to themselves sometimes
Eagle Panther Allegator or some such wild Creature
esteeming nothing on Earth worthy to give them a Name
but these WildFowl and Beasts Some again take the Name of a Fish
which they keep as long as they live

Indian King and Counsellors Every Town a Ruler
yet one over all the Nation
The King is the Ruler of the Nation and has others under him to assist him
as his WarCaptains and Counsellors who are pickd out and chosen
from among the ancientest Men of the Nation he is King of
These meet him in all general Councils and Debates concerning War Peace
Trade Hunting and all the Adventures and Accidents of Humane Affairs
which appear within their Verge where all Affairs are discoursed of
and argued pro and con very deliberately without making
any manner of Parties or Divisions for the Good of the Publick
for as they meet there to treat they discharge their Duty
with all the Integrity imaginable never looking towards their Own Interest
before the Publick Good After every Man has given his Opinion
that which has most Voices or in Summing up is found the most reasonable
that they make use of without any Jars and Wrangling and put it in Execution
the first Opportunity that offers

Succession how
The Succession falls not to the Kings Son but to his Sisters Son
which is a sure way to prevent Impostors in the Succession
Sometimes they poison the Heir to make way for another
which is not seldom done when they do not approve of the Youth
that is to succeed them The King himself is commonly chief Doctor
in that Cure

They are so well versed in Poison that they are often found to poison
whole Families nay most of a Town and which is most to be admired
they will poison a running Spring or Fountain of Water
so that whosoever drinks thereof shall infallible die
When the Offender is discoverd his very Relations urge for Death
whom nothing will appease but the most cruel Torment imaginable
which is executed in the most publick Manner that its possible
to act such a Tragedy in For all the whole Nation and all the Indians
within a hundred Mile if it is possible to send for them are summond
to come and appear at such a Place and Time to see and rejoyce at
the Torments and Death of such a Person who is the common and professd Enemy
to all the friendly Indians thereabouts who now lies under
the Condemnation of the whole Nation and accordingly is to be put to Death
Then all appear young and old from all the adjacent Parts
and meet with all the Expressions of Joy to consummate
this horrid and barbarous Feast which is carried on after this dismal Manner
Poisoning Indians how punished First they bring the Prisoner
to the Place appointed for the Execution where he is set down on his Breech
on the Ground Then they all get about him and you shall not see
one sorrowful or dejected Countenance amongst them but all
very merrily disposd as if some Comedy was to be acted
instead of a Tragedy He that is appointed to be the chief Executioner
takes a Knife and bids him hold out his Hands which he does
and then cuts round the Wrist through the Skin which is drawn off
like a Glove and flead quite off at the Fingers Ends then they break
his Joints and Bones and buffet and torment him after a very inhumane Manner
till some violent Blow perhaps ends his Days then they burn him to Ashes
and throw them down the River Afterwards they eat drink and are merry
repeating all the Actions of the Tormentors and the Prisoner
with a great deal of Mirth and Satisfaction This Accusation is laid
against an Indian Heroe sometimes wrongfully or when they have a mind
to get rid of a Man that has more Courage and Conduct than his neighbouring
Kings or great Men then they alledge the Practice of poisoning Indians
against him and make a Rehearsal of every Indian that died
for a year or two and say that they were poisond by such an Indian
which Reports stir up all the Relations of the deceased
against the said Person and by such means make him away presently
In some Affairs these Savages are very reservd and politick
and will attend a long time with a great deal of Patience
to bring about their Designs they being never impatient or hasty
in executing any of their Designs of Revenge

Now I am gone so far in giving an Account of the Indians Temper
I will proceed and can give you no other Character of them
but that they are a very wary People and are never hasty or impatient
They will endure a great many Misfortunes Losses and Disapointments
without shewing themselves in the least vexd or uneasy
When they go by Water if there proves a HeadWind they never vex and fret
as the Europeans do and let what Misfortune come to them
as will or can happen they never relent Besides there is one Vice
very common every where which I never found amongst them
which is Envying other Mens Happiness because their Station is not equal to
or above their Neighbours Of this Sin I cannot say I ever saw an Example
though they are a People that set as great a Value upon themselves
as any sort of Men in the World upon which Account they find something
Valuable in themselves above Riches Thus he that is a good Warriour
is the proudest Creature living and he that is an expert Hunter is esteemd
by the People and himself yet all these are natural Vertues and Gifts
and not Riches which are as often in the Possession of a Fool as a Wiseman
Several of the Indians are possessd of a great many Skins Wampum
Ammunition and what other things are esteemd Riches amongst them
yet such an Indian is no more esteemd amongst them than any other
ordinary Fellow provided he has no personal Endowments which are
the Ornaments that must gain him an Esteem among them for a great Dealer
amongst the Indians is no otherwise respected and esteemed
than as a Man that strains his Wits and fatigues himself to furnish others
with Necessaries of Life that live much easier and enjoy more of the World
than he himself does with all his Pelf Indians not afraid to die
If they are taken Captives and expect a miserable Exit they sing
if Death approach them in Sickness they are not afraid of it
nor are ever heard to say Grant me some time They know by Instinct
and daily Example that they must die wherefore they have
that great and noble Gift to submit to every thing that happens
and value nothing that attacks them

Their Cruelty to their Prisoners of War is what they are seemingly
guilty of an Error in I mean as to a natural Failing because they strive
to invent the most inhumane Butcheries for them that the Devils themselves
could invent or hammer out of Hell they esteeming Death no Punishment
but rather an Advantage to him that is exported out of this
into another World

Indians Cruelty to Prisoners of War
Therefore they inflict on them Torments wherein they prolong Life
in that miserable state as long as they can and never miss Skulping of them
as they call it which is to cut off the Skin from the Temples
and taking the whole Head of Hair along with it as if it was a Nightcap
Sometimes they take the Top of the Skull along with it all which
they preserve and carefully keep by them for a Trophy of their Conquest
over their Enemies Others keep their Enemies Teeth which are taken in War
whilst others split the PitchPine into Splinters and stick them
into the Prisoners Body yet alive Thus they light them which burn like
so many Torches and in this manner they make him dance round a great Fire
every one buffeting and deriding him till he expires when every one
strives to get a Bone or some Relick of this unfortunate Captive
One of the young Fellows that has been at the Wars and has had the Fortune
to take a Captive returns the proudest Creature on Earth
and sets such a Value on himself that he knows not how to contain himself
in his Senses The Iroquois or Sinnagers are the most Warlike Indians
that we know of being always at War and not to be persuaded
from that Way of Living by any Argument that can be used
If you go to persuade them to live peaceably with the Tuskeruros
and let them be one People and in case those Indians desire it
and will submit to them they will answer you that they cannot live
without War which they have ever been used to and that if Peace be made
with the Indians they now war withal they must find out some others
to wage War against for for them to live in Peace is to live
out of their Element War Conquest and Murder being what they delight in
and value themselves for Indians flea and cut off part of the Feet
When they take a Slave and intend to keep him to Work in their Fields
they flea the Skin from the Setting on of his Toes to the middle of his Foot
so cut off one half of his Feet wrapping the Skin over the Wounds
and healing them By this cruel Method the Indian Captive is hinderd
from making his Escape for he can neither run fast or go any where
but his Feet are more easily traced and discoverd Yet I know one Man
who made his Escape from them tho they had thus disabled him
as you may see in my Journal

The Indians ground their Wars on Enmity not on Interest as the Europeans
generally do for the Loss of the meanest Person in the Nation
they will go to War and lay all at Stake and prosecute their Design
to the utmost till the Nation they were injurd by be wholly destroyd
or make them that Satisfaction which they demand They are very politick
in waging and carrying on their War first by advising with
all the ancient Men of Conduct and Reason that belong to their Nation
such as superannuated WarCaptains and those that have been Counsellors
for many Years and whose Advice has commonly succeeded very well
They have likewise their Field Counsellors who are accustomed to Ambuscades
and Surprizes which Methods are commonly used by the Savages
for I scarce ever heard of a FieldBattle fought amongst them

One of their Expeditions afforded an Instance worthy mention
which was thus Two Nations of Indians here in Carolina
were at War together and a Party of each were in the Forest
ranging to see what Enemies they could take The lesser Number
found they were discoverd and could not well get over a River
that lay betwixt them and their home without engaging the other Party
whose Numbers were much the greater so they calld a Council
which met and having weighd their present Circumstances
with a great deal of Argument and Debate for a considerable time
and found their Enemies Advantage and that they could expect no Success
in Engaging such an unequal Number they at last concluded on
this Stratagem which in my Opinion carried a great deal of Policy
along with it Indian Politicks It was That the same Night
they should make a great Fire which they were certain would be discoverd
by the adverse Party and there dress up Logs of Wood in their Cloaths
and make them exactly seem like Indians that were asleep by the Fireside
which is their Way when in the Woods so said they our Enemies will fire
upon these Images supposing them to be us who will lie in Ambuscade
and after their Guns are unloaded shall deal well enough with them
This Result was immediately put in Execution and the Fire was made
by the side of a Valley where they lay perdu very advantageously
Thus a little before Break of Day which commonly is the Hour
they surprize their Enemies in the Indians came down to their Fire
and at once fired in upon those Logs in the Indians Cloaths
and run up to them expecting they had killd every Man dead
but they found themselves mistaken for then the other Indians
who had lain all the Night starknaked in the Bottom attackd them
with their loaded Pieces which so surprized them that every Man
was taken Prisoner and brought in bound to their Town

Another Instance was betwixt the Machapunga Indians and the Coranines
on the SandBanks which was as follows Machapunga King Charles
The Machapungas were invited to a Feast by the Coranines
which two Nations had been a long time at War together
and had lately concluded a Peace Thereupon the Machapunga Indians
took the Advantage of coming to the Coranines Feast which was
to avoid all Suspicion and their King who of a Savage
is a great Politician and very stout orderd all his Men
to carry their Tamahauks along with them hidden under their MatchCoats
which they did and being acquainted when to fall on by the Word given
they all upon this Design set forward for the Feast and came to
the Coranine Town where they had gotten Victuals Fruit
and such things as make an Indian Entertainment all ready
to make these new Friends welcome which they did and after Dinner
towards the Evening as it is customary amongst them they went to Dancing
all together so when the Machapunga King saw the best Opportunity offer
he gave the Word and his Men pulld their Tamahauks or Hatchets
from under their MatchCoats and killd several and took the rest Prisoners
except some few that were not present and about four or five that escapd
The Prisoners they sold Slaves to the English At the time this was done
those Indians had nothing but Bows and Arrows neither side having Guns

The Indians are very revengeful and never forget an Injury done
till they have receivd Satisfaction Yet they are the freest People
from Heats and Passions which possess the Europeans of any
I ever heard of Drunkenness in Indians They never call any Man
to account for what he did when he was drunk but say it was the Drink
that caused his Misbehaviour therefore he ought to be forgiven
They never frequent a Christians House that is given to Passion
nor will they ever buy or sell with him if they can get
the same Commodities of any other Person for they say
such Men are mad Wolves and no more Men

Indians not Jealous
They know not what Jealousy is because they never think
their Wives are unconstant unless they are Eyewitnesses thereof
They are generally very bashful especially the young Maids
who when they come into a strange Cabin where they are not acquainted
never ask for any thing though never so hungry or thirsty
but sit down without speaking a Word be it never so long
till some of the House asks them a Question or falls into Discourse
with the Stranger I never saw a Scold amongst them and to their Children
they are extraordinary tender and indulgent neither did I ever see
a Parent correct a Child excepting one Woman that was the Kings Wife
and she indeed did possess a Temper that is not commonly found amongst them
Indians Complements They are free from all manner of Compliments
except Shaking of Hands and Scratching on the Shoulder
which two are the greatest Marks of Sincerity and Friendship
that can be shewd one to another They cannot express fare you well
but when they leave the House will say I go straightway
which is to intimate their Departure and if the Man of the House
has any Message to send by the going Man he may acquaint him therewith
Their Tongue allows not to say Sir I am your Servant
because they have no different Titles for Man only King WarCaptain
Old Man or Young Man which respect the Stations and Circumstances
Men are employd in and arrivd to and not Ceremony As for Servant
they have no such thing except Slave and their Dogs Cats
tame or domestick Beasts and Birds are calld by the same Name
For the Indian Word for Slave includes them all So when an Indian
tells you he has got a Slave for you it may in general Terms as they use
be a young Eagle a Dog Otter or any other thing of that Nature
which is obsequiously to depend on the Master for its Sustenance

Indians not afraid of Spirits
They are never fearful in the Night nor do the Thoughts of Spirits
ever trouble them such as the many Hobgoblins and Bugbears that we suck in
with our Milk and the Foolery of our Nurses and Servants suggest to us
who by their idle Tales of Fairies and Witches make such Impressions
on our tender Years that at Maturity we carry Pigmies Souls
in Giants Bodies and ever after are thereby so much deprivd of Reason
and unmand as never to be Masters of half the Bravery
Nature designd for us

Not but that the Indians have as many Lying Stories
of Spirits and Conjurers as any People in the World but they tell it
with no Disadvantage to themselves for the great Esteem
which the Old Men bring themselves to is by making the others believe
their Familiarity with Devils and Spirits and how great a Correspondence
they have therewith which if it once gains Credit they ever after are held
in the greatest Veneration imaginable and whatever they after impose
upon the People is receivd as infallible They are so little startled
at the Thoughts of another World that they not seldom murder themselves
as for Instance a BearRiver Indian a very likely young Fellow
about twenty Years of Age whose Mother was angry at his drinking
of too much Rum and chid him for it thereupon replyd
he would have her satisfied and he would do the like no more
upon which he made his Words good for he went aside and shot himself dead
This was a Son of the politick King of the Machapunga I spoke of before
and has the most Cunning of any Indian I ever met withal

Most of the Savages are much addicted to Drunkenness a Vice
they never were acquainted with till the Christians came amongst them
Some of them refrain drinking strong Liquors but very few of that sort
are found amongst them Their chief Liquor is Rum without any Mixture
This the English bring amongst them and buy Skins Furs
Slaves and other of their Commodities therewith They never are contented
with a little but when once begun they must make themselves quite drunk
otherwise they will never rest but sell all they have in the World
rather than not have their full Dose In these drunken Frolicks
which are always carried on in the Night they sometimes murder one another
fall into the Fire fall down Precipices and break their Necks
with several other Misfortunes which this drinking of Rum brings upon them
and tho they are sensible of it yet they have no Power
to refrain this Enemy About five years ago when Landgrave Daniel
was Governour he summond in all the Indian Kings and Rulers to meet
and in a full Meeting of the Government and Council with those Indians
they agreed upon a firm Peace and the Indian Rulers desired
no Rum might be sold to them which was granted and a Law made
that inflicted a Penalty on those that sold Rum to the Heathens
but it was never strictly observd and besides the young Indians
were so disgusted at that Article that they threatned to kill the Indians
that made it unless it was laid aside and they might have Rum sold them
when they went to the Englishmens Houses to buy it

Some of the Heathens are so very poor that they have no Manner of Cloaths
save a Wad of Moss to hide their Nakedness These are either lusty
and will not work otherwise they are given to Gaming or Drunkenness
yet these get Victuals as well as the rest because that is common
amongst them If they are caught in theft they are Slaves till they repay
the Person as I mentiond before but to steal from the English
they reckon no Harm Not but that I have known some few Savages
that have been as free from Theft as any of the Christians
When they have a Design to lie with a Woman which they cannot obtain
any otherwise than by a larger Reward than they are able to give
they then strive to make her drunk which a great many of them will be
then they take the Advantage to do with them what they please
and sometimes in their Drunkenness cut off their Hair and sell it
to the English which is the greatest Affront can be offerd them
They never value Time for if they be going out to hunt fish
or any other indifferent Business you may keep them in talk
as long as you please so you but keep them in Discourse and seem pleased
with their Company yet none are more expeditious and safer Messengers
than they when any extraordinary Business that they are sent about
requires it

Not pass over a Tree
When they are upon travelling the Woods they keep a constant Pace
neither will they stride over a Tree that lies cross the Path but always
go round it which is quite contrary to the Custom of the English
and other Europeans Cut with a Knife how A Knife of Reed
When they cut with a Knife the Edge is towards them whereas we
always cut and whittle from us Not lefthanded Nor did I ever see
one of them lefthanded Get Fire how Before the Christians
came amongst them not knowing the Use of Steel and Flints
they got their Fire with Sticks which by vehement Collision
or Rubbing together take Fire This Method they will sometimes practise now
when it has happend thro rainy Weather or some other Accident
that they have wet their Spunk which is a sort of soft corky Substance
generally of a Cinnamon Colour and grows in the concave part of an Oak
Hiccory and several other Woods being dug out with an Ax
and always kept by the Indians instead of Tinder or Touchwood
both which it exceeds You are to understand that the two Sticks
they use to strike Fire withal are never of one sort of Wood
but always differ from each other

They are expert Travellers and though they have not the Use
of our artificial Compass yet they understand the Northpoint exactly
let them be in never so great a Wilderness One Guide is a short Moss
that grows upon some Trees exactly on the NorthSide thereof

Indian Compass
Besides they have Names for eight of the thirty two Points
and call the Winds by their several Names as we do but indeed more properly
for the NorthWest Wind is called the cold Wind the NorthEast the wet Wind
the South the warm Wind and so agreeably of the rest Sometimes it happens
that they have a large River or Lake to pass over and the Weather
is very foggy as it often happens in the Spring and Fall of the Leaf
so that they cannot see which Course to steer In such a Case
they being on one side of the River or Lake they know well enough
what Course such a Place which they intend for bears from them
Therefore they get a great many Sticks and Chunks of Wood in their Canoe
and then set off directly for their Port and now and then throw over
a Piece of Wood which directs them by seeing how the Stick bears
from the Canoes Stern which they always observe to keep right aft
and this is the Indian Compass by which they will go over
a broad Water of ten or twenty Leagues wide They will find
the Head of any River though it is five six or seven hundred miles off
and they never were there in their Lives before as is often provd
by their appointing to meet on the Head of such a River where perhaps
none of them ever was before but where they shall rendezvous exactly
at the prefixt time and if they meet with any Obstruction
they leave certain Marks in the Way where they that come after
will understand how many have passd by already and which way they are gone
Besides in their War Expeditions they have very certain Hieroglyphicks
whereby each Party informs the other of the Success or Losses
they have met withal all which is so exactly performd
by their Sylvian Marks and Characters that they are never at a Loss
to understand one another Yet there was never found any Letters
amongst the Savages of Carolina nor I believe among any other Natives
in America that were possessd with any manner of Writing or Learning
throughout all the Discoveries of the NewWorld Indians make Maps
They will draw Maps very exactly of all the Rivers Towns Mountains
and Roads or what you shall enquire of them which you may draw
by their Directions and come to a small matter of Latitude
reckoning by their Days Journeys These Maps they will draw
in the Ashes of the Fire and sometimes upon a Mat or Piece of Bark
I have put a Pen and Ink into a Savages Hand and he has drawn me
the Rivers Bays and other Parts of a Country which afterwards
I have found to agree with a great deal of Nicety But you must be very much
in their Favour otherwise they will never make these Discoveries to you
especially if it be in their own Quarters No Discovery of Mines
And as for Mines of Silver and other Metals we are satisfied we have enow
and those very rich in Carolina and its adjacent Parts some of which
the Indians are acquainted withal although no Enquirers thereafter
but what came and were discoverd by Chance yet they say it is this Metal
that the English covet as they do their Peak and Ronoak
and that we have gaind Ground of them wherever we have come
Now say they if we should discover these Minerals to the English
they would settle at or near these Mountains and bereave us
of the best HuntingQuarters we have as they have already done
wherever they have inhabited so by that means we shall be driven
to some unknown Country to live hunt and get our Bread in
These are the Reasons that the Savages give for not making known
what they are acquainted withal of that Nature And indeed
all Men that have ever gone upon those Discoveries allow them to be good
Mr Mitchell more especially my ingenious Friend
Mr FrancisLouis Mitchell of Bern in Switzerland who has been
for several Years very indefatigable and strict in his Discoveries
amongst those vast Ledges of Mountains and spacious Tracts of Land
lying towards the Heads of the great Bays and Rivers of Virginia Maryland
and Pensylvania where he has discoverd a spacious Country
inhabited by none but the Savages and not many of them
who yet are of a very friendly Nature to the Christians This Gentleman
has been employd by the Canton of Bern to find out a Tract of Land
in the English America where that Republick might settle
some of their People which Proposal I believe is now in a fair way
towards a Conclusion between her Majesty of GreatBritain and that Canton
Switzers Settlement in America Which must needs be of great Advantage
to both and as for ourselves I believe no Man that is in his Wits
and understands the Situation and Affairs of America
but will allow nothing can be of more Security and Advantage
to the Crown and Subjects of GreatBritain than to have our Frontiers
secured by a warlike People and our Friends as the Switzers are
especially when we have more Indians than we can civilize
and so many Christian Enemies lying on the back of us that we do not know
how long or short a time it may be before they visit us Add to these
the Effects and Product that may be expected from those Mountains
which may hereafter prove of great Advantage to the British Monarchy
and none more fit than an industrious People bred in a mountainous Country
and inurd to all the Fatigues of War and Travel to improve a Country
Thus we have no room to doubt but as soon as any of those Parts
are seated by the Switzers a great many Britains will strive
to live amongst them for the Benefit of the sweet Air and healthful Climate
which that Country affords were it only for the Cultivating of Hemp
Flax Wine and other valuable Staples which those People
are fully acquainted withal Not to mention the Advantages
already discoverd by that worthy Gentleman I just now spoke of
who is highly deserving of the Conduct and Management of such an Affair
as that wise Canton has entrusted him withal

Hunting of the Savages
When these Savages go a hunting they commonly go out in great Numbers
and oftentimes a great many Days Journey from home beginning at
the coming in of the Winter that is when the Leaves are fallen
from the Trees and are become dry Tis then they burn the Woods
by setting Fire to the Leaves and witherd Bent and Grass
Moss Match which they do with a Match made of the black Moss
that hangs on the Trees in Carolina and is sometimes above six Foot long
This when dead becomes black tho of an AshColour before
and will then hold Fire as well as the best Match we have in Europe
In Places where this Moss is not found as towards the Mountains
they make Lintels of the Bark of Cypress beaten which serve as well
Thus they go and fire the Woods for many Miles and drive
the Deer and other Game into small Necks of Land and Isthmuss
where they kill and destroy what they please In these HuntingQuarters
they have their Wives and Ladies of the Camp where they eat
all the Fruits and Dainties of that Country and live in all
the Mirth and Jollity which it is possible for such People
to entertain themselves withal Here it is that they get
their Complement of DeerSkins and Furs to trade with the English
the DeerSkins being in Season in Winter which is contrary to England
All small Game as Turkeys Ducks and small Vermine they commonly kill
with Bow and Arrow thinking it not worth throwing Powder and Shot after them
Of Turkeys they have abundance especially in OakLand
as most of it is that lies any distance backwards I have been often
in their HuntingQuarters where a roasted or barbakued Turkey
eaten with Bears Fat is held a good Dish and indeed I approve of it
very well for the Bears Grease is the sweetest and least offensive
to the Stomach as I said before of any Fat of Animals I ever tasted
Beating of Corn The Savage Men never beat their Corn to make Bread
but that is the Womens Work especially the Girls of whom you shall see
four beating with long great Pestils in a narrow wooden Mortar
and every one keeps her Stroke so exactly that tis worthy of Admiration
Their Cookery continues from Morning till Night The Hunting
makes them hungry and the Indians are a People that always
eat very often not seldom getting up at Midnight to eat
They plant a great many sorts of Pulse Part of which they eat green
in the Summer keeping great Quantities for their WinterStore
which they carry along with them into the HuntingQuarters and eat them

The small red Pease is very common with them and they eat
a great deal of that and other sorts boild with their Meat
or eaten with Bears Fat which Food makes them break Wind backwards
which the Men frequently do and laugh heartily at it it being accounted
no ill Manners amongst the Indians Yet the Women are more modest
than to follow that ill Custom At their setting out they have Indians
to attend their HuntingCamp that are not good and expert Hunters
Servile Indians therefore are employd to carry Burdens
to get Bark for the Cabins and other Servile Work also to go
backward and forward to their Towns to carry News to the old People
whom they leave behind them The Women are forced to carry
their Loads of Grain and other Provisions and get FireWood
for a good Hunter or Warriour in these Expeditions is employd
in no other Business than the Affairs of Game and Battle
Dryd Fruits The wild Fruits which are dryd in the Summer over Fires
on Hurdles and in the Sun are now brought into the Field as are likewise
the Cakes and Quiddonies of Peaches and that Fruit and Bilberries dryd
of which they stew and make FruitBread and Cakes Pigeons Fat
In some parts where Pigeons are plentiful they get of their Fat
enough to supply their Winter Stores Thus they abide in these Quarters
all the Winter long till the Time approach for planting
their Maiz and other Fruits Bowls and TobaccoPipes to make Dress Skins
In these quarters at Sparehours the Women make Baskets and Mats
to lie upon and those that are not extraordinary Hunters
make Bowls Dishes and Spoons of Gumwood and the TulipTree
others where they find a Vein of white Clay fit for their purpose
make Tobaccopipes all which are often transported to other Indians
that perhaps have greater Plenty of Deer and other Game
so they buy with these Manufactures their raw Skins with the Hair on
which our neighbouring Indians bring to their Towns
and in the Summertime make the Slaves and sorry Hunters dress them
the WinterSun being not strong enough to dry them and those
that are dryd in the Cabins are black and nasty with the Lightwood Smoke
which they commonly burn Their Way of dressing their Skins
is by soaking them in Water so they get the Hair off with an Instrument
made of the Bone of a Deers Foot yet some use a sort of Iron DrawingKnife
which they purchase of the English and after the Hair is off
they dissolve Deers Brains which beforehand are made in a Cake
and baked in the Embers in a Bowl of Water so soak the Skins therein
till the Brains have suckd up the Water then they dry it gently
and keep working it with an OysterShell or some such thing
to scrape withal till it is dry whereby it becomes soft and pliable
Yet these so dressd will not endure wet but become hard thereby
which to prevent they either cure them in the Smoke
or tan them with Bark as before observd not but that young Indian Corn
beaten to a Pulp will effect the same as the Brains They are not only
good Hunters of the wild Beasts and Game of the Forest but very expert
in taking the Fish of the Rivers and Waters near which they inhabit
and are acquainted withal Fish to strike Thus they that live
a great way up the Rivers practise Striking Sturgeon and Rockfish or Bass
when they come up the Rivers to spawn besides the vast Shoals of Sturgeon
which they kill and take with Snares as we do Pike in Europe The Herrings
in March and April run a great way up the Rivers and fresh Streams
to spawn where the Savages make great Wares with Hedges
that hinder their Passage only in the Middle where an artificial Pound
is made to take them in so that they cannot return This Method is in use
all over the fresh Streams to catch Trout and the other Species of Fish
which those Parts afford Crawfish to take Their taking of Crawfish
is so pleasant that I cannot pass it by without mention
When they have a mind to get these Shellfish they take a Piece of Venison
and halfbarbakue or roast it then they cut it into thin Slices
which Slices they stick through with Reeds about six Inches asunder
betwixt Piece and Piece then the Reeds are made sharp at one end
and so they stick a great many of them down in the bottom of the Water
thus baited in the small Brooks and Runs which the Crawfish frequent
Thus the Indians sit by and tend those baited Sticks
every now and then taking them up to see how many are at the Bait
where they generally find abundance so take them off
and put them in a Basket for the purpose and stick the Reeds down again
By this Method they will in a little time catch several Bushels
which are as good as any I ever eat Hatteras Indians
Those Indians that frequent the SaltWaters take abundance of Fish
some very large and of several sorts which to preserve
they first barbakue then pull the Fish to Pieces so dry it in the Sun
whereby it keeps for Transportation as for Scate Oysters Cockles
and several sorts of Shellfish they open and dry them upon Hurdles
having a constant Fire under them The Hurdles are made of Reeds or Canes
in the shape of a Gridiron Thus they dry several Bushels of these Fish
and keep them for their Necessities At the time when they are on the Salts
and Sea Coasts they have another Fishery that is for a little Shellfish
Blackmoor Teeth which those in England call Blackmoors Teeth
These they catch by tying Bits of Oysters to a long String
which they lay in such places as they know those ShellFish haunt
These Fish get hold of the Oysters and suck them in so that they pull up
those long Strings and take great Quantities of them which they carry
a great way into the main Land to trade with the remote Indians
where they are of great Value but never near the Sea by reason
they are common therefore not esteemd Besides the Youth and Indian Boys
go in the Night and one holding a Lightwood Torch the other has
a Bow and Arrows and the Fire directing him to see the Fish he shoots them
with the Arrows and thus they kill a great many of the smaller Fry
and sometimes pretty large ones Indians not eat of the first he kills
It is an establishd Custom amongst all these Natives
that the young Hunter never eats of that Buck Bear Fish or any other Game
which happens to be the first they kill of that sort because they believe
if he should eat thereof he would never after be fortunate in Hunting
Big bellied Woman never eat of the first Fish caught in a Ware
The like foolish Ceremony they hold when they have made a Ware
to take Fish withal if a bigbellyd Woman eat of the first Dish
that is caught in it they say that Ware will never take much Fish
Indians not kill Snakes why and as for killing of Snakes
they avoid it if they lie in their way because their Opinion is
that some of the Serpents Kindred would kill some of the Savages Relations
that should destroy him They have thousands of these foolish
Ceremonies and Beliefs which they are strict Observers of
Moreover several Customs are found in some Families which others keep not
Circumcision as for Example two Families of the Machapunga Indians
use the Jewish Custom of Circumcision and the rest do not
neither did I ever know any others amongst the Indians
that practisd any such thing and perhaps if you ask them
what is the Reason they do so they will make you no Manner of Answer
which is as much as to say I will not tell you Many other Customs
they have for which they will render no Reason or Account
and to pretend to give a true Description of their Religion it is impossible
for there are a great many of their Absurdities which for some Reason
they reserve as a Secret amongst themselves or otherwise
they are jealous of their Weakness in the practising them
so that they never acquaint any Christian with the Knowledge thereof
let Writers pretend what they will Indian Idols give an account of
for I have known them amongst their Idols and dead Kings
in their Quiogozon for several Days where I could never get Admittance
to see what they were doing though I was at great Friendship
with the King and great Men but all my Persuasions availd me nothing
Neither were any but the King with the Conjurer and some few old Men
in that House as for the young Men and chiefest Numbers of the Indians
they were kept as ignorant of what the Elders were doing as myself

The World is round
They all believe that this World is round and that there are two Spirits
the one good the other bad What they believe of God
Their offering Idols The good one they reckon to be
the Author and Maker of every thing and say that it is he
that gives them the Fruits of the Earth and has taught them to hunt fish
and be wise enough to overpower the Beasts of the Wilderness
and all other Creatures that they may be assistant and beneficial to Man
to which they add that the Quera or good Spirit has been very kind
to the English Men to teach them to make Guns and Ammunition
besides a great many other Necessaries that are helpful to Man
all which they say will be deliverd to them when that good Spirit
sees fit They do not believe that God punishes any Man
either in this Life or that to come but that he delights in doing good
and in giving the Fruits of the Earth and instructing us in making
several useful and ornamental things Devil what They say
it is a bad Spirit who lives separate from the good one
that torments us with Sicknesses Disappointments Losses Hunger Travel
and all the Misfortunes that Humane Life is incident to
How they are treated in the next World I have already mentiond
and as I said before they are very resolute in dying
when in the Hands of Savage Enemies yet I saw one of their young Men
a very likely Person condemnd on a Sunday for Killing a Negro
and burning the House Indian condemnd I took good Notice
of his Behaviour when he was brought out of the House to die
which was the next Morning after Sentence but he changd his Countenance
with Trembling and was in the greatest Fear and Agony I never saw
any Person under his Circumstances which perhaps might be occasiond
by his being deliverd up by his own Nation which was the Tuskeruros
and executed by us that are not their common Enemies though he met
with more Favour than he would have receivd at the Hands of Savages
for he was only hangd on a Tree near the Place where the Murder
was committed and the three Kings that but the day before
shewd such a Reluctancy to deliver him up but would have given another
in his Room when he was hangd pulld him by the Hand and said
Thou wilt never play any more Rogues Tricks in this World
whither art thou gone to shew thy Tricks now Which shews these Savages
to be what they really are viz a People that will save their own Men
if they can but if the Safety of all the People lies at Stake they will
deliver up the most innocent Person living and be so far from Concern
when they have made themselves easy thereby that they will laugh
at their Misfortunes and never pity or think of them more

Indian Conjurers
Their Priests are the Conjurers and Doctors of the Nation
I shall mention some of their Methods and Practices and so leave them
to the Judgment of the Reader As I told you before the Priests make
their Orations at every Feast or other great Meeting of the Indians
Indian Lightning at Chattooka at a Feast for rebuilding
a Kings House burnt I happend to be at one of these great Meetings
which was at the Funeral of a Tuskeruro Indian that was slain
with Lightning at a Feast the day before where I was amongst the rest
it was in July and a very fair day where in the Afternoon
about six or seven a Clock as they were dealing out their Victuals
there appeard a little black Cloud to the North West
which spread and brought with it Rain Wind and Lightning
so we went out from the Place where we were all at Victuals
and went down to the Cabins where I left the Indians and went to lie
in my Canoe which was convenient enough to keep me dry
The Lightning came so terrible and down in long Streams
that I was afraid it would have taken hold of a Barrel of Powder
I had in my Vessel and so blown me up but it pleasd God
that it did me no Harm yet the Violence of the Wind had blown
all the Water away where I rid at Anchor so that my Canoe lay dry
and some Indian Women came with Torches in their Hands
to the side of the Canoe and told me an Indian was killd with Lightning
The next day I think he was buried and I stayd to see the Ceremony
and was very tractable to help the Indians to trim their Reeds
and make the Coffin which pleased them very much because I had a mind
to see the Interment Before he was Interrd according to their Custom
they dealt every one some hot Victuals which he took and did
what he would with Then the Doctor began to talk and told the People
what Lightning was and that it killd every thing that dwelt upon the Earth
nay the very Fishes did not escape for it often reachd
the Porpoises and other Fish and destroyd them that every thing
strove to shun it except the Mice who he said were the busiest
in eating their Corn in the Fields when it lightned the most
He added that no Wood or Tree could withstand it except the black Gum
and that it would run round that Tree a great many times to enter therein
but could not effect it Now you must understand that sort of Gum will not
split or rive therefore I suppose the Story might arise from thence
At last he began to tell the most ridiculous absurd Parcel of Lyes
about Lightning that could be as that an Indian of that Nation
had once got Lightning in the Likeness of a Partridge
That no other Lightning could harm him whilst he had that about him
and that after he had kept it for several Years it got away from him
so that he then became as liable to be struck with Lightning
as any other Person There was present at the same time
an Indian that had livd from his Youth chiefly in an English House
so I calld to him and told him what a Parcel of Lyes the Conjurer told
not doubting but he thought so as well as I but I found to the contrary
for he replyd that I was much mistaken for that old Man
who I believe was upwards of an hundred Years old did never tell Lyes
and as for what he said it was very true for he knew it himself to be so
How hard it is to bring the Indians from their Superstition
Thereupon seeing the Fellows Ignorance I talkd no more about it
RattleSnake kill Indians in Canoes Eagles kill it
Then the Doctor proceeded to tell a long Tale of a great RattleSnake
which a great while ago livd by a Creek in that River
which was Neus and that it killd abundance of Indians
but at last a bald Eagle killd it and they were rid of a Serpent
that usd to devour whole Canoes full of Indians at a time
I have been something tedious upon this Subject on purpose to shew
what strange ridiculous Stories these Wretches are inclinable to believe
I suppose these Doctors understand a little better themselves
than to give Credit to any such Fooleries for I reckon them
the cunningest Knaves in all the Pack I will therefore begin with
their Physick and Surgery which is next Indian Physick and Surgery
You must know that the Doctors or Conjurers to gain a greater Credit
amongst these People tell them that all Distempers are
the Effects of evil Spirits or the bad Spirit which has struck them
with this or that Malady therefore none of these Physicians
undertakes any Distemper but that he comes to an Exorcism
to effect the Cure and acquaints the sick Partys Friends
that he must converse with the good Spirit to know whether the Patient
will recover or not if so then he will drive out the bad Spirit
and the Patient will become well Now the general way of their Behaviour
in curing the Sick a great deal of which I have seen
and shall give some Account thereof in as brief a manner as possible is
when an Indian is sick if they think there is much Danger of Life
and that he is a great Man or hath good Friends the Doctor is sent for
As soon as the Doctor comes into the Cabin the sick Person is sat
on a Mat or Skin starknaked lying on his Back and all uncoverd
except some small Trifle that covers their Nakedness when ripe
otherwise in very young Children there is nothing about them
Conjuring over the Sick In this manner the Patient lies
when the Conjurer appears and the King of that Nation comes to attend him
with a Rattle made of a Gourd with Pease in it This the King delivers
into the Doctors Hand whilst another brings a Bowl of Water
and sets it down Then the Doctor begins and utters some few Words
very softly afterwards he smells of the Patients Navel and Belly
and sometimes scarifies him a little with a Flint or an Instrument
made of RattleSnakes Teeth for that purpose then he sucks the Patient
and gets out a Mouthful of Blood and Serum but Serum chiefly
which perhaps may be a better Method in many Cases than to take away
great Quantities of Blood as is commonly practisd which he spits
in the Bowl of Water Then he begins to mutter and talk apace
and at last to cut Capers and clap his Hands on his Breech and Sides
till he gets into a Sweat so that a Stranger would think he was running mad
now and then sucking the Patient and so at times keeps sucking
till he has got a great Quantity of very illcoloured Matter out of the Belly
Arms Breast Forehead Temples Neck and most Parts still continuing
his Grimaces and antick Postures which are not to be matchd in Bedlam
At last you will see the Doctor all over of a dropping Sweat
and scarce able to utter one Word having quite spent himself
then he will cease for a while and so begin again till he comes
in the same Pitch of Raving and seeming Madness as before
all this time the sick Body never so much as moves although doubtless
the Lancing and Sucking must be a great Punishment to them
but they certainly are the patientest and most steady People
under any Burden that I ever saw in my Life Whether live or die
At last the Conjurer makes an end and tells the Patients Friends
whether the Person will live or die Bury the Serum
and then one that waits at this Ceremony takes the Blood away
which remains in a Lump in the middle of the Water and buries it
in the Ground in a Place unknown to any one but he that inters it
Now I believe a great deal of Imposture in these Fellows
yet I never knew their Judgment fail though I have seen them
give their Opinion after this Manner several times Some affirm
that there is a smell of Brimstone in the Cabins when they are Conjuring
which I cannot contradict Which way it may come I will not argue
but proceed to a Relation or two which I have from a great many Persons
and some of them worthy of Credit

Indian Robbery
The first is of a certain Indian that one rainy Night undermind a House
made of Logs such as the Swedes in America very often make
and are very strong which belongd to Seth Southwell Esq
Governor of NorthCarolina and one of the Proprietors
There was but one place the Indian could get in at which was very narrow
the rest was securd by having Barrels of Pork and other Provisions
set against the side of the House so that if this Indian
had not exactly hit the very Place he undermind it had been impossible
for him to have got therein because of the full Barrels that stood
round the House and barricadoed it within The Indian stole
sixty or eighty dressd DeerSkins besides Blankets Powder Shot and Rum
this being the Indian StoreHouse where the Trading Goods were kept
Now the Indian had made his Escape but dropt some of the Skins by the way
and they trackd his Footsteps and found him to be an Indian
then they guessd who it was because none but that Indian
had lately been near the House Thereupon the Governor sent
to the Indian Town that he belongd to which was the Tuskeruros
and acquainted them that if they did not deliver up the Indian
who had committed the Robbery he would take a Course with them
that would not be very agreeable Upon this the Indians of the Town
he belongd to brought him in bound and deliverd him up to the Governor
who laid him in Irons At the same time it happend
that a Robbery was committed amongst themselves at the Indian Town
and this Prisoner was one of their Conjurers so the Indians came down
to the Governors House and acquainted him with what had happend
amongst them and that a great Quantity of Peak was stoln away
out of one of their Cabins and no one could find out the Thief
unless he would let the Prisoner conjure for it who was the only Man they had
at making such Discoveries The Governor was content he should try
his Skill for them but not to have the Prisoners Irons taken off
which was very well approved of The Indian was brought out in his Fetters
where were the Governors Family and several others of the Neighbourhood
now living to see this Experiment which he performd thus

Conjuring for stoln Goods
The Conjurer orderd three Fires to be made in a triangular Form
which was accordingly done then he was hoodwinkd very securely
with a dressd DeerSkin two or three doubles over his Face
After he had made some Motions as they always do he went directly
out of one of the three Gaps as exactly as if he had not been blindfolded
and kept muttering to himself having a Stick in his Hand
with which after some time he struck two Strokes very hard upon the Ground
and made thereon a Cross after which he told the Indians Name
that had stoln the Goods and said that he would have a Cross on his Back
which provd true for when they took and searchd him there appeard
two great Wheals on his Back one cross the other for the Thief
was at Governor Southwells House and was under no Apprehension
of being discoverd The Indians profferd to sell him as a Slave
to the Governor but he refused to buy him so they took him bound away

Another Instance of the like Nature happend at the same House
One of the Tuskeruro Kings had brought in a Slave to the same Governor
to whom he had sold him and before he returnd fell sick
at the Governors House upon which the Doctor that belongd
to this Kings Nation was sent for being a Man that was held to be
the greatest Conjurer amongst them It was three Days
before he could arrive and he appeard when he came to be
a very little Man and so old that his Hair was as white as ever was seen
When he approachd the sick King he orderd a Bowl of Water
to be brought him and three Chunks of Wood which was immediately done
Then he took the Water and set it by him and spurted a little on him
and with the three Pieces of Wood he made a Place to stand on
whereby he was raisd higher he being a very low staturd Man then he took
a String of Ronoak which is the same as a String of small Beads
this he held by one End between his Fingers the other End touchd
the Kings Stomach as he stood on the Logs Then he began to talk
and at length the Bystanders thought really that they heard somebody
talk to him but saw no more than what first came in At last
this String of Beads which hung thus perpendicular turnd up
as an Eel would do and without any Motion of his they came all up
in a lump under his Hand and hung so for a considerable time
he never closing his Hand and at length returnd to their pristine
Length and Shape at which the Spectators were much frightned
Then he told the Company that he would recover and that his Distemper
would remove into his Leg all which happend to be exactly
as the Indian Doctor had told These are Matters of Fact and I can
at this day prove the Truth thereof by several substantial Evidences
that are Men of Reputation there being more than a dozen People present
when this was performd most of whom are now alive

SalmonCreek
There are a great many other Stories of this Nature
which are seemingly true being told by Persons that affirm
they were EyeWitnesses thereof as that they have seen one Roncommock
a Chuwou Indian and a great Conjurer take a Reed about two Foot long
in his Mouth and stand by a Creekside where he calld twice or thrice
with the Reed in his Mouth and at last has opend his Arms
and fled over the Creek which might be near a quarter of a Mile wide or more
but I shall urge no Mans Belief but tell my own which is that I believe
the two first Accounts which were acted at Mr Southwells Plantation
as firmly as any Man can believe any thing of that which is told him
by honest Men and he has not seen not at all doubting
the Credit of my Authors

The Cures I have seen performd by the Indians are too many
to repeat here so I shall only mention some few and their Method
Scald Head cured They cure Scaldheads infallibly and never miss
Their chief Remedy as I have seen them make use of is the Oil of Acorns
but from which sort of Oak I am not certain They cure Burns beyond Credit
I have seen a Man burnt in such a manner when drunk by falling into a Fire
that I did not think he could recover yet they curd him in ten Days
so that he went about I knew another blown up with Powder
that was cured to Admiration No ulcerated Wounds I never saw an Indian
have an Ulcer or foul Wound in my Life neither is there any such thing
to be found amongst them Pox to cure They cure the Pox by a Berry
that salivates as Mercury does yet they use Sweating and Decoctions
very much with it as they do almost on every Occasion
and when they are thoroughly heated they leap into the River
The Pox is frequent in some of these Nations amongst which
I knew one Woman die of it and they could not or would not cure her
Before she died she was worn away to a Skeleton yet walkd up and down
to the last We had a Planter in Carolina who had got an Ulcer in his Leg
which had troubled him a great many Years at last he applyd himself
to one of these Indian Conjurers who was a Pampticough Indian
and was not to give the Value of fifteen Shillings for the Cure
Indian cure an Ulcer Now I am not positive whether he washd the Ulcer
with any thing before he used what I am now going to speak of
which was nothing but the rotten doated Grains of Indian Corn
beaten to Powder and the soft Down growing on a Turkeys Rump
This dryd the Ulcer up immediately and no other Fontanel was made
to discharge the Matter he remaining a healthful Man
till the time he had the Misfortune to be drownd which was many Years after
Cure in Maryland Another Instance not of my own Knowledge
but I had it confirmd by several Dwellers in Maryland
where it was done was of an honest Planter that had been possessd
with a strange Lingring Distemper not usual amongst them
under which he emaciated and grew every Month worse than another
it having held him several Years in which time he had made Tryal
of several Doctors as they call them which I suppose were ShipSurgeons
In the beginning of this Distemper the Patient was very well to pass
and was possessd of several Slaves which the Doctors purged all away
and the poor Man was so far from mending that he grew worse and worse
every day But it happend that one day as his Wife and he
were commiserating his miserable Condition and that he could not expect
to recover but lookd for Death very speedily and condoling the Misery
he should leave his Wife and Family in since all his Negros were gone
At that time I say it happend that an Indian was in the same Room
who had frequented the House for many Years and so was become
as one of the Family and would sometimes be at this Planters House
and at other times amongst the Indians

This Savage hearing what they talkd of and having a great Love
for the Sick Man made this Reply to what he had heard
Brother you have been a long time Sick and I know you have
given away your Slaves to your English Doctors What made you do so
and now become poor They do not know how to cure you
for it is an Indian Distemper which your People know not the Nature of
If it had been an English Disease probably they could have cured you
and had you come to me at first I would have cured you for a small matter
without taking away your Servants that made Corn for you and your Family
to eat and yet if you will give me a Blanket to keep me warm
and some Powder and Shot to kill Deer withal I will do my best
to make you well still The Man was low in Courage and Pocket too
and made the Indian this Reply Jack my Distemper is past Cure
and if our English Doctors cannot cure it I am sure the Indians cannot
But his Wife accosted her Husband in very mild terms and told him
he did not know but God might be pleased to give a Blessing
to that Indians Undertaking more than he had done to the English
and farther added if you die I cannot be much more miserable
by giving this small matter to the Indian so I pray you my Dear
take my Advice and try him to which by her Persuasions he consented
After the Bargain was concluded the Indian went into the Woods
and brought in both Herbs and Roots of which he made a Decoction
and gave it the Man to drink and bad him go to bed saying
it should not be long before he came again which the Patient performd
as he had ordered and the Potion he had administred made him sweat
after the most violent manner that could be whereby he smelld
very offensively both to himself and they that were about him
but in the Evening towards Night Jack came with a great RattleSnake
in his Hand alive which frightned the People almost out of their Senses
Cure by a Snake and he told his Patient that he must take that
to Bed to him at which the Man was in a great Consternation
and told the Indian he was resolvd to let no Snake come into his Bed
for he might as well die of the Distemper he had as be killd
with the Bite of that Serpent To which the Indian replyd
he could not bite him now nor do him any Harm for he had taken out
his Poisonteeth and shewd him that they were gone At last
with much Persuasion he admitted the Snakes Company which the Indian
put about his Middle and orderd nobody to take him away upon any account
which was strictly observd although the Snake girded him as hard
for a great while as if he had been drawn in by a Belt which one pulld at
with all his strength At last the Snakes Twitches grew weaker and weaker
till by degrees he felt him not and opening the Bed he was found dead
and the Man thought himself better The Indian came in the Morning
and seeing the Snake dead told the Man that his Distemper was dead
along with that Snake which provd so as he said for the Man
speedily recoverd his Health and became perfectly well

Spleen how cure
They cure the Spleen which they are much addicted to by burning with a Reed
They lay the Patient on his Back so put a hollow Cane into the Fire
where they burn the End thereof till it is very hot and on Fire at the end
Then they lay a Piece of thin Leather on the Patients Belly
between the Pit of the Stomach and the Navel so press the hot Reed
on the Leather which burns the Patient so that you may ever after see
the Impression of the Reed where it was laid on which Mark never goes off
so long as he lives This is used for the BellyAch sometimes
Colouring of the Hair They can colour their Hair black
though sometimes it is reddish which they do with the Seed of a Flower
that grows commonly in their Plantations I believe this would change
the reddest Hair into perfect black Not many Tears Rozins
They make use of no Minerals in their Physick and not much of Animals
but chiefly rely on Vegetables They have several Remedies for the Toothach
which often drive away the Pain but if they fail they have Recourse
to punching out the Tooth with a small Cane set against the same
on a Bit of Leather Then they strike the Reed and so drive out the Tooth
and howsoever it may seem to the Europeans I prefer it before
the common way of drawing Teeth by those Instruments than endanger the Jaw
and a Flux of Blood often follows which this Method of a Punch
never is attended withal neither is it half the Pain
The Spontaneous Plants of America the Savages are well acquainted withal
and a Flux of Blood never follows any of their Operations
They are wholly Strangers to Amputation and for what natural Issues of Blood
happen immoderately they are not to seek for a certain and speedy Cure
Tears Rozins and Gums I have not discoverd that they make much use of
And as for Purging and Emeticks so much in fashion with us
they never apply themselves to Yaupon unless in drinking
vast Quantities of their Yaupon or Tea and vomiting it up again
as clear as they drink it This is a Custom amongst all those
that can procure that Plant in which manner they take it every other Morning
or oftner by which Method they keep their Stomachs clean
without pricking the Coats and straining Nature as every Purge
is an Enemy to Besides the great Diuretick Quality of their Tea
carries off a great deal that perhaps might prejudice their Health
by Agues and Fevers which all watry Countries are addicted to
for which reason I believe it is that the Indians are not so much
addicted to that Distemper as we are they preventing its seizing upon them
by this Plant alone Moreover I have remarkd that it is only those Places
bordering on the Ocean and great Rivers that this Distemper is frequent in
and only on and near the same Places this Evergreen is to be found
and none up towards the Mountains where these Agues seldom or never appear
Nature having provided suitable Remedies in all Countries
proper for the Maladies that are common thereto The Savages of Carolina
have this Tea in Veneration above all the Plants they are acquainted withal
and tell you the Discovery thereof was by an infirm Indian
that labourd under the Burden of many rugged Distempers
and could not be cured by all their Doctors so one day
he fell asleep and dreamt that if he took a Decoction of the Tree
that grew at his Head he would certainly be cured upon which he awoke
and saw the Yaupon or CassenaTree which was not there
when he fell asleep He followd the Direction of his Dream
and became perfectly well in a short time Now I suppose
no Man has so little Sense as to believe this Fable yet it lets us see
what they intend thereby and that it has doubtless workd Feats enough
to gain it such an Esteem amongst these Savages who are too well versed
in Vegetables to be brought to a continual use of any one of them
upon a meer Conceit or Fancy without some apparent Benefit
they found thereby especially when we are sensible
they drink the Juices of Plants to free Nature of her Burdens
and not out of Foppery and Fashion as other Nations are oftentimes
found to do Amongst all the Discoveries of America
by the Missionaries of the French and Spaniards I wonder none of them
was so kind to the World as to have kept a Catalogue of the Distempers
they found the Savages capable of curing and their Method of Cure
which might have been of some Advantage to our Materia Medica at home
when deliverd by Men of Learning and other Qualifications
as most of them are Authors generally tell us that the Savages
are well enough acquainted with those Plants which their Climate affords
and that some of them effect great Cures but by what Means
and in what Form we are left in the dark Sassafras
The Bark of the Root of the SassafrasTree I have observd
is much used by them They generally torrefy it in the Embers
so strip off the Bark from the Root beating it to a Consistence
fit to spread so lay it on the grievd Part which both cleanses
a fowl Ulcer and after Scarrification being applyd to a Contusion
or Swelling draws forth the Pain and reduces the Part to its pristine
State of Health as I have often seen effected Fats and Unguents
never appear in their Chirurgery when the Skin is once broke
The Fats of Animals are used by them to render their Limbs pliable
and when wearied to relieve the Joints and this not often
because they approve of the SweatingHouse in such cases above all things
Make Bread how Alkali Salts The Salts they mix
with their Bread and Soupe to give them a Relish are Alkalis
viz Ashes and calcined Bones of Deer and other Animals
No Sallads Pepper or Mustard Sallads they never eat any
as for Pepper and Mustard they reckon us little better than Madmen
to make use of it amongst our Victuals They are never troubled
with the Scurvy Dropsy nor Stone The Phthisick Asthma and Diabetes
they are wholly Strangers to neither do I remember I ever saw
one Paralytick amongst them The Gout I cannot be certain
whether they know what it is or not Indeed I never saw
any Nodes or Swellings which attend the Gout in Europe
Rhumatick Pains yet they have a sort of Rhumatism or Burning of the Limbs
which tortures them grievously at which time their Legs are so hot
that they employ the young People continually to pour Water down them
I never saw but one or two thus afflicted The Struma is not uncommon
amongst these Savages and another Distemper which is in some respects
like the Pox but is attended with no Gonorrhoea This not seldom
bereaves them of their Nose I have seen three or four of them
renderd most miserable Spectacles by this Distemper
Yet when they have been so negligent as to let it run on so far
without curbing of it at last they make shift to patch themselves up
and live for many years after and such Men commonly turn Doctors
I have known two or three of these nonose Doctors in great Esteem
amongst these Savages The Juice of the TulipTree is used
as a proper Remedy for this Distemper What Knowledge they have in Anatomy
I cannot tell neither did I ever see them employ themselves therein
unless as I told you before when they make the Skeletons
of their Kings and great Mens Bones

The Indians are very careless and negligent of their Health
as by Drunkenness Wading in the Water irregular Diet and Lodging
and a thousand other Disorders that would kill an European
which they daily use They boil and roast their Meat extraordinary much
and eat abundance of Broth Naked Indians except the Savages
whom we call the naked Indians who never eat any Soupe
They travel from the Banks of the Messiasippi to war against
the Sinnagars or Iroquois and are if equal Numbers
commonly too hard for them They will lie and sleep in the Woods
without Fire being inurd thereto They are the hardiest of all Indians
and run so fast that they are never taken neither do any Indians
outrun them if they are pursud Their Savage Enemies say
their Nimbleness and Wind proceeds from their never eating any Broth
SmallPox The SmallPox has been fatal to them they do not often escape
when they are seizd with that Distemper which is a contrary Fever
to what they ever knew Most certain it had never visited America
before the Discovery thereof by the Christians Their running into the Water
in the Extremity of this Disease strikes it in and kills all that use it
Now they are become a little wiser but formerly it destroyd whole Towns
without leaving one Indian alive in the Village The Plague was never known
amongst them that I could learn by what Enquiry I have made
These Savages use Scarrification almost in all Distempers
Their chief Instruments for that Operation is the Teeth of RattleSnakes
which they poison withal They take them out of the Snakes Head
and suck out the Poison with their Mouths and so keep them for use
and spit out the Venom which is green and are never damagd thereby
The SmallPox and Rum have made such a Destruction amongst them
that on good grounds I do believe there is not the sixth Savage living
within two hundred Miles of all our Settlements as there were
fifty Years ago These poor Creatures have so many Enemies to destroy them
that its a wonder one of them is left alive near us The Smallpox
I have acquainted you withal above and so I have of Rum and shall only add
that they have got a way to carry it back to the Westward Indians
who never knew what it was till within very few Years Now they have it
brought them by the Tuskeruros and other NeighbourIndians
but the Tuskeruros chiefly who carry it in Rundlets several hundred Miles
amongst other Indians Sometimes they cannot forbear breaking their Cargo
but sit down in the Woods and drink it all up and then hollow and shout
like so many Bedlamites I accidentally once met with one of these
drunken Crews and was amazd to see a Parcel of drunken Savages
so far from any Englishmans House but the Indians I had in Company
informd me that they were Merchants and had drunk all their Stock
as is very common for them to do But when they happen to carry it safe
which is seldom without drinking some part of it and filling it up
with Water and come to an Indian Town those that buy Rum of them
have so many Mouthfuls for a BuckSkin they never using any other Measure
and for this purpose the Buyer always makes Choice of his Man
which is one that has the greatest Mouth whom he brings to the Market
with a Bowl to put it in The Seller looks narrowly to the Mans Mouth
that measures it and if he happens to swallow any down
either through Wilfulness or otherwise the Merchant or some of his Party
does not scruple to knock the Fellow down exclaiming against him
for false Measure Thereupon the Buyer finds another Mouthpiece
to measure the Rum by so that this Trading is very agreeable
to the Spectators to see such a deal of Quarrelling and Controversy
as often happens about it and is very diverting

Poisoning of Taylor
Another Destroyer of them is the Art they have and often practise
of poisoning one another which is done by a large white spungy Root
that grows in the FreshMarshes which is one of their Poisons
not but that they have many other Drugs which they poison one another withal

How the Indians war
Lastly the continual Wars these Savages maintain one Nation against another
which sometimes hold for some Ages killing and making Captives
till they become so weak thereby that they are forced to make Peace
for want of Recruits to supply their Wars and the Difference of Languages
that is found amongst these Heathens seems altogether strange
For it often appears that every dozen Miles you meet with an Indian Town
that is quite different from the others you last parted withal
and what a little supplies this Defect is that the most powerful
Nation of these Savages scorns to treat or trade with any others
of fewer Numbers and less Power in any other Tongue but their own
which serves for the Lingua of the Country with which we travel and deal
as for Example we see that the Tuskeruros are most numerous
in NorthCarolina therefore their Tongue is understood by some
in every Town of all the Indians near us And here I shall insert
a small Dictionary of every Tongue though not Alphabetically digested

Indian Speech
To repeat more of this Indian Jargon would be to trouble the Reader
and as an Account how imperfect they are in their Moods and Tenses
has been given by several already I shall only add that their
Languages or Tongues are so deficient that you cannot suppose
the Indians ever could express themselves in such a Flight of Stile
as Authors would have you believe They are so far from it
that they are but just able to make one another understand readily
what they talk about As for the two Consonants L and F
I never knew them in any Indian Speech I have met withal
yet I must tell you that they have such a Way of abbreviating their Speech
when in their great Councils and Debates that the young Men do not understand
what they treat about when they hear them argue It is wonderful
what has occasiond so many different Speeches as the Savages have
Tartarian Hurds The three Nations I now mentiond
do not live above ten Leagues distant and two of them
viz the Tuskeruros and the Woccon are not two Leagues asunder
yet their Speech differs in every Word thereof except one
which is Tsaure Cockles which is in both Tongues the same
and nothing else Now this Difference of Speech causes
Jealousies and Fears amongst them which bring Wars wherein they destroy
one another otherwise the Christians had not in all Probability
settled America so easily as they have done had these Tribes of Savages
united themselves into one People or general Interest or were they so
but every hundred Miles In short they are an odd sort of People
under the Circumstances they are at present and have some such uncouth Ways
in their Management and Course of Living that it seems a Miracle to us
how they bring about their Designs as they do when their Ways
are commonly quite contrary to ours I believe they are as to this Life
a very happy People and were it not for the Feuds amongst themselves
they would enjoy the happiest State in this World of all Mankind
They met with Enemies when we came amongst them for they are
no nearer Christianity now than they were at the first Discovery
to all Appearance Indians learn of the Europeans
They have learnt several Vices of the Europeans but not one Vertue
as I know of Drunkenness was a Stranger when we found them out
and Swearing their Speech cannot express yet those that speak English
learn to swear the first thing they talk of Its true
they have some Vertues and some Vices but how the Christians
can bring these People into the Bosom of the Church is a Proposal
that ought to be formd and followd by the wisest Heads and best Christians
After I have given one Remark or two farther of some of their
strange Practices and Notions I will give my Opinion how I think
in probability it may be if possible effected and so shall conclude
this Treatise of Carolina

They are a very craving People and if a Man give them any thing of a Present
they think it obliges him to give them another and so on
till he has given them all he has for they have no Bounds of Satisfaction
in that way and if they give you any thing it is to receive
twice the Value of it They have no Consideration that you will want
what you give them for their way of Living is so contrary to ours
that neither we nor they can fathom one anothers Designs and Methods
They call Rum and Physick by one Name which implies that Rum
make People sick as when they have taken any poisonous Plant
yet they cannot forbear Rum They make Offerings of their FirstFruits
and the more serious sort of them throw into the Ashes near the Fire
the first Bit or Spoonful of every Meal they sit down to which they say
is the same to them as the pulling off our Hats and talking
when we go to Victuals is to us They name the Months very agreeably
as one is the HerringMonth another the StrawberryMonth
another the MulberryMonth Others name them by the Trees that blossom
especially the DogwoodTree or they say we will return
when TurkeyCocks gobble that is in March and April The Age of the Moon
they understand but know no different Name for Sun and Moon
They can guess well at the time of the Day by the Suns Height
Their Age they number by Winters and say such a Man or Woman
is so many Winters old They have no Sabbath or Day of Rest
Their Slaves are not overburdend with Work and so not driven by Severity
to seek for that Relief Those that are acquainted with the English
and speak the Tongue know when Sunday comes besides the Indians have
a distinct Name for Christmas which they call Winnick Keshuse
or the Englishmans Gods Moon There is one most abominable Custom
amongst them which they call Husquenawing their young Men
which I have not made any Mention of as yet so will give you
an Account of it here You must know that most commonly once a Year
or at farthest once in two Years these People take up
so many of their young Men as they think are able to undergo it
and husquenaugh them which is to make them obedient and respective
to their Superiors and as they say is the same to them
as it is to us to send our Children to School to be taught
good Breeding and Letters This House of Correction is a large strong Cabin
made on purpose for the Reception of the young Men and Boys
that have not passed this Graduation already and it is always at Christmas
that they husquenaugh their Youth which is by bringing them
into this House and keeping them dark all the time where they
more than halfstarve them Besides they give them PellitoryBark
and several intoxicating Plants that make them go raving mad
as ever were any People in the World and you may hear them make
the most dismal and hellish Cries and Howlings that ever
humane Creatures expressd all which continues about five or six Weeks
and the little Meat they eat is the nastiest loathsome stuff
and mixt with all manner of Filth its possible to get
After the Time is expired they are brought out of the Cabin
which never is in the Town but always a distance off and guarded by
a Jaylor or two who watch by Turns Now when they first come out
they are as poor as ever any Creatures were for you must know several die
under this diabolical Purgation Moreover they either really are
or pretend to be dumb and do not speak for several Days
I think twenty or thirty and look so gastly and are so changd
that its next to an Impossibility to know them again
although you was never so well acquainted with them before
I would fain have gone into the mad House and have seen them
in their time of Purgatory but the King would not suffer it
because he told me they would do me or any other white Man an Injury
that ventured in amongst them so I desisted They play this Prank
with Girls as well as Boys and I believe it a miserable Life they endure
because I have known several of them run away at that time to avoid it
Now the Savages say if it was not for this they could never keep
their Youth in Subjection besides that it hardens them ever after
to the Fatigues of War Hunting and all manner of Hardship
which their way of living exposes them to Besides they add
that it carries off those infirm weak Bodies that would have been only
a Burden and Disgrace to their Nation and saves the Victuals and Cloathing
for better People that would have been expended on such useless Creatures
These Savages are described in their proper Colours but by a very few
for those that generally write Histories of this new World
are such as Interest Preferment and Merchandize drew thither
and know no more of that People than I do of the Laplanders
which is only by Hearsay And if we will make just Remarks
how near such Relations generally approach Truth and Nicety
we shall find very few of them worthy of Entertainment and as for
the other part of the Volume it is generally stufft with Invectives
against the Government they lived under on which Stage is commonly acted
greater Barbarities in Murdering worthy Mens Reputations
than all the Savages in the new World are capable of equalizing
or so much as imitating

And since I hinted at a Regulation of the Savages and to propose a way
to convert them to Christianity I will first particularize
the several Nations of Indians that are our Neighbours
and then proceed to what I promisd

Tuskeruro Indians are fifteen Towns viz Haruta Waqui Contahnah
Anna Ooka ConauhKare Harooka Una Nauhan Kentanuska Chunaneets
Kenta Eno Naurheghne Oonossoora Tosneoc Nonawharitse Nursoorooka
Fighting Men 1200 Waccon Towns 2 Yupwauremau Tooptatmeer
Fighting Men 120 Machapunga Town 1 Maramiskeet Fighting Men 30
Bear River Town 1 Raudauquaquank Fighting Men 50
Maherring Indians Town 1 Maherring River Fighting Men 50
Chuwon Indians Town 1 Bennets Creek Fighting Men 15
Paspatank Indians Town 1 Paspatank River Fighting Men 10
Poteskeit Town 1 North River Fighting Men 30 Nottaway Indians
Town 1 Winoack Creek Fighting Men 30 Hatteras Town 1 Sand Banks
Fighting Men 16 Connamox Indians Towns 2 Coranine Raruta
Fighting Men 25 Neus Indians Towns 2 Chattooka Rouconk
Fighting Men 15 Pampticough Indians Town 1 Island Fighting Men 15
Jaupim Indians 6 People These five Nations of the Toteros Saponas
Keiauwees Aconechos and Schoccories are lately come amongst us
and may contain in all about 750 Men Women and Children Total 4780

Now there appears to be one thousand six hundred and twelve
Fighting Men of our Neighbouring Indians and probably
there are three Fifths of Women and Children not including Old Men
which amounts to four thousand and thirty Savages besides the five Nations
lately come Now as I before hinted we will see what grounds there are
to make these People serviceable to us and better themselves thereby

On a fair Scheme we must first allow these Savages what really
belongs to them that is what good Qualities and natural Endowments
they possess whereby they being in their proper Colours
the Event may be better guessd at and fathomd

First they are as apt to learn any Handicraft as any People
that the World affords I will except none as is seen
by their Canoes and Stauking Heads which they make of themselves
but to my purpose the Indian Slaves in South Carolina and elsewhere
make my Argument good

Secondly we have no disciplind Men in Europe but what have
at one time or other been branded with Mutining and Murmuring against
their Chiefs These Savages are never found guilty of that great Crime
in a Soldier I challenge all Mankind to tell me of one Instance of it
besides they never prove Traitors to their Native Country
but rather chuse Death than partake and side with the Enemy

They naturally possess the Righteous Mans Gift they are Patient
under all Afflictions and have a great many other Natural Vertues
which I have slightly touchd throughout the Account of these Savages

They are really better to us than we are to them they always give us
Victuals at their Quarters and take care we are armd against
Hunger and Thirst We do not so by them generally speaking
but let them walk by our Doors Hungry and do not often relieve them
We look upon them with Scorn and Disdain and think them little better
than Beasts in Humane Shape though if well examined we shall find that
for all our Religion and Education we possess more Moral Deformities
and Evils than these Savages do or are acquainted withal

We reckon them Slaves in Comparison to us and Intruders
as oft as they enter our Houses or hunt near our Dwellings
But if we will admit Reason to be our Guide she will inform us
that these Indians are the freest People in the World
and so far from being Intruders upon us that we have abandond
our own Native Soil to drive them out and possess theirs
neither have we any true Balance in Judging of these poor Heathens
because we neither give Allowance for their Natural Disposition
nor the Sylvian Education and strange Customs uncouth to us
they lie under and have ever been traind up to these are false Measures
for Christians to take and indeed no Man can be reckond a Moralist only
who will not make choice and use of better Rules to walk and act by
We trade with them its true but to what End Not to shew them
the Steps of Vertue and the Golden Rule to do as we would be done by
No we have furnished them with the Vice of Drunkenness
which is the open Road to all others and daily cheat them
in every thing we sell and esteem it a Gift of Christianity
not to sell to them so cheap as we do to the Christians
as we call our selves Pray let me know where is there to be found
one Sacred Command or Precept of our Master that counsels us
to such Behaviour Besides I believe it will not appear
but that all the Wars which we have had with the Savages
were occasiond by the unjust Dealings of the Christians towards them
I can name more than a few which my own Enquiry has given me
a right Understanding of and I am afraid the remainder
if they come to the test will prove themselves Birds of the same Feather

Indians Aversion to Christianity
As we are in Christian Duty bound so we must act and behave ourselves
to these Savages if we either intend to be serviceable in converting them
to the Knowledge of the Gospel or discharge the Duty which every Man
within the Pale of the Christian Church is bound to do
Upon this Score we ought to shew a Tenderness for these Heathens
under the weight of Infidelity let us cherish their good Deeds
and with Mildness and Clemency make them sensible and forwarn them
of their ill ones let our Dealings be just to them in every Respect
and shew no ill Example whereby they may think we advise them
to practise that which we will not be conformable to ourselves
Let them have cheap Penniworths without Guile in our Trading with them
and learn them the Mysteries of our Handicrafts as well as our Religion
otherwise we deal unjustly by them But it is highly necessary
to be brought in Practice which is to give Encouragement
to the ordinary People and those of a lower Rank that they might marry
with these Indians and come into Plantations and Houses
where so many Acres of Land and some Gratuity of Money
out of a publick Stock are given to the newmarried Couple
and that the Indians might have Encouragement to send their Children
Apprentices to proper Masters that would be kind to them and make them
Masters of a Trade whereby they would be drawn to live amongst us
and become Members of the same Ecclesiastical and Civil Government
we are under then we should have great Advantages to make daily Conversions
amongst them when they saw that we were kind and just to them
in all our Dealings Moreover by the Indians Marrying with the Christians
and coming into Plantations with their English Husbands or Wives
they would become Christians and their Idolatry would be quite forgotten
and in all probability a better Worship come in its Stead
for were the Jews engrafted thus and alienated from
the Worship and Conversation of Jews their Abominations would vanish
and be no more

Thus we should be let into a better Understanding of the Indian Tongue
by our new Converts and the whole Body of these People
would arrive to the Knowledge of our Religion and Customs
and become as one People with us By this Method also we should have
a true Knowledge of all the Indians Skill in Medicine and Surgery
they would inform us of the Situation of our Rivers Lakes
and Tracts of Land in the Lords Dominions where by their Assistance
greater Discoveries may be made than has been hitherto found out
and by their Accompanying us in our Expeditions we might civilize
a great many other Nations of the Savages and daily add to our Strength
in Trade and Interest so that we might be sufficiently enabled to conquer
or maintain our Ground against all the Enemies to the Crown of England
in America both Christian and Savage

What Children we have of theirs to learn Trades c ought to be put
into those Hands that are Men of the best Lives and Characters
and that are not only strict Observers of their Religion
but also of a mild winning and sweet Disposition that these Indian Parents
may often go and see how well their Children are dealt with
which would much win them to our Ways of Living Mildness being a Vertue
the Indians are in love withal for they do not practise
beating and correcting their Children as we do A general Complaint is
that it seems impossible to convert these People to Christianity
as at first sight it does and as for those in New Spain they have
the Prayer of that Church in Latin by Rote and know the external Behaviour at
Mass and Sermons yet scarce any of them are steady and abide with constancy
in good Works and the Duties of the Christian Church We find that
the Fuentes and several other of the noted Indian Families about Mexico
and in other parts of New Spain had given several large Gifts
to the Altar and outwardly seemd fond of their new Religion
yet those that were the greatest Zealots outwards on a strict Enquiry
were found guilty of Idolatry and Witchcraft and this seems to proceed from
their Cohabiting which as I have noted before gives Opportunities of Cabals
to recal their ancient pristine Infidelity and Superstitions They never
argue against our Religion but with all imaginable Indifference own
that it is most proper for us that have been brought up in it

In my opinion its better for Christians of a mean Fortune
to marry with the Civilizd Indians than to suffer
the Hardships of four or five years Servitude in which they meet
with Sickness and Seasonings amidst a Crowd of other Afflictions
which the Tyranny of a bad Master lays upon such poor Souls all which
those acquainted with our Tobacco Plantations are not Strangers to

This seems to be a more reasonable Method of converting the Indians
than to set up our Christian Banner in a Field of Blood as the Spaniards
have done in New Spain and baptize one hundred with the Sword
for one at the Font Whilst we make way for a Christian Colony
through a Field of Blood and defraud and make away with those
that one day may be wanted in this World and in the next appear against us
we make way for a more potent Christian Enemy to invade us hereafter
of which we may repent when too late

 An
 ABSTRACT
 of the
 CONSTITUTION
 of
 CAROLINA




As to the Government of Carolina the Laws of England are there in Force
yet the LordsProprietors by their Deputies have Power
with the Consent of the Inhabitants to make ByLaws for the better Government
of the said Province so that no Law can be made or Money raisd
unless the Inhabitants or their Representatives consent thereto
One Law which they have in SouthCarolina deserves particular Mention
which is their Method of chusing Juries it being done by making
a considerable Number of PaperBillets on which are written
the Names of as many of the most substantial Freeholders
These Billets are put into a Hat out of which Twentyfour are chosen
by the next Child that appears Then out of those Twentyfour
Twelve are chosen at the next Court after the same manner
which is an infallible way to prevent all Manner of Fraud

North and SouthCarolina Settlements are distant from one another
some hundreds of Miles so that Necessity compels each Colony
to keep to themselves a Governour Council and Assembly
The Governor represents the LordPalatine the rest of the Counsellors
are the LordDeputies who of themselves make a Palatines Court
and a Court of Chancery wherein they pass several Orders of Council
much of the Nature of the Princes Proclamation which continues
no longer in Force than the next Assembly Likewise they grant
several sorts of Commissions Warrants c yet Military Commissions
lie wholly in the Governors Power but Making of War or Peace in all
or the Majority of the LordsDeputies by whom the Governor being one
it is determind and by whose Commissions all other Magistrates act
On these Heads they have settled and maintain an admirable
Constitution of Government for the lasting Peace Security and Wellbeing
of all the Inhabitants The way of any ones taking up his Land in Carolina
due to him either by Purchasing it of the Lords Proprietors here in England
who keep their Board at CravenHouse in DruryLane London
the first Thursday in every Month or if purchasd in Carolina
is after this manner He first looks out for a Place to his Mind
that is not already possessd by any other then applies himself
to the Governor and Lords Proprietors Deputies and shews what Right he hath
to such a Tract of Land either by Purchase of the Lords in England
or by an Entry in the SurveyorGenerals Office in order
to purchase of the Governor and Lords Deputies there in Carolina
who thereupon issue out their WarrantLand as is due to him
Who making Certificate that he had measured out so much Land and the Bounds
a Deed is prepared of Course by the Secretary which is signd
by the Governor and the Lords Proprietors Deputies and the Proprietors Seal
affixd to it and registerd in the Secretaries Office
which is a good Coveyance in Law of the Land therein mentiond
to the Party and his Heirs for ever


Thus have I given you as large and exact an Account of Carolina
as the Discovery of so few Years in this great and extensive Land
would permit Which flourishing Country will doubtless in time
increase the Number of its Productions and afford us plentifully
those Necessaries and rich Commodities which the Streights
Turky and other Countries supply us withal at present
and not seldom in their own Shipping whereas were those Merchandizes
the Produce of an English Plantation and brought us home
by our own Hands and Bottoms of what Advantage such an Improvement would be
to the Crown of GreatBritain and the People in general
I leave to Men of Reason and Experience to judge I do intend if God permit
by future Voyages after my Arrival in Carolina to pierce into
the Body of the Continent and what Discoveries and Observations
I shall at any time hereafter make will be communicated
to my Correspondents in England to be publishd having furnishd myself
with Instruments and other Necessaries for such Voyages


For the better Understanding of this Country I have already drawn
a very large and exact Map thereof as far as any Discoveries
have been yet made either by others or my self and have spared
neither Cost nor Pains to procure the most correct Maps and Journals thereof
that are extant in Print or in Manuscript This Map containing
nine Sheets of Imperial Paper and now fit for engraving
begins at Cape Henry in Virginia 37 deg N Lat and contains
all the Coasts of Carolina or Florida with the Bahama Islands
great Part of the Bay of Mexico and the Island of Cuba to the Southward
and several Degrees to the Westward of the Messiasippi River
with all the Indian Nations and Villages and their Numbers
which of them are subject to Carolina and trade with their People
what Places are convenient Factories and Forts to increase and secure
our Trade on the Messiasippi and what Forts and Factories
the French and Spaniards have gaind in those Latitudes
especially on the great River and the Neighbouring Streams all which
they illegally possess since the very Mouth of the River Messiasippi
is in the King of Englands Grant to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina
it falling something to the Northward of 29 Degr North Lat
whose Claim and Right I question not but a Peace will adjust and restore
which every Englishman is bound in Duty and Interest to wish for
if we consider how advantageously they have seated themselves
whereby to disturb the Peace and Interest of all the English Plantations
on the Continent of America

Transcribers Notes to etext


This book was originally published in London in 1709
This text follows the original spellings which are somewhat irregular
though still quite readable

A footnote from William Gilmore Simms Life of Francis Marion online

 Lawsons Journal of a Thousand Miles Travel among the Indians
 from South to North Carolina is a work equally rare and interesting
 This unfortunate man fell a victim to his official duties
 He was confounded by the savages with the government which he represented
 and sacrificed to their fury under the charge of depriving them
 by his surveys of their land He was made captive
 with the Baron de Graffenreid The latter escaped
 but Lawson was subjected to the firetorture

Simms however was never a stickler for details Other accounts differ
as to John Lawsons exact fate and no one is sure how he died

Mike Lawson MIKE_LAWSONinterteccom httpwwwmixbookscom
a direct descendant of the author contacted me while I was working
on putting this book online and sent me some interesting information
which is summarized below Baron de Graffenreid  Degraffenreid etc

From about 1705 to 1708 John Lawson had lived in Bath Town NC
where his primary interests were his orchards and vines
When he went to England to have his book published he was called upon
by the Lord Proprietors to assist DeGraffenreid who was trying to settle
a colony of Palatines in North Carolina Franz Louis Michel
of Bern Switzerland Lawson refers to him as FrancisLouis Mitchell
had come to America in 1702 and discovered evidence of silver
in the mountains He returned to Europe to start a company
to found a colony in America and met Degraffenreid who had similar plans
and had already contracted with the city of Bern to remove some Anabaptists
to America  they formed a partnership and intended to search for silver
After the course of events which included John Lawsons death
and a massacre of these colonists they had a falling out
and that plan never came off

According to De Graffenreid some days before the New Bern massacre
John Lawson proposed that they go up the Neuse River
where there were plenty of wild grapes They were assured
that no savages lived on that branch of the river But to feel safer
we took two Indians to guide which we knew well with two negroes to row
Two days out near the village of Coram they were overtaken
by a large number of Tuscaroras and captured

There was a trial of sorts where their intentions were examined
and Mr Lawson was charged with being too severe and for selling their land
After a lengthy debate it was decided that they should be released
the next day but the following morning one Cor Tom reproached Mr Lawson
and they quarrelled I made every effort to get Lawson to quit quarrelling
I did not succeed All at once three or four Indians fell upon us
in a furious manner    They took our hats and periwigs and threw them
into the fire and a council of war being held we were immediately
sentenced to death One of the Indians a relation of King Taylor
from whom De Graffenreid had bought the land for New Bern
appealed in his behalf The Indians whispered in my ear
that I had nothing to fear but that Lawson would die what affected me much
They also liberated my negro but I never saw him since   
As to his death I know nothing Some said he was hung
some said he was burnt The Indians kept that execution very secret

The Tuscaroras then informed De Graffenreid that they were going to war
but would not harm Chattooka New Bern but that the people of New Bern
ought to stay in the town  unfortunately there was no way to inform
the people of New Bern Several days later prisoners were brought back
and De Graffenreid tells of recognizing some of them as his tenants
including a boy who reported that his whole family had been killed
After six weeks imprisonment at Catechna he was released
and returned to New Bern where the people were surprised to find him alive

The relevant passages from De Graffenreids journal were printed
in the North Carolina Booklet Vol I No 2 June 10 1901
Colonial New Bern by Mrs Sara Beaumont Kennedy pp 713
Issued by the North Carolina Society of the Daughters of the Revolution
Raleigh Capital Printing Company 1901


Due to the age of this book there are a number of nonstandard spellings
and the font used in the original with the ss much like fs
has surely led to an error or two in the transcription though every effort
was made to minimize this factor The standards of printing at the time
were also somewhat low and combine all this with those instances
where Indian names and words are given and some of the material
is doubtless inaccurate  though Lawsons comments on zoology
should make that quite clear Nonetheless this account remains
one of our best sources for information on the Indians of North Carolina
in and about the year 1700


Sidenotes throughout are presented in squiggly brackets As here
Where the sidenote precedes a paragraph it is given on a separate line

In An Account of the Indians of NorthCarolina the sidenotes
do not always perfectly match the text in the original In this edition
an attempt has been made to match them to the relevent text
The most notable changes are

p 204 side note Get Fire has been omitted as at the end of p 203
there is the note Get Fire how which refers to the same text
which is only broken by the turn of a page The second note
appears to serve no other purpose than continuity which is no longer needed

p 207 the side note Moss Match actually refers to text
that begins at the end of p 206 and in this edition the side note
has been inserted at the beginning of the relevant text

p 208

 Closing parenthesis was missing

pp 212213
Throughout the book a curious device is used  at the end of each page
on a separate line and rightjustified appears the first word
of the next page This does not generally need comment
but at the junction of pages 212 and 213 an error occurs
in that at the bottom of page 212 the nextwordtocome is given as being
but the first word on page 213 is because The latter is retained
and the former omitted as seeming best to fit the context
It is a possibility that both should have been retained
ie being because

p 214

 changed to

p 257

 changed to

I am unable to match all of Lawsons spellings with modern versions
especially when it comes to the names of people places and tribes

However quite likely

Tuscarora Tuskeruro and probably Turkeiruro also
Roanoke Ronoack
Neuse River NeusRiver
FallsofNeuse north of Raleigh Falls of NeusCreek
Deep River SaponaRiver possible  given as the West Branch of Cape Fair
Cape Fear Cape Fair
Haw River Hau River
Congaree Congeree
Wateree Waterree
Catawba Kadapau possible  the location seems correct
Waxhaw Waxsaw
Seneca Sinnager


RockyRiver is probably still Rocky River but there are two by that name
 in North Carolina and the one in question is doubtless the larger one
 situated between Haw River and Deep River


Other nonstandard spellings follow but first some notes
on how nonstandard items were handled in the text

 1 It seems as if off is occasionally spelled of
 but almost always in conjunction with far or the like
 ie not far of when farthest of On p 128 when cut of
 may also be an example In all these examples though
 of could be the correct word if used in the sense of from
 If is difficult to ascertain if the difference is spelling or usage
 2 Where modern English would always use than Lawson sometimes
 uses that This instance is repeated so it is not conclusively
 an error One example is on p 119 larger that a Panther
 3 Abbreviated words often end with an apostrophe rather than a period
 which is now the standard Through is usually abbreviated as thro
 4 Italics have been kept throughout with these notable exceptions
 in the original every case of c was italicized
 the sidenotes were entirely italicized except those words
 generally italicized in the text which were rendered in normal type 
 this has been reversed Where c appeared in an italicized section
 it was presented in normal type This too was ignored
 5 Printing was not as exact an art in 1709 as it is now
 and this should be kept in mind throughout the text
 As spelling was also not as standardized as it is now
 it is difficult to tell sometimes whether a word has an old spelling
 has a typographical error or refers to something entirely different
 from what the first impression would suggest In addition to this
 there is a problem of battered type which seems especially common
 in italic text  which unfortunately is commonly used here
 for words in Indian languages which makes reading the text
 extremely difficult at times And even without broken type
 as in Lawsons dictionary entry for A Rundlet perhaps a Roundlet
 a small round object he gives Ynpyupseunne as the Woccon term
 which remains unclear on several accounts as u and n
 were not infrequently accidentally inverted in old texts 
 ie it might be Yupyupseunne but where can we check it
 No exact answers can be given here but all these factors
 should be kept in mind when attempting to read this text
 Also in Lawsons Dictionary occur the Indian words
 Pulawa and Mifkissu  the latter has been rendered Miskissu
 as the old s and f were nearly identical and were probably
 inadvertently switched  which according to his own notes on p 231
 cannot happen there being no l or f sounds in the languages
 In this old type s has an flike appearance in most cases
 but a modern s was used if it was the last letter in a word
 which follows a similar usage with the s sound in the Greek alphabet
 It is much harder to guess what Pulawa ought to have been


Modern Spelling is listed first alternate spellings follow
More or less in the order they appear in the text

 1 When multiple spellings in text include the modern spelling
 it is not noted
 2 Any word ending in ed such as viewed may end in d
 as viewd This gets a little complicated in such cases
 as accompanyd accompanied tryd tried supplyd supplied
 carryd carried hurryd hurried and the like
 Also cases where the root word originally ended with an e
 such as usd and continud These cases are not always noted

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 wwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
