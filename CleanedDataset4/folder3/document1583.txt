THE ROSE OF DIXIE


When _The Rose of Dixie_ magazine was started by a stock company in
Toombs City Georgia there was never but one candidate for its chief
editorial position in the minds of its owners Col Aquila Telfair
was the man for the place By all the rights of learning family
reputation and Southern traditions he was its foreordained fit
and logical editor So a committee of the patriotic Georgia citizens
who had subscribed the founding fund of 100000 called upon Colonel
Telfair at his residence Cedar Heights fearful lest the enterprise
and the South should suffer by his possible refusal

The colonel received them in his great library where he spent most
of his days The library had descended to him from his father It
contained ten thousand volumes some of which had been published as
late as the year 1861 When the deputation arrived Colonel Telfair
was seated at his massive whitepine centretable reading Burtons
Anatomy of Melancholy He arose and shook hands punctiliously with
each member of the committee If you were familiar with _The Rose of
Dixie_ you will remember the colonels portrait which appeared in it
from time to time You could not forget the long carefully brushed
white hair the hooked highbridged nose slightly twisted to the
left the keen eyes under the still black eyebrows the classic mouth
beneath the drooping white mustache slightly frazzled at the ends

The committee solicitously offered him the position of managing editor
humbly presenting an outline of the field that the publication was
designed to cover and mentioning a comfortable salary The colonels
lands were growing poorer each year and were much cut up by red
gullies Besides the honor was not one to be refused

In a fortyminute speech of acceptance Colonel Telfair gave an
outline of English literature from Chaucer to Macaulay refought the
battle of Chancellorsville and said that God helping him he would
so conduct _The Rose of Dixie_ that its fragrance and beauty would
permeate the entire world hurling back into the teeth of the Northern
minions their belief that no genius or good could exist in the brains
and hearts of the people whose property they had destroyed and whose
rights they had curtailed

Offices for the magazine were partitioned off and furnished in the
second floor of the First National Bank building and it was for the
colonel to cause _The Rose of Dixie_ to blossom and flourish or to
wilt in the balmy air of the land of flowers

The staff of assistants and contributors that EditorColonel Telfair
drew about him was a peach It was a whole crate of Georgia peaches
The first assistant editor Tolliver Lee Fairfax had had a father
killed during Picketts charge The second assistant Keats Unthank
was the nephew of one of Morgans Raiders The book reviewer Jackson
Rockingham had been the youngest soldier in the Confederate army
having appeared on the field of battle with a sword in one hand and a
milkbottle in the other The art editor Roncesvalles Sykes was a
third cousin to a nephew of Jefferson Davis Miss Lavinia Terhune the
colonels stenographer and typewriter had an aunt who had once been
kissed by Stonewall Jackson Tommy Webster the head officeboy
got his job by having recited Father Ryans poems complete at the
commencement exercises of the Toombs City High School The girls who
wrapped and addressed the magazines were members of old Southern
families in Reduced Circumstances The cashier was a scrub named
Hawkins from Ann Arbor Michigan who had recommendations and a bond
from a guarantee company filed with the owners Even Georgia stock
companies sometimes realize that it takes live ones to bury the dead

Well sir if you believe me _The Rose of Dixie_ blossomed five times
before anybody heard of it except the people who buy their hooks and
eyes in Toombs City Then Hawkins climbed off his stool and told on
em to the stock company Even in Ann Arbor he had been used to having
his business propositions heard of at least as far away as Detroit So
an advertising manager was engagedBeauregard Fitzhugh Banks a young
man in a lavender necktie whose grandfather had been the Exalted High
Pillowslip of the Kuklux Klan

In spite of which _The Rose of Dixie_ kept coming out every month
Although in every issue it ran photos of either the Taj Mahal or
the Luxembourg Gardens or Carmencita or La Follette a certain
number of people bought it and subscribed for it As a boom for it
EditorColonel Telfair ran three different views of Andrew Jacksons
old home The Hermitage a fullpage engraving of the second battle
of Manassas entitled Lee to the Rear and a fivethousandword
biography of Belle Boyd in the same number The subscription list that
month advanced 118 Also there were poems in the same issue by Leonina
Vashti Haricot penname related to the Haricots of Charleston
South Carolina and Bill Thompson nephew of one of the stockholders
And an article from a special society correspondent describing a
teaparty given by the swell Boston and English set where a lot of
tea was spilled overboard by some of the guests masquerading as
Indians

One day a person whose breath would easily cloud a mirror he was so
much alive entered the office of _The Rose of Dixie_ He was a man
about the size of a realestate agent with a selftied tie and a
manner that he must have borrowed conjointly from W J Bryan
Hackenschmidt and Hetty Green He was shown into the editorcolonels
_pons asinorum_ Colonel Telfair rose and began a Prince Albert bow

Im Thacker said the intruder taking the editors chairT T
Thacker of New York

He dribbled hastily upon the colonels desk some cards a bulky manila
envelope and a letter from the owners of _The Rose of Dixie_ This
letter introduced Mr Thacker and politely requested Colonel Telfair
to give him a conference and whatever information about the magazine
he might desire

Ive been corresponding with the secretary of the magazine owners
for some time said Thacker briskly Im a practical magazine man
myself and a circulation booster as good as any if I do say it
Ill guarantee an increase of anywhere from ten thousand to a hundred
thousand a year for any publication that isnt printed in a dead
language Ive had my eye on _The Rose of Dixie_ ever since it
started I know every end of the business from editing to setting up
the classified ads Now Ive come down here to put a good bunch of
money in the magazine if I can see my way clear It ought to be made
to pay The secretary tells me its losing money I dont see why a
magazine in the South if its properly handled shouldnt get a good
circulation in the North too

Colonel Telfair leaned back in his chair and polished his goldrimmed
glasses

Mr Thacker said he courteously but firmly _The Rose of Dixie_
is a publication devoted to the fostering and the voicing of Southern
genius Its watchword which you may have seen on the cover is Of
For and By the South

But you wouldnt object to a Northern circulation would you asked
Thacker

I suppose said the editorcolonel that it is customary to open
the circulation lists to all I do not know I have nothing to do with
the business affairs of the magazine I was called upon to assume
editorial control of it and I have devoted to its conduct such poor
literary talents as I may possess and whatever store of erudition I
may have acquired

Sure said Thacker But a dollar is a dollar anywhere North
South or Westwhether youre buying codfish goober peas or Rocky
Ford cantaloupes Now Ive been looking over your November number I
see one here on your desk You dont mind running over it with me

Well your leading article is all right A good writeup of the
cottonbelt with plenty of photographs is a winner any time New York
is always interested in the cotton crop And this sensational account
of the HatfieldMcCoy feud by a schoolmate of a niece of the Governor
of Kentucky isnt such a bad idea It happened so long ago that most
people have forgotten it Now heres a poem three pages long called
The Tyrants Foot by Lorella Lascelles Ive pawed around a good
deal over manuscripts but I never saw her name on a rejection slip

Miss Lascelles said the editor is one of our most widely
recognized Southern poetesses She is closely related to the Alabama
Lascelles family and made with her own hands the silken Confederate
banner that was presented to the governor of that state at his
inauguration

But why persisted Thacker is the poem illustrated with a view of
the M  O Railroad freight depot at Tuscaloosa

The illustration said the colonel with dignity shows a corner
of the fence surrounding the old homestead where Miss Lascelles was
born

All right said Thacker I read the poem but I couldnt tell
whether it was about the depot of the battle of Bull Run Now heres
a short story called Rosies Temptation by Fosdyke Piggott Its
rotten What is a Piggott anyway

Mr Piggott said the editor is a brother of the principal
stockholder of the magazine

Alls right with the worldPiggott passes said Thacker Well this
article on Arctic exploration and the one on tarpon fishing might go
But how about this writeup of the Atlanta New Orleans Nashville
and Savannah breweries It seems to consist mainly of statistics about
their output and the quality of their beer Whats the chip over the
bug

If I understand your figurative language answered Colonel Telfair
it is this the article you refer to was handed to me by the owners
of the magazine with instructions to publish it The literary quality
of it did not appeal to me But in a measure I feel impelled to
conform in certain matters to the wishes of the gentlemen who are
interested in the financial side of _The Rose_

I see said Thacker Next we have two pages of selections from
Lalla Rookh by Thomas Moore Now what Federal prison did Moore
escape from or whats the name of the FFV family that he carries
as a handicap

Moore was an Irish poet who died in 1852 said Colonel Telfair
pityingly He is a classic I have been thinking of reprinting his
translation of Anacreon serially in the magazine

Look out for the copyright laws said Thacker flippantly Whos
Bessie Belleclair who contributes the essay on the newly completed
waterworks plant in Milledgeville

The name sir said Colonel Telfair is the _nom de guerre_ of
Miss Elvira Simpkins I have not the honor of knowing the lady but
her contribution was sent to us by Congressman Brower of her native
state Congressman Browers mother was related to the Polks of
Tennessee

Now see here Colonel said Thacker throwing down the magazine
this wont do You cant successfully run a magazine for one
particular section of the country Youve got to make a universal
appeal Look how the Northern publications have catered to the South
and encouraged the Southern writers And youve got to go far and
wide for your contributors Youve got to buy stuff according to its
quality without any regard to the pedigree of the author Now Ill
bet a quart of ink that this Southern parlor organ youve been running
has never played a note that originated above Mason  Hamlins line
Am I right

I have carefully and conscientiously rejected all contributions from
that section of the countryif I understand your figurative language
aright replied the colonel

All right Now Ill show you something

Thacker reached for his thick manila envelope and dumped a mass of
typewritten manuscript on the editors desk

Heres some truck said he that I paid cash for and brought along
with me

One by one he folded back the manuscripts and showed their first pages
to the colonel

Here are four short stories by four of the highest priced authors in
the United Statesthree of em living in New York and one commuting
Theres a special article on Viennabred society by Tom Vampson
Heres an Italian serial by Captain Jacknoits the other Crawford
Here are three separate exposes of city governments by Sniffings and
heres a dandy entitled What Women Carry in DressSuit Casesa
Chicago newspaper woman hired herself out for five years as a ladys
maid to get that information And heres a Synopsis of Preceding
Chapters of Hall Caines new serial to appear next June And heres a
couple of pounds of _vers de societe_ that I got at a rate from the
clever magazines Thats the stuff that people everywhere want And
now heres a writeup with photographs at the ages of four twelve
twentytwo and thirty of George B McClellan Its a prognostication
Hes bound to be elected Mayor of New York Itll make a big hit all
over the country He

I beg your pardon said Colonel Telfair stiffening in his chair
What was the name

Oh I see said Thacker with half a grin Yes hes a son of the
General Well pass that manuscript up But if youll excuse me
Colonel its a magazine were trying to make go offnot the first
gun at Fort Sumter Now heres a thing thats bound to get next to
you Its an original poem by James Whitcomb Riley J W himself
You know what that means to a magazine I wont tell you what I had
to pay for that poem but Ill tell you thisRiley can make more
money writing with a fountainpen than you or I can with one that lets
the ink run Ill read you the last two stanzas

 Pa lays around n loafs all day
 N reads and makes us leave him be
 He lets me do just like I please
 N when Im bad he laughs at me
 N when I holler loud n say
 Bad words n then begin to tease
 The cat n pa just smiles mas mad
 N gives me Jesse crost her knees
 I always wondered why that wuz
 I guess its cause
 Pa never does

 N after all the lights are out
 Im sorry bout it so I creep
 Out of my trundle bed to mas
 N say I love her a whole heap
 N kiss her n I hug her tight
 N its too dark to see her eyes
 But every time I do I know
 She cries n cries n cries n cries
 I always wondered why that wuz
 I guess its cause
 Pa never does

Thats the stuff continued Thacker What do you think of that

I am not unfamiliar with the works of Mr Riley said the colonel
deliberately I believe he lives in Indiana For the last ten years I
have been somewhat of a literary recluse and am familiar with nearly
all the books in the Cedar Heights library I am also of the opinion
that a magazine should contain a certain amount of poetry Many of the
sweetest singers of the South have already contributed to the pages of
_The Rose of Dixie_ I myself have thought of translating from the
original for publication in its pages the works of the great Italian
poet Tasso Have you ever drunk from the fountain of this immortal
poets lines Mr Thacker

Not even a demiTasso said Thacker Now lets come to the point
Colonel Telfair Ive already invested some money in this as a flyer
That bunch of manuscripts cost me 4000 My object was to try a
number of them in the next issueI believe you make up less than a
month aheadand see what effect it has on the circulation I believe
that by printing the best stuff we can get in the North South East
or West we can make the magazine go You have there the letter from
the owning company asking you to cooperate with me in the plan Lets
chuck out some of this slush that youve been publishing just because
the writers are related to the Skoopdoodles of Skoopdoodle County Are
you with me

As long as I continue to be the editor of The Rose said Colonel
Telfair with dignity I shall be its editor But I desire also to
conform to the wishes of its owners if I can do so conscientiously

Thats the talk said Thacker briskly Now how much of this stuff
Ive brought can we get into the January number We want to begin
right away

There is yet space in the January number said the editor for
about eight thousand words roughly estimated

Great said Thacker It isnt much but itll give the readers
some change from goobers governors and Gettysburg Ill leave the
selection of the stuff I brought to fill the space to you as its all
good Ive got to run back to New York and Ill be down again in a
couple of weeks

Colonel Telfair slowly swung his eyeglasses by their broad black
ribbon

The space in the January number that I referred to said he
measuredly has been held open purposely pending a decision that
I have not yet made A short time ago a contribution was submitted
to _The Rose of Dixie_ that is one of the most remarkable literary
efforts that has ever come under my observation None but a master
mind and talent could have produced it It would just fill the space
that I have reserved for its possible use

Thacker looked anxious

What kind of stuff is it he asked Eight thousand words sounds
suspicious The oldest families must have been collaborating Is there
going to be another secession

The author of the article continued the colonel ignoring Thackers
allusions is a writer of some reputation He has also distinguished
himself in other ways I do not feel at liberty to reveal to you his
nameat least not until I have decided whether or not to accept his
contribution

Well said Thacker nervously is it a continued story or an
account of the unveiling of the new town pump in Whitmire South
Carolina or a revised list of General Lees bodyservants or what

You are disposed to be facetious said Colonel Telfair calmly
The article is from the pen of a thinker a philosopher a lover of
mankind a student and a rhetorician of high degree

It must have been written by a syndicate said Thacker But
honestly Colonel you want to go slow I dont know of any
eightthousandword single doses of written matter that are read by
anybody these days except Supreme Court briefs and reports of murder
trials You havent by any accident gotten hold of a copy of one of
Daniel Websters speeches have you

Colonel Telfair swung a little in his chair and looked steadily from
under his bushy eyebrows at the magazine promoter

Mr Thacker he said gravely I am willing to segregate the
somewhat crude expression of your sense of humor from the solicitude
that your business investments undoubtedly have conferred upon you
But I must ask you to cease your jibes and derogatory comments upon
the South and the Southern people They sir will not be tolerated
in the office of _The Rose of Dixie_ for one moment And before you
proceed with more of your covert insinuations that I the editor of
this magazine am not a competent judge of the merits of the matter
submitted to its consideration I beg that you will first present some
evidence or proof that you are my superior in any way shape or form
relative to the question in hand

Oh come Colonel said Thacker goodnaturedly I didnt do
anything like that to you It sounds like an indictment by the fourth
assistant attorneygeneral Lets get back to business Whats this
8000 to 1 shot about

The article said Colonel Telfair acknowledging the apology by a
slight bow covers a wide area of knowledge It takes up theories
and questions that have puzzled the world for centuries and disposes
of them logically and concisely One by one it holds up to view the
evils of the world points out the way of eradicating them and then
conscientiously and in detail commends the good There is hardly a
phase of human life that it does not discuss wisely calmly and
equitably The great policies of governments the duties of private
citizens the obligations of home life law ethics moralityall
these important subjects are handled with a calm wisdom and confidence
that I must confess has captured my admiration

It must be a crackerjack said Thacker impressed

It is a great contribution to the worlds wisdom said the colonel
The only doubt remaining in my mind as to the tremendous advantage it
would be to us to give it publication in _The Rose of Dixie_ is that I
have not yet sufficient information about the author to give his work
publicity in our magazine

I thought you said he is a distinguished man said Thacker

He is replied the colonel both in literary and in other more
diversified and extraneous fields But I am extremely careful about
the matter that I accept for publication My contributors are people
of unquestionable repute and connections which fact can be verified
at any time As I said I am holding this article until I can acquire
more information about its author I do not know whether I will
publish it or not If I decide against it I shall be much pleased
Mr Thacker to substitute the matter that you are leaving with me in
its place

Thacker was somewhat at sea

I dont seem to gather said he much about the gist of this
inspired piece of literature It sounds more like a dark horse than
Pegasus to me

It is a human document said the coloneleditor confidently from
a man of great accomplishments who in my opinion has obtained a
stronger grasp on the world and its outcomes than that of any man
living today

Thacker rose to his feet excitedly

Say he said It isnt possible that youve cornered John D
Rockefellers memoirs is it Dont tell me that all at once

No sir said Colonel Telfair I am speaking of mentality and
literature not of the less worthy intricacies of trade

Well whats the trouble about running the article asked Thacker a
little impatiently if the mans well known and has got the stuff

Colonel Telfair sighed

Mr Thacker said he for once I have been tempted Nothing has
yet appeared in _The Rose of Dixie_ that has not been from the pen of
one of its sons or daughters I know little about the author of this
article except that he has acquired prominence in a section of the
country that has always been inimical to my heart and mind But I
recognize his genius and as I have told you I have instituted an
investigation of his personality Perhaps it will be futile But I
shall pursue the inquiry Until that is finished I must leave open
the question of filling the vacant space in our January number

Thacker arose to leave

All right Colonel he said as cordially as he could You use your
own judgment If youve really got a scoop or something that will make
em sit up run it instead of my stuff Ill drop in again in about
two weeks Good luck

Colonel Telfair and the magazine promoter shook hands

Returning a fortnight later Thacker dropped off a very rocky Pullman
at Toombs City He found the January number of the magazine made up
and the forms closed

The vacant space that had been yawning for type was filled by an
article that was headed thus


 SECOND MESSAGE TO CONGRESS

 Written for

 THE ROSE OF DIXIE

 BY

 A Member of the Wellknown

 BULLOCH FAMILY OF GEORGIA

 T Roosevelt






THE THIRD INGREDIENT


The socalled Vallambrosa ApartmentHouse is not an apartmenthouse
It is composed of two oldfashioned brownstonefront residences
welded into one The parlor floor of one side is gay with the
wraps and headgear of a modiste the other is lugubrious with the
sophistical promises and grisly display of a painless dentist You
may have a room there for two dollars a week or you may have one for
twenty dollars Among the Vallambrosas roomers are stenographers
musicians brokers shopgirls spacerate writers art students
wiretappers and other people who lean far over the banisterrail
when the doorbell rings

This treatise shall have to do with but two of the Vallambrosians
though meaning no disrespect to the others

At six oclock one afternoon Hetty Pepper came back to her thirdfloor
rear 350 room in the Vallambrosa with her nose and chin more sharply
pointed than usual To be discharged from the department store where
you have been working four years and with only fifteen cents in your
purse does have a tendency to make your features appear more finely
chiselled

And now for Hettys thumbnail biography while she climbs the two
flights of stairs

She walked into the Biggest Store one morning four years before
with seventyfive other girls applying for a job behind the waist
department counter The phalanx of wageearners formed a bewildering
scene of beauty carrying a total mass of blond hair sufficient to
have justified the horseback gallops of a hundred Lady Godivas

The capable cooleyed impersonal young baldheaded man whose task
it was to engage six of the contestants was aware of a feeling of
suffocation as if he were drowning in a sea of frangipanni while
white clouds handembroidered floated about him And then a sail
hove in sight Hetty Pepper homely of countenance with small
contemptuous green eyes and chocolatecolored hair dressed in a suit
of plain burlap and a commonsense hat stood before him with every
one of her twentynine years of life unmistakably in sight

Youre on shouted the baldheaded young man and was saved And
that is how Hetty came to be employed in the Biggest Store The story
of her rise to an eightdollaraweek salary is the combined stories
of Hercules Joan of Arc Una Job and LittleRedRidingHood You
shall not learn from me the salary that was paid her as a beginner
There is a sentiment growing about such things and I want no
millionaire storeproprietors climbing the fireescape of my
tenementhouse to throw dynamite bombs into my skylight boudoir

The story of Hettys discharge from the Biggest Store is so nearly a
repetition of her engagement as to be monotonous

In each department of the store there is an omniscient omnipresent
and omnivorous person carrying always a mileage book and a red
necktie and referred to as a buyer The destinies of the girls in
his department who live on see Bureau of Victual Statisticsso much
per week are in his hands

This particular buyer was a capable cooleyed impersonal young
baldheaded man As he walked along the aisles of his department he
seemed to be sailing on a sea of frangipanni while white clouds
machineembroidered floated around him Too many sweets bring
surfeit He looked upon Hetty Peppers homely countenance emerald
eyes and chocolatecolored hair as a welcome oasis of green in a
desert of cloying beauty In a quiet angle of a counter he pinched her
arm kindly three inches above the elbow She slapped him three feet
away with one good blow of her muscular and not especially lilywhite
right So now you know why Hetty Pepper came to leave the Biggest
Store at thirty minutes notice with one dime and a nickel in her
purse

This mornings quotations list the price of rib beef at six cents per
butchers pound But on the day that Hetty was released by the B
S the price was seven and onehalf cents That fact is what makes
this story possible Otherwise the extra four cents would have

But the plot of nearly all the good stories in the world is concerned
with shorts who were unable to cover so you can find no fault with
this one

Hetty mounted with her rib beef to her 350 thirdfloor back One
hot savory beefstew for supper a nights good sleep and she would
be fit in the morning to apply again for the tasks of Hercules Joan
of Arc Una Job and LittleRedRidingHood

In her room she got the graniteware stewpan out of the 2x4foot
chinaerI mean earthenware closet and began to dig down in a
ratsnest of paper bags for the potatoes and onions She came out
with her nose and chin just a little sharper pointed

There was neither a potato nor an onion Now what kind of a beefstew
can you make out of simply beef You can make oystersoup without
oysters turtlesoup without turtles coffeecake without coffee but
you cant make beefstew without potatoes and onions

But rib beef alone in an emergency can make an ordinary pine door
look like a wroughtiron gamblinghouse portal to the wolf With salt
and pepper and a tablespoonful of flour first well stirred in a
little cold water twill servetis not so deep as a lobster a la
Newburg nor so wide as a church festival doughnut but twill serve

Hetty took her stewpan to the rear of the thirdfloor hall According
to the advertisements of the Vallambrosa there was running water to be
found there Between you and me and the watermeter it only ambled
or walked through the faucets but technicalities have no place here
There was also a sink where housekeeping roomers often met to dump
their coffee grounds and glare at one anothers kimonos

At this sink Hetty found a girl with heavy goldbrown artistic hair
and plaintive eyes washing two large Irish potatoes Hetty knew the
Vallambrosa as well as any one not owning double hextramagnifying
eyes could compass its mysteries The kimonos were her encyclopedia
her Whos What her clearinghouse of news of goers and comers From
a rosepink kimono edged with Nile green she had learned that the
girl with the potatoes was a miniaturepainter living in a kind of
atticor studio as they prefer to call iton the top floor Hetty
was not certain in her mind what a miniature was but it certainly
wasnt a house because housepainters although they wear splashy
overalls and poke ladders in your face on the street are known to
indulge in a riotous profusion of food at home

The potato girl was quite slim and small and handled her potatoes as
an old bachelor uncle handles a baby who is cutting teeth She had a
dull shoemakers knife in her right hand and she had begun to peel
one of the potatoes with it

Hetty addressed her in the punctiliously formal tone of one who
intends to be cheerfully familiar with you in the second round

Beg pardon she said for butting into whats not my business but
if you peel them potatoes you lose out Theyre new Bermudas You want
to scrape em Lemme show you

She took a potato and the knife and began to demonstrate

Oh thank you breathed the artist I didnt know And I _did_ hate
to see the thick peeling go it seemed such a waste But I thought
they always had to be peeled When youve got only potatoes to eat
the peelings count you know

Say kid said Hetty staying her knife you aint up against it
too are you

The miniature artist smiled starvedly

I suppose I am Artor at least the way I interpret itdoesnt
seem to be much in demand I have only these potatoes for my dinner
But they arent so bad boiled and hot with a little butter and salt

Child said Hetty letting a brief smile soften her rigid features
Fate has sent me and you together Ive had it handed to me in the
neck too but Ive got a chunk of meat in my room as big as a
lapdog And Ive done everything to get potatoes except pray for em
Lets me and you bunch our commissary departments and make a stew of
em Well cook it in my room If we only had an onion to go in it
Say kid you havent got a couple of pennies thatve slipped down
into the lining of your last winters sealskin have you I could step
down to the corner and get one at old Giuseppes stand A stew without
an onion is worsen a matinee without candy

You may call me Cecilia said the artist No I spent my last penny
three days ago

Then well have to cut the onion out instead of slicing it in said
Hetty Id ask the janitress for one but I dont want em hep just
yet to the fact that Im pounding the asphalt for another job But I
wish we did have an onion

In the shopgirls room the two began to prepare their supper
Cecilias part was to sit on the couch helplessly and beg to be
allowed to do something in the voice of a cooing ringdove Hetty
prepared the rib beef putting it in cold salted water in the stewpan
and setting it on the oneburner gasstove

I wish we had an onion said Hetty as she scraped the two potatoes

On the wall opposite the couch was pinned a flaming gorgeous
advertising picture of one of the new ferryboats of the P U F F
Railroad that had been built to cut down the time between Los Angeles
and New York City oneeighth of a minute

Hetty turning her head during her continuous monologue saw
tears running from her guests eyes as she gazed on the idealized
presentment of the speeding foamgirdled transport

Why say Cecilia kid said Hetty poising her knife is it as bad
art as that I aint a critic but I thought it kind of brightened
up the room Of course a manicurepainter could tell it was a bum
picture in a minute Ill take it down if you say so I wish to the
holy Saint Potluck we had an onion

But the miniature miniaturepainter had tumbled down sobbing with
her nose indenting the hardwoven drapery of the couch Something
was here deeper than the artistic temperament offended at crude
lithography

Hetty knew She had accepted her role long ago How scant the words
with which we try to describe a single quality of a human being When
we reach the abstract we are lost The nearer to Nature that the
babbling of our lips comes the better do we understand Figuratively
let us say some people are Bosoms some are Hands some are Heads
some are Muscles some are Feet some are Backs for burdens

Hetty was a Shoulder Hers was a sharp sinewy shoulder but all her
life people had laid their heads upon it metaphorically or actually
and had left there all or half their troubles Looking at Life
anatomically which is as good a way as any she was preordained to
be a Shoulder There were few truer collarbones anywhere than hers

Hetty was only thirtythree and she had not yet outlived the little
pang that visited her whenever the head of youth and beauty leaned
upon her for consolation But one glance in her mirror always served
as an instantaneous painkiller So she gave one pale look into the
crinkly old lookingglass on the wall above the gasstove turned down
the flame a little lower from the bubbling beef and potatoes went
over to the couch and lifted Cecilias head to its confessional

Go on and tell me honey she said I know now that it aint art
thats worrying you You met him on a ferryboat didnt you Go on
Cecilia kid and tell youryour Aunt Hetty about it

But youth and melancholy must first spend the surplus of sighs and
tears that waft and float the barque of romance to its harbor in the
delectable isles Presently through the stringy tendons that formed
the bars of the confessional the penitentor was it the glorified
communicant of the sacred flametold her story without art or
illumination

It was only three days ago I was coming back on the ferry from
Jersey City Old Mr Schrum an art dealer told me of a rich man in
Newark who wanted a miniature of his daughter painted I went to see
him and showed him some of my work When I told him the price would
be fifty dollars he laughed at me like a hyena He said an enlarged
crayon twenty times the size would cost him only eight dollars

I had just enough money to buy my ferry ticket back to New York I
felt as if I didnt want to live another day I must have looked as I
felt for I saw _him_ on the row of seats opposite me looking at me
as if he understood He was nicelooking but oh above everything
else he looked kind When one is tired or unhappy or hopeless
kindness counts more than anything else

When I got so miserable that I couldnt fight against it any longer
I got up and walked slowly out the rear door of the ferryboat cabin
No one was there and I slipped quickly over the rail and dropped into
the water Oh friend Hetty it was cold cold

For just one moment I wished I was back in the old Vallambrosa
starving and hoping And then I got numb and didnt care And then I
felt that somebody else was in the water close by me holding me up
_He_ had followed me and jumped in to save me

Somebody threw a thing like a big white doughnut at us and he made
me put my arms through the hole Then the ferryboat backed and they
pulled us on board Oh Hetty I was so ashamed of my wickedness in
trying to drown myself and besides my hair had all tumbled down and
was sopping wet and I was such a sight

And then some men in blue clothes came around and he gave them his
card and I heard him tell them he had seen me drop my purse on the
edge of the boat outside the rail and in leaning over to get it I had
fallen overboard And then I remembered having read in the papers that
people who try to kill themselves are locked up in cells with people
who try to kill other people and I was afraid

But some ladies on the boat took me downstairs to the furnaceroom
and got me nearly dry and did up my hair When the boat landed _he_
came and put me in a cab He was all dripping himself but laughed as
if he thought it was all a joke He begged me but I wouldnt tell him
my name nor where I lived I was so ashamed

You were a fool child said Hetty kindly Wait till I turn the
light up a bit I wish to Heaven we had an onion

Then he raised his hat went on Cecilia and said Very well But
Ill find you anyhow Im going to claim my rights of salvage Then
he gave money to the cabdriver and told him to take me where I wanted
to go and walked away What is salvage Hetty

The edge of a piece of goods that aint hemmed said the shopgirl
You must have looked pretty well frazzled out to the little hero
boy

Its been three days moaned the miniaturepainter and he hasnt
found me yet

Extend the time said Hetty This is a big town Think of how many
girls he might have to see soaked in water with their hair down before
he would recognize you The stews getting on finebut oh for an
onion Id even use a piece of garlic if I had it

The beef and potatoes bubbled merrily exhaling a mouthwatering savor
that yet lacked something leaving a hunger on the palate a haunting
wistful desire for some lost and needful ingredient

I came near drowning in that awful river said Cecilia shuddering

It ought to have more water in it said Hetty the stew I mean
Ill go get some at the sink

It smells good said the artist

That nasty old North River objected Hetty It smells to me like
soap factories and wet setterdogsoh you mean the stew Well I
wish we had an onion for it Did he look like he had money

First he looked kind said Cecilia Im sure he was rich but that
matters so little When he drew out his billfolder to pay the cabman
you couldnt help seeing hundreds and thousands of dollars in it And
I looked over the cab doors and saw him leave the ferry station in a
motorcar and the chauffeur gave him his bearskin to put on for he
was sopping wet And it was only three days ago

What a fool said Hetty shortly

Oh the chauffeur wasnt wet breathed Cecilia And he drove the
car away very nicely

I mean _you_ said Hetty For not giving him your address

I never give my address to chauffeurs said Cecilia haughtily

I wish we had one said Hetty disconsolately

What for

For the stew of courseoh I mean an onion

Hetty took a pitcher and started to the sink at the end of the hall

A young man came down the stairs from above just as she was opposite
the lower step He was decently dressed but pale and haggard His
eyes were dull with the stress of some burden of physical or mental
woe In his hand he bore an oniona pink smooth solid shining
onion as large around as a ninetyeightcent alarmclock

Hetty stopped So did the young man There was something
Joan of Arcish Herculean and Unaish in the look and pose
of the shopladyshe had cast off the roles of Job and
LittleRedRidingHood The young man stopped at the foot of the
stairs and coughed distractedly He felt marooned held up attacked
assailed levied upon sacked assessed panhandled browbeaten
though he knew not why It was the look in Hettys eyes that did it
In them he saw the Jolly Roger fly to the masthead and an able seaman
with a dirk between his teeth scurry up the ratlines and nail it
there But as yet he did not know that the cargo he carried was the
thing that had caused him to be so nearly blown out of the water
without even a parley

_Beg_ your pardon said Hetty as sweetly as her dilute acetic acid
tones permitted but did you find that onion on the stairs There was
a hole in the paper bag and Ive just come out to look for it

The young man coughed for half a minute The interval may have given
him the courage to defend his own property Also he clutched his
pungent prize greedily and with a show of spirit faced his grim
waylayer

No he said huskily I didnt find it on the stairs It was given
to me by Jack Bevens on the top floor If you dont believe it ask
him Ill wait until you do

I know about Bevens said Hetty sourly He writes books and things
up there for the paperandrags man We can hear the postman guy him
all over the house when he brings them thick envelopes back Saydo
you live in the Vallambrosa

I do not said the young man I come to see Bevens sometimes Hes
my friend I live two blocks west

What are you going to do with the onion_begging_ your pardon
said Hetty

Im going to eat it

Raw

Yes as soon as I get home

Havent you got anything else to eat with it

The young man considered briefly

No he confessed theres not another scrap of anything in my
diggings to eat I think old Jack is pretty hard up for grub in his
shack too He hated to give up the onion but I worried him into
parting with it

Man said Hetty fixing him with her worldsapient eyes and laying
a bony but impressive finger on his sleeve youve known trouble too
havent you

Lots said the onion owner promptly But this onion is my own
property honestly come by If you will excuse me I must be going

Listen said Hetty paling a little with anxiety Raw onion is a
mighty poor diet And so is a beefstew without one Now if youre Jack
Bevens friend I guess youre nearly right Theres a little ladya
friend of minein my room there at the end of the hall Both of us
are out of luck and we had just potatoes and meat between us Theyre
stewing now But it aint got any soul Theres something lacking to it
Theres certain things in life that are naturally intended to fit and
belong together One is pink cheesecloth and green roses and one is
ham and eggs and one is Irish and trouble And the other one is beef
and potatoes _with_ onions And still another one is people who are up
against it and other people in the same fix

The young man went into a protracted paroxysm of coughing With one
hand he hugged his onion to his bosom

No doubt no doubt said he at length But as I said I must be
going because

Hetty clutched his sleeve firmly

Dont be a Dago Little Brother Dont eat raw onions Chip it in
toward the dinner and line yourself inside with the best stew you ever
licked a spoon over Must two ladies knock a young gentleman down and
drag him inside for the honor of dining with em No harm shall befall
you Little Brother Loosen up and fall into line

The young mans pale face relaxed into a grin

Believe Ill go you he said brightening If my onion is good as
a credential Ill accept the invitation gladly

Its good as that but better as seasoning said Hetty You come
and stand outside the door till I ask my lady friend if she has any
objections And dont run away with that letter of recommendation
before I come out

Hetty went into her room and closed the door The young man waited
outside

Cecilia kid said the shopgirl oiling the sharp saw of her voice
as well as she could theres an onion outside With a young man
attached Ive asked him in to dinner You aint going to kick are
you

Oh dear said Cecilia sitting up and patting her artistic hair She
cast a mournful glance at the ferryboat poster on the wall

Nit said Hetty It aint him Youre up against real life now I
believe you said your hero friend had money and automobiles This is
a poor skeezicks thats got nothing to eat but an onion But hes
easyspoken and not a freshy I imagine hes been a gentleman hes
so low down now And we need the onion Shall I bring him in Ill
guarantee his behavior

Hetty dear sighed Cecilia Im so hungry What difference does it
make whether hes a prince or a burglar I dont care Bring him in if
hes got anything to eat with him

Hetty went back into the hall The onion man was gone Her heart missed
a beat and a gray look settled over her face except on her nose and
cheekbones And then the tides of life flowed in again for she saw
him leaning out of the front window at the other end of the hall She
hurried there He was shouting to some one below The noise of the
street overpowered the sound of her footsteps She looked down over his
shoulder saw whom he was speaking to and heard his words He pulled
himself in from the windowsill and saw her standing over him

Hettys eyes bored into him like two steel gimlets

Dont lie to me she said calmly What were you going to do with
that onion

The young man suppressed a cough and faced her resolutely His manner
was that of one who had been bearded sufficiently

I was going to eat it said he with emphatic slowness just as I
told you before

And you have nothing else to eat at home

Not a thing

What kind of work do you do

I am not working at anything just now

Then why said Hetty with her voice set on its sharpest edge do you
lean out of windows and give orders to chauffeurs in green automobiles
in the street below

The young man flushed and his dull eyes began to sparkle

Because madam said he in _accelerando_ tones I pay the
chauffeurs wages and I own the automobileand also this onionthis
onion madam

He flourished the onion within an inch of Hettys nose The shoplady
did not retreat a hairsbreadth

Then why do you eat onions she said with biting contempt and
nothing else

I never said I did retorted the young man heatedly I said I had
nothing else to eat where I live I am not a delicatessen storekeeper

Then why pursued Hetty inflexibly were you going to eat a raw
onion

My mother said the young man always made me eat one for a cold
Pardon my referring to a physical infirmity but you may have noticed
that I have a very very severe cold I was going to eat the onion and
go to bed I wonder why I am standing here and apologizing to you for
it

How did you catch this cold went on Hetty suspiciously

The young man seemed to have arrived at some extreme height of feeling
There were two modes of descent open to hima burst of rage or a
surrender to the ridiculous He chose wisely and the empty hall echoed
his hoarse laughter

Youre a dandy said he And I dont blame you for being careful I
dont mind telling you I got wet I was on a North River ferry a few
days ago when a girl jumped overboard Of course I

Hetty extended her hand interrupting his story

Give me the onion she said

The young man set his jaw a trifle harder

Give me the onion she repeated

He grinned and laid it in her hand

Then Hettys infrequent grim melancholy smile showed itself She took
the young mans arm and pointed with her other hand to the door of her
room

Little Brother she said go in there The little fool you fished out
of the river is there waiting for you Go on in Ill give you three
minutes before I come Potatoes is in there waiting Go on in Onions

After he had tapped at the door and entered Hetty began to peel and
wash the onion at the sink She gave a gray look at the gray roofs
outside and the smile on her face vanished by little jerks and
twitches

But its us she said grimly to herself its _us_ that furnished
the beef




THE HIDING OF BLACK BILL


A lank strong redfaced man with a Wellington beak and small fiery
eyes tempered by flaxen lashes sat on the station platform at Los
Pinos swinging his legs to and fro At his side sat another man fat
melancholy and seedy who seemed to be his friend They had the
appearance of men to whom life had appeared as a reversible coatseamy
on both sides

Aint seen you in about four years Ham said the seedy man Which
way you been travelling

Texas said the redfaced man It was too cold in Alaska for me
And I found it warm in Texas Ill tell you about one hot spell I went
through there

One morning I steps off the International at a watertank and lets it
go on without me Twas a ranch country and fuller of spitehouses than
New York City Only out there they build em twenty miles away so you
cant smell what theyve got for dinner instead of running em up two
inches from their neighbors windows

There wasnt any roads in sight so I footed it cross country The
grass was shoetop deep and the mesquite timber looked just like a
peach orchard It was so much like a gentlemans private estate that
every minute you expected a kennelful of bulldogs to run out and bite
you But I must have walked twenty miles before I came in sight of a
ranchhouse It was a little one about as big as an elevatedrailroad
station

There was a little man in a white shirt and brown overalls and a pink
handkerchief around his neck rolling cigarettes under a tree in front
of the door

Greetings says I Any refreshment welcome emoluments or even
work for a comparative stranger

Oh come in says he in a refined tone Sit down on that stool
please I didnt hear your horse coming

He isnt near enough yet says I I walked I dont want to be
a burden but I wonder if you have three or four gallons of water
handy

You do look pretty dusty says he but our bathing arrangements

Its a drink I want says I Never mind the dust thats on the
outside

He gets me a dipper of water out of a red jar hanging up and then
goes on

Do you want work

For a time says I This is a rather quiet section of the country
isnt it

It is says he Sometimesso I have been toldone sees no human
being pass for weeks at a time Ive been here only a month I bought
the ranch from an old settler who wanted to move farther west

It suits me says I Quiet and retirement are good for a man
sometimes And I need a job I can tend bar salt mines lecture float
stock do a little middleweight slugging and play the piano

Can you herd sheep asks the little ranchman

Do you mean _have_ I heard sheep says I

Can you herd emtake charge of a flock of em says he

Oh says I now I understand You mean chase em around and bark at
em like collie dogs Well I might says I Ive never exactly done
any sheepherding but Ive often seen em from car windows masticating
daisies and they dont look dangerous

Im short a herder says the ranchman You never can depend on
the Mexicans Ive only got two flocks You may take out my bunch of
muttonsthere are only eight hundred of emin the morning if you
like The pay is twelve dollars a month and your rations furnished You
camp in a tent on the prairie with your sheep You do your own cooking
but wood and water are brought to your camp Its an easy job

Im on says I Ill take the job even if I have to garland my brow
and hold on to a crook and wear a looseeffect and play on a pipe like
the shepherds do in pictures

So the next morning the little ranchman helps me drive the flock of
muttons from the corral to about two miles out and let em graze on a
little hillside on the prairie He gives me a lot of instructions about
not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd and driving em
down to a waterhole to drink at noon

Ill bring out your tent and camping outfit and rations in the
buckboard before night says he

Fine says I And dont forget the rations Nor the camping outfit
And be sure to bring the tent Your names Zollicoffer aint it

My name says he is Henry Ogden

All right Mr Ogden says I Mine is Mr Percival Saint Clair

I herded sheep for five days on the Rancho Chiquito and then the wool
entered my soul That getting next to Nature certainly got next to me
I was lonesomer than Crusoes goat Ive seen a lot of persons more
entertaining as companions than those sheep were Id drive em to the
corral and pen em every evening and then cook my cornbread and mutton
and coffee and lie down in a tent the size of a tablecloth and listen
to the coyotes and whippoorwills singing around the camp

The fifth evening after I had corralled my costly but uncongenial
muttons I walked over to the ranchhouse and stepped in the door

Mr Ogden says I you and me have got to get sociable Sheep are
all very well to dot the landscape and furnish eightdollar cotton
suitings for man but for tabletalk and fireside companions they rank
along with fiveoclock teazers If youve got a deck of cards or a
parcheesi outfit or a game of authors get em out and lets get on a
mental basis Ive got to do something in an intellectual line if its
only to knock somebodys brains out

This Henry Ogden was a peculiar kind of ranchman He wore fingerrings
and a big gold watch and careful neckties And his face was calm and
his nosespectacles was kept very shiny I saw once in Muscogee an
outlaw hung for murdering six men who was a dead ringer for him But I
knew a preacher in Arkansas that you would have taken to be his brother
I didnt care much for him either way what I wanted was some fellowship
and communion with holy saints or lost sinnersanything sheepless would
do

Well Saint Clair says he laying down the book he was reading I
guess it must be pretty lonesome for you at first And I dont deny that
its monotonous for me Are you sure you corralled your sheep so they
wont stray out

Theyre shut up as tight as the jury of a millionaire murderer says
I And Ill be back with them long before theyll need their trained
nurse

So Ogden digs up a deck of cards and we play casino After five
days and nights of my sheepcamp it was like a toot on Broadway When
I caught big casino I felt as excited as if I had made a million in
Trinity And when H O loosened up a little and told the story about
the lady in the Pullman car I laughed for five minutes

That showed what a comparative thing life is A man may see so much
that hed be bored to turn his head to look at a 3000000 fire or
Joe Weber or the Adriatic Sea But let him herd sheep for a spell and
youll see him splitting his ribs laughing at Curfew Shall Not Ring
Tonight or really enjoying himself playing cards with ladies

Byandby Ogden gets out a decanter of Bourbon and then there is a
total eclipse of sheep

Do you remember reading in the papers about a month ago says he
about a train holdup on the M K  T The express agent was shot
through the shoulder and about 15000 in currency taken And its said
that only one man did the job

Seems to me I do says I But such things happen so often they dont
linger long in the human Texas mind Did they overtake overhaul seize
or lay hands upon the despoiler

He escaped says Ogden And I was just reading in a paper today
that the officers have tracked him down into this part of the country
It seems the bills the robber got were all the first issue of currency
to the Second National Bank of Espinosa City And so theyve followed
the trail where theyve been spent and it leads this way

Ogden pours out some more Bourbon and shoves me the bottle

I imagine says I after ingurgitating another modicum of the royal
booze that it wouldnt be at all a disingenuous idea for a train
robber to run down into this part of the country to hide for a spell A
sheepranch now says I would be the finest kind of a place Whod
ever expect to find such a desperate character among these songbirds
and muttons and wild flowers And by the way says I kind of
looking H Ogden over was there any description mentioned of this
singlehanded terror Was his lineaments or height and thickness or
teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print

Why no says Ogden they say nobody got a good sight of him because
he wore a mask But they know it was a trainrobber called Black Bill
because he always works alone and because he dropped a handkerchief in
the expresscar that had his name on it

All right says I I approve of Black Bills retreat to the
sheepranges I guess they wont find him

Theres one thousand dollars reward for his capture says Ogden

I dont need that kind of money says I looking Mr Sheepman
straight in the eye The twelve dollars a month you pay me is enough
I need a rest and I can save up until I get enough to pay my fare to
Texarkana where my widowed mother lives If Black Bill I goes on
looking significantly at Ogden was to have come down this waysay
a month agoand bought a little sheepranch and

Stop says Ogden getting out of his chair and looking pretty
vicious Do you mean to insinuate

Nothing says I no insinuations Im stating a hypodermical case
I say if Black Bill had come down here and bought a sheepranch and
hired me to LittleBoyBlue em and treated me square and friendly as
youve done hed never have anything to fear from me A man is a man
regardless of any complications he may have with sheep or railroad
trains Now you know where I stand

Ogden looks black as campcoffee for nine seconds and then he laughs
amused

Youll do Saint Clair says he If I _was_ Black Bill I wouldnt
be afraid to trust you Lets have a game or two of sevenup tonight
That is if you dont mind playing with a trainrobber

Ive told you says I my oral sentiments and theres no strings
to em

While I was shuffling after the first hand I asks Ogden as if the
idea was a kind of a casualty where he was from

Oh says he from the Mississippi Valley

Thats a nice little place says I Ive often stopped over there
But didnt you find the sheets a little damp and the food poor Now I
hail says I from the Pacific Slope Ever put up there

Too draughty says Ogden But if youre ever in the Middle West just
mention my name and youll get footwarmers and dripped coffee

Well says I I wasnt exactly fishing for your private telephone
number and the middle name of your aunt that carried off the Cumberland
Presbyterian minister It dont matter I just want you to know you are
safe in the hands of your shepherd Now dont play hearts on spades
and dont get nervous

Still harping says Ogden laughing again Dont you suppose that
if I was Black Bill and thought you suspected me Id put a Winchester
bullet into you and stop my nervousness if I had any

Not any says I A man whos got the nerve to hold up a train
singlehanded wouldnt do a trick like that Ive knocked about enough
to know that them are the kind of men who put a value on a friend Not
that I can claim being a friend of yours Mr Ogden says I being
only your sheepherder but under more expeditious circumstances we
might have been

Forget the sheep temporarily I beg says Ogden and cut for deal

About four days afterward while my muttons was nooning on the
waterhole and I deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee up
rides softly on the grass a mysterious person in the garb of the being
he wished to represent He was dressed somewhere between a Kansas City
detective Buffalo Bill and the town dogcatcher of Baton Rouge His
chin and eye wasnt molded on fighting lines so I knew he was only a
scout

Herdin sheep he asks me

Well says I to a man of your evident gumptional endowments I
wouldnt have the nerve to state that I am engaged in decorating old
bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets

You dont talk or look like a sheepherder to me says he

But you talk like what you look like to me says I

And then he asks me who I was working for and I shows him Rancho
Chiquito two miles away in the shadow of a low hill and he tells
me hes a deputy sheriff

Theres a trainrobber called Black Bill supposed to be somewhere in
these parts says the scout Hes been traced as far as San Antonio
and maybe farther Have you seen or heard of any strangers around here
during the past month

I have not says I except a report of one over at the Mexican
quarters of Loomis ranch on the Frio

What do you know about him asks the deputy

Hes three days old says I

What kind of a looking man is the man you work for he asks Does
old George Ramey own this place yet Hes run sheep here for the last
ten years but never had no success

The old man has sold out and gone West I tells him Another
sheepfancier bought him out about a month ago

What kind of a looking man is he asks the deputy again

Oh says I a big fat kind of a Dutchman with long whiskers and
blue specs I dont think he knows a sheep from a groundsquirrel I
guess old George soaked him pretty well on the deal says I

After indulging himself in a lot more noncommunicative information
and twothirds of my dinner the deputy rides away

That night I mentions the matter to Ogden

Theyre drawing the tendrils of the octopus around Black Bill says
I And then I told him about the deputy sheriff and how Id described
him to the deputy and what the deputy said about the matter

Oh well says Ogden lets dont borrow any of Black Bills
troubles Weve a few of our own Get the Bourbon out of the cupboard
and well drink to his healthunless says he with his little
cackling laugh youre prejudiced against trainrobbers

Ill drink says I to any man whos a friend to a friend And I
believe that Black Bill I goes on would be that So heres to Black
Bill and may he have good luck

And both of us drank

About two weeks later comes shearingtime The sheep had to be driven
up to the ranch and a lot of frowzyheaded Mexicans would snip the
fur off of them with backaction scissors So the afternoon before the
barbers were to come I hustled my underdone muttons over the hill
across the dell down by the winding brook and up to the ranchhouse
where I penned em in a corral and bade em my nightly adieus

I went from there to the ranchhouse I find H Ogden Esquire
lying asleep on his little cot bed I guess he had been overcome by
antiinsomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to the
sheep business His mouth and vest were open and he breathed like a
secondhand bicycle pump I looked at him and gave vent to just a few
musings Imperial Caesar says I asleep in such a way might shut
his mouth and keep the wind away

A man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep What good is all
his brain muscle backing nerve influence and family connections
Hes at the mercy of his enemies and more so of his friends And hes
about as beautiful as a cabhorse leaning against the Metropolitan Opera
House at 1230 AM dreaming of the plains of Arabia Now a woman
asleep you regard as different No matter how she looks you know its
better for all hands for her to be that way

Well I took a drink of Bourbon and one for Ogden and started in to
be comfortable while he was taking his nap He had some books on his
table on indigenous subjects such as Japan and drainage and physical
cultureand some tobacco which seemed more to the point

After Id smoked a few and listened to the sartorial breathing of H
O I happened to look out the window toward the shearingpens where
there was a kind of a road coming up from a kind of a road across a
kind of a creek farther away

I saw five men riding up to the house All of em carried guns across
their saddles and among em was the deputy that had talked to me at my
camp

They rode up careful in open formation with their guns ready I set
apart with my eye the one I opinionated to be the boss muckraker of
this lawandorder cavalry

Goodevening gents says I Wont you light and tie your horses

The boss rides up close and swings his gun over till the opening in
it seems to cover my whole front elevation

Dont you move your hands none says he till you and me indulge in
a adequate amount of necessary conversation

I will not says I I am no deafmute and therefore will not have
to disobey your injunctions in replying

We are on the lookout says he for Black Bill the man that held up
the Katy for 15000 in May We are searching the ranches and everybody
on em What is your name and what do you do on this ranch

Captain says I Percival Saint Clair is my occupation and my name
is sheepherder Ive got my flock of vealsno muttonspenned here
tonight The shearers are coming tomorrow to give them a haircutwith
baaarum I suppose

Wheres the boss of this ranch the captain of the gang asks me

Wait just a minute capn says I Wasnt there a kind of a reward
offered for the capture of this desperate character you have referred
to in your preamble

Theres a thousand dollars reward offered says the captain but
its for his capture and conviction There dont seem to be no provision
made for an informer

It looks like it might rain in a day or so says I in a tired way
looking up at the cerulean blue sky

If you know anything about the locality disposition or secretiveness
of this here Black Bill says he in a severe dialect you are amiable
to the law in not reporting it

I heard a fencerider say says I in a desultory kind of voice
that a Mexican told a cowboy named Jake over at Pidgins store on the
Nueces that he heard that Black Bill had been seen in Matamoras by a
sheepmans cousin two weeks ago

Tell you what Ill do Tight Mouth says the captain after looking
me over for bargains If you put us on so we can scoop Black Bill Ill
pay you a hundred dollars out of my ownout of our ownpockets Thats
liberal says he You aint entitled to anything Now what do you
say

Cash down now I asks

The captain has a sort of discussion with his helpmates and they all
produce the contents of their pockets for analysis Out of the general
results they figured up 10230 in cash and 31 worth of plug tobacco

Come nearer capitan meeo says I and listen He so did

I am mighty poor and low down in the world says I I am working for
twelve dollars a month trying to keep a lot of animals together whose
only thought seems to be to get asunder Although says I I regard
myself as some better than the State of South Dakota its a comedown
to a man who has heretofore regarded sheep only in the form of chops
Im pretty far reduced in the world on account of foiled ambitions and
rum and a kind of cocktail they make along the P R R all the way from
Scranton to Cincinnatidry gin French vermouth one squeeze of a lime
and a good dash of orange bitters If youre ever up that way dont
fail to let one try you And again says I I have never yet went
back on a friend Ive stayed by em when they had plenty and when
adversitys overtaken me Ive never forsook em

But I goes on this is not exactly the case of a friend Twelve
dollars a month is only bowingacquaintance money And I do not consider
brown beans and cornbread the food of friendship I am a poor man
says I and I have a widowed mother in Texarkana You will find Black
Bill says I lying asleep in this house on a cot in the room to your
right Hes the man you want as I know from his words and conversation
He was in a way a friend I explains and if I was the man I once was
the entire product of the mines of Gondola would not have tempted me to
betray him But says I every week half of the beans was wormy and
not nigh enough wood in camp

Better go in careful gentlemen says I He seems impatient at
times and when you think of his late professional pursuits one would
look for abrupt actions if he was come upon sudden

So the whole posse unmounts and ties their horses and unlimbers their
ammunition and equipments and tiptoes into the house And I follows
like Delilah when she set the Philip Steins on to Samson

The leader of the posse shakes Ogden and wakes him up And then he
jumps up and two more of the rewardhunters grab him Ogden was mighty
tough with all his slimness and he gives em as neat a singlefooted
tussle against odds as I ever see

What does this mean he says after they had him down

Youre scooped in Mr Black Bill says the captain Thats all

Its an outrage says H Ogden madder yet

It was says the peaceandgoodwill man The Katy wasnt bothering
you and theres a law against monkeying with express packages

And he sits on H Ogdens stomach and goes through his pockets
symptomatically and careful

Ill make you perspire for this says Ogden perspiring some himself
I can prove who I am

So can I says the captain as he draws from H Ogdens inside
coatpocket a handful of new bills of the Second National Bank
of Espinosa City Your regular engraved TuesdaysandFridays
visitingcard wouldnt have a louder voice in proclaiming your indemnity
than this here currency You can get up now and prepare to go with us
and expatriate your sins

H Ogden gets up and fixes his necktie He says no more after they
have taken the money off of him

A wellgreased idea says the sheriff captain admiring to slip off
down here and buy a little sheepranch where the hand of man is seldom
heard It was the slickest hideout I ever see says the captain

So one of the men goes to the shearingpen and hunts up the other
herder a Mexican they call John Sallies and he saddles Ogdens horse
and the sheriffs all ride up close around him with their guns in hand
ready to take their prisoner to town

Before starting Ogden puts the ranch in John Sallies hands and gives
him orders about the shearing and where to graze the sheep just as if
he intended to be back in a few days And a couple of hours afterward
one Percival Saint Clair an exsheepherder of the Rancho Chiquito
might have been seen with a hundred and nine dollarswages and
bloodmoneyin his pocket riding south on another horse belonging to
said ranch

The redfaced man paused and listened The whistle of a coming
freighttrain sounded far away among the low hills

The fat seedy man at his side sniffed and shook his frowzy head slowly
and disparagingly

What is it Snipy asked the other Got the blues again

No I aint said the seedy one sniffing again But I dont like your
talk You and me have been friends off and on for fifteen year and I
never yet knew or heard of you giving anybody up to the lawnot no one
And here was a man whose saleratus you had et and at whose table you had
played games of cardsif casino can be so called And yet you inform
him to the law and take money for it It never was like you I say

This H Ogden resumed the redfaced man through a lawyer proved
himself free by alibis and other legal terminalities as I so heard
afterward He never suffered no harm He did me favors and I hated to
hand him over

How about the bills they found in his pocket asked the seedy man

I put em there said the redfaced man while he was asleep when I
saw the posse riding up I was Black Bill Look out Snipy here she
comes Well board her on the bumpers when she takes water at the tank

Old Jerome Warren lived in a hundredthousanddollar house at 35 East
FiftySoforth Street He was a downtown broker so rich that he could
afford to walkfor his healtha few blocks in the direction of his
office every morning and then call a cab

He had an adopted son the son of an old friend named GilbertCyril
Scott could play him nicelywho was becoming a successful painter as
fast as he could squeeze the paint out of his tubes Another member of
the household was Barbara Ross a stepniece Man is born to trouble
so as old Jerome had no family of his own he took up the burdens of
others

Gilbert and Barbara got along swimmingly There was a tacit and tactical
understanding all round that the two would stand up under a floral bell
some high noon and promise the minister to keep old Jeromes money
in a state of high commotion But at this point complications must be
introduced

Thirty years before when old Jerome was young Jerome there was a
brother of his named Dick Dick went West to seek his or somebody elses
fortune Nothing was heard of him until one day old Jerome had a letter
from his brother It was badly written on ruled paper that smelled
of salt bacon and coffeegrounds The writing was asthmatic and the
spelling St Vitusy

It appeared that instead of Dick having forced Fortune to stand and
deliver he had been held up himself and made to give hostages to the
enemy That is as his letter disclosed he was on the point of pegging
out with a complication of disorders that even whiskey had failed to
check All that his thirty years of prospecting had netted him was one
daughter nineteen years old as per invoice whom he was shipping East
charges prepaid for Jerome to clothe feed educate comfort and
cherish for the rest of her natural life or until matrimony should them
part

Old Jerome was a boardwalk Everybody knows that the world is supported
by the shoulders of Atlas and that Atlas stands on a railfence and
that the railfence is built on a turtles back Now the turtle has
to stand on something and that is a boardwalk made of men like old
Jerome

I do not know whether immortality shall accrue to man but if not so
I would like to know when men like old Jerome get what is due them

They met Nevada Warren at the station She was a little girl deeply
sunburned and wholesomely goodlooking with a manner that was frankly
unsophisticated yet one that not even a cigardrummer would intrude
upon without thinking twice Looking at her somehow you would expect
to see her in a short skirt and leather leggings shooting glass balls
or taming mustangs But in her plain white waist and black skirt she
sent you guessing again With an easy exhibition of strength she swung
along a heavy valise which the uniformed porters tried in vain to wrest
from her

I am sure we shall be the best of friends said Barbara pecking at
the firm sunburned cheek

I hope so said Nevada

Dear little niece said old Jerome you are as welcome to my home as
if it were your fathers own

Thanks said Nevada

And I am going to call you cousin said Gilbert with his charming
smile

Take the valise please said Nevada It weighs a million pounds
Its got samples from six of dads old mines in it she explained to
Barbara I calculate theyd assay about nine cents to the thousand
tons but I promised him to bring them along

It is a common custom to refer to the usual complication between one
man and two ladies or one lady and two men or a lady and a man and
a nobleman orwell any of those problemsas the triangle But
they are never unqualified triangles They are always isoscelesnever
equilateral So upon the coming of Nevada Warren she and Gilbert and
Barbara Ross lined up into such a figurative triangle and of that
triangle Barbara formed the hypotenuse

One morning old Jerome was lingering long after breakfast over the
dullest morning paper in the city before setting forth to his downtown
flytrap He had become quite fond of Nevada finding in her much of
his dead brothers quiet independence and unsuspicious frankness

A maid brought in a note for Miss Nevada Warren

A messengerboy delivered it at the door please she said Hes
waiting for an answer

Nevada who was whistling a Spanish waltz between her teeth and
watching the carriages and autos roll by in the street took the
envelope She knew it was from Gilbert before she opened it by the
little gold palette in the upper lefthand corner

After tearing it open she pored over the contents for a while
absorbedly Then with a serious face she went and stood at her uncles
elbow

Uncle Jerome Gilbert is a nice boy isnt he

Why bless the child said old Jerome crackling his paper loudly of
course he is I raised him myself

He wouldnt write anything to anybody that wasnt exactlyI mean that
everybody couldnt know and read would he

Id just like to see him try it said uncle tearing a handful from
his newspaper Why what

Read this note he just sent me uncle and see if you think its all
right and proper You see I dont know much about city people and their
ways

Old Jerome threw his paper down and set both his feet upon it He took
Gilberts note and fiercely perused it twice and then a third time

Why child said he you had me almost excited although I was sure
of that boy Hes a duplicate of his father and he was a giltedged
diamond He only asks if you and Barbara will be ready at four oclock
this afternoon for an automobile drive over to Long Island I dont see
anything to criticise in it except the stationery I always did hate
that shade of blue

Would it be all right to go asked Nevada eagerly

Yes yes yes child of course Why not Still it pleases me to see
you so careful and candid Go by all means

I didnt know said Nevada demurely I thought Id ask you Couldnt
you go with us uncle

I No no no no Ive ridden once in a car that boy was driving
Never again But its entirely proper for you and Barbara to go Yes
yes But I will not No no no no

Nevada flew to the door and said to the maid

You bet well go Ill answer for Miss Barbara Tell the boy to say
to Mr Warren You bet well go

Nevada called old Jerome pardon me my dear but wouldnt it be
as well to send him a note in reply Just a line would do

No I wont bother about that said Nevada gayly Gilbert will
understandhe always does I never rode in an automobile in my life
but Ive paddled a canoe down Little Devil River through the Lost Horse
Canon and if its any livelier than that Id like to know


III


Two months are supposed to have elapsed

Barbara sat in the study of the hundredthousanddollar house It was a
good place for her Many places are provided in the world where men and
women may repair for the purpose of extricating themselves from divers
difficulties There are cloisters wailingplaces wateringplaces
confessionals hermitages lawyers offices beauty parlors airships
and studies and the greatest of these are studies

It usually takes a hypotenuse a long time to discover that it is the
longest side of a triangle But its a long line that has no turning

Barbara was alone Uncle Jerome and Nevada had gone to the theatre
Barbara had not cared to go She wanted to stay at home and study in
the study If you miss were a stunning New York girl and saw every
day that a brown ingenuous Western witch was getting hobbles and a
lasso on the young man you wanted for yourself you too would lose
taste for the oxidizedsilver setting of a musical comedy

Barbara sat by the quarteredoak library table Her right arm rested
upon the table and her dextral fingers nervously manipulated a sealed
letter The letter was addressed to Nevada Warren and in the upper
lefthand corner of the envelope was Gilberts little gold palette
It had been delivered at nine oclock after Nevada had left

Barbara would have given her pearl necklace to know what the letter
contained but she could not open and read it by the aid of steam or
a penhandle or a hairpin or any of the generally approved methods
because her position in society forbade such an act She had tried to
read some of the lines of the letter by holding the envelope up to a
strong light and pressing it hard against the paper but Gilbert had
too good a taste in stationery to make that possible

At eleventhirty the theatregoers returned It was a delicious winter
night Even so far as from the cab to the door they were powdered
thickly with the big flakes downpouring diagonally from the east Old
Jerome growled goodnaturedly about villainous cab service and blockaded
streets Nevada colored like a rose with sapphire eyes babbled of
the stormy nights in the mountains around dads cabin During all
these wintry apostrophes Barbara cold at heart sawed woodthe only
appropriate thing she could think of to do

Old Jerome went immediately upstairs to hotwaterbottles and quinine
Nevada fluttered into the study the only cheerfully lighted room
subsided into an armchair and while at the interminable task of
unbuttoning her elbow gloves gave oral testimony as to the demerits
of the show

Yes I think Mr Fields is really amusingsometimes said Barbara
Here is a letter for you dear that came by special delivery just
after you had gone

Who is it from asked Nevada tugging at a button

Well really said Barbara with a smile I can only guess The
envelope has that queer little thing in one corner that Gilbert
calls a palette but which looks to me rather like a gilt heart on a
schoolgirls valentine

I wonder what hes writing to me about remarked Nevada listlessly

Were all alike said Barbara all women We try to find out what is
in a letter by studying the postmark As a last resort we use scissors
and read it from the bottom upward Here it is

She made a motion as if to toss the letter across the table to Nevada

Great catamounts exclaimed Nevada These centrefire buttons are a
nuisance Id rather wear buckskins Oh Barbara please shuck the hide
off that letter and read it Itll be midnight before I get these gloves
off

Why dear you dont want me to open Gilberts letter to you Its for
you and you wouldnt wish any one else to read it of course

Nevada raised her steady calm sapphire eyes from her gloves

Nobody writes me anything that everybody mightnt read she said
Go on Barbara Maybe Gilbert wants us to go out in his car again
tomorrow

Curiosity can do more things than kill a cat and if emotions well
recognized as feminine are inimical to feline life then jealousy would
soon leave the whole world catless Barbara opened the letter with an
indulgent slightly bored air

Well dear said she Ill read it if you want me to

She slit the envelope and read the missive with swifttravelling eyes
read it again and cast a quick shrewd glance at Nevada who for
the time seemed to consider gloves as the world of her interest and
letters from rising artists as no more than messages from Mars

For a quarter of a minute Barbara looked at Nevada with a strange
steadfastness and then a smile so small that it widened her mouth only
the sixteenth part of an inch and narrowed her eyes no more than a
twentieth flashed like an inspired thought across her face

Since the beginning no woman has been a mystery to another woman Swift
as light travels each penetrates the heart and mind of another sifts
her sisters words of their cunningest disguises reads her most hidden
desires and plucks the sophistry from her wiliest talk like hairs from
a comb twiddling them sardonically between her thumb and fingers before
letting them float away on the breezes of fundamental doubt Long ago
Eves son rang the doorbell of the family residence in Paradise Park
bearing a strange lady on his arm whom he introduced Eve took her
daughterinlaw aside and lifted a classic eyebrow

The Land of Nod said the bride languidly flirting the leaf of a
palm I suppose youve been there of course

Not lately said Eve absolutely unstaggered Dont you think the
applesauce they serve over there is execrable I rather like that
mulberryleaf tunic effect dear but of course the real fig goods
are not to be had over there Come over behind this lilacbush while
the gentlemen split a celery tonic I think the caterpillarholes have
made your dress open a little in the back

So then and thereaccording to the recordswas the alliance formed
by the only two whoswho ladies in the world Then it was agreed that
woman should forever remain as clear as a pane of glassthough glass
was yet to be discoveredto other women and that she should palm
herself off on man as a mystery

Barbara seemed to hesitate

Really Nevada she said with a little show of embarrassment you
shouldnt have insisted on my opening this IIm sure it wasnt meant
for any one else to know

Nevada forgot her gloves for a moment

Then read it aloud she said Since youve already read it whats
the difference If Mr Warren has written to me something that any one
else oughtnt to know that is all the more reason why everybody should
know it

Well said Barbara this is what it says Dearest NevadaCome to
my studio at twelve oclock tonight Do not fail Barbara rose and
dropped the note in Nevadas lap Im awfully sorry she said that
I knew It isnt like Gilbert There must be some mistake Just consider
that I am ignorant of it will you dear I must go upstairs now I
have such a headache Im sure I dont understand the note Perhaps
Gilbert has been dining too well and will explain Good night


IV


Nevada tiptoed to the hall and heard Barbaras door close upstairs
The bronze clock in the study told the hour of twelve was fifteen
minutes away She ran swiftly to the front door and let herself out
into the snowstorm Gilbert Warrens studio was six squares away

By aerial ferry the white silent forces of the storm attacked the city
from beyond the sullen East River Already the snow lay a foot deep
on the pavements the drifts heaping themselves like scalingladders
against the walls of the besieged town The Avenue was as quiet as a
street in Pompeii Cabs now and then skimmed past like whitewinged
gulls over a moonlit ocean and less frequent motorcarssustaining the
comparisonhissed through the foaming waves like submarine boats on
their jocund perilous journeys

Nevada plunged like a winddriven stormpetrel on her way She looked
up at the ragged sierras of cloudcapped buildings that rose above the
streets shaded by the night lights and the congealed vapors to gray
drab ashen lavender dun and cerulean tints They were so like the
wintry mountains of her Western home that she felt a satisfaction such
as the hundredthousanddollar house had seldom brought her

A policeman caused her to waver on a corner just by his eye and weight

Hello Mabel said he Kind of late for you to be out aint it

II am just going to the drug store said Nevada hurrying past him

The excuse serves as a passport for the most sophisticated Does it
prove that woman never progresses or that she sprang from Adams rib
fullfledged in intellect and wiles

Turning eastward the direct blast cut down Nevadas speed onehalf She
made zigzag tracks in the snow but she was as tough as a pinon sapling
and bowed to it as gracefully Suddenly the studiobuilding loomed
before her a familiar landmark like a cliff above some wellremembered
canon The haunt of business and its hostile neighbor art was darkened
and silent The elevator stopped at ten

Up eight flights of Stygian stairs Nevada climbed and rapped firmly
at the door numbered 89 She had been there many times before with
Barbara and Uncle Jerome

Gilbert opened the door He had a crayon pencil in one hand a green
shade over his eyes and a pipe in his mouth The pipe dropped to the
floor

Am I late asked Nevada I came as quick as I could Uncle and me
were at the theatre this evening Here I am Gilbert

Gilbert did a PygmalionandGalatea act He changed from a statue of
stupefaction to a young man with a problem to tackle He admitted
Nevada got a whiskbroom and began to brush the snow from her clothes
A great lamp with a green shade hung over an easel where the artist
had been sketching in crayon

You wanted me said Nevada simply and I came You said so in your
letter What did you send for me for

You read my letter inquired Gilbert sparring for wind

Barbara read it to me I saw it afterward It said Come to my studio
at twelve tonight and do not fail I thought you were sick of
course but you dont seem to be

Aha said Gilbert irrelevantly Ill tell you why I asked you to
come Nevada I want you to marry me immediatelytonight Whats a
little snowstorm Will you do it

You might have noticed that I would long ago said Nevada And Im
rather stuck on the snowstorm idea myself I surely would hate one of
these flowery church noonweddings Gilbert I didnt know you had grit
enough to propose it this way Lets shock emits our funeral aint
it

You bet said Gilbert Where did I hear that expression he added
to himself Wait a minute Nevada I want to do a little phoning

He shut himself in a little dressingroom and called upon the
lightnings of the heavenscondensed into unromantic numbers and
districts

That you Jack You confounded sleepyhead Yes wake up this is meor
Ioh bother the difference in grammar Im going to be married right
away Yes Wake up your sisterdont answer me back bring her along
tooyou _must_ Remind Agnes of the time I saved her from drowning in
Lake RonkonkomaI know its caddish to refer to it but she must come
with you Yes Nevada is here waiting Weve been engaged quite a
while Some opposition among the relatives you know and we have to
pull it off this way Were waiting here for you Dont let Agnes
outtalk youbring her You will Good old boy Ill order a carriage
to call for you doublequick time Confound you Jack youre all
right

Gilbert returned to the room where Nevada waited

My old friend Jack Peyton and his sister were to have been here at
a quarter to twelve he explained but Jack is so confoundedly slow
Ive just phoned them to hurry Theyll be here in a few minutes Im
the happiest man in the world Nevada What did you do with the letter
I sent you today

Ive got it cinched here said Nevada pulling it out from beneath
her operacloak

Gilbert drew the letter from the envelope and looked it over carefully
Then he looked at Nevada thoughtfully

Didnt you think it rather queer that I should ask you to come to my
studio at midnight he asked

Why no said Nevada rounding her eyes Not if you needed me
Out West when a pal sends you a hurry callaint that what you say
herewe get there first and talk about it after the row is over And
its usually snowing there too when things happen So I didnt mind

Gilbert rushed into another room and came back burdened with overcoats
warranted to turn wind rain or snow

Put this raincoat on he said holding it for her We have a quarter
of a mile to go Old Jack and his sister will be here in a few minutes
He began to struggle into a heavy coat Oh Nevada he said just
look at the headlines on the front page of that evening paper on the
table will you Its about your section of the West and I know it will
interest you

He waited a full minute pretending to find trouble in the getting on of
his overcoat and then turned Nevada had not moved She was looking at
him with strange and pensive directness Her cheeks had a flush on them
beyond the color that had been contributed by the wind and snow but her
eyes were steady

I was going to tell you she said anyhow before youbefore
webeforewell before anything Dad never gave me a day of schooling
I never learned to read or write a darned word Now if

Pounding their uncertain way upstairs the feet of Jack the somnolent
and Agnes the grateful were heard


V


When Mr and Mrs Gilbert Warren were spinning softly homeward in a
closed carriage after the ceremony Gilbert said

Nevada would you really like to know what I wrote you in the letter
that you received tonight

Fire away said his bride

Word for word said Gilbert it was this My dear Miss WarrenYou
were right about the flower It was a hydrangea and not a lilac

All right said Nevada But lets forget it The jokes on Barbara
anyway




THIMBLE THIMBLE


These are the directions for finding the office of Carteret  Carteret
Mill Supplies and Leather Belting

You follow the Broadway trail down until you pass the Crosstown Line
the Bread Line and the Dead Line and come to the Big Canons of the
Moneygrubber Tribe Then you turn to the left to the right dodge a
pushcart and the tongue of a twoton fourhorse dray and hop skip
and jump to a granite ledge on the side of a twentyonestory synthetic
mountain of stone and iron In the twelfth story is the office of
Carteret  Carteret The factory where they make the mill supplies and
leather belting is in Brooklyn Those commoditiesto say nothing of
Brooklynnot being of interest to you let us hold the incidents within
the confines of a oneact onescene play thereby lessening the toil
of the reader and the expenditure of the publisher So if you have the
courage to face four pages of type and Carteret  Carterets office boy
Percival you shall sit on a varnished chair in the inner office and
peep at the little comedy of the Old Nigger Man the HuntingCase Watch
and the OpenFaced Questionmostly borrowed from the late Mr Frank
Stockton as you will conclude

First biography but pared to the quick must intervene I am for the
inverted sugarcoated quinine pillthe bitter on the outside

The Carterets were or was Columbia College professors please rule an
old Virginia family Long time ago the gentlemen of the family had worn
lace ruffles and carried tinless foils and owned plantations and had
slaves to burn But the war had greatly reduced their holdings Of
course you can perceive at once that this flavor has been shoplifted
from Mr F Hopkinson Smith in spite of the et after Carter Well
anyhow

In digging up the Carteret history I shall not take you farther back
than the year 1620 The two original American Carterets came over in
that year but by different means of transportation One brother named
John came in the _Mayflower_ and became a Pilgrim Father Youve seen his
picture on the covers of the Thanksgiving magazines hunting turkeys in
the deep snow with a blunderbuss Blandford Carteret the other brother
crossed the pond in his own brigantine landed on the Virginia coast
and became an FFV John became distinguished for piety and shrewdness
in business Blandford for his pride juleps marksmanship and vast
slavecultivated plantations

Then came the Civil War I must condense this historical
interpolation Stonewall Jackson was shot Lee surrendered Grant
toured the world cotton went to nine cents Old Crow whiskey and Jim
Crow cars were invented the Seventyninth Massachusetts Volunteers
returned to the Ninetyseventh Alabama Zouaves the battle flag of
Lundys Lane which they bought at a secondhand store in Chelsea kept
by a man named Skzchnzski Georgia sent the President a sixtypound
watermelonand that brings us up to the time when the story begins
My but that was sparring for an opening I really must brush op on my
Aristotle

The Yankee Carterets went into business in New York long before the war
Their house as far as Leather Belting and Mill Supplies was concerned
was as musty and arrogant and solid as one of those old East India
teaimporting concerns that you read about in Dickens There were some
rumors of a war behind its counters but not enough to affect the
business

During and after the war Blandford Carteret FFV lost his
plantations juleps marksmanship and life He bequeathed little
more than his pride to his surviving family So it came to pass that
Blandford Carteret the Fifth aged fifteen was invited by the
leatherandmillsupplies branch of that name to come North and learn
business instead of hunting foxes and boasting of the glory of his
fathers on the reduced acres of his impoverished family The boy jumped
at the chance and at the age of twentyfive sat in the office of the
firm equal partner with John the Fifth of the blunderbussandturkey
branch Here the story begins again

The young men were about the same age smooth of face alert easy of
manner and with an air that promised mental and physical quickness
They were razored blueserged strawhatted and pearl stickpinned
like other young New Yorkers who might be millionaires or bill clerks

One afternoon at four oclock in the private office of the firm
Blandford Carteret opened a letter that a clerk had just brought to his
desk After reading it he chuckled audibly for nearly a minute John
looked around from his desk inquiringly

Its from mother said Blandford Ill read you the funny part of
it She tells me all the neighborhood news first of course and then
cautions me against getting my feet wet and musical comedies After that
come vital statistics about calves and pigs and an estimate of the wheat
crop And now Ill quote some

And what do you think Old Uncle Jake who was seventysix last
Wednesday must go travelling Nothing would do but he must go to New
York and see his young Marster Blandford Old as he is he has a deal
of common sense so Ive let him go I couldnt refuse himhe seemed to
have concentrated all his hopes and desires into this one adventure into
the wide world You know he was born on the plantation and has never
been ten miles away from it in his life And he was your fathers body
servant during the war and has been always a faithful vassal and
servant of the family He has often seen the gold watchthe watch that
was your fathers and your fathers fathers I told him it was to be
yours And he begged me to allow him to take it to you and to put it
into your hands himself

So he has it carefully enclosed in a buckskin case and is bringing
it to you with all the pride and importance of a kings messenger I
gave him money for the round trip and for a two weeks stay in the city
I wish you would see to it that he gets comfortable quartersJake
wont need much looking afterhes able to take care of himself But
I have read in the papers that African bishops and colored potentates
generally have much trouble in obtaining food and lodging in the Yankee
metropolis That may be all right but I dont see why the best hotel
there shouldnt take Jake in Still I suppose its a rule

I gave him full directions about finding you and packed his valise
myself You wont have to bother with him but I do hope youll see that
he is made comfortable Take the watch that he brings youits almost a
decoration It has been worn by true Carterets and there isnt a stain
upon it nor a false movement of the wheels Bringing it to you is the
crowning joy of old Jakes life I wanted him to have that little outing
and that happiness before it is too late You have often heard us talk
about how Jake pretty badly wounded himself crawled through the
reddened grass at Chancellorsville to where your father lay with the
bullet in his dear heart and took the watch from his pocket to keep it
from the Yanks

So my son when the old man comes consider him as a frail but worthy
messenger from the oldtime life and home

You have been so long away from home and so long among the people
that we have always regarded as aliens that Im not sure that Jake will
know you when he sees you But Jake has a keen perception and I rather
believe that he will know a Virginia Carteret at sight I cant conceive
that even ten years in Yankeeland could change a boy of mine Anyhow
Im sure you will know Jake I put eighteen collars in his valise If
he should have to buy others he wears a number 1512 Please see that
he gets the right ones He will be no trouble to you at all

If you are not too busy Id like for you to find him a place to board
where they have whitemeal cornbread and try to keep him from taking
his shoes off in your office or on the street His right foot swells a
little and he likes to be comfortable

If you can spare the time count his handkerchiefs when they come back
from the wash I bought him a dozen new ones before he left He should
be there about the time this letter reaches you I told him to go
straight to your office when he arrives

As soon as Blandford had finished the reading of this something
happened as there should happen in stories and must happen on the
stage

Percival the office boy with his air of despising the worlds output
of mill supplies and leather belting came in to announce that a colored
gentleman was outside to see Mr Blandford Carteret

Bring him in said Blandford rising

John Carteret swung around in his chair and said to Percival Ask him
to wait a few minutes outside Well let you know when to bring him in

Then he turned to his cousin with one of those broad slow smiles that
was an inheritance of all the Carterets and said

Bland Ive always had a consuming curiosity to understand the
differences that you haughty Southerners believe to exist between you
all and the people of the North Of course I know that you consider
yourselves made out of finer clay and look upon Adam as only a
collateral branch of your ancestry but I dont know why I never could
understand the differences between us

Well John said Blandford laughing what you dont understand about
it is just the difference of course I suppose it was the feudal way
in which we lived that gave us our lordly baronial airs and feeling of
superiority

But you are not feudal now went on John Since we licked you
and stole your cotton and mules youve had to go to work just as we
damyankees as you call us have always been doing And youre just as
proud and exclusive and upperclassy as you were before the war So it
wasnt your money that caused it

Maybe it was the climate said Blandford lightly or maybe our
negroes spoiled us Ill call old Jake in now Ill be glad to see the
old villain again

Wait just a moment said John Ive got a little theory I want to
test You and I are pretty much alike in our general appearance Old
Jake hasnt seen you since you were fifteen Lets have him in and play
fair and see which of us gets the watch The old darky surely ought to
be able to pick out his young marster without any trouble The alleged
aristocratic superiority of a reb ought to be visible to him at once
He couldnt make the mistake of handing over the timepiece to a Yankee
of course The loser buys the dinner this evening and two dozen 1512
collars for Jake Is it a go

Blandford agreed heartily Percival was summoned and told to usher the
colored gentleman in

Uncle Jake stepped inside the private office cautiously He was a little
old man as black as soot wrinkled and bald except for a fringe of
white wool cut decorously short that ran over his ears and around his
head There was nothing of the stage uncle about him his black suit
nearly fitted him his shoes shone and his straw hat was banded with a
gaudy ribbon In his right hand he carried something carefully concealed
by his closed fingers

Uncle Jake stopped a few steps from the door Two young men sat in their
revolving deskchairs ten feet apart and looked at him in friendly
silence His gaze slowly shifted many times from one to the other He
felt sure that he was in the presence of one at least of the revered
family among whose fortunes his life had begun and was to end

One had the pleasing but haughty Carteret air the other had the
unmistakable straight long family nose Both had the keen black eyes
horizontal brows and thin smiling lips that had distinguished both
the Carteret of the _Mayflower_ and him of the brigantine Old Jake had
thought that he could have picked out his young master instantly from a
thousand Northerners but he found himself in difficulties The best he
could do was to use strategy

Howdy Marse Blandfordhowdy suh he said looking midway between
the two young men

Howdy Uncle Jake they both answered pleasantly and in unison Sit
down Have you brought the watch

Uncle Jake chose a hardbottom chair at a respectful distance sat on
the edge of it and laid his hat carefully on the floor The watch in
its buckskin case he gripped tightly He had not risked his life on the
battlefield to rescue that watch from his old marsters foes to hand
it over again to the enemy without a struggle

Yes suh I got it in my hand suh Im gwine give it to you right
away in jus a minute Old Missus told me to put it in young Marse
Blandfords hand and tell him to wear it for the family pride and
honor It was a mighty longsome trip for an old nigger man to maketen
thousand miles it must be back to old Viginia suh Youve growed
mightily young marster I wouldnt have reconnized you but for yo
powerful resemblance to old marster

With admirable diplomacy the old man kept his eyes roaming in the space
between the two men His words might have been addressed to either
Though neither wicked nor perverse he was seeking for a sign

Blandford and John exchanged winks

I reckon you done got you mas letter went on Uncle Jake She said
she was gwine to write to you bout my comin along up this erway

Yes yes Uncle Jake said John briskly My cousin and I have just
been notified to expect you We are both Carterets you know

Although one of us said Blandford was born and raised in the
North

So if you will hand over the watch said John

My cousin and I said Blandford

Will then see to it said John

That comfortable quarters are found for you said Blandford

With creditable ingenuity old Jake set up a cackling highpitched
protracted laugh He beat his knee picked up his hat and bent the brim
in an apparent paroxysm of humorous appreciation The seizure afforded
him a mask behind which he could roll his eyes impartially between
above and beyond his two tormentors

I sees what he chuckled after a while You genlemen is tryin to
have fun with the po old nigger But you cant fool old Jake I knowed
you Marse Blandford the minute I sot eyes on you You was a po skimpy
little boy no mo than about foteen when you lef home to come Noth
but I knowed you the minute I sot eyes on you You is the mawtal image
of old marster The other genleman resembles you mightily suh but you
cant fool old Jake on a member of the old Viginia family No suh

At exactly the same time both Carterets smiled and extended a hand for
the watch

Uncle Jakes wrinkled black face lost the expression of amusement to
which he had vainly twisted it He knew that he was being teased and
that it made little real difference as far as its safety went into
which of those outstretched hands he placed the family treasure But it
seemed to him that not only his own pride and loyalty but much of the
Virginia Carterets was at stake He had heard down South during the war
about that other branch of the family that lived in the North and fought
on the yuther side and it had always grieved him He had followed
his old marsters fortunes from stately luxury through war to almost
poverty And now with the last relic and reminder of him blessed by
old missus and intrusted implicitly to his care he had come ten
thousand miles as it seemed to deliver it into the hands of the one
who was to wear it and wind it and cherish it and listen to it tick off
the unsullied hours that marked the lives of the Carteretsof Virginia

His experience and conception of the Yankees had been an impression of
tyrantslowdown common trashin blue laying waste with fire and
sword He had seen the smoke of many burning homesteads almost as grand
as Carteret Hall ascending to the drowsy Southern skies And now he was
face to face with one of themand he could not distinguish him from his
young marster whom he had come to find and bestow upon him the emblem
of his kingshipeven as the arm clothed in white samite mystic
wonderful laid Excalibur in the right hand of Arthur He saw before him
two young men easy kind courteous welcoming either of whom might
have been the one he sought Troubled bewildered sorely grieved at
his weakness of judgment old Jake abandoned his loyal subterfuges
His right hand sweated against the buckskin cover of the watch He
was deeply humiliated and chastened Seriously now his prominent
yellowwhite eyes closely scanned the two young men At the end of his
scrutiny he was conscious of but one difference between them One wore a
narrow black tie with a white pearl stickpin The others fourinhand
was a narrow blue one pinned with a black pearl

And then to old Jakes relief there came a sudden distraction Drama
knocked at the door with imperious knuckles and forced Comedy to the
wings and Drama peeped with a smiling but set face over the footlights

Percival the hater of mill supplies brought in a card which he
handed with the manner of one bearing a cartel to BlueTie

Olivia De Ormond read BlueTie from the card He looked inquiringly
at his cousin

Why not have her in said BlackTie and bring matters to a
conclusion

Uncle Jake said one of the young men would you mind taking that
chair over there in the corner for a while A lady is coming inon some
business Well take up your case afterward

The lady whom Percival ushered in was young and petulantly decidedly
freshly consciously and intentionally pretty She was dressed with
such expensive plainness that she made you consider lace and ruffles as
mere tatters and rags But one great ostrich plume that she wore would
have marked her anywhere in the army of beauty as the wearer of the
merry helmet of Navarre

Miss De Ormond accepted the swivel chair at BlueTies desk Then the
gentlemen drew leatherupholstered seats conveniently near and spoke
of the weather

Yes said she I noticed it was warmer But I mustnt take up too
much of your time during business hours That is she continued
unless we talk business

She addressed her words to BlueTie with a charming smile

Very well said he You dont mind my cousin being present do you
We are generally rather confidential with each otherespecially in
business matters

Oh no caroled Miss De Ormond Id rather he did hear He knows all
about it anyhow In fact hes quite a material witness because he was
present when youwhen it happened I thought you might want to talk
things over beforewell before any action is taken as I believe the
lawyers say

Have you anything in the way of a proposition to make asked
BlackTie

Miss De Ormond looked reflectively at the neat toe of one of her dull
kidpumps

I had a proposal made to me she said If the proposal sticks it cuts
out the proposition Lets have that settled first

Well as far as began BlueTie

Excuse me cousin interrupted BlackTie if you dont mind my
cutting in And then he turned with a goodnatured air toward the
lady

Now lets recapitulate a bit he said cheerfully All three of us
besides other mutual acquaintances have been out on a good many larks
together

Im afraid Ill have to call the birds by another name said Miss De
Ormond

All right responded BlackTie with unimpaired cheerfulness suppose
we say squabs when we talk about the proposal and larks when we
discuss the proposition You have a quick mind Miss De Ormond Two
months ago some halfdozen of us went in a motorcar for a days run
into the country We stopped at a roadhouse for dinner My cousin
proposed marriage to you then and there He was influenced to do so of
course by the beauty and charm which no one can deny that you possess

I wish I had you for a press agent Mr Carteret said the beauty
with a dazzling smile

You are on the stage Miss De Ormond went on BlackTie You have
had doubtless many admirers and perhaps other proposals You must
remember too that we were a party of merrymakers on that occasion
There were a good many corks pulled That the proposal of marriage
was made to you by my cousin we cannot deny But hasnt it been your
experience that by common consent such things lose their seriousness
when viewed in the next days sunlight Isnt there something of a
code among good sportsI use the word in its best sensethat
wipes out each day the follies of the evening previous

Oh yes said Miss De Ormond I know that very well And Ive always
played up to it But as you seem to be conducting the casewith the
silent consent of the defendantIll tell you something more Ive got
letters from him repeating the proposal And theyre signed too

I understand said BlackTie gravely Whats your price for the
letters

Im not a cheap one said Miss De Ormond But I had decided to make
you a rate You both belong to a swell family Well if I _am_ on the
stage nobody can say a word against me truthfully And the money is only
a secondary consideration It isnt the money I was after II believed
himandand I liked him

She cast a soft entrancing glance at BlueTie from under her long
eyelashes

And the price went on BlackTie inexorably

Ten thousand dollars said the lady sweetly

Or

Or the fulfillment of the engagement to marry

I think it is time interrupted BlueTie for me to be allowed to say
a word or two You and I cousin belong to a family that has held its
head pretty high You have been brought up in a section of the country
very different from the one where our branch of the family lived Yet
both of us are Carterets even if some of our ways and theories differ
You remember it is a tradition of the family that no Carteret ever
failed in chivalry to a lady or failed to keep his word when it was
given

Then BlueTie with frank decision showing on his countenance turned
to Miss De Ormond

Olivia said he on what date will you marry me

Before she could answer BlackTie again interposed

It is a long journey said he from Plymouth rock to Norfolk Bay
Between the two points we find the changes that nearly three centuries
have brought In that time the old order has changed We no longer burn
witches or torture slaves And today we neither spread our cloaks on
the mud for ladies to walk over nor treat them to the duckingstool
It is the age of common sense adjustment and proportion All of
usladies gentlemen women men Northerners Southerners lords
caitiffs actors hardwaredrummers senators hodcarriers and
politiciansare coming to a better understanding Chivalry is one of
our words that changes its meaning every day Family pride is a thing
of many constructionsit may show itself by maintaining a motheaten
arrogance in a cobwebbed Colonial mansion or by the prompt paying of
ones debts

Now I suppose youve had enough of my monologue Ive learned
something of business and a little of life and I somehow believe
cousin that our greatgreatgrandfathers the original Carterets
would indorse my view of this matter

BlackTie wheeled around to his desk wrote in a checkbook and tore out
the check the sharp rasp of the perforated leaf making the only sound
in the room He laid the check within easy reach of Miss De Ormonds
hand

Business is business said he We live in a business age There is my
personal check for 10000 What do you say Miss De Ormondwill it he
orange blossoms or cash

Miss De Ormond picked up the cheek carelessly folded it indifferently
and stuffed it into her glove

Oh thisll do she said calmly I just thought Id call and put it
up to you I guess you people are all right But a girl has feelings
you know Ive heard one of you was a SouthernerI wonder which one of
you it is

She arose smiled sweetly and walked to the door There with a flash
of white teeth and a dip of the heavy plume she disappeared

Both of the cousins had forgotten Uncle Jake for the time But now they
heard the shuffling of his shoes as he came across the rug toward them
from his seat in the corner

Young marster he said take yo watch

And without hesitation he laid the ancient timepiece in the hand of its
rightful owner




SUPPLY AND DEMAND


Finch keeps a hatscleanedbyelectricitywhileyouwait establishment
nine feet by twelve in Third Avenue Once a customer you are always
his I do not know his secret process but every four days your hat
needs to be cleaned again

Finch is a leathern sallow slowfooted man between twenty and forty
You would say he had been brought up a bushelman in Essex Street When
business is slack he likes to talk so I had my hat cleaned even oftener
than it deserved hoping Finch might let me into some of the secrets of
the sweatshops

One afternoon I dropped in and found Finch alone He began to anoint my
headpiece de Panama with his mysterious fluid that attracted dust and
dirt like a magnet

They say the Indians weave em under water said I for a leader

Dont you believe it said Finch No Indian or white man could stay
under water that long Say do you pay much attention to politics I see
in the paper something about a law theyve passed called the law of
supply and demand

I explained to him as well as I could that the reference was to a
politicoeconomical law and not to a legal statute

I didnt know said Finch I heard a good deal about it a year or so
ago but in a onesided way

Yes said I political orators use it a great deal In fact they
never give it a rest I suppose you heard some of those carttail
fellows spouting on the subject over here on the east side

I heard it from a king said Finchthe white king of a tribe of
Indians in South America

I was interested but not surprised The big city is like a mothers knee
to many who have strayed far and found the roads rough beneath their
uncertain feet At dusk they come home and sit upon the doorstep
I know a piano player in a cheap cafe who has shot lions in Africa
a bellboy who fought in the British army against the Zulus an
expressdriver whose left arm had been cracked like a lobsters claw for
a stewpot of Patagonian cannibals when the boat of his rescuers hove in
sight So a hatcleaner who had been a friend of a king did not oppress
me

A new band asked Finch with his dry barren smile

Yes said I and half an inch wider I had had a new band five days
before

I meets a man one night said Finch beginning his storya man
brown as snuff with money in every pocket eating schweinerknuckel in
Schlagels That was two years ago when I was a hosecart driver for
No 98 His discourse runs to the subject of gold He says that certain
mountains in a country down South that he calls Gaudymala is full of it
He says the Indians wash it out of the streams in plural quantities

Oh Geronimo says I Indians Theres no Indians in the South I
tell him except Elks Maccabees and the buyers for the fall drygoods
trade The Indians are all on the reservations says I

Im telling you this with reservations says he They aint Buffalo
Bill Indians theyre squattier and more pedigreed They call em Inkers
and Aspics and they was old inhabitants when Mazuma was King of Mexico
They wash the gold out of the mountain streams says the brown man
and fill quills with it and then they empty em into red jars till
they are full and then they pack it in buckskin sacks of one arroba
eachan arroba is twentyfive poundsand store it in a stone house
with an engraving of a idol with marcelled hair playing a flute over
the door

How do they work off this unearth increment I asks

They dont says the man Its a case of Ill fares the land with
the great deal of velocity where wealth accumulates and there aint any
reciprocity

After this man and me got through our conversation which left him
dry of information I shook hands with him and told him I was sorry I
couldnt believe him And a month afterward I landed on the coast of
this Gaudymala with 1300 that I had been saving up for five years I
thought I knew what Indians liked and I fixed myself accordingly I
loaded down four packmules with red woollen blankets wroughtiron
pails jewelled sidecombs for the ladies glass necklaces and
safetyrazors I hired a black mozo who was supposed to be a
muledriver and an interpreter too It turned out that he could
interpret mules all right but he drove the English language much too
hard His name sounded like a Yale key when you push it in wrong side
up but I called him McClintock which was close to the noise

Well this gold village was forty miles up in the mountains and it
took us nine days to find it But one afternoon McClintock led the other
mules and myself over a rawhide bridge stretched across a precipice five
thousand feet deep it seemed to me The hoofs of the beasts drummed
on it just like before George M Cohan makes his first entrance on the
stage

This village was built of mud and stone and had no streets Some few
yellowandbrown persons popped their heads outofdoors looking about
like Welsh rabbits with Worcester sauce on em Out of the biggest house
that had a kind of a porch around it steps a big white man red as a
beet in color dressed in fine tanned deerskin clothes with a gold
chain around his neck smoking a cigar Ive seen United States Senators
of his style of features and build also headwaiters and cops

He walks up and takes a look at us while McClintock disembarks and
begins to interpret to the lead mule while he smokes a cigarette

Hello Buttinsky says the fine man to me How did you get in the
game I didnt see you buy any chips Who gave you the keys of the
city

Im a poor traveller says I Especially muleback Youll excuse
me Do you run a hack line or only a bluff

Segregate yourself from your pseudoequine quadruped says he and
come inside

He raises a finger and a villager runs up

This man will take care of your outfit says he and Ill take care
of you

He leads me into the biggest house and sets out the chairs and a kind
of a drink the color of milk It was the finest room I ever saw The
stone walls was hung all over with silk shawls and there was red and
yellow rugs on the floor and jars of red pottery and Angora goat skins
and enough bamboo furniture to misfurnish half a dozen seaside cottages

In the first place says the man you want to know who I am Im
sole lessee and proprietor of this tribe of Indians They call me the
Grand Yacuma which is to say King or Main Finger of the bunch Ive
got more power here than a charge daffaires a charge of dynamite and
a charge account at Tiffanys combined In fact Im the Big Stick
with as many extra knots on it as there is on the record run of the
Lusitania Oh I read the papers now and then says he Now lets
hear your entitlements he goes on and the meeting will be open

Well says I I am known as one W D Finch Occupation capitalist
Address 541 East Thirtysecond

New York chips in the Noble Grand I know says he grinning It
aint the first time youve seen it go down on the blotter I can tell
by the way you hand it out Well explain capitalist

I tells this boss plain what I come for and how I come to came

Golddust says he looking as puzzled as a baby thats got a feather
stuck on its molasses finger Thats funny This aint a goldmining
country And you invested all your capital on a strangers story
Well well These Indians of minethey are the last of the tribe of
Pechesare simple as children They know nothing of the purchasing
power of gold Im afraid youve been imposed on says he

Maybe so says I but it sounded pretty straight to me

W D says the King all of a sudden Ill give you a square deal
It aint often I get to talk to a white man and Ill give you a show
for your money It may be these constituents of mine have a few grains
of golddust hid away in their clothes Tomorrow you may get out these
goods youve brought up and see if you can make any sales Now Im
going to introduce myself unofficially My name is ShanePatrick Shane
I own this tribe of Peche Indians by right of conquestsingle handed
and unafraid I drifted up here four years ago and won em by my size
and complexion and nerve I learned their language in six weeksits
easy you simply emit a string of consonants as long as your breath
holds out and then point at what youre asking for

I conquered em spectacularly goes on King Shane and then I went
at em with economical politics law sleightofhand and a kind of New
England ethics and parsimony Every Sunday or as near as I can guess at
it I preach to em in the councilhouse Im the council on the law of
supply and demand I praise supply and knock demand I use the same text
every time You wouldnt think W D says Shane that I had poetry
in me would you

Well says I I wouldnt know whether to call it poetry or not

Tennyson says Shane furnishes the poetic gospel I preach I always
considered him the boss poet Heres the way the text goes


 For not to admire if a man could learn it were more
 Than to walk all day like a Sultan of old in a garden of spice


You see I teach em to cut out demandthat supply is the main
thing I teach em not to desire anything beyond their simplest needs
A little mutton a little cocoa and a little fruit brought up from
the coastthats all they want to make em happy Ive got em well
trained They make their own clothes and hats out of a vegetable fibre
and straw and theyre a contented lot Its a great thing winds up
Shane to have made a people happy by the incultivation of such simple
institutions

Well the next day with the Kings permission I has the McClintock
open up a couple of sacks of my goods in the little plaza of the
village The Indians swarmed around by the hundred and looked the
bargaincounter over I shook red blankets at em flashed fingerrings
and earbobs tried pearl necklaces and sidecombs on the women and a
line of red hosiery on the men Twas no use They looked on like hungry
graven images but I never made a sale I asked McClintock what was the
trouble Mac yawned three or four times rolled a cigarette made one or
two confidential side remarks to a mule and then condescended to inform
me that the people had no money

Just then up strolls King Patrick big and red and royal as usual
with the gold chain over his chest and his cigar in front of him

Hows business W D he asks

Fine says I Its a bargainday rush Ive got one more line of
goods to offer before I shut up shop Ill try em with safetyrazors
Ive got two gross that I bought at a fire sale

Shane laughs till some kind of mameluke or private secretary he carries
with him has to hold him up

O my sainted Aunt Jerusha says he aint you one of the Babes in
the Goods W D Dont you know that no Indians ever shave They pull
out their whiskers instead

Well says I thats just what these razors would do for emthey
wouldnt have any kick coming if they used em once

Shane went away and I could hear him laughing a block if there had
been any block

Tell em says I to McClintock it aint money I wanttell em Ill
take golddust Tell em Ill allow em sixteen dollars an ounce for it
in trade Thats what Im out forthe dust

Mac interprets and youd have thought a squadron of cops had charged
the crowd to disperse it Every uncles nephew and aunts niece of em
faded away inside of two minutes

At the royal palace that night me and the King talked it over

Theyve got the dust hid out somewhere says I or they wouldnt
have been so sensitive about it

They havent says Shane Whats this gag youve got about gold
You been reading Edward Allen Poe They aint got any gold

They put it in quills says I and then they empty it in jars and
then into sacks of twentyfive pounds each I got it straight

W D says Shane laughing and chewing his cigar I dont often see
a white man and I feel like putting you on I dont think youll get
away from here alive anyhow so Im going to tell you Come over here

He draws aside a silk fibre curtain in a corner of the room and shows
me a pile of buckskin sacks

Forty of em says Shane One arroba in each one In round numbers
220000 worth of golddust you see there Its all mine It belongs
to the Grand Yacuma They bring it all to me Two hundred and twenty
thousand dollarsthink of that you glassbead peddler says
Shaneand all mine

Little good it does you says I contemptuously and hatefully
And so you are the government depository of this gang of moneyless
moneymakers Dont you pay enough interest on it to enable one of your
depositors to buy an Augusta Maine Pullman carbon diamond worth 200
for 485

Listen says Patrick Shane with the sweat coming out on his brow
Im confidant with you as you have somehow enlisted my regards Did
you ever he says feel the avoirdupois power of goldnot the troy
weight of it but the sixteenouncestothepound force of it

Never says I I never take in any bad money

Shane drops down on the floor and throws his arms over the sacks of
golddust

I love it says he I want to feel the touch of it day and night
Its my pleasure in life I come in this room and Im a king and a rich
man Ill be a millionaire in another year The piles getting bigger
every month Ive got the whole tribe washing out the sands in the
creeks Im the happiest man in the world W D I just want to be near
this gold and know its mine and its increasing every day Now you
know says he why my Indians wouldnt buy your goods They cant
They bring all the dust to me Im their king Ive taught em not to
desire or admire You might as well shut up shop

Ill tell you what you are says I Youre a plain contemptible
miser You preach supply and you forget demand Now supply I goes
on is never anything but supply On the contrary says I demand is
a much broader syllogism and assertion Demand includes the rights of
our women and children and charity and friendship and even a little
begging on the street corners Theyve both got to harmonize equally
And Ive got a few things up my commercial sleeve yet says I that
may jostle your preconceived ideas of politics and economy

The next morning I had McClintock bring up another muleload of goods
to the plaza and open it up The people gathered around the same as
before

I got out the finest line of necklaces bracelets haircombs and
earrings that I carried and had the women put em on And then I played
trumps

Out of my last pack I opened up a half gross of handmirrors with
solid tinfoil backs and passed em around among the ladies That was
the first introduction of lookingglasses among the Peche Indians

Shane walks by with his big laugh

Business looking up any he asks

Its looking at itself right now says I

Byandby a kind of a murmur goes through the crowd The women had
looked into the magic crystal and seen that they were beautiful and was
confiding the secret to the men The men seemed to be urging the lack
of money and the hard times just before the election but their excuses
didnt go

Then was my time

I called McClintock away from an animated conversation with his mules
and told him to do some interpreting

Tell em says I that golddust will buy for them these befitting
ornaments for kings and queens of the earth Tell em the yellow sand
they wash out of the waters for the High Sanctified Yacomay and Chop
Suey of the tribe will buy the precious jewels and charms that will make
them beautiful and preserve and pickle them from evil spirits Tell em
the Pittsburgh banks are paying four per cent interest on deposits
by mail while this getrichfrequently custodian of the public funds
aint even paying attention Keep telling em Mac says I to let the
golddust family do their work Talk to em like a born antiBryanite
says I Remind em that Tom Watsons gone back to Georgia says I

McClintock waves his hand affectionately at one of his mules and then
hurls a few stickfuls of minion type at the mob of shoppers

A guttapercha Indian man with a lady hanging on his arm with three
strings of my fishscale jewelry and imitation marble beads around her
neck stands up on a block of stone and makes a talk that sounds like
a man shaking dice in a box to fill aces and sixes

He says says McClintock that the people not know that golddust
will buy their things The women very mad The Grand Yacuma tell them
it no good but for keep to make bad spirits keep away

You cant keep bad spirits away from money says I

They say goes on McClintock the Yacuma fool them They raise
plenty row

Going Going says I Golddust or cash takes the entire stock The
dust weighed before you and taken at sixteen dollars the ouncethe
highest price on the Gaudymala coast

Then the crowd disperses all of a sudden and I dont know whats up
Mac and me packs away the handmirrors and jewelry they had handed back
to us and we had the mules back to the corral they had set apart for
our garage

While we was there we hear great noises of shouting and down across
the plaza runs Patrick Shane hotfoot with his clothes ripped half off
and scratches on his face like a cat had fought him hard for every one
of its lives

Theyre looting the treasury W D he sings out Theyre going to
kill me and you too Unlimber a couple of mules at once Well have to
make a getaway in a couple of minutes

Theyve found out says I the truth about the law of supply and
demand

Its the women mostly says the King And they used to admire me
so

They hadnt seen lookingglasses then says I

Theyve got knives and hatchets says Shane hurry

Take that roan mule says I You and your law of supply Ill ride
the dun for hes two knots per hour the faster The roan has a stiff
knee but he may make it says I If youd included reciprocity in
your political platform I might have given you the dun says I

Shane and McClintock and me mounted our mules and rode across the
rawhide bridge just as the Peches reached the other side and began
firing stones and long knives at us We cut the thongs that held up
our end of the bridge and headed for the coast



A tall bulky policeman came into Finchs shop at that moment and leaned
an elbow on the showcase Finch nodded at him friendly

I heard down at Caseys said the cop in rumbling husky tones that
there was going to be a picnic of the HatCleaners Union over at Bergen
Beach Sunday Is that right

Sure said Finch Therell be a dandy time

Gimme five tickets said the cop throwing a fivedollar bill on the
showcase

Why said Finch aint you going it a little too

Go to h said the cop You got em to sell aint you Somebodys
got to buy em Wish I could go along

I was glad to See Finch so well thought of in his neighborhood

And then in came a wee girl of seven with dirty face and pure blue eyes
and a smutched and insufficient dress

Mamma says she recited shrilly that you must give me eighty cents
for the grocer and nineteen for the milkman and five cents for me to buy
hokeypokey withbut she didnt say that the elf concluded with a
hopeful but honest grin

Finch shelled out the money counting it twice but I noticed that the
total sum that the small girl received was one dollar and four cents

Thats the right kind of a law remarked Finch as he carefully broke
some of the stitches of my hatband so that it would assuredly come off
within a few daysthe law of supply and demand But theyve both got
to work together Ill bet he went on with his dry smile shell get
jelly beans with that nickelshe likes em Whats supply if theres no
demand for it

What ever became of the King I asked curiously

Oh I might have told you said Finch That was Shane came in and
bought the tickets He came back with me and hes on the force now




BURIED TREASURE


There are many kinds of fools Now will everybody please sit still
until they are called upon specifically to rise

I had been every kind of fool except one I had expended my
patrimony pretended my matrimony played poker lawntennis and
bucketshopsparted soon with my money in many ways But there remained
one rule of the wearer of cap and bells that I had not played That was
the Seeker after Buried Treasure To few does the delectable furor come
But of all the wouldbe followers in the hoofprints of King Midas none
has found a pursuit so rich in pleasurable promise

But going back from my theme a whileas lame pens must doI was a
fool of the sentimental sort I saw May Martha Mangum and was hers
She was eighteen the color of the white ivory keys of a new piano
beautiful and possessed by the exquisite solemnity and pathetic
witchery of an unsophisticated angel doomed to live in a small dull
Texas prairietown She had a spirit and charm that could have enabled
her to pluck rubies like raspberries from the crown of Belgium or any
other sporty kingdom but she did not know it and I did not paint the
picture for her

You see I wanted May Martha Mangum for to have and to hold I wanted
her to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in
places where they cannot be found of evenings

May Marthas father was a man hidden behind whiskers and spectacles He
lived for bugs and butterflies and all insects that fly or crawl or buzz
or get down your back or in the butter He was an etymologist or words
to that effect He spent his life seining the air for flying fish of
the Junebug order and then sticking pins through em and calling em
names

He and May Martha were the whole family He prized her highly as a
fine specimen of the _racibus humanus_ because she saw that he had
food at times and put his clothes on right side before and kept
his alcoholbottles filled Scientists they say are apt to be
absentminded

There was another besides myself who thought May Martha Mangum one to be
desired That was Goodloe Banks a young man just home from college He
had all the attainments to be found in booksLatin Greek philosophy
and especially the higher branches of mathematics and logic

If it hadnt been for his habit of pouring out this information and
learning on every one that he addressed Id have liked him pretty well
But even as it was he and I were you would have thought great pals

We got together every time we could because each of us wanted to pump
the other for whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew
from the heart of May Martha Mangumrather a mixed metaphor Goodloe
Banks would never have been guilty of that That is the way of rivals

You might say that Goodloe ran to books manners culture rowing
intellect and clothes I would have put you in mind more of baseball
and Fridaynight debating societiesby way of cultureand maybe of a
good horseback rider

But in our talks together and in our visits and conversation with May
Martha neither Goodloe Banks nor I could find out which one of us she
preferred May Martha was a naturalborn noncommittal and knew in her
cradle how to keep people guessing

As I said old man Mangum was absentminded After a long time he found
out one daya little butterfly must have told himthat two young
men were trying to throw a net over the head of the young person
a daughter or some such technical appendage who looked after his
comforts

I never knew scientists could rise to such occasions Old Mangum orally
labelled and classified Goodloe and myself easily among the lowest
orders of the vertebrates and in English too without going any
further into Latin than the simple references to _Orgetorix Rex
Helvetii_which is as far as I ever went myself And he told us that
if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his
collection

Goodloe Banks and I remained away five days expecting the storm to
subside When we dared to call at the house again May Martha Mangum and
her father were gone Gone The house they had rented was closed Their
little store of goods and chattels was gone also

And not a word of farewell to either of us from May Marthanot a white
fluttering note pinned to the hawthornbush not a chalkmark on the
gatepost nor a postcard in the postoffice to give us a clew

For two months Goodloe Banks and Iseparatelytried every scheme
we could think of to track the runaways We used our friendship and
influence with the ticketagent with liverystable men railroad
conductors and our one lone lorn constable but without results

Then we became better friends and worse enemies than ever We
forgathered in the back room of Snyders saloon every afternoon after
work and played dominoes and laid conversational traps to find out
from each other if anything had been discovered That is the way of
rivals

Now Goodloe Banks had a sarcastic way of displaying his own learning
and putting me in the class that was reading Poor Jane Ray her bird
is dead she cannot play Well I rather liked Goodloe and I had
a contempt for his college learning and I was always regarded as
goodnatured so I kept my temper And I was trying to find out if he
knew anything about May Martha so I endured his society

In talking things over one afternoon he said to me

Suppose you do find her Ed whereby would you profit Miss Mangum has
a mind Perhaps it is yet uncultured but she is destined for higher
things than you could give her I have talked with no one who seemed to
appreciate more the enchantment of the ancient poets and writers and
the modern cults that have assimilated and expended their philosophy of
life Dont you think you are wasting your time looking for her

My idea said I of a happy home is an eightroom house in a grove of
liveoaks by the side of a _charco_ on a Texas prairie A piano I went
on with an automatic player in the sittingroom three thousand head
of cattle under fence for a starter a buckboard and ponies always
hitched at a post for the missusand May Martha Mangum to spend the
profits of the ranch as she pleases and to abide with me and put my
slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of
evenings That said I is what is to be and a figa dried Smyrna
dagostand figfor your curriculums cults and philosophy

She is meant for higher things repeated Goodloe Banks

Whatever she is meant for I answered just now she is out of pocket
And I shall find her as soon as I can without aid of the colleges

The game is blocked said Goodloe putting down a domino and we had
the beer

Shortly after that a young farmer whom I knew came into town and brought
me a folded blue paper He said his grandfather had just died I
concealed a tear and he went on to say that the old man had jealously
guarded this paper for twenty years He left it to his family as part of
his estate the rest of which consisted of two mules and a hypotenuse of
nonarable land

The sheet of paper was of the old blue kind used during the rebellion
of the abolitionists against the secessionists It was dated June
14 1863 and it described the hidingplace of ten burroloads of
gold and silver coin valued at three hundred thousand dollars Old
Rundlegrandfather of his grandson Samwas given the information by
a Spanish priest who was in on the treasureburying and who died many
years beforeno afterwardin old Rundles house Old Rundle wrote it
down from dictation

Why didnt your father look this up I asked young Rundle

He went blind before he could do so he replied

Why didnt you hunt for it yourself I asked

Well said he Ive only known about the paper for ten years First
there was the spring ploughin to do and then choppin the weeds out of
the corn and then come takin fodder and mighty soon winter was on us
It seemed to run along that way year after year

That sounded perfectly reasonable to me so I took it up with young Lee
Rundle at once

The directions on the paper were simple The whole burro cavalcade laden
with the treasure started from an old Spanish mission in Dolores County
They travelled due south by the compass until they reached the Alamito
River They forded this and buried the treasure on the top of a little
mountain shaped like a packsaddle standing in a row between two higher
ones A heap of stones marked the place of the buried treasure All the
party except the Spanish priest were killed by Indians a few days later
The secret was a monopoly It looked good to me

Lee Rundle suggested that we rig out a camping outfit hire a surveyor
to run out the line from the Spanish mission and then spend the three
hundred thousand dollars seeing the sights in Fort Worth But without
being highly educated I knew a way to save time and expense

We went to the State landoffice and had a practical what they call a
working sketch made of all the surveys of land from the old mission
to the Alamito River On this map I drew a line due southward to the
river The length of lines of each survey and section of land was
accurately given on the sketch By these we found the point on the river
and had a connection made with it and an important wellidentified
corner of the Los Animos fiveleague surveya grant made by King Philip
of Spain

By doing this we did not need to have the line run out by a surveyor It
was a great saving of expense and time

So Lee Rundle and I fitted out a twohorse wagon team with all the
accessories and drove a hundred and fortynine miles to Chico the
nearest town to the point we wished to reach There we picked up a
deputy county surveyor He found the corner of the Los Animos survey for
us ran out the five thousand seven hundred and twenty varas west that
our sketch called for laid a stone on the spot had coffee and bacon
and caught the mailstage back to Chico

I was pretty sure we would get that three hundred thousand dollars
Lee Rundles was to be only onethird because I was paying all the
expenses With that two hundred thousand dollars I knew I could find
May Martha Mangum if she was on earth And with it I could flutter the
butterflies in old man Mangums dovecot too If I could find that
treasure

But Lee and I established camp Across the river were a dozen little
mountains densely covered by cedarbrakes but not one shaped like
a packsaddle That did not deter us Appearances are deceptive A
packsaddle like beauty may exist only in the eye of the beholder

I and the grandson of the treasure examined those cedarcovered hills
with the care of a lady hunting for the wicked flea We explored every
side top circumference mean elevation angle slope and concavity of
every one for two miles up and down the river We spent four days doing
so Then we hitched up the roan and the dun and hauled the remains
of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and fortynine miles back to
Concho City

Lee Rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip I was busy driving
because I was in a hurry

As shortly as could be after our empty return Goodloe Banks and I
forgathered in the back room of Snyders saloon to play dominoes and
fish for information I told Goodloe about my expedition after the
buried treasure

If I could have found that three hundred thousand dollars I said to
him I could have scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find
May Martha Mangum

She is meant for higher things said Goodloe I shall find her
myself But tell me how you went about discovering the spot where this
unearthed increment was imprudently buried

I told him in the smallest detail I showed him the draughtsmans sketch
with the distances marked plainly upon it

After glancing over it in a masterly way he leaned back in his chair
and bestowed upon me an explosion of sardonic superior collegiate
laughter

Well you _are_ a fool Jim he said when he could speak

Its your play said I patiently fingering my doublesix

Twenty said Goodloe making two crosses on the table with his chalk

Why am I a fool I asked Buried treasure has been found before in
many places

Because said he in calculating the point on the river where
your line would strike you neglected to allow for the variation The
variation there would be nine degrees west Let me have your pencil

Goodloe Banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope

The distance from north to south of the line run from the Spanish
mission said he is exactly twentytwo miles It was run by a
pocketcompass according to your story Allowing for the variation
the point on the Alamito River where you should have searched for your
treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and fortyfive varas
farther west than the place you hit upon Oh what a fool you are Jim

What is this variation that you speak of I asked I thought figures
never lied

The variation of the magnetic compass said Goodloe from the true
meridian

He smiled in his superior way and then I saw come out in his face the
singular eager consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure

Sometimes he said with the air of the oracle these old traditions
of hidden money are not without foundation Suppose you let me look over
that paper describing the location Perhaps together we might

The result was that Goodloe Banks and I rivals in love became
companions in adventure We went to Chico by stage from Huntersburg
the nearest railroad town In Chico we hired a team drawing a covered
springwagon and camping paraphernalia We had the same surveyor run
out our distance as revised by Goodloe and his variations and then
dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road

It was night when we arrived I fed the horses and made a fire near the
bank of the river and cooked supper Goodloe would have helped but his
education had not fitted him for practical things

But while I worked he cheered me with the expression of great thoughts
handed down from the dead ones of old He quoted some translations from
the Greek at much length

Anacreon he explained That was a favorite passage with Miss
Mangumas I recited it

She is meant for higher things said I repeating his phrase

Can there be anything higher asked Goodloe than to dwell in the
society of the classics to live in the atmosphere of learning and
culture You have often decried education What of your wasted efforts
through your ignorance of simple mathematics How soon would you have
found your treasure if my knowledge had not shown you your error

Well take a look at those hills across the river first said I
and see what we find I am still doubtful about variations I have
been brought up to believe that the needle is true to the pole

The next morning was a bright June one We were up early and had
breakfast Goodloe was charmed He recitedKeats I think it was and
Kelly or Shelleywhile I broiled the bacon We were getting ready to
cross the river which was little more than a shallow creek there and
explore the many sharppeaked cedarcovered hills on the other side

My good Ulysses said Goodloe slapping me on the shoulder while I was
washing the tin breakfastplates let me see the enchanted document
once more I believe it gives directions for climbing the hill shaped
like a packsaddle I never saw a packsaddle What is it like Jim

Score one against culture said I Ill know it when I see it

Goodloe was looking at old Rundles document when he ripped out a most
uncollegiate swearword

Come here he said holding the paper up against the sunlight Look
at that he said laying his finger against it

On the blue papera thing I had never noticed beforeI saw stand out
in white letters the word and figures Malvern 1898

What about it I asked

Its the watermark said Goodloe The paper was manufactured in
1898 The writing on the paper is dated 1863 This is a palpable fraud

Oh I dont know said I The Rundles are pretty reliable plain
uneducated country people Maybe the paper manufacturers tried to
perpetrate a swindle

And then Goodloe Banks went as wild as his education permitted He
dropped the glasses off his nose and glared at me

Ive often told you you were a fool he said You have let yourself
be imposed upon by a clodhopper And you have imposed upon me

How I asked have I imposed upon you

By your ignorance said he Twice I have discovered serious flaws in
your plans that a commonschool education should have enabled you to
avoid And he continued I have been put to expense that I could ill
afford in pursuing this swindling quest I am done with it

I rose and pointed a large pewter spoon at him fresh from the
dishwater

Goodloe Banks I said I care not one parboiled navy bean for your
education I always barely tolerated it in any one and I despised it in
you What has your learning done for you It is a curse to yourself and
a bore to your friends Away I saidaway with your watermarks and
variations They are nothing to me They shall not deflect me from the
quest

I pointed with my spoon across the river to a small mountain shaped like
a packsaddle

I am going to search that mountain I went on for the treasure
Decide now whether you are in it or not If you wish to let a
watermark or a variation shake your soul you are no true adventurer
Decide

A white cloud of dust began to rise far down the river road It was the
mailwagon from Hesperus to Chico Goodloe flagged it

I am done with the swindle said he sourly No one but a fool would
pay any attention to that paper now Well you always were a fool Jim
I leave you to your fate

He gathered his personal traps climbed into the mailwagon adjusted
his glasses nervously and flew away in a cloud of dust

After I had washed the dishes and staked the horses on new grass
I crossed the shallow river and made my way slowly through the
cedarbrakes up to the top of the hill shaped like a packsaddle

It was a wonderful June day Never in my life had I seen so many birds
so many butterflies dragonflies grasshoppers and such winged and
stinged beasts of the air and fields

I investigated the hill shaped like a packsaddle from base to summit
I found an absolute absence of signs relating to buried treasure There
was no pile of stones no ancient blazes on the trees none of the
evidences of the three hundred thousand dollars as set forth in the
document of old man Rundle

I came down the hill in the cool of the afternoon Suddenly out of the
cedarbrake I stepped into a beautiful green valley where a tributary
small stream ran into the Alamito River



And there I was startled to see what I took to be a wild man with
unkempt beard and ragged hair pursuing a giant butterfly with brilliant
wings

Perhaps he is an escaped madman I thought and wondered how he had
strayed so far from seats of education and learning

And then I took a few more steps and saw a vinecovered cottage near
the small stream And in a little grassy glade I saw May Martha Mangum
plucking wild flowers

She straightened up and looked at me For the first time since I knew
her I saw her facewhich was the color of the white keys of a new
pianoturn pink I walked toward her without a word She let the
gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass

I knew you would come Jim she said clearly Father wouldnt let me
write but I knew you would come

What followed you may guessthere was my wagon and team just across the
river



Ive often wondered what good too much education is to a man if he cant
use it for himself If all the benefits of it are to go to others where
does it come in

For May Martha Mangum abides with me There is an eightroom house in a
liveoak grove and a piano with an automatic player and a good start
toward the three thousand head of cattle is under fence

And when I ride home at night my pipe and slippers are put away in
places where they cannot be found

But who cares for that Who careswho cares




TO HIM WHO WAITS


The Hermit of the Hudson was hustling about his cave with unusual
animation

The cave was on or in the top of a little spur of the Catskills that had
strayed down to the rivers edge and not having a ferry ticket had to
stop there The bijou mountains were densely wooded and were infested
by ferocious squirrels and woodpeckers that forever menaced the summer
transients Like a badly sewn strip of white braid a macadamized road
ran between the green skirt of the hills and the foamy lace of the
rivers edge A dim path wound from the comfortable road up a rocky
height to the hermits cave One mile upstream was the Viewpoint Inn
to which summer folk from the city came leaving cool electricfanned
apartments that they might be driven about in burning sunshine
shrieking in gasoline launches by spindlelegged Modreds bearing the
blankest of shields

Train your lorgnette upon the hermit and let your eye receive the
personal touch that shall endear you to the hero

A man of forty judging him fairly with long hair curling at the ends
dramatic eyes and a forked brown beard like those that were imposed
upon the West some years ago by selfappointed divine healers who
succeeded the grasshopper crop His outward vesture appeared to be kind
of gunnysacking cut and made into a garment that would have made the
fortune of a London tailor His long wellshaped fingers delicate
nose and poise of manner raised him high above the class of hermits
who fear water and bury money in oystercans in their caves in spots
indicated by rude crosses chipped in the stone wall above

The hermits home was not altogether a cave The cave was an addition
to the hermitage which was a rude hut made of poles daubed with clay
and covered with the best quality of rustproof zinc roofing

In the house proper there were stone slabs for seats a rustic bookcase
made of unplaned poplar planks and a table formed of a wooden slab laid
across two upright pieces of granitesomething between the furniture of
a Druid temple and that of a Broadway beefsteak dungeon Hung against
the walls were skins of wild animals purchased in the vicinity of Eighth
Street and University Place New York

The rear of the cabin merged into the cave There the hermit cooked his
meals on a rude stone hearth With infinite patience and an old axe he
had chopped natural shelves in the rocky walls On them stood his stores
of flour bacon lard talcumpowder kerosene bakingpowder sodamint
tablets pepper salt and OlivoCremo Emulsion for chaps and roughness
of the hands and face

The hermit had hermited there for ten years He was an asset of the
Viewpoint Inn To its guests he was second in interest only to the
Mysterious Echo in the Haunted Glen And the Lovers Leap beat him only
a few inches flatfooted He was known far but not very wide on
account of the topography as a scholar of brilliant intellect who had
forsworn the world because he had been jilted in a love affair Every
Saturday night the Viewpoint Inn sent to him surreptitiously a basket
of provisions He never left the immediate outskirts of his hermitage
Guests of the inn who visited him said his store of knowledge wit and
scintillating philosophy were simply wonderful you know

That summer the Viewpoint Inn was crowded with guests So on Saturday
nights there were extra cans of tomatoes and sirloin steak instead
of rounds in the hermits basket

Now you have the material allegations in the case So make way for
Romance

Evidently the hermit expected a visitor He carefully combed his
long hair and parted his apostolic beard When the ninetyeightcent
alarmclock on a stone shelf announced the hour of five he picked up his
gunnysacking skirts brushed them carefully gathered an oaken staff
and strolled slowly into the thick woods that surrounded the hermitage

He had not long to wait Up the faint pathway slippery with its carpet
of pineneedles toiled Beatrix youngest and fairest of the famous
Trenholme sisters She was all in blue from hat to canvas pumps varying
in tint from the shade of the tinkle of a bluebell at daybreak on a
spring Saturday to the deep hue of a Monday morning at nine when the
washerwoman has failed to show up

Beatrix dug her cerulean parasol deep into the pineneedles and sighed
The hermit on the _q t_ removed a grass burr from the ankle of
one sandalled foot with the big toe of his other one She bluedand
almost starched and ironed himwith her cobalt eyes

It must be so nice she said in little tremulous gasps to be a
hermit and have ladies climb mountains to talk to you

The hermit folded his arms and leaned against a tree Beatrix with a
sigh settled down upon the mat of pineneedles like a bluebird upon her
nest The hermit followed suit drawing his feet rather awkwardly under
his gunnysacking

It must be nice to be a mountain said he with ponderous lightness
and have angels in blue climb up you instead of flying over you

Mamma had neuralgia said Beatrix and went to bed or I couldnt
have come Its dreadfully hot at that horrid old inn But we hadnt
the money to go anywhere else this summer

Last night said the hermit I climbed to the top of that big rock
above us I could see the lights of the inn and hear a strain or two of
the music when the wind was right I imagined you moving gracefully in
the arms of others to the dreamy music of the waltz amid the fragrance
of flowers Think how lonely I must have been

The youngest handsomest and poorest of the famous Trenholme sisters
sighed

You havent quite hit it she said plaintively I was moving
gracefully _at_ the arms of another Mamma had one of her periodical
attacks of rheumatism in both elbows and shoulders and I had to rub
them for an hour with that horrid old liniment I hope you didnt think
_that_ smelled like flowers You know there were some West Point boys
and a yacht load of young men from the city at last evenings weekly
dance Ive known mamma to sit by an open window for three hours with
onehalf of her registering 85 degrees and the other half frostbitten
and never sneeze once But just let a bunch of ineligibles come around
where I am and shell begin to swell at the knuckles and shriek with
pain And I have to take her to her room and rub her arms To see mamma
dressed youd be surprised to know the number of square inches of surface
there are to her arms I think it must be delightful to be a hermit
Thatcassockor gabardine isnt itthat you wear is so becoming
Do you make itor themof course you must have changesyourself And
what a blessed relief it must be to wear sandals instead of shoes Think
how we must sufferno matter how small I buy my shoes they always pinch
my toes Oh why cant there be lady hermits too

The beautifulest and most adolescent Trenholme sister extended
two slender blue ankles that ended in two enormous bluesilk
bows that almost concealed two fairy Oxfords also of one of the
fortyseven shades of blue The hermit as if impelled by a kind of
reflextelepathic action drew his bare toes farther beneath his
gunnysacking

I have heard about the romance of your life said Miss Trenholme
softly They have it printed on the back of the menu card at the inn
Was she very beautiful and charming

On the bills of fare muttered the hermit but what do I care for the
worlds babble Yes she was of the highest and grandest type Then
he continued _then_ I thought the world could never contain another
equal to her So I forsook it and repaired to this mountain fastness
to spend the remainder of my life aloneto devote and dedicate my
remaining years to her memory

Its grand said Miss Trenholme absolutely grand I think a hermits
life is the ideal one No billcollectors calling no dressing for
dinnerhow Id like to be one But theres no such luck for me If I
dont marry this season I honestly believe mamma will force me into
settlement work or trimming hats It isnt because Im getting old or
ugly but we havent enough money left to butt in at any of the swell
places any more And I dont want to marryunless its somebody I like
Thats why Id like to be a hermit Hermits dont ever marry do they

Hundreds of em said the hermit when theyve found the right one

But theyre hermits said the youngest and beautifulest because
theyve lost the right one arent they

Because they think they have answered the recluse fatuously
Wisdom comes to one in a mountain cave as well as to one in the world
of swells as I believe they are called in the argot

When one of the swells brings it to them said Miss Trenholme And
my folks are swells Thats the trouble But there are so many swells
at the seashore in the summertime that we hardly amount to more than
ripples So weve had to put all our money into river and harbor
appropriations We were all girls you know There were four of us Im
the only surviving one The others have been married off All to money
Mamma is so proud of my sisters They send her the loveliest penwipers
and art calendars every Christmas Im the only one on the market now
Im forbidden to look at any one who hasnt money

But began the hermit

But oh said the beautifulest of course hermits have great pots of
gold and doubloons buried somewhere near three great oaktrees They all
have

I have not said the hermit regretfully

Im so sorry said Miss Trenholme I always thought they had I think
I must go now

Oh beyond question she was the beautifulest

Fair lady began the hermit

I am Beatrix Trenholmesome call me Trix she said You must come
to the inn to see me

I havent been a stonesthrow from my cave in ten years said the
hermit

You must come to see me there she repeated Any evening except
Thursday

The hermit smiled weakly

Goodbye she said gathering the folds of her paleblue skirt I
shall expect you But not on Thursday evening remember

What an interest it would give to the future menu cards of the Viewpoint
Inn to have these printed lines added to them Only once during the
more than ten years of his lonely existence did the mountain hermit
leave his famous cave That was when he was irresistibly drawn to the
inn by the fascinations of Miss Beatrix Trenholme youngest and most
beautiful of the celebrated Trenholme sisters whose brilliant marriage
to

Aye to whom

The hermit walked back to the hermitage At the door stood Bob Binkley
his old friend and companion of the days before he had renounced the
worldBob himself arrayed like the orchids of the greenhouse in the
summer mans polychromatic garbBob the millionaire with his fat
firm smooth shrewd face his diamond rings sparkling fobchain and
pleated bosom He was two years older than the hermit and looked five
years younger

Youre Hamp Ellison in spite of those whiskers and that goingaway
bathrobe he shouted I read about you on the bill of fare at the inn
Theyve run your biography in between the cheese and Not Responsible
for Coats and Umbrellas What d you do it for Hamp And ten years
toogee whilikins

Youre just the same said the hermit Come in and sit down Sit on
that limestone rock over there its softer than the granite

I cant understand it old man said Binkley I can see how you could
give up a woman for ten years but not ten years for a woman Of course
I know why you did it Everybody does Edith Carr She jilted four or
five besides you But you were the only one who took to a hole in the
ground The others had recourse to whiskey the Klondike politics and
that _similia similibus_ cure But sayHamp Edith Carr was just about
the finest woman in the worldhightoned and proud and noble and
playing her ideals to win at all kinds of odds She certainly was a
crackerjack

After I renounced the world said the hermit I never heard of her
again

She married me said Binkley

The hermit leaned against the wooden walls of his antecave and wriggled
his toes

I know how you feel about it said Binkley What else could she
do There were her four sisters and her mother and old man Carryou
remember how he put all the money he had into dirigible balloons Well
everything was coming down and nothing going up with em as you might
say Well I know Edith as well as you doalthough I married her I was
worth a million then but Ive run it up since to between five and six
It wasnt me she wanted as much aswell it was about like this She
had that bunch on her hands and they had to be taken care of Edith
married me two months after you did the groundsquirrel act I thought
she liked me too at the time

And now inquired the recluse

Were better friends than ever now She got a divorce from me two years
ago Just incompatibility I didnt put in any defence Well well
well Hamp this is certainly a funny dugout youve built here But you
always were a hero of fiction Seems like youd have been the very one
to strike Ediths fancy Maybe you didbut its the bankroll that
catches em my boyyour caves and whiskers wont do it Honestly
Hamp dont you think youve been a darned fool

The hermit smiled behind his tangled beard He was and always had been
so superior to the crude and mercenary Binkley that even his vulgarities
could not anger him Moreover his studies and meditations in his
retreat had raised him far above the little vanities of the world His
little mountainside had been almost an Olympus over the edge of which
he saw smiling the bolts hurled in the valleys of man below Had his
ten years of renunciation of thought of devotion to an ideal of
living scorn of a sordid world been in vain Up from the world had
come to him the youngest and beautifulestfairer than Edithone and
threeseventh times lovelier than the sevenyearsserved Rachel So the
hermit smiled in his beard

When Binkley had relieved the hermitage from the blot of his presence
and the first faint star showed above the pines the hermit got the can
of bakingpowder from his cupboard He still smiled behind his beard

There was a slight rustle in the doorway There stood Edith Carr with
all the added beauty and stateliness and noble bearing that ten years
had brought her

She was never one to chatter She looked at the hermit with her large
_thinking_ dark eyes The hermit stood still surprised into a pose as
motionless as her own Only his subconscious sense of the fitness of
things caused him to turn the bakingpowder can slowly in his hands
until its red label was hidden against his bosom

I am stopping at the inn said Edith in low but clear tones I heard
of you there I told myself that I _must_ see you I want to ask your
forgiveness I sold my happiness for money There were others to be
provided forbut that does not excuse me I just wanted to see you
and ask your forgiveness You have lived here ten years they tell me
cherishing my memory I was blind Hampton I could not see then that
all the money in the world cannot weigh in the scales against a faithful
heart Ifbut it is too late now of course

Her assertion was a question clothed as best it could be in a loving
womans pride But through the thin disguise the hermit saw easily
that his lady had come back to himif he chose He had won a golden
crownif it pleased him to take it The reward of his decade of
faithfulness was ready for his handif he desired to stretch it forth

For the space of one minute the old enchantment shone upon him with
a reflected radiance And then by turns he felt the manly sensations
of indignation at having been discarded and of repugnance at having
beenas it weresought again And last of allhow strange that it
should have come at lastthe paleblue vision of the beautifulest of
the Trenholme sisters illuminated his minds eye and left him without
a waver

It is too late he said in deep tones pressing the bakingpowder
can against his heart

Once she turned after she had gone slowly twenty yards down the path
The hermit had begun to twist the lid off his can but he hid it again
under his sacking robe He could see her great eyes shining sadly
through the twilight but he stood inflexible in the doorway of his
shack and made no sign



Just as the moon rose on Thursday evening the hermit was seized by the
worldmadness

Up from the inn fainter than the horns of elfland came now and then
a few bars of music played by the casino band The Hudson was broadened
by the night into an illimitable seathose lights dimly seen on its
opposite shore were not beacons for prosaic trolleylines but lowset
stars millions of miles away The waters in front of the inn were gay
with firefliesor were they motorboats smelling of gasoline and oil
Once the hermit had known these things and had sported with Amaryllis
in the shade of the redandwhitestriped awnings But for ten years
he had turned a heedless ear to these faroff echoes of a frivolous
world But tonight there was something wrong

The casino band was playing a waltza waltz What a fool he had
been to tear deliberately ten years of his life from the calendar
of existence for one who had given him up for the false joys that
wealth_tum_ ti _tum_ ti _tum_ tihow did that waltz go Butthose
years had not been sacrificedhad they not brought him the star and
pearl of all the world the youngest and beautifulest of

But do _not_ come on Thursday evening she had insisted Perhaps by
now she would be moving slowly and gracefully to the strains of that
waltz held closely by WestPointers or city commuters while he who
had read in her eyes things that had recompensed him for ten lost
years of life moped like some wild animal in its mountain den Why
should

Damn it said the hermit suddenly Ill do it

He threw down his Marcus Aurelius and threw off his gunnysack toga
He dragged a dustcovered trunk from a corner of the cave and with
difficulty wrenched open its lid

Candles he had in plenty and the cave was soon aglow Clothesten
years old in cutscissors razors hats shoes all his discarded
attire and belongings were dragged ruthlessly from their renunciatory
rest and strewn about in painful disorder

A pair of scissors soon reduced his beard sufficiently for the dulled
razors to perform approximately their office Cutting his own hair
was beyond the hermits skill So he only combed and brushed it
backward as smoothly as he could Charity forbids us to consider the
heartburnings and exertions of one so long removed from haberdashery
and society

At the last the hermit went to an inner corner of his cave and began
to dig in the soft earth with a long iron spoon Out of the cavity he
thus made he drew a tin can and out of the can three thousand dollars
in bills tightly rolled and wrapped in oiled silk He was a real
hermit as this may assure you

You may take a brief look at him as he hastens down the little
mountainside A long wrinkled black frockcoat reached to his
calves White duck trousers unacquainted with the tailors goose a
pink shirt white standing collar with brilliant blue butterfly tie
and buttoned congress gaiters But think sir and madamten years
From beneath a narrowbrimmed straw hat with a striped band flowed his
hair Seeing him with all your shrewdness you could not have guessed
him You would have said that he played Hamletor the tubaor
pinochleyou would never have laid your hand on your heart and said
He is a hermit who lived ten years in a cave for love of one ladyto
win another

The dancing pavilion extended above the waters of the river Gay
lanterns and frosted electric globes shed a soft glamour within it A
hundred ladies and gentlemen from the inn and summer cottages flitted
in and about it To the left of the dusty roadway down which the
hermit had tramped were the inn and grillroom Something seemed to
be on there too The windows were brilliantly lighted and music was
playingmusic different from the twosteps and waltzes of the casino
band

A negro man wearing a white jacket came through the iron gate with
its immense granite posts and wroughtiron lampholders

What is going on here tonight asked the hermit

Well sah said the servitor dey is having de reglar
Thursdayevenin dance in de casino And in de grillroom deres a
beefsteak dinner sah

The hermit glanced up at the inn on the hillside whence burst suddenly
a triumphant strain of splendid harmony

And up there said he they are playing Mendelssohnwhat is going
on up there

Up in de inn said the dusky one dey is a weddin goin on Mr
Binkley a mighty rich man am marryin Miss Trenholme sahde young
lady who am quite de belle of de place sah




HE ALSO SERVES



If I could have a thousand yearsjust one little thousand yearsmore
of life I might in that time draw near enough to true Romance to
touch the hem of her robe

Up from ships men come and from waste places and forest and road and
garret and cellar to maunder to me in strangely distributed words
of the things they have seen and considered The recording of their
tales is no more than a matter of ears and fingers There are only
two fates I dreaddeafness and writers cramp The hand is yet
steady let the ear bear the blame if these printed words be not in
the order they were delivered to me by Hunky Magee true campfollower
of fortune

Biography shall claim you but an instantI first knew Hunky when he
was headwaiter at Chubbs little beefsteak restaurant and cafe on
Third Avenue There was only one waiter besides

Then successively I caromed against him in the little streets of
the Big City after his trip to Alaska his voyage as cook with a
treasureseeking expedition to the Caribbean and his failure as a
pearlfisher in the Arkansas River Between these dashes into the land
of adventure he usually came back to Chubbs for a while Chubbs was
a port for him when gales blew too high but when you dined there and
Hunky went for your steak you never knew whether he would come to
anchor in the kitchen or in the Malayan Archipelago You wouldnt
care for his descriptionhe was soft of voice and hard of face
and rarely had to use more than one eye to quell any approach to a
disturbance among Chubbs customers

One night I found Hunky standing at a corner of Twentythird Street
and Third Avenue after an absence of several months In ten minutes
we had a little round table between us in a quiet corner and my
ears began to get busy I leave out my sly ruses and feints to draw
Hunkys wordofmouth blowsit all came to something like this

Speaking of the next election said Hunky did you ever know much
about Indians No I dont mean the Cooper Beadle cigarstore or
Laughing Water kindI mean the modern Indianthe kind that takes
Greek prizes in colleges and scalps the halfback on the other side
in football games The kind that eats macaroons and tea in the
afternoons with the daughter of the professor of biology and fills
up on grasshoppers and fried rattlesnake when they get back to the
ancestral wickiup

Well they aint so bad I like em better than most foreigners that
have come over in the last few hundred years One thing about the
Indian is this when he mixes with the white race he swaps all his own
vices for them of the palefacesand he retains all his own virtues
Well his virtues are enough to call out the reserves whenever he lets
em loose But the imported foreigners adopt our virtues and keep
their own vicesand its going to take our whole standing army some
day to police that gang

But let me tell you about the trip I took to Mexico with High Jack
Snakefeeder a Cherokee twice removed a graduate of a Pennsylvania
college and the latest thing in pointedtoed rubberheeled patent
kid moccasins and Madras huntingshirt with turnedback cuffs He was
a friend of mine I met him in Tahlequah when I was out there during
the land boom and we got thick He had got all there was out of
colleges and had come back to lead his people out of Egypt He was a
man of firstclass style and wrote essays and had been invited to
visit rich guys houses in Boston and such places

There was a Cherokee girl in Muscogee that High Jack was foolish
about He took me to see her a few times Her name was Florence Blue
Featherbut you want to clear your mind of all ideas of squaws with
noserings and army blankets This young lady was whiter than you
are and better educated than I ever was You couldnt have told her
from any of the girls shopping in the swell Third Avenue stores I
liked her so well that I got to calling on her now and then when High
Jack wasnt along which is the way of friends in such matters She
was educated at the Muscogee College and was making a specialty
oflets seeethyes ethnology Thats the art that goes back
and traces the descent of different races of people leading up from
jellyfish through monkeys and to the OBriens High Jack had took
up that line too and had read papers about it before all kinds of
riotous assembliesChautauquas and Choctaws and chowderparties and
such Having a mutual taste for musty information like that was what
made em like each other I suppose But I dont know What they
call congeniality of tastes aint always it Now when Miss Blue
Feather and me was talking together I listened to her affidavits
about the first families of the Land of Nod being cousins german
well if the Germans dont nod who does to the moundbuilders of
Ohio with incomprehension and respect And when Id tell her about
the Bowery and Coney Island and sing her a few songs that Id heard
the Jamaica niggers sing at their church lawnparties she didnt look
much less interested than she did when High Jack would tell her that
he had a pipe that the first inhabitants of America originally arrived
here on stilts after a freshet at Tenafly New Jersey

But I was going to tell you more about High Jack

About six months ago I get a letter from him saying hed been
commissioned by the Minority Report Bureau of Ethnology at Washington
to go down to Mexico and translate some excavations or dig up the
meaning of some shorthand notes on some ruinsor something of that
sort And if Id go along he could squeeze the price into the expense
account

Well Id been holding a napkin over my arm at Chubbs about long
enough then so I wired High Jack Yes and he sent me a ticket and
I met him in Washington and he had a lot of news to tell me First
of all was that Florence Blue Feather had suddenly disappeared from
her home and environments

Run away I asked

Vanished says High Jack Disappeared like your shadow when
the sun goes under a cloud She was seen on the street and then
she turned a corner and nobody ever seen her afterward The whole
community turned out to look for her but we never found a clew

Thats badthats bad says I She was a mighty nice girl and
as smart as you find em

High Jack seemed to take it hard I guess he must have esteemed Miss
Blue Feather quite highly I could see that hed referred the matter
to the whiskeyjug That was his weak pointand many another mans
Ive noticed that when a man loses a girl he generally takes to drink
either just before or just after it happens

From Washington we railroaded it to New Orleans and there took a
tramp steamer bound for Belize And a gale pounded us all down the
Caribbean and nearly wrecked us on the Yucatan coast opposite a
little town without a harbor called Boca de Coacoyula Suppose the
ship had run against that name in the dark

Better fifty years of Europe than a cyclone in the bay says High
Jack Snakefeeder So we get the captain to send us ashore in a dory
when the squall seemed to cease from squalling

We will find ruins here or make em says High The Government
doesnt care which we do An appropriation is an appropriation

Boca de Coacoyula was a dead town Them biblical towns we read
aboutTired and Siphonafter they was destroyed they must have
looked like Fortysecond Street and Broadway compared to this Boca
place It still claimed 1300 inhabitants as estimated and engraved
on the stone courthouse by the censustaker in 1597 The citizens
were a mixture of Indians and other Indians but some of em was
lightcolored which I was surprised to see The town was huddled up
on the shore with woods so thick around it that a subpoenaserver
couldnt have reached a monkey ten yards away with the papers We
wondered what kept it from being annexed to Kansas but we soon found
out that it was Major Bing

Major Bing was the ointment around the fly He had the cochineal
sarsaparilla logwood annatto hemp and all other dyewoods and
pure food adulteration concessions cornered He had fivesixths of
the Boca de Thingamajiggers working for him on shares It was a
beautiful graft We used to brag about Morgan and E H and others
of our wisest when I was in the provincesbut now no more That
peninsula has got our little country turned into a submarine without
even the observation tower showing

Major Bings idea was this He had the population go forth into the
forest and gather these products When they brought em in he gave
em onefifth for their trouble Sometimes theyd strike and demand a
sixth The Major always gave in to em

The Major had a bungalow so close on the sea that the nineinch
tide seeped through the cracks in the kitchen floor Me and him and
High Jack Snakefeeder sat on the porch and drank rum from noon till
midnight He said he had piled up 300000 in New Orleans banks and
High and me could stay with him forever if we would But High Jack
happened to think of the United States and began to talk ethnology

Ruins says Major Bing The woods are full of em I dont know
how far they date back but they was here before I came

High Jack asks what form of worship the citizens of that locality are
addicted to

Why says the Major rubbing his nose I cant hardly say I
imagine its infidel or Aztec or Nonconformist or something like
that Theres a church herea Methodist or some other kindwith
a parson named Skidder He claims to have converted the people to
Christianity He and me dont assimilate except on state occasions
I imagine they worship some kind of gods or idols yet But Skidder
says he has em in the fold

A few days later High Jack and me prowling around strikes a plain
path into the forest and follows it a good four miles Then a branch
turns to the left We go a mile maybe down that and run up against
the finest ruin you ever sawsolid stone with trees and vines and
underbrush all growing up against it and in it and through it All
over it was chiselled carvings of funny beasts and people that would
have been arrested if theyd ever come out in vaudeville that way We
approached it from the rear

High Jack had been drinking too much rum ever since we landed in
Boca You know how an Indian isthe palefaces fixed his clock when
they introduced him to firewater Hed brought a quart along with
him

Hunky says he well explore the ancient temple It may be that
the storm that landed us here was propitious The Minority Report
Bureau of Ethnology says he may yet profit by the vagaries of wind
and tide

We went in the rear door of the bum edifice We struck a kind of
alcove without bath There was a granite davenport and a stone
washstand without any soap or exit for the water and some hardwood
pegs drove into holes in the wall and that was all To go out of that
furnished apartment into a Harlem hall bedroom would make you feel
like getting back home from an amateur violoncello solo at an East
Side Settlement house

While High was examining some hieroglyphics on the wall that the
stonemasons must have made when their tools slipped I stepped into
the front room That was at least thirty by fifty feet stone floor
six little windows like square portholes that didnt let much light
in

I looked back over my shoulder and sees High Jacks face three feet
away

High says I of all the

And then I noticed he looked funny and I turned around

Hed taken off his clothes to the waist and he didnt seem to hear
me I touched him and came near beating it High Jack had turned to
stone I had been drinking some rum myself

Ossified I says to him loudly I knew what would happen if you
kept it up

And then High Jack comes in from the alcove when he hears me
conversing with nobody and we have a look at Mr Snakefeeder No 2
Its a stone idol or god or revised statute or something and it
looks as much like High Jack as one green pea looks like itself Its
got exactly his face and size and color but its steadier on its
pins It stands on a kind of rostrum or pedestal and you can see
its been there ten million years

Hes a cousin of mine sings High and then he turns solemn

Hunky he says putting one hand on my shoulder and one on the
statues Im in the holy temple of my ancestors

Well if looks goes for anything says I youve struck a twin
Stand side by side with buddy and lets see if theres any
difference

There wasnt You know an Indian can keep his face as still as an
iron dogs when he wants to so when High Jack froze his features you
couldnt have told him from the other one

Theres some letters says I on his nobs pedestal but I cant
make em out The alphabet of this country seems to be composed of
sometimes _a_ _e_ _i_ _o_ and _u_ but generally _zs_ _ls_
and _ts_

High Jacks ethnology gets the upper hand of his rum for a minute
and he investigates the inscription

Hunky says he this is a statue of Tlotopaxl one of the most
powerful gods of the ancient Aztecs

Glad to know him says I but in his present condition he reminds
me of the joke Shakespeare got off on Julius Caesar We might say
about your friend


 Imperious Whatshisname dead and turned to stone
 No use to write or call him on the phone


Hunky says High Jack Snakefeeder looking at me funny do you
believe in reincarnation

It sounds to me says I like either a cleanup of the
slaughterhouses or a new kind of Boston pink I dont know

I believe says he that I am the reincarnation of Tlotopaxl
My researches have convinced me that the Cherokees of all the North
American tribes can boast of the straightest descent from the
proud Aztec race That says he was a favorite theory of mine and
Florence Blue Feathers And shewhat if she

High Jack grabs my arm and walls his eyes at me Just then he looked
more like his eminent coIndian murderer Crazy Horse

Well says I what if she what if she what if she Youre
drunk says I Impersonating idols and believing inwhat was
itrecarnalization Lets have a drink says I Its as spooky here
as a Brooklyn artificiallimb factory at midnight with the gas turned
down

Just then I heard somebody coming and I dragged High Jack into the
bedless bedchamber There was peepholes bored through the wall so
we could see the whole front part of the temple Major Bing told me
afterward that the ancient priests in charge used to rubber through
them at the congregation

In a few minutes an old Indian woman came in with a big oval earthen
dish full of grub She set it on a square block of stone in front of
the graven image and laid down and walloped her face on the floor a
few times and then took a walk for herself

High Jack and me was hungry so we came out and looked it over
There was goat steaks and fried ricecakes and plantains and cassava
and broiled landcrabs and mangoesnothing like what you get at
Chubbs

We ate heartyand had another round of rum

It must be old Tecumsehsor whatever you call himbirthday says
I Or do they feed him every day I thought gods only drank vanilla
on Mount Catawampus

Then some more native parties in short kimonos that showed their
aboriginees punctured the nearhorizon and me and High had to skip
back into Father Axletrees private boudoir They came by ones twos
and threes and left all sorts of offeringsthere was enough grub
for Binghams nine gods of war with plenty left over for the Peace
Conference at The Hague They brought jars of honey and bunches of
bananas and bottles of wine and stacks of tortillas and beautiful
shawls worth one hundred dollars apiece that the Indian women weave of
a kind of vegetable fibre like silk All of em got down and wriggled
on the floor in front of that hardfinish god and then sneaked off
through the woods again

I wonder who gets this rakeoff remarks High Jack

Oh says I theres priests or deputy idols or a committee of
disarrangements somewhere in the woods on the job Wherever you
find a god youll find somebody waiting to take charge of the burnt
offerings

And then we took another swig of rum and walked out to the parlor
front door to cool off for it was as hot inside as a summer camp on
the Palisades

And while we stood there in the breeze we looks down the path and
sees a young lady approaching the blasted ruin She was barefooted
and had on a white robe and carried a wreath of white flowers in her
hand When she got nearer we saw she had a long blue feather stuck
through her black hair And when she got nearer still me and High
Jack Snakefeeder grabbed each other to keep from tumbling down on the
floor for the girls face was as much like Florence Blue Feathers
as his was like old King Toxicologys

And then was when High Jacks booze drowned his system of ethnology
He dragged me inside back of the statue and says

Lay hold of it Hunky Well pack it into the other room I felt
it all the time says he Im the reconsideration of the god
Locomotorataxia and Florence Blue Feather was my bride a thousand
years ago She has come to seek me in the temple where I used to
reign

All right says I Theres no use arguing against the rum
question You take his feet

We lifted the threehundredpound stone god and carried him into
the back room of the cafethe temple I meanand leaned him against
the wall It was more work than bouncing three live ones from an
allnight Broadway joint on NewYears Eve

Then High Jack ran out and brought in a couple of them Indian silk
shawls and began to undress himself

Oh figs says I Is it thus Strong drink is an adder and
subtractor too Is it the heat or the call of the wild thats got
you

But High Jack is too full of exaltation and canejuice to reply He
stops the disrobing business just short of the Manhattan Beach rules
and then winds them redandwhite shawls around him and goes out and
stands on the pedestal as steady as any platinum deity you ever saw
And I looks through a peekhole to see what he is up to

In a few minutes in comes the girl with the flower wreath Danged
if I wasnt knocked a little silly when she got close she looked
so exactly much like Florence Blue Feather I wonder says I to
myself if she has been reincarcerated too If I could see says I
to myself whether she has a mole on her left But the next minute
I thought she looked oneeighth of a shade darker than Florence but
she looked good at that And High Jack hadnt drunk all the rum that
had been drank

The girl went up within ten feet of the bum idol and got down and
massaged her nose with the floor like the rest did Then she went
nearer and laid the flower wreath on the block of stone at High Jacks
feet Rummy as I was I thought it was kind of nice of her to think
of offering flowers instead of household and kitchen provisions Even
a stone god ought to appreciate a little sentiment like that on top of
the fancy groceries they had piled up in front of him

And then High Jack steps down from his pedestal quiet and mentions
a few words that sounded just like the hieroglyphics carved on the
walls of the ruin The girl gives a little jump backward and her
eyes fly open as big as doughnuts but she dont beat it

Why didnt she Ill tell you why I think why It dont seem to a
girl so supernatural unlikely strange and startling that a stone
god should come to life for _her_ If he was to do it for one of them
snubnosed brown girls on the other side of the woods now it would
be differentbut _her_ Ill bet she said to herself Well goodness
me youve been a long time getting on your job Ive half a mind not
to speak to you

But she and High Jack holds hands and walks away out of the temple
together By the time Id had time to take another drink and enter
upon the scene they was twenty yards away going up the path in the
woods that the girl had come down With the natural scenery already
in place it was just like a play to watch emshe looking up at
him and him giving her back the best that an Indian can hand
out in the way of a googoo eye But there wasnt anything in that
recarnification and revulsion to tintype for me

Hey Injun I yells out to High Jack Weve got a boardbill due
in town and youre leaving me without a cent Brace up and cut out
the Neapolitan fishermaiden and lets go back home

But on the two goes without looking once back until as you might
say the forest swallowed em up And I never saw or heard of High
Jack Snakefeeder from that day to this I dont know if the Cherokees
came from the Aspics but if they did one of em went back

All I could do was to hustle back to that Boca place and panhandle
Major Bing He detached himself from enough of his winnings to buy me
a ticket home And Im back again on the job at Chubbs sir and Im
going to hold it steady Come round and youll find the steaks as
good as ever

I wondered what Hunky Magee thought about his own story so I asked
him if he had any theories about reincarnation and transmogrification
and such mysteries as he had touched upon

Nothing like that said Hunky positively What ailed High Jack
was too much booze and education Theyll do an Indian up every
time

But what about Miss Blue Feather I persisted

Say said Hunky with a grin that little lady that stole High Jack
certainly did give me a jar when I first took a look at her but it
was only for a minute You remember I told you High Jack said that
Miss Florence Blue Feather disappeared from home about a year ago
Well where she landed four days later was in as neat a fiveroom flat
on East Twentythird Street as you ever walked sideways throughand
shes been Mrs Magee ever since




THE MOMENT OF VICTORY


Ben Granger is a war veteran aged twentyninewhich should enable
you to guess the war He is also principal merchant and postmaster of
Cadiz a little town over which the breezes from the Gulf of Mexico
perpetually blow

Ben helped to hurl the Don from his stronghold in the Greater
Antilles and then hiking across half the world he marched as a
corporalusher up and down the blazing tropic aisles of the openair
college in which the Filipino was schooled Now with his bayonet
beaten into a cheeseslicer he rallies his corporals guard of
cronies in the shade of his wellwhittled porch instead of in the
matted jungles of Mindanao Always have his interest and choice been
for deeds rather than for words but the consideration and digestion
of motives is not beyond him as this story which is his will
attest

What is it he asked me one moonlit eve as we sat among his boxes
and barrels that generally makes men go through dangers and fire
and trouble and starvation and battle and such recourses What
does a man do it for Why does he try to outdo his fellowhumans and
be braver and stronger and more daring and showy than even his best
friends are Whats his game What does he expect to get out of it
He dont do it just for the fresh air and exercise What would you
say now Bill that an ordinary man expects generally speaking for
his efforts along the line of ambition and extraordinary hustling in
the marketplaces forums shootinggalleries lyceums battlefields
links cinderpaths and arenas of the civilized and _vice versa_
places of the world

Well Ben said I with judicial seriousness I think we might
safely limit the number of motives of a man who seeks fame to threeto
ambition which is a desire for popular applause to avarice which
looks to the material side of success and to love of some woman whom
he either possesses or desires to possess

Ben pondered over my words while a mockingbird on the top of a
mesquite by the porch trilled a dozen bars

I reckon said he that your diagnosis about covers the case
according to the rules laid down in the copybooks and historical
readers But what I had in my mind was the case of Willie Robbins a
person I used to know Ill tell you about him before I close up the
store if you dont mind listening

Willie was one of our social set up in San Augustine I was clerking
there then for Brady  Murchison wholesale drygoods and ranch
supplies Willie and I belonged to the same german club and athletic
association and military company He played the triangle in our
serenading and quartet crowd that used to ring the welkin three nights
a week somewhere in town

Willie jibed with his name considerable He weighed about as much
as a hundred pounds of veal in his summer suitings and he had a
WhereisMary expression on his features so plain that you could
almost see the wool growing on him

And yet you couldnt fence him away from the girls with barbed wire
You know that kind of young fellowsa kind of a mixture of fools and
angelsthey rush in and fear to tread at the same time but they never
fail to tread when they get the chance He was always on hand when a
joyful occasion was had as the morning paper would say looking as
happy as a king full and at the same time as uncomfortable as a raw
oyster served with sweet pickles He danced like he had hind hobbles
on and he had a vocabulary of about three hundred and fifty words
that he made stretch over four germans a week and plagiarized from
to get him through two icecream suppers and a Sundaynight call He
seemed to me to be a sort of a mixture of Maltese kitten sensitive
plant and a member of a stranded Two Orphans company

Ill give you an estimate of his physiological and pictorial makeup
and then Ill stick spurs into the sides of my narrative

Willie inclined to the Caucasian in his coloring and manner of style
His hair was opalescent and his conversation fragmentary His eyes
were the same blue shade as the china dogs on the righthand corner
of your Aunt Ellens mantelpiece He took things as they came and I
never felt any hostility against him I let him live and so did
others

But what does this Willie do but coax his heart out of his boots and
lose it to Myra Allison the liveliest brightest keenest smartest
and prettiest girl in San Augustine I tell you she had the blackest
eyes the shiniest curls and the most tantalizingOh no youre
offI wasnt a victim I might have been but I knew better I kept
out Joe Granberry was It from the start He had everybody else
beat a couple of leagues and thence east to a stake and mound But
anyhow Myra was a ninepound fullmerino fallclip fleece sacked
and loaded on a fourhorse team for San Antone

One night there was an icecream sociable at Mrs Colonel
Spraggins in San Augustine We fellows had a big room upstairs
opened up for us to put our hats and things in and to comb our hair
and put on the clean collars we brought along inside the sweatbands
of our hatsin short a room to fix up in just like they have
everywhere at hightoned doings A little farther down the hall
was the girls room which they used to powder up in and so forth
Downstairs wethat is the San Augustine Social Cotillion and
Merrymakers Clubhad a stretcher put down in the parlor where our
dance was going on

Willie Robbins and me happened to be up in ourcloakroom I believe
we called itwhen Myra Allison skipped through the hall on her way
downstairs from the girls room Willie was standing before the
mirror deeply interested in smoothing down the blond grassplot on
his head which seemed to give him lots of trouble Myra was always
full of life and devilment She stopped and stuck her head in our
door She certainly was goodlooking But I knew how Joe Granberry
stood with her So did Willie but he kept on baaaing after her
and following her around He had a system of persistence that didnt
coincide with pale hair and light eyes

Hello Willie says Myra What are you doing to yourself in the
glass

Im trying to look fly says Willie

Well you never could _be_ fly says Myra with her special laugh
which was the provokingest sound I ever heard except the rattle of an
empty canteen against my saddlehorn

I looked around at Willie after Myra had gone He had a kind of a
lilywhite look on him which seemed to show that her remark had as
you might say disrupted his soul I never noticed anything in what
she said that sounded particularly destructive to a mans ideas
of selfconsciousness but he was set back to an extent you could
scarcely imagine

After we went downstairs with our clean collars on Willie never
went near Myra again that night After all he seemed to be a diluted
kind of a skimmilk sort of a chap and I never wondered that Joe
Granberry beat him out

The next day the battleship _Maine_ was blown up and then pretty soon
somebodyI reckon it was Joe Bailey or Ben Tillman or maybe the
Governmentdeclared war against Spain

Well everybody south of Mason  Hamlins line knew that the North
by itself couldnt whip a whole country the size of Spain So the
Yankees commenced to holler for help and the Johnny Rebs answered the
call Were coming Father William a hundred thousand strongand
then some was the way they sang it And the old party lines drawn
by Shermans march and the Kuklux and ninecent cotton and the Jim
Crow streetcar ordinances faded away We became one undivided
country with no North very little East a goodsized chunk of West
and a South that loomed up as big as the first foreign label on a new
eightdollar suitcase

Of course the dogs of war werent a complete pack without a yelp from
the San Augustine Rifles Company D of the Fourteenth Texas Regiment
Our company was among the first to land in Cuba and strike terror
into the hearts of the foe Im not going to give you a history of
the war Im just dragging it in to fill out my story about Willie
Robbins just as the Republican party dragged it in to help out the
election in 1898

If anybody ever had heroitis it was that Willie Robbins From the
minute he set foot on the soil of the tyrants of Castile he seemed to
engulf danger as a cat laps up cream He certainly astonished every
man in our company from the captain up Youd have expected him
to gravitate naturally to the job of an orderly to the colonel or
typewriter in the commissarybut not any He created the part of
the flaxenhaired boy hero who lives and gets back home with the
goods instead of dying with an important despatch in his hands at
his colonels feet

Our company got into a section of Cuban scenery where one of the
messiest and most unsung portions of the campaign occurred We were
out every day capering around in the bushes and having little
skirmishes with the Spanish troops that looked more like kind of
tiredout feuds than anything else The war was a joke to us and
of no interest to them We never could see it any other way than as
a howling farcecomedy that the San Augustine Rifles were actually
fighting to uphold the Stars and Stripes And the blamed little
senors didnt get enough pay to make them care whether they were
patriots or traitors Now and then somebody would get killed It
seemed like a waste of life to me I was at Coney Island when I went
to New York once and one of them downhill skidding apparatuses they
call rollercoasters flew the track and killed a man in a brown
sacksuit Whenever the Spaniards shot one of our men it struck me
as just about as unnecessary and regrettable as that was

But Im dropping Willie Robbins out of the conversation

He was out for bloodshed laurels ambition medals recommendations
and all other forms of military glory And he didnt seem to be
afraid of any of the recognized forms of military danger such as
Spaniards cannonballs canned beef gunpowder or nepotism He went
forth with his pallid hair and chinablue eyes and ate up Spaniards
like you would sardines _a la canopy_ Wars and rumbles of wars never
flustered him He would stand guardduty mosquitoes hardtack
treat and fire with equally perfect unanimity No blondes in history
ever come in comparison distance of him except the Jack of Diamonds
and Queen Catherine of Russia

I remember one time a little _caballard_ of Spanish men sauntered
out from behind a patch of sugarcane and shot Bob Turner the first
sergeant of our company while we were eating dinner As required
by the army regulations we fellows went through the usual tactics
of falling into line saluting the enemy and loading and firing
kneeling

That wasnt the Texas way of scrapping but being a very important
addendum and annex to the regular army the San Augustine Rifles had
to conform to the redtape system of getting even

By the time we had got out our Uptons Tactics turned to page
fiftyseven said onetwothreeonetwothree a couple of
times and got blank cartridges into our Springfields the Spanish
outfit had smiled repeatedly rolled and lit cigarettes by squads and
walked away contemptuously

I went straight to Captain Floyd and says to him Sam I dont
think this war is a straight game You know as well as I do that Bob
Turner was one of the whitest fellows that ever threw a leg over a
saddle and now these wirepullers in Washington have fixed his clock
Hes politically and ostensibly dead It aint fair Why should they
keep this thing up If they want Spain licked why dont they turn
the San Augustine Rifles and Joe Seelys ranger company and a carload
of West Texas deputysheriffs onto these Spaniards and let us
exonerate them from the face of the earth I never did says I
care much about fighting by the Lord Chesterfield ring rules Im
going to hand in my resignation and go home if anybody else I am
personally acquainted with gets hurt in this war If you can get
somebody in my place Sam says I Ill quit the first of next week
I dont want to work in an army that dont give its help a chance
Never mind my wages says I let the Secretary of the Treasury keep
em

Well Ben says the captain to me your allegations and estimations
of the tactics of war government patriotism guardmounting
and democracy are all right But Ive looked into the system of
international arbitration and the ethics of justifiable slaughter
a little closer maybe than you have Now you can hand in your
resignation the first of next week if you are so minded But if you
do says Sam Ill order a corporals guard to take you over by
that limestone bluff on the creek and shoot enough lead into you to
ballast a submarine airship Im captain of this company and Ive
swore allegiance to the Amalgamated States regardless of sectional
secessional and Congressional differences Have you got any
smokingtobacco winds up Sam Mine got wet when I swum the creek
this morning

The reason I drag all this _non ex parte_ evidence in is because Willie
Robbins was standing there listening to us I was a second sergeant
and he was a private then but among us Texans and Westerners there
never was as much tactics and subordination as there was in the
regular army We never called our captain anything but Sam except
when there was a lot of majorgenerals and admirals around so as to
preserve the discipline

And says Willie Robbins to me in a sharp construction of voice much
unbecoming to his light hair and previous record

You ought to be shot Ben for emitting any such sentiments A man
that wont fight for his country is worse than a horsethief If I
was the cap Id put you in the guardhouse for thirty days on round
steak and tamales War says Willie is great and glorious I
didnt know you were a coward

Im not says I If I was Id knock some of the pallidness off
of your marble brow Im lenient with you I says just as I am
with the Spaniards because you have always reminded me of something
with mushrooms on the side Why you little Lady of Shalott says I
you underdone leader of cotillions you glassy fashion and moulded
form you whitepine soldier made in the Cisalpine Alps in Germany
for the late NewYear trade do you know of whom you are talking
to Weve been in the same social circle says I and Ive put
up with you because you seemed so meek and selfunsatisfying I
dont understand why you have so sudden taken a personal interest
in chivalrousness and murder Your natures undergone a complete
revelation Now how is it

Well you wouldnt understand Ben says Willie giving one of his
refined smiles and turning away

Come back here says I catching him by the tail of his khaki coat
Youve made me kind of mad in spite of the aloofness in which I have
heretofore held you You are out for making a success in this hero
business and I believe I know what for You are doing it either
because you are crazy or because you expect to catch some girl by it
Now if its a girl Ive got something here to show you

I wouldnt have done it but I was plumb mad I pulled a San
Augustine paper out of my hippocket and showed him an item It was
a half a column about the marriage of Myra Allison and Joe Granberry

Willie laughed and I saw I hadnt touched him

Oh says he everybody knew that was going to happen I heard
about that a week ago And then he gave me the laugh again

All right says I Then why do you so recklessly chase the bright
rainbow of fame Do you expect to be elected President or do you
belong to a suicide club

And then Captain Sam interferes

You gentlemen quit jawing and go back to your quarters says he
or Ill have you escorted to the guardhouse Now scat both of
you Before you go which one of you has got any chewingtobacco

Were off Sam says I Its suppertime anyhow But what do
you think of what we was talking about Ive noticed you throwing out
a good many grapplinghooks for this here balloon called fameWhats
ambition anyhow What does a man risk his life day after day for
Do you know of anything he gets in the end that can pay him for the
trouble I want to go back home says I I dont care whether Cuba
sinks or swims and I dont give a pipeful of rabbit tobacco whether
Queen Sophia Christina or Charlie Culberson rules these fairy isles
and I dont want my name on any list except the list of survivors
But Ive noticed you Sam says I seeking the bubble notoriety in
the cannons larynx a number of times Now what do you do it for Is
it ambition business or some frecklefaced Phoebe at home that you
are heroing for

Well Ben says Sam kind of hefting his sword out from between
his knees as your superior officer I could courtmartial you for
attempted cowardice and desertion But I wont And Ill tell you
why Im trying for promotion and the usual honors of war and conquest
A major gets more pay than a captain and I need the money

Correct for you says I I can understand that Your system of
fameseeking is rooted in the deepest soil of patriotism But I cant
comprehend says I why Willie Robbins whose folks at home are well
off and who used to be as meek and undesirous of notice as a cat with
cream on his whiskers should all at once develop into a warrior bold
with the most fireeating kind of proclivities And the girl in his
case seems to have been eliminated by marriage to another fellow I
reckon says I its a plain case of just common ambition He wants
his name maybe to go thundering down the coroners of time It must
be that

Well without itemizing his deeds Willie sure made good as a hero
He simply spent most of his time on his knees begging our captain to
send him on forlorn hopes and dangerous scouting expeditions In
every fight he was the first man to mix it at close quarters with the
Don Alfonsos He got three or four bullets planted in various parts
of his autonomy Once he went off with a detail of eight men and
captured a whole company of Spanish He kept Captain Floyd busy
writing out recommendations of his bravery to send in to headquarters
and he began to accumulate medals for all kinds of thingsheroism
and targetshooting and valor and tactics and uninsubordination and
all the little accomplishments that look good to the third assistant
secretaries of the War Department

Finally Cap Floyd got promoted to be a majorgeneral or a knight
commander of the main herd or something like that He pounded around
on a white horse all desecrated up with goldleaf and henfeathers
and a Good Templars hat and wasnt allowed by the regulations to
speak to us And Willie Robbins was made captain of our company

And maybe he didnt go after the wreath of fame then As far as
I could see it was him that ended the war He got eighteen of us
boysfriends of his tookilled in battles that he stirred up
himself and that didnt seem to me necessary at all One night he took
twelve of us and waded through a little rill about a hundred and ninety
yards wide and climbed a couple of mountains and sneaked through a
mile of neglected shrubbery and a couple of rockquarries and into a
ryestraw village and captured a Spanish general named as they said
Benny Veedus Benny seemed to me hardly worth the trouble being a
blackish man without shoes or cuffs and anxious to surrender and throw
himself on the commissary of his foe

But that job gave Willie the big boost he wanted The San Augustine
_News_ and the Galveston St Louis New York and Kansas City papers
printed his picture and columns of stuff about him Old San Augustine
simply went crazy over its gallant son The _News_ had an editorial
tearfully begging the Government to call off the regular army and
the national guard and let Willie carry on the rest of the war
singlehanded It said that a refusal to do so would be regarded as a
proof that the Northern jealousy of the South was still as rampant as
ever

If the war hadnt ended pretty soon I dont know to what heights of
gold braid and encomiums Willie would have climbed but it did There
was a secession of hostilities just three days after he was appointed
a colonel and got in three more medals by registered mail and shot
two Spaniards while they were drinking lemonade in an ambuscade

Our company went back to San Augustine when the war was over There
wasnt anywhere else for it to go And what do you think The old
town notified us in print by wire cable special delivery and a
nigger named Saul sent on a gray mule to San Antone that they was
going to give us the biggest blowout complimentary alimentary and
elementary that ever disturbed the kildees on the sandflats outside
of the immediate contiguity of the city

I say we but it was all meant for exPrivate Captain _de facto_
and Colonelelect Willie Robbins The town was crazy about him They
notified us that the reception they were going to put up would make
the Mardi Gras in New Orleans look like an afternoon tea in Bury St
Edmunds with a curates aunt

Well the San Augustine Rifles got back home on schedule time
Everybody was at the depot giving forth RooseveltDemocratthey
used to be called Rebelyells There was two brassbands and the
mayor and schoolgirls in white frightening the streetcar horses by
throwing Cherokee roses in the streets andwell maybe youve seen
a celebration by a town that was inland and out of water

They wanted BrevetColonel Willie to get into a carriage and be drawn
by prominent citizens and some of the city aldermen to the armory but
he stuck to his company and marched at the head of it up Sam Houston
Avenue The buildings on both sides was covered with flags and
audiences and everybody hollered Robbins or Hello Willie as
we marched up in files of fours I never saw a illustriouserlooking
human in my life than Willie was He had at least seven or eight
medals and diplomas and decorations on the breast of his khaki coat
he was sunburnt the color of a saddle and he certainly done himself
proud

They told us at the depot that the courthouse was to be illuminated
at halfpast seven and there would be speeches and chiliconcarne at
the Palace Hotel Miss Delphine Thompson was to read an original poem
by James Whitcomb Ryan and Constable Hooker had promised us a salute
of nine guns from Chicago that he had arrested that day

After we had disbanded in the armory Willie says to me

Want to walk out a piece with me

Why yes says I if it aint so far that we cant hear the tumult
and the shouting die away Im hungry myself says I and Im
pining for some home grub but Ill go with you

Willie steered me down some side streets till we came to a little
white cottage in a new lot with a twentybythirtyfoot lawn decorated
with brickbats and old barrelstaves

Halt and give the countersign says I to Willie Dont you know
this dugout Its the birdsnest that Joe Granberry built before he
married Myra Allison What you going there for

But Willie already had the gate open He walked up the brick walk to
the steps and I went with him Myra was sitting in a rockingchair
on the porch sewing Her hair was smoothed back kind of hasty and
tied in a knot I never noticed till then that she had freckles Joe
was at one side of the porch in his shirtsleeves with no collar
on and no signs of a shave trying to scrape out a hole among the
brickbats and tin cans to plant a little fruittree in He looked up
but never said a word and neither did Myra

Willie was sure dandylooking in his uniform with medals strung on
his breast and his new goldhandled sword Youd never have taken him
for the little whiteheaded snipe that the girls used to order about
and make fun of He just stood there for a minute looking at Myra
with a peculiar little smile on his face and then he says to her
slow and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth

_Oh I dont know Maybe I could if I tried_

That was all that was said Willie raised his hat and we walked
away

And somehow when he said that I remembered all of a sudden
the night of that dance and Willie brushing his hair before the
lookingglass and Myra sticking her head in the door to guy him

When we got back to Sam Houston Avenue Willie says

Well so long Ben Im going down home and get off my shoes and
take a rest

You says I Whats the matter with you Aint the courthouse
jammed with everybody in town waiting to honor the hero And two
brassbands and recitations and flags and jags and grub to follow
waiting for you

Willie sighs

All right Ben says he Darned if I didnt forget all about
that

And thats why I say concluded Ben Granger that you cant tell
where ambition begins any more than you can where it is going to wind
up




THE HEADHUNTER


When the war between Spain and George Dewey was over I went to the
Philippine Islands There I remained as bushwhacker correspondent
for my paper until its managing editor notified me that an
eighthundredword cablegram describing the grief of a pet carabao
over the death of an infant Moro was not considered by the office to
be war news So I resigned and came home

On board the tradingvessel that brought me back I pondered much
upon the strange things I had sensed in the weird archipelago of the
yellowbrown people The manoeuvres and skirmishings of the petty war
interested me not I was spellbound by the outlandish and unreadable
countenance of that race that had turned its expressionless gaze upon
us out of an unguessable past

Particularly during my stay in Mindanao had I been fascinated and
attracted by that delightfully original tribe of heathen known as
the headhunters Those grim flinty relentless little men never
seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their
concealed presence paralleling the trail of their prey through
unmapped forests across perilous mountaintops adown bottomless
chasms into uninhabitable jungles always near with the invisible
hand of death uplifted betraying their pursuit only by such signs as
a beast or a bird or a gliding serpent might makea twig crackling
in the awful sweatsoaked night a drench of dew showering from the
screening foliage of a giant tree a whisper at even from the rushes
of a waterlevela hint of death for every mile and every hourthey
amused me greatly those little fellows of one idea

When you think of it their method is beautifully and almost
hilariously effective and simple

You have your hut in which you live and carry out the destiny that
was decreed for you Spiked to the jamb of your bamboo doorway is a
basket made of green withes plaited From time to time as vanity or
ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move you you creep forth
with your snickersnee and take up the silent trail Back from it you
come triumphant bearing the severed gory head of your victim which
you deposit with pardonable pride in the basket at the side of your
door It may be the head of your enemy your friend or a stranger
according as competition jealousy or simple sportiveness has been
your incentive to labor

In any case your reward is certain The village men in passing
stop to congratulate you as your neighbor on weaker planes of life
stops to admire and praise the begonias in your front yard Your
particular brown maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft
tigers eyes at the evidence of your love for her You chew betelnut
and listen content to the intermittent soft drip from the ends of
the severed neck arteries And you show your teeth and grunt like a
waterbuffalowhich is as near as you can come to laughingat the
thought that the cold acephalous body of your door ornament is being
spotted by wheeling vultures in the Mindanaoan wilds

Truly the life of the merry headhunter captivated me He had
reduced art and philosophy to a simple code To take your adversarys
head to basket it at the portal of your castle to see it lying
there a dead thing with its cunning and stratagems and power gone
Is there a better way to foil his plots to refute his arguments to
establish your superiority over his skill and wisdom

The ship that brought me home was captained by an erratic Swede who
changed his course and deposited me with genuine compassion in
a small town on the Pacific coast of one of the Central American
republics a few hundred miles south of the port to which he had
engaged to convey me But I was wearied of movement and exotic
fancies so I leaped contentedly upon the firm sands of the village of
Mojada telling myself I should be sure to find there the rest that I
craved After all far better to linger there I thought lulled by
the sedative plash of the waves and the rustling of palmfronds than
to sit upon the horsehair sofa of my parental home in the East and
there cast down by currant wine and cake and scourged by fatuous
relatives drivel into the ears of gaping neighbors sad stories of the
death of colonial governors



When I first saw Chloe Greene she was standing all in white in the
doorway of her fathers tileroofed dobe house She was polishing
a silver cup with a cloth and she looked like a pearl laid against
black velvet She turned on me a flatteringly protracted but a
wiltingly disapproving gaze and then went inside humming a light
song to indicate the value she placed upon my existence

Small wonder for Dr Stamford the most disreputable professional
man between Juneau and Valparaiso and I were zigzagging along the
turfy street tunelessly singing the words of Auld Lang Syne to the
air of Muzzers Little CoalBlack Coon We had come from the ice
factory which was Mojadas palace of wickedness where we had been
playing billiards and opening black bottles white with frost that
we dragged with strings out of old Sandovals icecold vats

I turned in sudden rage to Dr Stamford as sober as the verger of a
cathedral In a moment I had become aware that we were swine cast
before a pearl

You beast I said this is half your doing And the other half
is the fault of this cursed country Id better have gone back to
Sleepytown and died in a wild orgy of currant wine and buns than to
have had this happen

Stamford filled the empty street with his roaring laughter

You too he cried And all as quick as the popping of a cork
Well she does seem to strike agreeably upon the retina But dont
burn your fingers All Mojada will tell you that Louis Devoe is the
man

We will see about that said I And perhaps whether he is _a_
man as well as _the_ man

I lost no time in meeting Louis Devoe That was easily accomplished
for the foreign colony in Mojada numbered scarce a dozen and they
gathered daily at a halfdecent hotel kept by a Turk where they
managed to patch together the fluttering rags of country and
civilization that were left them I sought Devoe before I did my
pearl of the doorway because I had learned a little of the game of
war and knew better than to strike for a prize before testing the
strength of the enemy

A sort of cold dismaysomething akin to fearfilled me when I had
estimated him I found a man so perfectly poised so charming so
deeply learned in the worlds rituals so full of tact courtesy and
hospitality so endowed with grace and ease and a kind of careless
haughty power that I almost overstepped the bounds in probing him in
turning him on the spit to find the weak point that I so craved for
him to have But I left him wholeI had to make bitter acknowledgment
to myself that Louis Devoe was a gentleman worthy of my best blows
and I swore to give him them He was a great merchant of the country
a wealthy importer and exporter All day he sat in a fastidiously
appointed office surrounded by works of art and evidences of his high
culture directing through glass doors and windows the affairs of his
house

In person he was slender and hardly tall His small wellshaped head
was covered with thick brown hair trimmed short and he wore a
thick brown beard also cut close and to a fine point His manners
were a pattern

Before long I had become a regular and a welcome visitor at the
Greene home I shook my wild habits from me like a wornout cloak
I trained for the conflict with the care of a prizefighter and the
selfdenial of a Brahmin

As for Chloe Greene I shall weary you with no sonnets to her eyebrow
She was a splendidly feminine girl as wholesome as a November pippin
and no more mysterious than a windowpane She had whimsical little
theories that she had deduced from life and that fitted the maxims
of Epictetus like princess gowns I wonder after all if that old
duffer wasnt rather wise

Chloe had a father the Reverend Homer Greene and an intermittent
mother who sometimes palely presided over a twilight teapot The
Reverend Homer was a burrlike man with a lifework He was writing
a concordance to the Scriptures and had arrived as far as Kings
Being presumably a suitor for his daughters hand I was timber for
his literary outpourings I had the family tree of Israel drilled
into my head until I used to cry aloud in my sleep And Aminadab
begat Jay Eye See and so forth until he had tackled another book
I once made a calculation that the Reverend Homers concordance would
be worked up as far as the Seven Vials mentioned in Revelations about
the third day after they were opened

Louis Devoe as well as I was a visitor and an intimate friend of the
Greenes It was there I met him the oftenest and a more agreeable
man or a more accomplished I have never hated in my life

Luckily or unfortunately I came to be accepted as a Boy My
appearance was youthful and I suppose I had that pleading and
homeless air that always draws the motherliness that is in women and
the cursed theories and hobbies of paterfamilias

Chloe called me Tommy and made sisterly fun of my attempts to
woo her With Devoe she was vastly more reserved He was the man of
romance one to stir her imagination and deepest feelings had her
fancy leaned toward him I was closer to her but standing in no
glamour I had the task before me of winning her in what seems to me
the American way of fightingwith cleanness and pluck and everyday
devotion to break away the barriers of friendship that divided us and
to take her if I could between sunrise and dark abetted by neither
moonlight nor music nor foreign wiles

Chloe gave no sign of bestowing her blithe affections upon either of
us But one day she let out to me an inkling of what she preferred
in a man It was tremendously interesting to me but not illuminating
as to its application I had been tormenting her for the dozenth time
with the statement and catalogue of my sentiments toward her

Tommy said she I dont want a man to show his love for me by
leading an army against another country and blowing people off the
earth with cannons

If you mean that the opposite way I answered as they say women
do Ill see what I can do The papers are full of this diplomatic
row in Russia My people know some big people in Washington who are
right next to the army people and I could get an artillery commission
and

Im not that way interrupted Chloe I mean what I say It isnt
the big things that are done in the world Tommy that count with a
woman When the knights were riding abroad in their armor to slay
dragons many a stayathome page won a lonesome ladys hand by being
on the spot to pick up her glove and be quick with her cloak when the
wind blew The man I am to like best whoever he shall be must show
his love in little ways He must never forget after hearing it once
that I do not like to have any one walk at my left side that I detest
brightcolored neckties that I prefer to sit with my back to a light
that I like candied violets that I must not be talked to when I am
looking at the moonlight shining on water and that I very very often
long for dates stuffed with English walnuts

Frivolity I said with a frown Any welltrained servant would be
equal to such details

And he must remember went on Chloe to remind me of what I want
when I do not know myself what I want

Youre rising in the scale I said What you seem to need is a
firstclass clairvoyant

And if I say that I am dying to hear a Beethoven sonata and stamp my
foot when I say it he must know by that that what my soul craves is
salted almonds and he will have them ready in his pocket

Now said I I am at a loss I do not know whether your souls
affinity is to be an impresario or a fancy grocer

Chloe turned her pearly smile upon me

Take less than half of what I said as a jest she went on And
dont think too lightly of the little things Boy Be a paladin if
you must but dont let it show on you Most women are only very big
children and most men are only very little ones Please us dont
try to overpower us When we want a hero we can make one out of even
a plain grocer the third time he catches our handkerchief before it
falls to the ground

That evening I was taken down with pernicious fever That is a kind
of coast fever with improvements and highgeared attachments Your
temperature goes up among the threes and fours and remains there
laughing scornfully and feverishly at the cinchona trees and the
coaltar derivatives Pernicious fever is a case for a simple
mathematician instead of a doctor It is merely this formula
Vitality  the desire to live  the duration of the fever  the
result

I took to my bed in the tworoomed thatched hut where I had been
comfortably established and sent for a gallon of rum That was not
for myself Drunk Stamford was the best doctor between the Andes
and the Pacific He came sat at my bedside and drank himself into
condition

My boy said he my lilywhite and reformed Romeo medicine will do
you no good But I will give you quinine which being bitter will
arouse in you hatred and angertwo stimulants that will add ten per
cent to your chances You are as strong as a caribou calf and you
will get well if the fever doesnt get in a knockout blow when youre
off your guard

For two weeks I lay on my back feeling like a Hindoo widow on a
burning ghat Old Atasca an untrained Indian nurse sat near the
door like a petrified statue of WhatstheUse attending to her
duties which were mainly to see that time went by without slipping
a cog Sometimes I would fancy myself back in the Philippines or at
worse times sliding off the horsehair sofa in Sleepytown

One afternoon I ordered Atasca to vamose and got up and dressed
carefully I took my temperature which I was pleased to find 104
I paid almost dainty attention to my dress choosing solicitously
a necktie of a dull and subdued hue The mirror showed that I was
looking little the worse from my illness The fever gave brightness
to my eyes and color to my face And while I looked at my reflection
my color went and came again as I thought of Chloe Greene and the
millions of eons that had passed since Id seen her and of Louis
Devoe and the time he had gained on me

I went straight to her house I seemed to float rather than walk I
hardly felt the ground under my feet I thought pernicious fever must
be a great boon to make one feel so strong

I found Chloe and Louis Devoe sitting under the awning in front of the
house She jumped up and met me with a double handshake

Im glad glad glad to see you out again she cried every word a
pearl strung on the string of her sentence You are well Tommyor
better of course I wanted to come to see you but they wouldnt let
me

Oh yes said I carelessly it was nothing Merely a little fever
I am out again as you see

We three sat there and talked for half an hour or so Then Chloe
looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean I could
see in her seablue eyes some deep and intense desire Devoe curse
him saw it too

What is it we asked in unison

Cocoanutpudding said Chloe pathetically Ive wanted someoh
so badly for two days Its got beyond a wish its an obsession

The cocoanut season is over said Devoe in that voice of his that
gave thrilling interest to his most commonplace words I hardly
think one could be found in Mojada The natives never use them except
when they are green and the milk is fresh They sell all the ripe
ones to the fruiterers

Wouldnt a broiled lobster or a Welsh rabbit do as well I remarked
with the engaging idiocy of a perniciousfever convalescent

Chloe came as near to pouting as a sweet disposition and a perfect
profile would allow her to come

The Reverend Homer poked his erminelined face through the doorway and
added a concordance to the conversation

Sometimes said he old Campos keeps the dried nuts in his little
store on the hill But it would be far better my daughter to
restrain unusual desires and partake thankfully of the daily dishes
that the Lord has set before us

Stuff said I

How was that asked the Reverend Homer sharply

I say its tough said I to drop into the vernacular that Miss
Greene should be deprived of the food she desiresa simple thing like
kalsominepudding Perhaps I continued solicitously some pickled
walnuts or a fricassee of Hungarian butternuts would do as well

Every one looked at me with a slight exhibition of curiosity

Louis Devoe arose and made his adieus I watched him until he had
sauntered slowly and grandiosely to the corner around which he turned
to reach his great warehouse and store Chloe made her excuses and
went inside for a few minutes to attend to some detail affecting the
sevenoclock dinner She was a passed mistress in housekeeping I
had tasted her puddings and bread with beatitude

When all had gone I turned casually and saw a basket made of
plaited green withes hanging by a nail outside the doorjamb With
a rush that made my hot temples throb there came vividly to my mind
recollections of the headhunters_those grim flinty relentless
little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the
subtle terror of their concealed presence    From time to time
as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move him
one creeps forth with his snickersnee and takes up the silent
trail    Back he comes triumphant bearing the severed gory head
of his victim    His particular brown or white maid lingers with
fluttering bosom casting soft tigers eyes at the evidence of his
love for her_

I stole softly from the house and returned to my hut From its
supporting nails in the wall I took a machete as heavy as a butchers
cleaver and sharper than a safetyrazor And then I chuckled softly
to myself and set out to the fastidiously appointed private office of
Monsieur Louis Devoe usurper to the hand of the Pearl of the Pacific

He was never slow at thinking he gave one look at my face and another
at the weapon in my hand as I entered his door and then he seemed
to fade from my sight I ran to the back door kicked it open and
saw him running like a deer up the road toward the wood that began
two hundred yards away I was after him with a shout I remember
hearing children and women screaming and seeing them flying from the
road

He was fleet but I was stronger A mile and I had almost come up
with him He doubled cunningly and dashed into a brake that extended
into a small canon I crashed through this after him and in five
minutes had him cornered in an angle of insurmountable cliffs There
his instinct of selfpreservation steadied him as it will steady even
animals at bay He turned to me quite calm with a ghastly smile

Oh Rayburn he said with such an awful effort at ease that I was
impolite enough to laugh rudely in his face Oh Rayburn said he
come lets have done with this nonsense Of course I know its the
fever and youre not yourself but collect yourself mangive me that
ridiculous weapon now and lets go back and talk it over

I will go back said I carrying your head with me We will see
how charmingly it can discourse when it lies in the basket at her
door

Come said he persuasively I think better of you than to suppose
that you try this sort of thing as a joke But even the vagaries of
a fevercrazed lunatic come some time to a limit What is this talk
about heads and baskets Get yourself together and throw away that
absurd canechopper What would Miss Greene think of you he ended
with the silky cajolery that one would use toward a fretful child

Listen said I At last you have struck upon the right note What
would she think of me Listen I repeated

There are women I said who look upon horsehair sofas and currant
wine as dross To them even the calculated modulation of your
welltrimmed talk sounds like the dropping of rotten plums from a tree
in the night They are the maidens who walk back and forth in the
villages scorning the emptiness of the baskets at the doors of the
young men who would win them

One such as they I said is waiting Only a fool would try to win
a woman by drooling like a braggart in her doorway or by waiting upon
her whims like a footman They are all daughters of Herodias and to
gain their hearts one must lay the heads of his enemies before them
with his own hands Now bend your neck Louis Devoe Do not be a
coward as well as a chatterer at a ladys teatable

There there said Devoe falteringly You know me dont you
Rayburn

Oh yes I said I know you I know you I know you But the
basket is empty The old men of the village and the young men and
both the dark maidens and the ones who are as fair as pearls walk back
and forth and see its emptiness Will you kneel now or must we have
a scuffle It is not like you to make things go roughly and with bad
form But the basket is waiting for your head

With that he went to pieces I had to catch him as he tried to
scamper past me like a scared rabbit I stretched him out and got a
foot on his chest but he squirmed like a worm although I appealed
repeatedly to his sense of propriety and the duty he owed to himself
as a gentleman not to make a row

But at last he gave me the chance and I swung the machete

It was not hard work He flopped like a chicken during the six or
seven blows that it took to sever his head but finally he lay still
and I tied his head in my handkerchief The eyes opened and shut
thrice while I walked a hundred yards I was red to my feet with the
drip but what did that matter With delight I felt under my hands
the crisp touch of his short thick brown hair and closetrimmed
beard

I reached the house of the Greenes and dumped the head of Louis Devoe
into the basket that still hung by the nail in the doorjamb I sat
in a chair under the awning and waited The sun was within two hours
of setting Chloe came out and looked surprised

Where have you been Tommy she asked You were gone when I came
out

Look in the basket I said rising to my feet She looked and gave
a little screamof delight I was pleased to note

Oh Tommy she said It was just what I wanted you to do Its
leaking a little but that doesnt matter Wasnt I telling you
Its the little things that count And you remembered

Little things She held the ensanguined head of Louis Devoe in her
white apron Tiny streams of red widened on her apron and dripped
upon the floor Her face was bright and tender

Little things indeed I thought again The headhunters are
right These are the things that women like you to do for them

Chloe came close to me There was no one in sight She looked tip at
me with seablue eyes that said things they had never said before

You think of me she said You are the man I was describing You
think of the little things and they are what make the world worth
living in The man for me must consider my little wishes and make me
happy in small ways He must bring me little red peaches in December
if I wish for them and then I will love him till June I will have
no knight in armor slaying his rival or killing dragons for me You
please me very well Tommy

I stooped and kissed her Then a moisture broke out on my forehead
and I began to feel weak I saw the red stains vanish from Chloes
apron and the head of Louis Devoe turn to a brown dried cocoanut

There will be cocoanutpudding for dinner Tommy boy said Chloe
gayly and you must come I must go in for a little while

She vanished in a delightful flutter

Dr Stamford tramped up hurriedly He seized my pulse as though it
were his own property that I had escaped with

You are the biggest fool outside of any asylum he said angrily
Why did you leave your bed And the idiotic things youve been
doingand no wonder with your pulse going like a sledgehammer

Name some of them said I

Devoe sent for me said Stamford He saw you from his window go to
old Campos store chase him up the hill with his own yardstick and
then come back and make off with his biggest cocoanut

Its the little things that count after all said I

Its your little bed that counts with you just now said the doctor
You come with me at once or Ill throw up the case Youre as
loony as a loon

So I got no cocoanutpudding that evening but I conceived a distrust
as to the value of the method of the headhunters Perhaps for many
centuries the maidens of the villages may have been looking wistfully
at the heads in the baskets at the doorways longing for other and
lesser trophies




NO STORY


To avoid having this book hurled into corner of the room by the
suspicious reader I will assert in time that this is not a newspaper
story You will encounter no shirtsleeved omniscient city editor
no prodigy cub reporter just off the farm no scoop no storyno
anything

But if you will concede me the setting of the first scene in the
reporters room of the _Morning Beacon_ I will repay the favor by
keeping strictly my promises set forth above

I was doing spacework on the _Beacon_ hoping to be put on a salary
Some one had cleared with a rake or a shovel a small space for me at
the end of a long table piled high with exchanges _Congressional
Records_ and old files There I did my work I wrote whatever the
city whispered or roared or chuckled to me on my diligent wanderings
about its streets My income was not regular

One day Tripp came in and leaned on my table Tripp was something in
the mechanical departmentI think he had something to do with the
pictures for he smelled of photographers supplies and his hands
were always stained and cut up with acids He was about twentyfive
and looked forty Half of his face was covered with short curly red
whiskers that looked like a doormat with the welcome left off He
was pale and unhealthy and miserable and fawning and an assiduous
borrower of sums ranging from twentyfive cents to a dollar One
dollar was his limit He knew the extent of his credit as well as the
Chemical National Bank knows the amount of H2O that collateral will
show on analysis When he sat on my table he held one hand with the
other to keep both from shaking Whiskey He had a spurious air of
lightness and bravado about him that deceived no one but was useful
in his borrowing because it was so pitifully and perceptibly assumed

This day I had coaxed from the cashier five shining silver dollars as
a grumbling advance on a story that the Sunday editor had reluctantly
accepted So if I was not feeling at peace with the world at least
an armistice had been declared and I was beginning with ardor to
write a description of the Brooklyn Bridge by moonlight

Well Tripp said I looking up at him rather impatiently how goes
it He was looking today more miserable more cringing and haggard
and downtrodden than I had ever seen him He was at that stage of
misery where he drew your pity so fully that you longed to kick him

Have you got a dollar asked Tripp with his most fawning look
and his doglike eyes that blinked in the narrow space between his
highgrowing matted beard and his lowgrowing matted hair

I have said I and again I said I have more loudly and
inhospitably and four besides And I had hard work corkscrewing
them out of old Atkinson I can tell you And I drew them I
continued to meet a wanta hiatusa demanda needan exigencya
requirement of exactly five dollars

I was driven to emphasis by the premonition that I was to lose one of
the dollars on the spot

I dont want to borrow any said Tripp and I breathed again I
thought youd like to get put onto a good story he went on Ive
got a rattling fine one for you You ought to make it run a column
at least Itll make a dandy if you work it up right Itll probably
cost you a dollar or two to get the stuff I dont want anything out
of it myself

I became placated The proposition showed that Tripp appreciated past
favors although he did not return them If he had been wise enough
to strike me for a quarter then he would have got it

What is the story I asked poising my pencil with a finely
calculated editorial air

Ill tell you said Tripp Its a girl A beauty One of the
howlingest Amsdens Junes you ever saw Rosebuds covered with dew
violets in their mossy bedand truck like that Shes lived on Long
Island twenty years and never saw New York City before I ran against
her on Thirtyfourth Street Shed just got in on the East River
ferry I tell you shes a beauty that would take the hydrogen out
of all the peroxides in the world She stopped me on the street and
asked me where she could find George Brown Asked me where she could
find _George Brown in New York City_ What do you think of that

I talked to her and found that she was going to marry a young
farmer named DoddHiram Doddnext week But it seems that George
Brown still holds the championship in her youthful fancy George had
greased his cowhide boots some years ago and came to the city to make
his fortune But he forgot to remember to show up again at Greenburg
and Hiram got in as secondbest choice But when it comes to the
scratch Adaher names Ada Lowerysaddles a nag and rides eight
miles to the railroad station and catches the 645 AM train for
the city Looking for George you knowyou understand about women
George wasnt there so she wanted him

Well you know I couldnt leave her loose in WolftownontheHudson
I suppose she thought the first person she inquired of would say
George Brownwhy yeslemme seehes a short man with lightblue
eyes aint he Oh yesyoull find George on One Hundred and
Twentyfifth Street right next to the grocery Hes billclerk in
a saddleandharness store Thats about how innocent and beautiful
she is You know those little Long Island waterfront villages like
Greenburga couple of duckfarms for sport and clams and about nine
summer visitors for industries Thats the kind of a place she comes
from But sayyou ought to see her

What could I do I dont know what money looks like in the morning
And shed paid her last cent of pocketmoney for her railroad ticket
except a quarter which she had squandered on gumdrops She was
eating them out of a paper bag I took her to a boardinghouse on
Thirtysecond Street where I used to live and hocked her Shes in
soak for a dollar Thats old Mother McGinnis price per day Ill
show you the house

What words are these Tripp said I I thought you said you had a
story Every ferryboat that crosses the East River brings or takes
away girls from Long Island

The premature lines on Tripps face grew deeper He frowned seriously
from his tangle of hair He separated his hands and emphasized his
answer with one shaking forefinger

Cant you see he said what a rattling fine story it would make
You could do it fine All about the romance you know and describe
the girl and put a lot of stuff in it about true love and sling
in a few stickfuls of funny businessjoshing the Long Islanders
about being green and wellyou know how to do it You ought to
get fifteen dollars out of it anyhow And itll cost you only about
four dollars Youll make a clear profit of eleven

How will it cost me four dollars I asked suspiciously

One dollar to Mrs McGinnis Tripp answered promptly and two
dollars to pay the girls fare back home

And the fourth dimension I inquired making a rapid mental
calculation

One dollar to me said Tripp For whiskey Are you on

I smiled enigmatically and spread my elbows as if to begin writing
again But this grim abject specious subservient burrlike wreck
of a man would not be shaken off His forehead suddenly became
shiningly moist

Dont you see he said with a sort of desperate calmness that
this girl has got to be sent home todaynot tonight nor tomorrow
but today I cant do anything for her You know Im the janitor
and corresponding secretary of the DownandOut Club I thought you
could make a newspaper story out of it and win out a piece of money
on general results But anyhow dont you see that shes got to get
back home before night

And then I began to feel that dull leaden souldepressing sensation
known as the sense of duty Why should that sense fall upon one as a
weight and a burden I knew that I was doomed that day to give up the
bulk of my store of hardwrung coin to the relief of this Ada Lowery
But I swore to myself that Tripps whiskey dollar would not be
forthcoming He might play knighterrant at my expense but he would
indulge in no wassail afterward commemorating my weakness and
gullibility In a kind of chilly anger I put on my coat and hat

Tripp submissive cringing vainly endeavoring to please conducted
me via the streetcars to the human pawnshop of Mother McGinnis I
paid the fares It seemed that the collodionscented Don Quixote and
the smallest minted coin were strangers

Tripp pulled the bell at the door of the mouldy redbrick
boardinghouse At its faint tinkle he paled and crouched as a
rabbit makes ready to spring away at the sound of a huntingdog
I guessed what a life he had led terrorhaunted by the coming
footsteps of landladies

Give me one of the dollarsquick he said

The door opened six inches Mother McGinnis stood there with white
eyesthey were white I sayand a yellow face holding together at
her throat with one hand a dingy pink flannel dressingsack Tripp
thrust the dollar through the space without a word and it bought us
entry

Shes in the parlor said the McGinnis turning the back of her sack
upon us

In the dim parlor a girl sat at the cracked marble centretable
weeping comfortably and eating gumdrops She was a flawless beauty
Crying had only made her brilliant eyes brighter When she crunched
a gumdrop you thought only of the poetry of motion and envied the
senseless confection Eve at the age of five minutes must have been
a ringer for Miss Ada Lowery at nineteen or twenty I was introduced
and a gumdrop suffered neglect while she conveyed to me a naive
interest such as a puppy dog a prize winner might bestow upon a
crawling beetle or a frog

Tripp took his stand by the table with the fingers of one hand spread
upon it as an attorney or a master of ceremonies might have stood
But he looked the master of nothing His faded coat was buttoned
high as if it sought to be charitable to deficiencies of tie and
linen

I thought of a Scotch terrier at the sight of his shifty eyes in the
glade between his tangled hair and beard For one ignoble moment I
felt ashamed of having been introduced as his friend in the presence
of so much beauty in distress But evidently Tripp meant to conduct
the ceremonies whatever they might be I thought I detected in his
actions and pose an intention of foisting the situation upon me as
material for a newspaper story in a lingering hope of extracting from
me his whiskey dollar

My friend I shuddered Mr Chalmers said Tripp will tell
you Miss Lowery the same that I did Hes a reporter and he can
hand out the talk better than I can Thats why I brought him with
me O Tripp wasnt it the _silver_tongued orator you wanted
Hes wise to a lot of things and hell tell you now whats best
to do

I stood on one foot as it were as I sat in my rickety chair

WhyerMiss Lowery I began secretly enraged at Tripps awkward
opening I am at your service of course buteras I havent been
apprized of the circumstances of the case Ier

Oh said Miss Lowery beaming for a moment it aint as bad as
thatthere aint any circumstances Its the first time Ive ever
been in New York except once when I was five years old and I had no
idea it was such a big town And I met MrMr Snip on the street
and asked him about a friend of mine and he brought me here and asked
me to wait

I advise you Miss Lowery said Tripp to tell Mr Chalmers all
Hes a friend of mine I was getting used to it by this time and
hell give you the right tip

Why certainly said Miss Ada chewing a gumdrop toward me There
aint anything to tell except thatwell everythings fixed for me to
marry Hiram Dodd next Thursday evening Hi has got two hundred acres
of land with a lot of shorefront and one of the best truckfarms on
the Island But this morning I had my horse saddled uphes a white
horse named Dancerand I rode over to the station I told em at
home I was going to spend the day with Susie Adams It was a story
I guess but I dont care And I came to New York on the train and
I met MrMr Flip on the street and asked him if he knew where I
could find GG

Now Miss Lowery broke in Tripp loudly and with much bad taste
I thought as she hesitated with her word you like this young man
Hiram Dodd dont you Hes all right and good to you aint he

Of course I like him said Miss Lowery emphatically His all
right And of course hes good to me So is everybody

I could have sworn it myself Throughout Miss Ada Lowerys life all
men would be to good to her They would strive contrive struggle
and compete to hold umbrellas over her hat check her trunk pick up
her handkerchief and buy for her soda at the fountain

But went on Miss Lowery last night I got to thinking about
GGeorge and I

Down went the bright gold head upon dimpled clasped hands on the
table Such a beautiful April storm Unrestrainedly she sobbed I
wished I could have comforted her But I was not George And I was
glad I was not Hiramand yet I was sorry too

Byandby the shower passed She straightened up brave and halfway
smiling She would have made a splendid wife for crying only made
her eyes more bright and tender She took a gumdrop and began her
story

I guess Im a terrible hayseed she said between her little gulps
and sighs but I cant help it GGeorge Brown and I were sweethearts
since he was eight and I was five When he was nineteenthat was
four years agohe left Greenburg and went to the city He said he was
going to be a policeman or a railroad president or something And then
he was coming back for me But I never heard from him any more And
IIliked him

Another flow of tears seemed imminent but Tripp hurled himself into
the crevasse and dammed it Confound him I could see his game He
was trying to make a story of it for his sordid ends and profit

Go on Mr Chalmers said he and tell the lady whats the proper
caper Thats what I told heryoud hand it to her straight Spiel
up

I coughed and tried to feel less wrathful toward Tripp I saw my
duty Cunningly I had been inveigled but I was securely trapped
Tripps first dictum to me had been just and correct The young lady
must be sent back to Greenburg that day She must be argued with
convinced assured instructed ticketed and returned without delay
I hated Hiram and despised George but duty must be done _Noblesse
oblige_ and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic
compatibles but sometimes they can be made to jibe It was mine to
be Sir Oracle and then pay the freight So I assumed an air that
mingled Solomons with that of the general passenger agent of the
Long Island Railroad

Miss Lowery said I as impressively as I could life is rather a
queer proposition after all There was a familiar sound to these
words after I had spoken them and I hoped Miss Lowery had never
heard Mr Cohans song Those whom we first love we seldom wed Our
earlier romances tinged with the magic radiance of youth often fail
to materialize The last three words sounded somewhat trite when
they struck the air But those fondly cherished dreams I went
on may cast a pleasant afterglow on our future lives however
impracticable and vague they may have been But life is full of
realities as well as visions and dreams One cannot live on memories
May I ask Miss Lowery if you think you could pass a happythat is
a contented and harmonious life with MrerDoddif in other ways
than romantic recollections he seems toerfill the bill as I might
say

Oh His all right answered Miss Lowery Yes I could get along
with him fine Hes promised me an automobile and a motorboat But
somehow when it got so close to the time I was to marry him I
couldnt help wishingwell just thinking about George Something
must have happened to him or hed have written On the day he left
he and me got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces I
took one piece and he took the other and we promised to be true to
each other and always keep the pieces till we saw each other again
Ive got mine at home now in a ringbox in the top drawer of my
dresser I guess I was silly to come up here looking for him I
never realized what a big place it is

And then Tripp joined in with a little grating laugh that he had
still trying to drag in a little story or drama to earn the miserable
dollar that he craved

Oh the boys from the country forget a lot when they come to the city
and learn something I guess George maybe is on the bum or got
roped in by some other girl or maybe gone to the dogs on account of
whiskey or the races You listen to Mr Chalmers and go back home
and youll be all right

But now the time was come for action for the hands of the clock
were moving close to noon Frowning upon Tripp I argued gently and
philosophically with Miss Lowery delicately convincing her of the
importance of returning home at once And I impressed upon her
the truth that it would not be absolutely necessary to her future
happiness that she mention to Hi the wonders or the fact of her visit
to the city that had swallowed up the unlucky George

She said she had left her horse unfortunate Rosinante tied to a tree
near the railroad station Tripp and I gave her instructions to mount
the patient steed as soon as she arrived and ride home as fast as
possible There she was to recount the exciting adventure of a day
spent with Susie Adams She could fix SusieI was sure of that
and all would be well

And then being susceptible to the barbed arrows of beauty I warmed
to the adventure The three of us hurried to the ferry and there I
found the price of a ticket to Greenburg to be but a dollar and eighty
cents I bought one and a red red rose with the twenty cents for
Miss Lowery We saw her aboard her ferryboat and stood watching her
wave her handkerchief at us until it was the tiniest white patch
imaginable And then Tripp and I faced each other brought back to
earth left dry and desolate in the shade of the sombre verities of
life

The spell wrought by beauty and romance was dwindling I looked at
Tripp and almost sneered He looked more careworn contemptible and
disreputable than ever I fingered the two silver dollars remaining
in my pocket and looked at him with the halfclosed eyelids of
contempt He mustered up an imitation of resistance

Cant you get a story out of it he asked huskily Some sort of
a story even if you have to fake part of it

Not a line said I I can fancy the look on Grimes face if I
should try to put over any slush like this But weve helped the
little lady out and thatll have to be our only reward

Im sorry said Tripp almost inaudibly Im sorry youre out your
money Now it seemed to me like a find of a big story you know
that is a sort of thing that would write up pretty well

Lets try to forget it said I with a praiseworthy attempt at
gayety and take the next car cross town

I steeled myself against his unexpressed but palpable desire He
should not coax cajole or wring from me the dollar he craved I had
had enough of that wildgoose chase

Tripp feebly unbuttoned his coat of the faded pattern and glossy seams
to reach for something that had once been a handkerchief deep down in
some obscure and cavernous pocket As he did so I caught the shine
of a cheap silverplated watchchain across his vest and something
dangling from it caused me to stretch forth my hand and seize it
curiously It was the half of a silver dime that had been cut in
halves with a chisel

What I said looking at him keenly

Oh yes he responded dully George Brown alias Tripp Whats
the use

Barring the W C T U Id like to know if anybody disapproves of
my having produced promptly from my pocket Tripps whiskey dollar and
unhesitatingly laying it in his hand

Once upon a time I found a tencent magazine lying on a bench in a
little city park Anyhow that was the amount he asked me for when
I sat on the bench next to him He was a musty dingy and tattered
magazine with some queer stories bound in him I was sure He turned
out to be a scrapbook

I am a newspaper reporter I said to him to try him I have been
detailed to write up some of the experiences of the unfortunate ones
who spend their evenings in this park May I ask you to what you
attribute your downfall in

I was interrupted by a laugh from my purchasea laugh so rusty and
unpractised that I was sure it had been his first for many a day

Oh no no said he You aint a reporter Reporters dont talk
that way They pretend to be one of us and say theyve just got in
on the blind baggage from St Louis I can tell a reporter on sight
Us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature We sit here all
day and watch the people go by I can size up anybody who walks past
my bench in a way that would surprise you

Well I said go on and tell me How do you size me up

I should say said the student of human nature with unpardonable
hesitation that you was say in the contracting businessor maybe
worked in a storeor was a signpainter You stopped in the park to
finish your cigar and thought youd get a little free monologue out
of me Still you might be a plasterer or a lawyerits getting kind
of dark you see And your wife wont let you smoke at home

I frowned gloomily

But judging again went on the reader of men Id say you aint
got a wife

No said I rising restlessly No no no I aint But I _will_
have by the arrows of Cupid That is if

My voice must have trailed away and muffled itself in uncertainty and
despair

I see you have a story yourself said the dusty vagrantimpudently
it seemed to me Suppose you take your dime back and spin your yarn
for me Im interested myself in the ups and downs of unfortunate
ones who spend their evenings in the park

Somehow that amused me I looked at the frowsy derelict with more
interest I did have a story Why not tell it to him I had told
none of my friends I had always been a reserved and bottledup man
It was psychical timidity or sensitivenessperhaps both And I smiled
to myself in wonder when I felt an impulse to confide in this stranger
and vagabond

Jack said I

Mack said he

Mack said I Ill tell you

Do you want the dime back in advance said he

I handed him a dollar

The dime said I was the price of listening to _your_ story

Right on the point of the jaw said he Go on

And then incredible as it may seem to the lovers in the world who
confide their sorrows only to the night wind and the gibbous moon I
laid bare my secret to that wreck of all things that you would have
supposed to be in sympathy with love

I told him of the days and weeks and months that I had spent in
adoring Mildred Telfair I spoke of my despair my grievous days
and wakeful nights my dwindling hopes and distress of mind I even
pictured to this nightprowler her beauty and dignity the great sway
she had in society and the magnificence of her life as the elder
daughter of an ancient race whose pride overbalanced the dollars of
the citys millionaires

Why dont you cop the lady out asked Mack bringing me down to
earth and dialect again

I explained to him that my worth was so small my income so minute
and my fears so large that I hadnt the courage to speak to her of
my worship I told him that in her presence I could only blush and
stammer and that she looked upon me with a wonderful maddening smile
of amusement

She kind of moves in the professional class dont she asked Mack

The Telfair family I began haughtily

I mean professional beauty said my hearer

She is greatly and widely admired I answered cautiously

Any sisters

One

You know any more girls

Why several I answered And a few others

Say said Mack tell me one thingcan you hand out the dope
to other girls Can you chin em and make matinee eyes at em and
squeeze em You know what I mean Youre just shy when it comes to
this particular damethe professional beautyaint that right

In a way you have outlined the situation with approximate truth I
admitted

I thought so said Mack grimly Now that reminds me of my own
case Ill tell you about it

I was indignant but concealed it What was this loafers case or
anybodys case compared with mine Besides I had given him a dollar
and ten cents

Feel my muscle said my companion suddenly flexing his biceps I
did so mechanically The fellows in gyms are always asking you to do
that His arm was as hard as castiron

Four years ago said Mack I could lick any man in New York outside
of the professional ring Your case and mine is just the same I come
from the West Sidebetween Thirtieth and FourteenthI wont give the
number on the door I was a scrapper when I was ten and when I was
twenty no amateur in the city could stand up four rounds with me S
a fact You know Bill McCarty No He managed the smokers for some
of them swell clubs Well I knocked out everything Bill brought up
before me I was a middleweight but could train down to a welter
when necessary I boxed all over the West Side at bouts and benefits
and private entertainments and was never put out once

But say the first time I put my foot in the ring with a professional
I was no more than a canned lobster I dunno how it wasI seemed to
lose heart I guess I got too much imagination There was a formality
and publicness about it that kind of weakened my nerve I never won a
fight in the ring Lightweights and all kinds of scrubs used to sign
up with my manager and then walk up and tap me on the wrist and see me
fall The minute I seen the crowd and a lot of gents in evening clothes
down in front and seen a professional come inside the ropes I got as
weak as gingerale

Of course it wasnt long till I couldnt get no backers and I didnt
have any more chances to fight a professionalor many amateurs
either But lemme tell youI was as good as most men inside the ring
or out It was just that dumb dead feeling I had when I was up against
a regular that always done me up

Well sir after I had got out of the business I got a mighty grouch
on I used to go round town licking private citizens and all kinds of
unprofessionals just to please myself Id lick cops in dark streets
and carconductors and cabdrivers and draymen whenever I could start
a row with em It didnt make any difference how big they were or
how much science they had I got away with em If Id only just have
had the confidence in the ring that I had beating up the best men
outside of it Id be wearing black pearls and heliotrope silk socks
today

One evening I was walking along near the Bowery thinking about
things when along comes a slummingparty About six or seven they
was all in swallowtails and these silk hats that dont shine One
of the gang kind of shoves me off the sidewalk I hadnt had a scrap
in three days and I just says Delighted and hits him back of
the ear

Well we had it That Johnnie put up as decent a little fight as
youd want to see in the moving pictures It was on a side street
and no cops around The other guy had a lot of science but it only
took me about six minutes to lay him out

Some of the swallowtails dragged him up against some steps and began
to fan him Another one of em comes over to me and says

Young man do you know what youve done

Oh beat it says I Ive done nothing but a little punchingbag
work Take Freddy back to Yale and tell him to quit studying
sociology on the wrong side of the sidewalk

My good fellow says he I dont know who you are but Id like
to Youve knocked out Reddy Burns the champion middleweight of the
world He came to New York yesterday to try to get a match on with
Jim Jeffries If you

But when I come out of my faint I was laying on the floor in a
drugstore saturated with aromatic spirits of ammonia If Id known
that was Reddy Burns Id have got down in the gutter and crawled past
him instead of handing him one like I did Why if Id ever been in a
ring and seen him climbing over the ropes Id have been all to the
salvolatile

So thats what imagination does concluded Mack And as I said
your case and mine is simultaneous Youll never win out You cant
go up against the professionals I tell you its a park bench for
yours in this romance business

Mack the pessimist laughed harshly

Im afraid I dont see the parallel I said coldly I have only a
very slight acquaintance with the prizering

The derelict touched my sleeve with his forefinger for emphasis as
he explained his parable

Every man said he with some dignity has got his lamps on
something that looks good to him With you its this dame that
youre afraid to say your say to With me it was to win out in the
ring Well youll lose just like I did

Why do you think I shall lose I asked warmly

Cause said he youre afraid to go in the ring You dassent
stand up before a professional Your case and mine is just the same
Youre a amateur and that means that youd better keep outside of the
ropes

Well I must be going I said rising and looking with elaborate
care at my watch

When I was twenty feet away the parkbencher called to me

Much obliged for the dollar he said And for the dime But
youll never get er Youre in the amateur class

Serves you right I said to myself for hobnobbing with a tramp
His impudence

But as I walked his words seemed to repeat themselves over and over
again in my brain I think I even grew angry at the man

Ill show him I finally said aloud Ill show him that I can
fight Reddy Burns tooeven knowing who he is

I hurried to a telephonebooth and rang up the Telfair residence

A soft sweet voice answered Didnt I know that voice My hand
holding the receiver shook

Is that _you_ said I employing the foolish words that form the
vocabulary of every talker through the telephone

Yes this is I came back the answer in the low clearcut tones
that are an inheritance of the Telfairs Who is it please

Its me said I less ungrammatically than egotistically Its me
and Ive got a few things that I want to say to you right now and
immediately and straight to the point

_Dear_ me said the voice Oh its you Mr Arden

I wondered if any accent on the first word was intended Mildred was
fine at saying things that you had to study out afterward

Yes said I I hope so And now to come down to brass tacks I
thought that rather a vernacularism if there is such a word as
soon as I had said it but I didnt stop to apologize You know of
course that I love you and that I have been in that idiotic state
for a long time I dont want any more foolishness about itthat is
I mean I want an answer from you right now Will you marry me or not
Hold the wire please Keep out Central Hello hello Will you or
will you _not_

That was just the uppercut for Reddy Burns chin The answer came
back

Why Phil dear of course I will I didnt know that youthat is
you never saidoh come up to the house pleaseI cant say what I
want to over the phone You are so importunate But please come up
to the house wont you

Would I

I rang the bell of the Telfair house violently Some sort of a human
came to the door and shooed me into the drawingroom

Oh well said I to myself looking at the ceiling any one can
learn from any one That was a pretty good philosophy of Macks
anyhow He didnt take advantage of his experience but I get the
benefit of it If you want to get into the professional class youve
got to

I stopped thinking then Some one was coming down the stairs My
knees began to shake I knew then how Mack had felt when a
professional began to climb over the ropes

I looked around foolishly for a door or a window by which I might
escape If it had been any other girl approaching I mightnt have

But just then the door opened and Bess Mildreds younger sister
came in Id never seen her look so much like a glorified angel She
walked straight tip to me andand

Id never noticed before what perfectly wonderful eyes and hair
Elizabeth Telfair had

Phil she said in the Telfair sweet thrilling tones why didnt
you tell me about it before I thought it was sister you wanted all
the time until you telephoned to me a few minutes ago

I suppose Mack and I always will be hopeless amateurs But as the
thing has turned out in my case Im mighty glad of it




BESTSELLER


I


One day last summer I went to Pittsburghwell I had to go there on
business

My chaircar was profitably well filled with people of the kind one
usually sees on chaircars Most of them were ladies in brownsilk
dresses cut with square yokes with lace insertion and dotted veils
who refused to have the windows raised Then there was the usual
number of men who looked as if they might be in almost any business
and going almost anywhere Some students of human nature can look at
a man in a Pullman and tell you where he is from his occupation and
his stations in life both flag and social but I never could The
only way I can correctly judge a fellowtraveller is when the train is
held up by robbers or when he reaches at the same time I do for the
last towel in the dressingroom of the sleeper

The porter came and brushed the collection of soot on the windowsill
off to the left knee of my trousers I removed it with an air of
apology The temperature was eightyeight One of the dottedveiled
ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators and spoke loudly
of Interlaken I leaned back idly in chair No 7 and looked with
the tepidest curiosity at the small black baldspotted head just
visible above the back of No 9

Suddenly No 9 hurled a book to the floor between his chair and the
window and looking I saw that it was The RoseLady and Trevelyan
one of the bestselling novels of the present day And then the
critic or Philistine whichever he was veered his chair toward the
window and I knew him at once for John A Pescud of Pittsburgh
travelling salesman for a plateglass companyan old acquaintance
whom I had not seen in two years

In two minutes we were faced had shaken hands and had finished with
such topics as rain prosperity health residence and destination
Politics might have followed next but I was not so illfated

I wish you might know John A Pescud He is of the stuff that heroes
are not often lucky enough to be made of He is a small man with a
wide smile and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red
spot on the end of your nose I never saw him wear but one kind of
necktie and he believes in cuffholders and buttonshoes He is as
hard and true as anything ever turned out by the Cambria Steel Works
and he believes that as soon as Pittsburgh makes smokeconsumers
compulsory St Peter will come down and sit at the foot of
Smithfield Street and let somebody else attend to the gate up in
the branch heaven He believes that our plateglass is the most
important commodity in the world and that when a man is in his home
town he ought to be decent and lawabiding

During my acquaintance with him in the City of Diurnal Night I had
never known his views on life romance literature and ethics We
had browsed during our meetings on local topics and then parted
after Chateau Margaux Irish stew flannelcakes cottagepudding
and coffee hey therewith milk separate Now I was to get more
of his ideas By way of facts he told me that business had picked
up since the party conventions and that he was going to get off at
Coketown


II


Say said Pescud stirring his discarded book with the toe of his
right shoe did you ever read one of these bestsellers I mean
the kind where the hero is an American swellsometimes even from
Chicagowho falls in love with a royal princess from Europe who is
travelling under an alias and follows her to her fathers kingdom
or principality I guess you have Theyre all alike Sometimes
this goingaway masher is a Washington newspaper correspondent
and sometimes he is a Van Something from New York or a Chicago
wheatbroker worthy fifty millions But hes always ready to break
into the king row of any foreign country that sends over their queens
and princesses to try the new plush seats on the Big Four or the B
and O There doesnt seem to be any other reason in the book for their
being here

Well this fellow chases the royal chairwarmer home as I said and
finds out who she is He meets her on the _corso_ or the _strasse_ one
evening and gives us ten pages of conversation She reminds him of
the difference in their stations and that gives him a chance to ring
in three solid pages about Americas uncrowned sovereigns If youd
take his remarks and set em to music and then take the music away
from em theyd sound exactly like one of George Cohans songs

Well you know how it runs on if youve read any of emhe slaps
the kings Swiss bodyguards around like everything whenever they
get in his way Hes a great fencer too Now Ive known of some
Chicago men who were pretty notorious fences but I never heard of
any fencers coming from there He stands on the first landing of the
royal staircase in Castle Schutzenfestenstein with a gleaming rapier
in his hand and makes a Baltimore broil of six platoons of traitors
who come to massacre the said king And then he has to fight duels
with a couple of chancellors and foil a plot by four Austrian
archdukes to seize the kingdom for a gasolinestation

But the great scene is when his rival for the princess hand Count
Feodor attacks him between the portcullis and the ruined chapel
armed with a mitrailleuse a yataghan and a couple of Siberian
bloodhounds This scene is what runs the bestseller into the
twentyninth edition before the publisher has had time to draw a
check for the advance royalties

The American hero shucks his coat and throws it over the heads of the
bloodhounds gives the mitrailleuse a slap with his mitt says Yah
to the yataghan and lands in Kid McCoys best style on the counts
left eye Of course we have a neat little prizefight right then
and there The countin order to make the go possibleseems to be
an expert at the art of selfdefence himself and here we have the
CorbettSullivan fight done over into literature The book ends with
the broker and the princess doing a John Cecil Clay cover under the
lindentrees on the Gorgonzola Walk That winds up the lovestory
plenty good enough But I notice that the book dodges the final
issue Even a bestseller has sense enough to shy at either leaving a
Chicago grain broker on the throne of Lobsterpotsdam or bringing over
a real princess to eat fish and potato salad in an Italian chalet on
Michigan Avenue What do you think about em

Why said I I hardly know John Theres a saying Love levels
all ranks you know

Yes said Pescud but these kind of lovestories are rankon the
level I know something about literature even if I am in plateglass
These kind of books are wrong and yet I never go into a train but
what they pile em up on me No good can come out of an international
clinch between the OldWorld aristocracy and one of us fresh
Americans When people in real life marry they generally hunt up
somebody in their own station A fellow usually picks out a girl that
went to the same highschool and belonged to the same singingsociety
that he did When young millionaires fall in love they always select
the chorusgirl that likes the same kind of sauce on the lobster that
he does Washington newspaper correspondents always many widow ladies
ten years older than themselves who keep boardinghouses No sir
you cant make a novel sound right to me when it makes one of C D
Gibsons bright young men go abroad and turn kingdoms upside down
just because hes a Taft American and took a course at a gymnasium
And listen how they talk too

Pescud picked up the bestseller and hunted his page

Listen at this said he Trevelyan is chinning with the Princess
Alwyna at the back end of the tulipgarden This is how it goes


 Say not so dearest and sweetest of earths fairest flowers
 Would I aspire You are a star set high above me in a royal
 heaven I am onlymyself Yet I am a man and I have a heart
 to do and dare I have no title save that of an uncrowned
 sovereign but I have an arm and a sword that yet might free
 Schutzenfestenstein from the plots of traitors


Think of a Chicago man packing a sword and talking about freeing
anything that sounded as much like canned pork as that Hed be much
more likely to fight to have an import duty put on it

I think I understand you John said I You want fictionwriters
to be consistent with their scenes and characters They shouldnt
mix Turkish pashas with Vermont farmers or English dukes with Long
Island clamdiggers or Italian countesses with Montana cowboys or
Cincinnati brewery agents with the rajahs of India

Or plain business men with aristocracy high above em added Pescud
It dont jibe People are divided into classes whether we admit it
or not and its everybodys impulse to stick to their own class
They do it too I dont see why people go to work and buy hundreds
of thousands of books like that You dont see or hear of any such
didoes and capers in real life


III


Well John said I I havent read a bestseller in a long time
Maybe Ive had notions about them somewhat like yours But tell me
more about yourself Getting along all right with the company

Bully said Pescud brightening at once Ive had my salary raised
twice since I saw you and I get a commission too Ive bought a
neat slice of real estate out in the East End and have run up a
house on it Next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of
stock Oh Im in on the line of General Prosperity no matter whos
elected

Met your affinity yet John I asked

Oh I didnt tell you about that did I said Pescud with a broader
grin

Oho I said So youve taken time enough off from your plateglass
to have a romance

No no said John No romancenothing like that But Ill tell
you about it

I was on the southbound going to Cincinnati about eighteen months
ago when I saw across the aisle the finestlooking girl Id ever
laid eyes on Nothing spectacular you know but just the sort you
want for keeps Well I never was up to the flirtation business
either handkerchief automobile postagestamp or doorstep and she
wasnt the kind to start anything She read a book and minded her
business which was to make the world prettier and better just by
residing on it I kept on looking out of the side doors of my eyes
and finally the proposition got out of the Pullman class into a case
of a cottage with a lawn and vines running over the porch I never
thought of speaking to her but I let the plateglass business go to
smash for a while

She changed cars at Cincinnati and took a sleeper to Louisville over
the L and N There she bought another ticket and went on through
Shelbyville Frankfort and Lexington Along there I began to have
a hard time keeping up with her The trains came along when they
pleased and didnt seem to be going anywhere in particular except to
keep on the track and the right of way as much as possible Then they
began to stop at junctions instead of towns and at last they stopped
altogether Ill bet Pinkerton would outbid the plateglass people
for my services any time if they knew how I managed to shadow that
young lady I contrived to keep out of her sight as much as I could
but I never lost track of her

The last station she got off at was away down in Virginia about
six in the afternoon There were about fifty houses and four hundred
niggers in sight The rest was red mud mules and speckled hounds

A tall old man with a smooth face and white hair looking as proud
as Julius Caesar and Roscoe Conkling on the same postcard was there
to meet her His clothes were frazzled but I didnt notice that
till later He took her little satchel and they started over the
plankwalks and went up a road along the hill I kept along a piece
behind em trying to look like I was hunting a garnet ring in the
sand that my sister had lost at a picnic the previous Saturday

They went in a gate on top of the hill It nearly took my breath
away when I looked up Up there in the biggest grove I ever saw was a
tremendous house with round white pillars about a thousand feet high
and the yard was so full of rosebushes and boxbushes and lilacs
that you couldnt have seen the house if it hadnt been as big as the
Capitol at Washington

Heres where I have to trail says I to myself I thought before
that she seemed to be in moderate circumstances at least This
must be the Governors mansion or the Agricultural Building of a
new Worlds Fair anyhow Id better go back to the village and get
posted by the postmaster or drug the druggist for some information

In the village I found a pine hotel called the Bay View House The
only excuse for the name was a bay horse grazing in the front yard I
set my samplecase down and tried to be ostensible I told the
landlord I was taking orders for plateglass

I dont want no plates says he but I do need another glass
molassespitcher

Byandby I got him down to local gossip and answering questions

Why says he I thought everybody knowed who lived in the big
white house on the hill Its Colonel Allyn the biggest man and the
finest quality in Virginia or anywhere else Theyre the oldest
family in the State That was his daughter that got off the train
Shes been up to Illinois to see her aunt who is sick

I registered at the hotel and on the third day I caught the young
lady walking in the front yard down next to the paling fence I
stopped and raised my hatthere wasnt any other way

Excuse me says I can you tell me where Mr Hinkle lives

She looks at me as cool as if I was the man come to see about the
weeding of the garden but I thought I saw just a slight twinkle of
fun in her eyes

No one of that name lives in Birchton says she That is she
goes on as far as I know Is the gentleman you are seeking white

Well that tickled me No kidding says I Im not looking for
smoke even if I do come from Pittsburgh

You are quite a distance from home says she

Id have gone a thousand miles farther says I

Not if you hadnt waked up when the train started in Shelbyville
says she and then she turned almost as red as one of the roses on
the bushes in the yard I remembered I had dropped off to sleep on a
bench in the Shelbyville station waiting to see which train she took
and only just managed to wake up in time

And then I told her why I had come as respectful and earnest as I
could And I told her everything about myself and what I was making
and how that all I asked was just to get acquainted with her and try
to get her to like me

She smiles a little and blushes some but her eyes never get mixed
up They look straight at whatever shes talking to

I never had any one talk like this to me before Mr Pescud says
she What did you say your name isJohn

John A says I

And you came mighty near missing the train at Powhatan Junction
too says she with a laugh that sounded as good as a mileagebook to
me

How did you know I asked

Men are very clumsy said she I knew you were on every train I
thought you were going to speak to me and Im glad you didnt

Then we had more talk and at last a kind of proud serious look came
on her face and she turned and pointed a finger at the big house

The Allyns says she have lived in Elmcroft for a hundred years
We are a proud family Look at that mansion It has fifty rooms
See the pillars and porches and balconies The ceilings in the
receptionrooms and the ballroom are twentyeight feet high My
father is a lineal descendant of belted earls

I belted one of em once in the Duquesne Hotel in Pittsburgh
says I and he didnt offer to resent it He was there dividing his
attentions between Monongahela whiskey and heiresses and he got
fresh

Of course she goes on my father wouldnt allow a drummer to set
his foot in Elmcroft If he knew that I was talking to one over the
fence he would lock me in my room

Would _you_ let me come there says I Would _you_ talk to me
if I was to call For I goes on if you said I might come and
see you the earls might be belted or suspendered or pinned up with
safetypins as far as I am concerned

I must not talk to you she says because we have not been
introduced It is not exactly proper So I will say goodbye Mr

Say the name says I You havent forgotten it

Pescud says she a little mad

The rest of the name I demands cool as could be

John says she

Johnwhat I says

John A says she with her head high Are you through now

Im coming to see the belted earl tomorrow I says

Hell feed you to his foxhounds says she laughing

If he does itll improve their running says I Im something of
a hunter myself

I must be going in now says she I oughtnt to have spoken to you
at all I hope youll have a pleasant trip back to Minneapolisor
Pittsburgh was it Goodbye

Goodnight says I and it wasnt Minneapolis Whats your name
first please

She hesitated Then she pulled a leaf off a bush and said

My name is Jessie says she

Goodnight Miss Allyn says I

The next morning at eleven sharp I rang the doorbell of that
Worlds Fair main building After about threequarters of an hour an
old nigger man about eighty showed up and asked what I wanted I gave
him my business card and said I wanted to see the colonel He showed
me in

Say did you ever crack open a wormy English walnut Thats what
that house was like There wasnt enough furniture in it to fill an
eightdollar flat Some old horsehair lounges and threelegged chairs
and some framed ancestors on the walls were all that met the eye But
when Colonel Allyn comes in the place seemed to light up You could
almost hear a band playing and see a bunch of oldtimers in wigs
and white stockings dancing a quadrille It was the style of him
although he had on the same shabby clothes I saw him wear at the
station

For about nine seconds he had me rattled and I came mighty near
getting cold feet and trying to sell him some plateglass But I got
my nerve back pretty quick He asked me to sit down and I told him
everything I told him how I followed his daughter from Cincinnati
and what I did it for and all about my salary and prospects and
explained to him my little code of livingto be always decent and
right in your home town and when youre on the road never take more
than four glasses of beer a day or play higher than a twentyfivecent
limit At first I thought he was going to throw me out of the window
but I kept on talking Pretty soon I got a chance to tell him that
story about the Western Congressman who had lost his pocketbook
and the grass widowyou remember that story Well that got him to
laughing and Ill bet that was the first laugh those ancestors and
horsehair sofas had heard in many a day

We talked two hours I told him everything I knew and then he began
to ask questions and I told him the rest All I asked of him was to
give me a chance If I couldnt make a hit with the little lady Id
clear out and not bother any more At last he says

There was a Sir Courtenay Pescud in the time of Charles I if I
remember rightly

If there was says I he cant claim kin with our bunch Weve
always lived in and around Pittsburgh Ive got an uncle in the
realestate business and one in trouble somewhere out in Kansas
You can inquire about any of the rest of us from anybody in old
Smoky Town and get satisfactory replies Did you ever run across
that story about the captain of the whaler who tried to make a
sailor say his prayers says I

It occurs to me that I have never been so fortunate says the
colonel

So I told it to him Laugh I was wishing to myself that he was a
customer What a bill of glass Id sell him And then he says

The relating of anecdotes and humorous occurrences has always seemed
to me Mr Pescud to be a particularly agreeable way of promoting
and perpetuating amenities between friends With your permission I
will relate to you a foxhunting story with which I was personally
connected and which may furnish you some amusement

So he tells it It takes forty minutes by the watch Did I laugh
Well say When I got my face straight he calls in old Pete the
superannuated darky and sends him down to the hotel to bring up my
valise It was Elmcroft for me while I was in the town

Two evenings later I got a chance to speak a word with Miss Jessie
alone on the porch while the colonel was thinking up another story

Its going to be a fine evening says I

Hes coming says she Hes going to tell you this time the
story about the old negro and the green watermelons It always comes
after the one about the Yankees and the game rooster There was
another time she goes on that you nearly got leftit was at
Pulaski City

Yes says I I remember My foot slipped as I was jumping on the
step and I nearly tumbled off

I know says she Andand I_I was afraid you had John A I
was afraid you had_

And then she skips into the house through one of the big windows


IV


Coketown droned the porter making his way through the slowing car

Pescud gathered his hat and baggage with the leisurely promptness of
an old traveller

I married her a year ago said John I told you I built a house in
the East End The beltedI mean the colonelis there too I find
him waiting at the gate whenever I get back from a trip to hear any
new story I might have picked up on the road

I glanced out of the window Coketown was nothing more than a ragged
hillside dotted with a score of black dismal huts propped up against
dreary mounds of slag and clinkers It rained in slanting torrents
too and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black mud to
the railroadtracks

You wont sell much plateglass here John said I Why do you get
off at this endotheworld

Why said Pescud the other day I took Jessie for a little trip to
Philadelphia and coming back she thought she saw some petunias in
a pot in one of those windows over there just like some she used to
raise down in the old Virginia home So I thought Id drop off here
for the night and see if I could dig up some of the cuttings or
blossoms for her Here we are Goodnight old man I gave you the
address Come out and see us when you have time

The train moved forward One of the dotted brown ladies insisted
on having windows raised now that the rain beat against them The
porter came along with his mysterious wand and began to light the car

I glanced downward and saw the bestseller I picked it up and set it
carefully farther along on the floor of the car where the raindrops
would not fall upon it And then suddenly I smiled and seemed to
see that life has no geographical metes and bounds

Goodluck to you Trevelyan I said And may you get the petunias
for your princess




RUS IN URBE


Considering men in relation to money there are three kinds whom I
dislike men who have more money than they can spend men who have
more money than they do spend and men who spend more money than they
have Of the three varieties I believe I have the least liking for
the first But as a man I liked Spencer Grenville North pretty
well although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions
Ive forgotten exactly how many

I did not leave town that summer I usually went down to a village
on the south shore of Long Island The place was surrounded by
duckfarms and the ducks and dogs and whippoorwills and rusty
windmills made so much noise that I could sleep as peacefully as if
I were in my own flat six doors from the elevated railroad in New
York But that summer I did not go Remember that One of my friends
asked me why I did not I replied

Because old man New York is the finest summer resort in the world
You have heard that phrase before But that is what I told him

I was pressagent that year for Binkly  Bing the theatrical managers
and producers Of course you know what a pressagent is Well he is
not That is the secret of being one

Binkly was touring France in his new C  N Williamson car and Bing
had gone to Scotland to learn curling which he seemed to associate in
his mind with hot tongs rather than with ice Before they left they
gave me June and July on salary for my vacation which act was in
accord with their large spirit of liberality But I remained in New
York which I had decided was the finest summer resort in

But I said that before

On July the 10th North came to town from his camp in the Adirondacks
Try to imagine a camp with sixteen rooms plumbing eiderdown quilts
a butler a garage solid silver plate and a longdistance telephone
Of course it was in the woodsif Mr Pinchot wants to preserve the
forests let him give every citizen two or ten or thirty million
dollars and the trees will all gather around the summer camps as the
Birnam woods came to Dunsinane and be preserved

North came to see me in my three rooms and bath extra charge for
light when used extravagantly or all night He slapped me on the back
I would rather have my shins kicked any day and greeted me with
outdoor obstreperousness and revolting good spirits He was
insolently brown and healthylooking and offensively well dressed

Just ran down for a few days said he to sign some papers and
stuff like that My lawyer wired me to come Well you indolent
cockney what are you doing in town I took a chance and telephoned
and they said you were here Whats the matter with that Utopia on
Long Island where you used to take your typewriter and your villainous
temper every summer Anything wrong with theerswans werent
they that used to sing on the farms at night

Ducks said I The songs of swans are for luckier ears They swim
and curve their necks in artificial lakes on the estates of the
wealthy to delight the eyes of the favorites of Fortune

Also in Central Park said North to delight the eyes of immigrants
and bummers Ive seen em there lots of times But why are you in
the city so late in the summer

New York City I began to recite is the finest sum

No you dont said North emphatically You dont spring that old
one on me I know you know better Man you ought to have gone up
with us this summer The Prestons are there and Tom Volney and the
Monroes and Lulu Stanford and the Miss Kennedy and her aunt that you
liked so well

I never liked Miss Kennedys aunt I said

I didnt say you did said North We are having the greatest time
weve ever had The pickerel and trout are so ravenous that I believe
they would swallow your hook with a Montana coppermine prospectus
fastened on it And weve a couple of electric launches and Ill
tell you what we do every night or twowe tow a rowboat behind each
one with a big phonograph and a boy to change the discs in em On
the water and twenty yards behind you they are not so bad And
there are passably good roads through the woods where we go motoring
I shipped two cars up there And the Pinecliff Inn is only three
miles away You know the Pinecliff Some good people are there this
season and we run over to the dances twice a week Cant you go back
with me for a week old man

I laughed Northy said Iif I may be so familiar with a
millionaire because I hate both the names Spencer and Grenvilleyour
invitation is meant kindly butthe city in the summertime for me
Here while the _bourgeoisie_ is away I can live as Nero lived
barring thank heaven the fiddlingwhile the city burns at ninety
in the shade The tropics and the zones wait upon me like handmaidens
I sit under Florida palms and eat pomegranates while Boreas himself
electrically conjured up blows upon me his Arctic breath As for
trout you know yourself that Jean at Maurices cooks them better
than any one else in the world

Be advised said North My chef has pinched the blue ribbon from
the lot He lays some slices of bacon inside the trout wraps it all
in cornhusksthe husks of green corn you knowburies them in hot
ashes and covers them with live coals We build fires on the bank of
the lake and have fish suppers

I know said I And the servants bring down tables and chairs and
damask cloths and you eat with silver forks I know the kind of
camps that you millionaires have And there are champagne pails set
about disgracing the wild flowers and no doubt Madame Tetrazzini
to sing in the boat pavilion after the trout

Oh no said North concernedly we were never as bad as that We
did have a variety troupe up from the city three or four nights but
they werent stars by as far as light can travel in the same length
of time I always like a few home comforts even when Im roughing it
But dont tell me you prefer to stay in the city during summer I
dont believe it If you do why did you spend your summers there for
the last four years even sneaking away from town on a night train
and refusing to tell your friends where this Arcadian village was

Because said I they might have followed me and discovered it
But since then I have learned that Amaryllis has come to town The
coolest things the freshest the brightest the choicest are to be
found in the city If youve nothing on hand this evening I will show
you

Im free said North and I have my light car outside I suppose
since youve been converted to the town that your idea of rural sport
is to have a little whirl between bicycle cops in Central Park and
then a mug of sticky ale in some stuffy rathskeller under a fan that
cant stir up as many revolutions in a week as Nicaragua can in a
day

Well begin with the spin through the Park anyhow I said I was
choking with the hot stale air of my little apartment and I wanted
that breath of the cool to brace me for the task of proving to my
friend that New York was the greatestand so forth

Where can you find air any fresher or purer than this I asked as
we sped into Centrals boskiest dell

Air said North contemptuously Do you call this airthis muggy
vapor smelling of garbage and gasoline smoke Man I wish you could
get one sniff of the real Adirondack article in the pine woods at
daylight

I have heard of it said I But for fragrance and tang and a joy
in the nostrils I would not give one puff of sea breeze across the
bay down on my little boat dock on Long Island for ten of your
turpentinescented tornadoes

Then why asked North a little curiously dont you go there
instead of staying cooped up in this Greater Bakery

Because said I doggedly I have discovered that New York is the
greatest summer

Dont say that again interrupted North unless youve actually got
a job as General Passenger Agent of the Subway You cant really
believe it

I went to some trouble to try to prove my theory to my friend The
Weather Bureau and the season had conspired to make the argument
worthy of an able advocate

The city seemed stretched on a broiler directly above the furnaces
of Avernus There was a kind of tepid gayety afoot and awheel in the
boulevards mainly evinced by languid men strolling about in straw
hats and evening clothes and rows of idle taxicabs with their flags
up looking like a blockaded Fourth of July procession The hotels
kept up a specious brilliancy and hospitable outlook but inside one
saw vast empty caverns and the footrails at the bars gleamed brightly
from long disacquaintance with the soleleather of customers In
the crosstown streets the steps of the old brownstone houses were
swarming with stoopers that motley race hailing from skylight room
and basement bringing out their straw doorstep mats to sit and fill
the air with strange noises and opinions

North and I dined on the top of a hotel and here for a few minutes
I thought I had made a score An east wind almost cool blew across
the roofless roof A capable orchestra concealed in a bower of
wistaria played with sufficient judgment to make the art of music
probable and the art of conversation possible

Some ladies in reproachless summer gowns at other tables gave
animation and color to the scene And an excellent dinner mainly
from the refrigerator seemed to successfully back my judgment as to
summer resorts But North grumbled all during the meal and cursed
his lawyers and prated so of his confounded camp in the woods that I
began to wish he would go back there and leave me in my peaceful city
retreat

After dining we went to a roofgarden vaudeville that was being
much praised There we found a good bill an artificially cooled
atmosphere cold drinks prompt service and a gay welldressed
audience North was bored

If this isnt comfortable enough for you on the hottest August night
for five years I said a little sarcastically you might think
about the kids down in Delancey and Hester streets lying out on the
fireescapes with their tongues hanging out trying to get a breath of
air that hasnt been fried on both sides The contrast might increase
your enjoyment

Dont talk Socialism said North I gave five hundred dollars to
the free ice fund on the first of May Im contrasting these stale
artificial hollow wearisome amusements with the enjoyment a
man can get in the woods You should see the firs and pines do
skirtdances during a storm and lie down flat and drink out of a
mountain branch at the end of a days tramp after the deer Thats
the only way to spend a summer Get out and live with nature

I agree with you absolutely said I with emphasis

For one moment I had relaxed my vigilance and had spoken my true
sentiments North looked at me long and curiously

Then why in the name of Pan and Apollo he asked have you been
singing this deceitful paean to summer in town

I suppose I looked my guilt

Ha said North I see May I ask her name

Annie Ashton said I simply She played Nannette in Binkley 
Bings production of The Silver Cord She is to have a better part
next season

Take me to see her said North

Miss Ashton lived with her mother in a small hotel They were out
of the West and had a little money that bridged the seasons As
pressagent of Binkley  Bing I had tried to keep her before the
public As Robert James Vandiver I had hoped to withdraw her for if
ever one was made to keep company with said Vandiver and smell the
salt breeze on the south shore of Long Island and listen to the ducks
quack in the watches of the night it was the Ashton set forth above

But she had a soul above ducksabove nightingales aye even above
birds of paradise She was very beautiful with quiet ways and
seemed genuine She had both taste and talent for the stage and she
liked to stay at home and read and make caps for her mother She was
unvaryingly kind and friendly with Binkley  Bings pressagent
Since the theatre had closed she had allowed Mr Vandiver to call in
an unofficial role I had often spoken to her of my friend Spencer
Grenville North and so as it was early the first turn of the
vaudeville being not yet over we left to find a telephone

Miss Ashton would be very glad to see Mr Vandiver and Mr North

We found her fitting a new cap on her mother I never saw her look
more charming

North made himself disagreeably entertaining He was a good talker
and had a way with him Besides he had two ten or thirty millions
Ive forgotten which I incautiously admired the mothers cap
whereupon she brought out her store of a dozen or two and I took a
course in edgings and frills Even though Annies fingers had pinked
or ruched or hemmed or whatever you do to em they palled upon me
And I could hear North drivelling to Annie about his odious Adirondack
camp

Two days after that I saw North in his motorcar with Miss Ashton and
her mother On the next afternoon he dropped in on me

Bobby said he this old burg isnt such a bad proposition in the
summertime after all Since Ive keen knocking around it looks
better to me There are some firstrate musical comedies and light
operas on the roofs and in the outdoor gardens And if you hunt up
the right places and stick to soft drinks you can keep about as cool
here as you can in the country Hang it when you come to think of
it theres nothing much to the country anyhow You get tired and
sunburned and lonesome and you have to eat any old thing that the
cook dishes up to you

It makes a difference doesnt it said I

It certainly does Now I found some whitebait yesterday at
Maurices with a new sauce that beats anything in the trout line I
ever tasted

It makes a difference doesnt it I said

Immense The sauce is the main thing with whitebait

It makes a difference doesnt it I asked looking him straight in
the eye He understood

Look here Bob he said I was going to tell you I couldnt help
it Ill play fair with you but Im going in to win She is the
one particular for me

All right said I Its a fair field There are no rights for you
to encroach upon

On Thursday afternoon Miss Ashton invited North and myself to have
tea in her apartment He was devoted and she was more charming
than usual By avoiding the subject of caps I managed to get a
word or two into and out of the talk Miss Ashton asked me in a
makeconversational tone something about the next seasons tour

Oh said I I dont know about that Im not going to be with
Binkley  Bing next season

Why I thought said she that they were going to put the Number
One road company under your charge I thought you told me so

They were said I but they wont Ill tell you what Im going
to do Im going to the south shore of Long Island and buy a small
cottage I know there on the edge of the bay And Ill buy a catboat
and a rowboat and a shotgun and a yellow dog Ive got money enough
to do it And Ill smell the salt wind all day when it blows from the
sea and the pine odor when it blows from the land And of course
Ill write plays until I have a trunk full of em on hand

And the next thing and the biggest thing Ill do will be to buy that
duckfarm next door Few people understand ducks I can watch em
for hours They can march better than any company in the National
Guard and they can play follow my leader better than the entire
Democratic party Their voices dont amount to much but I like to
hear em They wake you up a dozen times a night but theres a
homely sound about their quacking that is more musical to me than the
cry of Fresh strawberrees under your window in the morning when
you want to sleep

And I went on enthusiastically do you know the value of ducks
besides their beauty and intelligence and order and sweetness of
voice Picking their feathers gives you an unfailing and neverceasing
income On a farm that I know the feathers were sold for 400 in one
year Think of that And the ones shipped to the market will bring
in more money than that Yes I am for the ducks and the salt breeze
coming over the bay I think I shall get a Chinaman cook and with him
and the dog and the sunsets for company I shall do well No more of
this dull baking senseless roaring city for me

Miss Ashton looked surprised North laughed

I am going to begin one of my plays tonight I said so I must be
going And with that I took my departure

A few days later Miss Ashton telephoned to me asking me to call at
four in the afternoon

I did

You have been very good to me she said hesitatingly and I
thought I would tell you I am going to leave the stage

Yes said I I suppose you will They usually do when theres so
much money

There is no money she said or very little Our money is almost
gone

But I am told said I that he has something like two or ten or
thirty millionsI have forgotten which

I know what you mean she said I will not pretend that I do not
I am not going to marry Mr North

Then why are you leaving the stage I asked severely What else
can you do to earn a living

She came closer to me and I can see the look in her eyes yet as she
spoke

I can pick ducks she said

We sold the first years feathers for 350




A POOR RULE


I have always maintained and asserted time to time that woman is
no mystery that man can foretell construe subdue comprehend and
interpret her That she is a mystery has been foisted by herself
upon credulous mankind Whether I am right or wrong we shall see As
Harpers Drawer used to say in bygone years The following good
story is told of Miss  Mr  Mr  and Mr 

We shall have to omit Bishop X and the Rev  for they do not
belong

In those days Paloma was a new town on the line of the Southern
Pacific A reporter would have called it a mushroom town but it
was not Paloma was first and last of the toadstool variety

The train stopped there at noon for the engine to drink and for the
passengers both to drink and to dine There was a new yellowpine
hotel also a wool warehouse and perhaps three dozen box residences
The rest was composed of tents cow ponies blackwaxy mud
and mesquitetrees all bound round by a horizon Paloma was an
abouttobe city The houses represented faith the tents hope the
twiceaday train by which you might leave creditably sustained
the role of charity

The Parisian Restaurant occupied the muddiest spot in the town while
it rained and the warmest when it shone It was operated owned and
perpetrated by a citizen known as Old Man Hinkle who had come out
of Indiana to make his fortune in this land of condensed milk and
sorghum

There was a fourroom unpainted weatherboarded box house in which
the family lived From the kitchen extended a shelter made of poles
covered with chaparral brush Under this was a table and two benches
each twenty feet long the product of Paloma home carpentry Here
was set forth the roast mutton the stewed apples boiled beans
sodabiscuits puddinorpie and hot coffee of the Parisian menu

Ma Hinkle and a subordinate known to the ears as Betty but denied
to the eyesight presided at the range Pa Hinkle himself with
salamandrous thumbs served the scalding viands During rush hours a
Mexican youth who rolled and smoked cigarettes between courses aided
him in waiting on the guests As is customary at Parisian banquets I
place the sweets at the end of my wordy menu

Ileen Hinkle

The spelling is correct for I have seen her write it No doubt she
had been named by ear but she so splendidly bore the orthography
that Tom Moore himself had he seen her would have endorsed the
phonography

Ileen was the daughter of the house and the first Lady Cashier to
invade the territory south of an eastandwest line drawn through
Galveston and Del Rio She sat on a high stool in a rough pine
grandstandor was it a templeunder the shelter at the door of
the kitchen There was a barbedwire protection in front of her with
a little arch under which you passed your money Heaven knows why the
barbed wire for every man who dined Parisianly there would have died
in her service Her duties were light each meal was a dollar you
put it under the arch and she took it

I set out with the intent to describe Ileen Hinkle to you Instead I
must refer you to the volume by Edmund Burke entitled _A Philosophical
Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful_
It is an exhaustive treatise dealing first with the primitive
conceptions of beautyroundness and smoothness I think they are
according to Burke It is well said Rotundity is a patent charm as
for smoothnessthe more new wrinkles a woman acquires the smoother
she becomes

Ileen was a strictly vegetable compound guaranteed under the Pure
Ambrosia and BalmofGilead Act of the year of the fall of Adam She
was a fruitstand blondestrawberries peaches cherries etc Her
eyes were wide apart and she possessed the calm that precedes a storm
that never comes But it seems to me that words at any rate per are
wasted in an effort to describe the beautiful Like fancy It is
engendered in the eyes There are three kinds of beautiesI was
foreordained to be homiletic I can never stick to a story

The first is the frecklefaced snubnosed girl whom you like The
second is Maud Adams The third is or are the ladies in Bouguereaus
paintings Ileen Hinkle was the fourth She was the mayoress of
Spotless Town There were a thousand golden apples coming to her as
Helen of the Troy laundries

The Parisian Restaurant was within a radius Even from beyond its
circumference men rode in to Paloma to win her smiles They got them
One mealone smileone dollar But with all her impartiality
Ileen seemed to favor three of her admirers above the rest According
to the rules of politeness I will mention myself last

The first was an artificial product known as Bryan Jacksa name
that had obviously met with reverses Jacks was the outcome of paved
cities He was a small man made of some material resembling flexible
sandstone His hair was the color of a brick Quaker meetinghouse
his eyes were twin cranberries his mouth was like the aperture under
a droplettershere sign

He knew every city from Bangor to San Francisco thence north to
Portland thence S 45 E to a given point in Florida He had mastered
every art trade game business profession and sport in the world
had been present at or hurrying on his way to every headline event
that had ever occurred between oceans since he was five years old You
might open the atlas place your finger at random upon the name of
a town and Jacks would tell you the front names of three prominent
citizens before you could close it again He spoke patronizingly and
even disrespectfully of Broadway Beacon Hill Michigan Euclid and
Fifth avenues and the St Louis Four Courts Compared with him as a
cosmopolite the Wandering Jew would have seemed a mere hermit He had
learned everything the world could teach him and he would tell you
about it

I hate to be reminded of Polloks Course of Time and so do you
but every time I saw Jacks I would think of the poets description
of another poet by the name of G G Byron who Drank early deeply
drankdrank draughts that common millions might have quenched then
died of thirst because there was no more to drink

That fitted Jacks except that instead of dying he came to Paloma
which was about the same thing He was a telegrapher and stationand
expressagent at seventyfive dollars a month Why a young man who
knew everything and could do everything was content to serve in such
an obscure capacity I never could understand although he let out
a hint once that it was as a personal favor to the president and
stockholders of the S P Ry Co

One more line of description and I turn Jacks over to you He wore
bright blue clothes yellow shoes and a bow tie made of the same
cloth as his shirt

My rival No2 was Bud Cunningham whose services had been engaged by
a ranch near Paloma to assist in compelling refractory cattle to keep
within the bounds of decorum and order Bud was the only cowboy off
the stage that I ever saw who looked like one on it He wore the
sombrero the chaps and the handkerchief tied at the back of his
neck

Twice a week Bud rode in from the Val Verde Ranch to sup at the
Parisian Restaurant He rode a manyhighhanded Kentucky horse at a
tremendously fast lope which animal he would rein up so suddenly
under the big mesquite at the corner of the brush shelter that his
hoofs would plough canals yards long in the loam

Jacks and I were regular boarders at the restaurant of course

The front room of the Hinkle House was as neat a little parlor as
there was in the blackwaxy country It was all willow rockingchairs
and homeknit tidies and albums and conch shells in a row And a
little upright piano in one corner

Here Jacks and Bud and Ior sometimes one or two of us according
to our goodluckused to sit of evenings when the tide of trade was
over and visit Miss Hinkle

Ileen was a girl of ideas She was destined for higher things if
there can be anything higher than taking in dollars all day through a
barbedwire wicket She had read and listened and thought Her looks
would have formed a career for a less ambitious girl but rising
superior to mere beauty she must establish something in the nature of
a _salon_the only one in Paloma

Dont you think that Shakespeare was a great writer she would ask
with such a pretty little knit of her arched brows that the late
Ignatius Donnelly himself had he seen it could scarcely have saved
his Bacon

Ileen was of the opinion also that Boston is more cultured than
Chicago that Rosa Bonheur was one of the greatest of women painters
that Westerners are more spontaneous and openhearted than Easterners
that London must be a very foggy city and that California must be
quite lovely in the springtime And of many other opinions indicating
a keeping up with the worlds best thought

These however were but gleaned from hearsay and evidence Ileen
had theories of her own One in particular she disseminated to us
untiringly Flattery she detested Frankness and honesty of speech
and action she declared were the chief mental ornaments of man
and woman If ever she could like any one it would be for those
qualities

Im awfully weary she said one evening when we three musketeers
of the mesquite were in the little parlor of having compliments on
my looks paid to me I know Im not beautiful

Bud Cunningham told me afterward that it was all he could do to keep
from calling her a liar when she said that

Im only a little MiddleWestern girl went on Ileen who just
wants to be simple and neat and tries to help her father make a
humble living

Old Man Hinkle was shipping a thousand silver dollars a month clear
profit to a bank in San Antonio

Bud twisted around in his chair and bent the rim of his hat from
which he could never be persuaded to separate He did not know
whether she wanted what she said she wanted or what she knew she
deserved Many a wiser man has hesitated at deciding Bud decided

Whyah Miss Ileen beauty as you might say aint everything Not
sayin that you havent your share of good looks I always admired
more than anything else about you the nice kind way you treat your
ma and pa Any one whats good to their parents and is a kind of
homebody dont specially need to be too pretty

Ileen gave him one of her sweetest smiles Thank you Mr
Cunningham she said I consider that one of the finest compliments
Ive had in a long time Id so much rather hear you say that than to
hear you talk about my eyes and hair Im glad you believe me when I
say I dont like flattery

Our cue was there for us Bud had made a good guess You couldnt
lose Jacks He chimed in next

Sure thing Miss Ileen he said the goodlookers dont always win
out Now you aint bad looking of coursebut thats nixcumrous
I knew a girl once in Dubuque with a face like a cocoanut who could
skin the cat twice on a horizontal bar without changing hands Now a
girl might have the California peach crop mashed to a marmalade and
not be able to do that Ive seenerworse lookers than _you_ Miss
Ileen but what I like about you is the business way youve got of
doing things Cool and wisethats the winning way for a girl Mr
Hinkle told me the other day youd never taken in a lead silver dollar
or a plugged one since youve been on the job Now thats the stuff
for a girlthats what catches me

Jacks got his smile too

Thank you Mr Jacks said Ileen If you only knew how I
appreciate any ones being candid and not a flatterer I get so tired
of people telling me Im pretty I think it is the loveliest thing to
have friends who tell you the truth

Then I thought I saw an expectant look on Ileens face as she glanced
toward me I had a wild sudden impulse to dare fate and tell her of
all the beautiful handiwork of the Great Artificer she was the most
exquisitethat she was a flawless pearl gleaming pure and serene in a
setting of black mud and emerald prairiesthat she wasaa corker
and as for mine I cared not if she were as cruel as a serpents
tooth to her fond parents or if she couldnt tell a plugged dollar
from a bridle buckle if I might sing chant praise glorify and
worship her peerless and wonderful beauty

But I refrained I feared the fate of a flatterer I had witnessed
her delight at the crafty and discreet words of Bud and Jacks No
Miss Hinkle was not one to be beguiled by the platedsilver tongue of
a flatterer So I joined the ranks of the candid and honest At once
I became mendacious and didactic

In all ages Miss Hinkle said I in spite of the poetry and
romance of each intellect in woman has been admired more than beauty
Even in Cleopatra herself men found more charm in her queenly mind
than in her looks

Well I should think so said Ileen Ive seen pictures of her
that werent so much She had an awfully long nose

If I may say so I went on you remind me of Cleopatra Miss
Ileen

Why my nose isnt so long said she opening her eyes wide and
touching that comely feature with a dimpled forefinger

WhyerI mean said II mean as to mental endowments

Oh said she and then I got my smile just as Bud and Jacks had got
theirs

Thank every one of you she said very very sweetly for being
so frank and honest with me Thats the way I want you to be always
Just tell me plainly and truthfully what you think and well all be
the best friends in the world And now because youve been so good
to me and understand so well how I dislike people who do nothing but
pay me exaggerated compliments Ill sing and play a little for you

Of course we expressed our thanks and joy but we would have been
better pleased if Ileen had remained in her low rockingchair face to
face with us and let us gaze upon her For she was no Adelina Patti
not even on the farewellest of the divas farewell tours She had a
cooing little voice like that of a turtledove that could almost fill
the parlor when the windows and doors were closed and Betty was not
rattling the lids of the stove in the kitchen She had a gamut that I
estimate at about eight inches on the piano and her runs and trills
sounded like the clothes bubbling in your grandmothers iron washpot
Believe that she must have been beautiful when I tell you that it
sounded like music to us

Ileens musical taste was catholic She would sing through a pile of
sheet music on the lefthand top of the piano laying each slaughtered
composition on the righthand top The next evening she would sing
from right to left Her favorites were Mendelssohn and Moody and
Sankey By request she always wound up with Sweet Violets and When
the Leaves Begin to Turn

When we left at ten oclock the three of us would go down to Jacks
little wooden station and sit on the platform swinging our feet and
trying to pump one another for clews as to which way Miss Ileens
inclinations seemed to lean That is the way of rivalsthey do
not avoid and glower at one another they convene and converse and
construestriving by the art politic to estimate the strength of the
enemy

One day there came a dark horse to Paloma a young lawyer who at once
flaunted his shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town His
name was C Vincent Vesey You could see at a glance that he was a
recent graduate of a southwestern law school His Prince Albert coat
light striped trousers broadbrimmed soft black hat and narrow white
muslin bow tie proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could
Vesey was a compound of Daniel Webster Lord Chesterfield Beau
Brummell and Little Jack Horner His coming boomed Paloma The next
day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off
in lots

Of course Vesey to further his professional fortunes must mingle
with the citizenry and outliers of Paloma And as well as with the
soldier men he was bound to seek popularity with the gay dogs of the
place So Jacks and Bud Cunningham and I came to be honored by his
acquaintance

The doctrine of predestination would have been discredited had
not Vesey seen Ileen Hinkle and become fourth in the tourney
Magnificently he boarded at the yellow pine hotel instead of at the
Parisian Restaurant but he came to be a formidable visitor in the
Hinkle parlor His competition reduced Bud to an inspired increase
of profanity drove Jacks to an outburst of slang so weird that it
sounded more horrible than the most trenchant of Buds imprecations
and made me dumb with gloom

For Vesey had the rhetoric Words flowed from him like oil from
a gusher Hyperbole compliment praise appreciation honeyed
gallantry golden opinions eulogy and unveiled panegyric vied with
one another for preeminence in his speech We had small hopes that
Ileen could resist his oratory and Prince Albert

But a day came that gave us courage

About dusk one evening I was sitting on the little gallery in front
of the Hinkle parlor waiting for Ileen to come when I heard voices
inside She had come into the room with her father and Old Man
Hinkle began to talk to her I had observed before that he was a
shrewd man and not unphilosophic

Ily said he I notice theres three or four young fellers that
have been callin to see you regular for quite a while Is there any
one of em you like better than another

Why pa she answered I like all of em very well I think Mr
Cunningham and Mr Jacks and Mr Harris are very nice young men They
are so frank and honest in everything they say to me I havent known
Mr Vesey very long but I think hes a very nice young man hes so
frank and honest in everything he says to me

Now thats what Im gittin at says old Hinkle Youve always
been sayin you like people what tell the truth and dont go
humbuggin you with compliments and bogus talk Now suppose you
make a test of these fellers and see which one of em will talk the
straightest to you

But howll I do it pa

Ill tell you how You know you sing a little bit Ily you took
musiclessons nearly two years in Logansport It wasnt long but it
was all we could afford then And your teacher said you didnt have
any voice and it was a waste of money to keep on Now suppose you
ask the fellers what they think of your singin and see what each
one of em tells you The man thatll tell you the truth about itll
have a mighty lot of nerve and ll do to tie to What do you think
of the plan

All right pa said Ileen I think its a good idea Ill try
it

Ileen and Mr Hinkle went out of the room through the inside doors
Unobserved I hurried down to the station Jacks was at his telegraph
table waiting for eight oclock to come It was Buds night in town
and when he rode in I repeated the conversation to them both I was
loyal to my rivals as all true admirers of all Ileens should be

Simultaneously the three of us were smitten by an uplifting thought
Surely this test would eliminate Vesey from the contest He with his
unctuous flattery would be driven from the lists Well we remembered
Ileens love of frankness and honestyhow she treasured truth and
candor above vain compliment and blandishment

Linking arms we did a grotesque dance of joy up and down the
platform singing Muldoon Was a Solid Man at the top of our voices

That evening four of the willow rockingchairs were filled besides the
lucky one that sustained the trim figure of Miss Hinkle Three of us
awaited with suppressed excitement the application of the test It
was tried on Bud first

Mr Cunningham said Ileen with her dazzling smile after she had
sung When the Leaves Begin to Turn what do you really think of my
voice Frankly and honestly now as you know I want you to always be
toward me

Bud squirmed in his chair at his chance to show the sincerity that he
knew was required of him

Tell you the truth Miss Ileen he said earnestly you aint got
much more voice than a weaseljust a little squeak you know Of
course we all like to hear you sing for its kind of sweet and
soothin after all and you look most as mighty well sittin on the
pianostool as you do faced around But as for real singinI reckon
you couldnt call it that

I looked closely at Ileen to see if Bud had overdone his frankness
but her pleased smile and sweetly spoken thanks assured me that we
were on the right track

And what do you think Mr Jacks she asked next

Take it from me said Jacks you aint in the prima donna class
Ive heard em warble in every city in the United States and I tell
you your vocal output dont go Otherwise youve got the grand
opera bunch sent to the soap factoryin looks I mean for the high
screechers generally look like Mary Ann on her Thursday out But nix
for the gargle work Your epiglottis aint a real sidestepperits
footwork aint good

With a merry laugh at Jacks criticism Ileen looked inquiringly at
me

I admit that I faltered a little Was there not such a thing as being
too frank Perhaps I even hedged a little in my verdict but I stayed
with the critics

I am not skilled in scientific music Miss Ileen I said but
frankly I cannot praise very highly the singingvoice that Nature has
given you It has long been a favorite comparison that a great singer
sings like a bird Well there are birds and birds I would say that
your voice reminds me of the thrushsthroaty and not strong nor of
much compass or varietybut stillersweetineritsway and
er

Thank you Mr Harris interrupted Miss Hinkle I knew I could
depend upon your frankness and honesty

And then C Vincent Vesey drew back one sleeve from his snowy cuff
and the water came down at Lodore

My memory cannot do justice to his masterly tribute to that priceless
Godgiven treasureMiss Hinkles voice He raved over it in terms
that if they had been addressed to the morning stars when they sang
together would have made that stellar choir explode in a meteoric
shower of flaming selfsatisfaction

He marshalled on his white fingertips the grand opera stars of all
the continents from Jenny Lind to Emma Abbott only to depreciate
their endowments He spoke of larynxes of chest notes of phrasing
arpeggios and other strange paraphernalia of the throaty art He
admitted as though driven to a corner that Jenny Lind had a note or
two in the high register that Miss Hinkle had not yet acquiredbut
that was a mere matter of practice and training

And as a peroration he predictedsolemnly predicteda career in
vocal art for the coming star of the Southwestand one of which
grand old Texas may well be proud hitherto unsurpassed in the annals
of musical history

When we left at ten Ileen gave each of us her usual warm cordial
handshake entrancing smile and invitation to call again I could
not see that one was favored above or below anotherbut three of us
knewwe knew

We knew that frankness and honesty had won and that the rivals now
numbered three instead of four

Down at the station Jacks brought out a pint bottle of the proper
stuff and we celebrated the downfall of a blatant interloper

Four days went by without anything happening worthy of recount

On the fifth Jacks and I entering the brush arbor for our supper
saw the Mexican youth instead of a divinity in a spotless waist and a
navyblue skirt taking in the dollars through the barbedwire wicket

We rushed into the kitchen meeting Pa Hinkle coming out with two cups
of hot coffee in his hands

Wheres Ileen we asked in recitative

Pa Hinkle was a kindly man Well gents said he it was a sudden
notion she took but Ive got the money and I let her have her way
Shes gone to a corna conservatory in Boston for four years for to
have her voice cultivated Now excuse me to pass gents for this
coffees hot and my thumbs is tender

That night there were four instead of three of us sitting on the
station platform and swinging our feet C Vincent Vesey was one of
us We discussed things while dogs barked at the moon that rose as
big as a fivecent piece or a flour barrel over the chaparral

And what we discussed was whether it is better to lie to a woman or
to tell her the truth

And as all of us were young then we did not come to a decision

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
