AfghanistanEconomy

Economyoverview Afghanistan is an extremely poor landlocked
country highly dependent on farming and livestock raising sheep and
goats Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political
and military upheavals during more than 18 years of war including the
nearly 10year Soviet military occupation which ended 15 February
1989 During the war onethird of the population fled the country
with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6
million refugees Now only 750000 registered Afghan refugees remain
in Pakistan and about 12 million in Iran Another 1 million have
probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan Gross
domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 18 years
because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade
and transport Much of the population continues to suffer from
insufficient food clothing housing and medical care Inflation
remains a serious problem throughout the country with one estimate
putting the rate at 240 in Kabul in 1996 Numerical data are likely
to be either unavailable or unreliable

AlbaniaEconomy

Economyoverview An extremely poor country by European standards
Albania is making the difficult transition to a more openmarket
economy The economy rebounded in 199395 after a severe depression
accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in
1990 and 1991 However a weakening of government resolve to maintain
stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to
renewal of inflationary pressures spurred by the budget deficit which
exceeded 12 The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early
1997which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of
Albanias adult population  triggered severe social unrest which led
to more than 1500 deaths widespread destruction of property and an
8 drop in GDP The new government installed in July 1997 has taken
strong measures to restore public order and to revive economic
activity and trade The economy continues to be bolstered by
remittances of some 20 of the labor force which works abroad mostly
in Greece and Italy These remittances supplement GDP and help offset
the large foreign trade deficit Most agricultural land was privatized
in 1992 substantially improving peasant incomes

AlgeriaEconomy

Economyoverview The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the
economy accounting for roughly 57 of government revenues 25 of
GDP and almost all export earnings Algeria has the fifthlargest
reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas
exporter it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves Algiers efforts to
reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world
began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the country
into a severe recession In 1989 the government launched a
comprehensive IMFsupported program to achieve economic stabilization
and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy Despite
substantial progress toward economic adjustment in 1992 the reform
drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil In
September 1993 a new government was formed and one priority was the
resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process
Burdened with a heavy foreign debt Algiers concluded a oneyear
standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994 and the following year
signed onto a threeyear extended fund facility Progress on economic
reform a Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995 and oil and gas sector
expansion have contributed to a recovery since 1995 Investments in
developing hydrocarbon resources are likely to maintain growth and
export earnings Continuing but gradual government efforts to attract
foreign and domestic investment outside that sector seek to diversify
the economy and tackle problems of high unemployment and falling
living standards problems as yet untouched by the macroeconomic
turnaround

Economyoverview This is a traditional Polynesian economy in which
more than 90 of the land is communally owned Economic activity is
strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa conducts the
great bulk of its foreign trade Tuna fishing and tuna processing
plants are the backbone of the private sector with canned tuna the
primary export Transfers from the US Government add substantially to
American Samoas economic wellbeing According to one observer
attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are
restrained by Samoas remote location its limited transportation and
its devastating hurricanes Tourism a developing sector may be held
back in 1998 by the financial difficulties in East Asia

AndorraEconomy

Economyoverview Tourism the mainstay of Andorras tiny welltodo
economy accounts for roughly 80 of GDP An estimated 10 million
tourists visit annually attracted by Andorras dutyfree status and
by its summer and winter resorts Andorras comparative advantage has
recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain have
been opened up providing broader availability of goods and lower
tariffs The banking sector with its tax haven status also
contributes substantially to the economy Agricultural production is
limited by a scarcity of arable land and most food has to be
imported The principal livestock activity is sheep raising
Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes cigars and furniture
Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU
member for trade in manufactured goods no tariffs and as a nonEU
member for agricultural products

Introduction

Current issues Civil war has been the norm since independence from
Portugal on 11 November 1975 A ceasefire between the government and
UNITA lasted from 31 May 1991 until October 1992 when UNITA refused
to accept its defeat in internationally monitored elections and
fighting resumed throughout much of the country The two sides signed
another peace accord on 20 November 1994 and the ceasefire is
generally holding but military tensions and banditry persist The
peace accord provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents
into the Angolan armed forces and the government A Government of
National Unity and Reconciliation was installed in April 1997 and
military integration was declared complete in June 1997 although
UNITA filled fewer than half of the military positions allocated to
the rebels Efforts which began in May 1997 to extend government into
UNITAoccupied areas are proceeding slowly The original 7200man UN
peacekeeping force began a phased drawdown in late 1996 and all UN
military components are scheduled to depart by 30 June 1998 except for
through 1998

AngolaEconomy

Economyoverview Angola is an economy in disarray because of more
than 20 years of nearly continuous warfare Despite its abundant
natural resources output per capita is among the worlds lowest
Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85 of the
population Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to
the economy contributing about 50 to GDP Notwithstanding the
signing of a peace accord in November 1994 sporadic violence
continues millions of land mines remain and many farmers are
reluctant to return to their fields As a result much of the
countrys food must still be imported To take advantage of its rich
resourcesgold diamonds extensive forests Atlantic fisheries
arable land and large oil depositsAngola will need to implement the
peace agreement and reform government policies Despite the high
inflation and political difficulties total output grew an estimated
9 in 1996 largely due to increased oil production and higher oil
prices

Economyoverview Tourism continues to be by far the dominant activity
in the economy accounting directly or indirectly to more than half of
GDP Increased tourist arrivals have helped spur growth in the
construction and transport sectors The dual island nations
agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market the
sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages
that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction
Manufacturing comprises enclavetype assembly for export with major
products being bedding handicrafts and electronic components
Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to
depend on income growth in the industrialized world especially in the
US which accounts for about half of all tourist arrivals

ArgentinaEconomy

Economyoverview Argentina benefits from rich natural resources a
highly literate population an exportoriented agricultural sector
and a diversified industrial base Nevertheless following decades of
mismanagement and statist policies the economy in the late 1980s was
plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of
hyperinflation Elected in 1989 in the depths of recession President
MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program
that has put Argentina on a path of stable sustainable growth
Argentinas currency has traded at par with the US dollar since April
1991 and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 50 years
Argentines have responded to price stability by repatriating capital
and investing in domestic industry Growth averaged more than 8
between 1991 and 1994 then fell 46 in 1995 largely in reaction to
the Mexican peso crisis The economy has since recovered strongly
However unemployment remains nearly 14 and Buenos Aires still
depends on foreign capital to meet the bulk of its financing needs
The IMF has urged additional economic reforms to ensure equitable
longterm growth

Introduction

Current issues Armenias leaders remain preoccupied by Armenias
10year conflict with Azerbaijan over the NagornoKarabakh enclave
Although a ceasefire has been in effect since May 1994 the sides
have not made substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution In
January 1998 differences between President TERPETROSSIAN and members
of his cabinet over the NagornoKarabakh peace process came to a head
With the prime minister and defense and security ministers arrayed
against him an isolated TERPETROSSIAN resigned the presidency on 3
February 1998 Robert KOCHARIAN TERPETROSSIANs prime minister was
elected president in March 1998 Concerns about Armenias economic
performance rose in 1997 with a slowdown in growth and an increase in
inflation

ArmeniaEconomy

Economyoverview Under the old Soviet central planning system
Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector supplying machine
tools textiles and other manufactured goods to sister republics in
exchange for raw materials and energy Since the implosion of the USSR
in December 1991 Armenia has switched to smallscale agriculture away
from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet area The
agricultural sector has longterm needs for more investment and
updated technology The privatization of industry has been at a slower
pace but ahead of most of the rest of the CIS Armenia is a food
importer and its mineral deposits gold bauxite are small The
ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armeniandominated
region of NagornoKarabakh and the embargoes imposed by Azerbaijan and
Turkey contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s By
1994 however the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious
IMFsponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth
rates in 199597 Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to
privatize most small and mediumsized enterprises The chronic energy
shortages Armenia suffered in recent years has been partially offset
by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor
which in 1996 supplied about 40 of the countrys energy needs
according to the Armenian Government Moreover Armenia is expanding
its energy imports from Iran

AustraliaEconomy

Economyoverview Australia has a prosperous Westernstyle capitalist
economy with a per capita GDP at the level of the highly
industrialized West European countries Rich in natural resources
Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products minerals
metals and fossil fuels Commodities account for 57 of the value of
total exports so that a downturn in world commodity prices can have a
big impact on the economy The government is pushing for increased
exports of manufactured goods but competition in international
markets continues to be severe Australia has suffered from the low
growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the
early 1990s but the economy has expanded at reasonably steady rates
in recent years In addition to high unemployment shortterm economic
problems include a balancing of output growth and inflationary
pressures and the stimulation of exports to offset rising imports
especially given the economic crisis in Asia

AzerbaijanEconomy

Economyoverview Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than
either Armenia or Georgia the other Transcaucasian states It
resembles the Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim
population high structural unemployment and low standard of living
The economys most prominent products are oil cotton and gas
Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for
several years but the negotiation of more than a dozen
productionsharing arrangements PSAs with foreign firms which have
thus far committed 30 billion to oil field development should
generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development Oil
production under the first of these PSAs with the Azerbaijan
International Operating Company began in November 1997 Azerbaijan
shares all the formidable problems of the exSoviet republics in
making the transition from a command to a market economy but its
considerable energy resources brighten its longterm prospects Baku
has only recently begun making progress on economic reform and old
economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced A major
shortterm obstacle to economic progress including stepped up foreign
investment is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the ethnic
Armeniandominated region of NagornoKarabakh Trade with Russia and
the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while
trade is building up with the nations of Europe Turkey Iran and the
UAE A serious longterm challenge is the maintenance of the
competitiveness of nonoil exports in world markets

Bahamas TheEconomy

Economyoverview The Bahamas is a stable developing nation with an
economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking Tourism
alone accounts for more than 50 of GDP and directly or indirectly
employs 40 of the archipelagos labor force Moderate growth in
tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels resorts
and residences led to an increase of the countrys GDP by an estimated
35 in 1997 Manufacturing and agriculture together contribute less
than 10 of GDP and show little growth despite government incentives
aimed at those sectors Overall growth prospects in the short run will
depend heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector and continued
income growth in the US which accounts for the majority of tourist
visitors

BahrainEconomy

Economyoverview In Bahrain petroleum production and processing
account for about 60 of export receipts 60 of government revenues
and 30 of GDP Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing
fortunes of oil since 1985 for example during and following the Gulf
crisis of 199091 With its highly developed communication and
transport facilities Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms
with business in the Gulf A large share of exports consists of
petroleum products made from imported crude Construction proceeds on
several major industrial projects Unemployment especially among the
young and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources
are major longterm economic problems

BangladeshEconomy

Economyoverview Despite sustained domestic and international efforts
to improve economic and demographic prospects Bangladesh remains one
of the worlds poorest most densely populated and least developed
nations Annual GDP growth has averaged over 4 in recent years from a
low base Its economy is largely agricultural with the cultivation of
rice the single most important activity in the economy Major
impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods the
inefficiency of stateowned enterprises a rapidly growing labor force
that cannot be absorbed by agriculture delays in exploiting energy
resources natural gas inadequate power supplies and slow
implementation of economic reforms Frequent strikes that crippled the
economy in 1995 and early 1996 subsided after Prime Minister Sheikh
HASINA Wajeds Awami League government assumed power in mid1996
allowing a return to normal economic activity The current government
has made some headway improving the climate for foreign investors and
liberalizing the capital markets for example it has negotiated with
foreign firms for oil and gas exploration better countrywide
distribution of cooking gas and the construction of natural gas
pipelines and power plants Progress on other economic reforms has
been halting because of opposition from the bureaucracy public sector
unions and other vested interest groups

BelarusEconomy

Economyoverview The Belarusian government has revived economic
output since mid1996 by pursuing a policy of rapid credit expansion
ending years of cumulative decline Real GDP increased by 26 in 1996
and the growth rate tripled in 1997 Lack of profitability and
resurgent inflationwhich increased from an average monthly rate of
28 in 1996 to 44 in 1997however have kept enterprises from
making much needed capital investments As a result infrastructure
and equipment stocks have continued to deteriorate Belarus has seen
little structural reform since 1995 when LUKASHENKO launched the
country on the path of market socialism Privatization of
enterprises controlled by the central government virtually ceased in
1996 As of May 1997 only about 10 of all enterprises under central
government control had been privatized In addition LUKASHENKO has
reimposed administrative control over prices and the national
currencys exchange rate and expanded the states right to intervene
arbitrarily in the management of private enterprise Lack of
structural reform and a climate hostile to business have inhibited
foreign investment in Belarus in 199597 In 1995 Belarus ranked
second to last among the 15 former Soviet republics in terms of the
average amount of foreign investment it attracted per capita Although
it moved up to 11th place in 1996 this was largely due to inflows
from Russia related to the construction of the Yamal natural gas
pipeline Belaruss trade deficit has grown steadily over the past
three years  from 8 of total trade turnover in 1995 to 14 in the
first quarter of 1997  despite the governments efforts to promote
exports and limit imports Given Belaruss limited fiscal reserve a
continued growth in the trade deficit will increase vulnerability to a
balance of payments crisis

Economyoverview This highly developed private enterprise economy has
capitalized on its central geographic location highly developed
transport network and diversified industrial and commercial base
Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the
north although the government is encouraging reinvestment in the
southern region of Walloon With few natural resources Belgium must
import substantial quantities of raw materials and export a large
volume of manufactures making its economy unusually dependent on the
state of world markets Twothirds of its trade is with other EU
countries The economy grew at a strong 4 annual pace during the
period 198890 slowed to 1 in 199192 dropped by 15 in 1993
recovered with moderate 23 growth in 1994 and 1995 and fell off
again to 14 in 1996 with continued substantial unemployment
Belgiums public debt fell from 127 of GDP in 1996 to 124 in 1997
and the government is trying to control its expenditures to bring the
figure more into line with other industrialized countries GDP growth

BelizeEconomy

Economyoverview The small essentially private enterprise economy is
based primarily on agriculture agrobased industry and
merchandising with tourism and construction assuming greater
importance Sugar the chief crop accounts for more than onethird of
exports while the banana industry is the countrys largest employer
The governments tough austerity program in 1997 resulted in an
economic slowdown that is likely to continue in 1998 Political
tension in the runup to the elections will tend to discourage
investment already suffering as a result of tight monetary and fiscal
policies The trade deficit has been growing mostly as a result of
low export prices for sugar and bananas and could increase further if
a preelection boost in government spending leads to a rise in
imports The ruling in 1997 by the World Trade Organization against
the European Unions banana import regimewhich had granted Belize
preferential treatment  is also hurting the prospects for growth and
could contribute to an increase in already high unemployment

BeninEconomy

Economyoverview The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and
dependent on subsistence agriculture cotton production and regional
trade Growth in real output which had averaged a sound 4 during
199095 rose to 55 in 1996 and was targeted at 48 for 1997 Rapid
population growth offset much of this growth in output Inflation
jumped to 55 in 1994 compared to 3 in 1993 following the 50
currency devaluation in January 1994 but has subsided over the past
three years with a target of 35 inflation in 1997 Commercial and
transport activities which make up a large part of GDP are extremely
vulnerable to developments in Nigeria particularly fuel shortages
Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral creditors has eased
the external debt situation in recent years The government still
burdened with moneylosing state enterprises and a bloated civil
service has been gradually implementing a World Bank supported
structural adjustment program since 1991

BermudaEconomy

Economyoverview Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes
in the world having successfully exploited its location by providing
financial services for international firms and luxury tourist
facilities for 360000 visitors annually The tourist industry which
accounts for an estimated 28 of GDP attracts 84 of its business
from North America The industrial sector is small and agriculture is
severely limited by a lack of suitable land About 80 of food needs
are imported International business contributes over 60 of Bermudas
economic output a failed independence vote in late 1995 can be
partially attributed to Bermudian fears of scaring away foreign firms

BhutanEconomy

Economyoverview The economy one of the worlds smallest and least
developed is based on agriculture and forestry which provide the
main livelihood for 90 of the population and account for about 40 of
GDP Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal
husbandry Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building
of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive The economy
is closely aligned with Indias through strong trade and monetary
links The industrial sector is technologically backward with most
production of the cottage industry type Most development projects
such as road construction rely on Indian migrant labor Bhutans
hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are key
resources The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in
expanding the nations productive base and improving social welfare
Model education social and environment programs in Bhutan are
underway with support from multilateral development organizations
Each economic program takes into account the governments desire to
protect the countrys environment and cultural traditions GDP growth
averaged 5 per year in 199195 with information not yet available
for 199697 Detailed controls and uncertain policies in areas like
industrial licensing trade labor and finance continue to hamper

BoliviaEconomy

Economyoverview With its long history of semifeudal social controls
dependence on volatile prices for its mineral exports and bouts of
hyperinflation Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least
developed Latin American countries However Bolivia has experienced
generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro
administration 198589 introduced marketoriented policies which
reduced inflation from 11700 in 1985 to about 20 in 1988 PAZ
Estenssoro was followed as president by Jaime PAZ Zamora 198993 who
continued the freemarket policies of his predecessor despite
opposition from his own party and from Bolivias once powerful labor
movement By maintaining fiscal discipline PAZ Zamora helped reduce
inflation to 93 in 1993 while GDP grew by an annual average of
325 during his tenure President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA 19931997 vowed
to advance the marketoriented economic reforms he helped launch as
PAZ Estenssoros planning minister His successes included the signing
of a free trade agreement with Mexico and the Southern Cone Common
Market Mercosur as well as the privatization of the state airline
phone company railroad electric power company and oil company
Furthermore SANCHEZ DE LOZADA sponsored legislation creating private
social security accounts for all adult Bolivians and capitalized these
new accounts with the states remaining 50 share in the privatized
companies Hugo BANZER Suarez took office in August 1997 and has
proclaimed his commitment to the economic reforms of the previous
administration

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

Introduction

Current issues On 21 November 1995 in Dayton Ohio the former
Yugoslavias three warring parties signed a peace agreement that
brought to a halt over three years of interethnic civil strife in
Bosnia and Herzegovina the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14
December 1995 The Dayton Agreement signed then by Bosnian President
IZETBEGOVIC Croatian President TUDJMAN and Serbian President
MILOSEVIC divides Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally between the
MuslimCroat Federation and the Bosnian Serbs while maintaining
Bosnias currently recognized borders In 199596 a NATOled
international peacekeeping force IFOR of 60000 troops served in
Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement
IFOR was succeeded by a smaller NATOled Stabilization Force SFOR
whose mission is to deter renewed hostilities SFOR will remain in
place until June 1998 A High Representative appointed by the UN
Security Council is responsible for civilian implementation of the
accord including monitoring implementation facilitating any
difficulties arising in connection with civilian implementation and
coordinating activities of the civilian organizations and agencies in
Bosnia and Herzegovina The Bosnian conflict began in the spring of
1992 when the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum
on independence and the Bosnian Serbs  supported by neighboring
Serbiaresponded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the
republic along ethnic lines and joining Serbheld areas to form a
greater Serbia In March 1994 Bosnias Muslims and Croats reduced
the number of warring factions from three to two by signing an
agreement in Washington creating their joint MuslimCroat Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina The Federation formed by the Muslims and
Croats in March 1994 is one of two entities the other being the
Bosnian Serbled Republika Srpska that comprise Bosnia and
Herzegovina

Governmentnote Until declaring independence in spring 1992 Bosnia
and Herzegovina existed as a republic in the former Yugoslavia Bosnia
was partitioned by fighting during 199295 and governed by competing
ethnic factions Bosnias current governing structures were created by
the Dayton Accords the 1995 peace agreement which was officially
signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 by Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC
Croatian President TUDJMAN and Serbian President MILOSEVIC This
agreement retained Bosnias exterior border and created a joint
multiethnic and democratic government This national governmentbased
on proportional representation similar to that which existed in the
former socialist regimeis charged with conducting foreign economic
and fiscal policy The Dayton Accords also recognized a second tier of
government comprised of two entitiesa joint MuslimCroat Federation
and the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska RSeach presiding over roughly
onehalf the territory The Federation and RS governments are charged
with overseeing internal functions As mandated by the Dayton Accords
the Bosnians on 14 September 1996 participated in the first postwar
elections of national entity and cantonal leaders The Bosnians have
been slow to form and install new joint institutions A new Federation
cabinet was sworn in 18 December 1996 and the new Bosnian central
government cabinet was confirmed on 3 January 1997 The Bosnians on
1314 September 1997 participated in municipal elections postponed in
1996 because of voter registration irregularities

Bosnia and HerzegovinaEconomy

Economyoverview Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old
Yugoslav federation Although agriculture has been almost all in
private hands farms have been small and inefficient and the republic
traditionally has been a net importer of food Industry has been
greatly overstaffed one reflection of the rigidities of communist
central planning and management TITO had pushed the development of
military industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted
a large share of Yugoslavias defense plants The bitter interethnic
warfare in Bosnia caused production to plummet by 80 from 1990 to
1995 unemployment to soar and human misery to multiply With an
uneasy peace in place output has recovered in 199697 at high
percentage rates on a low base but remains less than half the 1990
level The country especially in the MuslimCroat area receives
substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international
community Wide regional differences in war damage and access to the
outside world have resulted in substantial variations in living
conditions among local areas and individual families

BotswanaEconomy

Economyoverview Agriculture still provides a livelihood for more
than 80 of the population but supplies only about 50 of food needs
and accounts for only 4 of GDP Subsistence farming and cattle
raising predominate Diamond mining and tourism also are important to
the economy The sector is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils
Substantial mineral deposits were found in the 1970s and the mining
sector grew from 25 of GDP in 1980 to 35 in 1997 Unemployment
officially is 21 but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40 On
the plus side is the substantial positive trade balance

BrazilEconomy

Economyoverview Possessing large and welldeveloped agricultural
mining manufacturing and service sectors Brazils economy outweighs
that of all other South American countries and is expanding its
presence in world markets Prior to the institution of a stabilization
planthe Plano Real Real Plan in mid1994 stratospheric inflation
rates had disrupted economic activity and discouraged foreign
investment Since then tight monetary policy has brought inflation
under controlconsumer prices increased by less than 5 in 1997
compared to more than 1000 in 1994 At the same time GDP growth
slowed from 57 in 1994 to about 30 in 1997 due to tighter credit
The strong currency another cornerstone of the Real Plan has
encouraged importscontributing to a growing trade deficitand
restrained export growth Brazils more stable economy allowed it to
weather the fallout in 1995 from the Mexican peso crisis relatively
well Record levels of foreign investment have flowed in helping
support the Real Plan through financial shocks in OctoberNovember
1997 that occurred in the wake of the Asian financial crisis These
shocks caused Brazils foreign exchange reserves to drop by 8 billion
to 52 billion and the stock market to decline by about 25 although
it still ended up more than 30 for the year President CARDOSO
remains committed to defending the Real Plan but he faces several key
challenges domestically and abroad His package of fiscal reforms
requiring constitutional amendments has progressed slowly through the
balkanized Brazilian legislature in their absence the government
continues to run deficits and has limited room to relax its interest
and exchange rate policies if it wants to keep inflation under
control Some foreign investors remain concerned about the viability
of Brazils exchange rate policy because of the countrys fiscal and
current account deficits The government thus has to contend with the
possibility of capital flight or a speculative attack that could draw
down foreign reserves to a critical level and force a devaluation

British Virgin IslandsEconomy

Economyoverview The economy one of the most prosperous in the
Caribbean is highly dependent on tourism which generates an
estimated 45 of the national income In 1985 the government began
offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in
the islands and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues
An estimated 210000 companies were on the offshore registry by
yearend 1996 The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late
1994 which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated
statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses is expected
to make the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to
international business Livestock raising is the most important
agricultural activity poor soils limit the islands ability to meet
domestic food requirements Because of traditional close links with
the US Virgin Islands the British Virgin Islands has used the dollar
as their currency since 1959

sector accounting for perhaps half of GDP Per capita GDP is far above
most other Third World countries and substantial income from overseas
investment supplements income from domestic production The government
provides for all medical services and subsidizes food and housing The
government is beginning to show progress on its basic policy of
diversifying the economy away from oil and gas Bruneis leaders are
concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy
will undermine internal social cohesion

BulgariaEconomy

Economyoverview One of the poorest countries of central Europe
Bulgaria has slowly been moving from its old command economy towards a
marketoriented economy The economy faced a major crisis in 1996
marked by a banking system in turmoil a depreciating currency and
contracting production and foreign trade Foreign exchange reserves
dwindled to 518 million while dramatically hiked interest rates
added to the domestic debt burden and stifled growth GDP fell by 11
in 1996 after experiencing 20 growth in 1995 Privatization of
stateowned industries stagnated although the first auction of a mass
privatization program was undertaken in late 1996 Lagging progress on
structural reforms led to postponement of IMF disbursements under a
580 million standby loan agreed to in July 1996 In November 1996
the IMF proposed a currency board as Bulgarias best chance to restore
confidence in the lev eliminate unnecessary spending and avoid
hyperinflation The board was set up on 1 July 1997 Its establishment
was followed by a reduction in inflation and interest rates and by a
rise in foreign investment Simultaneously the government pledged to
sell off some of the most attractive state assets GDP in 1997 dropped
74 but is expected to rebound to an estimated 2 in 1998 Other
government objectives include the completion of land reform the
privatization and strengthening of the banking system and the
modernization of the legal environment of business

BurmaEconomy

Economyoverview Burma has a mixed economy with private activity
dominant in agriculture light industry and transport and with
substantial statecontrolled activity mainly in energy heavy
industry and the rice trade Government policy in the last nine
years 198997 has aimed at revitalizing the economy after three
decades of tight central planning Thus private activity has markedly
increased foreign investment has been encouraged so far with
moderate success and efforts continue to increase the efficiency of
state enterprises Published estimates of Burmas foreign trade are
greatly understated because of the volume of blackmarket trade A
major ongoing problem is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal
stability Although Burma remains a poor Asian country its rich
resources furnish the potential for substantial longterm increases in
income exports and living standards

Introduction

Current issues in a number of waves since October 1993 hundreds of
thousands of refugees have fled the ethnic violence between the Hutu
and Tutsi factions in Burundi and crossed into Rwanda Tanzania and
Zaire now called Democratic Republic of the Congo since October
1996 an estimated 92000 Hutu refuguees have been forced to return to
Burundi by Tutsi rebel forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
leaving an estimated 35000 still dispersed there in Burundi the
ethnic violence between the Hutus and the Tutsis continued in 1996
causing an additional 150000 Hutus to flee to Tanzania thus raising
their numbers in that country to about 250000

BurundiEconomy

Economyoverview Burundi is a landlocked resourcepoor country in an
early stage of economic development The economy is predominately
agricultural with roughly 90 of the population dependent on
subsistence agriculture Its economic health depends on the coffee
crop which accounts for 80 of foreign exchange earnings The ability
to pay for imports therefore rests largely on the vagaries of the
climate and the international coffee market As part of its economic
reform agenda launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank
support Burundi is trying to diversify its agricultural exports
attract foreign investment in industry and modernize government
budgetary practices Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from
massive ethnicbased violence which has resulted in the death of
perhaps 100000 persons and the displacement of a million others
Foods medicines and electricity remain in short supply An
impoverished and disorganized government can hardly implement the
needed reform programs

CambodiaEconomy

Economyoverview After four years of solid macroeconomic performance
Cambodias economy slowed dramatically in 1997 due to the twin shocks
of the regional economic crisis and the July violence and political
infighting Economic growth fell from 65 in 1996 to 15 in 1997
foreign investment slowed and tourism declined 16 from 1996 levels
Despite these difficulties inflation accelerated only slightly to
95 the government managed to keep the national budget in balance
even with increased expenditures on the military and police and the
economy ran a small balance of payments surplus The future payments
could be adversely affected by the currency crises in Thailand
Malaysia and Indonesia which tends to make Cambodias exports more
expensive at the same time imports from these countries become
cheaper The longterm development of the economy after decades of war
remains a daunting challenge Human resource levels in the population
are low particularly in the povertyridden countryside The almost
total lack of basic infrastructure in the countryside will continue to
hinder development Recurring political instability hinders foreign
investment Corruption and inexperience among Cambodias government
officials will serve as a further drag on the economy

CameroonEconomy

Economyoverview Because of its oil resources and favorable
agricultural conditions Cameroon has one of the bestendowed primary
commodity economies in subSaharan Africa Still it faces many of the
serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries such as a
topheavy civil service and a generally unfavorable climate for
business enterprise The development of the oil sector led to rapid
economic growth between 1970 and 1985 Growth came to an abrupt halt
in 1986 precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major
exports petroleum coffee and cocoa Export earnings were cut by
almost onethird and inefficiencies in fiscal management were
exposed Since 1990 the government has embarked on various IMF and
World Bank programs designed to spur business investment increase
efficiency in agriculture improve trade and recapitalize the
nations banks The government however failed to press forward
vigorously with these programs The latest enhanced structural
adjustment agreement was signed in October 1997 the parties hope this
will prove more successful yet government mismanagement remains a
problem Inflation which rose to 48 after the devaluation of 1994
has been brought back under control Progress toward privatization of
remaining state industry remains slow President BIYAs new government
of December 1997 has replaced old hands in the government economic
control structure with promising technocrats

CanadaEconomy

Economyoverview As an affluent hightech industrial society Canada
today closely resembles the US in its marketoriented economic system
pattern of production and high living standards Since World War II
the impressive growth of the manufacturing mining and service
sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into
one primarily industrial and urban Canada started the 1990s in
recession and real rates of growth have averaged only 11 so far
this decade Because of slower growth Canada still faces high
unemploymentespecially in Quebec and the Maritime Provincesand a
large public sector debt With its great natural resources skilled
labor force and modern capital plant however Canada will enjoy
better economic prospects in the future The continuing constitutional
impasse between English and Frenchspeaking areas is raising the
possibility of a split in the federation making foreign investors
somewhat edgy

Cape VerdeEconomy

Economyoverview Cape Verdes low per capita GDP reflects a poor
natural resource base serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles
of longterm drought and a high birth rate The economy is
serviceoriented with commerce transport and public services
accounting for almost 70 of GDP Although nearly 70 of the
population lives in rural areas the share of agriculture in GDP in
1995 was only 8 of which fishing accounts for 15 About 90 of
food must be imported The fishing potential mostly lobster and tuna
is not fully exploited Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit
financed by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants remittances
constitute a supplement to GDP of more than 20 Economic reforms
launched by the new democratic government in 1991 are aimed at
developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to
diversify the economy Prospects for 1998 depend heavily on the
maintenance of aid flows remittances and the momentum of the
governments development program

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

Introduction

Current issues In 1996 the Central African Republic experienced
three mutinies by dissident elements of the armed forces which
demanded back pay as well as political and military reforms
Continuing violence in 1997 between the government and rebel military
groups over pay issues living conditions and lack of opposition
party representation in the government has destroyed many businesses
in the capital reducing tax revenues and exacerbating the
governments problems in meeting expenses

Central African RepublicEconomy

Economyoverview Subsistence agriculture together with forestry
remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic
CAR with more than 70 of the population living in outlying areas
The agricultural sector generates half of GDP Timber has accounted
for about 16 of export earnings and the diamond industry for nearly
54 Important constraints to economic development include the CARs
landlocked position a poor transportation system a largely unskilled
work force and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies The
50 devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on
12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CARs economy Diamond
timber coffee and cotton exports increased leading an estimated
rise of GDP of 7 in 1994 and nearly 5 in 1995 Military rebellions
and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction
of property and a drop in GDP of 1 Ongoing violence between the
government and rebel military groups over pay issues living
conditions and political representation has destroyed many businesses
in the capital reduced tax revenues for the government and delayed
negotiations for an IMF financial aid agreement

ChinaEconomy

Economyoverview Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has
been trying to move the economy from a sluggish Sovietstyle centrally
planned economy to a more marketoriented economy but still within a
rigid political framework of Communist Party control To this end the
authorities switched to a system of household responsibility in
agriculture in place of the old collectivization increased the
authority of local officials and plant managers in industry permitted
a wide variety of smallscale enterprise in services and light
manufacturing and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and
investment The result has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978
Agricultural output doubled in the 1980s and industry also posted
major gains especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and opposite
Taiwan where foreign investment helped spur output of both domestic
and export goods On the darker side the leadership has often
experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism
bureaucracy lassitude corruption and of capitalism windfall gains
and steppedup inflation Beijing thus has periodically backtracked
retightening central controls at intervals In 199297 annual growth
of GDP accelerated particularly in the coastal areasaveraging about
10 annually according to official figures In late 1993 Chinas
leadership approved additional longterm reforms aimed at giving still
more play to marketoriented institutions and at strengthening the
centers control over the financial system state enterprises would
continue to dominate many key industries in what was now termed a
socialist market economy In 199597 inflation dropped sharply
reflecting tighter monetary policies and stronger measures to control
food prices At the same time the government struggled to a collect
revenues due from provinces businesses and individuals b reduce
corruption and other economic crimes and c keep afloat the large
stateowned enterprises most of which had not participated in the
vigorous expansion of the economy and many of which have been losing
the ability to pay full wages and pensions From 60 to 100 million
surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities
many subsisting through parttime lowpaying jobs Popular resistance
changes in central policy and loss of authority by rural cadres have
weakened Chinas population control program which is essential to
maintaining growth in living standards Another longterm threat to
continued rapid economic growth is the deterioration in the
environment notably air pollution soil erosion and the steady fall
of the water table especially in the north China continues to lose
arable land because of erosion and economic development furthermore
the regime gives insufficient priority to agricultural research The
next few years may witness increasing tensions between a highly
centralized political system and an increasingly decentralized
economic system Rapid economic growth likely will continue but at a
declining rate Hong Kongs reversion on 1 July 1997 to Chinese
administration will strengthen the already close ties between the two
economies

ColombiaEconomy

Economyoverview Columbia is recovering from a short recession that
began in late 1996  resulting from tight monetary policy to drive
down inflation declining business confidence related to President
SAMPERs political difficulties and a slowdown in exports stemming
from an appreciation of the peso and a recession in neighboring
Venezuela Although 1997s 31 GDP growth rate represented an
improvement over 1996 it ranked among the lowest in Latin America and
was substantially lower than the average annual growth rate exceeding
4 that Colombia posted for several decades prior to SAMPERs
election Colombias next president will inherit a variety of economic
problems Most notably the unemployment rate is at its highest level
this decade risks for the export sector and foreign investors are
rising as a result of increasing guerrilla violence and a volatile
exchange rate and the fiscal deficit has more than tripled since
1994

COMOROS

Introduction

Historical perspective Comoros has had difficulty in achieving
political stability having endured 18 coups or attempted coups since
receiving independence from France in 1975 Most recently in August
1997 the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared their independence
from Comoros An attempt in September 1997 by the government to
reestablish control over the rebellious islands by force failed and
presently the Organization of African Unity is brokering negotiations
to effect a reconciliation

ComorosEconomy

Economyoverview One of the worlds poorest countries Comoros is
made up of three islands that have inadequate transportation links a
young and rapidly increasing population and few natural resources
The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a
subsistence level of economic activity high unemployment and a heavy
dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance Agriculture
including fishing hunting and forestry is the leading sector of the
economy It contributes 40 to GDP employs 80 of the labor force
and provides most of the exports The country is not selfsufficient
in food production rice the main staple accounts for the bulk of
imports The government is struggling to upgrade education and
technical training to privatize commercial and industrial
enterprises to improve health services to diversify exports to
promote tourism and to reduce the high population growth rate
Continued foreign support is essential if the goal of 4 annual GDP
growth is to be maintained in the late 1990s

Congo Democratic Republic of theEconomy

Economyoverview The economy of Democratic Republic of the Congoa
nation endowed with vast potential wealthhas declined significantly
since the mid1980s The new government has instituted a tight fiscal
policy that has curbed inflation and currency depreciation Plans are
underway to introduce a new national currency Most formal
transactions are conducted in hard currency but a barter economy
flourishes in all but the largest cities Most individuals and
families survive through subsistence farming or petty trade
International investors show renewed interest especially in the
mining and telecommunications sectors However poor infrastructure
an uncertain legal framework corruption and lack of transparency in
government economic policy remain a brake on investment and growth A
number of IMF and World Bank missions have met with the new government
to help it develop a coherent economic plan

Congo Republic of theEconomy

Economyoverview The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and
handicrafts an industrial sector based largely on oil support
services and a government characterized by budget problems and
overstaffing Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
economy providing about 90 of government revenues and exports In
the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to
finance largescale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5
annually one of the highest rates in Africa Subsequently falling
oil prices cut GDP growth by half Moreover the government has
mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings contributing to
the governments shortage of revenues The 12 January 1994 devaluation
of Franc Zone currencies by 50 resulted in inflation of 61 in 1994
but inflation has subsided since Economic reform efforts continue
with the support of international organizations notably the World
Bank and the IMF

Cook IslandsEconomy

Economyoverview Like many other South Pacific island nations the
Cook Islands economic development is hindered by the isolation of the
country from foreign markets lack of natural resources periodic
devastation from natural disasters and inadequate infrastructure
Agriculture provides the economic base with major exports made up of
copra and citrus fruit Manufacturing activities are limited to
fruitprocessing clothing and handicrafts Trade deficits are made
up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid
overwhelmingly from New Zealand In 1996 the government declared
bankruptcy citing a 120 million public debt Efforts to exploit
tourism potential and expanding the mining and fishing industries have
not been enough to adequately deal with the financial crisis In an
effort to stem further erosion of the economy the government slashed
public service salaries by 50 condensed the number of government
ministries from 52 to 22 reduced the number of civil servants by more
than half began selling government assets and closed all overseas
diplomatic posts except for the one in New Zealand

Costa RicaEconomy

Economyoverview Costa Ricas basically stable and progressive
economy depends especially on tourism and the export of bananas
coffee and other agricultural products Poverty has been
substantially reduced over the past 15 years and a strong social
safety net has been put in place Recent trends however have been
disappointing Economic growth slipped from 43 in 1994 to 25 in
1995 and to 09 in 1996 and then rebounded in 1997 to 3 Inflation
rose to 225 in 1995 from 135 in 1994 receded to 175 in 1996
then dropped to 112 in 1997 Unemployment appears moderate at 57
but substantial underemployment continues Furthermore substantial
government deficits have undermined efforts to maintain the quality of
social services The government thus faces a formidable set of
problems to curb inflation reduce the deficit encourage domestic
savings and improve public sector efficiency while increasing the
role of the private sector all this in harmony with IMF agreements
One important positive developmentthe infusion of more than 200
million in 1997 by microchip giant Intel and the anticipated
attraction of other hightech firms to Costa Rica will help stimulate
growth and employment over the next several years

Cote dIvoireEconomy

Economyoverview Cote dIvoire is among the worlds largest producers
and exporters of coffee cocoa beans and palm oil Consequently the
economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices
for these products and to weather conditions Despite attempts by the
government to diversify the economy it is still largely dependent on
agriculture and related activities which engage roughly 85 of the
population After several years of lagging performance the Ivorian
economy began a comeback in 1994 due to improved prices for cocoa and
coffee growth in nontraditional primary exports such as pineapples
and rubber limited trade and banking liberalization offshore oil and
gas discoveries and generous external financing and debt rescheduling
by multilateral lenders and France The 50 devaluation of Franc Zone
currencies on 12 January 1994 caused a onetime jump in the inflation
rate to 26 in 1994 but the rate fell to 7 in 1996 and an estimated
34 in 1997 Moreover government adherence to donormandated reforms
led to a jump in growth rates65 in GDP in 1996 and again in 1997

CroatiaEconomy

Economyoverview Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia the Republic
of Croatia after Slovenia was the most prosperous and industrialized
area with a per capita output perhaps onethird above the Yugoslav
average Croatia faces considerable economic problems stemming from
the legacy of longtime communist mismanagement of the economy damage
during the internecine fighting to bridges factories power lines
buildings and houses the large refugee and displaced population
both Croatian and Bosnian and the disruption of economic ties
Western aid and investment especially in the tourist and oil
industries would help restore the economy The government has been
successful in some reform effortspartially macroeconomic
stabilization policiesand it has normalized relations with its
creditors Yet it still is struggling with privatization of large
state enterprises and with bank reform

CubaEconomy

Economyoverview The state plays the primary role in the economy and
controls practically all foreign trade The government has undertaken
several reforms in recent years to stem excess liquidity increase
labor incentives and alleviate serious shortages of food consumer
goods and services The liberalized agricultural markets introduced
in October 1994 at which state and private farmers sell abovequota
production at unrestricted prices have broadened legal consumption
alternatives and reduced black market prices Government efforts to
lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money
supply caused the semiofficial exchange rate for the Cuban peso to
move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 23 to
the dollar by yearend 1997 New taxes introduced in 1996 helped drive
down the number of selfemployed workers from 208000 in January 1996
to 176000 by September 1997 Havana announced in 1995 that GDP
declined by 35 during 198993 the result of lost Soviet aid and
domestic inefficiencies The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994
when Cuba reported 07 growth followed by increases of 25 in 1995
and 78 in 1996 Growth slowed again in 1997 to 25 in part due to
a poor sugar harvest Export earnings declined 3 in 1997 to 19
billion the result of lower sugar export volume and lower world
prices for nickel and sugar Imports remained unchanged in 1997 at
32 billion Tourism plays a key role in foreign currency earnings
The disparity between those at the top of the ladder and those at the
bottom has increased markedly in the past 10 years Living standards
for the average Cuban remain at a depressed level compared with 1990

CyprusEconomy

Economyoverview The Greek Cypriot economy is small and prosperous
but highly susceptible to external shocks Industry contributes 22 to
GDP and employs 25 of the labor force while the service sector
contributes 73 to GDP and employs 62 of the labor force Erratic
growth rates in the 1990s reflect the economys vulnerability to
swings in tourist arrivals caused by political instability on the
island and fluctuations in economic conditions in Western Europe The
Turkish Cypriot economy has about onethird the per capita GDP of the
south Because it is recognized only by Turkey it has had much
difficulty arranging foreign financing and foreign firms have
hesitated to invest there The economy remains heavily dependent on
agriculture and government service which together employ about half
of the work force Moreover the small vulnerable economy has
suffered because the Turkish lira is legal tender To compensate for
the economys weakness Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to
nearly every sector In January 1997 Turkey signed a 250 million
economic cooperation accord with the Turkish Cypriot area to support
tourism education and industry

Czech RepublicEconomy

Economyoverview Political and financial crises in 1997 shattered the
Czech Republics image as one of the most stable and prosperous of
postCommunist states Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure
to develop a wellfunctioning capital market played major roles in
Czech economic troubles which culminated in a currency crisis in May
The currency was forced out of its fluctuation band as investors
worried that the current account deficit which reached about 8 of
GDP in 1996 would become unsustainable After expending 3 billion in
vain to support the currency the central bank let it float The
growing current account imbalance reflected a surge in domestic demand
and poor export performance as wage increases outpaced productivity
The government was forced to introduce two austerity packages later in
the spring which cut government spending by 25 of GDP A tough 1998
budget continues the painful medicine These problems were compounded
in the summer of 1997 by unprecedented flooding which inundated much
of the eastern part of the country Czech difficulties in 1997
contrast with earlier achievements of strong GDP growth a balanced
budget and inflation and unemployment that were among the lowest in
the region The Czech economys transition problems continue to be too
much direct and indirect government influence on the privatized
economy the sometimes ineffective management of privatized firms and
a shortage of experienced financial analysts for the banking system

DjiboutiEconomy

Economyoverview The economy is based on service activities connected
with the countrys strategic location and status as a free trade zone
in northeast Africa Twothirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
city the remainder being mostly nomadic herders Scanty rainfall
limits crop production to fruits and vegetables and most food must be
imported Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the
region and an international transshipment and refueling center It has
few natural resources and little industry The nation is therefore
heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of
payments and to finance development projects An unemployment rate of
40 to 50 continues to be a major problem Per capita consumption
dropped an estimated 35 over the last seven years because of
recession civil war and a high population growth rate including
immigrants and refugees Faced with a multitude of economic
difficulties the government has fallen in arrears on longterm
external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of
foreign aid donors

DominicaEconomy

Economyoverview The economy is dependent on agriculture and thus is
highly vulnerable to climatic conditions notably tropical storms
Agriculture primarily bananas accounts for 26 of GDP and employs
40 of the labor force Development of the tourist industry remains
difficult because of the rugged coastline lack of beaches and the
lack of an international airport Hurricane Luis devastated the
countrys banana crop in September 1995 tropical storms had wiped out
onequarter of the crop in 1994 as well The government is attempting
to develop an offshore financial industry in order to diversify the
islands production base

Dominican RepublicEconomy

Economyoverview Economic reforms launched in late 1994 contributed
to exchange rate stabilization reduced inflation and strong GDP
growth in 199596 In 1996 there was increased mineral and petroleum
exploration and a new investment law that allows for repatriation of
capital dividends has drawn more investment to the island Upon coming
to power in August 1996 President FERNANDEZ nevertheless inherited a
troubleridden economy hampered by a pressured peso a large external
debt nearly bankrupt stateowned enterprises and a manufacturing
sector hindered by daily power outages In December FERNANDEZ
presented a bold economic reform packageincluding such reforms as the
devaluation of the peso income tax cuts a 50 increase in sales
taxes reduced import tariffs and increased gasoline pricesin an
attempt to create a marketoriented economy that can compete
internationally Even though reforms are moving ahead at a slow pace
the economy grew vigorously in 1997 with tourism and
telecommunications leading the advance The government is working to
increase electric generating capacity a key to continued economic
growth

EcuadorEconomy

Economyoverview Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
agricultural areas As an exporter of primary products such as oil
bananas and shrimp fluctuations in world market prices can have a
substantial domestic impact Growth has been uneven in recent years as
the government has repeatedly initiated illconceived fiscal
stabilization measures The populist government of Abdala BUCARAM
Ortiz proposed a major currency reform in 1996 but popular discontent
with new austerity measures and rampant official corruption undermined
his governments position Congress replaced BUCARAM with Fabian
ALARCON in February 1997 ALARCON has adopted a minimalist economic
program that puts off major decisions until the next elected
government takes office in August 1998 Ecuador joined the World Trade
Organization in 1996 but has failed to comply with many of its
accession commitments Growth slowed to 20 in 1996 due to a lack of
investment caused by political uncertainty and high domestic interest
rates but economic activity picked up in 1997 Exports and economic
growth in 1998 may be adversely affected by lower world oil prices
and to a smaller extent by El Nino

EgyptEconomy

Economyoverview At the end of the 1980s Egypt faced problems of low
productivity and poor economic management compounded by the adverse
social effects of excessive population growth high inflation and
massive urban overcrowding In the face of these pressures in 1991
Egypt undertook wideranging macroeconomic stabilization and
structural reform measures This reform effort has been supported by
three successive IMF arrangements the last of which was concluded in
October 1996 Egypts reform effortsand its participation in the Gulf
war coalitionalso led to massive debt relief under the Paris Club
arrangements Although the pace of reform has been uneven and slower
than envisaged under the IMF programs substantial progress has been
made in improving macroeconomic performance Budget deficits have been
slashed while foreign reserves in 1997 were at an alltime high And
Egypt has been moving toward a more decentralized marketoriented
economy These economic reforms and growing investment opportunities
have prompted increasing foreign investment but incoming capital has
largely been concentrated in stock market portfolio flows Egypts
economy also has been hit by a sharp downturn in tourisma key foreign
exchange and job producing sectorfollowing the 17 November 1997
massacre of foreign tourists at Luxor Although Egypt will probably
regain these revenues over time the slump in tourism is likely to
slow the GDP growth rate in 1998

El SalvadorEconomy

Economyoverview In 1997 the government emphasized a fixed exchange
rate along with conservative monetary and fiscal policies to promote
foreign investment Inflation fell to an unprecedented low of 2
Exports reached a record level and were the main engine of growth
Productivity in other sectors remained weaker however For the last
few years El Salvador has experienced sizable deficits in both its
trade and its fiscal accounts The trade deficit has been offset by
remittances from the large number of Salvadorans living abroad and
from external aid The deficit is expected to increase in 1998 as
imports continue to rise San Salvador is stepping up its
privatization efforts in 1998 to increase revenues Late in 1997 the
legislative assembly approved a privatization law that will facilitate
the sale of the stateowned telephone company sometime in 1998 The
government also plans to privatize pension funds later in the year

Disputesinternational land boundary dispute with Honduras mostly
resolved by 11 September 1992 International Court of Justice ICJ
decision the presidents of Honduras and El Salvador signed in January
1998 an agreement allowing citizens in the 1992 demarcated areas to
choose Honduran or Salvadoran citizenship the two countries also
agreed to a final demarcation of the border within one year the
agreement awaits ratification by the legislative assemblies of both
countries with respect to the maritime boundary in the Golfo de
Fonseca ICJ referred to an earlier agreement in this century and
advised that some tripartite resolution among El Salvador Honduras
and Nicaragua likely would be required

Equatorial GuineaEconomy

Economyoverview The discovery and exploitation of large oil reserves
have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years Farming
forestry and fishing are also major components of GDP Subsistence
farming predominates Although preindependence Equatorial Guinea
counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings the
deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has
diminished potential for agricultureled growth A number of aid
programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off
since 1993 because of the governments gross corruption and
mismanagement Businesses for the most part are owned by government
officials and their family members Undeveloped natural resources
include titanium iron ore manganese uranium and alluvial gold The
country responded favorably to the devaluation of the CFA franc in

EritreaEconomy

Economyoverview With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993
Eritrea faced the bitter economic problems of a small desperately
poor African country The economy is largely based on subsistence
agriculture with over 70 of the population involved in farming and
herding The small industrial sector consists mainly of light
industries with outmoded technologies Domestic output GDP is
substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad Government
revenues come from custom duties and taxes on income and sales Road
construction is a top domestic priority Eritrea has inherited the
entire coastline of Ethiopia and has longterm prospects for revenues
from the development of offshore oil fields offshore fishing and
tourism Eritreas economic future depends on its ability to master
fundamental social and economic problems eg overcoming illiteracy
promoting job creation expanding technical training attracting
foreign investment and streamlining the bureaucracy

EstoniaEconomy

Economyoverview In 1997 Estonias continued implementation of market
economic reforms disciplined fiscal and monetary policies and a
liberal free trade regime resulted in GDP growth of 10 and a drop in
inflation to 112 Estonia can point to its inclusion among the first
group of Central and East European countries to begin EU accession
talks in 1998 as its most significant economic achievement in 1997
Other economic strengths include solid investment grade rating from
both Standard and Poors and Moodys government revenue collection in
excess of projections by more than 6 growth in exports at a faster
rate than imports and record levels of foreign direct investment
among the highest per capita in Central and East Europe Estonia
privatized its shipping company in 1997 but failed to make as much
progress privatizing other large infrastructureutility companies
such as Eesti Energia and the Oil Shale company which it plans to
privatize in the next two years The growing current account deficit
which stood at nearly 10 of GDP at yearend 1997 remains a serious
concern In 1998 GDP is expected to grow by 55 and inflation to
fall 10

EthiopiaEconomy

Economyoverview Ethiopia remains one of the poorest and least
developed countries in the world Its economy is based on agriculture
which accounts for more than half of GDP 90 of exports and 80 of
total employment coffee generates 60 of export earnings The
agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought poor
cultivation practices and deterioration of internal security
conditions The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
from the agricultural sector Over 90 of largescale industry but
less than 10 of agriculture is staterun The government is
considering selling off a portion of stateowned plants and is
implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the
economy A major mediumterm problem is the improvement of roads
water supply and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected
during years of civil strife

Falkland Islands Islas MalvinasEconomy

Economyoverview The economy was formerly based on agriculture
mainly sheep farming which directly or indirectly employs most of the
work force Dairy farming supports domestic consumption crops furnish
winter fodder Exports feature shipments of highgrade wool to the UK
and the sale of postage stamps and coins Rich stocks of fish in the
surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders So
far efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been
unsuccessful The economy has diversified since 1987 when the
government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone overfishing is
a growing problem These license fees total more than 40 million per
year and support the islands health education and welfare system
To encourage tourism the Falkland Islands Development Corporation has
built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and
trout fishing The islands are now selffinancing except for defense
The British Geological Survey announced a 200mile oil exploration
zone around the islands in 1993 and early seismic surveys suggest
substantial reserves capable of producing 500000 barrels per day An
agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse
licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest
in exploiting potential oil reserves

Faroe IslandsEconomy

Economyoverview The Faroese economy in 1995 and 1996 saw a
noticeable upturn after several years of decline brought on by a drop
in fish catches and declining prices and by overspending by the
Faroese Home Rule Government FHRG In the early 1990s property
values plummeted and the FHRG had to bail out and merge the two
largest Faroese banks Fishing is now improving wage costs are
increasing the FHRGs budget is almost in balance and the large
foreign debt has come down significantly Nevertheless the total
dependence on fishing makes the Faroese economy extremely vulnerable
and the reduction in the foreign debt is at the cost of low
investment Oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for deposits
in the immediate Faroese area which may lay the basis for an eventual
economic rebound The Faroese are supported by a substantial annual
subsidy from Denmark

FijiEconomy

Economyoverview Fiji endowed with forest mineral and fish
resources is one of the most developed of the Pacific island
economies though still with a large subsistence sector Sugar exports
and a growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign
exchange Sugar processing makes up onethird of industrial activity
Roughly 250000 tourists visit each year Political uncertainty and
drought however contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings
from tourism and sugar and to the emigration of skilled workers
Fijis growth slowed in 1997 because the sugar industry suffered from
low world prices and rent disputes between farmers and landowners

FinlandEconomy

Economyoverview Finland has a highly industrialized largely
freemarket economy with per capita output roughly that of the UK
France Germany and Italy Its key economic sector is
manufacturingprincipally the wood metals and engineering
industries Trade is important with the export of goods representing
about 30 of GDP Except for timber and several minerals Finland
depends on imports of raw materials energy and some components for
manufactured goods Because of the climate agricultural development
is limited to maintaining selfsufficiency in basic products
Forestry an important export earner provides a secondary occupation
for the rural population The economy has come back from the recession
of 199092 which had been caused by economic overheating depressed
foreign markets and the dismantling of the barter system between
Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had
been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods The Finns voted in an
October 1994 referendum to enter the EU and Finland officially joined
the Union on 1 January 1995 Attempts to cut the unacceptably high
rate of unemployment and increasing integration with Western Europe
will dominate the economic picture over the next few years Despite
high unemployment and moderate GDP growth of 39 anticipated for
1998 inflation is forecast to rise to 25

FranceEconomy

Economyoverview One of the four West European trilliondollar
economies France matches a growing services sector with a diversified
industrial base and substantial agricultural resources Services now
account for more than 70 of GDP while industry generates about
onequarter of GDP and more than 80 of export earnings The
government retains considerable influence over key segments of each
sector with majority ownership of railway electricity aircraft and
telecommunication firms It nevertheless has been slowly relaxing its
control over these sectors since the early 1990s most recently
selling 23 of France Telecom The government also plans to sell its
stakes in Air France and in the insurance banking and defense
industries Meanwhile large tracts of fertile land the application
of modern technology and subsidies have combined to make France the
leading agricultural producer in Western Europe A major exporter of
wheat and dairy products France is virtually selfsufficient in
agriculture The economy expanded by 23 last year following a 13
gain in 1996 Persistently high unemployment still poses a major
problem for the government however as does the need to control
government spending to keep the economy internationally competitive
and meet membership qualifications for the European Economic and
Monetary Union EMU which is slated to introduce a common European
currency in January 1999 Succeeding governments have shied away from
cutting exceptionally generous social welfare benefits or the enormous
state bureaucracy preferring to pare defense spending and raise taxes
to keep the deficit down The JOSPIN administration has pledged both
to lower unemployment and bring France into EMU pinning its hopes for
new jobs on economic growth and on legislation to gradually reduce the
workweek from 39 to 35 hours by 2002

Economyoverview The economy is tied closely to that of France
through subsidies and imports Besides the French space center at
Kourou fishing and forestry are the most important economic
activities with exports of fish and fish products mostly shrimp
accounting for more than 60 of total revenue in 1992 The large
reserves of tropical hardwoods not fully exploited support an
expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export
Cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal area where the
population is largely concentrated French Guiana is heavily dependent
on imports of food and energy Unemployment is a serious problem

in the region French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence economy
to one in which a high proportion of the work force is either employed
by the military or supports the tourist industry Tourism accounts for
about 20 of GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings
The small manufacturing sector primarily processes agricultural
products The territory will continue to benefit from a fiveyear
199498 development agreement with France aimed principally at
creating new jobs

GabonEconomy

Economyoverview Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of
most nations of subSaharan Africa This has supported a sharp decline
in extreme poverty but because of high income inequality a large
proportion of the population remains poor Gabon depended on timber
and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s
The oil sector now accounts for 50 of GDP Gabon continues to face
fluctuating prices for its oil timber manganese and uranium
exports Despite the abundance of natural wealth and a manageable rate
of population growth the economy is hobbled by poor fiscal
management In 1992 the fiscal deficit widened to 24 of GDP and
Gabon failed to settle arrears on its bilateral debt leading to a
cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and private
creditors Devaluation of its Francophone currency by 50 on 12
January 1994 sparked a onetime inflationary surge to 35 the rate
dropped to 6 in 1996 The IMF provided a oneyear standby arrangement
in 199495 and a threeyear Enhanced Financing Facility EFF at near
commercial rates beginning in late 1995 Those agreements mandate
progress in privatization and fiscal discipline France provided
additional financial support in January 1997 after Gabon had met IMF
targets for mid1996 In 1997 an IMF mission to Gabon chastened the
government for overspending on offbudget items overborrowing from
the central bank and slipping on its schedule for privatization and
administrative reform such as reduced public sector employment and
salary growth

Gambia TheEconomy

Economyoverview The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural
resources and has a limited agricultural base About 75 of the
population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood
Smallscale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts
fish and hides Reexport trade normally constitutes a major segment
of economic activity but the 50 devaluation of the CFA franc in
January 1994 made Senegalese goods more competitive and hurt the
reexport trade The Gambia has benefited from a rebound in tourism
after its decline in response to the militarys takeover in July 1994
Shortrun economic progress remains highly dependent on sustained
bilateral and multilateral aid and on responsible government economic
management

Gaza StripEconomy

Economyoverview Economic progress in the Gaza Strip has been
hampered by tight Israeli security restrictions In 1991 roughly 40
of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by Israeli
industrial construction and agricultural enterprises with worker
remittances supplementing GDP by roughly 50 Gaza has depended upon
Israel for nearly 90 of its external trade The Persian Gulf crisis
and its aftershocks have dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990 Worker
remittances from the Gulf states have dropped unemployment and
popular unrest have increased and living standards have fallen The
redeployment of Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip in May 1994 has added
to the set of adjustment problems This series of disruptions has
meant a sharp decline in employment in Israel since 1991 and a drop in
GDP as a whole An estimated 378000 persons were in refugee camps in
1996

GEORGIA

Introduction

Current issues Beset by ethnic and civil strife since independence in
1991 Georgia began to stabilize in 1994 Separatist conflicts in
Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been dormant since spring 1994
although political settlements remain elusive Russian peacekeepers
are deployed in both regions and a UN Observer Mission is operating in
Abkhazia As a result of these conflicts Georgia still has about
250000 internally displaced people In 1995 Georgia adopted a new
constitution and conducted generally free and fair nationwide
presidential and parliamentary elections In 1996 the government
focused its attention to implementing an ambitious economic reform
program and professionalizing its parliament Violence and organized
crime were sharply curtailed in 1995 and 1996 but corruption remains
rife In 1997 SHEVARDNADZE succeeded in bringing international
attention to the Abkhazia conflict The UN sponsored two meetings on
the subject but a resolution is still far off Georgia also took some
steps in 1997 to reduce its dependence on Russia acquiring coastal
patrol boats it hopes to use to replace the current Russian border
units on the Black Sea coast The year 1997 also saw a sharpening of
rhetoricespecially from parliamentagainst Russias continued
military presence on Georgian territory

GeorgiaEconomy

Economyoverview Georgias economy has traditionally revolved around
Black Sea tourism cultivation of citrus fruits tea and grapes
mining of manganese and copper and output of a small industrial
sector producing wine metals machinery chemicals and textiles The
country imports the bulk of its energy needs including natural gas
and oil products Its only sizable internal energy resource is
hydropower Despite the severe damage the economy has suffered due to
civil strife Georgia with the help of the IMF and World Bank has
made substantial economic gains in 199597 increasing GDP growth and
slashing inflation Georgia still suffers from energy shortages
although energy deliveries are steadily improving Georgia is pinning
its hopes for longterm recovery on the development of an
international transportation corridor through the key Black Sea ports
of Poti and Batumi The construction of a Caspian oil pipeline
through Georgiascheduled to open in early 1999should spur greater
western investment in the economy A growing trade deficit continuing
problems with corruption and political uncertainties cloud the
shortterm economic picture

GermanyEconomy

Economyoverview In 1997 the German economy the worlds third most
powerful benefited from robust exports particularly to other members
of the EU and the US as well as strengthening equipment investment
But anemic private consumption and a contraction in the construction
industry limited the expansion Unemployment continued to set postwar
monthly records through the end of 1997 and averaged 43 million for
the year In preparation for the 1 January 1999 start of the European
Monetary Union the government has made major efforts in 199697 to
reduce the fiscal deficit This effort has been complicated by growing
unemployment an erosion of the tax base and the continuing transfer
of roughly 100 billion a year to eastern Germany to refurbish this
excommunist area In recent years business and political leaders have
become increasingly concerned about Germanys decline in
attractiveness as an investment target They cite increasing
preference by German companies to locate new manufacturing facilities
in foreign countries including the US rather than in Germany to be
closer to the markets and to avoid Germanys high tax rates high wage
costs rigid labor structures and extensive regulations For similar
reasons foreign investment in Germany has been lagging in recent
years

GhanaEconomy

Economyoverview Well endowed with natural resources Ghana has twice
the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa Even so
Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial and
technical assistance Gold timber and cocoa production are major
sources of foreign exchange The domestic economy continues to revolve
around subsistence agriculture which accounts for 41 of GDP and
employs 60 of the work force mainly small landholders In 199597
Ghana made mixed progress under a threeyear structural adjustment
program in cooperation with the IMF On the minus side public sector
wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments have led to
continued inflationary deficit financing depreciation of the cedi
and rising public discontent with Ghanas austerity measures

GreenlandEconomy

Economyoverview Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the
early 1990s but since 1993 the economy has improved The Greenland
Home Rule Government GHRG has pursued a light fiscal policy since
the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the public budget
and low inflation Since 1990 Greenland has registered a foreign
trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and
zinc mine in 1989 Greenland today is critically dependent on fishing
and fish exports the shrimp fishery is by far the largest income
earner Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and
minerals exploration activities it will take several years before
production can materialize Tourism is the only sector offering any
nearterm potential and even this is limited due to a short season and
high costs The public sector including publicly owned enterprises
and the municipalities plays the dominant role in Greenlands
economy About half the government revenues come from grants from the
Danish Government an important supplement of GDP

GrenadaEconomy

Economyoverview The agriculturally based economy was hurt in 1996 by
the emergence of the pink mealy bug which destroyed much of the cocoa
harvest Bananas a major foreign exchange earner also suffered due
to falling prices low production and poor quality Tourism the
leading foreign exchange earner continued to do well as did
manufacturing Construction boomed in 1996 due to concessions for low
and middle income mortgages The government introduced a 5 tax on
electricity and telephones and doubled the general consumption tax
which caused a small rise in the inflation rate The tourist industry
faces stiff competition over the next few years

GuatemalaEconomy

Economyoverview The agricultural sector accounts for onefourth of
GDP and twothirds of exports and employs more than half of the labor
force Coffee sugar and bananas are the main products Manufacturing
and construction account for onefifth of GDP Since assuming office
in January 1996 President ARZU has worked to implement a program of
economic liberalization and political modernization The signing of
the Peace Accords in December 1996 which ended 36 years of civil war
removed a major obstacle to foreign investment In 1997 Guatemala met
its economic targets when GDP growth accelerated to 41 and inflation
fell to 9 The government also increased tax revenueshistorically
the lowest in Latin Americato 9 of GDP and created a new tax
administration It also successfully placed 150 million in
dollardenominated notes in the international markets Debt service
costs should decline in 1998 Remaining challenges for the
administration in 1998 include completing a deal with the IMF and
stabilizing monetary policy Throughout 1997 the Central Bank
maintained a tight money supply helping to control inflation but it
also caused high interest rates and led to operating losses for the
bank Early in 1998 it relaxed its monetary policy in an effort to
correct these problems but increased pressure on the quetzal has
prompted the bank to intervene to prop up its value

GuineaBissauEconomy

Economyoverview One of the 20 poorest countries in the world
GuineaBissau depends mainly on farming and fishing Cashew crops have
increased remarkably in recent years and the country now ranks sixth
in cashew production GuineaBissau exports fish and seafood along
with small amounts of peanuts palm kernels and timber Rice is the
major crop and staple food Trade reform and price liberalization are
the most successful part of the countrys structural adjustment
program under IMF sponsorship The tightening of monetary policy and
the development of the private sector have begun to reinvigorate the
economy Inflation dropped sharply in the first quarter of 1997
Membership in the WAMU West African Monetary Union begun in May
1997 should help support 5 annual growth and contribute to fiscal
discipline Because of high costs the development of petroleum
phosphate and other mineral resources is not a nearterm prospect

GuyanaEconomy

Economyoverview In 1997 Guyana one of the poorest countries in the
Western Hemisphere posted its sixth straight year of economic growth
of 5 or better with the advance led by gold and bauxite mining and
by sugar growing Favorable growth factors have included expansion in
the key agricultural and mining sectors a more favorable atmosphere
for business initiative a more realistic exchange rate a moderate
inflation rate and the continued support of international
organizations Serious underlying economic problems will continue
Electric power has been in short supply and constitutes a major
barrier to future gains in national output The government must
persist in efforts to manage its sizable external debt and extend its
privatization program

HaitiEconomy

Economyoverview About 75 of the population lives in abject poverty
Nearly 70 of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector which
consists mainly of smallscale subsistence farming and employs about
twothirds of the economically active work force The country has
experienced little or no job creation since President PREVAL took
office in February 1996 although the informal economy is growing
Failure to reach agreements with international sponsors have denied
Haiti badly needed budget and development assistance Meeting aid
conditions in 1998 will be especially challenging in the face of
mounting popular criticism of reforms

HondurasEconomy

Economyoverview In 1994 the REINA administration inherited an
economy in the grips of stagflation due to an unprecedented energy
crisis declining agricultural output and extravagant public
expenditures In response the REINA administration cut the fiscal
deficit and enacted a number of structural reforms including passage
of a modern financial sector reform law in 1995 and a central bank
reform law in 1996 As a result Honduras finished 1997 with improved
GDP growth and a decreasing rate of inflation The newly elected
FLORES administration faces pressure from the international financial
community and the IMF to further decrease the fiscal deficit and
implement key reforms including the privatization of state
enterprises such as Hondutel Tegucigalpa will probably implement
tighter fiscal and monetary policies to keep inflation low and meet
commitments to the IMF This may slow GDP growth to 35 in 1998
Moreover wage increases for publicsector employees agreed to in
1997 will make it difficult for FLORES to make headway on the fiscal
deficit and inflation

IcelandEconomy

Economyoverview Icelands Scandinaviantype economy is basically
capitalistic yet with an extensive welfare system low unemployment
and remarkably even distribution of income The economy depends
heavily on the fishing industry which provides 75 of export earnings
and employs 12 of the work force In the absence of other natural
resourcesexcept energyIcelands economy is vulnerable to changing
world fish prices The economy remains sensitive to declining fish
stocks as well as to drops in world prices for its main exports fish
and fish products aluminum and ferrosilicon The centerright
government plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and
current account deficits limiting foreign borrowing containing
inflation revising agricultural and fishing policies diversifying
the economy and privatizing stateowned industries The government
remains opposed to EU membership primarily because of Icelanders
concern about losing control over their fishing resources Growth is
likely to slow in 1998 to a still respectable 39

IndiaEconomy

Economyoverview Indias economy encompasses traditional village
farming modern agriculture handicrafts a wide range of modern
industries and a multitude of support services 67 of Indias labor
force of nearly 400 million work in agriculture which contributes 30
of the countrys GDP Production trade and investment reforms since
1991 have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons and an
estimated 300 million middle class consumers New Delhi has avoided
debt rescheduling attracted foreign investment and revived
confidence in Indias economic prospects since 1991 Many of the
countrys fundamentals  including savings rates 26 of GDP and
reserves now about 24 billion  are healthy Inflation eased to 7
in 1997 and interest rates dropped to between 10 and 13 Even so
the Indian Government needs to restore the early momentum of reform
especially by continuing reductions in the extensive remaining
government regulations Moreover economic policy changes have not yet
significantly increased jobs or reduced the risk that international
financial strains will reemerge within the next few years Nearly 40
of the Indian population remains too poor to afford an adequate diet
Indias exports currency and foreign institutional investment were
affected by the East Asian crisis in late 1997 and early 1998 but
capital account controls a low ratio of shortterm debt to reserves
and enhanced supervision of the financial sector helped insulate it
from near term balanceofpayments problems Export growth has been
slipping in 199697 averaging only about 4 to 5a large drop from
the more than 20 increases it was experiencing over the prior three
yearsmainly because of the fall in Asian currencies relative to the
rupee Energy telecommunications and transportation shortages and
the legacy of inefficient factories constrain industrial growth which
expanded only 67 in 1997down from more than 11 in 1996 Growth of
the agricultural sector is still fairly slow rebounding to only 57
in 1997 from a fall of 01 in 1996 Agricultural investment has
slowed while costly subsidies on fertilizer food distribution and
rural electricity remain Nevertheless even if a series of weak
coalition governments continue to rule in New Delhi over the next few
years and are unable to push reforms aggressively parts of the
economy that have already benefited from deregulation will continue to
grow Indian think tanks project GDP growth of at least 55 in 1998

industrial growth and penalizes India in global markets slow
improvement is taking place with the recent admission of private and

electromechanical and manual switchboard systems within the last 10
years a substantial amount of digital switch gear has been introduced
for local service longdistance traffic is carried mostly by open

IndonesiaEconomy

Economyoverview While Indonesia was long touted for its sound
macroeconomic management and spectacular growth the Asian financial
crisis in 199798 revealed the weak underpinnings of the economy an
unhealthy banking sector untenable levels of private foreign debt
and uncompetitive practices that favored the financial interests of
former President SOEHARTOs family and friends Indonesia sought IMF
assistance early in the crisis and eventually brokered a 42 billion
bailout package but Jakarta jeopardized the program by resisting
strict IMF reforms partly in response to the rupiahs collapse which
lost as much as 80 of its value at one point Economic prospects look
bleak for 1998 the economy probably will shrink between 4 to 10

IraqEconomy

Economyoverview The Bathist regime engages in extensive central
planning and management of industrial production and foreign trade
while leaving some smallscale industry and services and most
agriculture to private enterprise The economy has been dominated by
the oil sector which has traditionally provided about 95 of foreign
exchange earnings In the 1980s financial problems caused by massive
expenditures in the eightyear war with Iran and damage to oil export
facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures
and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments Iraq
suffered economic losses of at least 100 billion from the war After
the end of hostilities in 1988 oil exports gradually increased with
the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
facilities Agricultural development remained hampered by labor
shortages salinization and dislocations caused by previous land
reform and collectivization programs The industrial sector although
accorded high priority by the government also was under financial
constraints Iraqs seizure of Kuwait in August 1990 subsequent
international economic embargoes and military action by an
international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed
the economic picture The UNsponsored economic embargo has reduced
exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in prices
The Iraqi Government has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so
that the economic embargo could be removed The governments policies
of supporting large military and internal security forces and of
allocating resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated
shortages Industrial and transportation facilities which suffered
severe damage have been partially restored At current prices oil
exports are about onethird of their prewar level because of the
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 986the UNs
oilforgoods programin December 1996 Shortages of spare parts
continue In accord with the oilforgoods deal Iraq is allowed to
export 2 billion worth of oil in exchange for badly needed food and
medicine The first oil was pumped in December 1996 and the first
supplies of food and medicine arrived in April 1997 Per capita output
for 199597 and living standards are well below the 198990 level but
any estimates have a wide range of error

IrelandEconomy

Economyoverview The economy is small and trade dependent
Agriculture once the most important sector is now dwarfed by
industry which accounts for 38 of GDP about 80 of exports and
employs 27 of the labor force Although exports remain the primary
engine for Irelands robust growth the economy is also benefiting
from a rise in consumer spending and recovery in both construction and
business investment Since the 1980s inflation has fallen sharply and
chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses
Unemployment remains a serious problem however and job creation is
the main focus of government policy To ease unemployment Dublin
aggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new
industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms

IsraelEconomy

Economyoverview Israel has a technologically advanced market economy
with substantial government participation It depends on imports of
crude oil grains raw materials and military equipment Despite
limited natural resources Israel has intensively developed its
agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years
Manufacturing and construction employ about 28 of Israeli workers
agriculture forestry and fishing only 26 and services the rest
Israel is largely selfsufficient in food production except for
grains Diamonds hightechnology equipment and agricultural products
fruits and vegetables are leading exports Israel usually posts
sizable current account deficits which are covered by large transfer
payments from abroad and by foreign loans Roughly half of the
governments external debt is owed to the US which is its major
source of economic and military aid To earn needed foreign exchange
Israel has been targeting hightechnology niches in international
markets such as medical scanning equipment The influx of Jewish
immigrants from the former USSR topped 750000 during the period
198997 bringing the population of Israel from the former Soviet
Union to one million or onesixth of the total population Initially
this great influx increased unemployment intensified housing
problems and strained the government budget At the same time the
immigrants bring to the economy scientific and professional expertise
of substantial value for the future

ItalyEconomy

Economyoverview Since World War II the Italian economy has changed
from one based on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy with
approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the
UK This basically capitalistic economy is still divided into a
developed industrial north dominated by private companies and a less
developed agricultural south with large public enterprises and more
than 20 unemployment Most raw materials needed by industry and over
75 of energy requirements must be imported In the second half of
1992 Rome became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to
participate in EU plans for economic and monetary union later in the
decade thus it finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances
Subsequently the government has adopted fairly stringent budgets
abandoned its inflationary wage indexation system and started to
scale back its generous social welfare programs including pension and
health care benefits In November 1996 the lire rejoined the European
monetary system which it had left in September 1992 when under
extreme pressure in currency markets Italy faces the problem of
restructuring its economy to meet Maastricht criteria for inclusion in
the EMU together with other problems of refurbishing a tottering
communications system curbing industrial pollution and adjusting to
new EU and global competitive forces

JamaicaEconomy

Economyoverview Key sectors in this island economy are bauxite
alumina and bauxite account for more than half of exports and
tourism Since assuming office in 1992 Prime Minister PATTERSON has
eliminated most price controls streamlined tax schedules and
privatized government enterprises Continued tight monetary and fiscal
policies have helped slow inflation and stabilize the exchange rate
but have resulted in the slowdown of economic growth moving from
15 in 1992 to 05 in 1995 In 1996 GDP was in negative growth
14 and remained so in 1997 Serious problems include high
interest rates increased foreign competition the weak financial
condition of business in general resulting in receiverships or
closures and downsizings of companies the shift in investment
portfolios to nonproductive shortterm high yield instruments a
pressured sometimes sliding exchange rate a widening merchandise
trade deficit and a growing internal debt for government bailouts to
various ailing sectors of the economy Jamaicas mediumterm prospects
will depend upon encouraging investment in the productive sectors
maintaining a competitive exchange rate stabilizing the labor
environment and implementing proper fiscal and monetary policies

JapanEconomy

Economyoverview Governmentindustry cooperation a strong work
ethic mastery of high technology and a comparatively small defense
allocation roughly 1 of GDP have helped Japan advance with
extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most powerful economy in
the world One notable characteristic of the economy is the working
together of manufacturers suppliers and distributors in closely knit
groups called keiretsu A second basic feature has been the guarantee
of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor
force this guarantee is eroding Industry the most important sector
of the economy is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
fuels The much smaller agricultural sector is highly subsidized and
protected with crop yields among the highest in the world Usually
selfsufficient in rice Japan must import about 50 of its
requirements of other grain and fodder crops Japan maintains one of
the worlds largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the
global catch For three decades overall real economic growth had been
spectacular a 10 average in the 1960s a 5 average in the 1970s
and a 4 average in the 1980s Growth slowed markedly in 199295
largely because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during the late
1980s and contractionary domestic policies intended to wring
speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets Growth
picked up to 39 in 1996 largely a reflection of stimulative fiscal
and monetary policies as well as low rates of inflation But in 1997
growth fell back to 1 As a result of the expansionary fiscal
policies and declining tax revenues due to the recession Japan has
one of the largest budget deficits as a percent of GDP among the
industrialized countries The crowding of habitable land area and the
aging of the population are two other major longrun problems

JerseyEconomy

Economyoverview The economy is based largely on financial services
agriculture and tourism Potatoes cauliflower tomatoes and
especially flowers are important export crops shipped mostly to the
UK The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents
an important export earner Milk products go to the UK and other EU
countries In 1986 the finance sector overtook tourism as the main
contributor to GDP accounting for 40 of the islands output In
recent years the government has encouraged light industry to locate
in Jersey with the result that an electronics industry has developed
alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear All raw material
and energy requirements are imported as well as a large share of
Jerseys food needs Light tax and death duties make the island a
popular tax haven

JordanEconomy

Economyoverview Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil and coal
Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the
late 1970s and early 1980s when its annual real GNP growth averaged
more than 10 In the remainder of the 1980s however reductions in
both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an
average of roughly 2 per year Importsmainly oil capital goods
consumer durables and foodoutstripped exports with the difference
covered by aid remittances and borrowing In mid1989 the Jordanian
Government began debtrescheduling negotiations and agreed to
implement an IMFsupported program designed to gradually reduce the
budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms The
Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990 however aggravated
Jordans already serious economic problems forcing the government to
shelve the IMF program stop most debt payments and suspend
rescheduling negotiations Aid from Gulf Arab states worker
remittances and trade contracted and refugees flooded the country
producing serious balanceofpayments problems stunting GDP growth
and straining government resources The economy rebounded in 1992
largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning
from the Gulf but recovery was uneven in 199497 The government is
implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and continues to
secure rescheduling and writeoffs of its heavy foreign debt Debt
poverty and unemployment remain Jordans biggest ongoing problems

KazakhstanEconomy

Economyoverview Kazakhstan the second largest of the former Soviet
republics in territory possesses enormous untapped fossil fuel
reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals
It also has considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe
lands accommodating both livestock and grain production Kazakhstans
industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building
sector specializing in construction equipment tractors agricultural
machinery and some defense items The breakup of the USSR and the
collapse of demand for Kazakhstans traditional heavy industry
products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since
1991 with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994 In 199597
the pace of the government program of economic reform and
privatization quickened resulting in a substantial shifting of assets
into the private sector The December 1996 signing of the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium agreement to build a new pipeline from western
Kazakhstans Tengiz oil field to the Black Sea increases prospects for
substantially larger oil exports in several years The emigration of
large numbers of skilled Slavic managers and technicians from the
northern industrial areas will hold back future growth

KenyaEconomy

Economyoverview Since 1993 the government of Kenya has implemented
a program of economic liberalization and reform Steps have included
the removal of import licensing and price controls removal of foreign
exchange controls fiscal and monetary restraint and reduction of the
public sector through privatizing publicly owned companies and
downsizing the civil service With the support of the World Bank IMF
and other donors these reforms have led to a turnaround in economic
performance following a period of negative growth in the early 1990s
Kenyas real GDP grew at 5 in 1995 and 4 in 1996 and inflation
remained under control Growth slowed in 1997 Political violence
damaged the tourist industry and the IMF allowed Kenyas Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Program to lapse due to the governments failure
to enact reform conditions and to adequately address public sector
corruption Moreover El Nino rains destroyed crops and damaged an
already crumbling infrastructure in 1997 and on into 1998 Longterm
barriers to development include electricity shortages the
governments continued and inefficient dominance of key sectors
endemic corruption and the countrys high population growth rate

KiribatiEconomy

Economyoverview A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls
Kiribati has few national resources Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
1979 Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports
The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years Real GDP growth has
declined from about 10 in 1988 to about 26 in 1995 and 19 in
1996 Growth in 1997 was expected to parallel the 1996 performance
Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers
weak infrastructure and remoteness from international markets The
financial sector is at an early stage of development as is the
expansion of private sector initiatives Foreign financial aid
largely from the UK and Japan is a critical supplement to GDP equal
in amount to 2550 of GDP in recent years Remittances from workers
abroad account for more than 5 million each year

Korea NorthEconomy

Economyoverview More than 90 of this command economy is socialized
agricultural land is collectivized and stateowned industry produces
95 of manufactured goods State control of economic affairs is
unusually tight even for a communist country because of the small size
and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Ilsong in
the past and now his son KIM Chongil Economic growth during the
period 198488 averaged 23 but output declined by an average of
45 or more annually during 198997 because of systemic problems and
disruptions in economic and technological links with the former USSR
and China The leadership has insisted on maintaining its high level
of military outlays from a shrinking economic pie Moreover a serious
drawdown in inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector
have led to increasing interruptions in industrial production
Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have formed the basis of
industrial development since World War II Manufacturing is centered
on heavy industry including military industry with light industry
lagging far behind Despite the use of improved seed varieties
expansion of irrigation and the heavy use of fertilizers North Korea
is not yet selfsufficient in food production Indeed a shortage of
arable lands several years of poor harvests systemic inefficiencies
a cumbersome distribution system and extensive floods in 199596
followed by a severe drought in 1997 have resulted in increasingly
serious food shortages Substantial grain shipments from Japan and
South Korea are offsetting a portion of the losses North Korea
remains far behind South Korea in economic development and living
standards

Korea SouthEconomy

Economyoverview As one of the Four Dragons of East Asia South Korea
has achieved an incredible record of growth Three decades ago its GDP
per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of
Africa and Asia Today its GDP per capita is eight times Indias 15
times North Koreas and already up with the lesser economies of the
European Union This success through the late 1980s was achieved by a
system of close government business ties including directed credit
import restrictions sponsorship of specific industries and a strong
labor effort The government promoted the import of raw materials and
technology at the expense of consumer goods and encouraged savings and
investment over consumption The Asian financial crisis of 199798
exposed certain longstanding weaknesses in South Koreas development
model including high debtequity ratios massive foreign borrowing
and an undisciplined financial sector Also a number of private
sector conglomerates are near bankruptcy At yearend 1997 an
international effort spearheaded by the IMF was underway to shore up
reserves and stabilize the economy Growth in 1998 will be sharply
cut Longterm growth will depend on how successfully South Korea
implements planned economic reforms that would bolster the financial
sector improve corporate management and open the economy further to
foreign participation

KuwaitEconomy

Economyoverview Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with
proved crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels10 of world
reserves Kuwait has rebuilt its warravaged petroleum sector its
crude oil production averaged 2 million barrels per day in 1996
Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP 90 of export revenues and
75 of government income Kuwait lacks water and has practically no
arable land thus preventing development of agriculture With the
exception of fish it depends almost wholly on food imports About 75
of potable water must be distilled or imported Because of its high
per capita income Kuwait provides its citizens with extensive health
educational and retirement benefits The bulk of the work force is
nonKuwaiti living at a considerably lower level Per capita military
expenditures are among the highest in the world The economy improved
moderately in 199497 with the growth in industry and finance The
World Bank has urged Kuwait to push ahead with privatization
including in the oil industry but the government will move slowly on
opening the petroleum sector

LaosEconomy

Economyoverview The government of Laosone of the few remaining
official communist stateshas been decentralizing control and
encouraging private enterprise since 1986 The results starting from
an extremely low base have been striking  growth averaged 7 in
198896 Because Laos depends heavily on its trade with Thailand it
fell victim to the financial crisis in the region in 1997 when growth
was a mere 15 Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive
infrastructure It has no railroads a rudimentary road system and
limited external and internal telecommunications Electricity is
available in only a few urban areas Subsistence agriculture accounts
for half of GDP and provides 80 of total employment The predominant
crop is glutinous rice In nondrought years Laos is selfsufficient
overall in food but each year flood pests and localized drought
cause shortages in various parts of the country For the foreseeable
future the economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and
other international sources Japan is currently the largest bilateral
aid donor aid from the former USSREastern Europe has been cut
sharply As in many developing countries deforestation and soil
erosion will hamper efforts to regain a high rate of GDP growth

achievements since independence in 1991 with GDP growing by 6 and
inflation at 74 GDP is expected to grow 5 in 1998 and inflation to
range between 6 and 7 In 1997 Latvia continued its strict fiscal
policy and apparently ended the year with a small fiscal surplus
reflecting higherthanexpected income from customs revenues excise
and business taxes and restraints on government spending Foreign
direct investment FDI in 1997 was a record 880 million by yearend
Prospects for increasing FDI in 1998 are good if Latvia privatizes at
least some of its large companies including Venspils Nafta the state
oil company Although Latvia was disappointed that it was not
included among the five Central and East European states invited to
start EU accession talks in spring 1998 it is likely to join the WTrO
in 1998 Latvias growing current account and trade deficits remain a

LEBANON

Introduction

Current issues Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its
political institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since
the end of the devastating 16year civil war which began in 1975
Under the Taif Accordthe blueprint for national reconciliationthe
Lebanese have established a more equitable political system
particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political process
while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the government Since
the end of the civil war the Lebanese have formed five cabinets and
conducted two legislative elections Most of the militias have been
weakened or disbanded The Lebanese Armed Forces LAF has seized vast
quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended
central government authority over about onehalf of the country
Hizballah the radical Shia party retains most of its weapons
Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon Israel maintains troops
in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia the Army
of South Lebanon ASL along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous
to its border The ASLs enclave encompasses this selfdeclared
security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of
Jazzin Syria maintains about 25000 troops in Lebanon These troops
are based mainly in Beirut North Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley
Syrias deployment was legitimized by the Arab League during Lebanons
civil war and in the Taif accord Citing the continued weakness of
the LAF Beiruts requests and failure of the Lebanese Government to
implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Taif accord
Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its troops from Lebanon

LebanonEconomy

Economyoverview The 197591 civil war seriously damaged Lebanons
economic infrastructure cut national output by half and all but
ended Lebanons position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub
Peace has enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut
begin collecting taxes and regain access to key port and government
facilities Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound
banking system and resilient small and mediumscale manufacturers
with family remittances banking services manufactured and farm
exports and international aid as the main sources of foreign
exchange Lebanons economy has made impressive gains since Prime
Minister HARIRI launched his 18 billion Horizon 2000 reconstruction
program in 1993 Real GDP grew 8 in 1994 and 7 in 1995 before
Israels Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic
activity During 199297 annual inflation fell from more than 170 to
9 and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than 4 billion from
14 billion Burgeoning capital inflows have generated foreign
payments surpluses and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively
stable Progress also has been made in rebuilding Lebanons wartorn
physical and financial infrastructure Solidere a 2billion firm is
managing the reconstruction of Beiruts central business district the
stock market reopened in January 1996 and international banks and
insurance companies are returning The government nonetheless faces
serious challenges in the economic arena It has had to fund
reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting
borrowing The stalled peace process and ongoing violence in southern
Lebanon could lead to wider hostilities that would disrupt vital
capital inflows Furthermore the gap between rich and poor has
widened since HARIRI took office resulting in grassroots
dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstructions
benefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding
infrastructure to improving living conditions

LesothoEconomy

Economyoverview Small landlocked and mountainous Lesotho has no
important natural resources other than water Its economy is based on
agriculture light manufacturing and remittances from miners employed
in South Africa The number of such mine workers has declined steadily
over the past five years in 1996 their remittances added about 33 to
GDP compared with the addition of roughly 67 in 1990 Manufacturing
depends largely on farm products which support the milling canning
leather and jute industries Recent foreign investments will enable
Lesotho to export garments made from imported textiles Although
drought has decreased agricultural activity over the past few years
completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 now permits
the sale of water to South Africa and will support the economys
continued expansion The pace of the privatization of stateowned
firms increased toward the end of 1994

LiberiaEconomy

Economyoverview Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberias
economy especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia Many
businessmen have fled the country taking capital and expertise with
them Some returned during 1997 Many will not return Richly endowed
with water mineral resources forests and a climate favorable to
agriculture Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
products while local manufacturing mainly foreign owned had been
small in scope The democratically elected government installed in
August 1997 inherited massive international debts and currently
relies on revenues from its maritime registry to provide the bulk of
its foreign exchange earnings The restoration of the infrastructure
and the raising of incomes in this ravaged economy depends on
continued disarmament of factions and the implementation of sound
macro and microeconomic policies of the new government

LibyaEconomy

Economyoverview The socialistoriented economy depends primarily
upon revenues from the oil sector which contributes practically all
export earnings and about onethird of GDP Per capita GDP is the
highest in Africa at 6700 but disproportionately little of national
income flows down to the lower orders of society GDP growth
fluctuates sharply in response to changes in the world oil market GDP
has either contracted or grown very sluggishly since 1992 Import
restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to periodic
shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs The nonoil manufacturing and
construction sectors which account for about 20 of GDP have
expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the
production of petrochemicals iron steel and aluminum Although
agriculture accounts for only 5 of GDP it employs 18 of the labor
force Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output
and Libya imports about 75 of its food requirements The UN sanctions
imposed in April 1992 do not have a major impact on the economy
although they have increased transaction and transportation costs

approach to market reform and its adherence to strict fiscal and
monetary policies imposed by the IMF measures that have helped
constrain the growth of the money supply reduce inflation to 86
and support GDP growth of 6 in 1997 Inflation is expected to fall in
1998 to 6 and GDP to grow at close to 7 Foreign direct investment
in 1997 of some 430 million pushed the country over the 1 billion
mark the first Baltic state to reach this milestone However the
current account deficit has hovered around 8 to 10 of GDP annually
since 1995the result of greater demand for consumer goods and falling

Macedonia The Former Yugoslav Republic ofEconomy

Economyoverview The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia although
the poorest republic in the former Yugoslav federation can meet basic
food and energy needs through its own agricultural and coal resources
The economy slowly rebounded in 199697 after years of recession
Continued recovery depends on Macedonias ability to attract
investment to redevelop trade ties with Greece and Serbia and
Montenegro and to maintain its commitment to economic liberalization
The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and
most of its modern machinery and parts An important supplement of GDP
is the remittances from thousands of Macedonians working in Germany
and other West European nations

Economyoverview Madagascar suffers from chronic malnutrition
underfunded health and education facilities a roughly 3 annual
population growth rate and severe loss of forest cover accompanied
by erosion Agriculture including fishing and forestry is the
mainstay of the economy accounting for 33 of GDP and contributing
more than 70 to export earnings Industry features textile
manufacturing and the processing of agricultural products Growth in
output in 199297 averaged less than the growth rate of the
population Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and
demonstrations a decline in world coffee demand and the erratic
commitment of the government to economic reform Formidable obstacles
stand in the way of Madagascars realizing its considerable growth
potential the extent of government reforms outside financial aid
and foreign investment will be key determinants

MalaysiaEconomy

Economyoverview After decades of high GDP growth Malaysias
economyshaken by the ongoing regional financial crisis in 199798is
forecast by the government to grow only 45 in 1998 private
forecasts project the growth rate could be as low as 2 The sharp
decline in local currency and stock markets forced Kuala Lumpur to
announce tough costcutting measureson top of a contractionary
budgetto further reduce the current account deficit to 3 of GDP in
1998 from 55 in 1997 To achieve this goal Kuala Lumpur will cut
government spending by 20 and continue to slash bigticket imports
and defer largescale infrastructure projects Government austerity
and slower growth mean increased unemployment and higher interest
rates that will bite into corporate earnings

Economyoverview Tourism Maldives largest industry accounts for
about 18 of GDP and more than 60 of the Maldives foreign exchange
receipts Over 90 of government tax revenue comes from import duties
and tourismrelated taxes About 350000 tourists visited the islands
in 1997 Fishing is a second leading growth sector The Maldivian
Government began an economic reform program in 1989 initially by
lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the private sector
Subsequently it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign
investment Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a minor
role in the economy constrained by the limited availability of
cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor Most staple foods
must be imported Industry which consists mainly of garment
production boat building and handicrafts accounts for about 15 of
GDP Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of erosion and
possible global warming on their lowlying country 80 of the area is

Economyoverview US Government assistance is the mainstay of the
economy constituting an important supplement to GDP Agricultural
production is concentrated on small farms and the most important
commercial crops are coconuts tomatoes melons and breadfruit
Smallscale industry is limited to handicrafts fish processing and
copra The tourist industry now a small source of foreign exchange
employing less than 10 of the labor force remains the best hope for
future added income The islands have few natural resources and
imports far exceed exports The government is drafting economic
reforms designed to increase revenue and compensate for reductions in
US Government grantsin FY9596 the US Government provided grants of
68 million equal to roughly 70 of the countrys GDP More than 25
of the governments FY9596 budget was devoted to debt repayment In
1996 efforts to stabilize the economy included a 27 reduction in the

MartiniqueEconomy

Economyoverview The economy is based on sugarcane bananas tourism
and light industry Agriculture accounts for about 6 of GDP and the
small industrial sector for 11 Sugar production has declined with
most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum Banana
exports are increasing going mostly to France The bulk of meat
vegetable and grain requirements must be imported contributing to a
chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from
France Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as
a source of foreign exchange The majority of the work force is
employed in the service sector and in administration

MauritaniaEconomy

Economyoverview A majority of the population still depends on
agriculture and livestock for a livelihood even though most of the
nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by
recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s Mauritania has extensive
deposits of iron ore which account for almost 50 of total exports
The decline in world demand for this ore however has led to cutbacks
in production The nations coastal waters are among the richest
fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners
threatens this key source of revenue The countrys first deepwater
port opened near Nouakchott in 1986 In recent years drought and
economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of
foreign debt The government has begun the second stage of an economic
reform program in consultation with the World Bank the IMF and major
donor countries Shortterm growth prospects are poor because of the
heavy debt service burden rapid population growth and vulnerability
to climatic conditions

MexicoEconomy

Economyoverview Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture of
modern and outmoded industry and agriculture increasingly dominated
by the private sector The number of stateowned enterprises in Mexico
has fallen from more than 1000 in 1982 to fewer than 200 in 1998 The
ZEDILLO administration is privatizing and expanding competition in sea
ports railroads telecommunications electricity natural gas
distribution and airports The Mexican economy is in its third year
of recovery from the recession of 1995 which was touched off by a
financial crisis After declining 62 in 1995 real GDP grew 51 in
1996 and 73 in 1997 and is expected to rise by 5 in 1998 A strong
export sector helped to cushion the economys decline in 1995 and led
the recovery in 1996 and 1997 Private consumption spending in 1998
probably will rise by at least 4 on the strength of increased
employment and rising real wages and the troubled banking sector is
likely to increase lending for the first time in three years Despite
the spillover from the Asian crisis the mediumterm outlook for
Mexico remains positive with government and private sector economists
projecting average annual growth of 4 to 5 through the year 2000
Mexico still needs to overcome many structural problems as it strives
to modernize its economy and raise living standards Income
distribution is very unequal with the top 20 of income earners
accounting for 55 of income The inefficient agricultural sector
employs 20 to 25 of the labor force but produces only 8 of GDP
Trade with the United States and Canada has nearly doubled since NAFTA
was implemented in 1994 Mexico is pursuing additional trade
agreements with most countries in Latin America and with the European
Union to lessen its dependence on the United States which accounts
for 80 of Mexicos total trade

exploiting except for highgrade phosphate The potential for a
tourist industry exists but the remoteness of the location and a lack
of adequate facilities hinder development Financial assistance from

1 billion in the islands in the 1990s Geographical isolation and a

MoldovaEconomy

Economyoverview Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland
but has no major mineral deposits As a result the economy depends
heavily on agriculture featuring fruits vegetables wine and
tobacco Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil coal and
natural gas largely from Russia Energy shortages contributed to
sharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in
1991 The Moldovan Government has recently been making progress on an
ambitious economic reform agenda As part of its reform efforts
Moldova introduced a stable convertible currency freed all prices
stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises and backed
steady land privatization removed export controls and freed interest
rates The IMF has suspended payment on Moldovas Extended Fund
Facility since November 1997 due to concerns about the budget deficit
and money supply growth In late December Parliament agreed to a lower
1998 budget deficit to address IMF and World Bank concerns

MongoliaEconomy

Economyoverview The government has embraced freemarket economics
freezing spending easing price controls liberalizing domestic and
international trade Mongolias severe climate scattered population
and wide expanses of unproductive land however have constrained
economic development Economic activity traditionally has been based
on agriculture and the breeding of livestock In past years extensive
mineral resources had been developed with Soviet support total Soviet
assistance at its height amounted to 30 of GDP but disappeared
almost overnight in 199091 The mining and processing of coal
copper molybdenum tin tungsten and gold account for a large part
of industrial production The Mongolian leadership has been soliciting
support from foreign donors who pledged some 250 million in aid in
October 1997 Economic growth picked up in 1997 after stalling in 1996
due to a series of natural disasters and declines in world prices of

MoroccoEconomy

Economyoverview Morocco faces the problems typical of developing
countriesrestraining government spending reducing constraints on
private activity and foreign trade and keeping inflation within
manageable bounds Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an
economic program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF
the World Bank and the Paris Club of creditors The dirham is now
fully convertible for current account transactions reforms of the
financial sector have been implemented and state enterprises are
slowly being privatized Drought conditions in 1997 depressed activity
in the key agricultural sector holding down exports and contributing
to a 22 contraction in real GDP Favorable rainfalls in the fall of
1997 have led to forecasts of robust 89 real GDP growth in 1998
Servicing the external debt preparing the economy for freer trade
with the European Union improving education and living standards and
finding jobs for Moroccos youthful population remain longterm
challenges

MozambiqueEconomy

Economyoverview Before the peace accord of October 1992 Mozambique
had been devastated by civil war and was one of the poorest countries
on the globe Prospects subsequently improved and with its solid
economic performance in 199697 Mozambique has begun to exploit its
sizable agricultural hydropower and transportation resources
Foreign assistance programs help supply the foreign exchange required
to support the budget and pay for imports of goods and services The
restoration of electrical transmission lines to South Africa and the
completion of a new transmission line to Zimbabwe permitting the
giant Cahora Bassa hydropower plant to export large amounts of
electricity proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline to South
Africa and reform of transportation services will greatly improve
foreign exchange receipts The Mozambique and South African
Governments are developing the Maputo corridor linking the port of
Maputo with Witbank South Africa In the past few years more than
700 state enterprises have been privatized including the countrys
largest commercial bank and a number of sizable manufacturing firms
Other pending reform measures are the reform of tax collection and the
facilitation of private enterprise in the transportation energy and
telecommunications sectors

NamibiaEconomy

Economyoverview The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction
and processing of minerals for export Mining accounts for 20 of GDP
Namibia is the fourthlargest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa
and the worlds fifthlargest producer of uranium Rich alluvial
diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gemquality
diamonds Namibia also produces large quantities of lead zinc tin
silver and tungsten Half of the population depends on agriculture
largely subsistence agriculture for its livelihood Namibia must
import some of its food Although per capita GDP is three to six times
the per capita GDP of Africas poorest countries the majority of
Namibias people live in pronounced poverty because of the great
inequality of income distribution and the large amounts going to
foreigners The Namibian economy has close links to South Africa

NauruEconomy

Economyoverview Revenues come from the export of phosphates the
reserves of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000
Phosphates have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes
in the Third World but incomes probably will drop sharply in the
future Few other resources exist so most necessities must be
imported including fresh water from Australia The rehabilitation of
mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious
longterm problems Substantial amounts of phosphate income are
invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition However
dividends from the trusts have declined sharply since 1990 and the
government has been borrowing heavily from the trusts to finance
fiscal deficits In an effort to stem further escalation of fiscal
problems the government has called for a freeze on wages for two
years a reduction of overstaffed public service departments drastic
cutbacks in hiring new government staff privatization of numerous
government agencies and closure of some overseas consulates

NepalEconomy

Economyoverview Nepal is among the poorest and least developed
countries in the world with more than half of its population living
below the poverty line Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy
providing a livelihood for over 80 of the population and accounting
for 40 of GDP Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of
agricultural produce including jute sugarcane tobacco and grain
Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and accounted
for about 80 of foreign exchange earnings in the past two years
Apart from agricultural land and forests exploitable natural
resources are mica hydropower and tourism Agricultural production
is growing by about 5 on average as compared with annual population
growth of 25 Since May 1991 the government has been moving forward
with economic reforms particularly those that encourage trade and
foreign investment eg by eliminating business licenses and
registration requirements in order to simplify investment procedures
The government has also been cutting expenditures by reducing
subsidies privatizing state industries and laying off civil
servants More recently however political instability  five
different governments over the past few yearshas hampered Kathmandus
ability to forge consensus to implement key economic reforms Nepal
has considerable scope for accelerating economic growth by exploiting
its potential in hydropower and tourism areas where there has
recently been foreign investment interest Prospects for foreign trade
or investment in other areas will remain poor however because of the
small size of the economy its technological backwardness its
remoteness its landlocked geographic location and its susceptibility
to natural disaster The international communitys role of funding
more than 60 of Nepals development budget and more than 28 of total
budgetary expenditures will likely continue as a major ingredient of
growth

Economyoverview This highly developed and affluent economy is based
on private enterprise The government makes its presence felt
however through many regulations permit requirements and welfare
programs affecting most aspects of economic activity Industrial
activity features foodprocessing oilrefining and metalworking The
highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 of the labor
force but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic
foodprocessing industry Indeed the Netherlands ranks third
worldwide in value of agricultural exports behind the US and France
Sharp cuts in subsidy and social security spending have been
accompanied by sustained growth in output and employment Growth in
1998 should be a brisk 35 The Dutch will almost certainly qualify
for the first wave of countries entering the European Monetary Union

New CaledoniaEconomy

Economyoverview New Caledonia has more than 20 of the worlds known
nickel resources In recent years the economy has suffered because of
depressed international demand for nickel the principal source of
export earnings Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for
cultivation and food accounts for about 25 of imports In addition
to nickel financial support from France and tourism are key to the
health of the economy The outlook for 1998 is clouded by the
spillover of financial problems in East Asia and by lower expected
prices for nickel

NicaraguaEconomy

Economyoverview The Nicaraguan economy devastated during the 1980s
by economic mismanagement and civil war is beginning to rebound In
1991 President CHAMORRO launched an ambitious economic stabilization
program that reduced inflation and obtained substantial economic aid
from abroad Economic growth rose sharply in 199597 due to surges in
exports and efforts to enhance trade liberalization The program
however hit some snags and a 199497 IMF Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility ESAF signed by the CHAMORRO administration with
the Fund lapsed in September 1996 due to noncompliance In 1997
however the IMF resumed negotiations for an ESAF with the ALEMAN
administration and agreed to an ESAF in 1998 IMF approval of the
ESAF cleared the way for debt relief by the Paris Club later that year
and has opened the way for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries Initiative Implementation of a 1997 property
accorddesigned to resolve conflict over properties confiscated by the
Sandinistas in the 1980sshould also help inspire international
investor confidence Strong growth is forecast for 1998 with
implementation of a 1997 free trade agreement with Mexico expected to
boost agricultural exports although the industrial sector may come
under pressure from increased Mexican competition

NigeriaEconomy

Economyoverview The oilrich Nigerian economy continues to be
hobbled by political instability corruption and poor macroeconomic
management Nigerias unpopular military rulers have failed to make
significant progress in diversifying the economy away from
overdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides 30
of GDP 95 of foreign exchange earnings and about 80 of budgetary
revenues The governments resistance to initiating greater
transparency and accountability in managing the countrys multibillion
dollar oil earnings continues to limit economic growth and prevent an
agreement with the IMF and bilateral creditors on debt relief The
largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed to keep up with
rapid population growth and Nigeria once a large net exporter of
food now must import food Agricultural production in 1996 suffered
from severe shortages of fertilizer and production of fertilizer fell
even further in 1997

Northern Mariana IslandsEconomy

Economyoverview The economy benefits substantially from financial
assistance from the US The rate of funding has declined as locally
generated government revenues have grown An agreement for the years
1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to 228 million for capital
development government operations and special programs Since 1992
funding has been extended one year at a time The commonwealth
received 277 million from FY9394 through FY9596 For FY9697
through FY0203 funding of 11 million will be provided for
infrastructure with an equal local match A rapidly growing chief
source of income is the tourist industry which now employs about 50
of the work force Japanese tourists predominate The agricultural
sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
small farms producing coconuts breadfruit tomatoes and melons
Garment production is the fastest growing industry with employment of
12000 mostly Chinese workers and shipments of 800 million to the US
in 1997 under duty and quota exemptions

NorwayEconomy

Economyoverview Norway is a prosperous bastion of welfare
capitalism The economy consists of a combination of free market
activity and government intervention The government controls key
areas such as the vital petroleum sector through largescale state
enterprises and extensively subsidizes agriculture fishing and
areas with sparse resources Norway maintains an extensive welfare
system that helps propel public sector expenditures to more than 50
of GDP and results in one of the highest average tax levels in the
world A small country with a high dependence on international trade
Norway is basically an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed
goods with an abundance of small and mediumsized firms and is
ranked among the major shipping nations The country is richly endowed
with natural resourcespetroleum hydropower fish forests and
mineralsand is highly dependent on its oil sector Only Saudi Arabia
exports more oil than Norway Norway imports more than half its food
needs Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in
November 1994 Economic growth in 1998 should be about the same as in
1997 Inflation probably will move up toward 3 because of tightness
in labor markets Despite their high per capita incomeoutstripped
among major nations only by the USand their generous welfare
benefits Norwegians worry about that time in the 21st century when
the oil and gas run out

OmanEconomy

Economyoverview Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes
of the oil industry Petroleum accounts for 75 of export earnings and
government revenues and for roughly 40 of GDP Oman has proved oil
reserves of 4 billion barrels equivalent to about 20 years
production at the current rate of extraction Agriculture is carried
on at a subsistence level and the general population depends on
imported food The year 1996 was marked by higher oil production and
prices The government is encouraging private investment both
domestic and foreign as a prime force for further economic
development

tributary water bodies

Areacomparative about 18 times the size of the US the largest ocean
followed by the Atlantic Ocean the Indian Ocean and the Arctic
Ocean covers about onethird of the global surface larger than the
total land area of the world

Coastline 135663 km

Climate planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns
exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east trade winds and
westerly winds are welldeveloped patterns modified by seasonal
fluctuations tropical cyclones hurricanes may form south of Mexico
from June to October and affect Mexico and Central America
continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less
pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same latitude in
the North Pacific Ocean the western Pacific is monsoonala rainy
season occurs during the summer months when moistureladen winds blow
from the ocean over the land and a dry season during the winter
months when dry winds blow from the Asian land mass back to the
ocean tropical cyclones typhoons may strike southeast and East Asia
from May to December

Terrain surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
clockwise warmwater gyre broad circular system of currents and in
the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise coolwater gyre in the
northern Pacific sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk
in winter in the southern Pacific sea ice from Antarctica reaches
its northernmost extent in October the ocean floor in the eastern
Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise while the western
Pacific is dissected by deep trenches including the Mariana Trench
which is the worlds deepest

Natural resources oil and gas fields polymetallic nodules sand and
gravel aggregates placer deposits fish

Natural hazards surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of
Fire subject to tropical cyclones typhoons in southeast and east
Asia from May to December most frequent from July to October
tropical cyclones hurricanes may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October most common in August
and September southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from
Antarctica cyclical El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru
when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent
moves south killing the plankton that is the primary food source for
anchovies consequently the anchovies move to better feeding grounds
causing resident marine birds to starve by the thousands because of
the loss of their food source ships subject to superstructure icing
in extreme north from October to May and in extreme south from May to
October persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime
hazard from June to December

Economyoverview The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the
world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly
touch It provides lowcost sea transportation between East and West
extensive fishing grounds offshore oil and gas fields minerals and
sand and gravel for the construction industry In 1985 over half 54
of the worlds fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean which is the
only ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978
Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
everincreasing role in the energy supplies of Australia NZ China
US and Peru The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas
combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985 has
slowed but not stopped new drillings

PakistanEconomy

Economyoverview Pakistan continues to suffer through a damaging
foreign exchange crisis The crisis stems from years of loose fiscal
policies that exacerbated inflation and allowed the public debt money
supply and current account deficit to explode In April 1997 Prime
Minister SHARIF introduced a stimulus package of tax cuts intended to
boost failing industrial output and spur export growth At that time
the IMF endorsed the program paving the way for a 15 billion
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Although the economy showed
signs of improvement following the measures SHARIF has refused to
implement the tough structural reforms necessary for sustained
longerterm growth As a consequence at yearend 1997 industrial
production continued to flag foreign exchange reserves continued to
teeter around 1 billiononly four weeks of importsand borrowing to
support the budget deficit already exceeded the amount allocated for
the entire fiscal year At the same time the government must cope
with longstanding economic vulnerabilitiesinadequate infrastructure

ParaguayEconomy

Economyoverview Paraguay has a market economy marked by a large
informal sector The informal sector features both reexport of
imported consumer goods electronics whiskeys perfumes cigarettes
and office equipment to neighboring countries as well as the
activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors
The formal sector is largely oriented toward services A large
percentage of the population derive their living from agricultural
activity often on a subsistence basis The formal economy has grown
an average of about 3 over the past five years However population
has increased at about the same rate over the same period leaving per
capita income nearly stagnant The WASMOSY government has continued to
pursue its economic reform agenda albeit with limited success because
of infighting in the ruling party and resistance from the opposition
Paraguays ongoing integration into Mercosur the Southern Cone Common
Market offers potential for investment and growth

PeruEconomy

Economyoverview The Peruvian economy has become increasingly
marketoriented with major privatizations completed since 1990 in the
mining electricity and telecommunications industries In the 1980s
the economy suffered from hyperinflation declining per capita output
and mounting external debt Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank
support in the mid1980s because of its huge debt arrears An
austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government
took office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly
contraction of economic activity but the slide came to a halt late
that year and in 1991 output rose 24 After a burst of inflation as
the austerity program eliminated government price subsidies monthly
price increases eased to the singledigit level and by December 1991
dropped to the lowest increase since mid1987 Lima obtained a
financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 1991
although it faced 14 billion in arrears on its external debt By
working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and
arrangements the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March
1993 In 1992 GDP fell by 28 in part because a warmerthanusual
El Nino current resulted in a 30 drop in the fish catch but the
economy rebounded as strong foreign investment helped push growth to
7 in 1993 about 13 in 1994 and 68 in 1995 Growth slowed to
about 28 in 1996 as the government adopted tight fiscal and monetary
policy to reduce the current account deficit and meet its IMF targets
Growth then rebounded to 73 in 1997 even as inflation fell to its
lowest level in 23 years Capital inflows surged to record levels in
early 1997 and have remained strong despite economic shocks stemming
from the Asian financial crisis and the El Nino weather events

Economyoverview In 1997 the Philippine economy primarily a mixture
of agriculture and light industry continued its fifth year of
positive economic growth led by expansion of exports and investment
The government expects growth to slow to about 3 in 1998 due to
spillover effects of the financial crisis in East Asia The government
has promised to continue its economic reforms to help the Philippines
match the pace of development in the newly industrialized countries of
East Asia The strategy includes improving infrastructure overhauling
the tax system to bolster government revenues and moving toward
further deregulation and privatization of the economy

PolandEconomy

Economyoverview Poland today stands out as one of the most
successful and open transition economies The privatization of small
and medium stateowned companies and a liberal law on establishing new
firms marked the rapid development of a private sector now responsible
for at least twothirds of economic activity In contrast to the
vibrant expansion of private nonfarm activity the large agriculture
component remains handicapped by structural problems surplus labor
inefficient small farms and lack of investment The governments
determination to enter the EU as soon as possible affects all aspects
of its economic policies Improving Polands worsening current account
deficit also is a priority To date the government has resisted
pressure for protectionist solutions and continues to support regional
free trade initiatives The government export strategy emphasizes a
more aggressive export assistance program Warsaw continues to hold
the budget deficit to less than 2 of GDP Further progress on public
finance depends mainly on comprehensive reform of the social welfare
system and privatization of Polands remaining state sector
Restructuring and privatization of sensitive sectors eg coal
steel has been delayed Longawaited privatizations in aviation
energy and telecommunications are scheduled for 1998

the Caribbean region A diverse industrial sector has surpassed
agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and income
Encouraged by dutyfree access to the US and by tax incentives US
firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s US minimum
wage laws apply Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and
other livestock products as the main source of income in the
agricultural sector Tourism has traditionally been an important
source of income for the island with estimated arrivals of nearly 4
million tourists in 1993 The construction sector has been a key
factor in recent economic growth

ReunionEconomy

Economyoverview The economy has traditionally been based on
agriculture Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a
century and in some years it accounts for 85 of exports The
government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to
relieve high unemployment which recently amounted to onethird of the
labor force The gap in Reunion between the welloff and the poor is
extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions The
white and Indian communities are substantially better off than other
segments of the population often approaching European standards
whereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical
of the poorer nations of the African continent The outbreak of severe
rioting in February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic
tensions The economic wellbeing of Reunion depends heavily on
continued financial assistance from France

is continuing its difficult transition to a marketbased economy
After the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 198991 Romania was left
with an obsolete industrial base and a pattern of industrial capacity
wholly unsuited to its needs For the next few years the country
lagged behind most of its neighbors in the pace of restructuring Then
in February 1997 Romania embarked on a comprehensive macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform program The domestic foreign
exchange market was freed and controls on currentaccount
convertibility were removed in October Restructuring programs include
liquidating large energyintensive industries and agricultural and
financial sector reform The private sector share of GDP rose to an
estimated 58 in 1997 however this total includes firms with
governmentheld minority stakes Although progress has been made in
privatizing small and mediumsized firms delays in structural
reformsincluding the postponement of sales of large stateowned
enterprises  threaten plans to revive GDP growth In 1998 GDP will
likely be unchanged and inflation is projected to fall to 45 from
151 in 1997

RussiaEconomy

Economyoverview Russia a vast country with a wealth of natural
resources a welleducated population and a diverse but declining
industrial base continues to experience formidable difficulties in
moving from its old centrally planned economy to a modern market
economy After seven consecutive years of contraction 199096 in which
GDP fell by onethird GDP grew by 04 in 1997 according to official
statistics Moscow continued to make strides in its battle against
inflation which fell to 11 half the 1996 rate The central
government made good on most back wages owed publicsector
employeesincluding the militaryalthough the stock of wage arrears to
employees of private enterprises remained large Privatization
revenues increased significantly largely on the strength of a few
highprofile tenders such as that of telecommunications giant
Svyazinvest On the downside Moscow continued to struggle with a
severe fiscal imbalance Lagging tax collections led the government to
adopt a revised budget in spring 1997 that cut spending by about 20
despite protests from the legislature Russias traditional trade
surplus continued to contractlargely because of soft international
commodity pricesand Moscows WTrO accession made only halting
progress Although President YELTSIN brought in a new economic team
early in 1997 key structural reform initiatives continue to move
slowly A revised tax code remains stuck in the Duma while little
progress is being made on agricultural land reform Small business
development has lagged Prospects for a return to robust growth have
been set back by the spillover from Asias financial turmoil which
hit Russia hard during the last quarter of 1997 Moscow at first tried
to both support the ruble and keep interest rates down but this
policy proved unsustainable and in early December 1997 the Central
Bank let interest rates rise sharply As the year ended Russian
authorities were attempting to put the best face on the financial
situation while at the same time scaling back their previous
optimistic growth projections for 1998 to 12 Because of Russias
severe macroeconomic constraints resources allocated to the military
sector have declined sharply since the implosion of the USSR in

RwandaEconomy

Economyoverview Rwanda is a poor African nation that has suffered
bitterly from ethnicbased civil war The agricultural sector
dominates the economy coffee and tea normally make up 8090 of
exports The amount of fertile land is limited however and
deforestation and soil erosion continue to reduce the production
potential Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of
agricultural products A structural adjustment program with the World
Bank began in October 1990 Civil war in 1990 devastated wide areas
especially in the north and displaced hundreds of thousands of
people A peace accord in mid1993 temporarily ended most of the
fighting but resumption of largescale violence and genocide in April
1994 in the capital city Kigali and elsewhere took 500000 lives in
that year alone and severely damaged already poor economic prospects
In 199496 peace was restored throughout much of the country In
199697 most of the refugees who fled the war returned to Rwanda
Sketchy data suggest that GDP dropped 50 in 1994 and came back
partially by 25 in 1995 Plentiful rains helped agriculture in
1996 and outside aid continued to support this desperately poor
economy The economy continues to face significant challenges in
rehabilitating infrastructure agriculture health care facilities
and capital plant Recovery of domestic production will proceed
slowly

Saint LuciaEconomy

Economyoverview Though foreign investment in manufacturing and
information processing in recent years has increased Saint Lucias
industrial base the economy remains vulnerable due to its heavy
dependence on banana production which is subject to periodic droughts
and tropical storms Indeed the destructive effect of Tropical Storm
Iris in mid1995 caused the loss of 20 of the years banana crop
Increased competition from Latin American bananas will probably
further reduce market prices exacerbating Saint Lucias need to
diversify its economy in coming years eg by further expanding
tourism manufacturing and construction

Saint Pierre and MiquelonEconomy

Economyoverview The inhabitants have traditionally earned their
livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off
the coast of Newfoundland The economy has been declining however
because the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped
steadily over the years In 1992 an arbitration panel awarded the
islands an exclusive economic zone of 12348 sq km to settle a
longstanding territorial dispute with Canada although it represents
only 25 of what France had sought The islands are heavily subsidized

Saint Vincent and the GrenadinesEconomy

Economyoverview Agriculture dominated by banana production is the
most important sector of this lower middle income economy The
services sector based mostly on a growing tourist industry is also
important The government has been relatively unsuccessful at
introducing new industries and high unemployment rates of 3540
continue The continuing dependence on a single crop represents the
biggest obstacle to the islands development tropical storms wiped
out substantial portions of crops in both 1994 and 1995 The tourism
sector has considerable potential for development over the next
decade

Sao Tome and PrincipeEconomy

Economyoverview This small poor island economy has become
increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence over 20 years ago
However cocoa production has substantially declined because of
drought and mismanagement The resulting shortage of cocoa for export
has created a persistent balanceofpayments problem Sao Tome has to
import all fuels most manufactured goods consumer goods and a
significant amount of food Over the years it has been unable to
service its external debt and has had to depend on concessional aid
and debt rescheduling Considerable potential exists for development
of a tourist industry and the government has taken steps to expand
facilities in recent years The government also has attempted to
reduce price controls and subsidies but economic growth has remained
sluggish Sao Tome is also optimistic that significant petroleum
discoveries are forthcoming in its territorial waters in the oilrich
waters of the Gulf of Guinea

world 26 of the proved total ranks as the largest exporter of
petroleum and plays a leading role in OPEC For the 1990s the
government intends to bring its budget which has been in deficit
since 1983 back into balance and to encourage private economic
activity Roughly 4 million foreign workers play an important role in
the Saudi economy for example in the oil and service sectors Helped
by production above its OPEC quota Saudi Arabia continued to bring
its finances closer into balance in 1997 recording a 16 billion
budget deficit and a 200 million current account surplus For 1998
the country looks to its policies of maintaining moderate fiscal
reforms restraining public spending and encouraging nonoil exports
Shortages of water and rapid population growth will constrain
government efforts to increase selfsufficiency in agricultural

subsidies have been steadily dismantled After seeing its economy

Serbia and MontenegroEconomy

Economyoverview The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in
1991 has been followed by highly destructive warfare the
destabilization of republic boundaries and the breakup of important
interrepublic trade flows Output in Serbia and Montenegro dropped by
half in 199293 Like the other former Yugoslav republics it had
depended on its sister republics for large amounts of energy and
manufactures Wide differences in climate mineral resources and
levels of technology among the republics accentuated this
interdependence as did the communist practice of concentrating much
industrial output in a small number of giant plants The breakup of
many of the trade links the sharp drop in output as industrial plants
lost suppliers and markets and the destruction of physical assets in
the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the
republics One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia is
the continuation in office of a communist government that is primarily
interested in political and military mastery not economic reform
Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a new currency unit in
June 1993 prices have been relatively stable since 1995 Reliable
statistics continue to be hard to come by and the GDP estimate is
extremely rough The economic boom anticipated by the government after
the suspension of UN sanctions in December 1995 has failed to
materialize Until the government cooperates on such matters as human
rights and war criminals it will lack full support from international
financial institutions

SeychellesEconomy

Economyoverview Since independence in 1976 per capita output in
this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the
old nearsubsistence level Growth has been led by the tourist sector
which employs about 30 of the labor force and provides more than 70
of hard currency earnings and by tuna fishing which accounted for
70 of GDP in 199697 In recent years the government has encouraged
foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services At
the same time the government has moved to reduce the dependence on
tourism by promoting the development of farming fishing and
smallscale manufacturing The vulnerability of the tourist sector was
illustrated by the sharp drop in 199192 due largely to the Gulf war
Although the industry has rebounded the government recognizes the
continuing need for upgrading the sector in the face of stiff
international competition

Introduction

Current issues On 25 May 1997 the democraticallyelected government
of President Ahmad Tejan KABBAH was overthrown by disgruntled army
personnel under the command of Major Johnny Paul KOROMA President
KABBAH fled to exile in Guinea The Economic Community of West African
States CeaseFire Monitoring Group ECOMOG forces led by a strong
Nigerian contingent undertook the suppression of the rebellion They
were initially unsuccessful but by October 1997 they forced the
rebels to agree to a ceasefire and to a plan to return the government
to democratic control by 22 April 1998 However the agreed
demobilization of the combatants was not carried out by the rebel
junta On 5 February 1998 hostilities broke out in the outskirts of
Freetown and ECOMOG mounted a major offensive completely routing the
rebels President KABBAH returned to office on 10 March to face the
task of restoring order to a demoralized population and a disorganized
and severely damaged economy

Sierra LeoneEconomy

Economyoverview Sierra Leone has substantial mineral agricultural
and fishery resources However the economic and social infrastructure
is not well developed and serious social disorders continue to hamper
economic development The seizure of power by the new Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council AFRC in May 1997 led to UN sanctions and a
sharp drop in GDP About twothirds of the workingage population
engages in subsistence agriculture Manufacturing consists mainly of
the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the
domestic market Bauxite and rutile mines have been shut down by civil
strife The major source of hard currency is found in the mining of
diamonds the large majority of which are smuggled out of the country

SingaporeEconomy

Economyoverview Singapore has an open economy with strong service
and manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links
derived from its entrepot history Extraordinarily strong fundamentals
allowed Singapore to weather the effects of the Asian financial crisis
better than its neighbors but the crisis did pull GDP growth down to
approximately 6 in 1997 Projections for 1998 GDP growth are in the
45 to 65 range Rising labor costs and appreciation of the
Singapore dollar against its neighbors currencies continue to be a
threat to Singapores competitiveness The governments strategy to
address this problem includes increasing productivity improving
infrastructure and encouraging higher valueadded industries In
applied technology per capita output investment and labor
discipline Singapore has key attributes of a developed country

SlovakiaEconomy

Economyoverview Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic on 1
January 1993 Slovakia has continued the difficult transformation from
a centrally controlled economy to a modern marketoriented economy
Macroeconomic performance improved steadily in 199496 but
privatization progressed only in fits and starts Strong export
performance boosted GDP growth to 49 in 1994 after a fouryear
decline GDP then rose by 68 in 1995 7 in 1996 and 59 in 1997
rates among the highest in Central and Eastern Europe Inflation
dropped from 26 in 1993 to 6 annually in 199697 the lowest rate in
the region Private activity now makes up more than twothirds of GDP
Although Slovak economic performance continues to be impressive many
warning signs of possible danger ahead have been raised Aggregate
demand has surged in the form of increased personal and government
consumption At the same time that the budget deficit is growing the
money supply has been rapidly increasing which could apply upward
pressure on inflation The trade and current account deficits both are
mounting as imports soar and exports sag Perhaps most troubling
Slovakia continues to have difficulty attracting foreign investment
because of perceived political problems and halting progress on
restructuring and privatization Continuing economic recovery in
western Europe should boost exports and production but Slovakias
position with foreign creditors and investors could suffer setbacks in
1998 if progress on privatization and restructuring stalls and if
domestic political problems continue to tarnish its international
image

estimates of Somalias population in mid1996 on the order of 60
million to 65 million have been made by aid and relief agencies
based on the number of persons being fed population counting in
Somalia is complicated by the large numbers of nomads and by refugee

Governmentnote While chaos and clan fighting continue in most of
Somalia some orderly government has been established in the northern
part In May 1991 the elders of clans in former British Somaliland
established the independent Republic of Somaliland which although
not recognized by any government maintains a stable existence aided
by the overwhelming dominance of the ruling clan and the economic
infrastructure left behind by British Russian and American military
assistance programs The economy has been growing and in February 1996
the EU agreed to finance the reconstruction of the port of Berbera
since then other aid projects have been assumed by the EU and by a
nongovernmental Italian organization

SomaliaEconomy

Economyoverview One of the worlds poorest and least developed
countries Somalia has few resources Moreover much of the economy
has been devastated by the civil war Agriculture is the most
important sector with livestock accounting for about 40 of GDP and
about 65 of export earnings Nomads and seminomads who are
dependent upon livestock for their livelihood make up a large portion
of the population Crop production generates only 10 of GDP and
employs about 20 of the work force After livestock bananas are the
principal export sugar sorghum corn and fish are products for the
domestic market The small industrial sector based on the processing
of agricultural products accounts for less than 10 of GDP most
facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife Moreover
ongoing civil disturbances in Mogadishu and outlying areas are
interfering with any substantial economic advance

ranks among the 10 largest in the world and a modern infrastructure
supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centers
throughout the region Growth has been positive since the historic
election of President Nelson MANDELA in the countrys first
multiracial elections in 1994 but not strong enough to cut into the
substantial unemployment Daunting economic problems remain from the
apartheid era especially the problems of poverty and economic
empowerment among the blacks Other problems are crime and corruption

introduction of tax incentives to stimulate new investment in
laborintensive projects expansion of basic infrastructure services

SpainEconomy

Economyoverview Spains mixed capitalist economy supports a GDP that
on a per capita basis is threefourths that of the four leading West
European economies Its centerright government has staked much on
gaining admission to the first group of countries to implement the
European single currency and based on economic indicators Madrid
appears poised to be in EMU from the outset The deficittoGDP ratio
is 23 the debttoGDP ratio is expected to be around 68 and
inflation is approximately 2 Moreover the AZNAR administration has
continued to advocate liberalization privatization and deregulation
of the economy and has introduced some tax reforms to that end
Unemployment nonetheless remains the highest in the EU at 21 The
government for political reasons has made only limited progress in
changing labor laws or reforming pension schemes which are key to the
sustainability of both Spains internal economic advances and its
competitiveness in a single currency area

Sri LankaEconomy

Economyoverview At independence in 1948 plantations growing tea
rubber or coconuts and paddies growing rice for subsistence dominated
Sri Lankas economy and as late as 1970 plantation crops accounted
for 93 of exports In 1977 Colombo abandoned statist economic
policies and its import substitution trade policy for marketoriented
policies and exportoriented trade Sri Lankas most dynamic
industries now are food processing textiles and apparel food and
beverages telecommunications and insurance and banking By 1996
plantation crops made up only 20 of exports while textiles and
garments accounted for 63 GDP grew at an annual average rate of 55
throughout the 1990s until a drought and a deteriorating security
situation lowered growth to 38 in 1996 The economy rebounded in
second half 1996 however and continued to perform well in 1997 with
growth of 6 Sustained economic growth coupled with population
growth of only 11 has pushed Sri Lanka from the ranks of the
poorest countries in the world up to the threshold of the middle
income countries For the next round of reforms the central bank of
Sri Lanka recommends that Colombo expand market mechanisms in
nonplantation agriculture dismantle the governments monopoly on
wheat imports and promote more competition in the financial sector A
continuing cloud over the economy is the fighting between the
Sinhalese and the minority Tamils which has cost 50000 lives in the
past 14 years

step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its nonpayment of
arrearages to the Fund After Sudan backtracked on promised reforms in
199293 the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund To avoid
expulsion Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears to the
Fund liberalize exchange rates and reduce subsidies measures it has
partially implemented The governments continued prosecution of the
civil war and its growing international isolation continued to inhibit
growth in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during 1997
Hyperinflation has raised consumer prices above the reach of most In
1997 a top priority was to develop potentially lucrative oilfields in
southcentral Sudan the government was seeking foreign partners to
exploit the oil sector

SurinameEconomy

Economyoverview The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry
which accounts for more than 15 of GDP and 70 of export earnings
Following a dismal year in 1994which saw the value of the Surinamese
guilder plummet by about 70 inflation rise to more than 600 and
national output fall for the fifth consecutive yearnearly all
economic indicators improved in 199597 The VENETIAAN government
unified the exchange rate as part of its structural adjustment program
SAP After assuming power in the fall of 1996 the WIJDENBOSCH
government ended the SAP claiming it was unfair to the poorer elements
of society Tax revenues fell as old taxes lapsed and the government
failed to implement new tax alternatives By the end of 1997 the
allocation of new Dutch development funds was frozen as Surinamese
government relations with Holland deteriorated Surinames economic
prospects for the medium term will depend on renewed commitment to
financially responsible monetary and fiscal policies

SwazilandEconomy

Economyoverview In this small landlocked economy subsistence
agriculture occupies more than 60 of the population Manufacturing
features a number of agroprocessing factories Mining has declined in
importance in recent years highgrade iron ore deposits were depleted
by 1978 and health concerns have cut world demand for asbestos
Exports of soft drink concentrate sugar and wood pulp are the main
earners of hard currency Surrounded by South Africa except for a
short border with Mozambique Swaziland is heavily dependent on South
Africa from which it receives nearly 90 of its imports and to which
it sends more than half of its exports Remittances from Swazi workers
in South African mines supplement domestically earned income by as
much as 20 The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for
foreign investment Overgrazing soil depletion and drought persist
as problems for the future

SwedenEconomy

Economyoverview Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole
twentieth century Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living
under a mixed system of hightech capitalism and extensive welfare
benefits It has a modern distribution system excellent internal and
external communications and a skilled labor force Timber
hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy
heavily oriented toward foreign trade Privately owned firms account
for about 90 of industrial output of which the engineering sector
accounts for 50 of output and exports Agriculture accounts for only
2 of GDP and 2 of the jobs In recent years however this
extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by budgetary
difficulties inflation high unemployment and a gradual loss of
competitiveness in international markets To curb the budget deficit
and bolster confidence in the economy the government adopted an
adjustment program in November 1994 that aims to eliminate the
government budget deficit and to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio
Sweden has harmonized its economic policies with those of the EU
which it joined at the start of 1995 Sweden has decided not to join
the EMU European Monetary Union Annual GDP growth should edge up to
25 in 199899

SwitzerlandEconomy

Economyoverview Switzerland a fundamentally prosperous and stable
modern economy with a per capita GDP roughly 10 above that of the big
West European economies is experiencing continued economic
difficulties GDP growth was a minus 02 in 1996 and a weak plus 04
in 1997 Weak domestic consumer demand is partly at fault stagnating
real disposable income combines with a reluctance to reduce saving
rates in the face of an uncertain employment outlook Switzerlands
leading sectors including financial services biotechnology
pharmaceuticals and specialpurpose machines therefore are more
reliant on export markets Exports should lead an upturn in Swiss
economic performance in 199899 provided the franc does not
appreciate substantially as a result of Swiss monetary policy or
instability in the run up to EMU

SyriaEconomy

Economyoverview Syrias predominantly statist economy is on a shaky
footing because of Damascuss failure to implement extensive economic
reform The dominant agricultural sector remains underdeveloped with
roughly 80 of agricultural land still dependent on rainfed sources
Although Syria has sufficient water supplies in the aggregate at
normal levels of precipitation the great distance between major water
supplies and population centers poses serious distribution problems
The water problem is exacerbated by rapid population growth
industrial expansion and increased water pollution Private
investment is critical to the modernization of the agricultural
energy and export sectors Oil production is leveling off and the
efforts of the nonoil sector to penetrate international markets have
fallen short Syrias inadequate infrastructure outmoded
technological base and weak educational system make it vulnerable to
future shocks and hamper competition with neighbors such as Jordan and
Israel

and currency markets While the economy remains sound the government
forecasts 6 GDP growth for 1998 the New Taiwan Dollar depreciated
20 in 1997 Real growth in GDP has averaged about 85 a year during
the past three decades Export growth has been even faster and has
provided the impetus for industrialization Inflation and unemployment

TajikistanEconomy

Economyoverview Tajikistan has the lowest per capita GDP among the
former Soviet republics Agriculture dominates the economy with
cotton the most important crop Mineral resources varied but limited
in amount include silver gold uranium and tungsten Industry is
limited to a large aluminum plant hydropower facilities and small
obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing The
Tajik economy has been gravely weakened by four years of civil
conflict and by the loss of subsidies from Moscow and of markets for
its products Tajikistan thus depends on aid from Russia and
Uzbekistan and on international humanitarian assistance for much of
its basic subsistence needs Even if the peace agreement of June 1997
is honored the country faces major problems in integrating refugees
and former combatants into the economy Moreover constant political
turmoil and the continued dominance by former communist officials have
impeded the introduction of meaningful economic reforms

force Topography and climatic conditions however limit cultivated
crops to only 4 of the land area Industry accounts for 17 of GDP
and is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light
consumer goods The economic recovery program announced in mid1986
has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
financial support for the program by bilateral donors The World Bank
the International Monetary Fund and bilateral donors have provided
funds to rehabilitate Tanzanias deteriorated economic infrastructure
Growth in 199197 has featured a pickup in industrial production and a
substantial increase in output of minerals led by gold Natural gas

ThailandEconomy

Economyoverview In 199798 the Thai economy is in a deep recession
as a result of the severe financial problems facing many Thai firms
particularly banks and finance companies In the early 1990s Thailand
liberalized financial inflows banks and other firms borrowed in
dollars and did not hedge their positions because there was no
perceived exchange rate risk These funds financed a property boom
that began to taper off in the mid1990s In addition export growth 
previously a key driver of the Thai economycollapsed in 1996
resulting in growing doubts that the Bank of Thailand could maintain
the bahts peg to the dollar The Bank mounted an expensive defense of
the exchange rate that nearly depleted foreign exchange reserves then
decided to float the exchange rate triggering a sharp increase in
foreign liabilities that cashstrapped Thai firms were already having
trouble repaying In August 1997 the government headed by Prime
Minister CHAWALIT signed an agreement with the IMF for access to a 14
billion facility to supplement foreign exchange reserves and restore
financial market stability CHAWALIT resigned in November 1997
however under pressure for lacking a coherent approach to managing
the IMF program and the financial crisis Democratic Party leader
CHUAN Likphai formed a sevenparty coalition government and closely
adhered to the IMF program tentatively reestablishing financial
stability by February 1998 An economic turnaround requires
rescheduling the large shortterm foreign liabilities of Thai firms
restoring high rates of export growth to finance foreign liabilities
and extensively recapitalizing the banking system

TogoEconomy

Economyoverview This small subSaharan economy is heavily dependent
on both commercial and subsistence agriculture which provides
employment for more than 60 of the labor force Cocoa coffee and
cotton together generate about 30 of export earnings Togo is
selfsufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal with
occasional regional supply difficulties In the industrial sector
phosphate mining is by far the most important activity although it
has suffered from the collapse of world phosphate prices and increased
foreign competition Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade
center The governments decadelong effort supported by the World
Bank and the IMF to implement economic reform measures encourage
foreign investment and bring revenues in line with expenditures has
stalled Political unrest including private and public sector strikes
throughout 1992 and 1993 has jeopardized the reform program shrunk
the tax base and disrupted vital economic activity The 12 January
1994 devaluation of the currency by 50 provided an important impetus
to renewed structural adjustment these efforts were facilitated by
the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm The
1998 presidential elections provide an important opportunity for
Togos evolving political system to demonstrate that the country can
participate in a peaceful and effective manner with World Bank and IMF
programs Progress depends on continuing privatization increased
transparency in government accounting to accommodate increased social
service outlays and possible downsizing of the military on which the
regime has depended to stay in place

TurkeyEconomy

Economyoverview Turkeys dynamic economy is a complex mix of modern
industry and commerce along with traditional village agriculture and
crafts It has a strong and rapidly growing private sector yet the
state still plays a major role in basic industry banking transport
and communication Its most important industryand the largest source
of exportsis textiles and clothing which is almost entirely in
private hands The current economic situation is marked by strong
growth coupled with serious imbalances Real GDP expanded by about 7
in 1997 but inflation rose to 99 at yearend and the public sector
fiscal deficit probably remained near 10 of GDP To some extent
Ankara is caught in a vicious fiscal circle because about half of all
central government revenue is going to pay interest on the national
debt The government that took office in July 1997headed by Prime
Minister YILMAZs Motherland Partyenacted a 1998 budget that includes
substantial tax increases and cuts in noninterest spending but these
gains will be offset by a jump in interest payments The government
also is planning to overhaul the social welfare and tax systems and to
speed up privatization although these reforms will face tough
political opposition Ankara is trying to increase trade with other
countries in the region but most of Turkeys trade is still with OECD
countries Despite the implementation in January 1996 of customs union
with the EU foreign direct investment in the country remains
lowabout 05 billion annuallyperhaps because potential investors
are concerned about high inflation and the unsettled political
situation Economic growth will slow in 1998 to perhaps 4 and
inflation should decline although the governments 50 target appears
overoptimistic The current account deficit probably will remain
small1 to 15 of GDP  when Turkeys unrecorded suitcase exports
are included

TurkmenistanEconomy

Economyoverview Turkmenistan is largely desert country with nomadic
cattle raising intensive agriculture in irrigated oases and huge gas
and oil resources Onehalf of its irrigated land is planted in
cotton making it the worlds tenth largest producer It also
possesses the worlds fifth largest reserves of natural gas and
substantial oil resources Until the end of 1993 Turkmenistan had
experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states
because its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and
gas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings In 1994 Russias
refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and mounting
debts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas deliveries
contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and caused the
budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit The economy
bottomed out in 1996 but high inflation continued Furthermore with
an authoritarian excommunist regime in power and a tribally based
social structure Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to
economic reform hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its
inefficient economy In 1996 the government set in place a
stabilization program aimed at a unified and marketbased exchange
rate allocation of government credits by auction and strict limits
on budget deficits Privatization goals remain limited Turkmenistan
is working hard to open new gas export channels through Iran and
Turkey to Europe but these will take many years to realize

TuvaluEconomy

Economyoverview Tuvalu consists of a densely populated scattered
group of nine coral atolls with poor soil The country has no known
mineral resources and few exports Subsistence farming and fishing are
the primary economic activities The islands are too small and too
remote for development of a largescale tourist industry Government
revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
remittances About 1000 Tuvaluans work in Nauru in the phosphate
mining industry Nauru has begun repatriating Tuvaluans however as
phosphate resources decline which will present additional problems
for Tuvalus already stretched economy Substantial income is received
annually from an international trust fund established in 1987 by
Australia NZ and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea
In an effort to reduce its dependence on foreign aid the government
is pursuing public sector reforms including privatization of some
government functions and personnel cuts of up to 7 Lowlying Tuvalu
is particularly vulnerable to any future global warming

UkraineEconomy

Economyoverview After Russia the Ukrainian republic was far and
away the most important economic component of the former Soviet Union
producing about four times the output of the nextranking republic
Its fertile black soil generated more than onefourth of Soviet
agricultural output and its farms provided substantial quantities of
meat milk grain and vegetables to other republics Likewise its
diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to
industrial and mining sites in other regions of the former USSR
Ukraine depends on imports of energy especially natural gas Shortly
after the implosion of the USSR in December 1991 the Ukrainian
Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for
privatization but widespread resistance to reform within the
government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to
some backtracking Output in 199297 fell to less than half the 1991
level Loose monetary policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary
levels in late 1993 Since his election in July 1994 President KUCHMA
has pushed economic reforms maintained financial discipline and
tried to remove almost all remaining controls over prices and foreign
trade Implementation of KUCHMAs economic agenda is encountering
considerable resistance from parliament entrenched bureaucrats and
industrial interests and an environment of corruption continues to
discourage foreign investors One signal achievement has been the
reduction of the inflation rate to 10 by yearend 1997 If KUCHMA
succeeds in implementing aggressive market reforms during 1998 the
economy should reverse its downward trend with real growth occurring
by late 1998 and into 1999

highest per capita incomes and with a sizable annual trade surplus
Its wealth is based on oil and gas output about 33 of GDP and the
fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of those
commodities Since 1973 the UAE has undergone a profound
transformation from an impoverished region of small desert
principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living At
present levels of production oil and gas reserves should last for
over 100 years The UAE Government is encouraging increased

United KingdomEconomy

Economyoverview The UK is one of the worlds great trading powers
and financial centers and its essentially capitalistic economy ranks
among the four largest in Western Europe Over the past two decades
the government has greatly reduced public ownership and contained the
growth of social welfare programs Agriculture is intensive highly
mechanized and efficient by European standards producing about 60
of food needs with only about 1 of the labor force The UK has large
coal natural gas and oil reserves primary energy production
accounts for 12 of GDP one of the highest shares of any industrial
nation Services particularly banking insurance and business
services account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while
industry continues to decline in importance now employing only 18 of
the work force Exports and manufacturing output have been the primary
engines of growth Unemployment is gradually falling Inflation is a
moderate 31 A major economic policy question for the UK in the late
1990s is the terms on which it participates in the financial and
economic integration of Europe

United StatesEconomy

Economyoverview The US has the most powerful diverse and
technologically advanced economy in the world with a per capita GDP
of 30200 the largest among major industrial nations In this
marketoriented economy private individuals and business firms make
most of the decisions and government buys needed goods and services
predominantly in the private marketplace US business firms enjoy
considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western
Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant lay off surplus
workers and develop new products At the same time they face higher
barriers to entry in their rivals home markets than the barriers to
entry of foreign firms in US markets In all economic sectors US
firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances
especially in computers and in medical aerospace and military
equipment although their advantage has narrowed since the end of
World War II The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual
development of a twotier labor market in which those at the bottom
lack the education and the professionaltechnical skills of those at
the top and more and more fail to get pay raises health insurance
coverage and other benefits The years 199497 witnessed moderate
gains in real output low inflation rates and a drop in unemployment
below 6 Longterm problems include inadequate investment in economic
infrastructure rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population
sizable trade deficits and stagnation of family income in the lower
economic groups The outlook for 1998 is for continued moderate
growth low inflation and about the same level of unemployment Two
shadows for 1998 are the severe financial crises in East Asia and the
exuberant level of stock prices in relation to corporate earnings

UzbekistanEconomy

Economyoverview Uzbekistan is a dry landlocked country of which 10
consists of intensely cultivated irrigated river valleys It was one
of the poorest areas of the former Soviet Union with more than 60 of
its population living in densely populated rural communities
Uzbekistan is now the worlds third largest cotton exporter a major
producer of gold and natural gas and a regionally significant
producer of chemicals and machinery Following independence in
December 1991 the government sought to prop up its Sovietstyle
command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and
prices Faced with high rates of inflation however the government
began to reform in mid1994 by introducing tighter monetary policies
expanding privatization slightly reducing the role of the state in
the economy and improving the environment for foreign investors
Nevertheless the state continues to be a dominating influence in the
economy and reforms have so far failed to bring about muchneeded
structural changes The IMF suspended Uzbekistans 185 million
standby arrangement in late 1996 because of governmental steps that
made impossible fulfillment of Fund conditions

Economyoverview The economy is based primarily on subsistence or
smallscale agriculture which provides a living for 65 of the
population Fishing offshore financial services and tourism with
46000 visitors in 1996 are other mainstays of the economy Mineral
deposits are negligible the country has no known petroleum deposits
A small light industry sector caters to the local market Tax revenues
come mainly from import duties Economic development is hindered by
dependence on relatively few commodity exports vulnerability to
natural disasters and long distances from main markets and between

VenezuelaEconomy

Economyoverview The petroleum sector dominates the economy
accounting for 27 of GDP 78 of export earnings and more than half
of government operating revenues It is likely to become even more
important as the state petroleum company plans to double its
production over the next 10 years Realizing the failure of
interventionist policies the CALDERA administration embarked on a
comprehensive economic reform program which included negotiation of a
standby agreement with the IMF in 1996 elimination of price and
exchange controls and revitalization of Venezuelas stalled
privatization program The influx of foreign capital and the currency
depreciation that followed exchange liberalization led to 103
inflation in 1996 the highest in Venezuelan history The government
stepped in toward the end of 1996 propping up the Bolivar by using a
stable nominal exchange rate as a restraint on inflationwhich fell in
1997 to 38 The macroeconomic adjustments bolstered by strong oil
prices resulted in strong growth in 1997 However the East Asian
financial crisis and the decline of international oil prices toward
the end of 1997 brought pressure on the currency which Caracas was
able to stave off Caracas readjusted its exchange rate bands and
began to allow quicker depreciation of the Bolivar the government
also tightened monetary policy Concerned over potential revenue
shortfalls from soft oil prices for the 1998 budget Caracas has
implemented budget cuts to compensate for previously optimistic oil
revenue estimates The government also has pushed ahead with sale of
the stateowned steel company and the strategic aluminum sector
thereby reassuring domestic and international investors of Venezuelas
commitment to reform The monetary and fiscal measures have been well
received by the international financial community As a result
financial analysts believe the economy will still grow at a healthy
pace in 1998 though they have lowered their initial projections for
GDP growth due to the soft oil market

VietnamEconomy

Economyoverview Vietnam is a poor densely populated country that
has had to recover from the ravages of war the loss of financial
support from the old Soviet Bloc and the rigidities of a centrally
planned economy Substantial progress has been achieved over the past
10 years in moving forward from an extremely low starting point
Economic growth continued at a strong pace during 1997 with industrial
output rising by 12 and real GDP expanding by 85 These positive
numbers however masked some major difficulties that are emerging in
economic performance Many domestic industries including coal
cement steel and paper reported large stockpiles of inventory and
tough competition from more efficient foreign producers giving
Vietnam a trade deficit of 33 billion in 1997 While disbursements
of aid and foreign direct investment have risen they are not large
enough to finance the rapid increase in imports and it is widely
believed that Vietnam may be using shortterm trade credits to bridge
the gapa risky strategy that could result in a foreign exchange
crunch Meanwhile Vietnamese authorities continue to move slowly
toward implementing the structural reforms needed to revitalize the
economy and produce more competitive exportdriven industries
Privatization of state enterprises remains bogged down in political
controversy while the countrys dynamic private sector is denied both
financing and access to markets Reform of the banking sector is
proceeding slowly raising concerns that the country will be unable to
tap sufficient domestic savings to maintain current high levels of
growth Administrative and legal barriers are also causing costly
delays for foreign investors and are raising similar doubts about
Vietnams ability to maintain the inflow of foreign capital
Ideological bias in favor of state intervention and control of the
economy is slowing progress toward a more liberalized investment

SelfGovernment Arrangements the DOP signed in Washington on 13
September 1993 provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim selfgovernment in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May 1996 but have
not resumed since the initial meeting Under the DOP Israel agreed to
transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian
Authority which includes a Palestinian Legislative Council elected in
January 1996 as part of interim selfgoverning arrangements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip A transfer of powers and responsibilities
for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the IsraelPLO 4
May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in
additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the IsraelPLO 28
September 1995 Interim Agreement and the IsraelPLO 15 January 1997

West BankEconomy

Economyoverview Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered
by tight Israeli security restrictions Industries using advanced
technology or requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by a
lack of local capital and Israeli policies that block the movement of
goods and people Capital investment consists largely of residential
housing not productive assets that would enable local Palestinian
firms to compete with Israeli industry GDP has been substantially
supplemented by workers who commute to jobs in Israel Worker
remittances from the Persian Gulf states dropped after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in August 1990 In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis many
Palestinians have returned to the West Bank increasing unemployment
and export revenues have dropped because of the decline of markets in
Jordan and the Gulf states An estimated 147000 people were in
refugee camps in 1996

Economyoverview Real global outputgross world product GWProse an
estimated 40 in 1997 And once more results varied widely among
regions and countries With its solid 38 growth the US again
accounted for 21 of GWP in 1997 Western Europe grew at 25 not
enough to cut into its high unemployment and accounted for another
21 of GWP Japans faltering economy grew at only 09 with its share
of GWP at 8 The advanced countries as a whole accounted for an
estimated 53 of GWP with overall growth at 30 The 15 former
Soviet republics and the countries of Eastern Europe posted growth of
18 reversing the long downturn that followed the collapse of
communism Growth varied widely among these countries eg Ukraine
at a negative 32 Russia at a positive 04 and the Baltic
countries at a strong 7 The area as a whole accounted for 5 of
global output China and India with a combined population of 22
billion or 37 of the world total grew at 88 and 5 respectively
Chinas official GDP statistics probably are overstated The
developing countries as a whole contributed 42 to GWP with an overall
growth rate of 57 Externally the nationstate as a bedrock
economicpolitical institution is steadily losing control over
international flows of people goods funds and technology
Internally the central government in a number of cases is losing
control over resources as separatist regional movementstypically
based on ethnicity  gain momentum eg in the successor states of
the former Soviet Union in the former Yugoslavia in India and in
Canada In Western Europe governments face the difficult political
problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to
increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment The
addition of more than 80 million people each year to an already
overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution
desertification underemployment epidemics and famine Because of
their own internal problems the industrialized countries have
inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the
world which at least from the economic point of view are becoming
further marginalized Toward the end of 1997 and on into 1998 serious
financial difficulties in several highgrowth East Asia countries cast
a shadow over shortterm global economic prospects The introduction
of the euro as the common currency of much of Western Europe in
January 1999 will pose serious economic risks because of varying
levels of income and cultural and political differences among the
participating nations For specific economic developments in each

YemenEconomy

Economyoverview The northern city Sanaa is the political capital of
a united Yemen and the southern city Aden with its refinery and port
facilities is the economic and commercial capital Future economic
development depends heavily on the attraction of foreign investment to
diversify the economy Former South Yemens willingness to merge
stemmed partly from the sharp decline in Soviet economic support The
low level of domestic industry and agriculture has made northern Yemen
dependent on imports for practically all of its essential needs Once
selfsufficient in food production northern Yemen has become a major
importer Land once used for export cropscotton fruit and
vegetables  has been turned over to growing a shrub called qat whose
leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect by Yemenis and which has
no significant export market Economic growth in former South Yemen
has been constrained by a lack of incentives partly stemming from
centralized control over production decisions investment allocation
and import choices Yemens GDP has been supplemented by remittances
from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign aid Since the Gulf crisis
however remittances have dropped substantially Floods in June 1996
caused the loss of much valuable topsoil in the agricultural sector
increasing the need for imports of foodstuffs Oil production and GDP
as a whole are expected to increase moderately in 1998

ZimbabweEconomy

Economyoverview Agriculture employs 27 of the labor force of this
landlocked nation and supplies almost 25 of exports Mining accounts
for only 5 of both GDP and employment but minerals and metals
account for about 20 of exports The government is working to
consolidate earlier progress in developing a marketoriented economy
Although the IMF suspended support for Zimbabwes economic structural
adjustment program ESAP in 1995 due to government failure to meet
key targets recent talks between the government and the Fund have
held hope for renewed support if Zimbabwe remains committed to
budgetary targets A key element of the budget is the Zimbabwe Program
for SocioEconomic Transformation ZIMPREST the second phase of
ESAP whose goals include increased commercialization and
privatization of governmentowned enterprises and more
outwardlooking trade and investment policies The World Bank
resumed balance of payments support to Zimbabwe in early 1998
Government officials face the difficult task of restraining
expenditures in their effort to keep inflation within bounds

GDP This entry gives the gross domestic product GDP or value of all
final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year GDP
dollar estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power
parity PPP calculations See the note on GDP methodology for more
information

GDP methodology In the Economy section GDP dollar estimates for all
countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations
rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates The
PPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price
weights which are applied to the quantities of final goods and
services produced in a given economy The data derived from the PPP
method provide a better comparison of economic wellbeing between
countries The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the
corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate
When converted at PPP rates 1000 will buy the same market basket of
goods in any country Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are
quite reliable PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough
approximations Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation
of PPP numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program
UNICP and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the
University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues In contrast currency
exchange rates depend on a variety of international and domestic
financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output
In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate
estimate of GDP in dollars is typically onefourth to onehalf the PPP
estimate Furthermore exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by
10 or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real
output has remained unchanged On 12 January 1994 for example the 14
countries of the African Financial Community whose currencies are
tied to the French franc devalued their currencies by 50 This move
of course did not cut the real output of these countries by half One
important caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a
percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially
from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms as
for example when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of
Russian or Japanese military expenditures
Note the numbers for GDP and other economic data can not be chained
together from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes in
the US dollar measuring rod revisions of data by statistical
agencies use of new or different sources of information and changes
in national statistical methods and practices For statistical series

Life expectancy at birth This entry contains the average number of
years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year if
mortality at each age remains constant in the future The entry
includes total population as well as the male and female components

are no universal definitions and standards of literacy Unless
otherwise specified all rates are based on the most common
definitionthe ability to read and write at a specified age Detailing
the standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to
read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook Information on

impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly
changing technologydriven world

being extended the full distance

Merchant marine Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged
in the carriage of goods all commercial vessels as opposed to all
nonmilitary ships which excludes tugs fishing vessels offshore oil
rigs etc or a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or
register This entry contains information in two subfieldstotal and
ships by type Total includes the total number of ships 1000 GRT or
over total DWT for those ships and total GRT for those ships Ships

A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a
territory possession or colony primarily or exclusively for the use
of ships owned in the parent country it is also referred to as an
offshore register the offshore equivalent of an internal register
Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent
country or a local variant of it but will be subject to the maritime
laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory Although the nature
of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in
the parent country just as in the internal register the ships may
also be owned abroad The captive register then acts as a flag of
convenience register except that it is not the register of an
independent state
A flag of convenience register is a national register
offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state
The major flags of convenience FOC attract ships to their registers
by virtue of low fees low or nonexistent taxation of profits and
liberal manning requirements True FOC registers are characterized by
having relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the
flag state Thus while virtually any flag can be used for ships under
a given set of circumstances an FOC register is one where the
majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad It is also referred to
as an open register
A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and
which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at
home or abroad Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how
a ship is crewed and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be
placed on the register
An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of
a national register Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits use of foreign
nationals as crew members and usually ownership outside the flag
state when it functions as an FOC register The Norwegian
International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are
the most notable examples of an internal register Both have been
instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of
convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to the Norwegian and
Danish flags
A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against
payment of freight it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship
but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only
A register is the record of a ships ownership and
nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a country
also it is the compendium of such individual ships registrations
Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it
subject to the laws of the country in which registered the flag
state regardless of the nationality of the ships ultimate owner

Military This category includes the entries dealing with a countrys
military structure manpower and expenditures

Population growth rate The average annual percent change in the
population resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over
deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country The
rate may be positive or negative Also known as growth rate or average
annual rate of growth The growth rate is a factor in determining how
great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of
its people for infrastructure eg schools hospitals housing
roads resources eg food water electricity and jobs Rapid

countries are now attributed to sexselective abortion and infanticide
due to a strong preference for sons This will affect future marriage
patterns and fertility patterns Eventually it could cause unrest
among young adult males who are unable to find partners The sex ratio
at birth for the World is 106 1998 est

measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate since it
refers to births per woman This indicator shows the potential for
population growth in the country High rates will also place some
limits on the labor force participation rates for women Large numbers
of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might limit

Note The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia SFRY ceases to
exist None of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia
including Serbia and Montenegro have been permitted to participate
solely on the basis of the membership of the former Yugoslavia in the
United Nations General Assembly and Economic and Social Council and
their subsidiary bodies and in various United Nations specialized
agencies The United Nations however permits the seat and nameplate
of the SFRY to remain permits the SFRY mission to continue to
function and continues to fly the flag of the former Yugoslavia For
a variety of reasons a number of other organizations have not yet
taken action with regard to the membership of the former Yugoslavia
The World Factbook therefore continues to list Yugoslavia under
international organizations where the SFRY seat remains or where no
action has yet been taken

 _________________________________________________________________

Note At this time only three countriesBurma Liberia and the
UShave not adopted the International System of Units SI or metric
system as their official system of weights and measures Although use
of the metric system has been sanctioned by law in the US since 1866
it has been slow in displacing the American adaptation of the British
Imperial System known as the US Customary System The US is the only
industrialized nation that does not mainly use the metric system in
its commercial and standards activities but there is increasing
acceptance in science medicine government and many sectors of
industry

Standard No 4 Defense Intelligence Agency Manual 6518 December
1994 published by the Defense Intelligence Agency

The US Government has not yet adopted a standard for hydrographic
codes similar to the Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS
104 country codes The names and limits of the following oceans and
seas are not always directly comparable because of differences in the
customers needs and requirements of the individual organizations
Even the number of principal water bodies varies from organization to
organization Factbook users for example find the Atlantic Ocean and
Pacific Ocean entries useful but none of the following standards
include those oceans in their entirety Nor is there any provision for
combining codes or overcodes to aggregate water bodies

HISTORY OF THE WORLD FACTBOOK

 A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook
 _________________________________________________________________

The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is
acquired converted into intelligence and made available to
policymakers Information is raw data from any source data that may
be fragmentary contradictory unreliable ambiguous deceptive or
wrong Intelligence is information that has been collected
integrated evaluated analyzed and interpreted Finished
intelligence is the final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to
be delivered to the policymaker

The three types of finished intelligence are basic current and
estimative Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual
reference material on a country or issue Current intelligence reports
on new developments Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes
The three are mutually supportive basic intelligence is the
foundation on which the other two are constructed current
intelligence continually updates the inventory of knowledge and
estimative intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and
issue prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence The
World Factbook The Presidents Daily Brief and the National
Intelligence Estimates are examples of the three types of finished
intelligence

The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since
the days of George Washington but only since World War II have they
been coordinated on a governmentwide basis Three programs have
highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since
that time 1 the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies JANIS 2
the National Intelligence Survey NIS and 3 CIAs World Factbook

During World War II intelligence consumers realized that the
production of basic intelligence by different components of the US
Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting
information The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home
to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for
integrating departmental reports to national policymakers Detailed
coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as
Germany and Japan but also on places of little previous interest In
the Pacific Theater for example the Navy and Marines had to launch
amphibious operations against many islands about which information was
unconfirmed or nonexistent Intelligence authorities resolved that the
United States should never again be caught unprepared

In 1943 Gen George B Strong G2 Adm H C Train Office of
Naval IntelligenceONI and Gen William J Donovan Director of the
Office of Strategic ServicesOSS decided that a joint effort should
be initiated A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that
recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing
Board to assemble edit coordinate and publish the Joint Army Navy
Intelligence Studies JANIS JANIS was the first interdepartmental
basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government
for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic
intelligence Between April 1943 and July 1947 the board published 34
JANIS studies JANIS performed well in the war effort and numerous
letters of commendation were received including a statement from Adm
Forrest Sherman Chief of Staff Pacific Ocean Areas which said
JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shorebased
planners

The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar
world was well expressed in 1946 by George S Pettee a noted author
on national security He wrote in The Future of American Secret
Intelligence Infantry Journal Press 1946 page 46 that world
leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than
war The conduct of peace involves all countries all human
activitiesnot just the enemy and his war production

The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and
officially began operating on 18 September 1947 Effective 1 October
1947 the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational
responsibility for JANIS On 13 January 1948 the National Security
Council issued Intelligence Directive NSCID No 3 which authorized
the National Intelligence Survey NIS program as a peacetime
replacement for the wartime JANIS program Before adequate NIS country
sections could be produced government agencies had to develop more
comprehensive gazetteers and better maps The US Board on Geographic
Names BGN compiled the names the Department of the Interior
produced the gazetteers and CIA produced the maps

The Hoover Commissions Clark Committee set up in 1954 to study the
structure and administration of the CIA reported to Congress in 1955
that The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication
which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all
areas of the world    There will always be a continuing
requirement for keeping the Survey uptodate The Factbook was
created as an annual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS
studies The first classified Factbook was published in August 1962
and the first unclassified version was published in June 1971 The NIS
program was terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook map and
gazetteer components The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made
available to the public with sales through the US Government Printing
Office GPO The 1996 edition was the first to be printed by GPO The
year 1998 marks the 51st anniversary of the establishment of the
Central Intelligence Agency and the 55th year of continuous basic
intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and
its two predecessor programs
