CHAPTER I

THE FALLING BIPLANE

She sure is a fine boat Dick

And she can go some too

Glad you like her fellows replied Dick Hamilton to the remarks of
his chums Paul Drew and Innis Beeby as he turned the wheel of a new
motorboat and sent the craft about in a graceful sweep toward a small
dock which connected with a little excursion resort on the Kentfield
river

Like her Who could help it asked Paul looking about admiringly at
the fittings of the craft Why you could go on a regular cruise in
her

You might if you kept near your base of supplies remarked Dick

Base of supplies laughed Innis Cant you forget for a while
that youre at a military school old man and not give us the sort of
stuff we get in class all the while

Well what I meant explained the young millionaire owner of the
motorboat was that you couldnt carry enough food aboard and have
room to move about if you went on a very long trip

Thats right you couldnt agreed Paul And of late I seem to have
acquired the eating habit in its worst form

I never knew the time when you didnt have it responded Dick Im
going to give you a chance to indulge in it right now and Im going to
profit by your example

Whats doing asked Innis as he straightened the collar of his
military blouse for the three were in the fatigue uniforms of the
Kentfield Military Academy where Dick and his chums attended Lessons
and practice were over for the day and the young millionaire had
invited his friends out for a little trip in his new motorboat

I thought wed just stop at Bruces place and get a sandwich and a
cup of coffee suggested Dick Then we can go on down the river and
we wont have to be back until time for guardmount Well be better
able to stand it if we get a bite to eat

Right you are old chap exclaimed Paul and then he too began to
smooth the wrinkles out of his blouse and to ease his rather tight
trousers at the knees

Say whats the matter with you dudes anyhow asked Dick who after
glancing ahead to see that he was on the right course to the dock
looked back to give some attention to the motor

Matter I dont see anything the matter remarked Innis in casual
tones while he flicked some dust from his shoes with a spare pocket
handkerchief

Why you two are fussing as though you were a couple of girls at your
first dance declared Dick as he adjusted the valves of the oil cups
to supply a little more lubricant to the new motor which had not yet
warmed up to its work Innis acts as though he were sorry he hadnt
come out in his dress uniform and as for you Paul Im beginning to
think you are afraid you hadnt shaved Whats it all about anyhow
Old man Bruce wont care whether you have on one tan shoe and one black
one or whether your hair is parted or not

Then Dick having gotten the motor running to his satisfaction looked
toward the dock which he was rapidly nearing in his boat The next
moment he gave a whistle of surprise

Ah ha No wonder he cried The girls So thats why you fellows
were fixing up and getting yourselves to look pretty And you let me
monkey with the motor and get all grease and dirt while you Say I
guess well call off this eating stunt and he swung over the steering
wheel

Oh I say protested Innis

Dont be mean added Paul We havent seen the girls in some time
and theres three of em

Dick laughed On the dock under the shade of an awning he had caught
sight of three pretty girls from towngirls he and his chums knew
quite well They were Mabel Hanford in whom Dick was more than
ordinarily interested Grace Knox and Irene Martin

I thought Id get a rise out of you fellows the young millionaire
went on Trying to get me in bad were you

The boat swerved away from the dock The girls who had arisen
evidently to come down to the float and welcome the approaching
cadets seemed disappointed One of them had waved her handkerchief in
response to a salute from Paul

Here take some of this and clean your face suggested Paul handing
Dick some cotton waste from a seat locker

And heres a bit for your shoes added Innis performing a like
service Youll look as good as we do

What about my hands asked Dick Think I want to go up and sit
alongside of a girl with paws like these and he held out one that was
black and oily

Havent you any soap aboard asked Innis for he like Paul seemed
anxious that Dick should land them at the dock where the girls were

Oh well if you fellows are as anxious as all that I spose Ill have
to humor you agreed Dick with a grin I dare say Bruce can let me
wash up in his place and he turned the craft back on the course he
had previously been holding A little later the motorboat was made
fast to the float and the three cadets were greeting the three girls

Look out for my hands warned Dick as Miss Hanfords light summer
dress brushed near him Im all oil and grease Ill go scrub up if
youll excuse me

Certainly said Mabel Hanford with a rippling laugh

When Dick returned he ordered a little lunch served out on the end of
the dock where they could sit and enjoy the cool breezes and look at
the river on which were many pleasure craft

Where were you boys going asked Grace Knox as she toyed with her
icecream spoon

Coming to see you answered Paul promptly

As if wed believe that mocked Irene Why you were going right
past here and only turned in when you saw us

Dick didnt want to come at all said Innis

He didnt Why not demanded Mabel

Bashful I guess murmured Paul

No it was because I didnt want to inflict the company of these two
bores on you ladies exclaimed Dick thus getting back

There was much gay talk and laughter and as the afternoon was still
young Dick proposed taking the girls out for a little jaunt in his new
craft He had only recently purchased it and after using it at
Kentfield he intended taking it with him to a large lake where he and
his father expected to spend the Summer

Oh that was just fine cried Mabel when the ride was over and the
party was back at the pier Thank you so much Dick

Humph You have US to thanknot him declared Paul He wouldnt
have turned in here if we hadnt made him And just because his hands
had a little oil on

Say dont believe him protested the young millionaire I had
proposed coming here before I knew you girls were on the dock

Well we thank all THREE of you cried Irene with a bow that
included the trio of cadets

Salute exclaimed Paul and the young soldiers drew themselves up
stiffly and in the most approved manner taught at Kentfield brought
their hands to their heads

Bout face Forwardmarch cried Grace imitating an officers
orders and the boys with laughs stood at ease

See you at the Junior prom

Yes dont forget

And save me a couple of hesitation waltzes

Can you come for a ride tomorrow

Surely

This last was the answer of the girls to Dicks invitation and the
exclamations before that were the goodbyes between the girls and boys
reference being made to a coming dance of the Junior class

Then Dick and his chums entered the motorboat and started back for the
military academy

Youve got to go some to get back in time to let us tog up for
guardmount remarked Paul looking at his watch

Thats right added Innis I dont want to get a calldown Im
about up to my limit now

Well do it all right announced Dick I havent speeded the motor
yet Ive been warming it up Ill show you what she can do

He opened wider the gasoline throttle of the engine and advanced the
timer Instantly the boat shot ahead as the motor ran at twice the
number of revolutions

Thats something like cried Paul admiringly

She sure has got speed murmured Innis

On they sped talking of the girls of their plans for the summer and
the coming examinations

Hark Whats that suddenly asked Paul holding up his hand for
silence

They were made aware of a curious humming throbbing sound

Some speed boat ventured Dick

None in sight objected Paul with a glance up and down the river
which at this point ran in a straight stretch for two miles or more
You could see a boat if you could hear it as plainly as that

Its getting louder announced Innis

Indeed the sound was now more plainly to be heard

Paul gave a quick glance upward

Look fellows he exclaimed An airship

The sound was right over their heads now and as all three looked up
they saw soaring over them a large biplane containing three figures
It was low enough for the forms to be distinguished clearly

Some airship cried Dick admiringly

And making time too remarked Innis

Aircraft were no novelties to the cadets In fact part of the
instruction at Kentfield included wireless and the theoretical use of
aeroplanes in war The cadets had gone in a body to several aviation
meets and once had been taken by Major Franklin Webster the
instructor in military tactics to an army meet where several new forms
of biplanes and monoplanes had been tried out to see which should be
given official recognition

I never saw one like that before remarked Paul as they watched the
evolutions of the craft above them

Neither did I admitted Dick

Ive seen one something like that spoke Innis

Where his chums wanted to know as Dick slowed down his boat the
better to watch the biplane which was now circling over the river

Why a cousin of mine Whitfield Vardon by name has the airship craze
pretty bad resumed Innis He has an idea he can make one that will
maintain its equilibrium no matter how the wind blows or what happens
But poor fellow hes spent all his money on experiments and he hasnt
succeeded The last I heard he was about down and out poor chap He
showed me a model of his machine once and it looked a lot like this
But this one seems to work and his didntat least when I saw it

Its mighty interesting to watch all right spoke Paul but well
be in for a wigging if we miss guardmount Better speed her along
Dick

Yes I guess so But weve got time

Dick never finished that sentence Innis interrupted him with a cry of

Look somethings wrong on that aircraft

I should say so yelled Paul Theyve lost control of her

The big biplane was in serious difficulties for it gave a lurch
turned turtle and then suddenly righting shot downward for the river

Theyre going to get a ducking all right cried Innis

Yes and they may be killed or drowned added Paul

Ill do what I can to save em murmured Dick as he turned on more
power and headed his boat for the place where the aircraft was likely
to plunge into the water

Hardly had he done so when with a great splash and a sound as of an
explosion while a cloud of steam arose as the water sprayed on the hot
motor the aircraft shot beneath the waves raised by the
rapidlywhirling propellers

Stand ready now

Get out a preserver

Toss em that life ring

Ready with the boat hook Slow down your engine Dick

The motorboat was at the scene of the accident and when one of the
occupants of the wrecked airship came up to the surface Dick made a
grab for him catching the boat hook in the neck of his coat

The next instant Dick gave a cry of surprise

Larry Dexterthe reporter he fairly shouted How in the world

Let me get aboardIll talk whenwhen I get rid ofofsome of this
water panted Larry Dexter Can you save the others

Ive got one shouted Paul Give me a hand Innis

Together the two cadets lifted into the motorboat a limp and bedraggled
figure And no sooner had he gotten a glimpse of the mans face than
Innis Beeby cried

By Jove If it isnt my cousin Whitfield Vardon



CHAPTER II

THE COLONELS OFFER

Two more surprised youths than Dick Hamilton and Innis Beeby would have
been hard to find That the young millionaire should meet Larry
Dexter a newspaper reporter with whom he had been acquainted some
time in this startling fashion was one thing to wonder at but that
Innis should help in the rescue of his cousin of whom he had just been
speaking was rather too much to crowd into a few strenuous moments

Whitfield gasped Innis when his cousin had been safely gotten
aboard How in the world did you get here And was that your craft

Yes But dont stop to talk now gasped the rescued aviator My
machinist Jack Butt went down with us Can you see anything of him

Eagerly the eyes of the cadets searched the waters that had now
subsided from the commotion caused by the plunging down of the wrecked
aircraft Then Dick cried

I see something moving Right over there

He pointed to where the water was swirling and the next moment he
threw in the clutch of his motor The propeller churned the water to
foam and the craft shot ahead

The next instant a body came to the surface A man began to strike out
feebly but it was evident he was nearly drowned

Thats Jack Thats my helper cried Mr Vardon Can you save him

Take the wheel shouted Dick to Paul And then as the motorboat
shot ahead the rich youth leaned over the gunwale and holding on to
a forward deck cleat with one hand he reached over and with the
other caught the coat collar of the swimmer who had thrown up his
arms and was about to sink again

Ill give you a hand cried Innis and between them the cadets lifted
into the boat the now inert form of Jack Butt

Stop the motor

First aid

Weve got to try artificial respiration

In turn Innis Paul and Dick shot out these words And seeing that
the other two rescued ones were in no need of attention the cadets
proceeded to put to practical use the lessons in first aid to the
drowning they had learned at Kentfield

And while this is going on I am going to take just a few moments in
which to tell my new readers something about the previous books in this
series

The only son of Mortimer Hamilton of Hamilton Corners in New York
state Dick was a millionaire in his own right His mother had left
him a large estate and in the first volume of this series entitled
Dick Hamiltons Fortune Or The Stirring Doings of a Millionaires
Son I related what Dick had to do in order to become fully possessed
of a large sum of money He had to prove that he was really capable of
handling it and he nearly came to grief in doing this as many a
better youth might have done

Dicks uncle Ezra Larabee of Dankville was a rich man but a miser
He was not in sympathy with Dick nor with the plans his sister Dicks
mother had made for her son Consequently Uncle Ezra did all he
could to make it unpleasant for Dick while the latter was paying him a
visit of importance

But Dick triumphed over his uncle and also over certain sharpers who
tried to get the best of him

My second volume entitled Dick Hamiltons Cadet Days Or The
Handicap of a Millionaires Son deals with our heros activities at
the Kentfield Military Academy This was a wellknown school at the
head of which was Colonel Masterly Major Henry Rockford was the
commandant and the institution turned out many firstclass young men
with a groundwork of military training The school was under the
supervision of officers from the regular army the resident one being
Major Webster

Dick had rather a hard time at Kentfieldat firstfor he had to get
over the handicap of being a millionaire But how he did it you may
read and I trust enjoy

In Dick Hamiltons Steam Yacht Or A Young Millionaire and the
Kidnappers Dick got into a peck of trouble to quote his chum
Innis Beeby But the rich youth finally triumphed over the designs of
Uncle Ezra and was able to foil some plotters

Dick Hamiltons Football Team Or A Young Millionaire On the
Gridiron tells of the efforts of Dick to make a firstclass eleven
from the rather poor material he found at Kentfield How he did it
though not without hard work and how the team finally triumphed over
the Blue Hill players you will find set down at length in the book

Dick Hamiltons Touring Car Or A Young Millionaires Race for a
Fortune took our hero on a long trip and in one of the largest
finest and most completely equipped automobiles that a certain firm had
ever turned out

I have mentioned Larry Dexter and I might say that in a line entitled
The Young Reporter Series I have give an account of the doings of
this youth who rose from the position of office boy on a New York
newspaper to be a star man that is one entrusted with writing only
the biggest kind of stories Dick had met Larry while in New York and
Larry had profited by the acquaintanceship by getting a beat or
exclusive story about the young millionaire

On the return of Dick and his cadet chums from a trip to California
the rich youth had again taken up his studies at Kentfield

And now we behold him out in his motorboat having just succeeded in
helping rescue the master and crew of the aircraft that had plunged
into the river

There he breathed

I think hes coming around now

Better get him to shore though Hell need a doctor

Thus remarked Dick Paul and Innis as they labored over the unfortunate
mechanician of the biplane They had used artificial respiration on
him until he breathed naturally

Ill start the boat announced Dick for the craft had been allowed
to drift while the lifesaving work was going on We want to make time
back

This certainly is a surprise remarked Larry Dexter as he tried to
wring some of the water out of his clothes

More to me than it is to you I guess suggested Dick I suppose
you birdmen are used to accidents like this

More or less answered the cousin of Innis Beeby But I never
expected to come to grief and be rescued by Innis

Nor did I expect to see you said the cadet

We were just speaking of you or rather I was as we saw your craft
in the air I was wondering if you had perfected your patent

It doesnt look sodoes it asked the airship inventor with a
rueful smile in the direction of the sunken aircraft I guess Im at
the end of my rope he added sadly But Im glad none of us was
killed

So am I exclaimed Dick But how in the world did you come to take
up aviation Larry he asked of the young newspaper man Have you
given up reporting

No indeed replied Larry Dexter But this air game is getting to be
so important especially the army and navy end of it that my paper
decided we ought to have an expert of our own to keep up with the
times So they assigned me to the job and Im learning how to manage
an aircraft I guess the paper figures on sending me out to scout in
the clouds for news Though if I dont make out better than this
theyll get someone else in my place

Something went wrongI cant understand it said the aircraft
inventor shaking his head The machine ought not to have plunged
down like that I cant understand it

Id like to send the story back to my paper went on Larry

Always on the lookout for news remarked Dick Well see that you
send off your yarn all right Theres a telegraph office in the
Academy now Ill fix it for you

The run to the school dock was soon made and the arrival of Dicks
motorboat with the rescued ones from the airship which had been seen
flying over the parade grounds a little while before made some
commotion

Weve missed guardmount remarked Innis as he saw the other cadets
at the drill

Cant be helped We had a good excuse said Dick Now weve got to
attend to him and he nodded at Jack Butt who seemed to have
collapsed again

With military promptness the mechanic was carried to the hospital and
the school doctor was soon working over him Meanwhile dry garments
had been supplied to Larry and Mr Vardon A messenger came from
Colonel Masterly to learn what was going on and when he heard of the
rescue Dick and his chums were excused from taking part in the days
closing drill

Hes coming around all right the physician remarked to the young
millionaire on the way from the hospital where he had been attending
Jack Butt It seems that he was entangled in some part of the
aircraft and couldnt get to the surface until he was nearly drowned
But hes all right now though he needs rest and care

I wonder if he can stay here asked Dick Oh yes Ill attend to
that for you the doctor promised Ill arrange with Colonel
Masterly about that And your other friendsI think they should
remain too They probably are in rather an unpleasant plight

Ill look after them said Dick I can put them up One is a
newspaper man and the other a cousin of Beebys Hes an airship
inventor

Is that so Colonel Masterly might be interested to know that

Why asked Dick

Because I understand that he is about to add a course in aviation to
the studies here It has been discussed in faculty meetings so it is
no secret

An aviation course at Kentfield cried Dick with shining eyes

Yes Are you interested the doctor asked

Well I hadnt thought about it but I believe I should like to have
an airship the young millionaire went on Down Grit down he
commanded as a beautiful bulldog came racing from the stables to fawn
upon his master I used the word beautiful with certain
restrictions for Grit was about the homeliest bulldog in existence

But his very hideousness made him beautiful to a lover of dogs He
jumped about in delight at seeing Dick again for he had been shut up
so he would not insist on going out in the motorboat

Quarters were provided for Larry Dexter who sent off a brief account
of the accident to the airship and Mr Vardon was looked after by
Innis Butt of course remained in the hospital

Dr Morrison was right when he said that Colonel Masterly would be
interested in meeting the luckless aviator Innis took his cousin to
the head of the school and Mr Vardon told of his invention briefly
and also of the mishap to his biplane

Perhaps this is providential said the colonel musingly For some
time I have been considering the starting of an aviation course here
and it may be you would like to assist me in it I want the cadets to
learn something about the fundamentals of heavierthanair machines
Will you accept a position as instructor

I will gladly said Mr Vardon I might as well admit that I have
no further funds to pursue my experiments though I am satisfied that I
am on the right track But my machine is wrecked

Perhaps it can be raised said the colonel cheerfully We will
talk about that later And we may find a way to have you conduct your
experiments here

I can not thank you enough sir returned the aviator And I am
also deeply indebted to my cousins chumDick Hamilton But for him
and the other cadets in the boat we might all have been drowned

Im glad we were on hand said Dick with a smile



CHAPTER III

DICKS RESOLVE

What do you know about that

A regular course in aviation

And birdmen from the United States Army to came here and show us how
to do stunts

Well you fellows can go in for it if you like but automobiling is
dangerous enough sport for me

Ah whats the matter with you Flying is pretty nearly as safe now
as walking Not half as many birdmen have been killed as there have
railroad travelers

No because there are more railroad travelers to be killed No cloud
flights for mine

A group of cadets Dick Innis and Paul among them were discussing the
latest news at Kentfield

It was the day following the accident to the biplane After a brief
consultation with Mr Vardon and a calling together of his faculty
members Colonel Masterly had made formal announcement that a course in
aviation would be open at Kentfield for those who cared to take it

I think it will be great cried Dick

Are you going in for it asked Paul

I sure amif dad will let me

Oh I guess he will all right spoke Innis He lets you do almost
anything you want toin reason But I know a certain person who WILL
object

Who asked Dick fondling his dog

Your Uncle Ezra

I guess thats so laughed Dick Hell say its expensive and all
that sort of thing and that Ill be sure to break my neck or at least
fracture an arm But we saw one accident that came out pretty well I
think Ill take a chance

So will I cried Paul

I guess you can count me in agreed Innis slowly

How about it Larry asked Dick as the young reporter came across
the campus How does it feel to sail above the clouds

Well I havent yet gone up that far This is only about my fifth
flight and we only did grass cutting for the first fewthat is
going up only a little way above the ground I had to get used to it
gradually

But its great I like it and youre only afraid the first few
minutes After that you dont mind it a bitthat is not until you get
into trouble as we did

And I cant understand that trouble either said Mr Vardon who had
joined the group of cadets Something went wrong

You mean something was MADE to go wrong put in Jack Butt who had
now recovered sufficiently to be about

Something made to go wrong repeated Dick Hamilton wonderingly

Thats what I said That machine was tampered with before we started
on our flight Im sure of it and if we could get it up from the
bottom of the river I could prove it

Be careful warned the aviator Do you know what you are saying
Jack Who would tamper with my machine

Well there are many who might have done it the machinist went on
Some of the mechanics you have discharged for not doing their work
properly might have done it But the fellow I suspect is that young
army officer who got huffy because you wouldnt explain all about your
equalizing gyroscope or stabilizer

Ohyou mean him gasped the aviator

Thats the man declared Jack He went off mad when you turned him
down and I heard him muttering to himself about getting even Im
sure hes the chap to blame for our accident

I should dislike to think that of anyone said Mr Vardon slowly
But I am sure something was wrong with my aircraft It had worked
perfectly in other trials and then it suddenly went back on me I
should like a chance to examine it

Well try and give you that chance said Colonel Masterly who came
up at that moment We are to have a drill in building a pontoon
bridge across the river tomorrow and I will order it thrown across the
stream at the point where your airship went down Then we may be able
to raise the craft

That will be fine exclaimed the airship man I may even be able to
save part of my craft to use in demonstration purposes I may even be
able to use part of it in building another It was a fine machine
but something went wrong

Something was made to go wrong growled Jack Butt If ever we raise
her Ill prove it too

Well young gentlemen I suppose you have heard the news questioned
the colonel as the aviatorinventor and his helper walked off to one
side of the campus talking earnestly together

You mean about the airship instruction we are to get here sir asked
Dick

Thats it And I am also glad to announce that I have heard from the
war department and they are going to send some army aviators here to
give us the benefit of their work and also to show some of you cadets
how to fly

There was a cheer at this though some of the lads looked a bit dubious

Are you really going in for it Dick asked Innis after there had
been an informal discussion among the colonel and some of the boys
about the aviation instruction

Well I am unless I change my mind replied Dick with a smile Of
course after I make my first flight if I ever do it may be my last
one

Huh Youre not taking a very cheerful view of it retorted Innis
to think that youre going to come a smash the first shot out of the
locker

Oh I didnt mean just that replied Dick quickly I meant that I
might lose my nerve after the first flight and not go up again

Guess there isnt much danger of you losing your nerve said Paul
Drew admiringly Ive generally noticed that you have it with you on
most occasions

Thanks exclaimed Dick with a mock salute

Strolling over the campus Dick and his chums talked airships and
aviation matters until it was time for guardmount

During the next day or two it might have been noticed that Dick
Hamilton was rather more quiet than usual In fact his chums did
notice and comment on it A number of times they had seen the young
millionaire in a brown study walking off by himself and again he
could be observed strolling about gazing earnestly up at the clouds
and sky

Say I wonder whats come over Dick asked Paul of Innis one
afternoon

Blessed if I know was the answer unless hes fallen in love

Get out Hes too sensible But he sure has something on his mind

I agree with you Well if he wants to know hell tell us

So they let the matter drop for the time being But Dicks abstraction
grew deeper He wrote a number of letters and sent some telegrams
and his friends began to wonder if matters at Dicks home were not
altogether right

But the secret if such it could be called was solved by the
unexpected arrival of Mr Hamilton at Kentfield He appeared on the
campus after drill one day and Dick greeted his parent
enthusiastically

So you got here after all Dad he cried as he shook hands Paul
and Innis also coming over to meet the millionaire

Well I felt I just had to come Dick after all you wrote and
telegraphed me replied Mr Hamilton I thought we could do better
by having a talk than by correspondence But I tell you frankly I
dont approve of what you are going to do

Dicks chums looked curiously at him

I may as well confess laughed the young millionaire Im thinking
of buying an airship fellows

Whew whistled Paul

Thats going some as the boys say commented Innis Tell us all
about it

I will said Dick frankly Its been on my mind the last few days
and

So thats been your worry interrupted Paul I knew it was
something but I never guessed it was that Fire ahead

Ever since your cousin came here Innis in his craft and since the
colonel has arranged for aviation instruction Ive been thinking of
having an airship of my own Dick resumed I wrote to dad about it
but he didnt seem to take to the idea very much

No I cant say that I did said Mr Hamilton decidedly I
consider it dangerous

Its getting more safe every day Dad Look how dangerous
automobiling was at the start and yet thats nearly perfect now
though of course therell always be accidents But I wont go in for
this thing Dad if you really dont want me to

Well I wont say no and Ill not say yesat least not just yet
said Mr Hamilton slowly I want to think it over have a talk with
some of these birdmen as you call them and then you and Ill
consider it together Dick Thats why I came on I want to know more
about it before I make up my mind

Mr Hamilton became the guest of the colonel as he had done on several
occasions before and in the following days he made as careful a
study of aviation as was possible under the circumstances He also had
several interviews with Mr Vardon

Have you decided to let your son have an airship of his own the
colonel asked when the millionaire announced that he would start for
New York the following morning

Well Ive been thinking pretty hard about the matter was the
answer I hardly know what to do Im afraid its only another one
of Dicks harebrained ideas and if he goes in for it hell come a
cropper

And maybe on the whole it wouldnt be a bad idea to let him go in
for it and make a fizzle of it It would be a good lesson to him
though I would certainly regret exceedingly if he were even slightly
injured

On the other hand Dick is pretty lucky He may come out all right I
suppose hell go in and try to win some prizes at these aviation meets
they hold every once in a while

Yes there are to be several spoke the colonel I heard something
about the government offering a big prize for a successful
transcontinental flightfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific but I know
nothing of the details

Well I suppose Dick would be rash enough to try for that if he hears
about it murmured Mr Hamilton I guess taking it on all sides
that Ill let him have an airship if only to prove that he cant work
it He needs a little toning down most young chaps do I fancy I
know I did when I was a lad Yes if he makes a fizzle of it the
lesson may be worth something to himthrowing his money away on an
airship But Ill give my consent

And when Dick was told by his parent not very enthusiastically that
he might secure an aircraft the young cadets delight was great

Thats fine he cried shaking hands heartily with his father

Well I hope you succeed in flying your machine when you get it but
as the Scotchman said I have my doubts said Mr Hamilton grimly

Humph mused Dick later Dad doesnt think much of me in the
aviator class I guess But Ill go in for this thing now if only to
show him that I can do it Ive done harder stunts and if the
Hamilton luck doesnt fail Ill do this Ill make a long flight and
put one over on dad again He thinks I cant do itbut Ill show him
I can exclaimed Dick with sparkling eyes

Dick communicated his fathers decision to Paul and Innis

Im going to have an airship he cried It wasnt easy to get dads
consent but he gave it Now how about you fellows coming on a cruise
in the clouds with me

Say how big a machine are you going to have Paul wanted to know

Well my ideas are rather hazy yet admitted the young millionaire
but if I can get it built its going to be one of the biggest
airships yet made Well travel in style if we travel at all he
said with a laugh Im thinking of having an aircraft with some sort
of enclosed cabin on it

Say that will be quite an elaborate affair commented Innis

The question is will you fellows take a chance with me in it asked
Dick

Well I guess so responded Paul slowly

Innis nodded in rather a fainthearted fashion

Now said Dick I want to see

He was interrupted by shouts in the direction of the river

There she is

Shes floating down

Lets get her

A number of cadets were thus crying out

Come on yelled Dick Somethings happened Maybe my motorboat is
adrift



CHAPTER IV

THE ARMY AVIATORS

Dick Paul and Innis set off at a quick pace toward the stream which
flowed at the foot of the broad expanse of green campus and parade
ground As they hurried on they were joined by other cadets in like
haste

What is it asked the young millionaire

Dont know was the answer Something happened on the river thats
all I heard

Dick and his chums were soon in a position to see for themselves and
what they beheld was a curious sort of raft with torn sails or so at
least it seemed floating down with the current Then as the waters
swirled about the odd craft a piece like the tail of some great fish
arose for a moment

What in the name of Gatling guns is it asked Paul wonderingly

Its the airship cried Innis My cousins wrecked airship It
must have been stuck in the mud or held by some snag and now its
come to the surface We ought to get it Hell want to save it Maybe
he can use part of the engine again and hes out of funds to buy a new
one I know

Besides he wants to see if it had been tampered with by someone so as
to bring about an accident suggested Paul

Well get it cried Dick Come on In my motorboat

The speedy watercraft was in readiness for a run and the three cadets
racing down to her soon had the motor started and the bow of the boat
pointed to the floating airship The latter was moving slowly from the
force of the current which was not rapid here The affair of wings
struts planes and machinery floated half submerged and probably
would not have sunk when the accident occurred except that the great
speed at which it was travelling forced it below the surface even as
one can force under a piece of wood

But the wood rises and the buoyant airship would have done the same
perhaps save for the fact that it had become caught Now it was freed

Make this rope fast to it directed Dick as he guided his motorboat
close to the airship Well tow it to the dock

Paul and Innis undertook this part of the work and in a few moments
the Mabel Dicks boat was headed toward shore towing the wrecked
airship A crowd of the cadets awaited with interest the arrival

When the Mabel had been made fast to the dock other ropes were
attached to the aircraft that floated at her stern and the wrecked
biplane was slowly hauled up the sloping bank of the stream

Some smash that

Look at the planes all bent and twisted

But the motor is all there

Say shes bigger than I thought she was

Thus the young cadets commented on the appearance of the craft as it
was hauled out Word had been sent to Mr Vardon and his helper to
come and look at the salvaged wreck and they were goon on the scene
together with Larry Dexter who as usual was always on hand when
there was a chance to get an item of news

Ill get another scoop out of this for my paper he exclaimed to
Dick Then I guess Id better be getting back to New York They may
want to send me on some other assignment for it doesnt look as though
Id do any more flying through the air in that machine

Say dont be in too much of a hurry to go away remarked Dick as he
ceased from pulling on the rope attached to the wrecked airship

Why not asked Larry What do you mean

Well youre not on any regular news stunt just now are you
inquired Dick of the young reporter That is you dont have to
report back to the office at any special time

No replied Larry Im a sort of free lance Im supposed to be
learning how to run an airship so I can qualify and get a license and
be able to help out the paper on such a stunt if they need me They
assigned me to this Mr Vardon because it looked as though he had a
good thing Now that its busted I suppose Ill be sent out with some
other aviator and Id better be getting back to New York and find out
what the paper wants me to do

Well as I said dont be in too much of a hurry went on Dick with a
smile

You talk and act as though there was something in the wind remarked
Larry

There is and theres going to be something more in the wind soon or
rather in the air said Dick I might as well tell you Im going to
have an airship and

You are interrupted Larry Good for you Ill give you a good
writeup when you make your first flight

I wasnt thinking so much of that proceeded the young millionaire
But when I do get my airship Id like to have you make some flights
with me That might serve your end as well as going with some other
aviator and you could be getting in the practice that your paper wants
for you

Fine and dandy cried Larry Im with you Dick Ill send off a
wire at once and let the managing editor know Im going to get right
on the flying job again This will be great

I dont know that therell be such an awful lot of news in it at
first went on Dick for Ive got to learn this art of flying and I
dont expect to do any hairraising stunts right off the reel

But Larry there may be other news for you around this Academy soon

Real news

Yes You probably heard what Mr Vardon said about his machine being
tampered with

I sure did And I think the same thing myself It worked to
perfection the day before and then all at once she turned turtle
The gyroscope equilibrizer must have broken

Well you can see what happened for weve got her out of the water
now said Dick And there may be more news when the army aviators
arrive

Are they coming here I hadnt heard Ive been so busy getting
straightened out after my plunge into the river

Yes theyre coming here to give us instructions and there may be all
sorts of stunts pulled off So youd better stick

I will thanks But Im mostly interested in your airship It sure
will be great to take a flight with you But theres Mr Vardon I
want to hear what he says

The aviator and his helper who had almost fully recovered from their
narrow escape from death were carefully examining the airship which
was now hauled out on a level spot in the campus just above the river
bank Eagerly the cadets crowded around the machine

Come here Grit called Dick to his prize bulldog First you know
someone will step on you and youll just naturally take a piece out of
his leg You dont belong in a crowd

Grit came at the word of command and Dick slipping on the leash gave
the animal in charge of one of the orderlies to be taken to the stable
Grit whined and barked in protest at being separated from his master
but Dick wanted no accidents

Do you find anything wrong asked Innis of his cousin as the latter
went carefully over each part of the wrecked airship

Well its hard to say on account of there being so many broken
places was the answer The engine is not as badly smashed as I
expected but it will take some time to examine and test the gyroscope
attachment I shall remove it and set it up separately

Well its my opinion that it was monkeyed with and done on purpose
too declared Jack Butt And I could almost name the fellow who did
it He was

Hush No names if you please interrupted the aviator We will
investigate first

All right sir Just as you say grudgingly agreed the other But
if ever I get my hands on him

Jack Butt looked rather vindictive and probably with good reason For
had he not been near to death and as he thought through the evil
work of some enemy

The wrecked aircraft was hauled to one of the barrack sheds which Mr
Vardon announced would be his temporary workshop for possible repairs

The rest of that day and all of the next was spent by Mr Vardon in
taking his wrecked machine apart saving that which could be used
again and looking particularly for defects in the gyroscope
stabilizer or equilibrizer Larry and Jack Butt helped at this work
and Dick and the other cadets spent as much time as they could from
their lessons and drills watching the operations

For the students were much interested in aviation and now that it was
known that the army aviators were to come to Kentfield and that Dick
Hamilton one of the best liked of the cadets was to have a big
airship of his own many who had said they would never make a flight
were changing their minds

It was one afternoon about a week following the wrecking of Mr
Vardons machine that as the cadets in their natty uniforms were
going through the last drill of the day a peculiar sound was heard in
the air over the parade ground

There was a humming and popping a throbbing moan as it were and
despite the fact that the orders were eyes front most of the cadets
looked up

And they saw soaring downward toward the campus which made an ideal
landing spot two big aircraft

The army aviators someone cried nor was there any rebuke from the
officers The army aviators

At ease came the order for the commandant realized that the
students could hardly be expected to stand at attention when there was
the chance to see an airship land

Then a few seconds later the two craft came gently down to the ground
undulating until they could drop as lightly as a boys kite And as
they came to a stop with the application of the drag brake after
rolling a short distance on the bicycle wheels the craft were
surrounded by the eager cadets



CHAPTER V

SUSPICIONS

Casting aside the straps that bound them to their machines the army
aviators leaped lightly from their seats The big propellers from
which the power had been cut off as the birdmen started to volplane to
the ground ceased revolving and the hum and roar of the powerful
motors was no more heard

In their big leather helmets and leather jackets and with their
enormous goggles on the birdmen looked like anything but
spickandspan soldiers of Uncle Sam But dress in the army has
undergone a radical change The fuss and feathers are gradually
disappearing and utility is the word It was so in regard to the
aviators They were not hampered by uniforms

Kentfield Military Academy inquired one of the officers evidently
in command He looked about for someone in authority

Kentfield Academy sir replied Colonel Masterly who had come up I
am in charge here and he introduced himself The army man who wore
a captains shoulder straps saluted and remarked

I am Captain Grantly in charge That is Captain Wakefield in the
other machine With him is Lieutenant McBride and my companion is
Lieutenant Larson I presume you expected us

Oh yes said Colonel Masterly as he shook hands with the visitors
Im sure we are all glad to see you

Dick and his chums looked on with interest The army aviators seemed
efficient and pleasant menthat is all but one The first sight he
had of the face of Lieutenant Larson after the latter had removed his
protecting helmet and goggles made Dick say to himself

That fellow will bear watching I dont like the look in his eyes

But Dick said nothing of this to Paul or Innis He made up his mind he
would learn their impressions later

We thought we might as well come on in the machines as to have them
taken down shipped here and then have to assemble them again would
take too much time went on Captain Grantly Though we expect
later to give your students a practical demonstration in how the
biplanes are put together so they may understand something of how to
make repairs

We came on from the nearest army aviation grounds and had a most
successful flight I must send back word to Major Dalton

Our telephone or telegraph service is at your disposal said
Colonel Masterly If you will come with me

Excuse me but we carry with us our own means of communication said
Captain Grantly with a smile We are going on the assumption
constantly that we are in an enemys country

Consequently we go prepared as though there were a state of war We
shall communicate with our base by means of wireless

I am afraid we cant accommodate you there went on the head of the
military school We are installing a wireless outfit but it is not
yet completed the colonel said

Oh we carry our own was the unexpected retort Lieutenant Larson
if you and Lieutenant McBride will get the balloon ready Captain
Wakefield and myself will work out the cipher dispatch and send it

We use a code in our wireless he went on to explain and it takes a
few minutes to make up the message

But I heard you speak of a balloon said Colonel Masterly I dont
see how you carry one on your machine

Here it is was the answer and a deflated rubberized silk bag was
produced from a locker back of the pilots seat This is the latest
idea in airship wireless went on Captain Grantly as he directed the
lieutenants to get out the rest of the apparatus We carry with us a
deflated balloon which will contain about two hundred cubic yards of
lifting gas The gas itself greatly compressed is in this cylinder
Theres enough for several chargings

We fill the balloon and attach to it our aerial wires The balloon
takes them up about four hundred feetthe wires weigh about twenty
pounds I might say Then we carry a light sending instrument It has
a considerable range though we can receive messages from a much
greater distance than we can send as our force for a sending current
is limited

As he was talking the others were working and the cadets looked on
interestedly The drill had been abandoned and officers and students
crowded up near the army aviators to see what was going on

With a sharp hiss the compressed gas rushed from the containing
cylinder into the deflated balloon The silken sides puffed out
losing their wrinkles The balloon gradually assumed larger
proportions

Ready with the wires asked Captain Grantly

All ready sir replied Lieutenant Larson Dick now heard him speak
for the first time and did not like his voice There are some persons
who make a bad impression on you at the first meeting Often this may
he unjustified but Dicks first impressions were seldom wrong

The wires forming the wireless aerial were carried up on two light
spreaders hanging down from a network that went over the balloon bag
From the aerials depended the wires that were attached to the receiving
and sending apparatus These wires were on a reel and would he
uncoiled as the balloon arose The earthend would be attached to the
telephone receivers and to the apparatus consisting of a sparkgap
wheel and other instruments designed to send into space the electrical
impulses that could be broken up into dots dashes and spaces spelling
out words according to the Morse or Continental codewhichever was
used

Captain Grantly looked over everything His assistants signified that
every connection was made

Send her up ordered the commander and as the catch holding the
balloon was released the spherical bag of gas shot into the air
carrying with it the aerials and unreeling the connecting wires

Quickly it rose to nearly five hundred feet and when it had been
anchored all was soon in readiness

Meanwhile a code dispatch had been written out and as it was handed to
Captain Wakefield who was to operate the wireless he began depressing
the key that made and broke the electrical current The current itself
came from a small but powerful storage battery and it had been
switched on The current also set in motion a toothed wheel of brass
This wheel revolved on its axis with the points or teeth passing
rapidly in front of a platinum contact point

As each tooth thus came in opposition to the point a blue spark of
electricity would shoot out with a vicious snap that is if the
connection key were pressed down If the key were not depressed no
current flowed

I presume most of you understand how the wireless works so I will not
give you a complete description save to say that it is just like a
telegraph system in fundamentals The only difference is that no
connecting metallic wires are needed between stations

A group of wires in parallels called aerials are hung in the air at
one point or station and a similar set is suspended at the other
station The electrical current jumps through the air from one group
of wires to the other without being directly connected hence the name
wireless though really some wires are used

The electrical impulse can be sent for thousands of miles through the
air without any directly connecting wires And the method of
communication is by means of dots dashes and spaces

You have doubtless heard the railroad or other telegraph instruments
clicking You can hold your table knife blade between two tines of
your fork and imitate the sound of the telegraph very easily

If you move your knife blade up and down once quickly that will
represent a dot If you move it more slowly holding it down for a
moment that would be a dash A space would be the interval between a
dot and a dash or between two dots or two dashes

Thus by combinations of dots dashes and spaces the letters of the
alphabet may be made and words spelled out For instance a dot and a
dash is A

In telegraphing of course the operator listens to the clicking of the
brass sounder in front of him on the desk But in wireless the
electrical waves or current received is so weak that it would not
operate the sounder So a delicate telephone receiver is used This is
connected to the receiving wires and as the sender at his station
perhaps a thousand miles away presses down his key and allows it to
come up thus making dots dashes and spaces corresponding clicks are
made in the telephone receiver at the ear of the other operator

It takes skill to thus listen to the faint clicks that may be spelled
out into words but the operators are very skillful In sending
messages a very high tension current is needed as most of it is
wasted leaping through the air as it does So that though the clicks
may sound very loud at the sending apparatus and the blue sparks be
very bright still only faint clicks can be heard in the headtelephone
receiver at the other end

You may send directed Captain Grantly to Captain Wakefield and the
blue sparks shot out in a dazzling succession as the spiked wheel spun
around This was kept up for some little time after the receiving
operator at the army headquarters had signified that he was at
attention Then came a period of silence Captain Wakefield was
receiving a message through space but he alone could hear this through
the telephone receiver

He wrote it out in the cipher code and soon it was translated

I informed them that we had arrived safely said Captain Grantly to
Colonel Masterly and they have informed me that we are to remain here
until further notice instructing your cadets in the use of the
aircraft

And we are very glad to have you here replied the commandant of
Kentfield If you will come with me I will assign you to quarters

We had better put away our biplanes and haul down our wireless
outfit suggested Captain Grantly

Allow me to assign some of the cadets to help you suggested the
colonel and this offer being accepted Dick to his delight was one
of those detailed as were Innis and Paul

Giving his instructions to the two lieutenants Captain Grantly with
the junior captain accompanied Colonel Masterly to the main buildings
of the Academy

Well lets dig in and get through with this job suggested
Lieutenant Larson in surly tones to his companion Then Im going to
ask for leave and go to town Im tired

So am I but weve got to tighten up some of those guy wires They
are loose and need attention They might order a flight any time his
fellow lieutenant said

Well you can stay and tighten em if you like Im not was the
growling retort Im sick of this business anyhow Let some of the
kids do the work

They dont know how was the goodnatured answer of Lieutenant
McBride

There is a professional aviator here now said Dick as he recalled
Mr Vardon We might get him to help you

I dont care said Lieutenant Larson as he began hauling down the
suspended balloon I only know Im sick of so much work I think
Ill go back into the artillery

Dick and his chums naturally did not care much for the surly soldier
but they liked Lieutenant McBride at once He smilingly told them what
to do and the boys helped to push the machines to a shed that had been
set aside for them The wireless apparatus was taken apart and stored
away the gas being let out of the balloon

The work was almost finished when Larry Dexter with Mr Vardon and
the latters helper Jack came across to the sheds They had come to
see the army airships

By this time Lieutenant Larson had finished what he considered was his
share of the work and was on his way to get a brief leave of absence
from his captain At the entrance to the shed he came face to face
with Mr Vardon and Jack

Oh so youre the professional aviator they spoke of said Larson
with a sneer in his tone

Yes Im here replied Mr Vardon quietly I did not expect to see
you here though

The surprise is mutual mocked the other I read about your
failure I suppose now you will quit fooling with that gyroscope of
yours and give my method a trial

I never will I am convinced that I am right and that you are wrong

Youre foolish was the retort

Jack Butt stepped forward and whispered in the ear of his employer so
that at least Dick heard what he said

I believe HE did it were the tense words of the machinist



CHAPTER VI

DICKS FIRST FLIGHT

Mr Vardon gave his helper a quick and warning glance

Hush he exclaimed as he looked to see if Lieutenant Larson had
heard what Jack had said But the army man evidently had not He gave
the machinist a glance however that was not the most pleasant in the
world It was evident that there was some feeling between the two
Dick wondered what it was and what Jacks ominous words meant

Having put away the two biplanes and requested the cadets to look at
them as much as they liked but not to meddle with the apparatus the
two lieutenants left the sheds to report to their respective captains
Mr Vardon and his helper remained with Dick and his chums

Very fine machines said the aviator Compared to my poor pile of
junk very fine machines indeed

But part of yours is good isnt it asked Dick You can use part
of it I should think

Very little was the hopeless reply The damage was worse than I
thought My gyroscope attachment is a total wreck and it will cost
money to build a new one

Yes and that gyroscope was tampered with before we started on this
last flight declared Jack with conviction And Im sure HE did
it he added pointing an accusing finger at the retreating form of
Lieutenant Larson

You must not say such things cried the aviator You have no proof

I have all the proof I want as far as he is concerned declared Jack
Maybe he didnt intend to kill us or hurt us but he sure did want to
wreck the machine when he tampered with the gyroscope

What is the gyroscope asked Dick

It is an invention of mine and one over which Lieutenant Larson and I
had some argument said Mr Vardon

You probably know the aviator went on while Dick Paul and Innis
with several other cadets listened interestedly you probably know
that one of the great problems of aviation is how to keep a machine
from turning turtle or turning over when it strikes an unexpected
current or air pocket in the upper regions Of course a birdman
may by warping his wings or changing the elevation of his rudder
come out safely but there is always a chance of danger or death

If there was some automatic arrangement by which the airship would
right itself and take care of the unexpected tilting there would be
practically no danger

I realized that as soon as I began making airships and so I devised
what I call a gyroscope equilibrizer or stabilizer A gyroscope you
know is a heavy wheel spinning at enormous speed on an antifriction
axle Its great speed tends to keep it in stable equilibrium and if
displaced by outside forces it will return to its original position

You have probably seen toy ones a heavy lead wheel inside a ring
When the wheel is spinning that and the ring in which it is contained
may be placed in almost any position on a very slender support and
they will remain stable or at rest

So I put a gyroscope on my airship and I found that it kept the
machine in a state of equilibrium no matter what position we were
forced to take by reason of adverse currents Of course it was not an
entire success but I was coming to that

In the biplane which was wrecked in the river I had my latest
gyroscope It seemed to be perfect and with Jack and Harry I had
made a number of beautiful flights I even flew alone upside down and
had no trouble

Before that I had made the acquaintance of Lieutenant Larson who is
also an expert aviator He worked for me before he went in the army
He had his own ideas about equilibrium and his plan which he wanted
me to adopt consists of tubes of mercury that can automatically be
tilted at different angles I do not believe they will ever work and
I told him so I refused to use them and he and I parted not the
best of friends He wanted his invention exploited but I refused to
try it as I thought it dangerous

When my gyroscope worked fairly well I presume Lieutenant Larson was
professionally jealous At any rate he left me and I am glad of it

But he was around our workshop just before we made this last flight
insisted Jack He came in pretending he had left some of his
important drawings behind when he went away but I noticed that he hung
around the airship a good bit I saw him looking at and running the
gyroscope and Im sure he did something to it that caused it to fail
to work and so wrecked us

You should not say such things chided Mr Vardon

Well I believe its true insisted Jack And you found something
wrong with the gyroscope when you took it from the airship didnt
you

Yes but that may have occurred in the wreck

No that gyroscope began to act wrong before we started to fall went
on the helper I noticed it and I believe that mean lieutenant
monkeyed with it He wanted you to think your plans were failures

I should dislike to believe that of anyone spoke Mr Vardon
seriously

Well Im going to keep my eye on him said Jack He wont get
another chance at any of our machines

It was a day or so after this conversation that Dick came upon his chum
Innis talking to Mr Vardon They seemed very much in earnest and at
Dicks approach the aviator strolled away Innis stood regarding him a
moment and remarked in a low tone

Poor chap

Whats the trouble asked Dick quickly Has anything happened to
him

Yes Dick a whole lot of things replied Innis earnestly I feel
mighty sorry for him You know how his airship was wrecked but thats
only one of his troubles Hes practically lost every cent he has in
the world and hes deeply in debt for he borrowed money to build his
aircraft and perfect his stabilizer Hes just about down and out
poor chap and he feels mighty blue I can tell you

When you came up I was just trying to figure out a way to help him
But I dont see how I can My dad hasnt any too much money himself
since some of his investments failed or hed pull my cousin out of
this hole But as it is I dont see whats to be done And his
gyroscope stabilizer will work too only he wont get a chance to
prove it now

Dick was silent a moment and then he asked

Say Innis would it help your cousin any if he had a contract to
build airships and could install his stabilizer on one of them

Why of course it would Dick That would be just the very thing hed
want But whod give him such a contract especially after this
accident And he hasnt any money to back up his claims In fact hes
a bankrupt Nobody would give him such a chance

Yes I think someone would said Dick quietly

Who asked Innis quickly

I would Its this way the young millionaire went on Ive fully
made up my mind to have an airship since dad consented though I
believe hes secretly laughing at me Now the kind of craft I want
doesnt come ready madeit will have to be built to order

So why cant I contract with your cousin to make my airship for me
Id be willing to pay all expenses and whatever his services were
worth so he could make some money that way Id a good deal rather
give him a chance on the work than some stranger Besides I like his
idea of a gyroscope and even if he doesnt want to build my craft
Id like to arrange to buy one of his stabilizers Do yon think he
would like to take the contract from me

Do I cried Innis earnestly Say hell jump at the chance You try
him and see Say this is fine of you old man

Oh nonsense It isnt anything of the sort protested Dick Ive
got to have somebody build my airship and Id rather it would be your
cousin than anyone else

Its fine and dandy Innis exclaimed Come on lets find him and
tell him He needs something to cheer him up for hes got the blues
horribly Come along Dick

To say that Mr Vardon was delighted to accept Dicks offer is putting
it mildly Yet he was not too demonstrative

This is the best news Ive heard in a long while he said I guess
my cousin has told you Im pretty badly embarrassed financially he
added

Yes assented Dick Well I happen to have plenty of money through
no fault of my own and well do this airship business up properly

Id like you to get started at it as soon as you can and as there
will be preliminary expenses Im going to advance you some cash
Youll have to order certain parts made up wont you he asked

Yes I presume so agreed the aviator

And of course Ill want your stabilizer on my craft

Thats very good of you to say It will give me a fine chance to
demonstrate it said Mr Vardon

Later in the day Dick his chums the aviator and Larry Dexter were
talking about some of the flights made in the army machines that
afternoon

Can you arrange to have a wireless outfit on my airship asked the
young millionaire as an exchange of wireless talk had been a feature
of the exhibition that day

Oh yes that can easily be done assented the birdman

Say youre going to have a fine outfit complimented Paul

Might as well have a good one while Im at it answered Dick with a
laugh Ive got to make good on dads account anyhow I cant stand
him laughing at me I wish I had my airship now

Ill start building it soon promised Mr Vardon

Ill want it in time for the summer vacation went on Dick Im
going to spend a lot of time in the air

Why dont you make a try for the prize suggested Mr Vardon

What prize Dick wanted to know

Why the United States Government to increase interest in airship
navigation and construction especially for army purposes has offered
a prize of twenty thousand dollars for the first flight from the
Atlantic to the Pacific or from New York to San Francisco by an
airship carrying at least three persons Only two landings are allowed
during the flight to take on gasolene or make repairs Why dont you
try for that

What me try for that prize in the first airship I ever owned
exclaimed Dick I wouldnt have the nerve I guess the government
doesnt want amateurs in the transcontinental flight

It doesnt make a bit of difference declared Mr Vardon It is
going to be an open competition And let me tell you amateurs have
done as much if not more than the professionals to advance and
improve aviation Why as a matter of fact were all amateurs We are
learning something new every day The art or business of flying is
too new to have in it anything but amateurs Dont let that stop you
Dick

Well Ill think about it said the young millionaire

Dick obtained some detailed information and entry blanks for the
government prize contest and a little later announced to his chums

Well fellows in view of what Mr Vardon said about amateurs maybe I
will have a try for that prize It will give us an object instead of
merely flying aimlessly about And if I should win wouldnt I have
the laugh on dad Yes Ill make a try for it he added

And well help you cried Paul

And Ill make a good story of it promised Larry Dexter

I guess wed better get the airship first suggested Innis dryly

Oh Ill look after that promised his aviator cousin

The days that followed were busy ones at Kentfield Academy A course
of instruction was arranged concerning the making and flying of
airships In the former Mr Vardon was the chief lecturer as he had
had more practical experience in building the aircraft than had either
of the army captains

But the army men had made a study of air currents and the management
of biplanes and monoplanes and were equal to Mr Vardon in this
respect And so the cadets looked on and listened watching the army
aviators test their machines run them over the starting ground and
finally by a tilting of the rudders send the machines up like big
birds

Young gentlemen announced Colonel Masterly after chapel exercises
one morning I have an important announcement to make You have been
studying aviation for some time now and it is necessary if you keep
on with it to have practical work Therefore we have decided that
taking turns those cadets in this course will make a flight beginning
with today You will go up one in each aeroplane with the two army
officers who will look after and instruct you

I will now call for volunteers to make the first flight Dont all
speak at once added the colonel with a grim smile

There was a moment of breathless pause and then from where he sat
Dick arose With a salute he said

Ill volunteer sir

Good came in whispered comment that the colonel did not try to check

And Ill also volunteer spoke Innis quickly

So will I added Paul and then several more announced their
intention

That afternoon came around very quickly it seemed Out on the
starting ground were the two big machines being looked over by the
army men The cadets were drawn up in files

All ready sir announced Captain Grantly to Major Rockford The
first cadet will take his place

Dick Hamilton called the commandant and our hero stepped forward
for his first airship flight



CHAPTER VII

A QUEER LANDING

Now dont get nervous said Captain Grantly to Dick with a grim
smile as the young millionaire took his seat in the place provided for
the third occupant of the biplane

Well Ill try my best answered Dick smiling ruefully Am I to do
anything

Not a thing Captain Grantly assured him Just sit still thats
all

Dick rather wished he could have gone in the other machine for he had
no liking for the surly lieutenant with the captain But Dick had been
assigned to this craft and military rules prevailed at Kentfield You
did as you were told without question

Dick took his place and watched with interest the operations of
Captain Grantly and his lieutenant Whatever one thought of the
latter personally it must be admitted that he knew his business when
it came to airships In some matters even his superior officer
Captain Grantley deferred to the judgment of Larson

You wont have to do a thing went on the lieutenant to Dick Just
sit still and above all no matter what happens dont touch any of
the wheels or levers

No that might wreck us added the captain

Well manipulate the machine at the same time telling you and
showing you how to do it In time you will run it yourself with us
looking on and I believe it is the intention of Colonel Masterly to
have you cadets finally operate a machine on your own responsibility

I hope I may learn to do so spoke Dick for Im going to have a
craft of my own

Are you indeed asked the captain interestedly Its rather an
expensive pleasurenot like automobiling

Well luckily or not I happen to have plenty of money said Dick
Im going to have quite a large machine built

Was it fancy or did Lieutenant Larson look at Dick with peculiar
meaning in his rather shifty eyes Dick however was too much
occupied in the coming flight to pay much attention to this

If youre going to have a machine perhaps youre going to have a try
for the twenty thousand dollar prize suggested Captain Grantly as he
tested the gasolene and spark levers and looked at several
turnbuckles which tightened the guy wires

Well I have about decided to answered Dick looking over at the
other aircraft in which Paul Drew was to make an ascent

Jove I wish I had that chance exclaimed Larson Im sure with my
mercury balancer I could

There you go again cried Captain Grantly I tell you your idea is
all wrong about that balancer Wing warping is the only proper way

But that isnt automatic and what is needed is an automatic balancer
or equilibrizer insisted the lieutenant

Well we wont discuss it now went on the captain Are you all
ready Mr Hamilton

All ready yes sir

The captain and Lieutenant Larson took their places one on either side
of Dick Some of the orderlies at the Academy had been detailed to
assist in the start holding back on the biplane until the engine had
attained the necessary speed

There was an arrangement whereby the machine could be held in leash as
it were by a rope and when the necessary pressure developed from the
propeller blades the rope could be loosed from the aviators seat
But that attachment was not in use at Kentfield then

The powerful motor hummed and throbbed for a muffler was temporarily
dispensed with on account of its weight Every unnecessary ounce
counts on an airship as it is needful to carry as much oil and
gasolene as possible and the weight given over to a muffler could be
more advantageously applied to gasolene on the smaller craft

Faster and faster whirled the big blades cutting through the air The
captain kept his eyes on a balance scale by which was registered the
pull of the propellers

Thats enough he cried Let her go

Dick felt the machine move slowly forward on the rubber tired bicycle
wheels over the grassy starting ground gradually acquiring speed
before it would mount upward into the air

Perhaps a word of explanation about airships may not be out of place
Those of you who know the principle on which they work or who have
seen them may skip this part if you wish

The main difference between a balloon and an aeroplane is that the
balloon is lighter than air being filled with a very light gas which
causes it to rise

An aeroplane is heavier than air and in order to keep suspended must
be constantly in motion The moment it stops moving forward it begins
to fall downward

There are several kinds of airships but the principle ones are
monoplanes and biplanes Mono means one and monoplane has but one set
of wings being built much after the fashion of a bird

A biplane as the name indicates consists of two sets of planes one
above the other There are some triplanes but they have not been very
successful and there are some freak aeroplanes built with as many as
eight sets

If you will scale a sheet of tin or a thin flat stone or even a
slate from a roof into the air you will have the simplest form of an
aeroplane The stone or tin is heavier than the amount of air it
displaces but it stays up for a comparatively long time because it is
in motion The moment the impulse you have given it by throwing fails
then it begins to fall

The engine or motor aboard an aeroplane keeps it constantly in
motion and it glides along through the air resting on the atmosphere
by means of the planes or wings

If you will take a clam shell and holding it with the concave side
toward the ground scale it into the air you will see it gradually
mount upward If you hold the convex side toward the ground and throw
it you will see the clam shell curve downward

That is the principle on which airships mount upward and descend while
in motion In a biplane there is either a forward or rear deflecting
rudder as well as one for steering from side to side The latter works
an the same principle as does the rudder of a boat in the water If
this rudder is bent to the right the craft goes to the right because
of the pressure of air or water on the rudder twisted in that
direction And if the rudder is deflected to the left the head of the
craft takes that direction

Just as the curve of a clam shell helps it to mount upward so the
curve of the elevating or depressing rudder on an airship helps it to
go up or down If the rudder is inclined upward the aeroplane shoots
toward the clouds When the rudder is parallel to the plane of the
earths surface the airship flies in a straight line When the rudder
is tilted downward down goes the craft

I hope I have not wearied you with this description but it was
perhaps needful to enable those who have never seen an aeroplane to
understand the working principle One point more A gasolene motor
very powerful is used to whirl the wooden propeller blades that shove
the airship through the air as the propeller of a motorboat shoves
that craft through the water

Faster and faster across the grassy ground went the biplane containing
Dick Hamilton and the army officers It was necessary to get this
running start to acquire enough momentum so that the craft would
rise just as a heavy bird has sometimes to run along the ground a few
steps before its wings will take it up

Here we go suddenly exclaimed the captain and as he raised the
elevating rudder the big craft slowly mounted on a slant

Dick caught his breath sharply as he felt himself leaving the earth He
had once gone up in a captive balloon at a fair but then the earth
seemed sinking away beneath him This time it seemed that he was
leaving the earth behind

Higher and higher they went and Dick could feel the strong wind in his
face His eyes were protected by goggles made of celluloid to avoid
accidents from broken glass in case of a fall and on his head he wore
a heavy leather helmet not unlike those used by football players He
was strapped to his seat as were the others in case the machine
should turn turtle The straps would then prevent them from falling
out and give them a chance to right the craft

For this can be done and now some aviators practice plying upside down
to get used to doing it in case they have to by some accidental shift
of the wind Some of them can turn complete somersaults though this
is mostly done in monoplanes and seldom in a biplane which is much
more stable in the air

Feel all right asked Captain Grantly of Dick He asked this but
Dick could not hear a word on account of the great noise of the motor
But he could read the officers lip motions

Yes Im all right the young millionaire nodded back

He was surprised to find that after that first sinking sensation at
the pit of his stomach he was not afraid He now felt a glorious
sense of elation and delight

He was actually flying or the next thing to it

Well go a little higher said the captain as he elevated the rudder
a little more The aeroplane kept on ascending Dick looked down He
did not feel dizzy as he had half expected Far below him were the
buildings of Kentfield and the green parade ground But what were
those things like little ants crawling over the campus

Why the cadets of course They looked like flies or specks Dick
was ready to laugh

On a level keel they now darted ahead at greater speed as Lieutenant
Larson turned on more gasolene Then when Dick had become a little
used to the novel sensation they showed him how to work the different
levers The motor was controlled by spark and gasolene exactly as is
an automobile But there was no water radiator the engine being an
uptodate rotating one and cooling in the air The use of the
wingwarping devices by which the alerons or wingtips are warped
to allow for banking in going around a curve were also explained to
Dick by means of the levers controlling them

You know that a horse a bicyclist or a runner leans in toward the
centre of the circle in making a curve This is called banking and
is done to prevent the centrifugal force of motion from taking one off
in a straight line The same thing must be done in an airship That
is it must be inclined at an angle in making a curve

And this is accomplished by means of bending down the tips of the
planes pulling them to the desired position by means of long wires It
can also he accomplished by small auxiliary planes called alerons
placed between the two larger or main planes There is an aleron at
the end of each main wing

Straight ahead flew the army men and Dick and then when the cadet was
more used to it they went around on a sharp curve It made the young
millionaire catch his breath at first for the airship seemed to tilt
at a dangerous angle But it was soon righted and straightened out
again

Suddenly a shadow seemed to pass over Dicks head He looked up
thinking it was a dark cloud low down but to his surprise it was
the other army craft flying above them

A race thought Dick and he wondered how his chum Paul was faring

There was an impromptu race between the two aircraft and then they
separated neither one gaining much advantage Back and forth they
went over the school grounds and then in circles Dick was rapidly
acquiring knowledge of how to operate the big biplane

Well go down now spoke the captain though Dick could not hear the
words The young millionaire made up his mind that he would have a
muffler on his airship and also more room to move about He intended
to make rather a long flight

The deflecting rudder was tilted downward and the descent began They
were some distance out from the Kentfield grounds now but were headed
for them on a long slant Dick wondered if they would reach them

At a nod from the captain Lieutenant Larson reached up and shut off
the motor The sudden silence was startling

Dick understood what was to be done They were to glide or as it is
called volplane pronounced volplanay with the accent on the last
syllable to the ground

I hope we make it safely mused Dick But it did not look as though
they had been near enough the landing place when the motor was cut off
Dick saw the two army men glance rather apprehensively at one another
Was something wrong

Dick was sure of it a moment later when as Captain Grantly pulled the
lever of the deflecting rudder toward him there was a snapping
breaking sound

Lost control cried the captain Wire snapped Look out
everybody

Dick wanted to jump but he knew that would be rash as they were still
some distance above the ground

Cant you guide her asked Larson

No Weve got to land the best we can was the answer

They were right over a little farm now and seemed to be headed
directly for a small low building

Something is going to smash thought Dick grimly

The next moment the airship had come down on the roof of the low farm
building crashing right through it and a second later Dick and his
companions found themselves in the midst of a squealing lot of pigs
that fairly rushed over them



CHAPTER VIII

AT HAMILTON CORNERS

Instinctively as he felt the airship falling without being under
control Dick had loosed the strap that held him to his seat This
advice had been given as one of the first instructions to enable the
aviator to leap clear of the craft as it struck

But in this case the landing had been such a queer one that there was
no time for any of the three to do the latter Down on the roof of the
pig sty they had come crashing through it for the place was old and
rotten

It was this very fact however that saved them from more serious
injuries than severe joltings The roof had collapsed had broken in
the middle and the squealing porkers were now running wild Most of
them seemed to prefer the vicinity of the spot near where the three
aviators were now tumbled in a heap having been thus thrown by the
concussion

Get out of here you razorback cried Dick as a pig fairly walked
over him He managed to struggle to his feet but another pig took
that seemingly as an invitation to dart between the legs of the young
millionaire and upset him

Dick fell directly back on the form of Captain Grantly who grunted at
the impact Then as Lieutenant Larson tried to get up he too was
bowled over by a rush of some more pigs

But the two army officers and Dick were football players and they
knew how to take a fall so were not harmed Fortunately they had been
tossed out on a grassy part of the pen and away from the muddy slough
where the porkers were in the habit of wallowing

Get out you brutes cried Dick striking at the pigs with a part of
one of the pen roof boards Then with the army men to help him he
succeeded in driving the swine out of their way This done the
aviators looked at one another and took an account of stock

Are you hurt asked the captain of Dick grimly

No only bruised a bit As the old lady said of the train that came
to a sudden halt because of a collision do you always land this way

No indeed exclaimed the captain as he looked at the ruin of the
shed amid which the airship was This is my first accident of this
kind The lever of the vertical rudder snapped and I couldnt control
her Luckily the roof was rotten or we might have smashed everything

As it is nothing seems to be much damaged said the lieutenant I
wonder if we can fly back

It is doubtful the captain answered Well try and get her out
first

As they were climbing over the pile of broken boards to get a view of
the aeroplane an excited farmer came rushing out of a barn a short
distance away

Hey what do you fellers meansmashing down out of the clouds
bustin up my pig pen and scatterin em to the four winds he
yelled Ill have th law on you for this Ill make you pay
damages You killed a lot of my pigs I reckon

I dont see any dead ones spoke the captain calmly It was an
accident

Thats what them autermobile fellers says when they run over my
chickens snarled the unpleasant farmer But they has t pay for em
all the same

And we are willing to pay you anything in reason said the Captain
I dont believe we killed any of your pigs however But the shed was
so rotten it was ready to fall down of itself which was a good thing
for us How much do you want

Well I want a hundred dollarsthats what I want

The shed when new wasnt worth a quarter of that

I dont care snapped the farmer Thats my price Some of my pigs
may be lost for all I know and porks goin t be high this year I
want a hundred dollars or you dont take your old shebang offen my
premises Ill hold it till you pay me

The army officers looked serious at this Clearly the farmer had a
right to damages but a hundred dollars was excessive

Ill give you fifty cash said Dick as he pulled out a roll of
bills Will that satisfy you

The farmers eyes gleamed at the sight of the money And as Dick
looked at his companions he caught a greedy glint in the eyes of
Lieutenant Larson

Its wuth a hundred smashin my shed an all the trouble youve
caused me grumbled the farmer But Ill take sixty

No you wont Youll take fifty or you can bring a lawsuit replied
Dick sharply I guess you know who I am Im Hamilton from the
Kentfield Academy Colonel Masterly buys some garden stuff of you and
if I tell him

Oh shucks give me the fifty cried the farmer eagerly as he held
out his hand for the money And dont you try any more tricks like
that agin

We havent any desire to said Captain Grantly Now well see if we
can navigate

And Ive got t see if I kin get them pigs together grumbled the
farmer as he pocketed Dicks money

You can put in a requisition for this I suppose suggested the
lieutenant I dont know whether Uncle Sam ought to reimburse you or
we personally

Dont mention it exclaimed Dick Im always willing to pay for
damages though I suppose if my Uncle Ezra Larabee was here hed haggle
with that farmer and make him throw in a pig or two for luck

Who is Uncle Ezra Larabee asked the lieutenant curiously

A relative of mine answered Dick Rather close as regards money

Is he rich

Yes quite wealthy but youd never know it He lives in Dankville
and he and my dog Grit never can get along together He hates Grit and
I guess Grit doesnt love him But shall we try to get this machine
out of the shed

I guess its the best thing to do now that the pigs are out of the
way agreed the captain

And while the farmer and his hired man were chasing after the escaped
pigs the army officers and Dick began extricating the airship The
splintered boards of the pigshed were pulled to one side and then it
was seen that aside from a broken landing wheel little damage had
been done The engine was not harmed in the least and the snapped wire
that had prevented the rudder being set to make a proper landing was
easy to splice

And as weve got a spare wheel we can put that on and soon start
back said the lieutenant

Say this is getting off better than even in an automobile accident
spoke Dick with a laugh I didnt know you carried spare parts

We do the wheels as they are very light the captain said Now
lets roll her out and see what we can do

The smashed wheel was removed from the axle and the spare one
substituted The broken wire was repaired and the aeroplane was now
about the same as before It was rolled to a level place and the
motor tested It ran perfectly

The farmer having collected all his pigs and perhaps feeling joyful
because of the fifty dollars in his pocket agreed to hold back on
the craft to steady it until the necessary speed of the motor had been
attained His hired man helped him

Just as the captain was about to give the word to let go the other
airship was seen coming to look for the missing one But there was now
no need of assistance and a moment later Dick and his companions
again arose in the air

A quick return was made to the Academy those in the other airship
being informed by a signal that all was now right When the story of
the queer landing was told Dick was regarded as a hero by his
companions

Just think complained Paul whimsically your first trip and you
have an accident and you dont get so much as a scratch

Yes but I got run over and knocked down by a pig laughed Dick
Ill take the scratches please No more pigs

And after that are you still going to build an airship asked Innis

I sure am Its the greatest sensation in the worldaviation I
wouldnt miss it for a fortune And Im going to pull down that twenty
thousand dollar prize dont forget that fellows

Good luck wished Paul

In the days that followed there were many more airship flights but no
accidents of moment Dick went up again several times and at last was
allowed to run the aeroplane himself with the captain and lieutenant
to coach him Then only one officer went along another cadet being
taken up with Dick

And finally the day came when Dick was qualified to take the craft up
alone with two other cadets He had graduated as a pilot of the air
and properly proud he was of the honor

All you want now is experience said Captain Grantly as Dick came
back after a successful flight with Paul and Innis And that takes
time

Dicks two intimate chums also qualified as amateur pilots and a
number of other cadets were equally successful The aviation course at
Kentfield was very popular

Then came the end of the term and the summer vacation was at hand The
last drills and guardmounts were held The graduation exercises were
finished in a blaze of glory The Juniors gave a gay dance at which
Dick and his chums met the pretty girls whom they had seen at the dock
that day

And now for Hamilton Corners cried the young millionaire when the
Academy was formally closed for the term I want you fellows to come
out with me and watch my airship being built

Mr Vardon had found he could not build for Dick at Kentfield the craft
he wanted It would take too long and there were not the facilities
So he and his helper went to Hamilton Corners to do the preliminary
work Dick and his chums were to follow as soon as school was over
Larry Dexter went back to New York but promised to join Dick in time
for the flight for the big government prize

Well Dad how are you cried Dick as he greeted his father at the
family mansion in Hamilton Corners

Fine my boy Theres no use asking how YOU are I can see you are
fine

Did Vardon and Jack get here Have they started work Dick wanted to
know

Yes I did just as you asked me to in your letter I let them have
the run of the place and theyve been busy ever since they came I
hope you are successful Dick but I have my doubts

Ill show you cried the cadet enthusiastically



CHAPTER IX

UNCLE EZRAS VISIT

Dick and his father had much to talk about concerning the airship Dick
explained his plans and described the new stabilizer

Well now that you have explained it to me I dont see but what it
may be possible said Mr Hamilton after carefully considering the
matter It isnt so much the expense since you have your own
fortune but of course there is the element of danger to be
considered

Well theres danger in anything agreed Dick But I think I have a
lucky streak in meafter the way we came out of that pigpen
accident and he laughed

Yes you were fortunate conceded Mr Hamilton But dont take too
many risks my son Go in and win if you can but dont be rash I
am still from Missouri and youve got to show me Now Ive got a lot
of business to attend to and so Ill have to leave you to your own
devices You say Paul and Innis are coming on

Yes theyll be here in a few days and stay until the airship is
completed Then theyll fly with me

Anybody else going

Yes Larry Dexteryou remember him

Oh sure The young reporter

And I think Ill take Mr Vardon along We may need his help in an
emergency

A good idea Well I wish you luck

A large barn on the Hamilton property had been set aside for the use of
the aviator and his men for he had engaged several more besides Jack
Butt to hurry along the work on Dicks new aircraft The order had been
placed for the motor and that it was promised would be ready in time

Dick having had lunch went out to see how his airship was
progressing Grit raced here and there glad to be back home again
though he would probably miss the many horses and grooms at Kentfield
For Grit loved to be around the stables and the hostlers made much of
him

How are you coming on asked the young millionaire as he surveyed
the framework of the big craft that he hoped would carry him across
the continent and win for him the twenty thousand dollar prize

Fine Dick exclaimed Mr Vardon Everything is working out well
Come in and look You can get an idea of the machine now

Dick Hamiltons airship was radically different from any craft
previously built yet fundamentally it was on the same principle as a
biplane But it was more than three times as large as the average
biplane and was built in two sections

That is there were four sets of double planes or eight in all and
between them was an enclosed cabin containing the motor the various
controls places to sleep and eat the cabin also forming the storage
room for the oil gasolene and other supplies

This cabin was not yet built but as I have said it would be
amidship if one may use that term concerning an airship Thus the
occupants would be protected from the elements and could move about in
comfort not being obliged to sit rigidly in a seat for hours at a time

Shes going to be pretty big remarked Dick as he walked about the
skeleton of his new craft

She has to be able to carry all you want to take in her said the
aviator But shell be speedy for all of that for the engine will be
very powerful

Will she be safe asked Dick

As safe as any airship I am going to incorporate in her my gyroscope
equilibrizer or stabilizer as you suggested

Oh yes I want that said Dick in a decided tone

It is very good of you to allow me to demonstrate my patent on your
craft the inventor said It will be a fine thing for me if you win
the prize and it is known that my stabilizer was aboard to aid you
he said with shining eager eyes

Well Im only too glad I can help you in that small way spoke Dick
Im sure your patent is a valuable one

And I am now positive that it will work properly went on Mr Vardon

And Ill take precious good care that no sneak like Larson gets a
chance to tamper with it exclaimed Jack Butt

You must not make such positive statements warned his chief It may
not have been Larson

Well your machine was tampered with wasnt it just before we sank
into the river

Yes and that was what made us fall

Well Im sure Larson monkeyed with it and no one can make me believe
anything else said Jack positively If he comes around here

He isnt likely to interrupted Dick The army aviators were sent
to Texas I believe to give some demonstrations at a post there

You never can tell where Larson will turn up murmured Jack

Dick was shown the progress of the work and was consulted about
several small changes from the original tentative plans He agreed to
them and then as it was only a question of waiting until his craft
was done he decided to call on some of his friends at Hamilton Corners

Innis and Paul arrived in due season and were delighted at the sight
of Dicks big new aircraft which by the time they saw it had
assumed more definite shape Mr Vardon and his men had worked rapidly

And that cabin is where well stay is that it asked Paul as he
looked at the framework

Thats to be our quarters answered the young millionaire

Paul was looking carefully on all sides of it

Something missing asked Dick noting his chums anxiety

I was looking for the fire escape

Fire escape cried Dick What in the world would you do with a fire
escape on an airship

Well youre going to carry a lot of gasolene you say If that gets
afire well want to escape wont we I suggest a sort of rope ladder
that can be uncoiled and let down to the ground That might answer

Oh slosh cried Dick Theres going to be no fire aboard thesay
fellows I havent named her yet I wonder what Id better call her

Call her the Abaris suggested Innis though he wasnt a lady

Who was he asked Dick That name sounds well

Abaris if you will look in the back of your dictionary you will note
was a Scythian priest of Apollo said Innis with a patronizing air at
his display of knowledge He is said to have ridden through the air
on an arrow Isnt that a good name for your craft Dick

It sure is Ill christen her Abaris as soon as shes ready to
launch Good idea Innis

Oh Im full of em boasted the cadet strutting about

Youre full of conceitthats what you are laughed Paul

Suddenly there came a menacing growl from Grit who was outside the
airship shed and Dick called a warning

Whos there he asked thinking it might be a stranger

A rasping voice answered

Its me Are you there Nephew Richard I went all through the
house but nobody seemed to be home

Its Uncle Ezra whispered Dick making a pretense to faint

Ive come to pay you a little visit went on the crabbed old miser
Wheres your pa

Why hes gone to New York

Ha Another sinful and useless waste of money I never did see the
beat

He had to go on business answered Dick

Humph Couldnt he write A two cent stamp is a heap sight cheaper
than an excursion ticket to New York But Mortimer never did know the
value of money sighed Uncle Ezra

Grit growled again

Nephew Richard if your dog bites me Ill make you pay the doctor
bills warned Mr Ezra Larabee

Here Grit Quiet cried Dick and the animal came inside looking
very much disgusted

Uncle Ezra looked in at the door of the shed and saw the outlines of
the airship

What foolishness is this he asked seeming to take it for granted
that all Dick did was foolish

Its my new airship answered the young millionaire

An airship Nephew Richard Hamilton Do you mean to tell me that you
are sinfully wasting money on such a thing as thaton something that
will never go and will only be a heap of junk and Uncle Ezra of
Dankville looked as though his nephew were a fit subject for a lunatic
asylum



CHAPTER X

BUILDING THE AIRSHIP

Grit growled in a deep threatening voice and Uncle Ezra looked around
with startled suddenness

I guess Id better chain him up before I answer you said Dick
grimly Here old boy

The bulldog came unwillingly enough and was made secure

Anan airship gasped Uncle Ezra as though he could not believe it
An airship Nephew Richard It will never go You might a good deal
better take the money that you are so foolishly wasting and put it in
a savings bank Or I would sell you some stock in my woolen mill
That would pay you four per cent at least

But my airship is going to go declared the young millionaire Its
on the same model as one Ive ridden in and its going to go Were
sure of it arent we Mr Vardon

Oh it will GO all right declared the aviator Im sure of that
But I dont guarantee that youll win the prize money

Whats that Whats that asked Uncle Ezra in surprise He was all
attention when it came to a matter of money What prize did you speak
of

Didnt you hear Uncle Ezra inquired Dick Why the United States
government to increase the interest in aviation and to encourage
inventors has offered a prize of twenty thousand dollars to the first
person who takes his airship from the Atlantic to the Pacific or
rather from New York to San Francisco with but two landings Im
going to have a try for that prize

Yes and hes going to win it too cried Paul

And were at least going to share in the glory of it added Innis

Twenty thousand dollars murmured Uncle Ezra Is it possible

Oh its true enough sir put in Mr Vardon The offer has been
formally made I know several of my aviator friends who are going to
have a try for it I intended to myself but for the accident in which
my craft was smashed Only for the kindness of your nephew in engaging
me on this work I dont know what I should be doing now

Thats all right interrupted Dick who disliked praise Im doing
MYSELF as much a favor in having you build this airship as I am YOU I
intend to have a good time in this craft even if I dont win the
prize

Twenty thousand dollars murmured Uncle Ezra again slowly Its an
awful lot of moneyan awful lot he added in an awed tone of voice

The truth of the matter was that Uncle Ezra had nearly a million But
he was very close and never missed a chance to make more

And do you intend to get the government prize in thatthat
contraption he asked motioning to the halfcompleted aeroplane

Oh it isnt finished yet explained Dick

When it is it will be one of the finest aircraft in this or any
other country declared Mr Vardon I dont say that just because I
am building it but because Mr Hamilton is putting into it the very
best materials that can be bought

And we mustnt forget your stabilizer laughed Dick

Whats that Uncle Ezra wanted to know Since hearing about the
twenty thousand dollar prize his interest in airships seemed to have
increased

The stabilizer or equalibrizer whatever you wish to call it is to
keep the airship from turning over explained Mr Vardon and he went
into the details with which I have already acquainted my readers

But it is doubtful if Uncle Ezra heard or at least he paid little
attention for he was murmuring over and over again to himself

Twenty thousand dollars Twenty thousand dollars Thats an awful
lot of money IId like to get it myself

From time to time Grit growled and finally Uncle Ezra perhaps fearing
that the dog might get loose and bite him said

I think Ill go in the house for a while Nephew Richard Your father
is not likely to be home today but as I have missed the last train
back to Dankville listening to your talk about airshipsfoolish talk
it seems to meI will have to stay all night

Oh certainly exclaimed Dick remembering that he must play the
host Go right in Uncle Ezra and tell the butler to get you a lunch
Ill be in immediately

Well I could eat a little snack admitted the crabbed old man I
did think of stopping in the restaurant at the railroad depot on my way
here and getting a sandwich But the girl said sandwiches were ten
cents and they didnt look worth it to me

I asked her if she didnt have some made with stale bread that she
could let me have for five cents but she said they didnt sell stale
sandwiches She seemed real putout about it too She neednt have
Stale breads better for you than fresh anyhow

But I didnt buy one I wasnt going to throw away ten cents Thats
the interest money on a dollar for two whole years

Then he started back to the house

Isnt he the limit cried Dick in despair Hes got almost as much
money as we have and hes so afraid of spending a cent that he
actually goes hungry I believe And his housewhy hes got a fine
one but the only rooms he and Aunt Samantha ever open are the kitchen
and one bedroom I had to spend some time there once as I guess you
fellows know and saygoodnight cried Dick with a tragic gesture

He seemed interested in airships ventured Paul

It was the twenty thousand dollars he was interested in laughed
Dick I wonder if he

What asked Innis as the young millionaire paused

Oh nothing was the answer I just thought of something but its
too preposterous to mention Say Mr Vardon when do you expect our
engine

Oh in about a week now I wont be ready for it before then We can
give it a tryout on the blocks before we mount it to see if it
develops enough speed and power But have you made your official entry
for the prize yet

No and I think Id better Dick said Ill do it at once

Dick and his chums had their lunch and then went for a ride in Dicks
motorboat which had been brought on from Kentfield They had a jolly
time and later in the afternoon returned to watch the construction of
the airship

The building of the Abaris as Dick had decided to call his craft went
on apace during the days that followed Uncle Ezra was more interested
than Dick had believed possible and prolonged his stay nearly a week
He paid many visits to the airship shed

Mr Vardon and Jack his righthand man and the other workmen labored
hard The airship began to look like what she was intended for She
was of a new model and shape and seemed to be just what Dick wanted
Of course she was in a sense an experiment

The main cabin though containing the living and sleeping quarters as
well as the machinery was what most pleased Dick and his chums

Its like traveling in a firstclass motorboat only up in the
clouds instead of in the water declared Innis



CHAPTER XI

A SURPRISE

Toss over that monkey wrench will you

Say who had the saw last

I know I laid a hammer down here but its gone now

Look out there Low bridge Gangway One side

These and many other cries and calls came from the big barnlike
shed where Dick Hamiltons airship was being constructed Dick
himself and his two chums Innis Beeby and Paul Drew had joined
forces with Mr Vardon in helping on the completion of the Abaris

Weve got to get a move on Dick had said after he had sent in his
application to compete for the twenty thousand dollar government prize
We dont want to be held back at the last minute Boys weve got to
work on this airship ourselves

Were with you cried Innis and Paul eagerly

And so after some preliminary instructions from Mr Vardon the cadets
had taken the tools and started to work

It did not come so unhandily to them as might have been imagined At
the Kentfield Military Academy they had been called upon to do much
manual labor in preparation for a military life

There had been pontoon bridges to build across streams by means of
floats and boats There had been other bridges to throw across defiles
and chasms There were artillery and baggage wagons to transport along
poor roads And all this done for practice now stood Dick and his
chums in good stead

They knew how to employ their hands which is the best training in the
world for a young man and they could also use tools to advantage

So now we find Dick Paul and Innis laboring over the new airship in
which the young millionaire hoped to make a flight across the United
States from ocean to ocean

Thats what I like to see exclaimed Uncle Ezra as he came out to
the shed just before he started back for Dankville It does young men
good to work Pity more of em dont do it Hard work and plain food
is what the rising generation wants I dont approve of airshipsthat
is as a rule the crabbed old miser hastily added but of course
twenty thousand dollars is a nice prize to win I only hope you get
it Nephew Richard I like to see you work Im going back now
Ill tell your Aunt Samantha that youve at last learned how to do
something even if it is only building an airship

Dont you call my studies at Kentfield something Uncle Ezra asked
Dick

No sir No siree cried the elderly man Thats time and money
thrown away But I see that you can do manual labor Nephew Richard
and if you really want to do useful work and earn money Id be glad
to have you in my woolen mill I could start you on three dollars and
a half a week and you could soon earn more Will you come

No thank you said Dick Thank you just the same

He had a vivid idea of what it might mean to work for his Uncle Ezra
Besides Dicks fortune was such that he did not have to work But he
fully intended to and he was getting a training that would enable him
to work to the best advantage Just because he was a millionaire he
did not despise work In fact he liked it and he had made up his mind
that he would not be an idler

Just now aviation attracted him and he put in as many hours working
over his airshiphard work tooas many a mechanic might have done

Well Ill say goodbye Nephew Richard spoke Uncle Ezra after
walking about the big airship and looking at it more closely than
would seem natural after he had characterized it as a foolish piece
of business

Im sorry you wont stay until my father gets back spoke Dick I
expect him tomorrow or next day

Well if I stayed I know my hired man would waste a lot of feed on the
horses said Uncle Ezra And every time I go away he sits up and
burns his kerosene lamp until almost ten oclock at night And oil has
gone up something terrible of late

Well I hope youll come and see us again invited Dick as his uncle
started to go But wont you let me send you to the station in the
auto It isnt being used

No Nephew Richard Not for me exclaimed Uncle Ezra You might
bust a tire and then youd expect me to pay for it

Oh no I wouldnt

Well then there might be some accident and I might get my clothes
torn That would mean Id have to have a new suit Ive worn this one
five years and its good for three more if Im careful of it he
boasted as he looked down at his shiny black garments

Then youre going to walk asked Dick

Yes Nephew Richard Theres grass almost all the way to the station
and I can keep on that It will save my shoes

But people dont like you to walk on their grass objected Dick

Huh Think Im going to tramp on the hard sidewalks and wear out my
shoe leather cried Uncle Ezra I guess not

He started off trudging along with his cane but paused long enough to
call back

Oh Nephew Richard I got the cook to put me up some sandwiches I can
eat them on the train and save buying The idea of charging ten cents
in the railroad restaurant Its robbery I had her use stale bread
so that wont be wasted

Dick hopelessly shook his head He really could say nothing

His chums knew Uncle Ezras character and sympathized with their
friend

The cadets resumed work on the big airship The framework of the wings
had been completed and all that was necessary was to stretch on the
specially made canvas The cabin was nearing completion and the place
for the engine had been built The big propellers had been constructed
of several layers of mahogany and tested at a speed to which they
would never be subjected in a flight The bicycle wheels on which the
big airship would run along the ground until it had acquired momentum
for a rise were put in place

I didnt just like those hydroplanes though said Dick who had
added them as an after thought I think they should be made larger

And I agree with you said Mr Vardon The only use you will have
for the hydroplanes or wheelpontoons will be in case you are
compelled to make a landing on the water But they should be larger
or you will not float sufficiently high Make them larger But it will
cost more money

I dont mind that returned Dick Of course I am not anxious to
throw money away but I want to make a success of this and win the
prize not so much because of the cash as to show how your
equilibrizer works and to prove that it is possible to make an airship
flight across the continent

So if bigger hydroplanes are going to make it more certain for us to
survive an accident put them on

I will promised the aviator

Pontoons or hydroplanes in this case I might state were hollow
watertight wooden boxes so fitted near the wheels of the airship
that they could be lowered by levers in case the craft had to descend
on water They were designed to support her on the waves

Several days of hard work passed The aircraft was nearing completion
The cabin was finished and had been fitted up with most of the
apparatus and the conveniences for the trip There were instruments to
tell how fast the Abaris was traveling how far she was above the
earth the speed and direction of the wind and machinery and others
to predict as nearly as possible future weather conditions

In the front of the cabin was a small pilothouse in which the operator
would have his place From there he could guide the craft and control
it in every possible way

There was a sleeping cabin fitted with bunks a combined kitchen and
diningroom a small livingroom and the motorroom Of course the
latter took up the most space being the most important

In addition there was an outside platform built in the rear of the
enclosed cabin where one could stand and look above the clouds or at
the earth below

Gasolene and storage batteries furnished the power and there was
plenty in reserve Dick wanted to take no chances in his prize flight

The second day after Uncle Ezras departure the motor for the airship
arrived

Now for a test cried Dick when the machine had been uncrated and
set up on the temporary base The attachments were made an extra pair
of trial propellers connected and the power turned on

With a roar and a throb the motor started and as Mr Vardon glanced
at the test gages with anxious eyes he cried

She does better than we expected Dick We can cross the continent
with that engine and not have to make more than two stops

Are you sure asked the young millionaire

Positive was the answer

Further tests confirmed this opinion and preparations were made to
install the motor in the airship

It was while this was being done that a servant brought Dick a message

Someone has called to see you said the man

Who is it

He says his name is Lieutenant Larson formerly of the United States
Army and he has important information for you

Larson exclaimed Dick in surprise I wonder what he wants of me

Will you see him asked Paul

I suppose I had better said Dick slowly I wonder what he wants



CHAPTER XII

LARSON SEES UNCLE EZRA

Dick Hamilton had not been very friendly with Lieutenant Larson during
the aviation instruction at Kentfield In fact the young millionaire
did not like the army officer Added to this the suspicion that Larson
might have had some hand in tampering with the stabilizer of Mr
Vardons craft did not make Dick any too anxious to see the birdman

And yet he felt that in courtesy he must

Ill go in the library and meet him said Dick to the servant who
had brought the message I dont care to have him out here where he
might see my airship Dick added to his chums

I guess youre right there agreed Paul

He might take some of your ideas and make a machine for himself that
would win the prize added Innis

Oh well Im not so afraid of that replied Dick as I intend
after I complete my craft and if she wins the prize to turn my plans
and ideas over to the government anyhow for their use But I dont
just like the idea of Larson coming out to the workshed

Mr Vardon and his men were in another part of the big barn and had
not heard of the arrival of the army man

How do you do greeted Dick as he met Larson in the library Im
glad to see you

This was polite fiction that perhaps might be pardoned

I dont want to trouble you Mr Hamilton went on the lieutenant
with a shifty glance around the room but I have left the army and
have engaged in the building of airships

I recall that you said at Kentfield that you were going to construct
one and I called to see if I could not get the contract Larson went
on

Well I am sorry for your sake to say that my craft is almost
completed replied Dick So I cant give you the contract

Completed cried Larson in tones that showed his great surprise
You dont mean to tell me you have undertaken the important work of
constructing an aeroplane so soon after coming from the military
academy

Well I didnt want to waste any time replied Dick wondering at the
lieutenants interest Im going to try for the government prize and
I wanted to be early on the job

Larson hesitated a moment and resumed

Well then it is too late I suppose I hoped to get you to adopt my
plans for an aeroplane But I have been delayed making arrangements
and by resigning from the army

Perhaps I am not too late though to have you adopt my type of
equilibrizer My mercury tubes

I am sorry but you are too late there interrupted Dick

What type are you using the lieutenant cried dramatically

The Vardon I might say that Mr Vardon is also building my airship
It will contain his gyroscope

A gyroscope cried the former officer You are very foolish You
will come to grief with that The only safe form is the mercury tube
of which I am the inventor

At that moment Vardon himself who wished to consult Dick on some
point came into the room not knowing a caller was there

I am sorry went on the young millionaire but I am going to use Mr
Vardons gyroscope

Then you may as well give up all hope of winning the prize sneered
Larson You are a very foolish young man Vardon is a dreamer a
visionary inventor who will never amount to anything His gyroscope is
a joke and

I am sorry you think so interrupted the aviator But you evidently
considered my gyroscope such a good joke that you tried to spoil it

I What do you mean You shall answer for that cried the former
lieutenant in an unnecessarily dramatic manner

I think you know what I mean replied Vardon coolly I need not go
into details Only I warn you that if you are seen tampering about the
Hamilton airship on which I am working that you will not get off so
easily as you did in my case

Be careful warned Larson You are treading on dangerous ground

And so are you warned the aviator not allowing himself to get
excited as did Larson I know of what I am speaking

Then I want to tell you that you are laboring under a
misapprehension sneered the former officer I can see that I am not
welcome here Ill go

Dick did not ask him to stay The young millionaire was anything but a
hypocrite

What did he want asked Mr Vardon when Larson had left

To build my airship He evidently did not know that I had already
engaged you He got a surprise I think

He is a dangerous man and an unscrupulous one said the aviator I
do not say that through any malice but because I firmly believe it I
would never trust him

Nor shall I added Dick I presume though that he will have some
feeling against me for this

Very likely agreed Mr Vardon You will have to be on your guard

The young millionaire and the aviator then went into details about some
complicated point in the construction of the Abaris with which it is
not necessary to weary my readers

Larson must have recalled what Dick had told him about Uncle Ezra being
a wealthy man for as subsequent events disclosed the disappointed
army officer went almost at once to Dankville And there he laid
before the miserly man a plan which Uncle Ezra eventually took up
strange as it may seen

It was the bait of the twenty thousand dollar prize that took in his
case

Larson had some trouble in reaching Mr Larabee who was a bit shy of
strangers When one in this case Larson was announced by Aunt
Samantha Mr Larabee asked

Does he look like an agent

No Ez I cant say he does

Does he look like a collector

No Ez not the usual kind

Or a missionary looking for funds to buy pocket handkerchiefs for the
heathen

Hardly Hes smoking and I wish youd hurry and git him out of the
parlor for hes sure to drop some ashes on the carpet that weve had
ever since we got married

Smoking in my parlor exclaimed Uncle Ezra Ill get him out of
there The idea Why if any sun is let in there it will spoil the
colors Howd you come to open that he asked of his wife wrathfully

I didnt But I was so surprised at havin someone come to the front
door which they never do that I didnt know what to say He asked if
you was to home and I said you was Then he said Well Ill wait
for him in here and he pushed open the parlor door and went in I
had it open the least mite for I thought I saw a speck of sun comin
through a crack in the blinds and I was goin in to close it when the
bell rang

The idea Sitting in my parlor muttered Uncle Ezra Ill get him
out of that Youre sure he aint a book peddler

He dont seem to have a thing to sell except nerve said Aunt
Samantha and he sure has got plenty of that

Ill fix him cried Uncle Ezra

But he proved to be no match for the smooth sharper in the shape of
Larson

Did you want to see me demanded the crabbed old man

I did answered Larson coolly as he continued to puff away at his
cigar I came to offer you a chance to make twenty thousand dollars

Twenty thousand dollars Uncle Ezra nearly lost his breath he was
so surprised

Thats what I said Im in a position to give you a good chance to
make that much money and perhaps more If you will give me half an
hour of your time

Look here interrupted Mr Larabee this aint no lottery scheme is
it If it is I want to warn you that Im a deacon in the church I
wouldnt go into any lottery unless I was sure I could win I dont
believe in gambling As a deacon of the church I couldnt countenance
nothing like that No gambling

This is not a gamble Larson assured him Its a sure thing Ill
show you how to make twenty thousand dollars

II guess Id better open a window in here so we can see said
Uncle Ezra faintly Thats quite a pile of money to talk about in
the dark and to the horror of Aunt Samantha she saw a little later
the sun shamelessly streaming in on her carpet that had only been
treated to such indignities on the occasions of a funeral or something
like that The parlor of the Dankville house was like a tomb in this
respect



CHAPTER XIII

UNCLE EZRA ACTS QUEERLY

Exactly what passed between Uncle Ezra Larabee and his caller Aunt
Samantha never learned She was so overcome at seeing the parlor
opened that perhaps she did not listen sufficiently careful She
overheard the murmur of voices and now and then such expressions as
above the clouds in the air twenty thousand dollars and maybe
more

Gracious goodness she murmured as she hurried out to the kitchen
where she smelled something burning on the stove I wonder what its
all about Can Ezra have lost money on some of his investments If he
has if its gone up above the clouds and in the air the way hes
talking about it things will be terrible terrible It will come nigh
onto killin him I expect

She went back to listen again outside the parlor door but could make
out nothing

She did catch however her husbands expression of

Twenty thousand dollars Its a pile of money A heap

Oh my she murmured faintly If hes lost that well go to the
poorhouse sure

But nothing like that happened As a matter of fact Uncle Ezra could
have lost that sum several times over and not have felt it except in
the anguish of his mind

When the caller had gone Uncle Ezra seemed rather cheerful much to
the amazement of Aunt Samantha She could not understand it At the
same time her husband appeared to be worried about something

But he doesnt act as though he had lost a lot of money his wife
reasoned He certainly acts queer but not just that way I wonder
what it can be

And during the next week Uncle Ezra acted more queerly than ever He
received several other visits from the strange man who had given his
name to Aunt Samantha when first calling as Lieutenant Larson
Also Mr Larabee went off on several short trips

I wonder whatevers got into him mused Aunt Samantha I never knew
him to act this way before I do hope he isnt doing anything rash

If she had only known

Uncle Ezra became more and more engrossed with his caller who came
several days in succession They were shut up together in the parlor
and one window shutter was opened each time to the horror of Mrs
Larabee

That carpet will be faded all out and clean ruined she complained
to her husband

Well if it is maybe Ill get money enough to buy a new one said
Uncle Ezra Mind Im not saying for sure he added cautiously
but maybe

Why how you talk cried Aunt Samantha That carpet ought to last
us until we die A new carpet I never heard tell of such a thing
Never in all my born days The idea

Uncle Ezra chuckled grimly It was clear that he was acting in a new
role and he was a surprise even to himself

At last Aunt Samantha could stand the suspense no longer One night
after a rather restless period she awakened Uncle Ezra who had most
unusually been talking in his sleep

Ezra Ezra Wake up she demanded in a loud whisper at the same
time vigorously shaking him

Eh What is it Burglars he asked sitting up in bed

No Ezra Nothin like that

Oh cats eh Well if its only cats go to sleep I dont mind em

No Ezra I didnt say cats But youre talkin in your sleep That
is you were

I was

Yes

Whatd I say and he seemed anxious

Why you were talkin a lot about flyin in the air and goin up to
the clouds and bein in a race and winnin twenty thousand dollars
Oh Ezra if you care for me at all tell me what mystery this is she
pleaded

Did I say all that he asked scratching his head

Yes and a lot more You said something about an airship

Humph Well thats it

What is

An airship I might as well tell you I reckon Im having one of
them contraptions made

What contraptions Oh Ezra

An airship he answered Im going to have one and win a twenty
thousand dollar prize from the government Then Ill go into the
airship business and sell em Ill get rich Samantha

Oh Ezra Do you mean to say youre goin in for any such foolishness
as that

Taint foolish

Tis so Andand are youare you goin to go up in one of them
thingsthem airships

Well I reckon I might Its my machine and Im not going to let
them aviary fellers monkey too much with it unless Im on board They
might bust something and want me to pay for it Yes I reckon Ill do
some flying myself

Ezra Larabee cried his horrorstricken wife Be you plumb crazy

I hope not Samantha

But goin up in an airship Why its flyin in the face of
Providence

Well itll be flying in the air at the same time he chuckled
Clearly this was a different Uncle Ezra than his wife had ever known
She sighed

The idea Aunt Samantha murmured Goin up in an airship Youll
fall and be killed as sure as fate

Thats what I was afraid of first said Uncle Ezra and I didnt
want to go into the scheme But this young feller Lieutenant Larson
he proved to me different They cant fall If your engine stops all
you got to do is to come down like a feather He used some funny word
but I cant think of it now But its safeits safer than farming
he claims Most any time on a farm a bull may gore you or a threshing
engine blow up But theres nothing like that in an airship

Besides think of the twenty thousand dollars Im going to get he
added as a final argument

Youre not sure of it objected his wife

Oh yes I be he boasted Then Im going into the airship business
Well now Ive told you Im going to sleep again

As if anyone could sleep after hearin such news she sighed I
jest know suthin will happen And think what everybody will say about
you Theyll say youre crazy

Let em he replied tranquilly They wont say so when I get that
twenty thousand dollars

But cant you get the money any easier way she wanted to know

How Id like to know All I got to do to get this is to get an
airship to fly from New York to San Francisco

Why Ezra Larabee she exclaimed Now Im sure youre not right in
your head Youll have the doctor in the mornin

Oh no I wont he declared Dont catch me wasting any money on
doctors Im all right

How Aunt Samantha managed to get to sleep again she never knew But she
did though her rest was marred by visions of airships and balloons
turning upside down and spilling Mr Larabee all over the landscape

Mrs Larabee renewed her objections in the morning but her husband was
firm He had decided to have an airship built to compete for the big
prize and Larson was going to do the work

Just what arguments the aviator had used to win over Uncle Ezra none
but he himself knew I rather think it was the harping constantly on
the twenty thousand dollar prize

That Mr Larabee was hard to convince may easily be imagined In fact
it was learned afterward that the lieutenant almost gave up the
attempt at one time But he was persistent to gain his own ends at
least and talked earnestly Finally Uncle Ezra gave a rather grudging
consent to the scheme but he stipulated that only a certain sum be
spent and that a comparatively small one

To this the lieutenant agreed but I fancy with a mental reservation
which meant that he would get more if he could

At any rate preparations for building the craft in an unused part of
Uncle Ezras woolen mill at Dankville went on apace

I say apace and yet I must change that Uncle Ezra with his usual
closeness regarding money rather hampered Larsons plans

What do you reckon an airship ought to cost Mr Larabee had asked
when he first decided he would undertake it

Oh I can make a good one for three thousand dollars had been the
answer of the former lieutenant

Three thousand dollars whistled Uncle Ezra Thats a pot of money

But youll get twenty thousand dollars in return

Thats so Well go ahead I guess I can stand it But it was not
without many a sigh that the crabbed old man drew out the money from
the bank in small installments

The work was started but almost at once Larson demanded more than the
original three thousand Uncle Ezra went up in the air so to speak

More money he cried I shant spend another cent

But youll have to We want this airship to win the prize and get
ahead of the one your nephew is building I have decided on some
changes and they will cost money

Uncle Ezra sighedand gave in The truth was that Larson was little
better than a sharper and though he did know something about
aeroplanes he knew more about how to fleece his victims

And though Uncle Ezra furnished more money he tried to save it in other
ways He skimped on his table until even Aunt Samantha used as she
was to closeness objected Then Mr Larabee announced a cut in
wages at his factory and nearly caused a strike

But he was firm and by reducing the pittance earned by the luckless
operatives he managed to save a few hundred dollars which promptly went
into the airshipthat is what Larson did not keep for himself

But Uncle Ezras airship was being built which fact when it became
known caused much comment No one save Uncle Ezra and the lieutenant
and his workmen were allowed in the factory where the machine was
being constructed It was to be kept a secret as to the form of
construction

Meanwhile having committed himself to becoming an aviator Mr Larabee
began to study the methods of birdmen He obtained several volumes
second hand of course on the history of navigating the air and on
the advance in the construction of aeroplanes These he read
diligently

He could also have been observed going about gazing up into the
clouds as though he was calculating from how great a height a man
could fall with safety In reality he imagined he was studying air
currents

Uncle Ezra Larabee was certainly acting most queerly and his friends
or rather his acquaintances for he had no real friends did not know
what to make of him He did not give up his idea however not even
when Larson raised his original estimate to five thousand dollars

Petrified polecats cried Uncle Ezra Youll bankrupt me man

Oh no answered Larson with a winning smile This is getting off
cheap I want to increase the size of my mercury stabilizer to render
the airship more safe for you when you go after that twenty thousand
dollars

Well I spose Ive got to sighed Uncle Ezra and he made a careful
note of how much had already been spent Theres three thousand nine
hundred twentyeight dollars and fourteen cents youve had so far he
reminded the lieutenant Dont be wasteful

I wont was the promise easily given at least



CHAPTER XIV

THE TRIAL FLIGHT

All ready now take her out

Yes and look out for the side wings That doorway isnt any too
wide

No Well have to cut some off I guess

Say its big isnt it

These were the comments of Dick Hamilton and his chums as the fine new
airship the Abaris was wheeled out of the shed where it had been
constructed And certainly the young millionaire might be proud of his
newest possession Mr Vardon and his men had labored well on the
aeroplane

It was rather a tight squeeze to get the big craft out of the barn
doors wide as they were but it was successfully accomplished and the
craft now stood on a level stretch of grass ready for her first trial
flight

Save for a few small details and the stocking and provisioning of the
craft in preparation for the trip across the continent everything had
been finished The big motor had been successfully tested and had
developed even more power than had been expected The propellers
delivered a greater thrust on the air than was actually required to
send the Abaris along

Well have that for emergencies said Dick Such as getting about
in a hurricane and the like

I hope we dont get into anything like that remarked Mr Vardon
but if we do I think we can weather it

How does the gyroscope stabilizer work asked Paul who with Innis
had made Dicks house his home while the airship was being built

It does better than I expected replied the inventor I was a bit
doubtful on account of having to make it so much larger than my first
model whether or not it would operate But it does perfectlyat
least it has in the preliminary tests It remains to be seen whether
or not it will do so when were in the air but I trust it will

At any rate Larson hasnt had a chance to tamper with it said Jack
Butt grimly

No he hasnt been around agreed Dick I wonder what has become of
him

As yet the young millionaire knew nothing of the plans of his Uncle
Ezra for he had been too busy to visit his relatives in Dankville

Well lets wheel her over to the starting ground proposed Dick as
they stood around the airship A level stretch had been prepared back
of the barn leading over a broad meadow and above this the test
flight would be made as it offered many good landing places

The airship was so large and heavy as compared with the ordinary
biplane that a team of horses was used to pull it to the starting
place But heavy as it necessarily had to be to allow the enclosed
cabin to be carried the young millionaire and his aviator hoped that
the power of the motor would carry them aloft and keep them there

Go ahead cried Dick as the team was hitched to the long rope made
fast to the craft Take it easy now we dont want an accident before
we get started Grit come back here This is nothing to get excited
over for the bulldog was wildly racing here and there barking
loudly He did not understand the use of the big queerlooking
machine

Well Im just in time I see exclaimed a voice from the direction
of the house Dick turned and cried

Hello Larry old man Im glad you got here I was afraid you
wouldnt and he vigorously shook hands with the young reporter who
also greeted the other cadets Grit leaped joyfully upon him for he
and Larry were great friends

Going to take her up Dick asked Larry Dexter

Going to try was the cautious answer

Want to take a chance

I sure do It wont be the first chance Ive taken And I may get a
good story out of this Got orders from the editor not to let anything
get away from me

Well I hope you have a success to report and not a failure
remarked Paul

Same here echoed Beeby

When the airship had been hauled to the edge of the starting ground a
smooth hardpacked level space inclining slightly down grade so as
to give every advantage a careful inspection was made of every part of
the craft

As I have explained all the vital parts of the Abaris were in the
enclosed cabin a unique feature of the airship In that located
amidships was the big motor the various controls the living
sleeping and diningrooms and storage compartments for oil gasolene
and supplies Naturally there was no excess room and quarters were
almost as cramped as on a submarine where every inch counts

But there was room enough to move about and have some comfort On an
enclosed platform back of the cabin there was more space That was
like an open deck and those on it would be protected from the fierce
rushing of the air by means of the cabin This cabin I might add
was built wedgeshaped with the small part pointing ahead to cut down
the air resistance as much as possible

The big propellers were of course outside the cabin and in the rear
where was located the horizontal rudder for guiding the craft to right
or left At the rear was also an auxiliary vertical rudder for
elevating or lowering the craft The main elevation rudder was in
front and this was of a new shape never before used as far as Mr
Vardon knew

There was another feature of the Abaris that was new and one which
added much to the comfort and safety of those aboard her This had to
do with the starting of the motor and the operation of the big wooden
propellers

In most aeroplanes whether of the single or double type the
propeller or propellers are directly connected to the motor In some
monoplanes the motor especially the Gnome itself rotates carrying
the blades with it In biplanes such as the Burgess Wright or
Curtiss it is the custom to operate the propellers directly from the
motor either by means of a shaft or by sprocket chains

But in any case the starting of the engine means the whirling of the
propellers for they are directly connected This is why when once
the engine stops in midair it can not be started again Or at least
if it is started it is mostly a matter of chance in getting it to go
under compression or by the spark There is no chance for the aviator
to get out and whirl the propellers which are in a measure what a
flywheel is to an automobile

Also that is why the aviator has to be in his seat at the controls and
have some other person start his machine for him by turning over the
propeller or propellers until the motor fires

Lately however especially since the talk of the flight across the
Atlantic a means has been found to allow the aviator or some helper
with him to start the engine once it has stalled in midair This is
accomplished by means of a sprocket chain gear and a crank connected to
the engine shaft The turning handle is within reach of the aviator

But Mr Vardon and Dick working together had evolved something
better than this Of course in their craft with space to move about
in the cabin they had an advantage over the ordinary aviator who in
case of engine trouble has no place to step to to make an examination

But Dicks engine was not directly connected to the propellers There
was a clutch arrangement so that the motor could be started with the
propellers out of gear and they could be thrown in just as an
automobile is started This gave greater flexibility and also allowed
for the reversing of the propellers to make a quick stop

And it was not necessary for Dick to crank his motor An electric
selfstarter did this for him though in case of emergency the engine
could be started by hand

In fact everything aboard the Abaris was most uptodate and it was on
this that Dick counted in winning the big prize

Well I guess everything is as ready as it ever will be remarked the
young millionaire as he and the aviator made a final inspection of the
craft Get aboard fellows

Hes as cheerful about it as though he were inviting us to a hanging
laughed Paul

Oh Im not worrying about any accident said Dick quickly Im
only afraid weve made her too big and wont get any speed out of her
And speed is whats going to count in this transcontinental flight

Shell be speedy enough predicted Mr Vardon with a confident air

Paul Innis Larry and Mr Vardon entered the cabin Then Dick went
in followed by Jack Butt who remained to tighten a guy wire that was
not just to his satisfaction

Well are we all here asked Dick looking around

Yes answered Paul and there was a note of quiet apprehension in his
voice Indeed it was rather a risk they were all taking but they had
confidence in Mr Vardon

Let her go said Dick to the aviator

No you have the honor of starting her Mr Hamilton insisted Mr
Vardon motioning to the electrical apparatus

All right Here goes announced the wealthy youth as he pressed the
starting handle Everyone was on the alert but nothing happened The
motor remained dead

Whats the trouble asked Dick

Youve always got to turn that switch first before you turn the
starting handle explained Jack

Oh sure How stupid of me cried Dick And Ive started it in
practice a score of times Well now once more

This time when the switch had been thrown the motor started at once
with a throbbing roar Faster and faster it rotated until the whole
craft trembled There was considerable noise for the muffler was not
fully closed Dick wanted to warmup the machinery first

Thatll do shouted Mr Vardon who was watching the gage that told
the number of revolutions per minute Throw in your clutch

Now to see if shell rise or not murmured Dick He pulled the lever
that closed the muffler thus cutting down in a great measure the
throb of the motor Then with a look at his chums he threw in the
clutch The great propellers began to revolve and soon were flying
around on their axles with the swiftness of light

Slowly the Abaris moved forward along the ground

Were off cried Paul excitedly

Not quite yet answered Dick I want more power than weve got now

He had it almost in a moment for the airship increased her speed
across the slightly downward slope Faster and faster she rolled along
on the rubbertired wheels

Now cried Dick with his hand on the lever of the elevating rudder
Look out for yourselves fellows

He gave a backward pull A thrill seemed to go through the whole
craft Her nose rose in the air The forward wheels left the ground
Then the back ones tilted up

Up shot the Abaris at an easy angle Up and up Higher and higher

Were doing it cried Dick as he looked from the pilot house window
to the earth fast falling below him Fellows shes a success Were
going up toward the clouds



CHAPTER XV

IN DANGER

That Dick was proud and happy and that Mr Vardon and the chums of the
young millionaire were pleased with the success of the airship
scarcely need be said There was for the first few moments however
such a thrill that scarcely any one of them could correctly analyze his
feelings

Of course each one of them had been in an aeroplane before Mr Vardon
and his helper had made many flights not all of them successful and
Dick and his fellow cadets had gone up quite often though they were
as yet only amateurs Larry Dexter was perhaps less familiar with
aeroplanes than any of them but he seemed to take it as a matter of
course

Say this is great Just great cried Dick as he slipped the lever
of the elevating rudder into a notch to hold it in place He intended
going up considerably higher

It sure is great old man cried Paul I congratulate you

Oh the praise belongs to Mr Vardon said Dick modestly I
couldnt have done anything without him

And if it hadnt been for your money I couldnt have done anything
declared the aviator It all worked together

Say how high are you going to take us asked Innis

Not getting scared are you asked Dick with a glance at the
barograph to ascertain the height above the earth Were only up
about two thousand feet I want to make it three He looked at Mr
Vardon for confirmation

Three thousand wont be any too much agreed the aviator Shell
handle better at that distance or higher But until we give her a
work out its best not to get too high

The big propellers were whirling more and more rapidly as the motor
warmedup to its work The craft was vibrating with the strain of the
great power but the vibration had been reduced to a minimum by means
of special spring devices

Now well try a spiral ascent said Dick as he moved the lever of
the horizontal rudder The Abaris responded instantly and began a
spiral climb which is usually the method employed by birdmen They
also generally descend in spirals especially when volplaning

Up and up went the big aircraft There was a section of the cabin
floor made of thick transparent celluloid and through this a view
could be had of the earth below

Were leaving your place behind Dick said Paul as he noted the
decreasing size of the home of the young millionaire

Well well come back to itI hope Dick answered Dont you
fellows want to try your hand at steering

Wait until youve been at it a while and see how it goes suggested
Innis We dont want to wreck the outfit

But the Abaris seemed a stanch craft indeed especially for an airship

Say this is a heapsight better than sitting strapped in a small
seat with the wind cutting in your face exclaimed Larry as he moved
about the enclosed cabin

It sure is mighty comfortablethe last word in aeroplaning just as
Dicks touring car was in autoing declared Paul who had taken a seat
at a side window and was looking out at some lowlying clouds

All we want now is a meal and well be all to the merry Dick
exclaimed

A meal cried Larry Are you going to serve meals aboard here

Yes and cook em too answered the young millionaire Paul show
Larry where the galley is for the reporter had not called at Hamilton
Corners in some time and on the last occasion the airship had been far
from complete

Say this is great Larry cried as he saw the electrical appliances
for cooking This is the limit Im glad I came along

We wont stop to cook now said Mr Vardon I want to see the
various controls tested to know if we have to make any changes Now
well try a few evolutions

In order that all aboard might become familiar with the workings of the
machinery it was decided that there should be turn and turn about in
the matter of steering and operating the craft Reaching a height of
three thousand feet as Dick ascertained by the barograph the young
millionaire straightened his craft out on a level keel and kept her
there sending her ahead and in curves at an increasing speed

There you go now Paul he called Suppose you take her for a
while

Well if you want an accident just let me monkey with some of the
works laughed the jolly cadet I can do it to the queens taste

Youll have to go out of your way then said Mr Vardon Ive
arranged the controls so they are as nearly careless proof as possible
Just think a little bit about what you are going to do and you wont
have any trouble Its a good thing for all of you to learn to manage
the craft alone So start in

Paul found it easier than he expected and he said in spite of her
bulk that the Abaris really steered easier than one of the smaller
biplanes they had gotten used to at Kentfield

Back and forth over the fields meadows and woods in the vicinity of
Hamilton Corners the airship was taken in charge of first one and then
another of the party aboard Larry Dexter was perhaps the one least
familiar with the workings of the machine yet even he did well with
Dick and Mr Vardon at his side to coach him

Now well give the gyroscope stabilizer a test said Mr Vardon when
each including himself had had a turn I want to make sure that it
will stand any strain we can put on it

What are you going to do asked Dick

Im going to tilt the craft suddenly at an angle that would turn her
over if it were not for the stabilizer was the answer

Dick looked at the barograph or heightrecording gage It registered
thirtyeight hundred feet They had gone up a considerable distance in
making their experiments

Maybe youd better wait suggested the young millionaire pointing to
the hand of the dial until we go down a bit

No decided the aviator If shes going to work at all shell do it
up at this distance as well if not better than she would five
hundred or one hundred feet from the ground

But it might be safer began Paul

There wont be any dangerit will work Im sure of it said Mr
Vardon confidently

The gyroscope which was depended on to keep the airship on a level keel
at all times or at least to bring her back to it if she were thrown to
a dangerous angle had been set in motion as soon as the start was
made The big lead wheel with the bearings of antifriction metal was
spinning around swiftly and noiselessly Once it had been started a
small impulse from a miniature electrical motor kept it going

Now said Mr Vardon issuing his orders when I give the word I
want you all suddenly to come from that side of the cabin to this side
At the same time Dick you will be at the steering wheel and I want
you to throw her head around as if you were making a quick turn for a
spiral descent That ought to throw her nearly on her beams end and
well see how the gyroscope works That will be a good test Ill
stand by to correct any fault in the gyroscope

They were all a little apprehensive as they ranged themselves in line
near one wall of the cabin The airship tilted slightly as all the
weight came on one side just as a big excursion steamer lists to
starboard or port when the crowd suddenly rushes all to one rail But
on a steamer deck hand are kept in readiness with barrels of water
and these they roll to the opposite rail of the boat thus preserving
the balance

Mr Vardon depended on the gyroscope to perform a like service for the
airship and to do it automatically

The aviator waited a few moments before giving the order to make the
sudden rush Already the apparatus to which was contrasted Lieutenant
Larsons mercury tubes had acted and the Abaris which had dipped
when all the passengers collected on one side had now resumed her
level keel again showing that the gyroscope had worked so far at any
rate

Now well give her a trial called Mr Vardon All ready come over
on the run and throw her around Dick

On the run they came and Dick whirled the steering wheel around to the
left to cause the Abaris to swerve suddenly

And swerve she did With a sickening motion she turned as a vessel
rolls in a heavy sea and at the same moment there was a dip toward
the earth The motor which had been humming at high speed went dead on
the instant and Dick Hamiltons airship plunged downward



CHAPTER XVI

DICK IS WARNED

Whats the matter

What happened

Were falling

Somebody do something

Everyone seemed talking at once calling out in fear and looking
wildly about for some escape from what seemed about to be a fatal
accident For the Abaris was over half a mile high and was shooting
toward the earth at a terrific rate

Wait Quiet everybody called Dick who had not deserted his post
at the steering wheel Ill bring her up Well volplane down
Itll be all right

His calmness made his chums feel more secure and a glance at Mr
Vardon and his machinist aided in this For the veteran aviator after
a quick inspection of the machinery no longer looked worried

What has happened asked Innis

Our engine stalled for some unknown reason answered Mr Vardon
quickly Fortunately nothing is broken Ill see if I cant start it
with the electrical generator Are you holding her all right Dick

I think so yes I can take four or five minutes more to let her down
easy

Well take all the time you can Head her up every once in a while
It will be good practice for you The stabilizer worked all right
anyhow

The airship was not on a level keel but was inclined with her bow
pointed to the earth going downward on a slant But Dick knew how to
manage in this emergency for many times he had practiced volplaning to
earth in ordinary biplanes

By working the lever of the vertical rudder he now brought the head
or bow of the airship up sharply and for a moment the downward plunge
was arrested The Abaris shot along parallel to the plane of the
earths surface

This operation repeated until the ground is reached is as I have
already explained called volplaning

Something is wrong announced Mr Vardon as he yanked on the lever
of the starting motor and turned the switch Only the hum of the
electrical machine resulted The gasolene motor did not pick up
though both the gasolene and spark levers were thrown over

Never mind counseled Dick I can bring her down all right Theres
really nothing more the matter than if we had purposely stopped the
motor

No thats so agreed Mr Vardon But still I want to see what the
trouble is and why it stopped Ill try the hand starter

But this was of no use either The gasolene motor would not start and
without that the propellers could not be set in motion to sustain the
big craft in the air Mr Vardon and his helper with the aid of
Innis Paul and Larry worked hard at the motor but it was as
obstinate as the engine of some stalled motorboat

I cant understand it said the aviator

Theres plenty of gasolene in the tank and the spark is a good fat
one But the motor simply wont start How you making out Dick

All right Were going to land a considerable distance from home but
maybe we can get her started when we reach the ground

Well try anyhow agreed the aviator Is she responding all right

Fine Couldnt be better Let some of the other boys take a hand at
it

Well maybe it would be a good plan agreed the aviator You never
can tell when youve got to make a glide Take turns boys

I dont think Id better until I learn how to run an airship that
isnt in trouble said Larry Dexter

Well perhaps not said Mr Vardon But the others may

Meanwhile the Abaris had been slowly nearing earth and it was this
slowness caused by the gradual sifting down that would make it
possible to land her with scarcely a jar

If you have ever seen a kite come down when the wind has died out you
will understand exactly what this sifting is It means gliding
downward in a series of acute angles

The first alarm over all was now serene aboard Dicks airship The
attempt to start the motor had been given up and under the supervision
of Mr Vardon the two cadets Innis and Paul took turns in bringing
the craft down with the engine dead The aviator and his helper had
had experience enough at this

Say this is something new guiding as big a ship as this without
power remarked Innis as he relinquished the wheel to Paul

It sure is said tile latter Then a little later he called out

I say somebody relieve me quick I believe Im going to bring her
down in that creek

They all looked ahead and downward The Abaris surely enough was
headed for a stream of water

Perhaps youd better handle her said Dick to the builder of the
craft We dont want her wrecked before we at least have a START
after that prize

Mr Vardon nodded and took the wheel from Paul A few seconds later
he had brought the craft to the ground within a few feet of the edge of
the stream Had it been a wider and deeper one they could have landed
on it by using the hydroplanes but the water seemed too shallow and
full of rocks for that evolution

And so skillfully had Mr Vardon manipulated the planes and levers that
the landing was hardly felt A number of speciallymade springs took
up the jar

Well were here exclaimed Dick as they all breathed in relief
Now to see what the trouble was

And weve got a long walk back home in case we cant find the
trouble sighed Innis for he was rather stout and did not much enjoy
walking They had come down several miles from Hamilton Corners

Oh well get her fixed up somehow declared Dick with confidence

Quite a throng had gathered from the little country hamlet on the edge
of which the aircraft had descended and they crowded up about the
Abaris looking in wonder at her size and strange shape

Mr Vardon lost no time in beginning his hunt for the engine trouble
and soon decided that it was in the gasolene supply since though the
tank was nearly full none of the fluid seemed to go into the
carburetor

Theres a stoppage somewhere the aviator said The fluid was drawn
off into a reserve tank and then the cause of the mischief was easily
located

A small piece of cotton waste had gotten into the supply pipe and
completely stopped the flow of gasolene

There it is cried the aviator as he took it out holding it up for
all to see

I wonder if anyone could have done that on purpose asked Dick
looking at his chums reflectively

You meanLarson inquired Jack Butt Hes capable of anything like
that

But he wasnt near the machine said Paul

Not unless he sneaked in the barn some night went on the machinist
who seemed to have little regard for the former lieutenant

Well theres no way of telling for certain so we had better say
nothing about it decided Dick Then too any of us might have
accidentally dropped the waste in the tank while we were working around
the ship I guess well call it an accident

But it must have been in the tank for some time argued Larry Dexter
and yet it only stopped up the pipe a little while ago

It was probably floating around in the tank doing no damage in
particular explained Mr Vardon Then when we made the ship tilt
that way to test the stabilizer the gasolene shifted and the waste
was flushed into the pipe But were all right now

This was proved a little later when the motor was started with no
trouble whatever There was not a very good place to make a start
along the edge of the stream but Dick and his chums realized that they
could not always have perfect conditions so they must learn to do
under adverse ones

Look out of the way warned the young millionaire to the assembled
crowd They scattered from in front of the craft The motor throbbed
and thundered up to high speed and then the propellers were thrown
into gear The big blades beat on the air the ship moved slowly
forward It acquired speed and then amid the wondering comments and
excited shouts of the crowd it soared aloft and glided through the
air to a great height

Off again cried Dick who was at the wheel

The trip back to Hamilton Corners was made safely and without incident
worthy of mention The four young men took turns in working the
various controls so as to become familiar with them and Dick paid
particular attention to Larry Dexter who needed some coaching

Ill get a good story out of this for my paper said the young
reporter who was always on the lookout for copy

Well weve proved that she will fly and take care of us even when an
accident happens remarked Dick when the craft had been put back in
the barn Now well groom her a bit put on the finishing touches
and well be ready to try for that prize The time is getting short
now

I hope you win it said Mr Vardon I shall feel responsible in a
way if you dont

Nothing of the sort cried Dick Whatever happens Ive got a fine
airship and well have a good time even if we dont get the twenty
thousand dollars

The next week was a busy one for there were several little matters
about the airship that needed attention But gradually it was made as
nearly perfect as possible

Then one morning Mr Hamilton who had some business to transact with
Uncle Ezra said to Dick

Could you take a run over there and leave him these securities He
asked me to get them for him out of the safe deposit box I dont know
what he wants of them but they are his and I have no time to take
them to him myself You can go in your airship if you like and give
him a surprise

No I think Ill go in the auto Mr Vardon is making a change in the
motor and it isnt in shape to run today Ill take the boys over to
Dankville in the small car

A little later Dick and his chums were on their way to Uncle Ezras
They reached Dankville in good time but on calling at the house Aunt
Samantha told them her husband was at the woolen mill

Well go down there and see him decided Dick after talking to his
aunt a little while She had been looking in the parlor to see that
by no chance had a glint of light gotten in Of late her husband and
his airshippartner Larson had not used the best room and so Aunt
Samanthas fears about the carpet being spoiled by cigar ashes had
subsided

At the factory Dick was directed by a foreman to an unused wing of
the building

Youll find your uncle in there the man said to Dick Hes
building an airship

A what cried the young millionaire in great astonishment for he had
been too busy of late to hear any news from Dankville

An airshipa biplane I believe theyre called the foreman went on

Well Ill be gumswizzled cried Dick faintly Come on fellows
The world must be coming to an end surely

As he started to enter the part of the factory whither he had been
directed his uncle plainly much excited came out

Stop where you be Nephew Richard he warned Dont come in here
Stay back

Why what in the world is the matter asked Dick Is something
going to blow up



CHAPTER XVII

OFF FOR THE START

Uncle Ezra Larabee stood fairly glaring at his nephew The crabbed old
man seemed strangely excited

No there aint nothing going to blow up he said after a pause
But dont you come in here I warn you away You can go in any other
part of my factory you want to but not in here

Well I certainly dont want to come where Im not wanted Uncle
Ezra said Dick with dignity But I hear you are building an
airship and I thought Id like to get a look at it

And thats just what I dont want you to getnone of you went on
Mr Larabee looking at Dicks chums I dont want to be mean to my
dead sisters boy he added but my airship aint in shape yet to be
inspected

Well if it isnt finished perhaps we can give you some advice said
Dick with a smile

Huh I dont want no advice thank you said Uncle Ezra stiffly I
calkerlate Lieutenant Larson knows as much about building airships as
you boys do

Larson cried Dick Is he here

He certainly is and hes working hard on my craft Im going to be
an aviator and win that twentythousanddollar government prize Mr
Larabee said as though it were a certainty

Whew whistled Dick Then well be rivals Uncle Ezra

Humph Maybe you might think so but Ill leave you so far behind
that you wont know where you are boasted the crabbed old man

Building an airship eh mused Dick Well thats the last thing
Id ever think of Uncle Ezra doing Then to his relative he added
But if youre going to compete for the prize your airship will have to
be seen Why are you so careful about it now

Because weve got secrets about it replied Mr Larabee Theres
secret inventions on my airship that havent been patented yet and I
dont want you going in there Nephew Richard and taking some of my
builders ideas and using em on your airship I wont have it Thats
why I wont let you in Im not going to have you taking our ideas
not by a jugful

Theres no danger answered Dick quietly though he wanted to laugh
My airship is all finished Weve used her and shes all right I
wouldnt change her no matter what I saw on yours

Waal you might think so now but I cant trust nobodynot even you
so you cant come in said Uncle Ezra

Oh we wont insist answered Dick as he passed over the bonds
Father said you wanted these Uncle Ezra

Yes I do and an expression as of pain passed over the mans face
Ive got to raise a little money to pay for this airship Its costing
a terrible pile a terrible pile and he sighed in despair But
then of course Ill get the twenty thousand dollars and that will
help some After that Im going to sell plans and models of my
successful airship and Ill make a lot more that way So of course
Ill get it all back

But its costing me a terrible pile Why would you believe it he
said looking around to see that the door to the factory was securely
closed would you believe Ive already spent five thousand six
hundred twentyseven dollars and fortynine cents on this airship And
it aint quite done yet Its a pile of money

Yes they are expensive but theyre worth it said Dick Its
great sportflying

It may be Ive never tried it but Im going to learn declared
Uncle Ezra Only I didnt think it would cost so much or I never
would have gone into it But now Im in I cant get out without losing
all the money Ive put up and I cant do that I never could do
that said Uncle Ezra with a doleful shake of his head

He gave a sudden start at some noise and cried out

Whats that You didnt dare bring your bulldog in here did you
Nephew Richard If you did Ill

No I left Grit at home Uncle Ezra

Then the noise was repeated It came from the part of the factory
where the airship was being constructed and was probably made by some
of the workmen

I guess Ill have to go now said Mr Larabee and this was a hint
for the boys to leave

Lieutenant Larson said he wanted to consult with me about something
I only hope he doesnt want more money he added with a sigh But he
spends a terrible pile of casha terrible pile

Yes and hell spend a lot more of your cash before he gets through
with you if Im any judge thought Dick as he and his chums went
back to the automobile To think of Uncle Ezra building an airship
Thats about the limit

Do you really think he is going to have a try for the government
prize asked Larry Dexter

Well stranger things have happened admitted the young millionaire

Youre not worrying though are you asked Paul

Not a bit I imagine Ill have to compete with more formidable
opponents than Uncle Ezra But I do give Larson credit for knowing a
lot about aircraft I dont believe though that his mercury
stabilizers are reliable Still he may have made improvements on them
Id like to get a look at Uncle Ezras machine

And he doesnt want you to laughed Innis Hes a queer man
keeping track of every cent

Oh it wouldnt be Uncle Ezra if he didnt do that returned Dick
with a grin

There were busy days ahead for the young millionaire and his chums
Though the Abaris seemed to have been in almost perfect trim on her
trial trip it developed that several changes had to be made in her
Not important ones but small ones on which the success or failure
of the prize journey might depend

Dick and his friends worked early and late to make the aircraft as
nearly perfect as possible

Dicks entry had been formally accepted by the government and he had
been told that an army officer would be assigned to make the
transcontinental flight with him to report officially on the time and
performance of the craft For the government desired to establish the
nearest perfect form of aeroplane and it reserved the right to
purchase the patent of the successful model

And it is on that point that more money may be made than by merely
winning the prize said Mr Vardon We must not forget that so we
want everything as nearly right as possible

And to this end they worked

Youre going to take Grit along arent you asked Paul of Dick one
day as they were laboring over the aircraft putting on the finishing
touches

Oh sure exclaimed the young millionaire I wouldnt leave him
behind for anything

I wonder what army officer theyll assign to us remarked Innis I
hope we get some young chap and not a grizzled old man wholl be a
killjoy

Its bound to be a young chap because none of the older men have
taken up aviation said Larry I guess well be all right Ill see
if I cant find out from our Washington reporter who it will be

But he was unable to do this as the government authorities themselves
were uncertain

The time was drawing near when Dick was to make his start in the
crosscountry flight with but two landings allowed between New York
and San Francisco Nearly everything was in readiness

Mr Vardon said Dick one day this business of crossing a continent
in an airship is a new one on me Ive done it in my touring car but
I confess I dont see how were going to keep on the proper course up
near the clouds with no landmarks or anything to guide us

But Im going to leave all that to you Were in your hands as far as
that goes Youll have to guide the craft or else tell us how to
steer when it comes our turn at the wheel

I have been studying this matter the aviator replied I have made
several long flights but never across the continent But I have
carefully charted a course for us to follow As for landmarks the
government has arranged that

Along the course in as nearly as possible a beeline from New York to
San Francisco there will be captive balloons painted white for day
observation and arranged with certain colored lanterns for
nightsighting Then too there will be pylons or tall towers of
wood erected where there are no balloons So I think we can pick our
course Dick

Oh I didnt know about the balloon marks said the young
millionaire Well Ill leave the piloting to you I think you know
how to do it

Several more trial flights were made Each time the Abaris seemed to
do better She was more steady and in severe tests she stood up well
The gyroscope stabilizer worked to perfection under the most
disadvantageous conditions

Several little changes were made to insure more comfort for the
passengers on the trip Dicks undertaking had attracted considerable
attention as had the plans of several other and betterknown
aviators to win the big prize The papers of the country were filled
with stories of the coming event but Larry Dexter had perhaps the best
accounts as he was personally interested in Dicks success

Dick paid another visit to Uncle Ezra and this time his crabbed
relative was more genial He allowed his nephew to have a view of the
craft Larson was building The former lieutenant greeted Dick coldly
but our hero thought little of that He was more interested in the
machine

Dick found that his uncle really did have a large and apparently very
serviceable biplane Of course it was not like Dicks as it designed
to carry but three passengers

Were going to make the trip in about fortyeight hours so we wont
need much space said Uncle Ezra We can eat a snack as we go along
And we can sleep in our seats Ive got to cut down the expense
somehow Its costing me a terrible pile of money

Uncle Ezras airship worked fairly well in the preliminary trials and
though it did not develop much speed Dick thought perhaps the crafty
lieutenant was holding back on this so as to deceive his competitors

But barring accidents we ought to win said the young millionaire
to his chums And accidents no one can count against

Everything was in readiness The Abaris had been given her last trial
flight All the supplies and stores were aboard Jack Butt had taken
his departure for he was not to make the trip His place would be
taken by the army lieutenant A special kennel had been constructed
for Grit who seemed to take kindly to the big airship

Well the officer will be here in the morning announced Dick one
evening on receipt of a telegram from Washington Then well make
the start

And what was the surprise of the young millionaire and his chums to
be greeted early the next day by Lieutenant McBride the officer who
had with Captain Wakefield assisted in giving instructions at
Kentfield

I am surely glad to see you cried Dick as he shook hands with him
Theres nobody Id like better to come along

And theres nobody Id like better to go with said the officer with
a laugh I was only assigned to you at the last minute First I was
booked to go with a man named Larabee

Hes my uncle Im glad you didnt chuckled Dick Then he told
about Larson and Lieutenant McBride himself was glad also

In order to be of better service in case of an emergency Lieutenant
McBride asked that he be taken on a little preliminary flight before
the official start was made so that he might get an idea of the
working of the machinery

This was done and he announced himself as perfectly satisfied with
everything

You have a fine craft he told Dick The best I have ever seen and
Ive ridden in a number You ought to take the prize

Thanks laughed the young millionaire

Of course Im not saying that officially warned the officer with a
smile Ill have to check you up as though we didnt know one other
And I warn you that youve got to make good

I wouldnt try under any other conditions replied Dick

The last tuningup of the motor was over The last of the supplies and
stores were put aboard Grit was in his place and the crosscountry
fliers in theirs Goodbyes were said and Mr Hamilton waved the
Stars and Stripes as the cabin door was closed

All ready asked Dick who was the captain of the aircraft

All ready answered Lieutenant McBride

All ready agreed Mr Vardon

Then here we go cried Dick as he pulled the lever The airship was
on her way to the starting point



CHAPTER XVIII

UNCLE EZRA FLIES

Well Mr Larabee we are almost ready for a flight

Humph Its about time Ive sunk almost enough money in that
shebang to dig a gold mine and I havent got any out yetnot a cent
and Im losing interest all the while

Well but think of the twenty thousand dollars

Yes I spose Ive got to Thats the only consolation I have left

The above conversation took place one afternoon between Ezra Larabee
and Lieutenant Larson The airship with the mercury stabilizers was
nearly completed But a few touches remained to be put on her to make
her according to Larson ready for the flight across the continent

I presume you will go with me when me make the first ascent will you
not the lieutenant inquired

Who me No I dont reckon Ill go up first said Uncle Ezra
slowly Ill wait until I see if you dont break your neck If you
dont Ill take a chance

Thats consoling was the answer with a grim laugh But I am not
afraid I know the craft will fly You will not regret having
commissioned me to build her

Waal I should hope not said Uncle Ezra dryly So far Ive put
eight thousand four hundred thirtytwo dollars and sixteen cents into
this shebang and I aint got a penny out yet It just seems to chaw
up money

They all do said the lieutenant It is a costly sport But think
of the twentythousanddollar prize

I do said Uncle Ezra softly Thats all that keeps me from
thinking what a plumb idiot Ive beenthinking of that twenty thousand
dollars

Oh youll get it the lieutenant asserted

Maybeyes If my nephew doesnt get ahead of me was the grim reply

Oh he never will Well win that prize the lieutenant assured him
Now theres one other little matter I must speak of I need some more
money

More money Good land man I gave you three dollars and a half last
week to buy something cried Uncle Ezra

Yes I know but that went for guy wires and bolts I need about ten
dollars for an auxiliary steering wheel

A steering wheel questioned Uncle Ezra You mean a wheel to twist

Thats it There must be two We have only one

Well if its only a wheel I can fix you up about that all right and
without spending a cent either exclaimed the stingy old man with a
chuckle Theres an old sewing machine of my wifes down cellar
Its busted all but the big wheel We had an accident with it but I
made the company give me a new machine and I kept the old one

Now thats got a big round iron wheel on it and we can take that
off just as well as not and use it on the airship Thats what
youve got to do in this worldsave money Ive spent a terrible
pile but well save some by using the sewing machine wheel

It wont do said the lieutenant Its far too heavy I must have
one made to order of wood It will cost ten dollars

Oh dear groaned Uncle Ezra More money and he looked
distressed Then his face brightened

I say he cried Theres a busted mowing machine out in the barn
Thats got a wooden wheel on it Cant you use that

Lieutenant Larson shook his bead

Its no use trying to use makeshift wheels if we are to have a
perfect machine and win the prize he said I must have the proper
one I need ten dollars

Oh dear moaned Uncle Ezra as he took out his wallet and carefully
counted out ten onedollar bills

Couldnt you look around and get a secondhand one he asked
hopefully

No we havent time We must soon start on the prize trip We dont
want to be late

No I spose not Waal take the money and he parted with it
after a long look Then he made a memoranda of it in his pocket
cashbook and sighed again

Several times after this Lieutenant Larson had to have more moneyor
at least he said he needed it and Uncle Ezra brought it forth with
many sighs and groans But he gave up

To give Larson credit he had really produced a good aircraft Of
course it was nothing like Dicks and after all the former army man
was more interested in his stabilizers than he was in the airship
itself But he had to build it right and properly to give his patent a
good test and he used his best ideas on the subject

In general Uncle Ezras machine was a biplane a little larger than
usual and with a sort of auxiliary cabin and platform where one could
rest when not in the seats Three passengers could be carried
together with some food and supplies of gasolene and oil It was an
airship built for quick continuous flight and it really had a chance
for the prize perhaps not as good a chance as had Dicks but a good
chance compared with others in its class The one weak point and this
Lieutenant Larson kept to himself was the fact that it was only with
the best of luck that the flight could be made with but two landings

Finally the former army man announced that the craft was ready for a
flight He had spent all the money Uncle Ezra would give himnearly
ten thousand dollarsand I suspect that Larson himself had lined his
own pockets well

Shes ready he announced to Uncle Ezra one day

Well take her up

Will you come

Not till I see how you fare Go ahead

Ezra be you goin up in that contraption asked Aunt Samantha as
she came out in the meadow where a starting ground had been laid out

Im aiming to if he comes back alive with it Uncle Ezra made
answer grimly

Well as I said before its flyin in the face of Providence
declared Mrs Larabee I might as well order my mourning now and be
done with it

Oh I aint aiming to be killed chuckled Uncle Ezra I guess its
safe enough Ive got to get my money back out of this thing

Lieutenant Larson with one of the helpers made the first flight He
did not go very high so that Uncle Ezra would have confidence When he
came back to the starting point he asked

Well will you take a chance

II guess so replied Mr Larabee and his voice was not very steady

Im goin in the house announced Mrs Larabee I dont want to see
it

Uncle Ezra took his place

Ive got accident insurance in case anything happens he said slowly

I dont believe your policy covers airship flights the lieutenant
returned

Then let me out cried Uncle Ezra Ill have the policy changed
Im not going to take any such chances

Its too late cried Larson Here we go The engine was
thundering away and a moment later the craft shot over the ground and
into the air Uncle Ezra was flying at last



CHAPTER XIX

UNCLE EZRAS ACCIDENT

For some seconds after he had been taken up in the atmosphere in his
airship Uncle Ezra said nothing He just sat there in the padded
seat clutching with his hands the rails in so tight a grip that his
knuckles showed white

Up and up they went Larson skillfully guiding the craft until they
were a considerable distance above the earth

Thatsthats far enough Uncle Ezra managed to yell above the
throb of the now throttleddown motor Dont goany higher

All right agreed the aviator But shell work easier up a little
more

Noitits too farto fall said Mr Larabee and he could not
keep his voice from trembling

Really though he stood it bravely though probably the thought of all
the money he had invested in the craft as well as the prize he was
after buoyed up his spirits

How do you like it asked Larson when they had circled around over
Mr Larabees extensive farm for some time

Its different from what I expected remarked Uncle Ezra But it
seems good I dont know as Ill stand it all the way to San
Francisco though

Oh yes you will asserted Larson Youll get used to it in time

Is she working all right Lieutenant Larson

Yes pretty well I see a chance to make one or two changes though
that will make her better

Does that meanermore money was Uncle Ezras anxious question

Well some yes

Not another cent burst out the crabbed old man I wont spend
another cent on her Ive sunk enough money in the old shebang

Larson did not answer He simply tilted the elevating rudder and the
biplane poked her nose higher up into the air

Here What you doing demanded Uncle Ezra

Im going up higher

But I tell you I dont want to I want to go down This is high
enough and Uncle Ezra fairly screamed

Weve got to go higher said Larson The carburetor isnt working
just right at this low elevation Thats what I wanted the extra money
for to get a new one But of course if you feel that you cant spare
it why well simply have to fly higher thats all The carburetor
we have will work all right at a high elevation on account of the
rarefied air but with a different one of course we could stay
lowerif we wanted to

Still if you feel you cant afford it he went on with a sly look
at the crabbed old man who sat there clutching the sides of the seat
well have to do the best we can and make this carburetor do I
guess well have to keep on a little higher he added as he glanced
at the barograph

Say Hold on yelled Uncle Ezra in his ear Youyou can have that
money for the carburetor Go on down where we were before

Oh all right assented Larson and he winked the eye concealed from
his employer

The aircraft went down and flew about at a comparatively low
elevation Really there did not seem to be much the matter with the
carburetor but then of course Larson ought to know what he was
talking about

Shes working pretty goodall except the carburetor said the former
army man after they had been flying about fifteen minutes The motor
does better than I expected and with another passenger well be
steadier She needs a little more weight Do you want to try to steer
her

No sir Not yet cried Uncle Ezra I can drive a mowingmachine
and a thresher but Im not going to try an airship yet I hired you
to run her All I want is that twentythousanddollar prize and the
chance to sell airships like this after weve proved them the best for
actual use

And we can easily do that declared Larson My mercury stabilizer
is working to perfection

When can we start on the race Mr Larabee wanted to know

Oh soon now You see it isnt exactly a race That is the competing
airships do not have to start at the same time

No questioned Uncle Ezra

No You see each competing craft is allowed to start when the pilot
pleases provided an army officer is aboard during the entire flight to
check the results and the time consumed Two landings will be
allowed and only the actual flying time will be counted

That is if the trip is finished within a certain prescribed time I
think it is a month In other words we could start now fly as far as
we could and if we had to come down because of some accident or to
get supplies we could stay down several days Then we could start
again and come down the second time But after that we would be
allowed no more landings and the total time consumed in flying would
be computed by the army officer

Oh thats the way of it asked Uncle Ezra

Yes and the craft that has used the smallest number of hours will win
the prize went on Larson Im sure we can do it for this is a fast
machine I havent pushed her to the limit yet

And dont you do itnot until I get more used to it stipulated the
owner of the airship

The former army officer sent the aircraft through several simple
evolutions to test her She answered well though Uncle Ezra gasped
once or twice and his grip on the seat rail tightened

When do you plan to start Mr Larabee wanted to know again

Oh in about a week I have sent in an application to have a
representative of the government assigned to us and when he comes
well start That will give me a chance to buy the new carburetor and
make some other little changes

Well lets go down now suggested Uncle Ezra Hello whats this
he cried looking at his coat Why Im all covered with oil

Yes it does drip a little admitted the aviator I havent
tightened the washers on the tank You mustnt mind a little thing
like that I often get soaked with oil and gasolene I should have
told you to put on an old suit

But look here cried Uncle Ezra in accents of dismay I didnt put
on an old suit This is my second best I paid thirteen dollars for
it and Ive bad it four years It would have been good for two more
if your old oil hadnt leaked on it Now its spoiled

You can have it cleaned perhaps suggested the lieutenant as he sent
the biplane about in a graceful curve before getting ready for a
descent

Yes and maybe have to pay a tailor sixtyfive cents Not much
cried Uncle Ezra Ill clean it myself with some of the gasolene I
aint going to waste money that way I ought to charge you for it

Well Ill give you the gasolene to clean it said the aviator with
another unseen wink

Humph ejaculated Uncle Ezra with a grunt as he tried to hold on
with one hand and scrub off some of the oil spots with his
handkerchief

Well I guess well go down now announced Larson after making
several sharp ascents and descents to test the efficiency of the
vertical rudder

Why were quite a way from the farm exclaimed Mr Larabee looking
down I didnt think wed come so far

Well Ill show you how quickly we can get back there boasted
Larson Ill have you at your place in a hurry

He turned more power into the motor and with a rush and a roar the
biplane shot forward

But something happened Either they struck an air pocket or the
rudder was given too sudden a twist Anyway the airship shot toward
the ground at a sharp angle She would have crashed down hard only
Larson threw her head up quickly checking in a measure the momentum

But he could not altogether control the craft and it swept past a tree
in an orchard where they were forced to land the side wing tearing off
the limbs and branches

Then bouncing down to the ground the airship tilted on one end and
shot Uncle Ezra out with considerable force He landed in a heap of
dirt turned a somersault and sat up with a queer look on his face



CHAPTER XX

IN NEW YORK

Well this is going some

I should say yes

All to the merry

And no more trouble than as if you got in a taxicab and told the
chauffeur to take you around the block

Thus did Dick Hamiltons chums offer him their congratulations as they
started off on the trip they hoped would bring to the young millionaire
the twentythousanddollar prize and not only do that but establish a
new record in airship flights and also give to the world the benefit
of the experience in building such a unique craft

They were in the Abaris flying along over the town of Hamilton Corners
a most successful start having been made As they progressed through
the air many curious eyes were turned up to watch their flight

I say Which way are you steering asked Paul as he came back from
a trip to the diningroom buffet where he had helped himself to a
sandwich a little lunch having been set out by Innis who constituted
himself as cook Youre heading East instead of West Dick for the
young millionaire was at the steeringwheel

I know it replied the helmsman as he noted the figures on the
barograph But you see to stand a chance for the prize youve got to
start from New York and thats where were headed for now Weve got
to go to the big town first and then well hit the Western trail as
nearly in a straight line as we can

Thats the idea said Lieutenant McBride The conditions call for a
start from New York and I have arranged for the beginning of your
flight from the grounds at Fort Wadsworth That will give the army
officers there a chance to inspect your machine Mr Hamilton

And Ill be very glad to have them see it Dick said and to offer
their congratulations to Mr Vardon on his success

And yours too added the aviator I couldnt have done anything
had it not been for you

Then we really arent on the prize winning flight yet asked Larry
who wanted to get all the information he could for his paper

Not exactly replied the lieutenant And yet the performance of the
airship will count on this flight in a measure I have been
instructed to watch how she behaves and incorporate it in my report
It may be Mr Hamilton though I hope not that the prize will not
come to you But you may stand a chance of having your airship adopted
by Uncle Sam for all that

That would be a fine feather in my cap cried Dick I dont care so
much for the money I guess you all know that

I should say not cried Innis with a laugh

Any fellow whos worth a million doesnt have to bother about a little
small change like twenty thousand dollars

Not that I havent a due regard for the prize went on Dick But if
I lost it and still could have the honor of producing an airship that
would be thought worthy of government approval that would be worth
while

Indeed it would agreed the lieutenant

Are we going to have any time at all in New York asked Paul I
have some friends there and

I believe her name is Knox isnt it interrupted Innis with a grin
at his chum First name Grace lives somewhere up in Central Park
West eh old chap

Oh dry up invited Paul Dont you spose Ive got any friends but
girls

Well Grace does live in New York insisted Innis

Yes and so do Irene Martin and Mabel Hanford burst out Paul Its
as much on you fellows as it is on me and he fairly glared at his
tormentor

Easy laughed Dick I guess we may as well make a family party of
it while were about it Of course well see the girls In fact I
halfpromised Miss Hanford Id call on her if I could get my airship to
work

Oh you sly dog mocked Innis And you never said a word

I didnt know I could get it to work laughed Dick as he stood at
the wheel

The Abaris was cleaving through the clear air at a fast rate of speed
though she was not being sent along at her limit The aviator wanted
to test his machinery at moderate speed for some time before he turned
on full power and this trip to New York for the start gave him the
very chance wanted

It was a journey of about five hundred miles from Hamilton Corners to
New York City and as Dick and his friends had planned it they would
be in the air all night

They had set for themselves a rate of progress of about fifty miles an
hour and if this was kept up it would take ten hours to the metropolis

Of course the journey could have been made in much less time than that
for Dicks motor was calculated to give a maximum speed of one hundred
miles an hour But this was straining it to its capacity It would be
much more feasible at least on this trial trip to use half that
speed Later if need be they could go to the limit

They had started late in the afternoon and by journeying at fifty
miles an hour they would reach the upper part of New York city in the
morning that is if nothing occurred to delay them But the weather
predictions were favorable and no storms were in prospect

I think Ill take her up a bit remarked Dick when they had passed
out over the open country lying outside of Hamilton Corners We might
as well get used to good heights for when we cross the Rocky Mountains
well have to ascend some

Thats right agreed the lieutenant Take her up Dick

The young millionaire pulled over the lever of the vertical rudder and
as the nose of the Abaris was inclined upward she shot aloft her big
propellers in the rear pushing her ahead

Im going out on the outer deck and see how it seems said Larry I
want to get some new impressions for the paper I told the editor wed
pull off a lot of new stunts So I guess Ill go outside

No you wont said Lieutenant McBride laying a detaining hand on
the arm of the reporter Do you see that notice

He pointed to one over the door It read


No one will be allowed on the outer deck while the airship is
ascending or descending


Whats that for Larry wanted to know

So you wont roll off into space replied Lieutenant McBride You
see the deck is much tilted when we are going up or down and that
makes it dangerous Of course the cabin floor is tilted also but
there are walls here to save you from taking a tumble in case you slip
Outside there is only a railing

I see spoke Larry Well Ill stay inside until we get up as high
as Dick wants to take us

Not very high this time the young millionaire answered About six
thousand feet will be enough We havent gone quite a mile yet and it
will be a good test for us

Steadily the aircraft climbed upward until when he had noted from the
barograph that they were at a height of nearly six thousand feet Dick
straightened her out and let her glide along on a level keel

You may now go outside Larry said the lieutenant and the young
reporter and the others except Dick who remained at the wheel took
their places in the open

It was a strange sensation standing out thus on a comparatively frail
craft shooting along at fifty miles an hour over a mile above the
earth The cabin broke the force of the wind and there was really
little discomfort The Abaris sailed so steadily that there was
scarcely a perceptible motion Larry made some notes for a story on
which he was engaged He wrote it in his best style and then enclosed
the copy in a leather case

Im going to drop this when we are passing over some city he
explained Someone is sure to pick it up and Ive put a note in
saying that if they will file the copy at some telegraph office so it
can be sent to my paper theyll get five dollars on presentation of my
note

Good idea cried Dick

Oh Ive got to get the news to the office somehow said Larry with
a smile

A little later they passed over a large town and though they did not
know the name of it Larry dropped his story and eventually as he
learned later it reached the office safely and made a hit

In order that all might become familiar with the workings of the
airship Dick after a while relinquished the wheel to one of his
chums Thus they took turns guiding the craft through the air and
gained valuable experience

They flew along easily and without incident until dusk began to
overcast the sky and then the electric lamps were set aglow and in
the cosy cabin they gathered about the table on which Innis had spread
a tempting lunch

Say this sure is going some cried Larry as he took another helping
of chicken prepared on the electric stove Think of dining a mile in
the air

As long as we dont fall down while were dining I shant mind
mumbled Paul as he picked a wishbone

The night passed without incident of moment For a time no one wanted
to go to the comfortable bunks but Dick insisted that they must get
used to sleeping aboard his craft so the watch was told off two of
the occupants of the Abaris to be on duty for two hours at a time to
be relieved by others

On and on rushed the airship Now and then she was speeded up for a
time as Dick and the aviator wanted to see what she could do when
called on suddenly She responded each time

I think shell do said Lieutenant McBride when it came his turn to
take a little rest You have a fine craft Mr Hamilton

Glad of it responded Dick Well see what she does when we
straighten her out on the long run to San Francisco

The night wore on Above the earth like some gigantic meteor flew
the airship her propellers forcing her onward and onward Now and
then some of the machinery needed attention but very little The
gyroscope stabilizer worked well and as it was automatic there was no
need of warping the wing tips or of using the alerons which were
provided in case of emergency The Abaris automatically kept herself
on a level keel even as a bird does when flying

The gray dawn crept in through the celluloid windows of the aircraft
This material had been used instead of glass to avoid accidents in
case of a crash The celluloid would merely bend and injure no one

Its morning cried Dick as he sprang from his bunk for he had had
the previous watch

Morning repeated Innis Well where are we

Have to go down and take an observation suggested the lieutenant I
think we must be very near New York

Paul who was in charge of the wheel looked for confirmation to Dick
The latter nodded and the cadet pulled the lever that would send the
airship on a downward slant

It was not long before a group of big buildings came into view It
needed but a glance to tell what they were skyscrapers

New York cried Dick Were over New York all right

Then Ive got to get a message to my paper exclaimed Larry Is the
wireless working

Well have to make a landing to send it up replied Mr Vardon

Well if were going down anyhow a telephone will do as well went
on the reporter Only its going to be a job to land down among all
those skyscrapers

We cant do it Mr Vardon declared

Well have to head for an open space

Central Park or the Bronx put in the lieutenant Either place
will give us room enough

Well try the Bronx suggested Dick That will give us a chance to
see New York from aloft Well land in the Bronx

They had sailed over to the metropolis from a point about opposite
Jersey City and now they took a direct Northward course flying
lengthwise over Manhattan

As they came on down and down they were observed by thousands of early
workers who craned their necks upward and looked with eager eyes at
the big airship over their heads

A few minutes of flying over the city brought the aviators within sight
of the big beautiful Zoological Park which is the pride of New York
Below Dick and his chums stretched out the green expanses the gardens
the little lakes and the animal enclosures

Theres a good place exclaimed Dick pointing to a green expanse
near the wildfowl pond

Then you take the wheel and make it suggested Innis who had been
steering

Dick did so but his hand accidentally touched the gasolene lever
cutting off the supply to the motor In an instant the machine went
dead

Never mind cried the young millionaire Ill go down anyhow No
use starting the motor again Ill volplane and land where I can

And as it happened he came down in New York in the midst of the
Bronx Park buffalo range

It was a perfect landing the Abaris reaching the ground with scarcely
a jar But the big shaggy buffaloes snorted in terror and ran in all
directions That is all but one big bull and he with a bellow of
rage charged straight for the airship



CHAPTER XXI

OFF FOR THE PACIFIC

Look out for him

Go up in the air again

Has anybody got a gun

Start the motor

These and other excited cries came from those in Dick Hamiltons
airship as they saw the charging buffalo The animal was the largest
in the captive herd probably the leader It seemed a strange thing
for a modern airship to be threatened with an attack by a buffalo in
these days but such was the case

He may damage us cried Dick Weve got to do something

But there seemed nothing to do Before they could get out of the cabin
of the airship which now rested on the ground within the buffalo
range the frightened and infuriated animal might rush at the craft

And though he would probably come off second best in the odd battle
he might damage some of the frail planes or rudders

Come on cried Paul Lets all rush out at him at once and yell as
hard as we can That may scare him off

But there was no need of this Before the buffalo had time to reach
the airship a mounted police officer rode rapidly up to the fence of
the enclosure and taking in the situation novel as it was at a
glance he fired several shots from his revolver at the rushing animal

None of the bullets was intended to hit the buffalo and none did But
some came so close and the noise of the shots was so loud that the
beast stopped suddenly and then after a pause in which he snorted
and pawed the ground he retreated to stand in front of the herd of
cows and other bulls probably thinking he constituted himself their
protector against the strange and terrible foe

Well thats over exclaimed Dick with a sigh of relief Say
isnt this the limit If we bad an airship out on the plains fifty
years ago it wouldnt have been any surprise to be charged by a
buffalo But here in New Yorkwell it is just about the extreme
edge to my way of thinking

Alls well that ends well quoted Innis Now lets get breakfast

But it seemed that something else was to come first

Get your craft out of there ordered the police officer who had
fired the shots

I guess wed better said Dick to his chums That buffalo might
change his mind and come at us again

How are we going to get out asked Mr Vardon as he noticed the
heavy fence around the buffalo enclosure And there was hardly room
inside it to get the necessary start to raise the big airship

Ill unlock this gate for you and you can wheel her out said the
officer who seemed to know something about aircraft He rode over to
a double gate which he soon swung open and Dick and his chums by
considerable exertion managed to wheel the airship out on the walk
The slope of the buffalo enclosure was downward or they might not have
been successful

Now then went on the mounted policeman when he had locked the gate
to prevent any of the animals from straying out whos in charge of
this outfit

I am admitted Dick as his chums looked at him

Well then Im sorry but I have to place you under arrest spoke the
officer Youll have to come with me

Arrest What for gasped Dick

Two charges Entering the buffalo enclosure without a permit and
flying an airship over a city I saw you come from down New York way

For a moment those of Dicks aviation party hardly knew whether to
treat the matter as a joke or not but a look at the face of the
officer soon convinced them that he at least was in earnest

Under arrest murmured Dick Well I guess the two charges are
true as far as that goes We did fly over the city but there was no
harm in that and

Hold onyes there was exclaimed Mr Vardon It was stupid of me
to forget it too It is against the law now for an aeroplane to fly
over a city and contrary to the agreement of the association of
aviators

You are right exclaimed Lieutenant McBride I should have thought
of that too but I was so interested watching the working of the
machinery I forgot all about it The rule and the law was made because
of the danger to persons over whose heads the aeroplanes might
flythat is not so much danger in the flying as in the corning down
And then too as a general thing it might not be safe for the aviators
if they were forced to make a landing But weve gone and done it I
guess and he smiled frankly at the officer

As for coming down in the buffalo enclosure I was sorry we did it
when I saw that old bull coming for us remarked Dick But it seemed
the best place around here for us to land after our motor stopped I
suppose it wont do any good to say were sorry will it he asked the
policeman with a smile

Well I shall have to do my duty and arrest you said the officer
but I will explain to the magistrate that you did not mean to land
contrary to the law

Who is the magistrate before whom we shall have to appear asked
Larry Dexter

Judge Scatterwaite was the answer

Good cried the young reporter I know him My paper supported him
in the last campaign and I believe he will be glad to do a favor for
me Is there a telephone around here he asked the officer Oh we
wont run away he hastened to assure the guardian of the peace I
just want to talk to the judge Im Larry Dexter of the Leader

Oh is that so I guess Ive heard of you Arent you the reporter
who worked up that stolen boy case

I am admitted Larry modestly Theres a telephone right over
there in the Rocking Stone restaurant went on the officer who
seemed to regard Larry and his friends in a different light now You
can call up the judge Hell probably be at his house now Ill go
with you It may be that he will want to speak to me and will dismiss
the complaint

Well wait here for you Larry said Dick Theres nothing like
having a reporter with you when you break the law he added with a
laugh

The officer rode his horse slowly along with Larry going to the place
whence a telephone message could be sent Larry was soon talking with
the judge who on learning the identity of the young reporter and
having heard the circumstances spoke to the officer

Its all right exclaimed the policeman as he hung up the receiver
Im to let you go He says hell find you all guilty and will
suspend sentence

Good cried Larry Thats the time my pull was of some use

And Im glad I didnt have to take you to the station the mounted
man proceeded Im interested in airships myself Ive got a boy
whos crazy about them and wireless Hes got a wireless outfitmade
it all himself he added proudly

There was nothing further to worry the aviators on the return of Larry
with the officer so they prepared to have breakfast and then
Lieutenant McBride said he would arrange to have the official start in
the prize race made from Fort Wadsworth

But well have to fly over New York again suggested Dick and if
were arrested a second time

I think I can arrange that for you said the army man I will have
the war department make a request of the civil authorities who will no
doubt grant permission to soar over the city

Good cried Dick And now for breakfast Didnt that officer say
something about a restaurant around here

Yes I telephoned from one spoke Larry Then lets go there and
have breakfast suggested the young millionaire Well have a little
more room than in the airship and Innis wont have to do the cooking

Oh I dont mind the stout cadet put in

What about leaving the airship all alone asked Paul for already a
crowd had gathered about it

Ill look out for it while youre gone promised the officer

Isnt there some shed around here where we could leave it so it would
be safe asked Innis

Whats the idea of that Dick wanted to know Well be sailing down
to the fort in an hour or so

Why cant we stay over a day or so in New York went on Innis I
dont get here very often and Id like to see the sights

You mean youd like to see the girls declared Paul laughingly

Have your own way murmured Innis But if the airship would be
safe up here in the park in a shed we could take our time and not
have to hurry so

I guess that would be a good plan agreed Dick Id like to see the
girls myself Well do it if we can find a shed

The obliging officer arranged this for them and the airship was soon
safely housed a watchman being engaged to keep away the curious Then
our friends went to breakfast and later down town

Mr Vardon wanted to call on some fellow aviators now that it had been
decided to postpone the start a day and Larry Dexter had some business
to transact at the newspaper office

And well go see the girls cried Dick

Mabel Hanford Grace Knox and Irene Martin the three young ladies in
whom the boys were more than ordinarily interested had come on to New
York after their school closed and our friends had made a
halfpromise to meet them in the metropolis Now the promise could be
kept They found the girls at a hotel where they resided part of the
year and sending up their cards were ushered to their sittingroom

And did you really come all the way from Hamilton Corners to New York
in your airship asked Mabel of Dick

We surely did he answered And were going to start for San
Francisco tomorrow We just stopped overnight to see you

We appreciate the honor laughed Irene with a bow

Have you any engagement for tonight asked Innis

We were going to the theatre said Grace

Isnt there any place we could go to a dance inquired Paul

Say hes crazy on these new dances exclaimed Dick I caught him
doing the lame duck the other night with the broom for a partner

Oh do you do that cried Mabel

A little admitted Paul

Will you show us how the steps go asked Irene

And I know the lace glide and the pivot whirl put in Dick You
neednt think you can walk off with all the honors he said to his
chum laughingly

Oh lets stay at the hotel and dance tonight suggested Mabel
Mamma will chaperone us It will be more fun than the theatre

Well have to hire dress suits said Innis We didnt bring them in
the airship

No well make it very informal Grace remarked There is a little
private ballroom we can engage

So it was arranged and the young people spent an enjoyable evening
doing some of the newest steps

Well come down to the fort in the morning and see you start for San
Francisco promised Mabel as she said goodnight to Dick

Will you he exclaimed That will be fine of you

An early morning start was made for the fort after the airship which
had been left in Bronx Park all night had been carefully gone over
An additional supply of gasolene was taken aboard some adjustments
made to the machinery and more food put in the lockers

There are the girls exclaimed Dick after they had made a successful
landing at the fort which they would soon leave on their long flight

Oh so they are I hardly thought theyd come down observed Paul
as he waved to the three pretty girls with whom they had danced the
night before

I wish we were going with you cried Mabel as she greeted Dick

Oh Mabel You do not rebuked Irene

Well I just do was the retort Its so stupid just staying at a
summer resort during the hot weather

Well come back after we win the prize and do the aeroplane glide
with you promised Innis

Will you demanded Irene Remember now thats a promise

Final arrangements were made and everything was in readiness for the
start for the Pacific The army officers had inspected the craft and
congratulated the young owner and the builder on her completeness

Well goodbye girls said Dick as he and his chums shook hands
with their friends who had come to see them off The aviators took
their places in the cabin A hasty inspection showed that everything
was in readiness

Well here we go murmured Dick

He turned the switch of the electric starter and an instant later
the Abaris shot forward over the ground rising gracefully on a long
upward slant

Then Dick who was at the steering wheel headed his craft due West

From the parade ground below them came cheers from the army men and
other spectators the shrill cries of the three girls mingling

I wonder what will happen before we dance with them again spoke
Paul musingly

You cant tell answered Innis as he looked down for a last sight of
a certain pretty face

Well we can only hit the ground twice between here and San
Francisco remarked Dick as he turned on more power If we have to
come down the third timewe lose the prize

Were not going to lose it asserted Mr Vardon earnestly

Of course there were many more entrants for the prize than Dick
Hamilton Two airships had started that morning before he got off in
his craft and three others were to leave that afternoon One
prominent birdman from the West was due to start the next day and on
the following two from the South were scheduled to leave There were
also several wellknown foreigners who were making a try for the fame
honor and money involved

But this story only concerns Dick Hamiltons airship and the attempt
of himself and his Uncle Ezra to win the prize and I have space for
no more than a mere mention of the other contestants



CHAPTER XXII

UNCLE EZRA STARTS OFF

Let us now for a moment return to Uncle Ezra We left him sitting on
the ground after his rather unceremonious exit from the airship which
had crashed into the apple tree in the orchard Somehow the strap
holding him to his seat had come unbuckled which accounted for his
plight

Are you hurt asked Lieutenant Larson after a quick glance that
assured him the airship was not badly damaged

I dont knows Im hurt such a terrible lot was the slow answer
but my clothes are all dirt This suit is plumb ruined now I swan
Id never have gone in for airships if I knew how expensive theyd be
This suit cost thirteen dollars and

Youre lucky you dont have to pay for a funeral was the
lieutenants grim answer You must look to your seat strap better
than that

Well I didnt know the blamed thing was going to cut up like this
returned the crabbed old man Thats no way to land

I know it But I couldnt help it was the answer Im glad youre
not hurt But I think we have attracted some attention Here comes
someone

A man was running through the orchard

Its Hank Crittenden and he hates me like poison murmured Uncle
Ezra as he arose from the pile of dirt and tried to get some of it
off his clothes

Hi there Whats this mean demanded Hank as he rushed up
clutching a stout club What dye mean comin down in my orchard
and bustin up my best Baldwin tree What dye mean

It was an accidentpurely an accident said Lieutenant Larson
suavely It could not be helped

Accident You done it on puppose thats what you did cried Hank
glaring at Uncle Ezra You done it on puppose and Ill sue ye for
damages thats what Ill do That Baldwin apple tree was one of the
best in my orchard

Well we didnt mean to do it declared Mr Larabee And if you sue
we can prove in court it was an accident So youll have your trouble
for your pains

I will hey Well Ill show you Ezra Larabee Ill teach you to
come around here bustin my things up with your old airship You ought
to be ashamed of yourself a man of your age trying to fly like a hen
or rooster

Im trying for the government prize said Dicks uncle weakly

Huh A heap sight chance YOU have of winnin a prize flyin like
that sneered Mr Crittenden Comin down in my orchard that way

It was an accident went on the former army man We were making a
landing but we did not intend to come clown just in that spot We are
sorry the tree is broken but accidents will happen and

Yes and them as does em must pay for em exclaimed Hank

At the mention of money Uncle Ezra looked pained He looked more so
when Hank went on

Ill have damages for that tree thats what Ill have and good
damages too That was my best Baldwin tree

You told us that before said Larson as he began to wheel the
aeroplane out into an open space where he could get it started again

Here where you takin that demanded Hank suspiciously

Were going to fly back to Dankville replied Mr Larson

No you aint You aint goin t move that machine until you pay fer
the damage to my tree insisted Hank as he took a firmer grasp of the
club I want ten dollars for what you done to my tree

Ten dollars grasped Uncle Ezra Taint wuth half that if it was
loaded with apples

Well youll pay me ten dollars Ezra Larabee or you dont take that
machine away from here insisted the owner of the orchard You beat
me once in a lawsuit but you wont again

The two had been enemies for many years Mr Crittenden insisting that
a certain lawsuit which went against him had been wrongfully decided
in favor of Dicks uncle

Well I wont pay no ten dollars said Mr Larabee firmly putting
his hand in his pocket as if to resist any attempt to get money from
it

Ten dollars or you dont take that machine out cried Hank Youre
trespassers on my land too I could have you arrested for that as
well as suin ye fer bustin my tree

Ill never pay said Uncle Ezra Come on Lieutenant well take
the airship out in spite of him

Oh you will eh cried Hank Well well see about that I
reckoned youd try some such mean game as that Ezra Larabee and Im
ready for you Here Si and Bill he called and from behind a big
tree stepped two stalwart hired men armed with pitchforks

This Ezra Larabee allows hell not pay for damagin my tree
explained Hank I say he shall and I dont want you boys t let him
take his contraption away until he forks over ten dollars

It aint worth nigh that sum began Mr Larabee Ill never

I think perhaps you had better pay it to avoid trouble said the
lieutenant He has some claim on us

Oh dear groaned Uncle Ezra More money This airship business
will ruin me Ten dollars

Not a cent less declared Hank

Wont you call it eight asked the crabbed old miser

Ten dollars if you want to take away your machine and then you can
consider yourselves lucky that I dont sue you for trespass Hand over
ten dollars

Never declared Ezra Larabee

I really think you had better advised the aviator and then with a
wry face and much reluctance Dicks uncle passed over the money

Now you kin go cried Hank but if I ketch you on my property agin
you wont git off so easy You can go back boys I wont need you
this time he added grimly

The hired men departed and Mr Crittenden pocketing the money
watched the lieutenant and Uncle Ezra wheel the biplane out to an open
place where a start could be made

The machine was somewhat damaged but it could still be operated The
motor however was obstinate and would not start Hank added insult
to injury at least in the opinion of Uncle Ezra by laughing at the
efforts of the lieutenant And finally when the motor did consent to
mote it went so slowly that not enough momentum could be obtained to
make the airship rise It simply rolled slowly over the ground

Ha Ha Thats a fine flyin machine youve got there cried Hank
laughing heartily Youd better walk if youre goin t git any
govment prize

Oh dry up spluttered Uncle Ezra who was now real mad as he
admitted later He and the lieutenant wheeled the machine back to have
another try and this time they were successful in getting up in the
air The aviator circled about and headed for Dankville the airship
having come down about three miles from Uncle Ezras place

Well youre flyin thats a fact cried Mr Crittenden as he looked
aloft at them But I wouldnt be surprised t see em come smashin
down agin any minute he added pessimistically Anyhow I got ten
dollars out of Ezra Larabee he concluded with a chuckle

Mr Larabee looked glum when he and the lieutenant got back to the
airship shed

This is costing me a terrible pile of money said the crabbed old
man A terrible pile And I reckon youll have to spend more for
fixing her up wont you he asked in a tone that seemed to indicate
he hoped for a negative answer

Oh yes well have to fix her up said the lieutenant and buy a
new carburetor too You know you promised that

Yes I suppose so sighed Uncle Ezra More money And that skunk
Hank Crittenden got ten dollars out of me Ill never hear the last of
that Id rather have landed anywhere but on his land Oh this is
awful I wish Id never gone into it

But think of the twenty thousand dollars said the former army man
quickly It would not do to have his employer get too much
discouraged And the aviator wanted more moneyvery much more

The airship was repaired in the next few days though there was a
constant finding of fault on the part of Uncle Ezra He parted with
cash most reluctantly

However he had officially made his entry for the government prize and
he could not withdraw now He must keep on Lieutenant Larson
arranged with one of the army aviators to accompany them on the
prospective trip from coast to coast and finally Larson announced that
he was ready to start for New York where the flight would officially
begin

Well Ezra said his wife as he climbed into the machine on the day
appointed I dont like to be a discourager and throw cold water on
you but I dont reckon Ill ever see you again Ezra and she wiped
her eyes

Oh pshaw Of course youll see me again her husband cried Im
going to come back with that twenty thousand dollars And IIll buy
a new carriagethats what I will

Thats awful good of you Ezra she said But Im not countin on
it Im afraid youll never come back she sighed

Oh yes I will he declared Goodbye

They were to pick up the army officer in New York and so Larson and
Uncle Ezra made the first part of the journey alone They had
considerable trouble on the way having to come down a number of times

Say if shes going to work this way what will happen when we start
for San Francisco asked Mr Larabee

Oh it will be all right when I make a few changes in her the
lieutenant said And when we have another man aboard shell ride
easier

Well I hope so murmured Uncle Ezra But more changes Will
theyercost money

A little

Uncle Ezra groaned

However New York was eventually reached and after some repairs and
changes were made the airship was taken to the same place where Dicks
had started from and with the army representative aboard the journey
for the Pacific coast was begun The beginning of the flight was
auspicious enough but if Uncle Ezra could have known all that was
before him I am doubtful if he would have gone on



CHAPTER XXIII

AN IMPROMPTU RACE

Hows she running

Couldnt be better

Youre not crowding her though are you I mean we can go faster
cant we

Oh yes but I think if we average fifty miles an hour for the whole
trip well be doing well

Dick Paul and Innis were talking together in the small pilothouse of
the airship And it was Dick who made the remark about the speed
They had risen high above New York now and were headed across the
Hudson to the Jersey shore They would cover the Western part of the
Garden State

It sure is great cried Innis as he looked down from the height If
anyone had told me a year ago that Id be doing this Id never have
believed him

Me either declared Dick But its the best sport I ever heard
about

And you sure have got some airship declared Larry admiringly The
young reporter had just finished writing an account of the start
heading his article Aboard the Abaris and enclosed in a leather
holder had dropped the story from a point near the clouds The
leather cylinder had a small flag attached to it and as it was dropped
down while the airship was shooting across the city it attracted
considerable attention By means of a glass Larry saw his story picked
up and he felt sure it would reach the paper safely And he learned
later such was the case

Wed better arrange to divide up the work of running things while
were in the airship suggested Dick We want to have some sort of
system

Thats right agreed Mr Vardon We shall have to do some sleeping

How long do you figure you will take for the trip asked Lieutenant
McBride who was making official notes of the manner in which the motor
behaved and of the airship in general

Well answered Dick we can make a hundred miles an hour when were
put to it and he looked at Mr Vardon for confirmation

Yes that can be done the aviator said But of course we could not
keep that up as the motor would hardly stand it But fifty miles on
the average for the entire trip would be a fair estimate I think

And figuring on it being three thousand miles from New York to San
Francisco we could do it in sixty hours of continuous flight added
Dick Only of course well not have such luck as that

No weve got to make one descent anyhow about halfway across to
take on more oil and gasolene Mr Vardon said And we will be very
lucky if we dont have to come down but once more on the way But we
may have luck

I think we will cried Dick

While the young millionaire was at the wheel taking the airship higher
and higher and Westward on her journey Mr Vardon and Lieutenant
McBride arranged a schedule of work so that each one would have an
opportunity of steering

And while youre at it suggested Innis I wish youd arrange a
schedule for the cooking Have I got to do it all

Indeed not said Dick Well put Paul and Larry to work in the
galley

Not me exclaimed Paul I cant even cook water without burning it

Get out Dont you always do your share of the camp cooking when we
go off on hikes and practice marches objected Innis to his cadet
chum Indeed and youll do your share of it here all right Ill see
to that

I guess Im caught admitted Paul

The start had been made about ten oclock in the morning and before
noon more than ninety miles had been covered as registered on the
distance gage This took the party across New Jersey

They had passed over Newark and the Orange mountains The rule
against flying over a city had bothered Dick who argued that it would
take him much out of his air line and consume more time if he always
had to pick out an unpopulated section

So the rule was abrogated as far as the aviation association was
concerned

And if the policemen of any cities we fly over want to take a chance
and chase us in an aerial motor cycle let em come laughed the young
millionaire

Dinner was served at a height of about eight thousand feet Dick
wanted to get himself and his companions accustomed to great heights
as they would have to fly high over the Rockies There was some little
discomfort at first in the rarefied atmosphere but they soon got
used to it and liked it Grit however suffered considerably and
did not seem to care for aeroplaning But he was made so much of and
everyone was so fond of him that he seemed after a while to forget
his troubles He wanted to be near Dick all the time

Mr Vardon was a veteran aviator and heights did not bother him
Lieutenant McBride too had had considerable experience

Afternoon found the Abaris over Pennsylvania which state would require
about six hours to cross at the speed of fifty miles every sixty
minutes The captive balloons and other landmarks enabled them to
keep to their course

Dick put his craft through several stunts to further test its
reliability and flexibility To every one she answered perfectly The
gyroscope stabilizer was particularly effective and no matter how
severe a strain was put on the craft she either came to an even keel
at once when deflected from it or else did not deviate from it

I shall certainly report as to the wisdom of having such an apparatus
on every airship the United States uses declared Lieutenant McBride
No matter whether Dick Hamiltons craft wins the prize or notand I
certainly hope he doesthe gyroscope must be used

I am glad to hear you say so spoke the inventor but I never would
have been able to perfect it had it not been for my friend Dick
Hamilton

Why dont you blush Dick asked Innis playfully

I dont take any credit to myself at all said the young millionaire

Well Im going to give it to you declared the aviator From now
on the gyroscope stabilizer will be known as the VardonHamilton and
some additional patents I contemplate taking out will be in our joint
names

Thanks said Dick but Ill accept only on one condition

What is that

It is that no money from this invention comes to me If I win the
twenty thousand dollar prize Ill be content

What are you going to do with the money asked Paul Drew for Dick
really had no need of it

Ill build a new gym at Kentfield was the reply Our present one
is too small We need an indoor baseball cage too

Good for you cried Innis Youre a real sport

In the evolutions of the airship each one aboard was given a chance to
pilot her He was also allowed to stop and start the machinery since
it could not be told at what moment in an emergency someone would
have to jump into the breech

It was about three oclock in the afternoon when Dicks ship was
nearing the Western borders of Pennsylvania that Paul who was looking
down through the celluloid floor in the cabin cried out

Something going on down below us boys

All save Innis who was steering crowded around the odd window

Why theres an airship meet going on down there said Dick Look
there are a lot of monoplanes and some biplanes

Lets go down a bit and salute them suggested Larry

Down she is cried Innis as he pulled over the lever of the
deflecting rudder Say when Dick

Oh keep her up about two thousand feet We dont want to interfere
with any of their evolutions

But the advent of the Abaris seemed welcomed by the other airships that
were taking part in the evolutions below Two of them which had been
flying high at once pointed their noses upward and raced forward to
get in line with Dicks craft

Theyre going to race us Paul shouted

Come on Dick nows your chance

Shall I the young millionaire asked of Mr Vardon

Yes go ahead Lets see what we can do to them Though they are
probably much swifter than we are

Take the wheel Dick cried Innis I want to see you beat em

The implied challenge was at once accepted and in another moment the
impromptu race was under way



CHAPTER XXIV

GRITS GRIP

Two large biplanes were in the race with Dick Hamiltons airship They
were of the latest type as could be noted by the young millionaire
and were swift craft They had come up from behind on a long upward
slant and were now about in line with each other and on a par with
the Abaris though considerably below her

Say look at that crowd of people exclaimed Paul as he stood at the
side of Dick who was at the wheel The cadet was ready to lend any
assistance that might be needed in working the airship

Yes there is quite a bunch observed Dick as he opened the gasolene
throttle a little wider and took a quick glance down through the
celluloid bullseye in the floor of the cabin Its a big meet

They were flying over a big aviation park that Mr Vardon at once
recognized as one in which he had given several exhibitions

This is quite a meet all right the aviator remarked as he noted at
least ten machines in the air at one time There were mono and
biplanes but only two of the latter were near enough to Dicks machine
to engage in the impromptu race with it

How are we coming on asked Paul

Holding our own answered the young millionaire I havent started
to speed yet Im waiting to see what those fellows are going to do

The latter however were evidently also hanging back trying to get a
line on the performance of the big craft The pilots of the lower
biplanes could very likely tell by the size of the Abaris that she
was no ordinary airship and in all probability they had read of her
and of the try for the prize For Larry Dexter made a good press
agent and had written many a story of Dicks plans

Now theyre coming on cried Dick as he saw one of the lower
machines dart ahead of the other Hes trying to get me to sprint I
guess

Why dont you try it now suggested Mr Vardon Well soon be at
the limits of the aviation field and I doubt if these machines will be
allowed to go beyond it So if you want to beat them in a race now is
your time to speed up

Here she goes cried Dick as he opened wider the gasolene throttle

In an instant the big craft shot ahead fairly roaring through the air
The closed cabin however kept the pressure of wind from the
occupants or they might not have been able to stand it for the gage
outside registered a resistance of many pounds to the square inch

It was an odd race There were no cheering spectators to urge on the
contestants by shouts and cheers though doubtless those who were
witnessing the evolutions of the aircraft before Dicks advent on the
scene were using their voices to good advantage But the birdmen were
too high up to hear them

Nor could the excited calls if there were any such from the two
rivals of our hero be heard There were two men in each of the
competing biplanes and they were doing their best to win

It must have been an inspiring sight from below for Dicks craft was
so large that it showed up well and the white canvas planes of the
others as well as those of the Abaris stood out in bold contrast to
the blue of the sky

Were doing ninety an hour called Dick after a glance at the speed
gage while his companions were looking down at the craft below

Pretty nearly the limit remarked Mr Vardon If you can reach a
hundred Dick do it I dont believe those fellows can come near
that

Theyre falling behind now observed Paul Go to it Dick old man

The young millionaire pulled open the gasolene throttle to the full
limit and set the sparker to contact at the best advantage The result
was at once apparent The aircraft shot ahead in a wonderful fashion
The others evidently put on full speed for they also made a little
spurt

Then it was all over but the shouting as Larry said Dicks machine
swept on and soon distanced the others

Ive got to get back a story of this cried Larry It will be good
reading for those who buy the Leader

But how are you going to do it asked Paul You cant send back a
story now and wed have to make a descent to use the wireless Dicks
craft being so fitted up

Ill just write a little note telling the editor to get the story
from the Associated Press correspondent who is covering this meet
Larry answered All they need in the Leader office is a tip
Theyll do the rest But Ill just give them a few pointers as to how
things went on here

He hastily dashed off a story and enclosed it in one of several leather
cylinders he had provided for this purpose Each one had a sort of
miniature parachute connected to it and a flag to attract attention as
it shot down

Enclosing his story in one of these Larry dropped it as he had done
before trusting that it would be picked up and forwarded The plan
always worked well

The leather messenger fell on the aviation field and our friends had
the satisfaction of seeing several men running to pick it up so Larry
knew his plan would be successful

The Abaris was now speeding along at the top notch and for a few
minutes Dick allowed her to soar through the air in this fashion And
then having some regard for his engines he cut down the gasolene and
slowed up

No use tearing her heart out he remarked

Theres time enough to rush on the last lap I wonder if well have a
race at the end

I shouldnt be surprised Mr Vardon answered A number of
celebrated aviators are planning to compete for this prize and some
may already be on the way across the continent ahead of us

Then theres your Uncle Ezra put in Paul

Poor Uncle Ezra spoke Dick musingly He certainly has treated me
mean at times but I cant help feeling sorry for him Every time he
has to buy five gallons of gasolene or some oil hell imagine hes
getting ready to go to the poorhouse He certainly was not cut out for
an aviator and I certainly was surprised when he built that airship

Hes being used by that fellow Larson Im sure of that declared Mr
Vardon Your Uncle Ezra has fallen into the hands of a scoundrel
Dick

Well Im sorry for that of course said the young millionaire
but do you know I think it will do Uncle Ezra good to lose some of
his money Hes got more than he needs and he can afford to spend
some on aviation Someone at least the workmen and those who sell
materials and supplies will get the benefit of it

The aircraft was now going along at about her usual speed of fifty
miles an hour The aviation park had been left behind and they were
now flying along at a comparatively low altitude

Better go up a little suggested Mr Vardon It will be dark
shortly and we dont want to run into a mountain in the night

Dick tilted the elevating rudder and the craft lifted herself into the
air soaring upward

Here Innis you take the wheel now its your turn called our hero
a little later Straighten her out and keep her on a level keel
Its my turn to get supper

And give us plenty if you dont mind begged the stout cadet who
took his chums place in the pilot house This upper atmosphere seems
to give me an appetite

I never saw you without it Innis laughed Paul

Come on out on the deck for a breath of air before we start to cook
suggested Larry We can get a fine view of the sunset there

The open deck in the rear of the cabin did indeed offer a gorgeous
view of the setting sun which was sinking to rest in a bank of golden
green and purple clouds

Ill go out too said Lieutenant McBride I am supposed to make
some meteorological observations while I am on this trip and it is
high time I began

And so with the exception of Innis who would have his turn later and
Mr Vardon who wanted to look over the machinery for possible heated
bearings all went out on the railed deck Grit the bulldog followed
closely on the heels of Dick

Be careful old man said the young millionaire to his pet Theres
no rail close to the deck you know and you may slip overboard

They stood for a few moments viewing the scene while thus flying along
through the air The colors of the sunset were constantly changing
becoming every moment more gorgeous

Suddenly there was a swerve to the airship and it tilted sharply to
one side

Look out cried Dick as he grasped the protecting railing an
example followed by all Whats up

Were falling shouted Paul

No its just an air pocket was the opinion of Lieutenant McBride
Well be all right in another moment

They were but before that Grit taken unawares had slid unwillingly
to the edge of the open deck

Look out for him shouted Dick making a grab for his pet

But he was too late The deck was smooth and the bulldog could get no
grip on it In another instant he had toppled over the edge of the
platform rolling under the lowest of the guard rails

There he goes cried Paul

Dick gave a gasp of despair Grit let out a howl of fear

And then as Larry Dexter leaned over the side he gave a cry of
surprise

Look he shouted Grits caught by a rope and hes hanging there by
his teeth

And as Dick looked he saw a strange sight Trailing over the side of
the airship deck was a piece of rope that had become loosed And in
his fall Grit had caught hold of this in his strong jaws To this he
clung like grim death his grip alone keeping him from falling into
space



CHAPTER XXV

A FORCED LANDING

Hold on there old boy Dont let go begged Dick of his pet who
swung to and fro dangling like some grotesque pendulum over the side
of the airship Hold on Grit

And Grit held on you may be sure of that His jaws were made for just
that purpose The dog made queer gurgling noises in his throat for he
dare not open his mouth to bark Probably he knew just what sort of
death would await him if he dropped into the vast space below him

How we going to get him up asked Larry

Ill show you cried Dick as he stretched out at full length on the
deck and made his way to the edge where his head and shoulders
projected over the dizzying space The airship was still rushing on

Grab his legssomebody exclaimed Paul Ill sit on you Dick

Thats right Anchor me down old man Dick cried Im going to
get Grit

Are you going to make a landing to save him asked Larry

No though I would if I had to Dick replied Im just going to
haul him up by the rope Keep a good hold old boy he encouraged his
pet and Grit gurgled his answer

And then Dick leaning over the edge of the deck while Paul sat on his
backwardstretched legs to hold him in place hauled up the bulldog
hand over hand by means of the rope the intelligent animal had so
fortunately grasped

Inch by inch Grit was raised until Larry who had come to the edge to
help Dick reached out and helped to haul the dog in

There he is cried Dick as he slid back

Well old boy you had a close call

Grit let go the rope and barked And then a strange fit of trembling
seized him It was the first time he had ever showed fear He never
ventured near the edge of the deck again always taking a position as
near the centre as possible and lying down at full length to prevent
any danger of sliding off And he never went out on the deck unless
Dick went also feeling I suppose that he wanted his master near in
case of accidents

Say that was some little excitement remarked the young millionaire
as he wiped the beads of perspiration from his forehead I thought
poor old Grit was sure a goner

It did look so admitted Paul Hes an intelligent beast all
right

Takes after me laughed Dick Well lets see how Innis made out
while we were at the rescue

I was all ready to send her down quick if youd given the word said
the cadet in the pilot house when the party went inside the cabin

But shes still on her course he added after a glance at the
compass

Im glad we didnt have to go down Dick remarked As we only have
two landings we can make I want to save my reserve until we are
actually forced to use it I wonder about where we are anyhow Lets
make a calculation

By figuring out the rate of speed and comparing the elapsed time and
then by figuring on a scale map it was estimated as dusk settled
down that they were about on the border line between Pennsylvania and
Ohio

Well cross the state of Ohio tonight spoke Dick and by morning we
ought to be in Indiana Not so bad considering that we havent really
pushed the machine to the limit yet except in that little brush with
the other airships

Yes we are doing very well said Mr Vardon I wonder how some of
our competitors are making out Id like to get some news of them

So would I went on Dick Particularly my Uncle Ezra

Had he but known it Mr Larabee in his airship with Larson and the
army man was following close after him For really the big biplane
with the mercury stabilizers which Larson had constructed was a fine
craft and capable That Larson had cheated Mr Larabee out of
considerable money in the building had nothing to do with the working
of the apparatus But of Uncle Ezra and his aircraft more later

Well get some news the first landing we make suggested Lieutenant
McBride

Well I would like to get news all right admitted Dick But I
dont want to go down until I have to Now for supper Anything you
fellows would like especially

Green turtle soup for mine sung out Larry

Ill have pickled eels feet laughed Innis who had relinquished the
wheel to Mr Vardon Wait a bit Dick and Ill drop a line overboard
and catch a few

And Ill see if I cant shoot a mock turtle came from Paul

Nothing but roast turkey for mine insisted Lieutenant McBride But
I guess well have to compromise on capsule soup and condensed
sandwiches

Oh I can give you canned chicken promised the young millionaire
and perhaps I can make it hot for you

Not too much tabasco sauce though the way you dosed up the stuff for
the last Freshman dinner objected Paul I ate some of that by
mistake and I drank nothing but iced water for a week after

Thats rightit was a hot old time cried Dick with a laugh at the
recollection

As space was rather limited on board the airship no ice could be
carried and in consequence no fresh meats were available except for
the first few hours of travel Of course when a landing was to be
made another limited supply could be laid in but with only two
descents to earth allowed this would not help much

However as the trip was going to be a comparatively short one no one
minded the deprivation from the usual bountiful meals that somehow
one seemed to associate with the young millionaire

A good supply of capsule food was carried In making up his larder
Dick had consulted Lieutenant McBride who had given him a list of the
highly nutritious and condensed food used in the army

While such food was not the most appetizing in the world it could be
carried in a small space was easily prepared and would sustain life
and provide working energy fully as long as the more elaborate dishes
which contain a large amount of waste materials

Soon the electric stove was aglow and on it Dick got up a tasty
supper Innis insisted on helping his chum though it was Dicks turn
to play cook

You just cant keep out of the kitchen can you asked Dick of the
stout cadet You always want to be around where eating is going on

Well the only way to be sure of a thing is to do it yourself said
Innis I would hate to have this fine appetite of mine go to waste

It was quite dark when they sat at supper for some slight defect
manifested itself in one of the small motors just as they were about to
eat and it had to be repaired at once

But gathered about the folding table with the electric lights aglow
overhead there was little indication among the party of aviators that
they were in one of the most modern of skycraft sailing a mile above
the earth and shooting along at fifty miles an hour So easy was the
motion of the Abaris and so evenly and smoothly did she glide along
due to the automatic action of the gyroscope stabilizer that it really
seemed as if they were standing stillfloating between heaven and
earth

Of course there was the subdued hum of the great propellers outside
and the throb of the powerful gasolene motor but that was all that
gave an idea of the immense force contained in the airship

From time to time Lieutenant McBride made notes for future use He had
to report officially to the war department just how this type of
airship behaved under any and all circumstances Then too he was
interested personally for he had taken up aviation with great
enthusiasm and as there were not many army men in it so far he stood
a good chance for advancement

The possibilities of aeroplanes in time of war are only beginning to
be understood he said Of course there has been a lot of foolish
talk about them and probably they will not be capable of doing all
that has been claimed for them as yet But they will be of immense
value for scouting purposes if for nothing else In rugged and
mountainous countries an aviator will be under no difficulties at all
and can by hovering over the enemys camp get an idea of the
defenses and report back

Thus it will be possible to map out a plan of attack with every chance
of success There will be no time lost and lives may be saved from
useless exposure

Do you think airships will ever carry light artillery or drop bombs
on an enemy asked Dick

Well you could carry small artillery aboard here if you didnt have
so much company answered the army man It is all a question of
weight and size However I believe for the present the most
valuable aid airships will render will be in the way of scouting But I
dont want to see a war just for the sake of using our airships
Though it is well to be prepared to take advantage of their peculiar
usefulness

After supper they prepared to spend their first night aboard the
airship on her prizewinning attempt They decided to cut down the
speed a little

Not that theres much danger of hitting anything Dick explained
though possibly Uncle Ezra and Larson might come up behind and crash
into us But at slower speed the machinery is not so strained and
there is less likelihood of an accident

Thats right agreed Mr Vardon And an accident at night
especially when most of us are asleep is not so easily handled as when
it occurs in daylight So slow her down Dick

The motor was set to take them along at thirty miles an hour and they
descended until they were fifteen hundred feet above the earth so in
case of the Abaris becoming crippled she would not have to spend much
time in making a landing

Everything was well looked to and then with Dick and Mr Vardon
taking the first watch the others turned in And they were so tired
from the rather nervous excitement of the day of the start that they
were soon asleep Dick and the aviator took turns at the wheel and
attended to the necessary adjustments of the various machines

It might seem strange for anyone to sleep aboard a moving airship but
the truth of the matter was that our friends were realty worn out with
nervous exhaustion They had tired themselves out not only
physically but mentally and sleep was really forced on them
Otherwise they might not have slumbered at all

It was shortly past midnight when Dick who in spite of his attempts
to keep awake had partly dozed off was suddenly aroused by a howl
from Grit

Whatwhats the matter old boy he asked In trouble again

There came another and louder howl Where is he asked Mr Vardon
looking in from the pilothouse

I cant see him Dick answered Can he be out on deck

A moment later there was a flash as of lightning within the cabin and
Grit mingled his howls and barks as though in great pain

Somethings wrong cried the aviator Look about Dick I cant
leave the wheel We seem to be going down

The young millionaire sprang up and leaped toward the place where he
had heard Grit howling The next moment Dick laughed in a relieved
fashion

Where are those rubber gloves he asked

Rubber gloves repeated Mr Vardon

Yes Grit has gotten tangled up in the little dynamo that runs the
headlight and hes shortcircuited He can stand more of a shock than
I can I want to get him off the contacts Where are the gloves

The aviator directed Dick to where the insulating gauntlets were kept
and in another moment Grit was pulled away from the contact He had
been unable to move himself just as when one grasps the handles of a
galvanic battery the muscles become so bound as to be incapable of
motion

Fortunately the current while it made Grit practically helpless for
the time was not strong enough to burn or otherwise injure him He
gave a howl of protest at the accident as Dick released him and
shuffled off to his kennel after fawning on his master

One of the wires has some of the insulation offthats what caused
the trouble Dick explained Ill wind some tape on it until we have
time to put in a new conductor

Grit seems to be getting the worst end of it this trip said Paul
who had been awakened by the commotion

Yes he isnt much used to airships agreed Dick But youd better
turn in Paul Youve got an hour yet before its your turn at the
wheel

Oh better let me have it now Im awake and I cant get to sleep
again Turn in yourself

Which Dick was glad enough to do as he was quite tired The remainder
of the night passed without incident and when morning came the airship
was put at her former speed fifty miles an hour That may not sound
very fast but it must be remembered that this rate had to be kept up
for sixty hours straight perhaps

After breakfast the wire that had shocked Grit was renewed and then
some observations were taken to determine their position It was
calculated they were about halfway across Indiana by noon

The afternoon was slowly waning and they were preparing for their
second night of the prize trip congratulating themselves that they had
not yet been forced to descend

Suddenly Larry who was at the wheel uttered a cry of alarm

Somethings wrong he shouted I cant steer her on the course any
longer Shes heading North instead of West

Dick and Mr Vardon rushed to the pilothouse A glance at the compass
confirmed Larrys statement The aviator himself took the wheel but
it was impossible to head the craft West She pointed due North

The horizontal rudder is out of gear cried Dick

Yes and well have to go down to fix it said Mr Vardon after a
quick inspection Boys weve got to make our first landing Its too
bad but it might be worse



CHAPTER XXVI

ON LAKE MICHIGAN

Unsuccessfully they tried to make repairs to the horizontal rudder
without going down but it was not to be The airship was being sent
farther and farther along on a Northern course taking her far out of
her way And more time and distance might thus be lost than by
descending making repairs and going on again

Well I did hope wed cover at least half the trip before we had to go
down Dick said and his tone was regretful Try once more and see
if we cant get her back on the course

But the horizontal guideby which I mean the apparatus that sent the
craft to left or rightwas hopelessly jammed To try to force it
might mean a permanent break

Take her down Dick finally gave the order as captain What sort
of a landingplace is below us

Were too far up to see said Mr Vardon

And I hope we have the luck to be above open country We cant go to
left or right except in the smallest degree so well have to land
wherever Fate disposes We are all right on going up or down but not
otherwise

The vertical rudder was now depressed and on a long slant Dicks
airship was sent down Lower and lower she glided and soon an
indistinct mass appeared It was almost dusk and no details could be
made out Then as she went lower what appeared to be a gray cloud
showed

Theres a bank of fog below us declared Paul

Or else its the smoke of Pittsburg said Innis

We left Pittsburg behind long ago Larry returned Why he cried
as the gray foglike mass became more distinct Thats waterthats
what it is

Water exclaimed Dick Can we have gone in the wrong direction and
be back over the Atlantic

Or the Pacific suggested Larry with a laugh

No such good luck as that We havent had time to cross the continent
yet declared Dick But what water can it be

Oh some small lake spoke Paul

It isnt a small lakeits a big onean inland sea was Dicks
opinion as they settled lower and lower

Its Lake Michigan thats what it is shouted Larry after a quick
glance at the map Fellows were over Lake Michigan

And were going to be IN itor on itin a little while Im
thinking Lieutenant McBride said grimly Are you ready for a bath

There wont be any trouble about that answered Dick The
hydroplanes will take care of us I only hope it isnt too rough to
make a safe landing

Paul took a telescope from the rack and going out on the deck looked
down The next moment he reported

Its fairly calm Just a little swell on

Then wed better get ready to lower the hydroplanes went on Dick
with a look at the aviator

Thats the best thing to do decided Mr Vardon Well see how
theyll work in big water

The hydroplanes which were attached to the airship near the points
where the starting wheels were made fast could be lowered into place
by means of levers in the cabin The hydroplanes were really
watertight hollow boxes large and buoyant enough to sustain the
airship on the surface of the water They could be lowered to a point
where they were beneath the bicycle wheels and were fitted with
togglejointed springs to take up the shock

Lieutenant McBride took out his watch and with pad and pencil prepared
to note the exact moment when the airship should reach the surface of
the lake

I shall have to take official notice of this he said It
constitutes your first landing though perhaps it would be more correct
to call it a watering As soon as you are afloat your elapsed time
will begin and it will count until you are in the air again You will
probably be some time making repairs

No longer than we can help said Dick I dont want Uncle Ezra or
anybody else to get ahead of me

Down and down sank the Abaris on her first descent from the cloudland
since her auspicious start But as Dick admitted it might be worse
The accident itself was a comparatively slight one

Get ready everybody called Mr Vardon as he saw that in a few
seconds more they would be on the surface of the water

Do you fear something will go wrong asked Larry quickly

Well weve never tried the hydroplanes in rough water and there is
always the chance for an accident Stand out where you can jump if
you have to he directed

Lieutenant McBride was standing with his watch out ready to note the
exact second of landing He knew he must be officially correct though
he would give Dick every possible chance and favor

Here we go came the cry from the aviator Only a few seconds now

They could plainly see the heaving waters of the big lake Fortunately
it was comparatively calm though once she had landed the airship could
stand some rough weather afloat

Splash went the hydroplanes into the water The springs took up the
shock and strain and the next moment Dicks craft was floating easily
on the great lake The landing had been made without an accident to
mar it

Good cried Lieutenant McBride as he jotted down the time Do you
know how long you have been so far Dick on the trip

How long

Just thirtyfive hours four minutes and eight seconds was the
answer

Over half the estimated time gone and we re only a third of the way
there exclaimed the young millionaire Im afraid we arent going
to do it Mr Vardon

Well Im not going to give up yet the aviator answered grimly
This is only a start We havent used half our speed and when we get
closer to the finish we can go a hundred and twentyfive miles an hour
if we have tofor a spurt at any rate No Im not giving up

Neither am I declared Dick for he was not of the quitting sort

Floating on the surface of Lake Michigan was like being on the ocean
for they were out of sight of land and there were no water craft in
view The Abaris seemed to have the lake to herself though doubtless
beyond the wall of the slight haze that hemmed her in there were other
vessels

Well now to see what the trouble is suggested Dick It must be
somewhere in the connecting joints of the levers for the rudder itself
seems to be all right

But wed better begin out there and make sure suggested Mr Vardon
He pointed to the rudder which projected some distance back of the
stern of the aircraft

How you going to get at it to inspect it asked Paul It isnt as
if we were on solid ground

And no one has long enough a reach to stretch to it from the deck
added Innis

You forget our collapsible lifeboat Dick answered One of those
useful craft was aboard the airship It could be inflated with air
and would sustain a considerable weight

Ill go out in that and see whats the trouble Dick went on It
will tell us where weve got to begin

Perhaps we had better wait until morning suggested Lieutenant
McBride It is fast getting dark and you can do much better work in
daylight Besides you are not pressed for time as your stay here
will not count against you I think you had better wait until morning

And stay here all night asked Dick

I think so You have proved that your hydroplanes are all right Why
not rest on the surface of the lake until morning You cant anchor
it is true but you can use a drag and there seems to be no wind so
you will not be blown ashore Besides you can to a certain extent
control yourself with the propellers

I think we will wait then decided the young millionaire captain As
you say we can make a drag anchor to keep us from drifting too much

By means of a long rope a drag anchor was tossed out at the stern of
the aircraft This would serve to hold her back Then as nothing
further could be done preparations were made for supper

Well this aeroplaning has its ups and downs said Paul with a
laugh as he sat at table Last night we were eating up in the air
and now were on the water

And its lucky were not IN the water exclaimed Innis Regular
Hamilton luck I call it

No its Vardon luck Dick insisted He planned the hydroplanes
that made it possible

Lights were set aglow to show the position of the craft on the water

We dont want to be run down in the night Dick said as he noted the
red and green side lights as well as the white ones at bow and stern
For in the water the Abaris was subject to the same rules as were
other lake craft It was only when in the air that she was largely a
law unto herself

The night passed quietly enough though it came on to blow a little
toward morning But the drag anchor worked well

And now for the repairs cried Dick after breakfast as he and his
chums got out the collapsible boat It was blown up and in it Dick
and Mr Vardon paddled out to the stern rudders

They were examining the universal joint by which the apparatus was
deflected when Dick suddenly became aware of a wet feeling about his
feet and a sinking feeling beneath him He looked down and found
that the boat in which he and Mr Vardon were standing was going
down Already it was half filled with water

More trouble cried Dick I guess well have to swim for it



CHAPTER XXVII

A HOWLING GALE

There was no doubt about it The little craft was going down Later it
was learned that a leaky valve had allowed the air to escape and a
break in the boats rubber sides had let in the water

Come on cried Dick Overboard Mr Vardon

There was really little danger as both of them could swim though if
they did not jump out they might be carried down with the boat

So overboard went Dick and his aviator The collapsible boat sank
with the downward impulse given it when they leaped out but as it was
moored to the airship by a cable it could be recovered

Say what is thisa swimming race asked Paul as he tossed Dick a
rope a like service being performed for Mr Vardon by Innis

Looks like itdoesnt it agreed the young millionaire I should
have tested that boat before we went out in it he added as he
clambered up Grit frisking and barking about him in delight

Yes thats where we made the mistake agreed Mr Vardon That
rubber must have been cut as it was packed away Well we can easily
mend it so no great harm is done

By means of the cable the sunken boat was pulled to the airship and
when the water was allowed to run out it was hauled aboard Then it was
examined the leak found and the craft was placed out in the sun to
dry after which it could be mended

Well we cant do anything but wait said Dick after he had changed
into dry garments The break is out on that part of the rudder thats
over the water We cant reach it without the boat

Then while were waiting lets have a swim proposed Paul It will
do us all good

And then we can do some fishing added Innis Id like some nice
broiled fish Did you bring any tackle along Dick

No Im sorry to say I didnt

Then Ill have to rig up some Ill use some cold canned chicken for
bait

What about a hook asked Lieutenant McBride with a smile

Well anybody who can build an airship ought to be able to make a fish
hook Im going to call on Dick for that went on Innis

I guess I can file you out one from a bit of steel wire answered the
young millionaire

This was done after some little labor and with several of the
improvised barbs and bait from some of the canned goods a fishing
party was organized There was plenty of string and for leaders so
that the fish would not bite off the hooks Innis used some spare banjo
strings He had brought his instrument along with him

The swim was much enjoyed for the day was warm The young aviators
sported around in the cool waters of the lake and several little
spurting races were pulled off to use a sporting term

I cannot say that the fishing was very successful A few were caught
but I imagine the bait used was not just proper It is difficult to
get canned chicken to stick on a hook unless you use a piece of
gristle But some good specimens were caught and were served for
dinner being fried on the electric stove

All this while the airship floated tranquilly on the surface of the
lake Several vessels came near attracted by the strange sight of
Dicks craft but by means of a megaphone they were kindly asked not
to approach too near as the least contact with one of the heavier
craft would damage the Abaris Through the captain of one craft Dick
sent a message to his father and Larry a story to his paper

Well I think that boat must be dry enough to mend now said Dick
some time after dinner We dont want to spend another night here if
we can help it

No for the weather might not always be as calm as it is now The
barometer is falling and that means a storm sooner or later spoke
Mr Vardon And these lake storms can be pretty had when they try

It was found that the collapsible boat was dry enough to patch up and
by means of a rubber cement the hole in the side was closed

The leaky intake valve was also repaired and then when the peculiar
craft was blown up and tested it was found to be all right

Now well have another try at fixing that rudder said Dick as he
and the aviator started once more to paddle to the stern of the
aircraft

This time all went well No water came in the rubber boat and by
standing up in it the two were able to learn the cause of the trouble
with the rudder

It was simple enougha broken bolt making it impossible to turn it in
a certain direction As Dick had plenty of spare parts aboard a new
bolt was soon substituted for the fractured one and then they were
ready to proceed again

Ive a suggestion to make said Lieutenant McBride when Dick was
about to give the word to mount into the air again

What is it asked the young millionaire

Why not try your boat over the water While it is not exactly a
hydroplane yet it has those attachments and you can probably skim
over the surface of the water as well as float on it And that might
come in useful in winning the prize

Of course the conditions call for an air flight from New York to San
Francisco but I believe in case of emergency a short water trip
would not count against you And you might have to make it some time

Ill see what we can do at any rate decided Dick We will
probably never get a better chance than this Come on boys Well
see how our hydroplanes act he called

The only thing that was necessary to do was to start the motor that
operated the propellers The aircraft was at this time resting easily
on the surface of Lake Michigan

She would be driven forward by the propellers beating on the air
exactly as a sailboat it aided by the wind Only in her case the
Abaris would furnish her own motive power

In anticipation of some time having to navigate on the water a small
auxiliary rudder had been attached to Dicks craft This rudder went
down into the water and would be used in steering in conjunction with
those used when she was in the air

This wooden rudder was now dropped into the water tested and found to
answer properly to the lever which in the pilothouse controlled it
by means of wire ropes

Well let her go cried Dick and well see what sort of luck well
have

Which way asked Mr Vardon who was at the wheel

Why not head for Chicago suggested Lieutenant McBride We cant be
a great way from there according to the map and that would be a good
place to make the new start from

I think it would be agreed Dick if that would be covering the
conditions of the contest

Well you can easily travel back enough to make up any shortage in
miles the army man went on You still have plenty of time

So this was agreed to and after a look over the craft to make sure
there were no defects Mr Vardon pulled over the lever of the starting
motor

With a hum and a buzz the propellers started and this time the Abaris
shot forward on the surface of the water instead of up into the air

Shes going cried Paul

She sure is doing it yelled Innis

Yes I think shes as successful on the waves as he was in the
clouds agreed Dick as he looked at a speedmeasuring gage Were
hitting up forty miles an hour right now

And thats good speed for a craft of this size in the water or
rather on top of the water declared Lieutenant McBride

For a hydroplane craft as you probably know does not go through the
water as a motorboat does A regular hydroplane is fitted with a
series of graduated steps and the front of the boat rises as it skims
over the water But all hydroplane craft are designed to slip over the
surface of the water and not to cleave through it And it was the
former that Dicks craft was doing

Faster and faster speed was attained until there could be no question
about the second success of the young millionaires airship If ever
occasion should require that he take to the water in an emergency it
could be done

And now for Chicago Dick cried when several hours had been spent in
maneuvering about each member of the party taking turns at steering
And I think well go up in the air for that trip he added

Theres an aero club in the outskirts of Chicago explained
Lieutenant McBride I am a member of it and I think we could make a
call there It would not be necessary to cross the city and of course
we will not land

It was agreed that this would be a good plan and Dick taking the
wheel sent his craft ahead on the lake at fast speed

Here we go up he suddenly cried Then yanking over the lever of
the elevating rudder he sent the Abaris aloft The rudder for sideway
steering worked perfectly now that repairs had been made

Up up into the air soared the big biplane and from the lake she had
left came a blast of saluting whistles from the watercraft that thus
paid tribute to a sister vessel

During the wait on the water Dick had purchased from a passing steamer
a supply of gasolene and oil

Now well have enough so we wont have to land to take on any more
he said Our provisions are holding out well and if nothing happens
we can make the trip from here to San Francisco without stop

But we still have one landing to our credit if we need it said Paul

Oh yes but I hope we dont have to use it went on Dick It will
be so much more to our credit if we dont

The supposition that they were not far from Chicago proved correct for
when they had arisen above the mist that suddenly spread over Lake
Michigan they saw in the distance the Windy City

A course was laid to circle about it and not cross it as that might
complicate matters and a little later they were within view of the
aviation grounds of which club Lieutenant McBride was a member

He had said there might be a meet in progress and this proved to be
so A number of biplanes and monoplanes were circling about and the
big crowd in attendance leaped to its feet in astonishment at the sight
of the young millionaires new and powerful craft

It was not the intention of Dick and his chums to stop and make a
landing but they wanted to get some news of other competing craft
which might be trying for the big prize Accordingly a plan was
evolved by which this could be done

The lieutenant wrote out a brief account of their trip telling of the
stop and to this Larry added a request that after it had been read
it might be telegraphed to his paper Then information was asked for
in regard to aerial matters

But how are we going to get information from them asked Paul We
cant get our wireless to working we cant hear them even with
megaphones wigwagging wont do and were not going to land

Ive asked them to send up a bunch of toy balloons carrying any
message they can send us the lieutenant said I think we can
manipulate our craft so as to grab some of the balloons as they float
upward Ive seen it done

Little time was lost over this The message was dropped down in one of
Larrys leather cylinders It was seen to be picked up and while Dick
and his friends circled about above the aviation grounds their note was
read An answer was hastily prepared to be sent up as Lieutenant
McBride had suggested

Meanwhile a number of the other aeroplanes whizzed past close to
Dicks

I hope they dont come so close that theyll collide with us
murmured the young millionaire But the pilots were skillful They
tried to shout what were probably congratulations or questions at the
transcontinental party but the motors of the small biplanes made such
a racket it was impossible to hear

Here come the balloons cried Dick as he saw a group tied together
floating upward Now to get them Youd better handle her Mr
Vardon

No you do it Dick Ill stand out on deck and try to grab them

We can all reach from windows suggested Paul for there were windows
in the cabin

Dick was so successful in maneuvering his craft that Mr Vardon had no
trouble at all in catching the messagecarrying toy balloons The note
was brief It conveyed the greeting of the aeroclub and stated that
a number of competing craft were on their way west

The Larabee leads according to last reports read Innis

That must be Uncle Ezras machine murmured Dick Hes right after
us Well wed better get on our course again

I think so agreed Mr Vardon The Abaris was sent in a Westerly
direction once more and those aboard settled down to what they hoped
would be the last lap of the big race

But matters were not destined to be as easy and comfortable as they
hoped for Soon after supper that night the wind sprang up It
increased in violence until at ten oclock there was a howling gale
through which the airship had to fight her way with almost all her
available power

Some wind cried Dick when he went on duty and glancing at the
gage noted it to be blowing at seventy miles an hour

Luckily it isnt altogether dead against us said Mr Vardon As it
is though its cutting down our speed to about twenty miles an hour
and I dont want to force the engine too much

No agreed Dick It isnt worth while especially as the gale is
serving the other craft just as it is us



CHAPTER XXVIII

ABLAZE IN THE CLOUDS

There was small consolation however for those aboard Dicks craft in
the thought that other competing airships were in the same plight as
themselves For as the night wore on the wind seemed to increase in
power Only the mechanical strength of the Abaris enabled her to
weather the storm

We could not possible do it were it not for the gyroscope stabilizer
declared Lieutenant McBride We would be on our beams ends all the
while Its a great invention

Well this certainly is a good test of it agreed Mr Vardon with
pardonable pride

Indeed no more severe strain could have been put upon the apparatus
There would come a great gust of the tornado and the ship would begin
to heel over But the marvelous power of the gyroscope would force her
back again

On through the night and through the gale went the airship So severe
was the storm that it was not deemed wise for any one to remain in his
bunk So everyone spent the hours of darkness in wakeful watching and
waiting

We want to be ready to act in any emergency explained Mr Vardon
Theres no telling when something may give way under the strain

Well then we ought to go over all the machinery every ten minutes or
so and see if anything is wrong suggested Dick We might see the
trouble starting in time to prevent it

Good idea cried the lieutenant Well make periodical inspections
Everyone on the job as the boys say

The task of looking after the machinery was divided up among the young
aviators and as the craft was swayed this way and that by the gale
eager and anxious eyes watched every revolution of the gear wheels
pistons were minutely inspected in the light of electric torches and
valves adjusted when they showed the least sign of going wrong

Poor Grit seemed to be afraid which was something new for him He
would not leave Dick for an instant but kept at his heels even when
his master went near the sparking motors and dynamos which the bulldog
had good reason to fear But now he seemed more afraid of something
else than the machines that had shocked him

I wonder whats the matter spoke the young millionaire I never
saw him act this way before What is it old boy he asked soothingly

Grit whined uneasily

Sometimes animals have premonitions said Mr Vardon I remember
once in my early days of flying I took a dog up with me

Everything seemed to be going along fine but the dog showed signs of
uneasiness though it wasnt on account of the height for hed been up
before But it wasnt five minutes later before one of my propeller
blades broke off and I nearly turned turtle before I could make a
landing

I hope nothing like that occurs now said Larry It might make a
good story but it would be a mighty uncomfortable feeling

I dont anticipate anything said the aviator We seem to be doing
very well But we are making scarcely any progress and we are being
blown considerably off our course

Well make it up when the wind stops Dick said Im determined to
win that prize

This is a peculiar storm Lieutenant McBride observed It seems to
be nothing but wind Im inclined to think there had been an area of
low pressure about this region caused possibly by some other storm
and the air from another region is now rushing in filling up the
partial vacuum

In that case we might try to rise above it suggested Mr Vardon
Ive often done that We could go up It would not be advisable to
go down any lower as we dont want to run the risk of colliding with
any mountains and we are getting pretty well to the Northwest now
Suppose we try to go up

This was agreed on as a wise plan and Dick who was taking his turn at
the wheel shifted the rudder to send his craft up on a long slant

But now a new difficulty arose It seemed that the change in angle
made a heavier wind pressure on the big planes and the speed of the
airship was reduced to a bare ten miles an hour In fact she seemed
almost stationary in the air at times

This wont do cried Dick Weve got to turn on more power even if
we do strain the machinery Weve got to have more speed than this

Thats right cried Mr Vardon Ill turn em up Dick

And with the increased speed of the big motor that was whirling the
propellers came increased danger of a break Vigilance was redoubled
and they had their reward for their care

Heres something wrong cried Innis as he passed a small dynamo that
supplied current for the electric lights A hot bearing and he
pointed to where one was smoking

Shut down Quick cried Mr Vardon Throw over the storage battery
switch That will run the lights until that shaft cools It must have
run out of oil

The dynamo was stopped and as the storage battery was not powerful
enough to operate all the lights for very long only part of the
incandescents were used so that the interior of the ship was only
dimly lighted

Use your portable electric torches to examine the machinery in the
dark places directed the aviator Well use the dynamo again as
soon it cools

This machine going out of commission had no effect on the progress of
the airship She was still fighting her way upward with Dick at the
wheel and Grit crouching uneasily near him The dog gave voice
occasionally to pitiful whines

What is it old boy asked Dick Is something wrong

And Grits manner showed very plainly that there was But what it was
no one could guess

How is she coming Dick asked Innis a little later Can I relieve
you

No Im not tired Its only a nervous sort of feeling I feel as if
I were trying to push the airship along

I know how it is murmured the cadet

But just take it easy How is she doing

Better I think We seem to be gaining a little If we could only
get above the gale wed be all right But its hard forcing her up
Id just like to know how Uncle Ezra is making out

As a matter of fact as Dick learned later his relative had no easy
time of it He had gotten off in fair weather and under good
circumstances but engine trouble developed after the first few hours
and while he and Larson with the army man did not have to come down
they could only fly at slow speed

I dont know whats the matter with the thing said Larson Im
afraid well have to use even a different carburetor

What And spend more money cried Uncle Ezra I guess not No
sir Up to date this machine has cost me nigh on to eleven thousand
dollars Ive got it all down

But youll double your money and have a fine machine to sell to the
government said Larson It will be all right Give me money for a
larger carburetor

Well if I have to I have to I suppose sighed the miserly old man
But try and make this one do

It would not answer however and after trying in vain to get more
speed out of the craft Larson was obliged to use one of the two
allowed descents and go down to readjust the motor

Then when a couple of days had elapsed though of course this time was
not counted any more than in the case of Dick another start was made
The Larabee as Uncle Ezra had called his craft seemed to do better
and at times she showed a spurt of speed that amazed even Larson
himself They passed several who had started ahead of them

Were sure to get that prize he exulted

Well I calalate if we dont therell be trouble declared Uncle
Ezra grimly

Then they had run into the storm as had Dicks craft and several
other competing ones and Larson the army man and Uncle Ezra were in
great difficulties But they forced their machine on

Of course Dick and his friends knew nothing of this at the time as
several hundred miles then separated the two airships

Onward and upward went the Abaris Now and then she seemed to gain on
the wind but it was a hard struggle

I think were going to do it though declared Dick as he went about
with the aviator looking at and testing the various pieces of
machinery Our speed has gone up a little and the wind pressure
seems less

It is a little agreed Mr Vardon But what is worrying me is that
well have a lot of lost time and distance to make up when we get out
of this storm Still I suppose it cant be helped

Indeed not Were lucky as it is admitted the young millionaire
But Im going to get Innis and make some coffee I think it will do
us all good

The electric stove was soon aglow and a little later the aromatic odor
of coffee pervaded the cabin of the airship Some sandwiches were also
made

And thus while the craft was fighting her way through the gale those
aboard ate a midnight lunch with as good appetites as though they were
on solid ground For in spite of the fact that they were in the midst
of danger they were fairly comfortable True the aircraft was tilted
upward for she was still climbing on a steep slant but they had
gotten used to this The gyroscope stabilizer prevented any rolling
from side to side

Maybe Grit is hungry and thats whats bothering him said Dick as
he tossed the dog a bit of canned chicken But though the animal was
usually very fond of this delicacy he now refused it

Thats queer mused Dick I cant understand that Something
surely must be wrong I hope he isnt going to be sick

Had we better go any higher asked Innis at the wheel as he noted
the hand on the gage Were up nearly nine thousand feet now and

Hold her there cried Mr Vardon If weve gone up that far and we
havent gotten beyond the gale there isnt much use trying any more
Well ride it out at that level

Indeed the Abaris was very high and some of the party had a little
difficulty in breathing Grit too was affected this way and it
added to his uneasiness

If we had some means of making the cabin airtight we could make the
air pressure in here just what we wanted it regardless of the rarefied
atmosphere outside said Dick In my next airship Ill have that
done

Not a bad idea agreed Mr Vardon It could be arranged

The night was wearing on and as the first pale streaks of dawn showed
through the celluloid windows of the cabin it was noticed by the wind
gage that the force of the gale was slacking

Weve ridden it out exulted Dick Shes a good old airship after
all Now we can get back on our course We ought to be crossing the
Rockies soon and then for the last stage of the trip to San Francisco

Oh weve got considerable distance yet to cover said the aviator
I fancy we were blown nearly five hundred miles out of our way and
thats going to take us several hours to make good on

Still you are doing well said the army man No airship has ever
made a transcontinental flight and there is no speed record to go by
So you may win after all especially as the storm was so general

It was rapidly getting light now and as they looked they saw that they
were above the clouds They were skimming along in a sea of fleecy
white mist

First call for breakfast cried Dick His tones had scarcely died
away when there came a howl from Grit who was standing near the
compartment of the main motor

What is the matter with that dog asked Dick in a puzzled voice
Grits howl changed to a bark and at the same moment Larry Dexter
who was passing cried out

Fire Theres a fire in the motorroom Where are the extinguishers

A black cloud of smoke rushed out enveloping Grit who howled dismally



CHAPTER XXIX

THE RIVAL AIRSHIP

What did it

Had we better descend

Everybody get busy

Fire extinguishers here

These and other confused cries sounded throughout the airship
following Larrys alarm

No dont go down shouted Mr Vardon Well stay up as long as we
can Well fight the fire in the airabove the clouds

Hold her steady Innis called Dick to his chum who was at the wheel

Steady she is was the grim answer

And while the Abaris was rushing onward those aboard her prepared to
fight that most deadly of enemiesfireand at a terrible
disadvantagenearly ten thousand feet in the air

Fortunately preparations had been made for this emergency and a number
of portable extinguishers were placed in various places on the walls of
the cabin

These the young aviators now pulled down and rushed with them to the
motor compartment from which the black smoke was pouring in greater
volume

Look out for a gasolene explosion warned the lieutenant Is there
any of it there

Only a little answered Mr Vardon The main supply is in the deck
tank But there is a small can in there for priming the cylinders in
case we have to

It smells like oil afire said Larry Dexter

Thats what it isprobably some oily waste started by spontaneous
combustion said Mr Vardon

As he spoke he threw the contents of his extinguisher inside the motor
compartmentit was hardly large enough to be called a room The smoke
was so black that no blaze could be seen

Open some of the windows shouted Paul Its choking in here

Thats right agreed Larry with a cough and a sneeze

Stoop downget near the floor of the cabin ordered the army
lieutenant The air is always more pure there

He too emptied the contents of his extinguisher in the compartment
and his example was followed by the others The smoke seemed to be
less now and much of it went out through the opened windows which
Paul slid back in their groves

Theres the blaze cried Dick as he saw through the lessening haze
of smoke some bright red tongues of fire

Douse it cried Paul handing his chum a fresh extinguisher for Dick
had used his

The young millionaire threw on the chemical powder for this happened
to be that sort of an extinguisher and almost instantly there followed
a sharp explosion

Look out yelled Dick ducking instinctively I guess this is the
end of everything

But to the surprise of all the motor still kept up its hum and they
could tell by the feel of the craft that she was still progressing
The gale had now almost completely died out and the Abaris was making
good time and on her proper course when the fire was discovered

The fire is scattered Dick yelled as he rose up and took another
look in the motorroom I guess it was only that little tank of
gasolene that went up Afterward this was found to be so

The blazing liquid however had scattered all about the motor
compartment Fortunately the walls were of steel so that the fiery
stuff could burn itself out without doing much damage

More extinguishers yelled Dick as he saw the spots of fire about
the motor First thing we know some of the insulation will be burned
off and well have a short circuit

The motorroom was almost free of smoke now and there were only a few
scattered spots of fire Standing in the entrance Dick threw the
contents of several extinguishers inside as they were passed to him
and he had the satisfaction of seeing the flames gradually choked by
the chemical fumes thus released

Now I guess were all right said Mr Vardon when no more fire could
be seen And the marvel of it is that our motor never stopped

Thats the one thing that saved us from making another descentour
last murmured Dick Thats sure some motor all right

But they were congratulating themselves too soon it seemed For
hardly had Dick spoken than the monotonous whine of the powerful
machine seemed to weaken in tone It died outthe high note sunk to a
low one and gradually went out

Whats up now asked Paul peering over Dicks shoulder The motor
compartment was still too hot to enter with safety and it was also
filled with acrid vapor from the extinguishers

IIm afraid its going to stop gasped Dick for he was out of
breath from his exertions and from the excitement of the occasion

Stop cried Paul If she does well have to go down

And stop the motor did There was a sort of final groan or gasp as if
of apology and then the wheels stopped revolving and the big
propellers outside the cabin which had been forcing the craft onward
gradually ceased their motion

Quick shouted Mr Vardon Throw on the selfstarter Dick We may
catch her before she loses all her momentum

All right answered Dick He made one jump to the switch that put
into commission the electrical starter But he was too late to catch
the motor It had died down and though the young millionaire made
contact after contact with the copper knifeswitch there was no
response

Were falling cried Innis from the pilothouse as he noted the
height gage and saw that the hand was constantly receding Were
falling Dick

I know itno help for it answered our hero hopelessly

The Abaris was certainly going down When the propellers had ceased to
urge her forward she began to dip toward the earth even as a stone
falls when the initial impulse from the sling or the hand of the
thrower is lost

Foot by foot she dropped and those aboard her looked helplessly at one
another They had made a brave fight against the fire but it seemed
to have gone for naught They could not keep up with the motor stalled
as it was

I guess well have to make another landing said Innis as he
remained at the wheel

Of course they were entitled to one more but it would be the last and
a long and hard part of their transcontinental flight was still ahead
of them If they went down this time and after making repairs came
up into the air once more they would not under the rules be allowed
to land again before reaching San Francisco

Its tough luck but I guess well have to do it said Larry Dexter

Maybe not Dick cried I have an idea

What is it Tell us quick begged Innis for he as well as all of
Dicks friends wanted to see him win the prize

I think the insulation has been burning off some of the wires of the
motor was his answer That would make a short circuit and put it
out of business Now if we can only keep afloat long enough to change
those wires we may be able to start the motor again and keep on our
way before we touch ground

Youve struck it cried Mr Vardon Dick you take charge of the
wheelyou and any of your friends you want Ill look over the motor
and make repairs if I can

And theyll have to be made pretty soon called out Innis from the
pilothouse Were falling fast

Throw her nose up cried Dick Thats what weve got to do to save
ourselves Well volplane down and maybe we can keep up long enough
to have Mr Vardon put in new wires in place of the burnedout ones
If he can do that and if we can start the motor

It sounds too good to be true said Innis But get in here Dick
and see what you can do Youve got to volplane as you never did
before

And Im going to do it cried the young millionaire

The motorroom was now free from smoke and the fire was out A pile
of charred waste in one corner showed where it had started

Thats the troubleinsulation burned off cried Mr Vardon as he
made a quick inspection I think I can fix it Dick if you can keep
her up long enough Take long glides Were up a good height and
that will help solve

Then began a curious battle against fate and not only a struggle
against adverse circumstances but against gravitation For now that
there was no forward impulse in the airship she could not overcome the
law that Sir Isaac Newton discovered which law is as immutable as
death Nothing can remain aloft unless it is either lighter than the
air itself or unless it keeps in motion with enough force to overcome
the pull of the magnet earth which draws all things to itself

I have told you how it is possible for a body heavier than air to
remain above the earth as long as it is in motion It is this which
keeps cannon balls and airships upmotion Though of course
airships with their big spread of surface need less force to keep
them from falling than do projectiles

And when the motor of an airship stops it is only by volplaning down
or descending in a series of slanting shifts that accidents are
avoided

This then is what Dick did He would let the airship shoot downward
on a long slant so as to gain as much as possible Then by throwing
up the headrudder he would cause his craft to take an upward turn
thus delaying the inevitable descent

All the while this was going on Mr Vardon aided by Lieutenant
McBride was laboring hard to replace the burnedout wires He worked
frantically for he knew he had but a few minutes at the best From
the height at which they were when the motor stopped it would take them
about ten minutes to reach the earth holding back as Dick might And
there was work which in the ordinary course of events would take
twice as long as this

Im only going to make a shift at it explained the aviator If I
can only get in temporary wires I can replace them later

Thats right agreed the army man

How you making it Dick asked Larry as he came to the door of the
pilothouse

Well Ive got five hundred feet left If he cant get the motor
going before we go down that far

Dick did not finish but they all knew what he meant

Another second and Ill have the last wire in cried Mr Vardon Do
your best Dick

Im doing it But shes dipping down fast

Oh for a dirigible balloon now cried the lieutenant We could
float while making repairs

But it was useless to wish for that They must do the best they could
under the circumstances

There she is The last wire in shouted the aviator How much
space left Dick

About two hundred feet

That may do it Now to see if the selfstarter will work

Eagerly he made a jump for the switch He pulled it over There was a
brilliant blue spark as the gap was closed

The electrical starter hummed and whined as if in protest at being
obliged to take up its burden again

Then with a hum and a roar the motor that had stalled began to
revolve Slowly at first but soon gathering speed

Throw in the propeller clutch yelled Dick Were going right
toward a hill and I cant raise her any more

In she goes yelled Lieutenant McBride as he pulled on the lever

There was a grinding of gears as the toothed wheels meshed and the big
wooden propellers began to revolve

There she goes cried Mr Vardon

The Abaris which had almost touched the earth began to soar upward
under the propelling influence Dick tilted back the elevating plane
as far as he dared

Had the motive power come in time or would they land on the hill

But success was with them Up went the big airship Up and up flying
onward Her fall had been checked

And only just in time for they went over the brow of the hill but with
a scant twenty feet to spare So close had they come to making a
landing

I congratulate you cried Lieutenant McBride I thought surely you
would go down He had out his pencil and paper to make a note of the
time of landing It would have been the last one allowed and it would
seriously have handicapped Dick But he had escaped and still had
some reserve to his credit

And now I guess we can eat said the young millionaire with a sigh
of relief

A quick bite only stipulated Mr Vardon Some of those wires I
put in last are a disgrace to an electrician I want to change them
right away They wont stand the vibration

Well coffee and sandwiches anyhow said Dick and the simple meal
was soon in progress

Steadily the airship again climbed up toward the clouds from which she
had so nearly fallen And with a sandwich and a cup of coffee beside
him Mr Vardon worked at the wires putting in permanent ones in place
of the temporary conductors This could be done without stopping the
motor

I wonder if it was the fire Grit was anticipating all the while he
acted so queer asked Innis

I dont knowbut it was something Dick said I shouldnt wonder
but what he did have some premonition of it Anyhow you gave the
alarm in time old boy and he patted his pet on the back

Grit waved his tail and barked He seemed himself again

It took some time to make good the damage done by the fire and it was
accomplished as the airship was put back on her course again and sent
forward toward the Pacific coast They were all congratulating
themselves on their narrow escape from possible failure

It was that same afternoon when Mr Vardon had finished his task that
something else happened to cause them much wonderment

The motor was again in almost perfect condition and was running well
Most of the party were out on the deck behind the cabin enjoying the
air for the day had been hot and they were tired from fighting the
tire

Suddenly Grit who was in the pilothouse with Dick ran out into the
main cabin and looking from one of the windows which he could do by
jumping up in a chair he began to bark violently

Well whats the matter now demanded Dick Is it another fire

Grit barked so persistently that Dick called to Paul

See what ails him will you He must have caught sight of something
out of the window

I should say he had yelled Paul a moment later Heres a rival
airship after us Dick



CHAPTER XXX

AN ATTACK

Pauls announcement created considerable excitement Though they had
covered a large part of their trip the young aviators had not yet seen
any of their competitors As a matter of fact Dicks craft was among
the first to get away in the transcontinental race But he had feared
several times that he might be overtaken by lighter and speedier
machines

Now it seemed his fears were about to be realized For the big
biplane that Grit had first spied could be none other than one of
those engaged in a try for the twentythousanddollar prize They were
now nearing the Rockies and it was not likely that any lone aviator
would be flying in that locality unless he were after the government
money

Another airship eh cried Dick Let me get a look at her Someone
take the wheel please

Ill relieve you offered Lieutenant McBride whose official duties
allowed him to do this Go see if you can make out who she is Dick

The approaching craft had come up from the rear and to one side so
she could not be observed from the pilothouse in front

Catching up a pair of powerful fieldglasses Dick went to where Paul
stood with Grit looking out of the celluloid window By this time
some of the others had also gathered there

Its a big machine all right murmured Innis

And there are three aviators in her added Paul

Can you make out who they are Dick asked Larry Dexter

No they have on protecting helmets and goggles replied the young
millionaire as he adjusted the binoculars to his vision But Im
sure I know that machine

Whose is it Innis wanted to know

Well I dont want to be too positive but Im pretty certain thats
my Uncle Ezras craft replied Dick slowly

Great Scott cried Paul Is it possible Oh its possible all
right Dick made answer but I did not think he would really take
part in this race However he seems to have done so I cant make
him out but thats just the shape of his airship I can tell by the
mercury stabilizer Larson has put on

Well it looks as if wed have a race observed Mr Vardon

He sure is speeding on mused Dick

But he may be away behind his schedule put in Larry

That wont make any difference the young millionaire said He
started after we did and if he gets to San Francisco ahead of us and
with only two landings hell win the prize That stands to reason
Hes making better time than we are

Mr Vardon took the glasses from Dick and made a long observation
When he lowered them he remarked

I think that is the craft Larson built all right And it certainly
is a speedy one He must have met more favorable conditions of late
than we did or he never could have caught up to us

I guess so agreed Dick Now the point is What can we do

Speed upthats the only thing I see to do came from the aviator
We still have one landing left us but we dont need to use it unless
we have to We have fuel and oil enough for the trip to San Francisco
Speed up I say and lets see if we cant get away from him

Weve got a heavier machine and more weight aboard spoke Dick

Say cant you drop us off cried Paul That would lighten you a
whole lot Let Innis and me go

Ill drop off too if it will help any Larry Dexter offered

And be killed asked Mr Vardon

Not necessarily You could run the airship over some lake or river
lower it as close as possible and we could drop into the water We
can all swim and dive You could drop us near shore we could get out
and make our way to the nearest town That would leave you with less
load to carry

I wouldnt think of it cried Dick

Why not asked Innis

In the first place I want my airship to do what I built it forcarry
this party across the continent If it cant do that and in time to
at least give me a chance for the government prize Im going to have
one that can In the second place even if your going off would help
me to win I wouldnt let you take the risk

No well stick together I think I can get away from Uncle Ezra if
thats who is in that biplane We can run up our speed considerable
We havent touched the extreme limit yet

Well if you wont you wontthat settles it said Paul But if
youre going to speed youd better begin He is sure coming on

Indeed the other aircraft was rushing toward them at a rapid rate It
had been some distance in the rear when first sighted but now the
three figures aboard were plainly discernable with the naked eye

Speed her up called Dick Weve got to leave him if we can

Gradually the Abaris forged on more rapidly But it seemed as if those
in the other craft were waiting for something like this For they
too put on more power and were soon overhauling the larger airship

Theyve got an awful lot of force in a light craft observed
Lieutenant McBride Shes over engined and isnt safe Even if your
uncle gets in ahead of you Dick I will still maintain that you have
the better outfit and the most practical I dont see how they can
live aboard that frail craft

It certainly did not look very comfortable and afterward Uncle Ezra
confessed that he endured many torments during the trip

The race was on in earnest They were over the Rockies now and at the
present rate of speed it would be only a comparatively short time
before they would be at the Pacific coast

If I only knew how many landings he had made I wouldnt be so
worried said Dick If hes had more than two hes out of it
anyhow and I wouldnt strain my engine

Wed better keep on advised Mr Vardon and they all agreed to this

Toward the close of the afternoon the Larabee which they were all sure
was the name of the craft in the rear came on with a rush Her speed
seemed increased by half and she would it was now seen quickly pass
the Abaris

Well theyre going ahead of us sighed Dick Uncle Ezra did better
than I thought he would

Neither he nor any of the others were prepared for what happened For
suddenly the other airship swooped toward Dicks craft in what was
clearly a savage attack Straight at the Abaris using all her speed
came Uncle Ezras airship



CHAPTER XXXI

THE WRECK

What do they mean

Whats their game anyhow

Theyll ram us if they dont look out

Maybe theyve lost control of her

Dick if thats your uncle tell him to watch where hes going

Thus cried those aboard the aircraft of the young millionaire as they
watched the oncoming of the rival craft She was certainly coming
straight at them It was intentional too for Mr Vardon who was at
the wheel of the Abaris quickly changed her course when he saw what
was about to happen and the other pilot could have had plenty of room
to pass in the air

Instead he altered his direction so as to coincide with that of Dicks
craft

They must be crazy

If theyll hit us well go to smash even if she is a lighter machine
than ours

Thus cried Paul and Innis as they stood beside Dick

Its my Uncle Ezra all right murmured the wealthy youth I can
recognize him now in spite of his helmet and goggles But what in the
world is he up to anyhow He cant really mean to ram us but it does
look so

The two airships were now but a short distance apart and in spite of
what Mr Vardon could do a collision seemed inevitable The fact of
the matter was that the Larabee being smaller and lighter answered
more readily to her rudders than did the Abaris

Weve got to have more speed Dick called the aviator Im going
to turn about and go down Its the only way to get out of their way
Theyre either crazy or bent on their own destruction as well as
ours Give me more speed Dick All you can

All right answered the young millionaire Well do our best to get
out of your way Uncle Ezra

As Dick hastened to the motorroom Grit trotted after him growling in
his deep voice at the mention of the name of the man he so disliked

Dick realized the emergency and turned the gasolene throttle wide
open With a throb and a roar the motor took up the increase and
whirled the big propellers with mighty force

Then in a last endeavor to prevent the collision Mr Vardon sent the
craft down at a sharp slant intending to dive under the other

But this move was anticipated by Larson who was steering the Larabee

He too sent his craft down but just when a collision seemed about to
take place it was prevented by Mr Vardon who was a more skillful
pilot

The propellers of the Abaris worked independently on a sort of
differential gear like the rear wheels of an automobile This enabled
her to turn very short and quickly by revolving one propeller in one
direction and one in the opposite as is done with the twin screws of
a steamer

And this move alone prevented what might have been a tragedy But it
was also the cause of a disaster to Dicks aircraft

With a rush and a roar the Larabee passed over the Abaris as she was so
suddenly turned and then something snapped in the machinery of the big
airship She lost speed and began to go down slightly

Did they hit us cried Dick in alarm

No but weve broken the sprocket chain on the port propeller
answered Mr Vardon

Well have to be content with half speed until we can make repairs
Come now everybody to work Those crazy folks may come back at
usthat is begging your pardon for calling your uncle crazy Dick

You cant offend me that way He MUST be crazy to act the way he did
I cant understand it Of course Larson was steering but my uncle
must have given him orders to do as he did and try to wreck us

I shall report whoever the army man was that did not make an attempt
to stop their attack on us declared Lieutenant McBride bitterly I
dont know who was assigned to the Larabee but he certainly ought to
be courtmartialed

Perhaps no army representative was aboard at all suggested Paul

There were three persons on the airship said Larry I saw them

And the race would not be counted unless an army representative was
aboard declared Lieutenant McBride So they would not proceed
without one No he must have been there and have entered into their
plot to try and wreck us I cant understand it

Theyve evidently given it up whatever their game was called Innis
See there they go

He pointed to the other airship which was now some distance away
going on at good speed straight for San Francisco Both craft were
now high in the air in spite of the drop made by the Abaris and they
were about over some of the mountains of Colorado now just where they
had not determined They were about eight hundred miles from San
Francisco as nearly as they could calculate

Theyre trying to get in first said Dick Maybe after all they
just wanted to frighten us and delay us

Well if that was their game theyve succeeded in delaying us said
Mr Vardon grimly Were reduced to half speed until we get that
propeller in commission again Theres work for all of us Reduce
sped Dick or we may tear the one good blade off the axle

With only half the resistance against it the motor was now racing
hard Dick slowed it down and then the work of repairing the broken
sprocket chain and gear was undertaken

It was not necessary to stop the airship to do this In fact to stop
meant to descend and they wanted to put that off as long as possible
They still had the one permitted landing to their credit

The propellers as I have said could be reached from the open deck
and thither Mr Vardon Dick and Lieutenant McBride took themselves
while Paul Innis and Larry would look after the progress of the craft
from the pilothouse and motorroom

Slowly Dicks airship went along just enough speed being maintained to
prevent her settling She barely held her own while far ahead of
her and fast disappearing in the distance could be seen the other
craftthat carrying Uncle Ezra

I guess its all up with us murmured Paul as he went to the wheel

No it isnt cried Dick Im not going to give up yet We can
still make time when we get the repairs made and Ill run the motor
until her bearings melt before I give up

Thats the way to talk cried the army man And were all with you
Theres a good chance yet for those fellows must be desperate or
theyd never have tried what they did My opinion is that they hope to
reach San Francisco in a last dash and they were afraid wed come in
ahead of them But I cant understand how that army man aboard would
permit such a thing It is past belief

It was no easy task to make the repairs with the airship in motion
Spare parts including a sprocket chain were carried aboard but the
work had to be done close to the other revolving propeller and as
slowly as it was whirling about it went fast enough to cause instant
death to whoever was hit by it So extreme caution had to be used

To add to the troubles it began to rain violently and a thunderstorm
developed which made matters worse Out in the pelting storm with
electricallycharged clouds all about them and vivid streaks of
lightning hissing near them the aviators worked

They were drenched to the skin Their hands were bruised and cut by
slipping wrenches and hammers Their faces were covered with black
grease dirt and oil But still they labored on The storm grew
worse and it was all the Abaris could do to stagger ahead handicapped
as she was by half power

But there were valiant hearts aboard her and everyone was imbued with
indomitable courage

Were going to do it Dick cried fiercely and the others echoed his
words

Finally after many hours of work the last rivet was driven home and
Mr Vardon cried

There we are Now then full speed ahead

The repaired propeller was thrown into gear It meshed perfectly and
once more the Abaris shot ahead under her full power

Speed her up cried Dick and the motor was put to the limit But
much precious time had been lost Could they win under such adverse
circumstances It was a question each one asked himself

Darkness came on and the tired and weary aviators ate and slept The
night passed a clear calm night for the storm had blown itself out
High over the mountains soared the airship through the hours of
darkness She was fighting to recover what she had lost

And when morning came they calculated they were but a few hundred miles
from San Francisco

Paul who had gone to the pilothouse to relieve Innis gave a startled
cry

Look Look he shouted Theres the other airship

And as the others looked they saw ahead of them emerging from the
midst of a cloud Uncle Ezras speedy craft And as they looked they
saw something elsesomething that filled them with horror

For as they gazed at the craft which had so nearly either by accident
or design wrecked them they saw one of the big side planes crumple
up as does a birds broken wing Either the supports had given way
or a sudden gust of air strained it too much

Theyre falling cried Dick hoarsely

The other airship was The broken plane gave no support on that side
and as the motor still raced on whirling the big propellers the
Larabee unevenly balanced in spite of the mercury stabilizers tilted
to one side

Then a hopeless wreck she turned over and plunged downward toward the
earth Her race was over



CHAPTER XXXII

SAVING UNCLE EZRA

For a moment those aboard Dicks airship uttered not a sound Then as
they saw the rival craft sifting slowly downward gliding from side to
side like a sheet of paper they looked at one another with horror in
their eyes It seemed such a terrible end

Dick was the first to speak

Well have to go down and help them he said simply Some of them
may bealive

It meant stopping the race it meant making the last of the two
landings allowed them And it was a landing in a wild and desolate
place seemingly for there was no sign of city or town below them And
just now after her repairs when everything was running smoothly it
behooved Dick and his associates to take advantage of every mile and
minute they could gain Otherwise some other craft might get in ahead
of them

Yet Dick had said they must go down There was no other course left
them in the name of humanity As the young millionaire had observed
some of those in the wrecked airship might be alive They might
survive the fall great as it was

Send her down Mr Vardon said Dick quietly We may be able to
save some of them

If he thought that possibly he was losing his last chance to win the
transcontinental race he said nothing about it

The motor was shut off and there was silence aboard the Abaris No one
felt like talking As they volplaned downward they saw the wreck of
the Larabee strike the outer branches of a big tree and then turn over
again before crashing to the ground

She may catch fire from the gasolene said Dick in a tense voice
We ought to hurry all we can

I could go down faster said Mr Vardon by starting up the motor
But I dont like to until I see what sort of landing ground well have

No its wiser to go a bit slowly agreed Lieutenant McBride We
must save ourselves in order to save themif possible Its a
terrible accident

As they came nearer earth they saw a comparatively smooth and level
spot amid a clearing of trees It was not far from where the wreck
lay a crumpledup mass Down floated the Abaris gently and hardly
had she ceased rolling along on her wheels that Dick and the others
rushed out to lend their aid to Uncle Ezra and the others

Dicks uncle lay at some little distance from the broken craft

Hes alive said his nephew feeling of the old mans heart Hes
still breathing

Lieutenant Wilson as the name of the army officer on the Larabee was
learned later to be seemed quite badly injured He was tangled up in
the wreckage and it took some work to extricate him Larson was the
most severely hurt He was tenderly placed to one side Fortunately
the wreck had not caught fire

Lets see if we can revive them suggested Lieutenant McBride
nodding toward Uncle Ezra and his fellow soldiers Then we will
consider what is best to do

Simple restoratives were carried aboard Dicks airship and these were
given to Uncle Ezra who revived first He opened his eyes and sat up

Wherewhere am I he stammered Did I win the race

No Uncle Ezra Im sorry to say you didnt answered Dick gently
There was an accident and your airship is smashed

The old man slowly looked over to the crumpled mass of planes and
machinery and then slowly and painfully for he was much bruised he
pulled a notebook from his pocket Leafing over the pages he
announced

Busted to smithereens and she cost me exactly eleven thousand five
hundred and thirtythree dollars and nineteen cents Oh what a lot of
money And the expression on his face was so painful that Dick felt
inclined to laugh solemn as the occasion was But he restrained
himself

Wheres that fellow Larson asked Uncle Ezra

Badly hurt said Dick quietly

Oh well then I wont say anything murmured the old man Oh what
a trip it was

Are you much hurt asked Dick

It did not appear that his uncle was The fall had been a lucky one
for him His helmet had protected his head and he had on two suits of
clothes well padded The others were dressed likewise but it had not
saved Larson

Lieutenant Wilsons most serious injury was a broken leg but he was
also otherwise hurt He soon recovered consciousness and said

Please dont misjudge me I could not stop Larson from trying to ram
you He was insane I guess We have had a terrible time with him
He was mad to try to win this race We remonstrated with him when he
sailed toward you but he said he was only trying to show you what a
superior machine he had and how much better his mercury stabilizers
worked than your gyroscope But I really fear he meant you some
injury

I think so too said Lieutenant McBride and I am glad to learn no
one else was in the plot

And his own foolish actions were the cause of this wreck went on
Lieutenant Wilson He said he was sure of winning after he had left
you behind and he wanted to try some experiments in quick turns He
made one too quick and broke off one of the planes

Well we must consider what is to be done said Mr Vardon We must
get you all to a hospital and a doctor at once

Dont mind about me replied Lieutenant Wilson gamely If you can
send me help do so but dont delay here Go on and win the race
You have the best chance I believe

We dont go on until we see you cared for spoke Dick We would
take you all with us only it might endanger you

Well I wish youd take me exclaimed Uncle Ezra limping about I
want to get back home Nephew Richard Im sorry I tried to beat you
in this race

Thats all right Uncle Ezra answered the young millionaire You
had as good a right to try for the prize as I did

But I want to say I didnt have no hand in trying to butt into you
went on Mr Larabee It was all thatthat unfortunate mans idea
he added more softly as he gazed at Larson who was still unconscious
Dick will you forgive me and shake hands

Surely Uncle Ezra and as their hands met Grit who had been eyeing
Mr Larabee narrowly uttered a joyful bark and actually wagged his
tail at Uncle Ezra

Grit you shake hands too ordered Dick and though Uncle Ezra was a
little diffident at first he grasped the extended paw of the bulldog
They were friends for the first time

We could take Uncle Ezra in the airship said Paul after a pause
and if we could only send out a call for help for Lieutenant Wilson
and Larson they would be looked after

Theres an army post not far from here spoke Wilson If you could
make a trip there

Wed have to land again to summon aid and this is the last stop we
are allowed in the race said Mr Vardon I dont see how

Your wireless interrupted Lieutenant McBride We can send out a
call to the army post by thatif they have a wireless station

They have answered Lieutenant Wilson as his fellow officer looked
at him If you will summon aid from there we will be well taken care
of

Good cried Dick That problem is solved

The wireless apparatus was brought out the small balloon inflated and
it carried aloft the aerials Then while the call for aid was being
sent out Lieutenants Wilson and Larson were made as comfortable as
possible and some of Uncle Ezras scratches and bruises were looked
after

No more airships for me he said bitterly though with a chastened
spirit Im going to stick to farming and my woolen mill Just
think of itover eleven thousand dollars in that pile ofjunk and
he shook his head sadly at the wreck of his airship

Well take you on to San Francisco with us if you like said Dick
You can see us win the raceif we can he added

You still have an excellent chance said Lieutenant McBride My
advice to you would be to remain here a few days to rest up and make
sure all your machinery is in good order The time will not count
against you By that time the injured ones will be cared for Then
you can go on again and complete the course You have enough oil and
gasolene have you not

We could ask that some be brought from the army post if we have not
Dick answered I think we will adopt that plan

And II hope you win said Uncle Ezra Id like to see that twenty
thousand dollars come into the family anyhow he added with a
mountainous sigh



CHAPTER XXXIII

WITH UNCLE EZRAS HELP

Were off

On the last lap

No more landings

Thus cried Innis Paul and Larry as they stood in the cabin of the
airship Once more they were on the flight

This train makes no stops this side of San Francisco cried Dick
Hamilton after the manner of the conductor of a Limited That is I
hope we dont he added with a grim smile If we do it will cost me
twenty thousand dollars

Quite an expensive stop observed Lieutenant McBride

Dont think of it said Uncle Ezra Nephew Richard after my
failure youve just GOT to win that prize

Ill try Dick answered

It was several days after the events narrated in the last chapter The
wireless sending out its crackling call had brought speedy help from
the army post and the two lieutenants were taken to the hospital by
their fellow soldiers

Larson recovered consciousness before Dick and his friends left but
was delirious and practically insane They had to bind him with ropes
to prevent him doing himself and others an injury His mind had been
affected for some time it was believed

Some time later I am glad to say he recovered in a sanitorium
though he was always lame from the accident He was a much different
man however and begged Dicks forgiveness for trying to collide with
him Lieutenant Wilson made a quick recovery and in spite of the
mishap still kept up his interest in aviation winning much fame for
himself

The army officers who came to attend the injured ones brought Dick
some supplies and gasolene

Uncle Ezra begged that some part of his wrecked airship be saved but
it was impossible There was little left that was worth anything and
Dick by taking his uncle as an extra passenger added enough weight as
it was so that no parts of the Larabee could be taken along

I might have saved a little said Uncle Ezra with a sigh Ive
lost a pile of money But he realized that it was out of the question

The Abaris had been gone over minutely and put in excellent shape for
her final dash She was taken to the edge of a sloping tableland and
there once more launched into space Before that however Lieutenant
Wilson had been taken back to the army post and Larson sent to the
hospital Lieutenant Wilson wished Dick and his friends all sorts of
good luck

Then with Uncle Ezra aboard the start was made There was some
crowding because of the extra passenger and his valise which he
insisted on bringing with him but this could be borne

We ought to make San Francisco in three hours now said Dick when
they were up in the air once more

Uncle Ezra was frankly delighted with his nephews craft He did not
even say it was wasteful when Dick told him how much she cost

I know airships are terrible expensiveterrible said Mr Larabee
as he looked at the notebook in which he had jotted down every item of
money paid for his own

That Larson had wasted money and used much of what was given him for
his own purposes was very evident But it was too late to think of
that now

Uncle Ezra told of their experiences in crossing the continent They
had really had excellent luck and in the hands of a better aviator or
one more dependable the Larabee might have won the race She was
really a good biplane but could only carry three and then with no
comfort at all as compared to Dicks But the mercury stabilizers
worked fairly well though not as good as the gyroscope

Yes I was sorry more than once that I ever left Dankville Uncle
Ezra said but Larson wouldnt let me stop He kept right on Im
sure he was crazy

On and on rushed the Abaris She was racing against time now and
every minute and mile counted While down on the ground helping save
Uncle Ezra Dick had by wireless communicated with the army
authorities in San Francisco telling them he was coming on the last
stage and asking that a landingplace be designated This was done
Presido Park Reservation on the outskirts of the city being named as
the spot where the craft could officially come down

Well soon be there remarked Dick who was at the wheel It was
afternoon and by computation they were not more than ninety miles from
their goal

See anything of any other craft asked Paul of his chum

Take a look Innis suggested the young millionaire We might get a
race at the last minute

Innis swept the horizon with the glasses

Theres something coming behind us he said I cant tell whether
its a big bird or an airship

A little later however the speck in the blue sky was made out to be a
big biplane rushing onward

Theyre probably trying for the prize said Dick Of course we
dont know anything about their time and stops but just the same Im
going to beat her in if I can Well run the motor under forced
speed Mr Vardon and feed her heated gasolene

Thats the idea cried the aviator That ought to help some

The motor was so adjusted as to take heated gasolene the liquid
vaporizing and exploding better than when cold The Abaris rushed on
at increased speed

But so also came on behind her the other airship As Dick had said
that craft might have no chance having used up more than her limit of
stops or having consumed more elapsed time than had he But for all
that he was taking no chances

The other craft was a swift one That was easily seen as it slowly
crept up on Dick The speed of each was terrific The gages showed
ninetyfive miles an hour for the Abaris At that rate the city of
Oakland just across the bay from San Francisco was soon sighted

And then something happened that nearly put Dick out of the race His
motor suddenly stopped and all efforts to start it proved futile

Weve got to go down cried our hero and within sight of the goal
too This is fierce

Whats the trouble asked Larry

Not a drop of gasolene left said Mr Vardon with a tragic gesture
as he made an examination Theres a leak in the tank We havent a
drop left The vibration must have opened a seam and weve been
spilling our fuel as we went along

There goes the other airship cried Innis as the big biplane flashed
by them They had now crossed Oakland and the bay

And the Presido Park is in sight yelled Paul pointing to a big
field now black with people for the coming of Dick had been flashed
all over San Francisco and Oakland

We can never make it the young millionaire murmured Well have to
volplane down but we cant reach the park Oh for a gallon of
gasolene One gallon would do

Whats that cried Uncle Ezra coming from his bunk room What do
you want of gasolene

To complete the trip cried Dick Ours is all gone A gallon would
do

Then by hickory you shall have it suddenly cried Mr Larabee

Where can you get it demanded Dick There isnt a drop aboard

Oh yes there is his uncle answered Here it is and he brought
from his room a square gallon can

Great Scott cried Dick as he took it and hurried with it toward the
empty tank Where in the world did you get it

I brought it along in my valise to clean the grease spots off my
clothes answered Uncle Ezra simply I got all oil from my airship
But I wasnt going to buy a new suit when I could clean my old one

Whoop cried Dick with boyish enthusiasm This may save the race
for us

The Abaris had already begun to settle down but a moment later as the
motor received the supply of gasolene so Providentially provided she
shot forward again her momentum scarcely checked

On and on she rushed It was nip and tuck now between her and the
rival airship The big crowd in the aviation field yelled and shouted
at the sight of the thrilling race

The other airship seemed to falter and hesitate The pilot cut off his
motor but too soon Dick rushed his craft on passed the other and
then seeing that he had the advantage he turned off his power and
volplaned to the landing spot just about fifteen seconds in advance of
his rival He had beaten in the race at the last minute But it still
remained to be seen whether he had triumphed over other and possibly
previous arrivals

Out of the Abaris rushed the young millionaire and his friends before
she had ceased rolling over the ground The other biplane was just
behind them

An army officer ran out of the crowd of spectators

Who is the pilot of this craft he asked

I am answered Dick

And where is your official army timekeeper

Here answered Lieutenant McBride saluting Are we the first to
cross the continent

How anxiously Dick waited for the answer No not the first replied
the San Francisco officer One biplane arrived yesterday What is
your time

Lieutenant McBride made a hasty calculation

Sixtytwo hours forty minutes and fourteen seconds from New York
taking out the time of two landings was the reply

Then you win cried Captain Weston as he introduced himself That
is unless this other craft can better your time For the first
arrival was seventytwo hours altogether

And Dick had won for the biplane with which he had just had the
exciting race had consumed more than eighty hours exclusive of stops
from coast to coast

Hurray Dick You win cried Innis clapping his chum on the back

The best transcontinental flight ever made declared Captain Weston
as he congratulated the young millionaire

Id like to have gotten here first murmured Dick

Well youd have been here first only for the delay my airship caused
you said Uncle Ezra Im sorry

But you get the prize spoke Lieutenant McBride

Yes assented Captain Weston of Fort Mason It was the time that
counted not the order of arrival Which reminds me that you may yet
be beaten Mr Hamilton for there are other airships on the way

But Dick was not beaten His nearest competitor made a poorer record
by several hours so Dicks performance stood

And that really is all there is to tell of this story except to add
that by the confession of Larson later it was learned that he had
tampered with Mr Vardons gyroscope as had been suspected The twenty
thousand dollars was duly paid and Dick gave the United States
government an option to purchase his patents of the Abaris For them he
would receive a substantial sum and a large part of this would go to
Mr Vardon for his gyroscope

So youll be all right from now on his cousin Innis remarked

Yes thanks to your friend Dick Hamilton My good luck all dates from
meeting him

Yes he is a lucky chap agreed Paul

I think Uncle Ezra had all the luck this trip put in Dick as he
heard the last words That gasolene he brought along to clean the
grease off his clothes saved our bacon all right It sure did

And I believe Dick was right

Mr Hamilton to whom Dick wired a brief message of the successful
ending of the trip telegraphed back


Congratulations You made good after all I havent any doubts now


Thats another time I put one over on dad laughed Dick

Where are you going Larry asked the young millionaire as he saw
his young newspaper friend hurrying across the aviation field

Im going to wire the story to the Leader was the answer I want
em to know we crossed the continent and won the prize Itll be a
great beat

Of how Dick was feted and greeted by an aviation club in San Francisco
of how he was made much of by the army officers and how he had to give
many exhibition flights I will say nothing here as this book is
already lengthy enough Sufficient to remark that the young
millionaire had a great time at the City of the Golden Gate and Uncle
Ezra and his friends enjoyed it with him Grit also came in for a
share of attention

Dick Hamilton left his airship with the San Francisco army officers as
he had agreed to do for they wanted to study its construction In due
season the party started back East

I rather calculated youd go back in the airship said Uncle Ezra
Railroad fare is terrible expensive and Ive lost so much money
already

Ill buy your ticket said Dick generously especially as you helped
me win the race and Mr Larabee with a look of relief on his face
put back his pocketbook

And now for Hamilton Corners exclaimed Dick as they got in the
train Ive had enough of airships for a while though it was great
sport And here we will take leave of Dick Hamilton and his friends
