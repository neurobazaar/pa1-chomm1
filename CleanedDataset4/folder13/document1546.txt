Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

SONNETS TO SUNDRY NOTES OF MUSIC

by William Shakespeare




I

It was a lordings daughter the fairest one of three
That liked of her master as well as well might be
Till looking on an Englishman the fairst that eye could see
 Her fancy fell aturning
Long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight
To leave the master loveless or kill the gallant knight
To put in practice either alas it was a spite
 Unto the silly damsel
But one must be refused more mickle was the pain
That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain
For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain
 Alas she could not help it
Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day
Which by a gift of learnlng did bear the maid away
Then lullaby the learned man hath got the lady gay
 For now my song is ended


II

On a day alack the day
Love whose month was ever May
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air
Through the velvet leaves the wind
All unseen gan passage find
That the lover sick to death
Wishd himself the heavens breath
Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
Air would I might triumph so
But alas my hand hath sworn
Neer to pluck thee from thy thorn
Vow alack for youth unmeet
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet
Thou for whom Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were
And deny himself for Jove
Turning mortal for thy love


III

My flocks feed not
My ewes breed not
My rams speed not
 All is amiss
Love is dying
Faiths defying
Hearts denying
 Causer of this
All my merry jigs are quite forgot
All my ladys love is lost God wot
Where her faith was firmly fixd in love
There a nay is placd without remove
One silly cross
Wrought all my loss
 O frowning Fortune cursed fickle dame
For now I see
Inconstancy
 More in women than in men remain

In black mourn I
All fears scorn I
Love bath forlorn me
 Living in thrall
Heart is bleeding
All help needing
O cruel speeding
 Fraughted with gall
My shepherds pipe can sound no deal
My wethers bell rings doleful knell
My curtail dog that wont to have playd
Plays not at all but seems afraid
With sighs so deep
Procures to weep
 In howlingwise to see my doleful plight
How sighs resound
Through heartless ground
 Like a thousand vanquishd men in bloody fight

Clear wells spring not
Sweet birds sing not
Green plants bring not
 Forth they die
Herds stand weeping
Flocks all sleeping
Nymphs back peeping
 Fearfully
All our pleasure known to us poor swains
All our merry meetings on the plains
All our evening sport from us is fled
All our love is lost for Love is dead
Farewell sweet lass
Thy like neer was
 For a sweet content the cause of all my moan
Poor Coridon
Must live alone
Other help for him I see that there is none


IV

When as thine eye hath chose the dame
And stalld the deer that thou shouldst strike
Let reason rule things worthy blame
As well as fancy partial might
 Take counsel of some wiser head
 Neither too young nor yet unwed

And when thou comst thy tale to tell
Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk
Lest she some subtle practice smell
A cripple soon can find a halt
 But plainly say thou lovst her well
 And set thy person forth to sell

What though her frowning brows be bent
Her cloudy looks will calm ere night
And then too late she will repent
That thus dissembled her delight
 And twice desire ere it be day
 That which with scorn she put away

What though she strive to try her strength
And ban and brawl and say thee nay
Her feeble force will yield at length
When craft hath taught her thus to say
 Had women been so strong as men
 In faith you had not had it then

And to her will frame all thy ways
Spare not to spendand chiefly there
Where thy desert may merit praise
By ringing in thy ladys ear
 The strongest castle tower and town
 The golden bullet beats it down

Serve always with assured trust
And in thy suit be humble true
Unless thy lady prove unjust
Press never thou to choose anew
 When time shall serve be thou not slack
 To proffer though she put thee back

The wiles and guiles that women work
Dissembled with an outward show
The tricks and toys that in them lurk
The cock that treads them shall not know
 Have you not heard it said full oft
 A womans nay doth stand for naught

Think women still to strive with men
To sin and never for to saint
There is no heaven by holy then
When time with age doth them attaint
 Were kisses all the joys in bed
 One woman would another wed

But soft enoughtoo much I fear
Lest that my mistress hear my song
Shell not stick to round me i the ear
To teach my tongue to be so long
 Yet will she blush here be it said
 To hear her secrets so bewrayd


V

Live with me and be my love
And we will all the pleasures prove
That hills and valleys dales and fields
And all the craggy mountains yields

There will we sit upon the rocks
And see the shepherds feed their flocks
By shallow rivers by whose falls
Melodious birds sing madrigals

There will I make thee a bed of roses
With a thousand fragrant posies
A cap of flowers and a kirtle
Embroiderd all with leaves of myrtle

A belt of straw and ivy buds
With coral clasps and amber studs
And if these pleasures may thee move
Then live with me and be my love

 LOVES ANSWER

If that the world and love were young
And truth in every shepherds tongue
These pretty pleasures might me move
To live with thee and be thy love


VI

As it fell upon a day
In the merry month of May
Sitting in a pleasant shade
Which a grove of myrtles made
Beasts did leap and birds did sing
Trees did grow and plants did spring
Everything did banish moan
Save the nightingale alone
She poor bird as all forlorn
Leand her breast uptill a thorn
And there sung the dolefullst ditty
That to hear it was great pity
Fie fie fie now would she cry
Teru teru by and by
That to hear her so complain
Scarce I could from tears refrain
For her griefs so lively shown
Made me think upon mine own
Ah thought I thou mournst in vain
None take pity on thy pain
Senseless trees they cannot hear thee
Ruthless bears they will not cheer thee
King Pandion he is dead
All thy friends are lappd in lead
All thy fellowbirds do sing
Careless of thy sorrowing
Even so poor bird like thee
None alive will pity me
Whilst as fickle fortune smild
Thou and I were both beguild
Every one that flatters thee
Is no friend in misery
Words are easy like the wind
Faithful friends are hard to find
Every man will be thy friend
Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend
But if store of crowns be scant
No man will supply thy want
If that one be prodigal
Bountiful they will him call
And with suchlike flattering
Pity but he were a king
If he be addict to vice
Quickly him they will entice
If to women he be bent
They have at commandement
But if fortune once do frown
Then farewell his great renown
They that fawnd on him before
Use his company no more
He that is thy frend indeed
He will help thee in thy need
If thou sorrow he will weep
If thou wake he cannot sleep
Thus of every grief in heart
He with thee doth bear a part
These are certain signs to know
Faithful friend from flattering foe
