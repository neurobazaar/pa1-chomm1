THANKFUL BLOSSOM

I

The time was the year of grace 1779 the locality Morristown New
Jersey

It was bitterly cold A northeasterly wind had been stiffening the mud
of the mornings thaw into a rigid record of that days wayfaring on
the Baskingridge road The hoofprints of cavalry the deep ruts left
by baggagewagons and the deeper channels worn by artillery lay stark
and cold in the waning light of an April day There were icicles on
the fences a rime of silver on the windward bark of maples and
occasional bare spots on the rocky protuberances of the road as if
Nature had worn herself out at the knees and elbows through long
waiting for the tardy spring A few leaves disinterred by the thaw
became crisp again and rustled in the wind making the summer a thing
so remote that all human hope and conjecture fled before them

Here and there the wayside fences and walls were broken down or
dismantled and beyond them fields of snow downtrodden and discolored
and strewn with fragments of leather camp equipage harness and
castoff clothing showed traces of the recent encampment and
congregation of men On some there were still standing the ruins of
rudely constructed cabins or the semblance of fortification equally
rude and incomplete A fox stealing along a halffilled ditch a wolf
slinking behind an earthwork typified the human abandonment and
desolation

One by one the faint sunset tints faded from the sky the faroff
crests of the Orange hills grew darker the nearer files of pines on
the Whatnong Mountain became a mere black background and with the
comingon of night came too an icy silence that seemed to stiffen and
arrest the very wind itself The crisp leaves no longer rustled the
waving whips of alder and willow snapped no longer the icicles no
longer dropped a cold fruitage from barren branch and spray and the
roadside trees relapsed into stony quiet so that the sound of horses
hoofs breaking through the thin dull lustreless films of ice that
patched the furrowed road might have been heard by the nearest
Continental picket a mile away

Either a knowledge of this or the difficulties of the road evidently
irritated the viewless horseman Long before he became visible his
voice was heard in halfsuppressed objurgation of the road of his
beast of the country folk and the country generally Steady you
jade Jump you devil jump Curse the road and the beggarly
farmers that durst not mend it And then the moving bulk of horse and
rider suddenly arose above the hill floundered and splashed and then
as suddenly disappeared and the rattling hoofbeats ceased

The stranger had turned into a deserted lane still cushioned with
untrodden snow A stone wall on one handin better keeping and
condition than the boundary monuments of the outlying fieldsbespoke
protection and exclusiveness Halfway up the lane the rider checked
his speed and dismounting tied his horse to a wayside sapling This
done he went cautiously forward toward the end of the lane and a
farmhouse from whose gable window a light twinkled through the
deepening night Suddenly he stopped hesitated and uttered an
impatient ejaculation The light had disappeared He turned sharply
on his heel and retraced his steps until opposite a farmshed that
stood a few paces from the wall Hard by a large elm cast the gaunt
shadow of its leafless limbs on the wall and surrounding snow The
stranger stepped into this shadow and at once seemed to become a part
of its trembling intricacies

At the present moment it was certainly a bleak place for a tryst There
was snow yet clinging to the trunk of the tree and a film of ice on
its bark the adjacent wall was slippery with frost and fringed with
icicles Yet in all there was a ludicrous suggestion of some sentiment
past and unseasonable several dislodged stones of the wall were so
disposed as to form a bench and seats and under the elmtrees film of
ice could still be seen carved on its bark the effigy of a heart
divers initials and the legend Thine Forever

The stranger however kept his eyes fixed only on the farmshed and
the open field beside it Five minutes passed in fruitless expectancy
Ten minutes And then the rising moon slowly lifted herself over the
black range of the Orange hills and looked at him blushing a little
as if the appointment were her own

The face and figure thus illuminated were those of a strongly built
handsome man of thirty so soldierly in bearing that it needed not the
buff epaulets and facings to show his captains rank in the Continental
army Yet there was something in his facial expression that
contradicted the manliness of his presencean irritation and
querulousness that were inconsistent with his size and strength This
fretfulness increased as the moments went by without sign or motion in
the faintly lit field beyond until in peevish exasperation he began
to kick the nearer stones against the wall

Moooow

The soldier started Not that he was frightened nor that he had
failed to recognize in these prolonged syllables the deepchested
halfdrowsy low of a cow but that it was so near himevidently just
beside the wall If an object so bulky could have approached him so
near without his knowledge might not she

Moooo

He drew nearer the wall cautiously So Cushy Mooly Come up
Bossy he said persuasively Moobut here the low unexpectedly
broke down and ended in a very human and rather musical little laugh

Thankful exclaimed the soldier echoing the laugh a trifle uneasily
and affectedly as a hooded little head arose above the wall

Well replied the figure supporting a prettily rounded chin on her
hands as she laid her elbows complacently on the wallwell what
did you expect Did you want me to stand here all night while you
skulked moonstruck under a tree Or did you look for me to call you by
name did you expect me to shout out Capt Allan Brewster

Thankful hush

Capt Allan Brewster of the Connecticut Contingent continued the
girl with an affected raising of a low pathetic voice that was
however inaudible beyond the tree Capt Brewster behold meyour
obleeged and humble servant and sweetheart to command

Capt Brewster succeeded after a slight skirmish at the wall in
possessing himself of the girls hand at which although still
struggling she relented slightly

It isnt every lad that Id low for she said with an affected pout
and there may be others that would not take it amiss though there be
fine ladies enough at the assembly halls at Morristown as might think
it hoydenish

Nonsense love said the captain who had by this time mounted the
wall and encircled the girls waist with his arm Nonsense you
startled me only But he added suddenly taking her round chin in
his hand and turning her face toward the moon with an uneasy
halfsuspicion why did you take that light from the window What has
happened

We had unexpected guests sweetheart said Thankful the count just
arrived

That infernal Hessian He stopped and gazed questioningly into her
face The moon looked upon her at the same time the face was as
sweet as placid as truthful as her own Possibly these two
inconstants understood each other

Nay Allan he is not a Hessian but an exiled gentleman from
abroada nobleman

There are no noblemen now sniffed the trooper contemptuously
Congress has so decreed it All men are born free and equal

But they are not Allan said Thankful with a pretty trouble in her
brows even cows are not born equal Is yon calf that was dropped
last night by Brindle the equal of my red heifer whose mother come by
herself in a ship from Surrey Do they look equal

Titles are but breath said Capt Brewster doggedly There was an
ominous pause

Nay there is one nobleman left said Thankful and he is my
ownmy natures nobleman

Capt Brewster did not reply From certain arch gestures and wreathed
smiles with which this forward young woman accompanied her statement
it would seem to be implied that the gentleman who stood before her was
the nobleman alluded to At least he so accepted it and embraced her
closely her arms and part of her mantle clinging around his neck In
this attitude they remained quiet for some moments slightly rocking
from side to side like a metronome a movement I fancy peculiarly
bucolic pastoral and idyllic and as such I wot observed by
Theocritus and Virgil

At these supreme moments weak woman usually keeps her wits about her
much better than your superior reasoning masculine animal and while
the gallant captain was losing himself upon her perfect lips Miss
Thankful distinctly heard the farmgate click and otherwise noticed
that the moon was getting high and obtrusive She half released
herself from the captains arms thoughtfully and tenderlybut firmly
Tell me all about yourself Allan dear she said quietly making room
for him on the wallall everything

She turned upon him her beautiful eyeseyes habitually earnest and
even grave in expression yet holding in their brave brown depths a
sweet childlike reliance and dependency eyes with a certain tender
deprecating droop in the brownfringed lids and yet eyes that seemed
to say to every man who looked upon them I am truthful be frank with
me Indeed I am convinced there is not one of my impressible sex
who looking in those pleading eyes would not have perjured himself on
the spot rather than have disappointed their fair owner

Capt Brewsters mouth resumed its old expression of discontent

Everything is growing worse Thankful and the cause is lost Congress
does nothing and Washington is not the man for the crisis Instead of
marching to Philadelphia and forcing that wretched rabble of Hancock
and Adams at the point of the bayonet he writes letters

A dignified formal old fool interrupted Mistress Thankful
indignantly and look at his wife Didnt Mistress Ford and Mistress
Baily ay and the best blood of Morris County go down to his
Excellencys in their finest bibs and tuckers and didnt they find my
lady in a pinafore doing chores Vastly polite treatment indeed As
if the whole world didnt know that the general was taken by surprise
when my lady came riding up from Virginia with all those fine
cavaliers just to see what his Excellency was doing at these assembly
balls And fine doings I dare say

This is but idle gossip Thankful said Capt Brewster with the
faintest appearance of selfconsciousness the assembly balls are
conceived by the general to strengthen the confidence of the townsfolk
and mitigate the rigors of the winter encampment I go there myself
rarely I have but little taste for junketing and gavotting with my
country in such need No Thankful What we want is a leader and the
men of Connecticut feel it keenly If I have been spoken of in that
regard added the captain with a slight inflation of his manly breast
it is because they know of my sacrificesbecause as New England
yeomen they know my devotion to the cause They know of my suffering

The bright face that looked into his was suddenly afire with womanly
sympathy the pretty brow was knit the sweet eyes overflowed with
tenderness Forgive me Allan I forgotperhaps loveperhaps
dearest you are hungry now

No not now replied Captain Brewster with gloomy stoicism yet
he added it is nearly a week since I have tasted meat

IIbrought a few things with me continued the girl with a
certain hesitating timidity She reached down and produced a basket
from the shadow of the wall These chickensshe held up a pair of
pulletsthe commanderinchief himself could not buy I kept them for
MY commander And this pot of marmalade which I know my Allan loves
is the same I put up last summer I thought very tenderly you might
like a piece of that bacon you liked so once dear Ah sweetheart
shall we ever sit down to our little board Shall we ever see the end
of this awful war Dont you think dear very pleadingly it would
be best to give it up King George is not such a very bad man is he
Ive thought sweetheart very confidently that mayhap you and he
might make it all up without the aid of those Washingtons who do
nothing but starve one to death And if the king only knew you
Allanshould see you as I do sweethearthed do just as you say

During this speech she handed him the several articles alluded to and
he received them storing them away in such receptacles of his clothing
as were convenientwith this notable difference that with HER the act
was graceful and picturesque with him there was a ludicrousness of
suggestion that his broad shoulders and uniform only heightened

I think not of myself lass he said putting the eggs in his pocket
and buttoning the chickens within his martial breast I think not of
myself and perhaps I often spare that counsel which is but little
heeded But I have a duty to my mento Connecticut He here tied the
marmalade up in his handkerchief I confess I have sometimes thought
I might under provocation be driven to extreme measures for the good
of the cause I make no pretence to leadership but

With you at the head of the army broke in Thankful enthusiastically
peace would be declared within a fortnight

There is no flattery however outrageous that a man will not accept
from the woman whom he believes loves him He will perhaps doubt its
influence in the colder judgment of mankind but he will consider that
this poor creature at least understands him and in some vague way
represents the eternal but unrecognized verities And when this is
voiced by lips that are young and warm and red it is somehow quite as
convincing as the bloodless remoter utterance of posterity

Wherefore the trooper complacently buttoned the compliment over his
chest with the pullets

I think you must go now Allan she said looking at him with that
pseudomaternal air which the youngest of women sometimes assume to
their lovers as if the doll had suddenly changed sex and grown to
mans estate You must go now dear for it may so chance that father
is considering my absence overmuch You will come again a Wednesday
sweetheart and you will not go to the assemblies nor visit Mistress
Judith nor take any girl pickaback again on your black horse and
you will let me know when you are hungry

She turned her brown eyes lovingly yet with a certain pretty trouble
in the brow and such a searching pleading inquiry in her glance that
the captain kissed her at once Then came the final embrace performed
by the captain in a halfperfunctory quiet manner with a due regard
for the friable nature of part of his provisions Satisfying himself
of the integrity of the eggs by feeling for them in his pocket he
waved a military salute with the other hand to Miss Thankful and was
gone A few minutes later the sound of his horses hoofs rang sharply
from the icy hillside

But as he reached the summit two horsemen wheeled suddenly from the
shadow of the roadside and bade him halt

Capt Brewster if this moon does not deceive me queried the
foremost stranger with grave civility

The same Major Van Zandt I calculate returned Brewster
querulously

Your calculation is quite right I regret Capt Brewster that it is
my duty to inform you that you are under arrest

By whose orders

The commanderinchiefs

For what

Mutinous conduct and disrespect of your superior officers

The sword that Capt Brewster had drawn at the sudden appearance of the
strangers quivered for a moment in his strong hand Then sharply
striking it across the pommel of his saddle he snapped it in twain
and cast the pieces at the feet of the speaker

Go on he said doggedly

Capt Brewster said Major Van Zandt with infinite gravity it is
not for me to point out the danger to you of this outspoken emotion
except practically in its effect upon the rations you have in your
pocket If I mistake not they have suffered equally with your steel
Forward march

Capt Brewster looked down and then dropped to the rear as the
discased yolks of Mistress Thankfuls most precious gift slid slowly
and pensively over his horses flanks to the ground



II

Mistress Thankful remained at the wall until her lover had disappeared
Then she turned a mere lissom shadow in that uncertain light and
glided under the eaves of the shed and thence from tree to tree of the
orchard lingering a moment under each as a trout lingers in the shadow
of the bank in passing a shallow and so reached the farmhouse and the
kitchen door where she entered Thence by a back staircase she slipped
to her own bower from whose window half an hour before she had taken
the signalling light This she lit again and placed upon a chest of
drawers and taking off her hood and a shapeless sleeveless mantle she
had worn went to the mirror and proceeded to readjust a high horn
comb that had been somewhat displaced by the captains arm and
otherwise after the fashion of her sex to remove all traces of a
previous lover It may be here observed that a man is very apt to come
from the smallest encounter with his dulcinea distrait bored or
shamefaced to forget that his cravat is awry or that a long blond
hair is adhering to his button But as to Mademoisellewell looking
at Miss Pussys sleek paws and spotless face would you ever know that
she had been at the creamjug

Thankful was I think satisfied with her appearance Small doubt but
she had reason for it And yet her gown was a mere slip of flowered
chintz gathered at the neck and falling at an angle of fifteen
degrees to within an inch of a short petticoat of gray flannel But so
surely is the complete mould of symmetry indicated in the poise or line
of any single member that looking at the erect carriage of her
graceful brown head or below to the curves that were lost in her
shapely ankles or the little feet that hid themselves in the
broadbuckled shoes you knew that the rest was as genuine and
beautiful

Mistress Thankful after a pause opened the door and listened Then
she softly slipped down the back staircase to the front hall It was
dark but the door of the companyroom or parlor was faintly
indicated by the light that streamed beneath it She stood still for a
moment hesitatingly when suddenly a hand grasped her own and half
led half dragged her into the sittingroom opposite It was dark
There was a momentary fumbling for the tinderbox and flint a muttered
oath over one or two impeding articles of furniture and Thankful
laughed And then the light was lit and her father a gray wrinkled
man of sixty still holding her hand stood before her

You have been out mistress

I have said Thankful

And not alone growled the old man angrily

No said Mistress Thankful with a smile that began in the corners of
her brown eyes ran down into the dimpled curves of her mouth and
finally ended in the sudden revelation of her white teethno not
alone

With whom asked the old man gradually weakening under her strong
saucy presence

Well father said Thankful taking a seat on a table and swinging
her little feet somewhat ostentatiously toward him I was with Capt
Allan Brewster of the Connecticut Contingent

That man

That man

I forbid you seeing him again

Thankful gripped the table with a hand on each side of her to
emphasize the statement and swinging her feet replied

I shall see him as often as I like father

Thankful Blossom

Abner Blossom

I see you know not said Mr Blossom abandoning the severely
paternal mandatory air for one of confidential disclosure I see you
know not his reputation He is accused of inciting his regiment to
revoltof being a traitor to the cause

And since when Abner Blossom have YOU felt such concern for the
cause Since you refused to sell supplies to the Continental
commissary except at double profits since you told me you were glad I
had not polities like Mistress Ford

Hush said the father motioning to the parlor

Hush echoed Thankful indignantly I wont be hushed Everybody
says Hush to me The count says Hush Allan says Hush You say
Hush Im aweary of this hushing Ah if there was a man who
didnt say it to me and Mistress Thankful lifted her fine eyes to the
ceiling

You are unwise Thankfulfoolish indiscreet That is why you
require much monition

Thankful swung her feet in silence for a few moments then suddenly
leaped from the table and seizing the old man by the lapels of his
coat fixed her eyes upon him and said suspiciously Why did you
keep me from going in the companyroom Why did you bring me in here

Blossom senior was staggered for a moment Because you know the
count

And you were afraid the count should know I had a sweetheart Well
Ill go in and tell him now she said marching toward the door

Then why did you not tell him when you slipped out an hour ago eh
lass queried the old man grasping her hand But tis all one
Thankful twas not for him I stopped you There is a young spark with
himay came even as you left lassa likely young gallant and he
and the count are jabbering away in their own lingo a kind of Italian
belike eh Thankful

I know not she said thoughtfully Which way came the other In
fact a fear that this young stranger might have witnessed the
captains embrace began to creep over her

From town my lass

Thankful turned to her father as if she had been waiting a reply to a
longasked question Well

Were it not well to put on a few furbelows and a tucker queried the
old man Tis a gallant young spark none of your country folk

No said Thankful with the promptness of a woman who was looking her
best and knew it And the old man looking at her accepted her
judgment and without another word led her to the parlor door and
opening it said briefly My daughter Mistress Thankful Blossom

With the opening of the door came the sound of earnest voices that
instantly ceased upon the appearance of Mistress Thankful Two
gentlemen lolling before the fire arose instantly and one came forward
with an air of familiar yet respectful recognition

Nay this is far too great happiness Mistress Thankful he said
with a strongly marked foreign accent and a still more strongly marked
foreign manner I have been in despair and my friend here the Baron
Pomposo likewise

The slightest trace of a smile and the swiftest of reproachful
glances lit up the dark face of the baron as he bowed low in the
introduction Thankful dropped the courtesy of the periodi e a
duck with semicircular sweep of the right foot forward But the right
foot was so pretty and the grace of the little figure so perfect that
the baron raised his eyes from the foot to the face in serious
admiration In the one rapid feminine glance she had given him she
had seen that he was handsome in the second which she could not help
from his protracted silence she saw that his beauty centred in his
girlish half fawnlike dark eyes

The baron explained Mr Blossom rubbing his hands together as if
through mere friction he was trying to impart a warmth to the reception
which his hard face discountenancedthe baron visits us under
discouragement He comes from far countries It is the custom of
gentlefolk ofof foreign extraction to wander through strange lands
commenting upon the habits and doings of the peoples He will find in
Jersey continued Mr Blossom apparently appealing to Thankful yet
really evading her contemptuous glance a hardworking yeomanry ever
ready to welcome the stranger and account to him penny for penny for
all his necessary expenditure for which purpose in these troublous
times he will provide for himself gold or other moneys not affected by
these local disturbances

He will find good friend Blossom said the baron in a rapid voluble
way utterly at variance with the soft quiet gravity of his eyes
Beauty Grace Accomplishment andehSanta Maria what shall I
say He turned appealingly to the count

Virtue nodded the count

Truly Birtoo all in the fair lady of thees countries Ah believe
me honest friend Blossom there is mooch more in thees than in thoss

So much of this speech was addressed to Mistress Thankful that she had
to show at least one dimple in reply albeit her brows were slightly
knit and she had turned upon the speaker her honest questioning eyes

And then the General Washington has been kind enough to offer his
protection added the count

Any foolany one supplemented Thankful hastily with a slight
blushmay have the generals pass ay and his good word But what
of Mistress Prudence Bookstavershe that has a sweetheart in
Knyphausens brigade ayI warrant a Hessian but of gentle blood as
Mistress Prudence has often told meand look you all her letters
stopped by the general ay I warrant read by my Lady Washington too
as if twere HER fault that her lad was in arms against Congress
Riddle me that now

Tis but prudence lass said Blossom frowning on the girl Tis
that she might disclose some movement of the army tending to defeat
the enemy

And why should she not try to save her lad from capture or ambuscade
such as befell the Hessian commissary with the provisions that you

Mr Blossom in an ostensible fatherly embrace managed to pinch
Mistress Thankful sharply Hush lass he said with simulated
playfulness your tongue clacks like the Whippany millMy daughter
has small concerntis the manner of womenfolkin politics he
explained to his guests These dangersome days have given her sore
affliction by way of parting comrades of her childhood and others whom
she has much affected It has in some sort soured her

Mr Blossom would have recalled this speech as soon as it escaped him
lest it should lead to a revelation from the truthful Mistress Thankful
of her relations with the Continental captain But to his
astonishment and I may add to my own she showed nothing of that
disposition she had exhibited a few moments before On the contrary
she blushed slightly and said nothing

And then the conversation changedupon the weather the hard winter
the prospects of the Cause a criticism upon the commanderinchiefs
management of affairs the attitude of Congress etc between Mr
Blossom and the count characterized I hardly need say by that
positiveness of opinion that distinguishes the unprofessional In
another part of the room it so chanced that Mistress Thankful and the
baron were talking about themselves the assembly balls who was the
prettiest woman in Morristown and whether Gen Washingtons attentions
to Mistress Pyne were only perfunctory gallantry or what and if Lady
Washingtons hair was really gray and if that young aidedecamp
Major Van Zandt were really in love with Lady or whether his attentions
were only the zeal of a subalternin the midst of which a sudden gust
of wind shook the house and Mr Blossom going to the front door came
back with the announcement that it was snowing heavily

And indeed within that past hour to their astonished eyes the whole
face of nature had changed The moon was gone the sky hidden in a
blinding whirling swarm of stinging flakes The wind bitter and
strong had already fashioned white feathery drifts upon the threshold
over the painted benches on the porch and against the doorposts

Mistress Thankful and the baron had walked to the rear doorthe baron
with a slight tropical shudderto view this meteorological change As
Mistress Thankful looked over the snowy landscape it seemed to her
that all record of her past experience had been effaced her very
footprints of an hour before were lost the gray wall on which she
leaned was white and spotless now even the familiar farmshed looked
dim and strange and ghostly Had she been there had she seen the
captain was it all a fancy She scarcely knew

A sudden gust of wind closed the door behind them with a crash and
sent Mistress Thankful with a slight feminine scream forward into the
outer darkness But the baron caught her by the waist and saved her
from Heaven knows what imaginable disaster and the scene ended in a
halfhysterical laugh But the wind then set upon them both with a
malevolent fury and the baron was I presume obliged to draw her
closer to his side

They were alone save for the presence of those mischievous
confederates Nature and Opportunity In the halfobscurity of the
storm she could not help turning her mischievous eyes on his But she
was perhaps surprised to find them luminous soft and as it seemed to
her at that moment grave beyond the occasion An embarrassment
utterly new and singular seized upon her and when as she half feared
yet half expected he bent down and pressed his lips to hers she was
for a moment powerless But in the next instant she boxed his ears
sharply and vanished in the darkness When Mr Blossom opened the door
to the baron he was surprised to find that gentleman alone and still
more surprised to find when they reentered the house to see Mistress
Thankful enter at the same moment demurely from the front door

When Mr Blossom knocked at his daughters door the next morning it
opened upon her completely dressed but withal somewhat pale and if
the truth must be told a little surly

And you were stirring so early Thankful he said twould have been
but decent to have bidden Godspeed to the guests especially the
baron who seemed much concerned at your absence

Miss Thankful blushed slightly but answered with savage celerity And
since when is it necessary that I should dance attendance upon every
foreign jackinthebox that may lie at the house

He has shown great courtesy to you mistress and is a gentleman

Courtesy indeed said Mistress Thankful

He has not presumed said Mr Blossom suddenly bringing his cold
gray eyes to bear upon his daughters

No no said Thankful hurriedly flaming a bright scarlet
butnothing But what have you there a letter

Ayfrom the captain I warrant said Mr Blossom handing her a
threecornered bit of paper twas left here by a campfollower
Thankful he continued with a meaning glance you will heed my
counsel in season The captain is not meet for such as you

Thankful suddenly grew pale and contemptuous again as she snatched the
letter from his hand When his retiring footsteps were lost on the
stairs she regained her color and opened the letter It was slovenly
written grievously misspelled and read as follows


SWEETHEART A tyranous Act begotten in Envy and Jealousie keeps me
here a prisoner Last night I was Basely arrested by Servile Hands for
that Freedom of Thought and Expression for which I have already
Sacrifized so muchaye all that Man hath but Love and Honour But the
End is Near When for the Maintenance of Power the Liberties of the
Peoples are subdued by Martial Supremacy and the Dictates of Ambition
the State is Lost I lie in Vile Bondage here in Morristown under
charge of Disrespeckme that a twelvemonth past left a home and
Respectable Connexions to serve my Country Believe me still your own
Love albeit in the Power of Tyrants and condemned it may be to the
scaffold

The Messenger is Trustworthy and will speed safely to me such as you
may deliver unto him The Provender sanktified by your Hands and made
precious by yr Love was wrested from me by Servil Hands and the Eggs
Sweetheart were somewhat Addled The Bacon is methinks by this time
on the Table of the ComrinChief Such is Tyranny and Ambition
Sweetheart farewell for the present

ALLAN


Mistress Thankful read this composition once twice and then tore it
up Then reflecting that it was the first letter of her lovers that
she had not kept she tried to put together again the torn fragments
but vainly and then in a pet new to her cast them from the window
During the rest of the day she was considerably distraite and even
manifested more temper than she was wont to do and later when her
father rode away on his daily visit to Morristown she felt strangely
relieved By noon the snow ceased or rather turned into a driving
sleet that again in turn gave way to rain By this time she became
absorbed in her household dutiesin which she was usually
skilfuland in her own thoughts that today had a novelty in their
meaning In the midst of this at about dark her room being in the
rear of the house she was perhaps unmindful of the trampling of horse
without or the sound of voices in the hall below Neither was
uncommon at that time Although protected by the Continental army from
forage or the rudeness of soldiery the Blossom farm had always been a
haltingplace for passing troopers commissary teamsters and
reconnoitring officers Gen Sullivan and Col Hamilton had watered
their horses at its broad substantial wayside trough and sat in the
shade of its porch Miss Thankful was only awakened from her daydream
by the entrance of the negro farmhand Caesar

Fo God Missy Thankful them sogers is gwine into camp in the road
I reckon for theys jest makin theysevs free afo the house and
theys an officer in the companyroom with his spurs cocked on the
table readin a book

A quick flame leaped into Thankfuls cheek and her pretty brows knit
themselves over darkening eyes She arose from her work no longer the
moody girl but an indignant goddess and pushing the servant aside
swept down the stairs and threw open the door

An officer sitting by the fire in an easy lounging attitude that
justified the servants criticism arose instantly with an air of
evident embarrassment and surprise that was however as quickly
dominated and controlled by a gentlemans breeding

I beg your pardon he said with a deep inclination of his handsome
head but I had no idea that there was any member of this household at
homeat least a lady He hesitated a moment catching in the
raising of her brownfringed lids a sudden revelation of her beauty
and partly losing his composure I am Major Van Zandt I have the
honor of addressing

Thankful Blossom said Thankful a little proudly divining with a
womans swift instinct the cause of the majors hesitation But her
triumph was checked by a new embarrassment visible in the face of the
officer at the mention of her name

Thankful Blossom repeated the officer quickly You are then the
daughter of Abner Blossom

Certainly said Thankful turning her inquiring eyes upon him He
will be here betimes He has gone only to Morristown In a new fear
that had taken possession of her her questioning eyes asked Has he
not

The officer answering her eyes rather than her lips came toward her
gravely He will not return today Mistress Thankful nor perhaps
even tomorrow He isa prisoner

Thankful opened her brown eyes aggressively on the major A
prisonerfor what

For aiding and giving comfort to the enemy and for harboring spies
replied the major with military curtness

Mistress Thankfuls cheek flushed slightly at the last sentence a
recollection of the scene on the porch and the barons stolen kiss
flashed across her and for a moment she looked as guilty as if the man
before her had been a witness to the deed He saw it and
misinterpreted her confusion

Belike then said Mistress Thankful slightly raising her voice and
standing squarely before the major belike then I should be a
prisoner too for the guests of this house if they be spies were MY
guests and as my fathers daughter I was their hostess ay man and
right glad to be the hostess of such gallant gentlemengentlemen I
warrant too fine to insult a defenceless girl gentlemen spies that
did not cock their boots on the table or turn an honest farmers house
into a taproom

An expression of half pain half amusement covered the face of the
major but he made no other reply than by a profound and graceful bow
Courteous and deprecatory as it was it apparently exasperated Mistress
Thankful only the more

And pray who are these spies and who is the informer said Mistress
Thankful facing the soldier with one hand truculently placed on her
flexible hip and the other slipped behind her Methinks tis only
honest we should know when and how we have entertained both

Your father Mistress Thankful said Major Van Zandt gravely has
long been suspected of favoring the enemy but it has been the policy
of the commanderinchief to overlook the political preferences of
noncombatants and to strive to win their allegiance to the good cause
by liberal privileges But when it was lately discovered that two
strangers although bearing a pass from him have been frequenters of
this house under fictitious names

You mean Count Ferdinand and the Baron Pomposo said Thankful
quicklytwo honest gentlefolk and if they choose to pay their
devoirs to a lassalthough perhaps not a quality lady yet an honest
girl

Dear Mistress Thankful said the major with a profound bow and smile
that spite of its courtesy drove Thankful to the verge of wrathful
hysterics if you establish that factand from this slight
acquaintance with your charms I doubt not you willyour father is
safe from further inquiry or detention The commanderinchief is a
gentleman who has never underrated the influence of your sex nor held
himself averse to its fascinations

What is the name of this informer broke in Mistress Thankful
angrily Who is it that has dared

It is but kings evidence mayhap Mistress Thankful for the informer
is himself under arrest It is on the information of Capt Allan
Brewster of the Connecticut Contingent

Mistress Thankful whitened then flushed and then whitened again Then
she stood up to the major

Its a liea cowardly lie

Major Van Zandt bowed Mistress Thankful flew up stairs and in
another moment swept back again into the room in riding hat and habit

I suppose I can go and seemy father she said without lifting her
eyes to the officer

You are free as air Mistress Thankful My orders and instructions
far from implicating you in your fathers offences do not even suggest
your existence Let me help you to your horse

The girl did not reply During that brief interval however Caesar
had saddled her white mare and brought it to the door Mistress
Thankful disdaining the offered hand of the major sprang to the
saddle

The major still held the reins One moment Mistress Thankful

Let me go she said with suppressed passion

One moment I beg

His hand still held her bridlerein The mare reared nearly upsetting
her Crimson with rage and mortification she raised her ridingwhip
and laid it smartly over the face of the man before her

He dropped the rein instantly Then he raised to her a face calm and
colorless but for a red line extending from his eyebrow to his chin
and said quietly

I had no desire to detain you I only wished to say that when you see
Gen Washington I know you will be just enough to tell him that Major
Van Zandt knew nothing of your wrongs or even your presence here
until you presented them and that since then he has treated you as
became an officer and a gentleman

Yet even as he spoke she was gone At the moment that her fluttering
skirt swept in a furious gallop down the hillside the major turned
and reentered the house The few lounging troopers who were witnesses
of the scene prudently turned their eyes from the white face and
blazing eyes of their officer as he strode by them Nevertheless when
the door closed behind him contemporary criticism broke out

Tis a Tory jade vexed that she cannot befool the major as she has
the captain muttered Sergeant Tibbitts

And going to try her tricks on the general added Private Hicks

Howbeit both these critics may have been wrong For as Mistress
Thankful thundered down the Morristown road she thought of many things
She thought of her sweetheart Allan a prisoner and pining for HER
help and HER solicitude and yethow dared heif he HAD really
betrayed or misjudged her And then she thought bitterly of the count
and the baron and burned to face the latter and in some vague way
charge the stolen kiss upon him as the cause of all her shame and
mortification And lastly she thought of her father and began to hate
everybody But above all and through all in her vague fears for her
father in her passionate indignation against the baron in her fretful
impatience of Allan one thing was ever dominant and obtrusive one
thing she tried to put away but could notthe handsome colorless
face of Major Van Zandt with the red welt of her ridingwhip overlying
its cold outlines



III

The rising wind which had ridden much faster than Mistress Thankful
had increased to a gale by the time it reached Morristown It swept
through the leafless maples and rattled the dry bones of the elms It
whistled through the quiet Presbyterian churchyard as if trying to
arouse the sleepers it had known in days gone by It shook the blank
lustreless windows of the Assembly Rooms over the Freemasons Tavern
and wrought in their gusty curtains moving shadows of those amply
petticoated dames and tightly hosed cavaliers who had swung in Sir
Roger or jigged in Money Musk the night before

But I fancy it was around the isolated Ford Mansion better known as
the headquarters that the wind wreaked its grotesque rage It howled
under its scant eaves it sang under its bleak porch it tweaked the
peak of its front gable it whistled through every chink and cranny of
its square solid unpicturesque structure Situated on a hillside that
descended rapidly to the Whippany River every summer zephyr that
whispered through the porches of the Morristown farmhouses charged as
a stiff breeze upon the swinging half doors and windows of the Ford
Mansion every wintry wind became a gale that threatened its security
The sentry who paced before its front porch knew from experience when
to linger under its lee and adjust his threadbare outer coat to the
bitter north wind

Within the house something of this cheerlessness prevailed It had an
ascetic gloom which the scant firelight of the receptionroom and the
dying embers on the diningroom hearth failed to dissipate The
central hall was broad and furnished plainly with a few rushbottomed
chairs on one of which half dozed a black bodyservant of the
commanderinchief Two officers in the diningroom drawn close by
the chimneycorner chatted in undertones as if mindful that the door
of the drawingroom was open and their voices might break in upon its
sacred privacy The swinging light in the hall partly illuminated it
or rather glanced gloomily from the black polished furniture the
lustreless chairs the quaint cabinet the silent spinet the
skeletonlegged centretable and finally upon the motionless figure of
a man seated by the fire

It was a figure since so well known to the civilized world since so
celebrated in print and painting as to need no description here Its
rare combination of gentle dignity with profound force of a set
resoluteness of purpose with a philosophical patience have been so
frequently delivered to a people not particularly remarkable for these
qualities that I fear it has too often provoked a spirit of playful
aggression in which the deeper underlying meaning was forgotten So
let me add that in manner physical equipoise and even in the mere
details of dress this figure indicated a certain aristocratic
exclusiveness It was the presentment of a kinga king who by the
irony of circumstances was just then waging war against all kingship a
ruler of men who just then was fighting for the right of these men to
govern themselves but whom by his own inherent right he dominated
From the crown of his powdered head to the silver buckle of his shoe he
was so royal that it was not strange that his brother George of England
and Hanoverruling by accident otherwise impiously known as the
grace of Godcould find no better way of resisting his power than by
calling him Mr Washington

The sound of horses hoofs the formal challenge of sentry the grave
questioning of the officer of the guard followed by footsteps upon the
porch did not apparently disturb his meditation Nor did the opening
of the outer door and a charge of cold air into the hall that invaded
even the privacy of the receptionroom and brightened the dying embers
on the hearth stir his calm preoccupation But an instant later
there was the distinct rustle of a feminine skirt in the hall a
hurried whispering of mens voices and then the sudden apparition of a
smooth freshfaced young officer over the shoulder of the unconscious
figure

I beg your pardon general said the officer doubtingly but

You are not intruding Col Hamilton said the general quietly

There is a young lady without who wishes an audience of your
Excellency Tis Mistress Thankful Blossomthe daughter of Abner
Blossom charged with treasonous practice and favoring the enemy now
in the guardhouse at Morristown

Thankful Blossom repeated the general interrogatively

Your Excellency doubtless remembers a little provincial beauty and a
famous toast of the countrysidethe Cressida of our Morristown epic
who led our gallant Connecticut captain astray

You have the advantages besides the better memory of a younger man
colonel said Washington with a playful smile that slightly reddened
the cheek of his aidedecamp Yet I think I HAVE heard of this
phenomenon By all means admit herand her escort

She is alone general responded the subordinate

Then the more reason why we should be polite returned Washington
for the first time altering his easy posture rising to his feet and
lightly clasping his ruffled hands before him We must not keep her
waiting Give her access my dear colonel at once and even as she
cameALONE

The aidedecamp bowed and withdrew In another moment the halfopened
door swung wide to Mistress Thankful Blossom

She was so beautiful in her simple ridingdress so quaint and original
in that very beauty and above all so teeming with a certain vital
earnestness of purpose just positive and audacious enough to set off
that beauty that the grave gentleman before her did not content
himself with the usual formal inclination of courtesy but actually
advanced and taking her cold little hand in his graciously led her
to the chair he had just vacated

Even if your name were not known to me Mistress Thankful said the
commanderinchief looking down upon her with grave politeness
nature has methinks spared you the necessity of any introduction to
the courtesy of a gentleman But how can I especially serve you

Alack the blaze of Mistress Thankfuls brown eyes had become somewhat
dimmed in the grave halflights of the room in the graver deeper
dignity of the erect soldierlike figure before her The bright color
born of the tempest within and without had somehow faded from her
cheek the sauciness begotten from bullying her horse in the last
halfhours rapid ride was so subdued by the actual presence of the man
she had come to bully that I fear she had to use all her selfcontrol
to keep down her inclination to whimper and to keep back the tears
that oddly enough rose to her sweet eyes as she lifted them to the
quietly critical yet placid glance of her interlocutor

I can readily conceive the motive of this visit Miss Thankful
continued Washington with a certain dignified kindliness that was more
reassuring than the formal gallantry of the period and it is I
protest to your credit A fathers welfare however erring and weak
that father may be is most seemly in a maiden

Thankfuls eyes flashed again as she rose to her feet Her upper lip
that had a moment before trembled in a pretty infantine distress now
stiffened and curled as she confronted the dignified figure before her
It is not of my father I would speak she said saucily I did not
ride here alone tonight in this weather to talk of HIM I warrant HE
can speak for himself I came here to speak of myself of liesay
LIES told of me a poor girl ay of cowardly gossip about me and my
sweetheart Capt Brewster now confined in prison because he hath
loved me a lass without polities or adherence to the causeas if
twere necessary every lad should ask the confidence or permission of
yourself or belike my Lady Washington in his preferences

She paused a moment out of breath With a womans quickness of
intuition she saw the change in Washingtons facesaw a certain cold
severity overshadowing it With a womans fateful persistencya
persistency which I humbly suggest might on occasion be honorably
copied by our more politic sexshe went on to say what was in her
even if she were obliged with a womans honorable inconsistency to
unsay it an hour or two later an inconsistency which I also humbly
protest might be as honorably imitated by uson occasion

It has been said said Thankful Blossom quickly that my father has
given entertainment knowingly to two spiestwo spies that begging
your Excellencys pardon and the pardon of Congress I know only as
two honorable gentlemen who have as honorably tendered me their
affections It is said and basely and most falsely too that my
sweetheart Capt Allan Brewster has lodged this information I have
ridden here to deny it I have ridden here to demand of you that an
honest womans reputation shall not be sacrificed to the interests of
politics that a prying mob of ragamuffins shall not be sent to an
honest farmers house to spy and spyand turn a poor girl out of doors
that they might do it Tis shameful so it is there tis most
scandalous so it is there now Spies indeed what are THEY pray

In the indignation which the recollection of her wrongs had slowly
gathered in her from the beginning of this speech she had advanced
her face rosy with courage and beautiful in its impertinence within
a few inches of the dignified features and quiet gray eyes of the great
commander To her utter stupefaction he bent his head and kissed her
with a grave benignity full on the centre of her audacious forehead

Be seated I beg Mistress Blossom he said taking her cold hand in
his and quietly replacing her in the unoccupied chair Be seated I
beg and give me if you can your attention for a moment The officer
intrusted with the ungracious task of occupying your fathers house is
a member of my military family and a gentleman If he has so far
forgotten himselfif he has so far disgraced himself and me as

No no uttered Thankful with feverish alacrity the gentleman was
most considerate On the contrarymayhapIshe hesitated and then
came to a full stop with a heightened color as a vivid recollection
of that gentlemans face with the mark of her ridingwhip lying across
it rose before her

I was about to say that Major Van Zandt as a gentleman has known how
to fully excuse the natural impulses of a daughter continued
Washington with a look of perfect understanding but let me now
satisfy you on another point where it would seem we greatly differ

He walked to the door and summoned his servant to whom he gave an
order In another moment the freshfaced young officer who had at
first admitted her reappeared with a file of official papers He
glanced slyly at Thankful Blossoms face with an amused look as if he
had already heard the colloquy between her and his superior officer
and had appreciated that which neither of the earnest actors in the
scene had themselves felta certain sense of humor in the situation

Howbeit standing before them Col Hamilton gravely turned over the
file of papers Thankful bit her lips in embarrassment A slight
feeling of awe and a presentiment of some fastcoming shame a new and
strange consciousness of herself her surroundings of the dignity of
the two men before her an uneasy feeling of the presence of two ladies
who had in some mysterious way entered the room from another door and
who seemed to be intently regarding her from afar with a curiosity as
if she were some strange animal and a wild premonition that her whole
future life and happiness depended upon the events of the next few
momentsso took possession of her that the brave girl trembled for a
moment in her isolation and loneliness In another instant Col
Hamilton speaking to his superior but looking obviously at one of the
ladies who had entered handed a paper to Washington and said Here
are the charges

Read them said the general coldly

Col Hamilton with a manifest consciousness of another hearer than
Mistress Blossom and his general read the paper It was couched in
phrases of military and legal precision and related briefly that upon
the certain and personal knowledge of the writer Abner Blossom of the
Blossom Farm was in the habit of entertaining two gentlemen namely
the Count Ferdinand and the Baron Pomposo suspected enemies of the
cause and possible traitors to the Continental army It was signed by
Allan Brewster late captain in the Connecticut Contingent

As Col Hamilton exhibited the signature Thankful Blossom had no
difficulty in recognizing the familiar bad hand and equally familiar
misspelling of her lover

She rose to her feet With eyes that showed her present trouble and
perplexity as frankly as they had a moment before blazed with her
indignation she met one by one the glances of the group who now
seemed to be closing round her Yet with a womans instinct she felt
I am constrained to say more unfriendliness in the silent presence of
the two women than in the possible outspoken criticism of our
muchabused sex

Of course said a voice which Thankful at once by a womans unerring
instinct recognized as the elder of the two ladies and the legitimate
keeper of the conscience of some one of the men who were presentof
course Mistress Thankful will be able to elect which of her lovers
among her countrys enemies she will be able to cling to for support in
her present emergency She does not seem to have been so special in
her favors as to have positively excluded any one

At least dear Lady Washington she will not give it to the man who
has proven a traitor to HER said the younger woman impulsively
That isI beg your ladyships pardonshe hesitated observing in
the dead silence that ensued that the two superior male beings present
looked at each other in lofty astonishment

He that is traitrous to his country said Lady Washington coldly
is apt to be traitrous elsewhere

Twere as honest to say that he that was traitrous to his king was
traitrous to his country said Mistress Thankful with sudden
audacity bending her knit brows on Lady Washington But that lady
turned dignifiedly away and Mistress Thankful again faced the general

I ask your pardon she said proudly for troubling you with my
wrongs But it seems to me that even if another and a greater wrong
were done me by my sweetheart through jealousy it would not justify
this accusation against me even though she added darting a wicked
glance at the placid brocaded back of Lady Washington even though
that accusation came from one who knows that jealousy may belong to the
wife of a patriot as well as a traitor She was herself again after
this speech although her face was white with the blow she had taken
and returned

Col Hamilton passed his hand across his mouth and coughed slightly
Gen Washington standing by the fire with an impassive face turned to
Thankful gravely

You are forgetting Mistress Thankful that you have not told me how I
can serve you It cannot be that you are still concerned in Capt
Brewster who has given evidence against your otherFRIENDS and
tacitly against YOU Nor can it be on their account for I regret to
say they are still free and unknown If you come with any information
exculpating them and showing they are not spies or hostile to the
cause your fathers release shall be certain and speedy Let me ask
you a single question Why do you believe them honest

Because said Mistress Thankful they wereweregentlemen

Many spies have been of excellent family good address and fair
talents said Washington gravely but you have mayhap some other
reason

Because they talked only to ME said Mistress Thankful blushing
mightily because they preferred my company to fathers becauseshe
hesitated a momentbecause they spoke not of politics butofthat
which lads mainly talk ofandandhere she broke down a
littleand the baron I only saw once but hehere she broke down
utterlyI know they werent spies there now

I must ask you something more said Washington with grave kindness
whether you give me the information or not you will consider that
if what you believe is true it cannot in any way injure the gentlemen
you speak of while on the other hand it may relieve your father of
suspicion Will you give to Col Hamilton my secretary a full
description of themthat fuller description which Capt Brewster for
reasons best known to yourself was unable to give

Mistress Thankful hesitated for a moment and then with one of her
truthful glances at the commanderinchief began a detailed account of
the outward semblance of the count Why she began with him I am
unable to say but possibly it was because it was easier for when she
came to describe the baron she was I regret to say somewhat vague
and figurative Not so vague however but that Col Hamilton suddenly
started up with a look at his chief who instantly checked it with a
gesture of his ruffled hand

I thank you Mistress Thankful he said quite impassively but did
this other gentleman this baron

Pomposo said Thankful proudly A titter originated in the group of
ladies by the window and became visible on the fresh face of Col
Hamilton but the dignified color of Washingtons countenance was
unmoved

May I ask if the baron made an honorable tender of his affections to
you he continued with respectful gravityif his attentions were
known to your father and were such as honest Mistress Blossom could
receive

Father introduced him to me and wanted me to be kind to him Hehe
kissed me and I slapped his face said Thankful quickly with cheeks
as red I warrant as the barons might have been

The moment the words had escaped her truthful lips she would have
given her life to recall them To her astonishment however Col
Hamilton laughed outright and the ladies turned and approached her
but were checked by a slight gesture from the otherwise impassive
figure of the general

It is possible Mistress Thankful he resumed with undisturbed
composure that one at least of these gentlemen may be known to us
and that your instincts may be correct At least rest assured that we
shall fully inquire into it and that your father shall have the
benefit of that inquiry

I thank your Excellency said Thankful still reddening under the
contemplation of her own late frankness and retreating toward the
door IthinkImustgonow It is late and I have far to
ride

To her surprise however Washington stepped forward and again taking
her hands in his said with a grave smile For that very reason if
for none other you must be our guest tonight Mistress Thankful
Blossom We still retain our Virginian ideas of hospitality and are
tyrannous enough to make strangers conform to them even though we have
but perchance the poorest of entertainment to offer them Lady
Washington will not permit Mistress Thankful Blossom to leave her roof
tonight until she has partaken of her courtesy as well as her counsel

Mistress Thankful Blossom will make us believe that she has at least
in so far trusted our desire to serve her justly by accepting our poor
hospitality for a single night said Lady Washington with a stately
courtesy

Thankful Blossom still stood irresolutely at the door But the next
moment a pair of youthful arms encircled her and the younger
gentlewoman looking into her brown eyes with an honest frankness equal
to her own said caressingly Dear Mistress Thankful though I am but
a guest in her ladyships house let me I pray you add my voice to
hers I am Mistress Schuyler of Albany at your service Mistress
Thankful as Col Hamilton here will bear me witness did I need any
interpreter to your honest heart Believe me dear Mistress Thankful
I sympathize with you and only beg you to give me an opportunity
tonight to serve you You will stay I know and you will stay with
me and we shall talk over the faithlessness of that overjealous
Yankee captain who has proved himself I doubt not as unworthy of YOU
as he is of his country

Hateful to Thankful as was the idea of being commiserated she
nevertheless could not resist the gentle courtesy and gracious sympathy
of Miss Schuyler Besides it must be confessed that for the first
time in her life she felt a doubt of the power of her own independence
and a strange fascination for this young gentlewoman whose arms were
around her who could so thoroughly sympathize with her and yet allow
herself to be snubbed by Lady Washington

You have a mother I doubt not said Thankful raising her
questioning eyes to Miss Schuyler

Irrelevant as this question seemed to the two gentlemen Miss Schuyler
answered it with feminine intuition And you dear Mistress Thankful

Have none said Thankful and here I regret to say she whimpered
slightly at which Miss Schuyler with tears in her own fine eyes bent
her head suddenly to Thankfuls ear put her arm about the waist of the
pretty stranger and then to the astonishment of Col Hamilton
quietly swept her out of the august presence

When the door had closed upon them Col Hamilton turned
halfsmilingly halfinquiringly to his chief Washington returned
his glance kindly but gravely and then said quietly

If your suspicions jump with mine colonel I need not remind you that
it is a matter so delicate that it would be as well if you locked it in
your own breast for the present at least that you should not intimate
to the gentleman whom you may have suspected aught that has passed
this evening

As you will general said the subaltern respectfully but may I
askhe hesitatedif you believe that anything more than a passing
fancy for a pretty girl

When I asked your silence colonel interrupted Washington kindly
laying his hand upon the shoulder of the younger man it was because I
thought the matter sufficiently momentous to claim my own private and
especial attention

I ask your Excellencys pardon said the young man reddening through
his fresh complexion like a girl I only meant

That you would ask to be relieved tonight interrupted Washington
with a benign smile forasmuch as you wished the more to show
entertainment to our dear friend Miss Schuyler and her guest a
wayward girl colonel but methinks an honest one Treat her of your
own quality colonel but discreetly and not too kindly lest we have
Mistress Schuyler another injured damsel on our hands and with a
half playful gesture peculiar to the man and yet not inconsistent with
his dignity he half led half pushed his youthful secretary from the
room

When the door had closed upon the colonel Lady Washington rustled
toward her husband who stood still quiet and passive on the
hearthstone

You surely see in this escapade nothing of political intrigueno
treachery she said hastily

No said Washington quietly

Nothing more than an idle wanton intrigue with a foolish vain
country girl

Pardon me my lady said Washington gravely I doubt not we may
misjudge her Tis no common rustic lass that can thus stir the
country side Twere an insult to your sex to believe it It is not
yet sure that she has not captured even so high game as she has named
If she has it would add another interest to a treaty of comity and
alliance

That creature said Lady Washingtonthat lightolove with her
Connecticut captain lover Pardon me but this is preposterous and
with a stiff courtesy she swept from the room leaving the central
figure of historyas such central figures are apt to be leftalone

Later in the evening Mistress Schuyler so far subdued the tears and
emotions of Thankful that she was enabled to dry her eyes and
rearrange her brown hair in the quaint little mirror in Mistress
Schuylers chamber Mistress Schuyler herself lending a touch and
suggestion here and there after the secret freemasonry of her sex
You are well rid of this forsworn captain dear Mistress Thankful and
methinks that with hair as beautiful as yours the new style of wearing
it though a modish frivolity is most becoming I assure you tis
much affected in New York and Philadelphiadrawn straight back from
the forehead after this manner as you see

The result was that an hour later Mistress Schuyler and Mistress
Blossom presented themselves to Col Hamilton in the receptionroom
with a certain freshness and elaboration of toilet that not only quite
shamed the young officers affaire negligence but caused him to open
his eyes in astonishment Perhaps she would rather be alone that she
might indulge her grief he said doubtingly in an aside to Miss
Schuyler rather than appear in company

Nonsense quoth Mistress Schuyler Is a young woman to mope and
sigh because her lover proves false

But her father is a prisoner said Hamilton in amazement

Can you look me in the face said Mistress Schuyler mischievously
and tell me that you dont know that in twentyfour hours her father
will be cleared of these charges Nonsense Do you think I have no
eyes in my head Do you think I misread the generals face and your
own

But my dear girl said the officer in alarm

Oh I told her so but not WHY responded Miss Schuyler with a wicked
look in her dark eyes though I had warrant enough to do so to serve
you for keeping a secret from ME

And with this Parthian shot she returned to Mistress Thankful who
with her face pressed against the window was looking out on the
moonlit slope beside the Whippany River

For by one of those freaks peculiar to the American springtide the
weather had again marvellously changed The rain had ceased and the
ground was covered with an icing of sleet and snow that now glittered
under a clear sky and a brilliant moon The northeast wind that shook
the loose sashes of the windows had transformed each dripping tree and
shrub to icy stalactites that silvered under the moons cold touch

Tis a beautiful sight ladies said a bluff hearty middleaged
man joining the group by the window But God send the spring to us
quickly and spare us any more such cruel changes My lady moon looks
fine enough glittering in yonder treetops but I doubt not she looks
down upon many a poor fellow shivering under his tattered blankets in
the camp beyond Had ye seen the Connecticut tatterdemalions file by
last night with arms reversed showing their teeth at his Excellency
and yet not daring to bite had ye watched these fainthearts these
doubting Thomases ripe for rebellion against his Excellency against
the cause but chiefly against the weatherye would pray for a thaw
that would melt the hearts of these men as it would these stubborn
fields around us Two weeks more of such weather would raise up not one
Allan Brewster but a dozen such malcontent puppies ripe for a
drumhead courtmartial

Yet tis a fine night Gen Sullivan said Col Hamilton sharply
nudging the ribs of his superior officer with his elbow There would
be little trouble on such a night I fancy to track our ghostly
visitant Both of the ladies becoming interested and Col Hamilton
having thus adroitly turned the flank of his superior officer he went
on You should know that the camp and indeed the whole locality here
is said to be haunted by the apparition of a graycoated figure whose
face is muffled and hidden in his collar but who has the password pat
to his lips and whose identity hath baffled the sentries This
figure it is said forasmuch as it has been seen just before an
assault an attack or some tribulation of the army is believed by
many to be the genius or guardian spirit of the cause and as such
has incited sentries and guards to greater vigilance and has to some
seemed a premonition of disaster Before the last outbreak of the
Connecticut militia Master Graycoat haunted the outskirts of the
weatherbeaten and bedraggled camp and I doubt not saw much of that
preparation that sent that regiment of fainthearted oniongatherers to
flaunt their woes and their wrongs in the face of the general himself

Here Col Hamilton in turn received a slight nudge from Mistress
Schuyler and ended his speech somewhat abruptly

Mistress Thankful was not unmindful of both these allusions to her
faithless lover but only a consciousness of mortification and wounded
pride was awakened by them In fact during the first tempest of her
indignation at his arrest still later at the arrest of her father and
finally at the discovery of his perfidy to her she had forgotten that
he was her lover she had forgotten her previous tenderness toward him
and now that her fire and indignation were spent only a sense of
numbness and vacancy remained All that had gone before seemed not
something to be regretted as her own act but rather as the act of
another Thankful Blossom who had been lost that night in the
snowstorm she felt she had become within the last twentyfour hours
not perhaps ANOTHER woman but for the first time a WOMEN

Yet it was singular that she felt more confused when a few moments
later the conversation turned upon Major Van Zandt it was still more
singular that she even felt considerably frightened at that confusion
Finally she found herself listening with alternate irritability shame
and curiosity to praises of that gentleman of his courage his
devotion and his personal graces For one wild moment Thankful felt
like throwing herself on the breast of Mistress Schuyler and
confessing her rudeness to the major but a conviction that Mistress
Schuyler would share that secret with Col Hamilton that Major Van
Zandt might not like that revelation and oddly enough associated with
this a feeling of unconquerable irritability toward that handsome and
gentle young officer kept her mouth closed Besides she said to
herself he ought to know if hes such a fine gentleman as they say
just how I was feeling and that I dont mean any rudeness to him and
with this unanswerable feminine logic poor Thankful to some extent
stilled her own honest little heart

But not I fear entirely The night was a restless one to her like
all impulsive natures the season of reflection and perhaps distrust
came to her upon acts that were already committed and when reason
seemed to light the way only to despair She saw the folly of her
intrusion at the headquarters as she thought only when it was too
late to remedy it she saw the gracelessness and discourtesy of her
conduct to Major Van Zandt only when distance and time rendered an
apology weak and ineffectual I think she cried a little to herself
lying in the strange gloomy chamber of the healthfully sleeping
Mistress Schuyler the sweet security of whose manifest goodness and
kindness she alternately hated and envied and at last unable to stand
it longer slipped noiselessly from her bed and stood very wretched
and disconsolate before the window that looked out upon the slope
toward the Whippany River The moon on the newfallen frigid and
untrodden snow shone brightly Far to the left it glittered on the
bayonet of a sentry pacing beside the riverbank and gave a sense of
security to the girl that perhaps strengthened another idea that had
grown up in her mind Since she could not sleep why should she not
ramble about until she could She had been accustomed to roam about
the farm in all weathers and at all times and seasons She recalled to
herself the nighta tempestuous onewhen she had risen in serious
concern as to the lyingin of her favorite Alderney heifer and how she
had saved the life of the calf a weakling dropped apparently from the
clouds in the tempest as it lay beside the barn With this in her
mind she donned her dress again and with Mistress Schuylers mantle
over her shoulders noiselessly crept down the narrow staircase passed
the sleeping servant on the settee and opening the rear door in
another moment was inhaling the crisp air and tripping down the crisp
snow of the hillside

But Mistress Thankful had overlooked one difference between her own
farm and a military encampment She had not proceeded a dozen yards
before a figure apparently started out of the ground beneath her and
levelling a bayoneted musket across her path called Halt

The hot blood mounted to the girls cheek at the first imperative
command she had ever received in her life nevertheless she halted
unconsciously and without a word confronted the challenger with her
old audacity

Who comes there reiterated the sentry still keeping his bayonet
level with her breast

Thankful Blossom she responded promptly

The sentry brought his musket to a present Pass Thankful Blossom
and God send it soon and the spring with it and goodnight he said
with a strong Milesian accent And before the stillamazed girl could
comprehend the meaning of his abrupt challenge or his equally abrupt
departure he had resumed his monotonous pace in the moonlight
Indeed as she stood looking after him the whole episode the odd
unreality of the moonlit landscape the novelty of her position the
morbid play of her thoughts seemed to make it part of a dream which
the morning light might dissipate but could never fully explain

With something of this feeling still upon her she kept her way to the
river Its banks were still fringed with ice through which its dark
current flowed noiselessly She knew it flowed through the camp where
lay her faithless lover and for an instant indulged the thought of
following it and facing him with the proof of his guilt but even at
the thought she recoiled with a new and sudden doubt in herself and
stood dreamily watching the shimmer of the moon on the icy banks until
another and it seemed to her equally unreal vision suddenly stayed
her feet and drove the blood from her feverish cheeks

A figure was slowly approaching from the direction of the sleeping
encampment Tall erect and habited in a gray surtout with a hood
partially concealing its face it was the counterfeit presentment of
the ghostly visitant she had heard described Thankful scarcely
breathed The brave little heart that had not quailed before the
sentrys levelled musket a moment before now faltered and stood still
as the phantom with a slow and majestic tread moved toward her She
had only time to gain the shelter of a tree before the figure
majestically unconscious of her presence passed slowly by Through
all her terror Thankful was still true to a certain rustic habit of
practical perception to observe that the tread of the phantom was quite
audible over the crust of snow and was visible and palpable as the
imprint of a military boot

The blood came back to Thankfuls cheek and with it her old audacity
In another instant she was out from the tree and tracking with a light
feline tread the apparition that now loomed up the hill before her
Slipping from tree to tree she followed until it passed before the
door of a low hut or farmshed that stood midway up the hill Here it
entered and the door closed behind it With every sense feverishly
alert Thankful from the secure advantage of a large maple watched
the door of the hut In a few moments it reopened to the same figure
free of its gray enwrappings Forgetful of every thing now but
detecting the face of the impostor the fearless girl left the tree
and placed herself directly in the path of the figure At the same
moment it turned toward her inquiringly and the moonlight fell full
upon the calm composed features of Gen Washington

In her consternation Thankful could only drop an embarrassed courtesy
and hang out two lovely signals of distress in her cheeks The face of
the pseudo ghost alone remained unmoved

You are wandering late Mistress Thankful he said at last with a
paternal gravity and I fear that the formal restraint of a military
household has already given you some embarrassment Yonder sentry for
instance might have stopped you

Oh he did said Thankful quickly but its all right please your
Excellency He asked me Who went there and I told him and he was
vastly polite I assure you

The grave features of the commanderinchief relaxed in a smile You
are more happy than most of your sex in turning a verbal compliment to
practical account For know then dear young lady that in honor of
your visit to the headquarters the password tonight through this
encampment was none other than your own pretty patronymicThankful
Blossom

The tears glittered in the girls eyes and her lip trembled but with
all her readiness of speech she could only say Oh your Excellency

Then you DID pass the sentry continued Washington looking at her
intently with a certain grave watchfulness in his gray eyes And
doubtless you wandered at the riverbank Although I myself tempted
by the night sometimes extend my walk as far as yonder shed it were a
hazardous act for a young lady to pass beyond the protection of the
line

Oh I met no one your Excellency said the usually truthful Thankful
hastily rushing to her first lie with grateful impetuosity

And saw no one asked Washington quietly

No one said Thankful raising her brown eyes to the generals

They both looked at each otherthe naturally most veracious young
woman in the colonies and the subsequent allegorical impersonation of
truth in Americaand knew each other lied and I imagine respected
each other for it

I am glad to hear you say so Mistress Thankful said Washington
quietly for twould have been natural for you to have sought an
interview with your recreant lover in yonder camp though the attempt
would have been unwise and impossible

I had no such thought your Excellency said Thankful who had really
quite forgotten her late intention yet if with your permission I
could hold a few moments converse with Capt Brewster it would
greatly ease my mind

Twould not be well for the present said Washington thoughtfully
But in a day or two Capt Brewster will be tried by courtmartial at
Morristown It shall be so ordered that when he is conveyed thither
his guard shall halt at the Blossom Farm I will see that the officer
in command gives you an opportunity to see him And I think I can
promise also Mistress Thankful that your father shall be also present
under his own roof a free man

They had reached the entrance to the mansion and entered the hall
Thankful turned impulsively and kissed the extended hand of the
commander You are so good I have been so foolishso very very
wrong she said with a slight trembling of her lip And your
Excellency believes my story and those gentlemen were NOT spies but
even as they gave themselves to be

I said not that much replied Washington with a kindly smile but no
matter Tell me rather Mistress Thankful how far your acquaintance
with these gentlemen has gone or did it end with the box on the ear
that you gave the baron

He had asked me to ride with him to the Baskingridge and Ihad
saidyes faltered Mistress Thankful

Unless I misjudge you Mistress Thankful you can without great
sacrifice promise me that you will not see him until I give you my
permission said Washington with grave playfulness

The swinging light shone full in Thankfuls truthful eyes as she lifted
them to his

I do she said quietly

Goodnight said the commander with a formal bow

Goodnight your Excellency



IV

The sun was high over the Short Hills when Mistress Thankful the next
day drew up her sweating mare beside the Blossom Farm gate She had
never looked prettier she had never felt more embarrassed as she
entered her own house During her rapid ride she had already framed a
speech of apology to Major Van Zandt which however utterly fled from
her lips as that officer showed himself respectfully on the threshold
Yet she permitted him to usurp the functions of the grinning Caesar
and help her from her horse albeit she was conscious of exhibiting the
awkward timidity of a bashful rustic until at last with a stammering
Thank ye she actually ran up stairs to hide her glowing face and far
too conscious eyelids

During the rest of that day Major Van Zandt quietly kept out of the
way without obtrusively seeming to avoid her Yet when they met
casually in the performance of her household duties the innocent
Mistress Thankful noticed under her downcast penitential eyelids that
the eyes of the officer followed her intently And thereat she fell
unconsciously to imitating him and so they eyed each other furtively
like cats and rubbed themselves along the walls of rooms and passages
when they met lest they should seem designedly to come near each
other and enacted the gravest and most formal of genuflexions
courtesies and bows when they accidentally DID meet And just at the
close of the second day as the elegant Major Van Zandt was feeling
himself fast becoming a drivelling idiot and an awkward country booby
the arrival of a courier from headquarters saved that gentleman his
selfrespect forever

Mistress Thankful was in her sittingroom when he knocked at her door
She opened it in sudden conscious trepidation

I ask pardon for intruding Mistress Thankful Blossom he said
gravely but I have herehe held out a pretentious documenta
letter for you from headquarters May I hope that it contains good
newsthe release of your fatherand that it relieves you from my
presence and an espionage which I assure you cannot be more unpleasant
to you than it has been to myself

As he entered the room Thankful had risen to her feet with the full
intention of delivering to him her little set apology but as he ended
his speech she looked at him blankly and burst out crying

Of course he was in an instant at her side and holding her cold little
hand Then she managed to say between her tears that she had been
wanting to make an apology to him that she had wanted to say ever
since she arrived that she had been rude very rude and that she knew
he never could forgive her that she had been trying to say that she
never could forget his gentle forbearance only she added suddenly
raising her tearfringed brown lids to the astonished man YOU
WOULDNT EVER LET ME

Dear Mistress Thankful said the major in consciencestricken
horror if I have made myself distant to you believe me it was only
because I feared to intrude upon your sorrow I reallydear Mistress
ThankfulI

When you took all the pains to go round the hall instead of through
the diningroom lest I should ask you to forgive me sobbed Mistress
Thankful I thoughtyoumusthate me and preferred to

Perhaps this letter may mitigate your sorrow Mistress Thankful said
the officer pointing to the letter she still held unconsciously in her
hand

With a blush at her preoccupation Thankful opened the letter It was
a halfofficial document and ran as follows


The CommanderinChief is glad to inform Mistress Thankful Blossom
that the charges preferred against her father have upon fair
examination been found groundless and trivial The CommanderinChief
further begs to inform Mistress Blossom that the gentleman known to her
under the name of the Baron Pomposo was his Excellency Don Juan
Morales Ambassador and Envoy Extraordinary of the Court of Spain and
that the gentleman known to her as the Count Ferdinand was Senor
Godoy Secretary to the Embassy The CommanderinChief wishes to add
that Mistress Thankful Blossom is relieved of any further obligation of
hospitality toward these honorable gentlemen as the CommanderinChief
regrets to record the sudden and deeplytobedeplored death of his
Excellency this morning by typhoid fever and the possible speedy
return of the Embassy

In conclusion the CommanderinChief wishes to bear testimony to the
Truthfulness Intuition and Discretion of Mistress Thankful Blossom

By order of his Excellency
 Gen GEORGE WASHINGTON

ALEX HAMILTON Secretary

To Mistress THANKFUL BLOSSOM of Blossom Farm


Thankful Blossom was silent for a few moments and then raised her
abashed eyes to Major Van Zandt A single glance satisfied her that he
knew nothing of the imposture that had been practised upon herknew
nothing of the trap into which her vanity and selfwill had led her

Dear Mistress Thankful said the major seeing the distress in her
face I trust the news is not ill Surely I gathered from the
sergeant that

What said Thankful looking at him intently

That in twentyfour hours at furthest your father would be free and
that I should be relieved

I know that you are aweary of your task major said Thankful
bitterly rejoice then to know your information is correct and that
my father is exoneratedunlessunless this is a forgery and Gen
Washington should turn out to be somebody else and YOU should turn out
to be somebody else And she stopped short and hid her wet eyes in
the windowcurtains

Poor girl said Major Van Zandt to himself This trouble has
undoubtedly frenzied her Fool that I was to lay up the insult of one
that sorrow and excitement had bereft of reason and responsibility
Twere better I should retire at once and leave her to herself and
the young man slowly retreated toward the door

But at this moment there were alarming symptoms of distress in the
windowcurtain and the major paused as a voice from its dimity depths
said plaintively And YOU are going without forgiving me

Forgive YOU Mistress Thankful said the major striding to the
curtain and seizing a little hand that was obtruded from its
foldsforgive you rather can you forgive me for the follythe
cruelty of mistakingofofand here the major hitherto famous for
facile compliments utterly broke down But the hand he held was no
longer cold but warm and intelligent and in default of coherent
speech he held fast by that as the thread of his discourse until
Mistress Thankful quietly withdrew it thanked him for his forgiveness
and retired deeper behind the curtain

When he had gone she threw herself in a chair and again gave way to a
passionate flood of tears In the last twentyfour hours her pride had
been utterly humbled the independent spirit of this selfwilled little
beauty had met for the first time with defeat When she had got over
her womanly shock at the news of the sham barons death she had I
fear only a selfish regard at his taking off believing that if living
he would in some way show the worldwhich just then consisted of the
headquarters and Major Van Zandtthat he had really made love to her
and possibly did honorably love her still and might yet give her an
opportunity to reject him And now he was dead and she was held up to
the world as the conceited plaything of a fine gentlemans masquerading
sport That her fathers cupidity and ambition made him sanction the
imposture in her bitterness she never doubted No Lover friend
fatherall had been false to her and the only kindness she had
received was from the men she had wantonly insulted Poor little
Blossom indeed a most premature Blossom I fear a most unthankful
Blossom sitting there shivering in the first chill wind of adversity
rocking backward and forward with the skirt of her dimity shortgown
over her shoulders and her little buckled shoes and clocked stockings
pathetically crossed before her

But healthy youth is reactive and in an hour or two Thankful was down
at the cowshed with her arms around the neck of her favorite heifer
to whom she poured out much of her woes and from whom she won an
intelligent sort of slobbering sympathy And then she sharply scolded
Caesar for nothing at all and a moment after returned to the house
with the air and face of a deeply injured angel who had been
disappointed in some celestial idea of setting this world right but
was still not above forgivenessa spectacle that sunk Major Van Zandt
into the dark depths of remorse and eventually sent him to smoke a
pipe of Virginia with his men in the roadside camp seeing which
Thankful went early to bed and cried herself to sleep And Nature
possibly followed her example for at sunset a great thaw set in and
by midnight the freed rivers and brooks were gurgling melodiously and
tree and shrub and fence were moist and dripping

The red dawn at last struggled through the vaporous veil that hid the
landscape Then occurred one of those magical changes peculiar to the
climate yet perhaps preeminently notable during that historic winter
and spring By ten oclock on that 3d of May 1780 a fervent
Junelike sun had rent that vaporous veil and poured its direct rays
upon the gaunt and haggard profile of the Jersey hills The chilled
soil responded but feebly to that kiss perhaps a few of the willows
that yellowed the riverbanks took on a deeper color But the country
folk were certain that spring had come at last and even the correct
and selfsustained Major Van Zandt came running in to announce to
Mistress Thankful that one of his men had seen a violet in the meadow
In another moment Mistress Thankful had donned her cloak and pattens to
view this firstling of the laggard summer It was quite natural that
Major Van Zandt should accompany her as she tripped on and so without
a thought of their past differences they ran like very children down
the moist and rocky slope that led to the quaggy meadow Such was the
influence of the vernal season

But the violets were hidden Mistress Thankful regardless of the wet
leaves and her new gown groped with her fingers among the withered
grasses Major Van Zandt leaned against a bowlder and watched her
with admiring eyes

Youll never find flowers that way she said at last looking up to
him impatiently Go down on your knees like an honest man There are
some things in this world worth stooping for

The major instantly dropped on his knees beside her But at that
moment Mistress Thankful found her posies and rose to her feet Stay
where you are she said mischievously as she stooped down and placed
a flower in the lapel of his coat That is to make amends for my
rudeness Now get up

But the major did not rise He caught the two little hands that had
seemed to flutter like birds against his breast and looking up into
the laughing face above him said Dear Mistress Thankful dare I
remind you of your own words that there be some things worth stooping
for Think of my love Mistress Thankful as a flowermayhap not as
gracious to you as your violets but as honest andandandas

Ready to spring up in a single night laughed Thankful But no get
up major What would the fine ladies of Morristown say of your
kneeling at the feet of a country girlthe play and sport of every
fine gentleman What if Mistress Bolton should see her own cavalier
the modish Major Van Zandt proffering his affections to the disgraced
sweetheart of a perjured traitor Leave go my hand I pray you
majorif you respect

She was free yet she faltered a moment beside him with tears
quivering on her long brown lashes Then she said tremulously Rise
up major Let us think no more of this I pray you forgive me if I
have again been rude

The major struggled to rise to his feet But he could not And then I
regret to have to record that the fact became obvious that one of his
shapely legs was in a boghole and that he was perceptibly sinking out
of sight Whereat Mistress Thankful trilled out a threesyllabled
laugh looked demure and painfully concerned at his condition and then
laughed again The major joined in her mirth albeit his face was
crimson And then with a little cry of alarm she flew to his side
and put her arms around him

Keep away keep away for Heavens sake Mistress Blossom he said
quickly or I shall plunge you into my mishap and make you as
ridiculous as myself

But the quickwitted girl had already leaped to an adjacent bowlder
Take off your sash she said quickly fasten it to your belt and
throw it to me He did so She straightened herself back on the
rock Now all together she cried with a preliminary strain on the
sash and then the cords of her welltrained muscles stood out on her
rounded arms and with a long pull and a strong pull and a pull all
together she landed the major upon the rock And then she laughed
and then inconsistent as it may appear she became grave and at once
proceeded to scrape him off and rub him down with dried leaves with
ferntwigs with her handkerchief with the border of her mantle as if
he were a child until he blushed with alternate shame and secret
satisfaction

They spoke but little on their return to the farmhouse for Mistress
Thankful had again become grave And yet the sun shone cheerily above
them the landscape was filled with the joy of resurrection and new and
awakened life the breeze whispered gentle promises of hope and the
fruition of their hopes in the summer to come And these two fared on
until they reached the porch with a halfpleased halffrightened
consciousness that they were not the same beings who had left it a
halfhour before

Nevertheless at the porch Mistress Thankful regained something of her
old audacity As they stood together in the hall she handed him back
the sash she had kept with her As she did so she could not help
saying There are some things worth stooping for Major Van Zandt

But she had not calculated upon the audacity of the man and as she
turned to fly she was caught by his strong arm and pinioned to his
side She struggled honestly I think and perhaps more frightened at
her own feelings than at his strength but it is to be recorded that he
kissed her in a moment of comparative yielding and then frightened
himself released her quickly whereat she fled to her room and threw
herself panting and troubled upon her bed For an hour or two she lay
there with flushed cheeks and conflicting thoughts He must never
kiss me again she said softly to herself unlessbut the
interrupting thought said I shall die if he kiss me not again and I
never can kiss another And then she was roused by a footstep upon
the stair which in that brief time she had learned to know and look
for and a knock at the door She opened it to Major Van Zandt white
and so colorless as to bring out once more the faint red line made by
her ridingwhip two days before as if it had risen again in
accusation The blood dropped out of her cheeks as she gazed at him in
silence

An escort of dragoons said Major Van Zandt slowly and with military
precision has just arrived bringing with them one Capt Allan
Brewster of the Connecticut Contingent on his way to Morristown to be
tried for mutiny and treason A private note from Col Hamilton
instructs me to allow him to have a private audience with youif YOU
so wish it

With a womans swift and too often hopeless intuition Thankful knew
that this was not the sole contents of the letter and that her
relations with Capt Brewster were known to the man before her But she
drew herself up a little proudly and turning her truthful eyes upon
the major said I DO so wish it

It shall be done as you desire Mistress Blossom returned the
officer with cold politeness as he turned upon his heel

One moment Major Van Zandt said Thankful swiftly

The major turned quickly but Thankfuls eyes were gazing thoughtfully
forward and scarcely glanced at him I would prefer she said
timidly and hesitatingly that this interview should not take place
under the roof wherewherewheremy father lives Halfway down the
meadow there is a barn and before it a broken part of the wall
fronting on a sycamoretree HE will know where it is Tell him I
will see him there in half an hour

A smile which the major had tried to make a careless one curled his
lip satirically as he bowed in reply It is the first time he said
dryly that I believe I have been honored with arranging a tryst for
two lovers but believe me Mistress Thankful I will do my best In
half an hour I will turn my prisoner over to you

In half an hour the punctual Mistress Thankful with a hood hiding her
pale face passed the officer in the hall on the way to her
rendezvous An hour later Caesar came with a message that Mistress
Thankful would like to see him When the major entered the
sittingroom he was shocked to find her lying pale and motionless on
the sofa but as the door closed she rose to her feet and confronted
him

I do not know she said slowly whether you are aware that the man I
just now parted from was for a twelvemonth past my sweetheart and that
I believed I loved him and KNEW I was true to him If you have not
heard it I tell you now for the time will come when you will hear
part of it from the lips of others and I would rather you should take
the whole truth from mine This man was false to me He betrayed two
friends of mine as spies I could have forgiven it had it been only
foolish jealousy but it was I have since learned from his own lips
only that he might gratify his spite against the commanderinchief by
procuring their arrest and making a serious difficulty in the American
camp by means of which he hoped to serve his own ends He told me
this believing that I sympathized with him in his hatred of the
commanderinchief and in his own wrongs and sufferings I confess to
my shame Major Van Zandt that two days ago I did believe him and
that I looked upon you as a mere catchpoll or bailiff of the tyrant
That I found out how I was deceived when I saw the commanderinchief
you major who know him so well need not be told Nor was it
necessary for me to tell this man that he had deceived me for I felt
thatthatwasnottheonly reasonwhy I could no longer
returnhis love

She paused as the major approached her earnestly and waved him back
with her hand He reproached me bitterly with my want of feeling for
his misfortunes she went on again he recalled my past
protestations he showed me my loveletters and he told me that if I
were still his true sweetheart I ought to help him I told him if he
would never call me by that name again if he would give up all claim
to me if he would never speak write to me nor see me again if he
would hand me back my lettersI would help him She stopped the
blood rushed into her pale face You will remember major that I
accepted this mans love as a young foolish trustful girl but when I
made him this offerhehe accepted it

The dog said Major Van Zandt But in what way could you help this
double traitor

I HAVE helped him said Thankful quietly

But how said Major Van Zandt

By becoming a traitor myself she said turning upon him almost
fiercely Hear me While you were quietly pacing these halls while
your men were laughing and talking in the road Caesar was saddling my
white mare the fleetest in the country He led her to the lane below
That mare is now two miles away with Capt Brewster on her back Why
do you not start major Look at me I am a traitor and this is my
bribe and she drew a package of letters from her bosom and flung
them on the table

She had been prepared for an outbreak or exclamation from the man
before her but not for his cold silence Speak she cried at last
passionately Speak Open your lips if only to curse me Order in
your men to arrest me I will proclaim myself guilty and save your
honor But only speak

May I ask said Major Van Zandt coldly why you have twice honored
me with a blow

Because I loved you because when I first saw you I saw the only man
that was my master and I rebelled because when I found I could not
help but love you I knew I never had loved before and I would wipe
out with one stroke all the past that rose in judgment against me
because I would not have you ever confronted with one endearing word of
mine that was not meant for you

Major Van Zandt turned from the window where he had stood and faced
the girl with sad resignation If I have in my foolishness Mistress
Thankful shown you how great was your power over me when you
descended to this artifice to spare my feelings by confessing your own
love for me you should have remembered that you were doing that which
forever kept me from wooing or winning you If you had really loved me
your heart as a womans would have warned you against that which my
heart as a gentlemans has made a law of honor when I tell you as
much for the sake of relieving your own conscience as for the sake of
justifying mine that if this man a traitor my prisoner and your
recognized lover had escaped from my custody without your assistance
connivance or even knowledge I should have deemed it my duty to
forsake you until I caught him even if we had been standing before the
altar

Thankful heard him but only as a strange voice in the distance as she
stood with fixed eyes and breathless parted lips before him Yet even
then I fear that womanlike she did not comprehend his rhetoric of
honor but only caught here and there a dull benumbing idea that he
despised her and that in her effort to win his love she had killed it
and ruined him forever

If you think it strange continued the major that believing as I
do I stand here only to utter moral axioms when my duty calls me to
pursue your lover I beg you to believe that it is only for your sake
I wish to allow a reasonable time between your interview with him and
his escape that shall save you from any suspicion of complicity Do
not think he added with a sad smile as the girl made an impatient
step toward him do not think I am running any risk The man cannot
escape A cordon of pickets surrounds the camp for many miles He has
not the countersign and his face and crime are known

Yes said Thankful eagerly but a part of his own regiment guards
the Baskingridge road

How know you this said the major seizing her hand

He told me

Before she could fall on her knees and beg his forgiveness he had
darted from the room given an order and returned with cheeks and eyes
blazing

Hear me he said rapidly taking the girls two hands you know not
what youve done I forgive you But this is no longer a matter of
duty but my personal honor I shall pursue this man alone I shall
return with him or not at all Farewell God bless you

But before he reached the door she caught him again Only say you
have forgiven me once more

I do

Guert

There was something in the girls voice more than this first utterance
of his Christian name that made him pause

I toldaliejustnow There is a fleeter horse in the stable
than my mare tis the roan filly in the second stall

God bless you

He was gone She waited to hear the clatter of his horses hoofs in
the roadway When Caesar came in a few moments later to tell the news
of Capt Brewsters escape the room was empty but it was soon filled
again by a dozen turbulent troopers

Of course shes gone said Sergeant Tibbitts the jade flew with the
captain

Ay tis plain enough Two horses are gone from the stable besides
the majors said Private Hicks

Nor was this military criticism entirely a private one When the
courier arrived at headquarters the next morning it was to bring the
report that Mistress Thankful Blossom after assisting her lover to
escape had fled with him The renegade is well off our hands said
Gen Sullivan gruffly he has saved us the public disgrace of a trial
But this is bad news of Major Van Zandt

What news of the major asked Washington quickly

He pursued the vagabond as far as Springfield killing his horse and
falling himself insensible before Major Mertons quarters Here he
became speedily delirious fever supervened and the regimental
surgeon after a careful examination pronounced his case one of
smallpox

A whisper of horror and pity went around the room Another gallant
soldier who should have died leading a charge laid by the heels by a
beggars filthy distemper growled Sullivan Where will it end

God knows said Hamilton Poor Van Zandt But whither was he
sentto the hospital

No a special permit was granted in his case and tis said he was
removed to the Blossom Farmit being remote from neighborsand the
house placed under quarantine Abner Blossom has prudently absented
himself from the chances of infection and the daughter has fled The
sick man is attended only by a black servant and an ancient crone so
that if the poor major escapes with his life or without disfigurement
pretty Mistress Bolton of Morristown need not be scandalized or
jealous



V

The ancient crone alluded to in the last chapter had been standing
behind the windowcurtains of that bedroom which had been Thankful
Blossoms in the weeks gone by She did not move her head but stood
looking demurely after the manner of ancient crones over the summer
landscape For the summer had come before the tardy spring was scarce
gone and the elms before the window no longer lisped but were
eloquent in the softest zephyrs There was the flash of birds in among
the bushes the occasional droning of bees in and out the open window
and a perpetually swinging censer of flower incense rising from below
The farm had put on its gayest bridal raiment and looking at the old
farmhouse shadowed with foliage and green with creeping vines it was
difficult to conceive that snow had ever lain on its porches or
icicles swung from its mossy eaves

Thankful said a voice still tremulous with weakness

The ancient crone turned drew aside the curtains and showed the sweet
face of Thankful Blossom more beautiful even in its paleness

Come here darling repeated the voice

Thankful stepped to the sofa whereon lay the convalescent Major Van
Zandt

Tell me sweetheart said the major taking her hand in his when
you married me as you told the chaplain that you might have the right
to nurse me did you never think that if death spared me I might be so
disfigured that even you dear love would have turned from me with
loathing

That was why I did it dear said Thankful mischievously I knew
that the pride and the sense of honor and selfdevotion of some
people would have kept them from keeping their promises to a poor
girl

But darling continued the major raising her hand to his lips
suppose the case had been reversed suppose you had taken the disease
that I had recovered without disfigurement but that this sweet face

I thought of that too interrupted Thankful Well what would you
have done dear said the major with his old mischievous smile

I should have died said Thankful gravely

But how

Somehow But you are to go to sleep and not ask impertinent and
frivolous questions for father is coming tomorrow

Thankful dear do you know what the trees and the birds said to me as
I lay there tossing with fever

No dear

Thankful Blossom Thankful Blossom Thankful Blossom is coming

Do you know what I said sweetheart as I lifted your dear head from
the ground when you reeled from your horse just as I overtook you at
Springfield

No dear

There are some things in life worth stooping for

And she winged this Parthian arrow home with a kiss
