By Laurence Sterne



two lines in Greek


To the Right Honourable Mr Pitt

Sir

Never poor Wight of a Dedicator had less hopes from his Dedication
than I have from this of mine for it is written in a bye corner of the
kingdom and in a retird thatchd house where I live in a constant
endeavour to fence against the infirmities of ill health and other
evils of life by mirth being firmly persuaded that every time a man
smilesbut much more so when he laughs it adds something to this
Fragment of Life

I humbly beg Sir that you will honour this book by taking itnot
under your Protectionit must protect itself butinto the country
with you where if I am ever told it has made you smile or can
conceive it has beguiled you of one moments painI shall think myself
as happy as a minister of stateperhaps much happier than any one one
only excepted that I have read or heard of

I am Great Sir and what is more to your Honour I am Good Sir Your
Wellwisher and most humble Fellowsubject

THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY GENTVOLUME THE FIRST



Chapter 1I

I wish either my father or my mother or indeed both of them as they
were in duty both equally bound to it had minded what they were about
when they begot me had they duly considerd how much depended upon what
they were then doingthat not only the production of a rational
Being was concerned in it but that possibly the happy formation and
temperature of his body perhaps his genius and the very cast of his
mindand for aught they knew to the contrary even the fortunes of
his whole house might take their turn from the humours and dispositions
which were then uppermostHad they duly weighed and considered all
this and proceeded accordinglyI am verily persuaded I should have
made a quite different figure in the world from that in which the
reader is likely to see meBelieve me good folks this is not so
inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think ityou have all I
dare say heard of the animal spirits as how they are transfused from
father to son c cand a great deal to that purposeWell you may
take my word that nine parts in ten of a mans sense or his nonsense
his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions
and activity and the different tracks and trains you put them into so
that when they are once set agoing whether right or wrong tis not
a halfpenny matteraway they go cluttering like heygo mad and by
treading the same steps over and over again they presently make a road
of it as plain and as smooth as a gardenwalk which when they are
once used to the Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive
them off it

Pray my Dear quoth my mother have you not forgot to wind up the
clockGood G cried my father making an exclamation but taking
care to moderate his voice at the same timeDid ever woman since the
creation of the world interrupt a man with such a silly question Pray
what was your father sayingNothing



Chapter 1II

Then positively there is nothing in the question that I can
see either good or badThen let me tell you Sir it was a very
unseasonable question at leastbecause it scattered and dispersed the
animal spirits whose business it was to have escorted and gone hand in
hand with the Homunculus and conducted him safe to the place destined
for his reception

The Homunculus Sir in however low and ludicrous a light he may appear
in this age of levity to the eye of folly or prejudiceto the eye of
reason in scientific research he stands confessda Being guarded and
circumscribed with rightsThe minutest philosophers who by the bye
have the most enlarged understandings their souls being inversely as
their enquiries shew us incontestably that the Homunculus is created
by the same handengenderd in the same course of natureendowd
with the same locomotive powers and faculties with usThat he
consists as we do of skin hair fat flesh veins arteries
ligaments nerves cartilages bones marrow brains glands genitals
humours and articulationsis a Being of as much activityand in all
senses of the word as much and as truly our fellowcreature as my Lord
Chancellor of EnglandHe may be benefittedhe may be injuredhe
may obtain redress in a word he has all the claims and rights of
humanity which Tully Puffendorf or the best ethick writers allow to
arise out of that state and relation

Now dear Sir what if any accident had befallen him in his way
aloneor that through terror of it natural to so young a traveller
my little Gentleman had got to his journeys end miserably spenthis
muscular strength and virility worn down to a threadhis own animal
spirits ruffled beyond descriptionand that in this sad disorderd
state of nerves he had lain down a prey to sudden starts or a
series of melancholy dreams and fancies for nine long long months
togetherI tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for
a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind which no skill of the
physician or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set thoroughly
to rights



Chapter 1III

To my uncle Mr Toby Shandy do I stand indebted for the preceding
anecdote to whom my father who was an excellent natural philosopher
and much given to close reasoning upon the smallest matters had oft
and heavily complained of the injury but once more particularly as
my uncle Toby well rememberd upon his observing a most unaccountable
obliquity as he calld it in my manner of setting up my top and
justifying the principles upon which I had done itthe old gentleman
shook his head and in a tone more expressive by half of sorrow than
reproachhe said his heart all along foreboded and he saw it verified
in this and from a thousand other observations he had made upon me
That I should neither think nor act like any other mans childBut
alas continued he shaking his head a second time and wiping away
a tear which was trickling down his cheeks My Tristrams misfortunes
began nine months before ever he came into the world

My mother who was sitting by lookd up but she knew no more than
her backside what my father meantbut my uncle Mr Toby Shandy who
had been often informed of the affairunderstood him very well



Chapter 1IV

I know there are readers in the world as well as many other good people
in it who are no readers at allwho find themselves ill at ease
unless they are let into the whole secret from first to last of every
thing which concerns you

It is in pure compliance with this humour of theirs and from a
backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living that I have
been so very particular already As my life and opinions are likely to
make some noise in the world and if I conjecture right will take in
all ranks professions and denominations of men whateverbe no less
read than the Pilgrims Progress itselfand in the end prove the very
thing which Montaigne dreaded his Essays should turn out that is a
book for a parlourwindowI find it necessary to consult every one a
little in his turn and therefore must beg pardon for going on a little
farther in the same way For which cause right glad I am that I have
begun the history of myself in the way I have done and that I am able
to go on tracing every thing in it as Horace says ab Ovo

Horace I know does not recommend this fashion altogether But that
gentleman is speaking only of an epic poem or a tragedyI
forget which besides if it was not so I should beg Mr Horaces
pardonfor in writing what I have set about I shall confine myself
neither to his rules nor to any mans rules that ever lived

To such however as do not choose to go so far back into these things I
can give no better advice than that they skip over the remaining part of
this chapter for I declare beforehand tis wrote only for the curious
and inquisitive

Shut the door

I was begot in the night betwixt the first Sunday and the first Monday
in the month of March in the year of our Lord one thousand seven
hundred and eighteen I am positive I wasBut how I came to be so very
particular in my account of a thing which happened before I was born
is owing to another small anecdote known only in our own family but now
made publick for the better clearing up this point

My father you must know who was originally a Turkey merchant but had
left off business for some years in order to retire to and die upon
his paternal estate in the county of  was I believe one of
the most regular men in every thing he did whether twas matter of
business or matter of amusement that ever lived As a small specimen
of this extreme exactness of his to which he was in truth a slave
he had made it a rule for many years of his lifeon the first
Sundaynight of every month throughout the whole yearas certain as
ever the Sundaynight cameto wind up a large houseclock which we
had standing on the backstairs head with his own handsAnd being
somewhere between fifty and sixty years of age at the time I have been
speaking ofhe had likewise gradually brought some other little family
concernments to the same period in order as he would often say to my
uncle Toby to get them all out of the way at one time and be no more
plagued and pestered with them the rest of the month

It was attended but with one misfortune which in a great measure fell
upon myself and the effects of which I fear I shall carry with me to my
grave namely that from an unhappy association of ideas which have
no connection in nature it so fell out at length that my poor mother
could never hear the said clock wound upbut the thoughts of some
other things unavoidably popped into her head vice versaWhich
strange combination of ideas the sagacious Locke who certainly
understood the nature of these things better than most men affirms
to have produced more wry actions than all other sources of prejudice
whatsoever

But this by the bye

Now it appears by a memorandum in my fathers pocketbook which now
lies upon the table That on Ladyday which was on the 25th of the
same month in which I date my genituremy father set upon his journey
to London with my eldest brother Bobby to fix him at Westminster
school and as it appears from the same authority That he did
not get down to his wife and family till the second week in May
followingit brings the thing almost to a certainty However
what follows in the beginning of the next chapter puts it beyond all
possibility of a doubt

But pray Sir What was your father doing all December January and
FebruaryWhy Madamhe was all that time afflicted with a Sciatica



Chapter 1V

On the fifth day of November 1718 which to the aera fixed on was
as near nine kalendar months as any husband could in reason have
expectedwas I Tristram Shandy Gentleman brought forth into this
scurvy and disastrous world of oursI wish I had been born in the
Moon or in any of the planets except Jupiter or Saturn because I
never could bear cold weather for it could not well have fared worse
with me in any of them though I will not answer for Venus than it
has in this vile dirty planet of ourswhich o my conscience with
reverence be it spoken I take to be made up of the shreds and clippings
of the restnot but the planet is well enough provided a man could
be born in it to a great title or to a great estate or could any how
contrive to be called up to public charges and employments of dignity
or powerbut that is not my caseand therefore every man will speak
of the fair as his own market has gone in itfor which cause I affirm
it over again to be one of the vilest worlds that ever was madefor I
can truly say that from the first hour I drew my breath in it to this
that I can now scarce draw it at all for an asthma I got in scating
against the wind in FlandersI have been the continual sport of what
the world calls Fortune and though I will not wrong her by saying She
has ever made me feel the weight of any great or signal evilyet with
all the good temper in the world I affirm it of her that in every stage
of my life and at every turn and corner where she could get fairly
at me the ungracious duchess has pelted me with a set of as pitiful
misadventures and cross accidents as ever small Hero sustained



Chapter 1VI

In the beginning of the last chapter I informed you exactly when I was
born but I did not inform you how No that particular was reserved
entirely for a chapter by itselfbesides Sir as you and I are in a
manner perfect strangers to each other it would not have been proper to
have let you into too many circumstances relating to myself all at once

You must have a little patience I have undertaken you see to write
not only my life but my opinions also hoping and expecting that your
knowledge of my character and of what kind of a mortal I am by the
one would give you a better relish for the other As you proceed
farther with me the slight acquaintance which is now beginning betwixt
us will grow into familiarity and that unless one of us is in fault
will terminate in friendshipO diem praeclarumthen nothing which
has touched me will be thought trifling in its nature or tedious in its
telling Therefore my dear friend and companion if you should think
me somewhat sparing of my narrative on my first setting outbear with
meand let me go on and tell my story my own wayOr if I should
seem now and then to trifle upon the roador should sometimes put on
a fools cap with a bell to it for a moment or two as we pass
alongdont fly offbut rather courteously give me credit for a
little more wisdom than appears upon my outsideand as we jog on
either laugh with me or at me or in short do any thingonly keep
your temper



Chapter 1VII

In the same village where my father and my mother dwelt dwelt also a
thin upright motherly notable good old body of a midwife who with
the help of a little plain good sense and some years full employment
in her business in which she had all along trusted little to her own
efforts and a great deal to those of dame Naturehad acquired in her
way no small degree of reputation in the worldby which word world
need I in this place inform your worship that I would be understood to
mean no more of it than a small circle described upon the circle of the
great world of four English miles diameter or thereabouts of which
the cottage where the good old woman lived is supposed to be the
centreShe had been left it seems a widow in great distress with
three or four small children in her fortyseventh year and as she was
at that time a person of decent carriagegrave deportmenta
woman moreover of few words and withal an object of compassion whose
distress and silence under it called out the louder for a friendly
lift the wife of the parson of the parish was touched with pity and
having often lamented an inconvenience to which her husbands flock had
for many years been exposed inasmuch as there was no such thing as a
midwife of any kind or degree to be got at let the case have been
never so urgent within less than six or seven long miles riding which
said seven long miles in dark nights and dismal roads the country
thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay was almost equal to fourteen
and that in effect was sometimes next to having no midwife at all it
came into her head that it would be doing as seasonable a kindness to
the whole parish as to the poor creature herself to get her a little
instructed in some of the plain principles of the business in order
to set her up in it As no woman thereabouts was better qualified to
execute the plan she had formed than herself the gentlewoman very
charitably undertook it and having great influence over the female part
of the parish she found no difficulty in effecting it to the utmost of
her wishes In truth the parson joind his interest with his wifes in
the whole affair and in order to do things as they should be and give
the poor soul as good a title by law to practise as his wife had given
by institutionhe cheerfully paid the fees for the ordinarys licence
himself amounting in the whole to the sum of eighteen shillings and
four pence so that betwixt them both the good woman was fully invested
in the real and corporal possession of her office together with all its
rights members and appurtenances whatsoever

These last words you must know were not according to the old form in
which such licences faculties and powers usually ran which in
like cases had heretofore been granted to the sisterhood But it was
according to a neat Formula of Didius his own devising who having a
particular turn for taking to pieces and new framing over again
all kind of instruments in that way not only hit upon this dainty
amendment but coaxed many of the old licensed matrons in the
neighbourhood to open their faculties afresh in order to have this
whamwham of his inserted

I own I never could envy Didius in these kinds of fancies of hisBut
every man to his own tasteDid not Dr Kunastrokius that great man
at his leisure hours take the greatest delight imaginable in combing of
asses tails and plucking the dead hairs out with his teeth though he
had tweezers always in his pocket Nay if you come to that Sir have
not the wisest of men in all ages not excepting Solomon himselfhave
they not had their HobbyHorsestheir running horsestheir coins
and their cockleshells their drums and their trumpets their fiddles
their palletstheir maggots and their butterfliesand so long as
a man rides his HobbyHorse peaceably and quietly along the Kings
highway and neither compels you or me to get up behind himpray Sir
what have either you or I to do with it



Chapter 1VIII

De gustibus non est disputandumthat is there is no disputing
against HobbyHorses and for my part I seldom do nor could I with any
sort of grace had I been an enemy to them at the bottom for happening
at certain intervals and changes of the moon to be both fidler and
painter according as the fly stingsBe it known to you that I keep
a couple of pads myself upon which in their turns nor do I care who
knows it I frequently ride out and take the airthough sometimes to
my shame be it spoken I take somewhat longer journies than what a wise
man would think altogether rightBut the truth isI am not a wise
manand besides am a mortal of so little consequence in the world it
is not much matter what I do so I seldom fret or fume at all about it
Nor does it much disturb my rest when I see such great Lords and tall
Personages as hereafter followsuch for instance as my Lord A B C
D E F G H I K L M N O P Q and so on all of a row mounted
upon their several horsessome with large stirrups getting on in a
more grave and sober paceothers on the contrary tucked up to their
very chins with whips across their mouths scouring and scampering it
away like so many little partycoloured devils astride a mortgageand
as if some of them were resolved to break their necksSo much the
bettersay I to myselffor in case the worst should happen the
world will make a shift to do excellently well without them and for
the restwhyGod speed themeen let them ride on without opposition
from me for were their lordships unhorsed this very nighttis ten
to one but that many of them would be worse mounted by one half before
tomorrow morning

Not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in upon my
restBut there is an instance which I own puts me off my guard and
that is when I see one born for great actions and what is still more
for his honour whose nature ever inclines him to good oneswhen I
behold such a one my Lord like yourself whose principles and conduct
are as generous and noble as his blood and whom for that reason a
corrupt world cannot spare one momentwhen I see such a one my Lord
mounted though it is but for a minute beyond the time which my love
to my country has prescribed to him and my zeal for his glory
wishesthen my Lord I cease to be a philosopher and in the first
transport of an honest impatience I wish the HobbyHorse with all his
fraternity at the Devil



My Lord I maintain this to be a dedication notwithstanding its
singularity in the three great essentials of matter form and place I
beg therefore you will accept it as such and that you will permit
me to lay it with the most respectful humility at your Lordships
feetwhen you are upon themwhich you can be when you pleaseand
that is my Lord whenever there is occasion for it and I will add to
the best purposes too I have the honour to be

 My Lord
 Your Lordships most obedient
 and most devoted
 and most humble servant
 Tristram Shandy



Chapter 1IX

I solemnly declare to all mankind that the above dedication was made
for no one Prince Prelate Pope or PotentateDuke Marquis Earl
Viscount or Baron of this or any other Realm in Christendomnor has
it yet been hawked about or offered publicly or privately directly
or indirectly to any one person or personage great or small but is
honestly a true VirginDedication untried on upon any soul living

I labour this point so particularly merely to remove any offence
or objection which might arise against it from the manner in which I
propose to make the most of itwhich is the putting it up fairly to
public sale which I now do

Every author has a way of his own in bringing his points to bearfor
my own part as I hate chaffering and higgling for a few guineas in a
dark entryI resolved within myself from the very beginning to
deal squarely and openly with your Great Folks in this affair and try
whether I should not come off the better by it

If therefore there is any one Duke Marquis Earl Viscount or Baron
in these his Majestys dominions who stands in need of a tight genteel
dedication and whom the above will suit for by the bye unless
it suits in some degree I will not part with itit is much at his
service for fifty guineaswhich I am positive is twenty guineas less
than it ought to be afforded for by any man of genius

My Lord if you examine it over again it is far from being a gross
piece of daubing as some dedications are The design your Lordship
sees is goodthe colouring transparentthe drawing not amissor
to speak more like a man of scienceand measure my piece in the
painters scale divided into 20I believe my Lord the outlines
will turn out as 12the composition as 9the colouring as 6the
expression 13 and a halfand the designif I may be allowed my
Lord to understand my own design and supposing absolute perfection
in designing to be as 20I think it cannot well fall short of 19
Besides all thisthere is keeping in it and the dark strokes in the
HobbyHorse which is a secondary figure and a kind of background to
the whole give great force to the principal lights in your own figure
and make it come off wonderfullyand besides there is an air of
originality in the tout ensemble

Be pleased my good Lord to order the sum to be paid into the hands of
Mr Dodsley for the benefit of the author and in the next edition
care shall be taken that this chapter be expunged and your Lordships
titles distinctions arms and good actions be placed at the front of
the preceding chapter All which from the words De gustibus non est
disputandum and whatever else in this book relates to HobbyHorses but
no more shall stand dedicated to your LordshipThe rest I dedicate to
the Moon who by the bye of all the Patrons or Matrons I can think of
has most power to set my book agoing and make the world run mad after
it

Bright Goddess If thou art not too busy with Candid and Miss Cunegunds
affairstake Tristram Shandys under thy protection also



Chapter 1X

Whatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favour of the
midwife might justly claim or in whom that claim truly restedat
first sight seems not very material to this historycertain however it
was that the gentlewoman the parsons wife did run away at that time
with the whole of it And yet for my life I cannot help thinking but
that the parson himself though he had not the good fortune to hit upon
the design firstyet as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was
laid before him and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into
execution had a claim to some share of itif not to a full half of
whatever honour was due to it

The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter otherwise

Lay down the book and I will allow you half a day to give a probable
guess at the grounds of this procedure

Be it known then that for about five years before the date of
the midwifes licence of which you have had so circumstantial an
accountthe parson we have to do with had made himself a countrytalk
by a breach of all decorum which he had committed against himself his
station and his officeand that was in never appearing better or
otherwise mounted than upon a lean sorry jackass of a horse value
about one pound fifteen shillings who to shorten all description of
him was full brother to Rosinante as far as similitude congenial could
make him for he answered his description to a hairbreadth in every
thingexcept that I do not remember tis any where said that
Rosinante was brokenwinded and that moreover Rosinante as is the
happiness of most Spanish horses fat or leanwas undoubtedly a horse
at all points

I know very well that the Heros horse was a horse of chaste deportment
which may have given grounds for the contrary opinion But it is
as certain at the same time that Rosinantes continency as may be
demonstrated from the adventure of the Yanguesian carriers proceeded
from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever but from the temperance and
orderly current of his bloodAnd let me tell you Madam there is a
great deal of very good chastity in the world in behalf of which you
could not say more for your life

Let that be as it may as my purpose is to do exact justice to every
creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic workI could not
stifle this distinction in favour of Don Quixotes horsein all other
points the parsons horse I say was just such another for he was as
lean and as lank and as sorry a jade as Humility herself could have
bestrided

In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment it was
greatly in the parsons power to have helped the figure of this horse of
hisfor he was master of a very handsome demipeaked saddle
quilted on the seat with green plush garnished with a double row of
silverheaded studs and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups with a
housing altogether suitable of grey superfine cloth with an edging of
black lace terminating in a deep black silk fringe poudre dorall
which he had purchased in the pride and prime of his life together with
a grand embossed bridle ornamented at all points as it should beBut
not caring to banter his beast he had hung all these up behind his
study door and in lieu of them had seriously befitted him with just
such a bridle and such a saddle as the figure and value of such a steed
might well and truly deserve

In the several sallies about his parish and in the neighbouring visits
to the gentry who lived around himyou will easily comprehend that
the parson so appointed would both hear and see enough to keep his
philosophy from rusting To speak the truth he never could enter a
village but he caught the attention of both old and youngLabour
stood still as he passdthe bucket hung suspended in the middle of
the wellthe spinningwheel forgot its roundeven chuckfarthing and
shufflecap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight and as
his movement was not of the quickest he had generally time enough
upon his hands to make his observationsto hear the groans of the
seriousand the laughter of the lighthearted all which he bore with
excellent tranquillityHis character washe loved a jest in his
heartand as he saw himself in the true point of ridicule he would say
he could not be angry with others for seeing him in a light in which he
so strongly saw himself So that to his friends who knew his foible
was not the love of money and who therefore made the less scruple in
bantering the extravagance of his humourinstead of giving the true
causehe chose rather to join in the laugh against himself and as
he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own bones being
altogether as spare a figure as his beasthe would sometimes insist
upon it that the horse was as good as the rider deservedthat they
were centaurlikeboth of a piece At other times and in other
moods when his spirits were above the temptation of false withe
would say he found himself going off fast in a consumption and with
great gravity would pretend he could not bear the sight of a fat
horse without a dejection of heart and a sensible alteration in his
pulse and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon not
only to keep himself in countenance but in spirits

At different times he would give fifty humorous and apposite reasons for
riding a meekspirited jade of a brokenwinded horse preferably to one
of mettlefor on such a one he could sit mechanically and meditate as
delightfully de vanitate mundi et fuga faeculi as with the advantage of
a deathshead before himthat in all other exercitations he could
spend his time as he rode slowly alongto as much account as in his
studythat he could draw up an argument in his sermonor a hole
in his breeches as steadily on the one as in the otherthat brisk
trotting and slow argumentation like wit and judgment were two
incompatible movementsBut that upon his steedhe could unite and
reconcile every thinghe could compose his sermonhe could compose
his coughand in case nature gave a call that way he could likewise
compose himself to sleepIn short the parson upon such encounters
would assign any cause but the true causeand he withheld the true
one only out of a nicety of temper because he thought it did honour to
him

But the truth of the story was as follows In the first years of this
gentlemans life and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle
were purchased by him it had been his manner or vanity or call it
what you willto run into the opposite extremeIn the language of
the county where he dwelt he was said to have loved a good horse and
generally had one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable
always ready for saddling and as the nearest midwife as I told you
did not live nearer to the village than seven miles and in a vile
countryit so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week
together without some piteous application for his beast and as he was
not an unkindhearted man and every case was more pressing and more
distressful than the lastas much as he loved his beast he had never
a heart to refuse him the upshot of which was generally this that
his horse was either clappd or spavind or greazdor he was
twitterbond or brokenwinded or something in short or other had
befallen him which would let him carry no fleshso that he had every
nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid ofand a good horse to
purchase in his stead

What the loss in such a balance might amount to communibus annis I
would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick to
determinebut let it be what it would the honest gentleman bore
it for many years without a murmur till at length by repeated ill
accidents of the kind he found it necessary to take the thing under
consideration and upon weighing the whole and summing it up in his
mind he found it not only disproportioned to his other expences but
withal so heavy an article in itself as to disable him from any other
act of generosity in his parish Besides this he considered that
with half the sum thus galloped away he could do ten times as
much goodand what still weighed more with him than all other
considerations put together was this that it confined all his charity
into one particular channel and where as he fancied it was the least
wanted namely to the childbearing and childgetting part of
his parish reserving nothing for the impotentnothing for the
agednothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called
forth to visit where poverty and sickness and affliction dwelt
together

For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence and there
appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of itand
these were either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his
steed upon any application whateveror else be content to ride the
last poor devil such as they had made him with all his aches and
infirmities to the very end of the chapter

As he dreaded his own constancy in the firsthe very chearfully betook
himself to the second and though he could very well have explained it
as I said to his honouryet for that very reason he had a spirit
above it choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies and the
laughter of his friends than undergo the pain of telling a story which
might seem a panegyrick upon himself

I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this
reverend gentleman from this single stroke in his character which I
think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight
of La Mancha whom by the bye with all his follies I love more
and would actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to than the
greatest hero of antiquity

But this is not the moral of my story The thing I had in view was to
shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affairFor you
must know that so long as this explanation would have done the parson
creditthe devil a soul could find it outI suppose his enemies
would not and that his friends could notBut no sooner did he bestir
himself in behalf of the midwife and pay the expences of the ordinarys
licence to set her upbut the whole secret came out every horse
he had lost and two horses more than ever he had lost with all
the circumstances of their destruction were known and distinctly
rememberedThe story ran like wildfireThe parson had a returning
fit of pride which had just seized him and he was going to be well
mounted once again in his life and if it was so twas plain as the sun
at noonday he would pocket the expence of the licence ten times told
the very first yearSo that every body was left to judge what were his
views in this act of charity

What were his views in this and in every other action of his lifeor
rather what were the opinions which floated in the brains of other
people concerning it was a thought which too much floated in his own
and too often broke in upon his rest when he should have been sound
asleep

About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made
entirely easy upon that scoreit being just so long since he left his
parishand the whole world at the same time behind himand stands
accountable to a Judge of whom he will have no cause to complain

But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men Order them
as they will they pass thro a certain medium which so twists and
refracts them from their true directionsthat with all the titles
to praise which a rectitude of heart can give the doers of them are
nevertheless forced to live and die without it

Of the truth of which this gentleman was a painful exampleBut to
know by what means this came to passand to make that knowledge of use
to you I insist upon it that you read the two following chapters which
contain such a sketch of his life and conversation as will carry its
moral along with itWhen this is done if nothing stops us in our way
we will go on with the midwife



Chapter 1XI

Yorick was this parsons name and what is very remarkable in it as
appears from a most ancient account of the family wrote upon strong
vellum and now in perfect preservation it had been exactly so spelt
for nearI was within an ace of saying nine hundred yearsbut
I would not shake my credit in telling an improbable truth however
indisputable in itselfand therefore I shall content myself with only
sayingIt had been exactly so spelt without the least variation or
transposition of a single letter for I do not know how long which is
more than I would venture to say of one half of the best surnames in the
kingdom which in a course of years have generally undergone as many
chops and changes as their ownersHas this been owing to the pride
or to the shame of the respective proprietorsIn honest truth I think
sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other just as the temptation
has wrought But a villainous affair it is and will one day so blend
and confound us all together that no one shall be able to stand up and
swear That his own great grandfather was the man who did either this
or that

This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of
the Yoricks family and their religious preservation of these records
I quote which do farther inform us That the family was originally of
Danish extraction and had been transplanted into England as early as in
the reign of Horwendillus king of Denmark in whose court it seems an
ancestor of this Mr Yoricks and from whom he was lineally descended
held a considerable post to the day of his death Of what nature this
considerable post was this record saith notit only adds That
for near two centuries it had been totally abolished as altogether
unnecessary not only in that court but in every other court of the
Christian world

It has often come into my head that this post could be no other than
that of the kings chief Jesterand that Hamlets Yorick in
our Shakespeare many of whose plays you know are founded upon
authenticated facts was certainly the very man

I have not the time to look into SaxoGrammaticuss Danish history to
know the certainty of thisbut if you have leisure and can easily get
at the book you may do it full as well yourself

I had just time in my travels through Denmark with Mr Noddys eldest
son whom in the year 1741 I accompanied as governor riding along
with him at a prodigious rate thro most parts of Europe and of which
original journey performed by us two a most delectable narrative will
be given in the progress of this work I had just time I say and that
was all to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner
in that countrynamely That nature was neither very lavish nor
was she very stingy in her gifts of genius and capacity to its
inhabitantsbut like a discreet parent was moderately kind to them
all observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favours
as to bring them in those points pretty near to a level with each
other so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of
refined parts but a great deal of good plain houshold understanding
amongst all ranks of people of which every body has a share which is
I think very right

With us you see the case is quite differentwe are all ups and downs
in this matteryou are a great geniusor tis fifty to one Sir you
are a great dunce and a blockheadnot that there is a total want of
intermediate stepsnowe are not so irregular as that comes tobut
the two extremes are more common and in a greater degree in this
unsettled island where nature in her gifts and dispositions of this
kind is most whimsical and capricious fortune herself not being more
so in the bequest of her goods and chattels than she

This is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to Yoricks
extraction who by what I can remember of him and by all the accounts
I could ever get of him seemed not to have had one single drop of
Danish blood in his whole crasis in nine hundred years it might
possibly have all run outI will not philosophize one moment with you
about it for happen how it would the fact was thisThat instead of
that cold phlegm and exact regularity of sense and humours you would
have looked for in one so extractedhe was on the contrary as
mercurial and sublimated a compositionas heteroclite a creature in
all his declensionswith as much life and whim and gaite de coeur
about him as the kindliest climate could have engendered and put
together With all this sail poor Yorick carried not one ounce of
ballast he was utterly unpractised in the world and at the age of
twentysix knew just about as well how to steer his course in it as a
romping unsuspicious girl of thirteen So that upon his first setting
out the brisk gale of his spirits as you will imagine ran him foul
ten times in a day of somebodys tackling and as the grave and more
slowpaced were oftenest in his wayyou may likewise imagine twas
with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled For
aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of
such FracasFor to speak the truth Yorick had an invincible dislike
and opposition in his nature to gravitynot to gravity as suchfor
where gravity was wanted he would be the most grave or serious of
mortal men for days and weeks togetherbut he was an enemy to the
affectation of it and declared open war against it only as it appeared
a cloak for ignorance or for folly and then whenever it fell in his
way however sheltered and protected he seldom gave it much quarter

Sometimes in his wild way of talking he would say that Gravity was
an errant scoundrel and he would addof the most dangerous kind
toobecause a sly one and that he verily believed more honest
wellmeaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in
one twelvemonth than by pocketpicking and shoplifting in seven In
the naked temper which a merry heart discovered he would say there
was no dangerbut to itselfwhereas the very essence of gravity was
design and consequently deceittwas a taught trick to gain credit of
the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth and that
with all its pretensionsit was no better but often worse than what
a French wit had long ago defined itviz A mysterious carriage
of the body to cover the defects of the mindwhich definition of
gravity Yorick with great imprudence would say deserved to be wrote
in letters of gold

But in plain truth he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the
world and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other
subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint Yorick
had no impression but one and that was what arose from the nature of
the deed spoken of which impression he would usually translate into
plain English without any periphrasisand too oft without much
distinction of either person time or placeso that when mention was
made of a pitiful or an ungenerous proceedinghe never gave himself
a moments time to reflect who was the hero of the piecewhat his
stationor how far he had power to hurt him hereafterbut if it was
a dirty actionwithout more adoThe man was a dirty fellowand
so onAnd as his comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated
either in a bon mot or to be enlivened throughout with some drollery or
humour of expression it gave wings to Yoricks indiscretion In a
word tho he never sought yet at the same time as he seldom shunned
occasions of saying what came uppermost and without much ceremonyhe
had but too many temptations in life of scattering his wit and his
humourhis gibes and his jests about himThey were not lost for want
of gathering

What were the consequences and what was Yoricks catastrophe thereupon
you will read in the next chapter



Chapter 1XII

The Mortgager and Mortgagee differ the one from the other not more in
length of purse than the Jester and Jestee do in that of memory But
in this the comparison between them runs as the scholiasts call it
upon allfour which by the bye is upon one or two legs more than some
of the best of Homers can pretend tonamely That the one raises a
sum and the other a laugh at your expence and thinks no more about
it Interest however still runs on in both casesthe periodical or
accidental payments of it just serving to keep the memory of the affair
alive till at length in some evil hour pop comes the creditor upon
each and by demanding principal upon the spot together with full
interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their
obligations

As the reader for I hate your ifs has a thorough knowledge of human
nature I need not say more to satisfy him that my Hero could not go
on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental
mementos To speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a
multitude of small bookdebts of this stamp which notwithstanding
Eugeniuss frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that
as not one of them was contracted thro any malignancybut on the
contrary from an honesty of mind and a mere jocundity of humour they
would all of them be crossd out in course

Eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him that one day
or other he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add
in an accent of sorrowful apprehensionto the uttermost mite To which
Yorick with his usual carelessness of heart would as often answer with
a pshawand if the subject was started in the fieldswith a hop
skip and a jump at the end of it but if close pent up in the social
chimneycorner where the culprit was barricadod in with a table and
a couple of armchairs and could not so readily fly off in a
tangentEugenius would then go on with his lecture upon discretion in
words to this purpose though somewhat better put together

Trust me dear Yorick this unwary pleasantry of thine will sooner or
later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties which no afterwit can
extricate thee out ofIn these sallies too oft I see it happens
that a person laughed at considers himself in the light of a person
injured with all the rights of such a situation belonging to him and
when thou viewest him in that light too and reckons up his friends
his family his kindred and alliesand musters up with them the many
recruits which will list under him from a sense of common dangertis
no extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokesthou hast
got an hundred enemies and till thou hast gone on and raised a swarm
of wasps about thine ears and art half stung to death by them thou
wilt never be convinced it is so

I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem that there is the least
spur from spleen or malevolence of intent in these salliesI believe
and know them to be truly honest and sportiveBut consider my dear
lad that fools cannot distinguish thisand that knaves will not and
thou knowest not what it is either to provoke the one or to make merry
with the otherwhenever they associate for mutual defence depend upon
it they will carry on the war in such a manner against thee my dear
friend as to make thee heartily sick of it and of thy life too

Revenge from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour at
thee which no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall set
rightThe fortunes of thy house shall totterthy character which
led the way to them shall bleed on every side of itthy faith
questionedthy works beliedthy wit forgottenthy learning
trampled on To wind up the last scene of thy tragedy Cruelty and
Cowardice twin ruffians hired and set on by Malice in the dark shall
strike together at all thy infirmities and mistakesThe best of us
my dear lad lie open thereand trust metrust me Yorick when to
gratify a private appetite it is once resolved upon that an innocent
and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed tis an easy matter to
pick up sticks enough from any thicket where it has strayed to make a
fire to offer it up with

Yorick scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over
to him but with a tear stealing from his eye and a promissory look
attending it that he was resolved for the time to come to ride his
tit with more sobrietyBut alas too latea grand confederacy
withandat the head of it was formed before the first prediction
of itThe whole plan of the attack just as Eugenius had foreboded
was put in execution all at oncewith so little mercy on the side of
the alliesand so little suspicion in Yorick of what was carrying
on against himthat when he thought good easy man full surely
preferment was oripeningthey had smote his root and then he fell
as many a worthy man had fallen before him

Yorick however fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some
time till overpowered by numbers and worn out at length by the
calamities of the warbut more so by the ungenerous manner in which
it was carried onhe threw down the sword and though he kept up
his spirits in appearance to the last he died nevertheless as was
generally thought quite brokenhearted

What inclined Eugenius to the same opinion was as follows

A few hours before Yorick breathed his last Eugenius stept in with an
intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him Upon his drawing
Yoricks curtain and asking how he felt himself Yorick looking up in
his face took hold of his handand after thanking him for the many
tokens of his friendship to him for which he said if it was their
fate to meet hereafterhe would thank him again and againhe told
him he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for
everI hope not answered Eugenius with tears trickling down his
cheeks and with the tenderest tone that ever man spokeI hope not
Yorick said heYorick replied with a look up and a gentle squeeze
of Eugeniuss hand and that was allbut it cut Eugenius to his
heartComecome Yorick quoth Eugenius wiping his eyes and
summoning up the man within himmy dear lad be comfortedlet not
all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most
wants themwho knows what resources are in store and what the power
of God may yet do for theeYorick laid his hand upon his heart and
gently shook his headFor my part continued Eugenius crying bitterly
as he uttered the wordsI declare I know not Yorick how to part with
thee and would gladly flatter my hopes added Eugenius chearing up
his voice that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop
and that I may live to see itI beseech thee Eugenius quoth Yorick
taking off his nightcap as well as he could with his left handhis
right being still grasped close in that of EugeniusI beseech thee to
take a view of my headI see nothing that ails it replied Eugenius
Then alas my friend said Yorick let me tell you that tis so
bruised and misshapened with the blows whichand and some others
have so unhandsomely given me in the dark that I might say with Sancho
Panca that should I recover and Mitres thereupon be suffered to
rain down from heaven as thick as hail not one of them would fit
itYoricks last breath was hanging upon his trembling lips ready to
depart as he uttered thisyet still it was uttered with something of
a Cervantick toneand as he spoke it Eugenius could perceive a stream
of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his eyesfaint picture of
those flashes of his spirit which as Shakespeare said of his ancestor
were wont to set the table in a roar

Eugenius was convinced from this that the heart of his friend was
broke he squeezed his handand then walked softly out of the room
weeping as he walked Yorick followed Eugenius with his eyes to the
doorhe then closed them and never opened them more

He lies buried in the corner of his churchyard in the parish of
under a plain marble slab which his friend Eugenius by leave of his
executors laid upon his grave with no more than these three words of
inscription serving both for his epitaph and elegy Alas poor Yorick

Ten times a day has Yoricks ghost the consolation to hear his
monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones
as denote a general pity and esteem for hima footway crossing the
churchyard close by the side of his gravenot a passenger goes by
without stopping to cast a look upon itand sighing as he walks on
Alas poor Yorick



Chapter 1XIII

It is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been parted
from the midwife that it is high time to mention her again to him
merely to put him in mind that there is such a body still in the world
and whom upon the best judgment I can form upon my own plan at present
I am going to introduce to him for good and all But as fresh matter may
be started and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and
myself which may require immediate dispatchtwas right to take care
that the poor woman should not be lost in the mean timebecause when
she is wanted we can no way do without her

I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small note
and consequence throughout our whole village and townshipthat her
fame had spread itself to the very outedge and circumference of that
circle of importance of which kind every soul living whether he has a
shirt to his back or nohas one surrounding himwhich said circle
by the way whenever tis said that such a one is of great weight and
importance in the worldI desire may be enlarged or contracted in
your worships fancy in a compound ratio of the station profession
knowledge abilities height and depth measuring both ways of the
personage brought before you

In the present case if I remember I fixed it about four or five miles
which not only comprehended the whole parish but extended itself to two
or three of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of the next parish which
made a considerable thing of it I must add That she was moreover
very well looked on at one large grangehouse and some other odd houses
and farms within two or three miles as I said from the smoke of her
own chimneyBut I must here once for all inform you that all this
will be more exactly delineated and explaind in a map now in the hands
of the engraver which with many other pieces and developements of this
work will be added to the end of the twentieth volumenot to
swell the workI detest the thought of such a thingbut by way of
commentary scholium illustration and key to such passages incidents
or inuendos as shall be thought to be either of private interpretation
or of dark or doubtful meaning after my life and my opinions shall have
been read over now dont forget the meaning of the word by all
the worldwhich betwixt you and me and in spite of all the
gentlemenreviewers in Great Britain and of all that their worships
shall undertake to write or say to the contraryI am determined shall
be the caseI need not tell your worship that all this is spoke in
confidence



Chapter 1XIV

Upon looking into my mothers marriage settlement in order to satisfy
myself and reader in a point necessary to be cleared up before we could
proceed any farther in this historyI had the good fortune to pop
upon the very thing I wanted before I had read a day and a half straight
forwardsit might have taken me up a monthwhich shews plainly that
when a man sits down to write a historytho it be but the history of
Jack Hickathrift or Tom Thumb he knows no more than his heels what
lets and confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his wayor what
a dance he may be led by one excursion or another before all is over
Could a historiographer drive on his history as a muleteer drives on
his mulestraight forwardfor instance from Rome all the way to
Loretto without ever once turning his head aside either to the right
hand or to the lefthe might venture to foretell you to an hour when
he should get to his journeys endbut the thing is morally speaking
impossible For if he is a man of the least spirit he will have fifty
deviations from a straight line to make with this or that party as he
goes along which he can no ways avoid He will have views and prospects
to himself perpetually soliciting his eye which he can no more help
standing still to look at than he can fly he will moreover have various

 Accounts to reconcile
 Anecdotes to pick up
 Inscriptions to make out
 Stories to weave in
 Traditions to sift
 Personages to call upon
 Panegyricks to paste up at this door

Pasquinades at thatAll which both the man and his mule are quite
exempt from To sum up all there are archives at every stage to be
lookd into and rolls records documents and endless genealogies
which justice ever and anon calls him back to stay the reading ofIn
short there is no end of itfor my own part I declare I have been at
it these six weeks making all the speed I possibly couldand am not
yet bornI have just been able and thats all to tell you when it
happend but not howso that you see the thing is yet far from being
accomplished

These unforeseen stoppages which I own I had no conception of when I
first set outbut which I am convinced now will rather increase than
diminish as I advancehave struck out a hint which I am resolved to
followand that isnot to be in a hurrybut to go on leisurely
writing and publishing two volumes of my life every yearwhich if I
am suffered to go on quietly and can make a tolerable bargain with my
bookseller I shall continue to do as long as I live



Chapter 1XV

The article in my mothers marriagesettlement which I told the reader
I was at the pains to search for and which now that I have found it I

barbarity to take it out of the lawyers handIt is as follows

the advowson donation presentation and free disposition of the
rectory or parsonage of Shandy aforesaid and all and every the tenths
tythes glebelandsIn three wordsMy mother was to lay in if she
chose it in London

But in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on
the part of my mother which a marriagearticle of this nature too
manifestly opened a door to and which indeed had never been thought of
at all but for my uncle Toby Shandya clause was added in security of
my father which was thisThat in case my mother hereafter should at
any time put my father to the trouble and expence of a London journey
upon false cries and tokensthat for every such instance she should
forfeit all the right and title which the covenant gave her to the next
turnbut to no moreand so on toties quoties in as effectual a
manner as if such a covenant betwixt them had not been madeThis by
the way was no more than what was reasonableand yet as reasonable
as it was I have ever thought it hard that the whole weight of the
article should have fallen entirely as it did upon myself

But I was begot and born to misfortunesfor my poor mother whether
it was wind or wateror a compound of bothor neitheror whether it
was simply the mere swell of imagination and fancy in heror how far
a strong wish and desire to have it so might mislead her judgmentin
short whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter it no
way becomes me to decide The fact was this That in the latter end of
September 1717 which was the year before I was born my mother having
carried my father up to town much against the grainhe peremptorily
insisted upon the clauseso that I was doomd by marriagearticles
to have my nose squeezd as flat to my face as if the destinies had
actually spun me without one

How this event came aboutand what a train of vexatious
disappointments in one stage or other of my life have pursued me from
the mere loss or rather compression of this one single membershall
be laid before the reader all in due time



Chapter 1XVI

My father as any body may naturally imagine came down with my mother
into the country in but a pettish kind of a humour The first twenty
or fiveandtwenty miles he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze
himself and indeed my mother too about the cursed expence which he
said might every shilling of it have been savedthen what vexed him
more than every thing else was the provoking time of the yearwhich
as I told you was towards the end of September when his wallfruit and
green gages especially in which he was very curious were just ready
for pullingHad he been whistled up to London upon a Tom Fools
errand in any other month of the whole year he should not have said
three words about it

For the next two whole stages no subject would go down but the heavy
blow he had sustaind from the loss of a son whom it seems he had fully
reckond upon in his mind and registerd down in his pocketbook as
a second staff for his old age in case Bobby should fail him The
disappointment of this he said was ten times more to a wise man than
all the money which the journey c had cost him put togetherrot
the hundred and twenty poundshe did not mind it a rush

From Stilton all the way to Grantham nothing in the whole affair
provoked him so much as the condolences of his friends and the foolish
figure they should both make at church the first Sundayof which in
the satirical vehemence of his wit now sharpend a little by vexation
he would give so many humorous and provoking descriptionsand place
his rib and self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face
of the whole congregationthat my mother declared these two stages
were so truly tragicomical that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a
breath from one end to the other of them all the way

From Grantham till they had crossd the Trent my father was out of all
kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which he fancied my
mother had put upon him in this affairCertainly he would say
to himself over and over again the woman could not be deceived
herselfif she couldwhat weaknesstormenting wordwhich led his
imagination a thorny dance and before all was over playd the duce
and all with himfor sure as ever the word weakness was uttered and
struck full upon his brainso sure it set him upon running divisions
upon how many kinds of weaknesses there werethat there was such a
thing as weakness of the bodyas well as weakness of the mindand
then he would do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two
together How far the cause of all these vexations might or might not
have arisen out of himself

In short he had so many little subjects of disquietude springing out of
this one affair all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up
in it that my mother whatever was her journey up had but an uneasy
journey of it downIn a word as she complained to my uncle Toby he
would have tired out the patience of any flesh alive



Chapter 1XVII

Though my father travelled homewards as I told you in none of the
best of moodspshawing and pishing all the way downyet he had
the complaisance to keep the worst part of the story still to
himselfwhich was the resolution he had taken of doing himself
the justice which my uncle Tobys clause in the marriagesettlement
empowered him nor was it till the very night in which I was begot
which was thirteen months after that she had the least intimation of
his design when my father happening as you remember to be a little
chagrind and out of tempertook occasion as they lay chatting gravely
in bed afterwards talking over what was to cometo let her know that
she must accommodate herself as well as she could to the bargain made
between them in their marriagedeeds which was to lyein of her next
child in the country to balance the last years journey

My father was a gentleman of many virtuesbut he had a strong spice of
that in his temper which might or might not add to the numberTis
known by the name of perseverance in a good causeand of obstinacy in
a bad one Of this my mother had so much knowledge that she knew twas
to no purpose to make any remonstranceso she een resolved to sit
down quietly and make the most of it



Chapter 1XVIII

As the point was that night agreed or rather determined that my mother
should lyein of me in the country she took her measures accordingly
for which purpose when she was three days or thereabouts gone with
child she began to cast her eyes upon the midwife whom you have so
often heard me mention and before the week was well got round as
the famous Dr Manningham was not to be had she had come to a final
determination in her mindnotwithstanding there was a scientific
operator within so near a call as eight miles of us and who moreover
had expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of midwifery
in which he had exposed not only the blunders of the sisterhood
itselfbut had likewise superadded many curious improvements for the
quicker extraction of the foetus in cross births and some other cases
of danger which belay us in getting into the world notwithstanding all
this my mother I say was absolutely determined to trust her life and
mine with it into no souls hand but this old womans onlyNow this
I likewhen we cannot get at the very thing we wishnever to take
up with the next best in degree to itno thats pitiful beyond
descriptionit is no more than a week from this very day in which
I am now writing this book for the edification of the worldwhich is
March 9 1759that my dear dear Jenny observing I looked a little
grave as she stood cheapening a silk of fiveandtwenty shillings
a yardtold the mercer she was sorry she had given him so much
troubleand immediately went and bought herself a yardwide stuff of
tenpence a yardTis the duplication of one and the same greatness
of soul only what lessened the honour of it somewhat in my mothers
case was that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous
an extreme as one in her situation might have wished because the old
midwife had really some little claim to be depended uponas much at
least as success could give her having in the course of her practice
of near twenty years in the parish brought every mothers son of them
into the world without any one slip or accident which could fairly be
laid to her account

These facts tho they had their weight yet did not altogether satisfy
some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my fathers spirits
in relation to this choiceTo say nothing of the natural workings
of humanity and justiceor of the yearnings of parental and connubial
love all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in
a case of this kindhe felt himself concerned in a particular manner
that all should go right in the present casefrom the accumulated
sorrow he lay open to should any evil betide his wife and child in
lyingin at ShandyHallHe knew the world judged by events and would
add to his afflictions in such a misfortune by loading him with the
whole blame of itAlas odayhad Mrs Shandy poor gentlewoman
had but her wish in going up to town just to lyein and come down
againwhich they say she begged and prayed for upon her bare
kneesand which in my opinion considering the fortune which Mr
Shandy got with herwas no such mighty matter to have complied with
the lady and her babe might both of them have been alive at this hour

This exclamation my father knew was unanswerableand yet it was not
merely to shelter himselfnor was it altogether for the care of
his offspring and wife that he seemed so extremely anxious about this
pointmy father had extensive views of thingsand stood moreover as
he thought deeply concerned in it for the publick good from the dread
he entertained of the bad uses an illfated instance might be put to

He was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject had
unanimously agreed and lamented from the beginning of Queen Elizabeths
reign down to his own time that the current of men and money towards
the metropolis upon one frivolous errand or anotherset in so
strongas to become dangerous to our civil rightsthough by the
byea current was not the image he took most delight ina distemper
was here his favourite metaphor and he would run it down into a
perfect allegory by maintaining it was identically the same in the body
national as in the body natural where the blood and spirits were
driven up into the head faster than they could find their ways downa
stoppage of circulation must ensue which was death in both cases

There was little danger he would say of losing our liberties by
French politicks or French invasionsnor was he so much in pain of a
consumption from the mass of corrupted matter and ulcerated humours in
our constitution which he hoped was not so bad as it was imaginedbut
he verily feared that in some violent push we should go off all at
once in a stateapoplexyand then he would say The Lord have mercy
upon us all

My father was never able to give the history of this distemperwithout
the remedy along with it

Was I an absolute prince he would say pulling up his breeches with
both his hands as he rose from his armchair I would appoint able
judges at every avenue of my metropolis who should take cognizance of
every fools business who came thereand if upon a fair and candid
hearing it appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his own home and
come up bag and baggage with his wife and children farmers sons
c c at his backside they should be all sent back from constable
to constable like vagrants as they were to the place of their legal
settlements By this means I shall take care that my metropolis
totterd not thro its own weightthat the head be no longer too big
for the bodythat the extremes now wasted and pinnd in be restored
to their due share of nourishment and regain with it their natural
strength and beautyI would effectually provide That the meadows and
corn fields of my dominions should laugh and singthat good chear and
hospitality flourish once moreand that such weight and influence be
put thereby into the hands of the Squirality of my kingdom as should
counterpoise what I perceive my Nobility are now taking from them

Why are there so few palaces and gentlemens seats he would ask
with some emotion as he walked across the room throughout so many
delicious provinces in France Whence is it that the few remaining
Chateaus amongst them are so dismantledso unfurnished and in so
ruinous and desolate a conditionBecause Sir he would say in that
kingdom no man has any countryinterest to supportthe little interest
of any kind which any man has any where in it is concentrated in the
court and the looks of the Grand Monarch by the sunshine of whose
countenance or the clouds which pass across it every French man lives
or dies

Another political reason which prompted my father so strongly to
guard against the least evil accident in my mothers lyingin in the
countrywas That any such instance would infallibly throw a balance
of power too great already into the weaker vessels of the gentry in
his own or higher stationswhich with the many other usurped rights
which that part of the constitution was hourly establishingwould in
the end prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestick government
established in the first creation of things by God

In this point he was entirely of Sir Robert Filmers opinion That the
plans and institutions of the greatest monarchies in the eastern parts
of the world were originally all stolen from that admirable pattern
and prototype of this houshold and paternal powerwhich for a
century he said and more had gradually been degenerating away into
a mixd governmentthe form of which however desirable in great
combinations of the specieswas very troublesome in small onesand
seldom produced any thing that he saw but sorrow and confusion

For all these reasons private and publick put togethermy father
was for having the manmidwife by all meansmy mother by no means
My father beggd and intreated she would for once recede from her
prerogative in this matter and suffer him to choose for hermy
mother on the contrary insisted upon her privilege in this matter
to choose for herselfand have no mortals help but the old
womansWhat could my father do He was almost at his wits
endtalked it over with her in all moodsplaced his arguments in
all lightsargued the matter with her like a christianlike a
heathenlike a husbandlike a fatherlike a patriotlike a
manMy mother answered every thing only like a woman which was a
little hard upon herfor as she could not assume and fight it out
behind such a variety of characterstwas no fair matchtwas seven
to oneWhat could my mother doShe had the advantage otherwise
she had been certainly overpowered of a small reinforcement of chagrin
personal at the bottom which bore her up and enabled her to dispute
the affair with my father with so equal an advantagethat both sides
sung Te Deum In a word my mother was to have the old womanand the
operator was to have licence to drink a bottle of wine with my father
and my uncle Toby Shandy in the back parlourfor which he was to be
paid five guineas

I must beg leave before I finish this chapter to enter a caveat in the
breast of my fair readerand it is thisNot to take it absolutely
for granted from an unguarded word or two which I have droppd in
itThat I am a married manI own the tender appellation of
my dear dear Jennywith some other strokes of conjugal knowledge
interspersed here and there might naturally enough have misled
the most candid judge in the world into such a determination against
meAll I plead for in this case Madam is strict justice and that
you do so much of it to me as well as to yourselfas not to prejudge
or receive such an impression of me till you have better evidence
than I am positive at present can be produced against meNot that I
can be so vain or unreasonable Madam as to desire you should therefore
think that my dear dear Jenny is my kept mistressnothat would
be flattering my character in the other extreme and giving it an air of
freedom which perhaps it has no kind of right to All I contend for
is the utter impossibility for some volumes that you or the most
penetrating spirit upon earth should know how this matter really
standsIt is not impossible but that my dear dear Jenny tender as
the appellation is may be my childConsiderI was born in the
year eighteenNor is there any thing unnatural or extravagant in
the supposition that my dear Jenny may be my friendFriendMy
friendSurely Madam a friendship between the two sexes may subsist
and be supported withoutFy Mr ShandyWithout any thing Madam
but that tender and delicious sentiment which ever mixes in friendship
where there is a difference of sex Let me intreat you to study the
pure and sentimental parts of the best French Romancesit will really
Madam astonish you to see with what a variety of chaste expressions
this delicious sentiment which I have the honour to speak of is
dressd out



Chapter 1XIX

I would sooner undertake to explain the hardest problem in geometry
than pretend to account for it that a gentleman of my fathers great
good senseknowing as the reader must have observed him and curious
too in philosophywise also in political reasoningand in polemical
as he will find no way ignorantcould be capable of entertaining a
notion in his head so out of the common trackthat I fear the reader
when I come to mention it to him if he is the least of a cholerick
temper will immediately throw the book by if mercurial he will laugh
most heartily at itand if he is of a grave and saturnine cast he
will at first sight absolutely condemn as fanciful and extravagant
and that was in respect to the choice and imposition of christian names
on which he thought a great deal more depended than what superficial
minds were capable of conceiving

His opinion in this matter was That there was a strange kind of
magick bias which good or bad names as he called them irresistibly
impressed upon our characters and conduct

The hero of Cervantes argued not the point with more seriousnessnor
had he more faithor more to say on the powers of necromancy in
dishonouring his deedsor on Dulcineas name in shedding lustre upon
them than my father had on those of Trismegistus or Archimedes on
the one handor of Nyky and Simkin on the other How many Caesars
and Pompeys he would say by mere inspiration of the names have been
rendered worthy of them And how many he would add are there who
might have done exceeding well in the world had not their characters
and spirits been totally depressed and Nicodemusd into nothing

I see plainly Sir by your looks or as the case happened my father
would saythat you do not heartily subscribe to this opinion of
minewhich to those he would add who have not carefully sifted it
to the bottomI own has an air more of fancy than of solid reasoning
in itand yet my dear Sir if I may presume to know your character I
am morally assured I should hazard little in stating a case to you not
as a party in the disputebut as a judge and trusting my appeal upon
it to your own good sense and candid disquisition in this matteryou
are a person free from as many narrow prejudices of education as
most menand if I may presume to penetrate farther into youof a
liberality of genius above bearing down an opinion merely because it
wants friends Your sonyour dear sonfrom whose sweet and open
temper you have so much to expectYour Billy Sirwould you for
the world have called him JudasWould you my dear Sir he would say
laying his hand upon your breast with the genteelest addressand
in that soft and irresistible piano of voice which the nature of the
argumentum ad hominem absolutely requiresWould you Sir if a Jew of
a godfather had proposed the name for your child and offered you his
purse along with it would you have consented to such a desecration of
himO my God he would say looking up if I know your temper right
Siryou are incapable of ityou would have trampled upon the
offeryou would have thrown the temptation at the tempters head with
abhorrence

Your greatness of mind in this action which I admire with that
generous contempt of money which you shew me in the whole transaction
is really nobleand what renders it more so is the principle of
itthe workings of a parents love upon the truth and conviction
of this very hypothesis namely That was your son called Judasthe
forbid and treacherous idea so inseparable from the name would have
accompanied him through life like his shadow and in the end made a
miser and a rascal of him in spite Sir of your example

I never knew a man able to answer this argumentBut indeed to speak
of my father as he washe was certainly irresistibleboth in his
orations and disputationshe was born an oratorGreekPersuasion
hung upon his lips and the elements of Logick and Rhetorick were
so blended up in himand withal he had so shrewd a guess at the
weaknesses and passions of his respondentthat Nature might have stood
up and saidThis man is eloquentIn short whether he was on the
weak or the strong side of the question twas hazardous in either case
to attack himAnd yet tis strange he had never read Cicero nor
Quintilian de Oratore nor Isocrates nor Aristotle nor Longinus
amongst the antientsnor Vossius nor Skioppius nor Ramus nor
Farnaby amongst the modernsand what is more astonishing he had
never in his whole life the least light or spark of subtilty struck into
his mind by one single lecture upon Crackenthorp or Burgersdicius or
any Dutch logician or commentatorhe knew not so much as in what the
difference of an argument ad ignorantiam and an argument ad hominem
consisted so that I well remember when he went up along with me to
enter my name at Jesus College init was a matter of just
wonder with my worthy tutor and two or three fellows of that learned
societythat a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools
should be able to work after that fashion with them

To work with them in the best manner he could was what my father
was however perpetually forced uponfor he had a thousand little
sceptical notions of the comick kind to defendmost of which notions I
verily believe at first entered upon the footing of mere whims and of
a vive la Bagatelle and as such he would make merry with them for half
an hour or so and having sharpened his wit upon them dismiss them till
another day

I mention this not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture upon the
progress and establishment of my fathers many odd opinionsbut as a
warning to the learned reader against the indiscreet reception of such
guests who after a free and undisturbed entrance for some years
into our brainsat length claim a kind of settlement thereworking
sometimes like yeastbut more generally after the manner of the gentle
passion beginning in jestbut ending in downright earnest

Whether this was the case of the singularity of my fathers notionsor
that his judgment at length became the dupe of his witor how far
in many of his notions he might though odd be absolutely rightthe
reader as he comes at them shall decide All that I maintain here is
that in this one of the influence of christian names however it gained
footing he was serioushe was all uniformityhe was systematical
and like all systematic reasoners he would move both heaven and earth
and twist and torture every thing in nature to support his hypothesis
In a word I repeat it over againhe was seriousand in consequence
of it he would lose all kind of patience whenever he saw people
especially of condition who should have known betteras careless and
as indifferent about the name they imposed upon their childor more
so than in the choice of Ponto or Cupid for their puppydog

This he would say lookd illand had moreover this particular
aggravation in it viz That when once a vile name was wrongfully or
injudiciously given twas not like the case of a mans character
which when wrongd might hereafter be clearedand possibly some
time or other if not in the mans life at least after his deathbe
somehow or other set to rights with the world But the injury of this
he would say could never be undonenay he doubted even whether an
act of parliament could reach itHe knew as well as you that the
legislature assumed a power over surnamesbut for very strong reasons
which he could give it had never yet adventured he would say to go a
step farther

It was observable that tho my father in consequence of this opinion
had as I have told you the strongest likings and dislikings towards
certain namesthat there were still numbers of names which hung so
equally in the balance before him that they were absolutely indifferent
to him Jack Dick and Tom were of this class These my father called
neutral namesaffirming of them without a satire That there had
been as many knaves and fools at least as wise and good men since
the world began who had indifferently borne themso that like equal
forces acting against each other in contrary directions he thought
they mutually destroyed each others effects for which reason he would
often declare He would not give a cherrystone to choose amongst them
Bob which was my brothers name was another of these neutral kinds of
christian names which operated very little either way and as my father
happend to be at Epsom when it was given himhe would ofttimes
thank Heaven it was no worse Andrew was something like a
negative quantity in Algebra with himtwas worse he said than
nothingWilliam stood pretty highNumps again was low with himand
Nick he said was the Devil

But of all names in the universe he had the most unconquerable aversion
for Tristramhe had the lowest and most contemptible opinion of it of
any thing in the worldthinking it could possibly produce nothing in
rerum natura but what was extremely mean and pitiful So that in
the midst of a dispute on the subject in which by the bye he was
frequently involvedhe would sometimes break off in a sudden and
spirited Epiphonema or rather Erotesis raised a third and sometimes a
full fifth above the key of the discourseand demand it categorically
of his antagonist Whether he would take upon him to say he had ever
rememberedwhether he had ever reador even whether he had ever
heard tell of a man called Tristram performing any thing great
or worth recordingNohe would sayTristramThe thing is
impossible

What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to
publish this notion of his to the world Little boots it to the subtle
speculatist to stand single in his opinionsunless he gives them
proper ventIt was the identical thing which my father didfor in
the year sixteen which was two years before I was born he was at
the pains of writing an express Dissertation simply upon the word
Tristramshewing the world with great candour and modesty the
grounds of his great abhorrence to the name

When this story is compared with the titlepageWill not the
gentle reader pity my father from his soulto see an orderly and
welldisposed gentleman who tho singularyet inoffensive in his
notionsso played upon in them by cross purposesto look down upon
the stage and see him baffled and overthrown in all his little systems
and wishes to behold a train of events perpetually falling out against
him and in so critical and cruel a way as if they had purposedly been
plannd and pointed against him merely to insult his speculationsIn
a word to behold such a one in his old age illfitted for troubles
ten times in a day suffering sorrowten times in a day calling the
child of his prayers TristramMelancholy dissyllable of sound which
to his ears was unison to Nincompoop and every name vituperative
under heavenBy his ashes I swear itif ever malignant spirit took
pleasure or busied itself in traversing the purposes of mortal manit
must have been hereand if it was not necessary I should be born
before I was christened I would this moment give the reader an account
of it



Chapter 1XX

How could you Madam be so inattentive in reading the last chapter I
told you in it That my mother was not a papistPapist You told me
no such thing SirMadam I beg leave to repeat it over again that I
told you as plain at least as words by direct inference could tell
you such a thingThen Sir I must have missd a pageNo Madam
you have not missd a wordThen I was asleep SirMy pride Madam
cannot allow you that refugeThen I declare I know nothing at all
about the matterThat Madam is the very fault I lay to your charge
and as a punishment for it I do insist upon it that you immediately
turn back that is as soon as you get to the next full stop and read
the whole chapter over again I have imposed this penance upon the lady
neither out of wantonness nor cruelty but from the best of motives and
therefore shall make her no apology for it when she returns backTis
to rebuke a vicious taste which has crept into thousands besides
herselfof reading straight forwards more in quest of the adventures
than of the deep erudition and knowledge which a book of this cast if
read over as it should be would infallibly impart with themThe
mind should be accustomed to make wise reflections and draw curious
conclusions as it goes along the habitude of which made Pliny the
younger affirm That he never read a book so bad but he drew some
profit from it The stories of Greece and Rome run over without this
turn and applicationdo less service I affirm it than the history of
Parismus and Parismenus or of the Seven Champions of England read with
it

But here comes my fair lady Have you read over again the chapter
Madam as I desired youYou have And did you not observe the passage
upon the second reading which admits the inferenceNot a word like
it Then Madam be pleased to ponder well the last line but one of the
chapter where I take upon me to say It was necessary I should be
born before I was christend Had my mother Madam been a Papist that
consequence did not follow The Romish Rituals direct the baptizing
of the child in cases of danger before it is bornbut upon this
proviso That some part or other of the childs body be seen by the
baptizerBut the Doctors of the Sorbonne by a deliberation held
amongst them April 10 1733have enlarged the powers of the
midwives by determining That though no part of the childs body should
appearthat baptism shall nevertheless be administered to it by
injectionpar le moyen dune petite canulleAnglice a squirtTis
very strange that St Thomas Aquinas who had so good a mechanical head
both for tying and untying the knots of schooldivinityshould after
so much pains bestowed upon thisgive up the point at last as a
second La chose impossibleInfantes in maternis uteris existentes
quoth St Thomas baptizari possunt nullo modoO Thomas Thomas
If the reader has the curiosity to see the question upon baptism by
injection as presented to the Doctors of the Sorbonne with their
consultation thereupon it is as follows

It is a terrible misfortune for this same book of mine but more so to
the Republick of lettersso that my own is quite swallowed up in
the consideration of itthat this selfsame vile pruriency for
fresh adventures in all things has got so strongly into our habit and
humourand so wholly intent are we upon satisfying the impatience of
our concupiscence that waythat nothing but the gross and more
carnal parts of a composition will go downThe subtle hints and sly
communications of science fly off like spirits upwardsthe heavy
moral escapes downwards and both the one and the other are as much lost
to the world as if they were still left in the bottom of the inkhorn

I wish the malereader has not passd by many a one as quaint and
curious as this one in which the femalereader has been detected I
wish it may have its effectsand that all good people both male and
female from example may be taught to think as well as read

Reponse

Le Conseil estime que la question proposee souffre de grandes
difficultes Les Theologiens posent dun cote pour principe que
le bapteme qui est une naissance spirituelle suppose une premiere
naissance il faut etre ne dans le monde pour renaitre en Jesus Christ
comme ils lenseignent S Thomas 3 part quaest 88 artic II suit
cette doctrine comme une verite constante lon ne peut dit ce S
Docteur baptiser les enfans qui sont renfermes dans le sein de leurs
meres  S Thomas est fonde sur ce que les enfans ne sont point nes 
ne peuvent etre comptes parmi les autres hommes dou il conclud quils
ne peuvent etre lobjet dune action exterieure pour recevoir par leur
ministere les sacremens necessaires au salut Pueri in maternis uteris
existentes nondum prodierunt in lucem ut cum aliis hominibus vitam
ducant unde non possunt subjici actioni humanae ut per eorum
ministerium sacramenta recipiant ad salutem Les rituels ordonnent dans
la pratique ce que les theologiens ont etabli sur les memes matieres 
ils deffendent tous dune maniere uniforme de baptiser les enfans
qui sont renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres sils ne sont paroitre
quelque partie de leurs corps Le concours des theologiens  des
rituels qui sont les regles des dioceses paroit former une autorite
qui termine la question presente cependant le conseil de conscience
considerant dun cote que le raisonnement des theologiens est
uniquement fonde sur une raison de convenance  que la deffense des
rituels suppose que lon ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi
renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres ce qui est contre la supposition
presente  dun autre cote considerant que les memes theologiens
enseignent que lon peut risquer les sacremens que Jesus Christ a
etablis comme des moyens faciles mais necessaires pour sanctifier les
hommes  dailleurs estimant que les enfans renfermes dans le sein
de leurs meres pourroient etre capables de salut parcequils sont
capables de damnationpour ces considerations  en egard a lexpose
suivant lequel on assure avoir trouve un moyen certain de baptiser ces
enfans ainsi renfermes sans faire aucun tort a la mere le Conseil
estime que lon pourroit se servir du moyen propose dans la confiance
quil a que Dieu na point laisse ces sortes denfans sans aucuns
secours  supposant comme il est expose que le moyen dont il sagit
est propre a leur procurer le bapteme cependant comme il sagiroit en
autorisant la pratique proposee de changer une regle universellement
etablie le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit saddresser a
son eveque  a qui il appartient de juger de lutilite  du danger
du moyen propose  comme sous le bon plaisir de leveque le Conseil
estime quil faudroit recourir au Pape qui a le droit dexpliquer les
regles de leglise  dy deroger dans le cas ou la loi ne scauroit
obliger quelque sage  quelque utile que paroisse la maniere de
baptiser dont il sagit le Conseil ne pourroit lapprover sans le
concours de ces deux autorites On conseile au moins a celui qui
consulte de saddresser a son eveque  de lui faire part de la
presente decision afin que si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur
lesquelles les docteurs soussignes sappuyent il puisse etre autorise
dans le cas de necessite ou il risqueroit trop dattendre que la
permission fut demandee  accordee demployer le moyen quil propose si
avantageux au salut de lenfant Au reste le Conseil en estimant que
lon pourroit sen servir croit cependant que si les enfans dont il
sagit venoient au monde contre lesperance de ceux qui se seroient
servis du meme moyen il seroit necessaire de les baptiser sous
condition  en cela le Conseil se conforme a tous les rituels qui en
autorisant le bapteme dun enfant qui fait paroitre quelque partie
de son corps enjoignent neantmoins  ordonnent de le baptiser sous
condition sil vient heureusement au monde

and before that of consummation the baptizing all the Homunculi at

Chapter 1XXI

I wonder whats all that noise and running backwards and forwards
for above stairs quoth my father addressing himself after an hour
and a halfs silence to my uncle Tobywho you must know was sitting
on the opposite side of the fire smoaking his social pipe all the time
in mute contemplation of a new pair of black plushbreeches which he
had got onWhat can they be doing brotherquoth my fatherwe can
scarce hear ourselves talk

I think replied my uncle Toby taking his pipe from his mouth and
striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of his left
thumb as he began his sentenceI think says heBut to enter
rightly into my uncle Tobys sentiments upon this matter you must be
made to enter first a little into his character the outlines of which
I shall just give you and then the dialogue between him and my father
will go on as well again

Pray what was that mans namefor I write in such a hurry I have no
time to recollect or look for itwho first made the observation That
there was great inconstancy in our air and climate Whoever he was
twas a just and good observation in himBut the corollary drawn from
it namely That it is this which has furnished us with such a variety
of odd and whimsical charactersthat was not hisit was found
out by another man at least a century and a half after him Then
againthat this copious storehouse of original materials is the true
and natural cause that our Comedies are so much better than those
of France or any others that either have or can be wrote upon the
Continentthat discovery was not fully made till about the middle of
King Williams reignwhen the great Dryden in writing one of his long
prefaces if I mistake not most fortunately hit upon it Indeed toward
the latter end of queen Anne the great Addison began to patronize the
notion and more fully explained it to the world in one or two of his
Spectatorsbut the discovery was not hisThen fourthly and lastly
that this strange irregularity in our climate producing so strange an
irregularity in our charactersdoth thereby in some sort make us
amends by giving us somewhat to make us merry with when the weather
will not suffer us to go out of doorsthat observation is my ownand
was struck out by me this very rainy day March 26 1759 and betwixt
the hours of nine and ten in the morning

Thusthus my fellowlabourers and associates in this great harvest of
our learning now ripening before our eyes thus it is by slow steps
of casual increase that our knowledge physical metaphysical
physiological polemical nautical mathematical aenigmatical
technical biographical romantical chemical and obstetrical with
fifty other branches of it most of em ending as these do in ical
have for these two last centuries and more gradually been creeping
upwards towards that Akme of their perfections from which if we may
form a conjecture from the advances of these last seven years we cannot
possibly be far off

When that happens it is to be hoped it will put an end to all kind of
writings whatsoeverthe want of all kind of writing will put an end to
all kind of readingand that in time As war begets poverty poverty
peacemust in course put an end to all kind of knowledgeand
thenwe shall have all to begin over again or in other words be
exactly where we started

Happy Thrice happy times I only wish that the aera of my begetting
as well as the mode and manner of it had been a little alterdor
that it could have been put off with any convenience to my father or
mother for some twenty or fiveandtwenty years longer when a man in
the literary world might have stood some chance

But I forget my uncle Toby whom all this while we have left knocking
the ashes out of his tobaccopipe

His humour was of that particular species which does honour to our
atmosphere and I should have made no scruple of ranking him amongst
one of the firstrate productions of it had not there appeared too many
strong lines in it of a familylikeness which shewed that he derived
the singularity of his temper more from blood than either wind or
water or any modifications or combinations of them whatever And I
have therefore ofttimes wondered that my father tho I believe he
had his reasons for it upon his observing some tokens of eccentricity
in my course when I was a boyshould never once endeavour to account
for them in this way for all the Shandy Family were of an original
character throughoutI mean the malesthe females had no character
at allexcept indeed my great aunt Dinah who about sixty years
ago was married and got with child by the coachman for which my
father according to his hypothesis of christian names would often say
She might thank her godfathers and godmothers

It will seem strangeand I would as soon think of dropping a riddle
in the readers way which is not my interest to do as set him upon
guessing how it could come to pass that an event of this kind so many
years after it had happened should be reserved for the interruption of
the peace and unity which otherwise so cordially subsisted between my
father and my uncle Toby One would have thought that the whole force
of the misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at
firstas is generally the caseBut nothing ever wrought with our
family after the ordinary way Possibly at the very time this happened
it might have something else to afflict it and as afflictions are sent
down for our good and that as this had never done the Shandy Family
any good at all it might lie waiting till apt times and circumstances
should give it an opportunity to discharge its officeObserve
I determine nothing upon thisMy way is ever to point out to the
curious different tracts of investigation to come at the first springs
of the events I tellnot with a pedantic Fescueor in the decisive
manner or Tacitus who outwits himself and his readerbut with the
officious humility of a heart devoted to the assistance merely of the
inquisitiveto them I writeand by them I shall be readif any
such reading as this could be supposed to hold out so longto the very
end of the world

Why this cause of sorrow therefore was thus reserved for my father and
uncle is undetermined by me But how and in what direction it exerted
itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them after
it began to operate is what I am able to explain with great exactness
and is as follows

My uncle Toby Shandy Madam was a gentleman who with the virtues
which usually constitute the character of a man of honour and
rectitudepossessed one in a very eminent degree which is seldom
or never put into the catalogue and that was a most extreme and
unparalleld modesty of naturethough I correct the word nature for
this reason that I may not prejudge a point which must shortly come
to a hearing and that is Whether this modesty of his was natural or
acquirdWhichever way my uncle Toby came by it twas nevertheless
modesty in the truest sense of it and that is Madam not in regard to
words for he was so unhappy as to have very little choice in thembut
to thingsand this kind of modesty so possessed him and it arose to
such a height in him as almost to equal if such a thing could be
even the modesty of a woman That female nicety Madam and inward
cleanliness of mind and fancy in your sex which makes you so much the
awe of ours

You will imagine Madam that my uncle Toby had contracted all this
from this very sourcethat he had spent a great part of his time in
converse with your sex and that from a thorough knowledge of you and
the force of imitation which such fair examples render irresistible he
had acquired this amiable turn of mind

I wish I could say sofor unless it was with his sisterinlaw my
fathers wife and my mothermy uncle Toby scarce exchanged three words
with the sex in as many yearsno he got it Madam by a blowA
blowYes Madam it was owing to a blow from a stone broke off by a
ball from the parapet of a hornwork at the siege of Namur which struck
full upon my uncle Tobys groinWhich way could that effect it The
story of that Madam is long and interestingbut it would be running
my history all upon heaps to give it you hereTis for an episode
hereafter and every circumstance relating to it in its proper place
shall be faithfully laid before youTill then it is not in my power
to give farther light into this matter or say more than what I have
said alreadyThat my uncle Toby was a gentleman of unparalleld
modesty which happening to be somewhat subtilized and rarified by the
constant heat of a little family pridethey both so wrought together
within him that he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt Dinah
touchd upon but with the greatest emotionThe least hint of it was
enough to make the blood fly into his facebut when my father enlarged
upon the story in mixed companies which the illustration of his
hypothesis frequently obliged him to dothe unfortunate blight of one
of the fairest branches of the family would set my uncle Tobys honour
and modesty obleeding and he would often take my father aside in the
greatest concern imaginable to expostulate and tell him he would give
him any thing in the world only to let the story rest

My father I believe had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle
Toby that ever one brother bore towards another and would have done
any thing in nature which one brother in reason could have desird of
another to have made my uncle Tobys heart easy in this or any other
point But this lay out of his power

My father as I told you was a philosopher in
grainspeculativesystematicaland my aunt Dinahs affair was
a matter of as much consequence to him as the retrogradation of the
planets to CopernicusThe backslidings of Venus in her orbit fortified
the Copernican system called so after his name and the backslidings
of my aunt Dinah in her orbit did the same service in establishing my
fathers system which I trust will for ever hereafter be called the
Shandean System after his

In any other family dishonour my father I believe had as nice a
sense of shame as any man whateverand neither he nor I dare say
Copernicus would have divulged the affair in either case or have taken
the least notice of it to the world but for the obligations they
owed as they thought to truthAmicus Plato my father would say
construing the words to my uncle Toby as he went along Amicus Plato
that is Dinah was my auntsed magis amica veritasbut Truth is my
sister

This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle was the
source of many a fraternal squabble The one could not bear to hear the
tale of family disgrace recordedand the other would scarce ever let a
day pass to an end without some hint at it

For Gods sake my uncle Toby would cryand for my sake and for all
our sakes my dear brother Shandydo let this story of our aunts
and her ashes sleep in peacehow can youhow can you have so little
feeling and compassion for the character of our familyWhat is the
character of a family to an hypothesis my father would replyNay
if you come to thatwhat is the life of a familyThe life of a
familymy uncle Toby would say throwing himself back in his arm
chair and lifting up his hands his eyes and one legYes the
lifemy father would say maintaining his point How many thousands
of em are there every year that come cast away in all civilized
countries at leastand considered as nothing but common air in
competition of an hypothesis In my plain sense of things my uncle Toby
would answerevery such instance is downright Murder let who will
commit itThere lies your mistake my father would replyfor in
Foro Scientiae there is no such thing as Murdertis only Death
brother

My uncle Toby would never offer to answer this by any other kind of
argument than that of whistling half a dozen bars of LillebulleroYou
must know it was the usual channel thro which his passions got vent
when any thing shocked or surprized himbut especially when any thing
which he deemd very absurd was offered

As not one of our logical writers nor any of the commentators upon
them that I remember have thought proper to give a name to this
particular species of argumentI here take the liberty to do it
myself for two reasons First That in order to prevent all confusion
in disputes it may stand as much distinguished for ever from every
other species of argumentas the Argumentum ad Verecundiam ex Absurdo
ex Fortiori or any other argument whatsoeverAnd secondly That
it may be said by my childrens children when my head is laid to
restthat their learnd grandfathers head had been busied to as
much purpose once as other peoplesThat he had invented a name and
generously thrown it into the Treasury of the Ars Logica for one of
the most unanswerable arguments in the whole science And if the end
of disputation is more to silence than convincethey may add if they
please to one of the best arguments too

I do therefore by these presents strictly order and command That
it be known and distinguished by the name and title of the Argumentum
Fistulatorium and no otherand that it rank hereafter with the
Argumentum Baculinum and the Argumentum ad Crumenam and for ever
hereafter be treated of in the same chapter

As for the Argumentum Tripodium which is never used but by the woman
against the manand the Argumentum ad Rem which contrarywise is
made use of by the man only against the womanAs these two are enough
in conscience for one lectureand moreover as the one is the best
answer to the otherlet them likewise be kept apart and be treated of
in a place by themselves




Chapter 1XXII

The learned Bishop Hall I mean the famous Dr Joseph Hall who was
Bishop of Exeter in King James the Firsts reign tells us in one of
Decads at the end of his divine art of meditation imprinted at London
in the year 1610 by John Beal dwelling in Aldersgatestreet That
it is an abominable thing for a man to commend himselfand I really
think it is so

And yet on the other hand when a thing is executed in a masterly kind
of a fashion which thing is not likely to be found outI think it is
full as abominable that a man should lose the honour of it and go out
of the world with the conceit of it rotting in his head

This is precisely my situation

 For in this long digression which I was accidentally led into as in all
my digressions one only excepted there is a masterstroke of
digressive skill the merit of which has all along I fear been
overlooked by my readernot for want of penetration in himbut
because tis an excellence seldom looked for or expected indeed in a
digressionand it is this That tho my digressions are all fair as
you observeand that I fly off from what I am about as far and as
often too as any writer in Great Britain yet I constantly take care
to order affairs so that my main business does not stand still in my
absence

I was just going for example to have given you the great outlines of
my uncle Tobys most whimsical characterwhen my aunt Dinah and the
coachman came across us and led us a vagary some millions of miles into
the very heart of the planetary system Notwithstanding all this you
perceive that the drawing of my uncle Tobys character went on gently
all the timenot the great contours of itthat was impossiblebut
some familiar strokes and faint designations of it were here and there
touchd on as we went along so that you are much better acquainted
with my uncle Toby now than you was before

By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by itself
two contrary motions are introduced into it and reconciled which
were thought to be at variance with each other In a word my work is
digressive and it is progressive tooand at the same time

This Sir is a very different story from that of the earths moving
round her axis in her diurnal rotation with her progress in her
elliptick orbit which brings about the year and constitutes that
variety and vicissitude of seasons we enjoythough I own it suggested
the thoughtas I believe the greatest of our boasted improvements and
discoveries have come from such trifling hints

Digressions incontestably are the sunshinethey are the life the
soul of readingtake them out of this book for instanceyou might
as well take the book along with themone cold eternal winter would
reign in every page of it restore them to the writerhe steps forth
like a bridegroombids Allhail brings in variety and forbids the
appetite to fail

All the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them so as
to be not only for the advantage of the reader but also of the author
whose distress in this matter is truly pitiable For if he begins a
digressionfrom that moment I observe his whole work stands stock
stilland if he goes on with his main workthen there is an end of
his digression

This is vile workFor which reason from the beginning of this you
see I have constructed the main work and the adventitious parts of
it with such intersections and have so complicated and involved the
digressive and progressive movements one wheel within another that the
whole machine in general has been kept agoingand whats more it
shall be kept agoing these forty years if it pleases the fountain of
health to bless me so long with life and good spirits



Chapter 1XXIII

I have a strong propensity in me to begin this chapter very
nonsensically and I will not balk my fancyAccordingly I set off
thus

If the fixture of Momuss glass in the human breast according to the
proposed emendation of that archcritick had taken placefirst This
foolish consequence would certainly have followedThat the very
wisest and very gravest of us all in one coin or other must have paid
windowmoney every day of our lives

And secondly that had the said glass been there set up nothing more
would have been wanting in order to have taken a mans character but
to have taken a chair and gone softly as you would to a dioptrical
beehive and lookd inviewd the soul stark nakedobserved all
her motionsher machinationstraced all her maggots from their first
engendering to their crawling forthwatched her loose in her frisks
her gambols her capricios and after some notice of her more solemn
deportment consequent upon such frisks cthen taken your pen and
ink and set down nothing but what you had seen and could have sworn
toBut this is an advantage not to be had by the biographer in this
planetin the planet Mercury belike it may be so if not better
still for himfor there the intense heat of the country which is
proved by computators from its vicinity to the sun to be more than
equal to that of redhot ironmust I think long ago have vitrified
the bodies of the inhabitants as the efficient cause to suit them for
the climate which is the final cause so that betwixt them both all
the tenements of their souls from top to bottom may be nothing else
for aught the soundest philosophy can shew to the contrary but one fine
transparent body of clear glass bating the umbilical knotso that
till the inhabitants grow old and tolerably wrinkled whereby the rays
of light in passing through them become so monstrously refractedor
return reflected from their surfaces in such transverse lines to the
eye that a man cannot be seen throughhis soul might as well unless
for mere ceremony or the trifling advantage which the umbilical point
gave hermight upon all other accounts I say as well play the fool
out odoors as in her own house

But this as I said above is not the case of the inhabitants of this
earthour minds shine not through the body but are wrapt up here in
a dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood so that if we would
come to the specific characters of them we must go some other way to
work

Many in good truth are the ways which human wit has been forced to
take to do this thing with exactness

Some for instance draw all their characters with
windinstrumentsVirgil takes notice of that way in the affair of
Dido and Aeneasbut it is as fallacious as the breath of fameand
moreover bespeaks a narrow genius I am not ignorant that the Italians
pretend to a mathematical exactness in their designations of one
particular sort of character among them from the forte or piano of a
certain windinstrument they usewhich they say is infallibleI dare
not mention the name of the instrument in this placetis sufficient
we have it amongst usbut never think of making a drawing by itthis
is aenigmatical and intended to be so at least ad populumAnd
therefore I beg Madam when you come here that you read on as fast as
you can and never stop to make any inquiry about it

There are others again who will draw a mans character from no other
helps in the world but merely from his evacuationsbut this often
gives a very incorrect outlineunless indeed you take a sketch
of his repletions too and by correcting one drawing from the other
compound one good figure out of them both

I should have no objection to this method but that I think it must
smell too strong of the lampand be renderd still more operose by
forcing you to have an eye to the rest of his NonnaturalsWhy
the most natural actions of a mans life should be called his
Nonnaturalsis another question

There are others fourthly who disdain every one of these
expedientsnot from any fertility of their own but from the various
ways of doing it which they have borrowed from the honourable devices
which the Pentagraphic Brethren Pentagraph an instrument to copy
Prints and Pictures mechanically and in any proportion of the brush
have shewn in taking copiesThese you must know are your great
historians

One of these you will see drawing a full length character against the
lightthats illiberaldishonestand hard upon the character of
the man who sits

Others to mend the matter will make a drawing of you in the
Camerathat is most unfair of all because there you are sure to be
represented in some of your most ridiculous attitudes

To avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my uncle
Tobys character I am determined to draw it by no mechanical help
whatevernor shall my pencil be guided by any one windinstrument
which ever was blown upon either on this or on the other side of the
Alpsnor will I consider either his repletions or his dischargesor
touch upon his Nonnaturals but in a word I will draw my uncle Tobys
character from his HobbyHorse



Chapter 1XXIV

If I was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all patience
for my uncle Tobys characterI would here previously have convinced
him that there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with as
that which I have pitchd upon

A man and his HobbyHorse tho I cannot say that they act and react
exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each
other Yet doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind
and my opinion rather is that there is something in it more of the
manner of electrified bodiesand that by means of the heated parts
of the rider which come immediately into contact with the back of the
HobbyHorseby long journies and much friction it so happens that
the body of the rider is at length filld as full of HobbyHorsical
matter as it can holdso that if you are able to give but a clear
description of the nature of the one you may form a pretty exact notion
of the genius and character of the other

Now the HobbyHorse which my uncle Toby always rode upon was in my
opinion an HobbyHorse well worth giving a description of if it was
only upon the score of his great singularityfor you might have
travelled from York to Doverfrom Dover to Penzance in Cornwall and
from Penzance to York back again and not have seen such another upon
the road or if you had seen such a one whatever haste you had been in
you must infallibly have stoppd to have taken a view of him Indeed
the gait and figure of him was so strange and so utterly unlike was he
from his head to his tail to any one of the whole species that it
was now and then made a matter of disputewhether he was really a
HobbyHorse or no But as the Philosopher would use no other argument to
the Sceptic who disputed with him against the reality of motion save
that of rising up upon his legs and walking across the roomso would
my uncle Toby use no other argument to prove his HobbyHorse was
a HobbyHorse indeed but by getting upon his back and riding him
aboutleaving the world after that to determine the point as it
thought fit

In good truth my uncle Toby mounted him with so much pleasure and he
carried my uncle Toby so wellthat he troubled his head very little
with what the world either said or thought about it

It is now high time however that I give you a description of himBut
to go on regularly I only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you
first how my uncle Toby came by him



Chapter 1XXV

The wound in my uncle Tobys groin which he received at the siege of
Namur rendering him unfit for the service it was thought expedient he
should return to England in order if possible to be set to rights

He was four years totally confinedpart of it to his bed and all of
it to his room and in the course of his cure which was all that
time in hand sufferd unspeakable miseriesowing to a succession of
exfoliations from the os pubis and the outward edge of that part of the
coxendix called the os illiumboth which bones were dismally crushd
as much by the irregularity of the stone which I told you was broke off
the parapetas by its sizetho it was pretty large which inclined
the surgeon all along to think that the great injury which it had
done my uncle Tobys groin was more owing to the gravity of the stone
itself than to the projectile force of itwhich he would often tell
him was a great happiness

My father at that time was just beginning business in London and had
taken a houseand as the truest friendship and cordiality subsisted
between the two brothersand that my father thought my uncle Toby
could no where be so well nursed and taken care of as in his own
househe assignd him the very best apartment in itAnd what was a
much more sincere mark of his affection still he would never suffer a
friend or an acquaintance to step into the house on any occasion but
he would take him by the hand and lead him up stairs to see his brother
Toby and chat an hour by his bedside

The history of a soldiers wound beguiles the pain of itmy uncles
visitors at least thought so and in their daily calls upon him from
the courtesy arising out of that belief they would frequently turn the
discourse to that subjectand from that subject the discourse would
generally roll on to the siege itself

These conversations were infinitely kind and my uncle Toby received
great relief from them and would have received much more but that they
brought him into some unforeseen perplexities which for three months
together retarded his cure greatly and if he had not hit upon an
expedient to extricate himself out of them I verily believe they would
have laid him in his grave

What these perplexities of my uncle Toby weretis impossible for you
to guessif you couldI should blush not as a relationnot as a
mannor even as a womanbut I should blush as an author inasmuch
as I set no small store by myself upon this very account that my reader
has never yet been able to guess at any thing And in this Sir I am
of so nice and singular a humour that if I thought you was able to form
the least judgment or probable conjecture to yourself of what was to
come in the next pageI would tear it out of my book



Chapter 1XXVI

I have begun a new book on purpose that I might have room enough
to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle Toby was
involved from the many discourses and interrogations about the siege of
Namur where he received his wound

I must remind the reader in case he has read the history of King
Williams warsbut if he has notI then inform him that one of the
most memorable attacks in that siege was that which was made by the
English and Dutch upon the point of the advanced counterscarp between
the gate of St Nicolas which inclosed the great sluice or waterstop
where the English were terribly exposed to the shot of the counterguard
and demibastion of St Roch The issue of which hot dispute in
three words was this That the Dutch lodged themselves upon the
counterguardand that the English made themselves masters of the
coveredway before St Nicolasgate notwithstanding the gallantry of
the French officers who exposed themselves upon the glacis sword in
hand

As this was the principal attack of which my uncle Toby was an
eyewitness at Namurthe army of the besiegers being cut off by the
confluence of the Maes and Sambre from seeing much of each others
operationsmy uncle Toby was generally more eloquent and particular in
his account of it and the many perplexities he was in arose out of
the almost insurmountable difficulties he found in telling his story
intelligibly and giving such clear ideas of the differences and
distinctions between the scarp and counterscarpthe glacis and
coveredwaythe halfmoon and ravelinas to make his company fully
comprehend where and what he was about

Writers themselves are too apt to confound these terms so that you will
the less wonder if in his endeavours to explain them and in opposition
to many misconceptions that my uncle Toby did ofttimes puzzle his
visitors and sometimes himself too

To speak the truth unless the company my father led up stairs were
tolerably clearheaded or my uncle Toby was in one of his explanatory
moods twas a difficult thing do what he could to keep the discourse
free from obscurity

What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle
Toby was thisthat in the attack of the counterscarp before the gate
of St Nicolas extending itself from the bank of the Maes quite up
to the great waterstopthe ground was cut and cross cut with such a
multitude of dykes drains rivulets and sluices on all sidesand
he would get so sadly bewildered and set fast amongst them that
frequently he could neither get backwards or forwards to save his life
and was ofttimes obliged to give up the attack upon that very account
only

These perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle Toby Shandy more perturbations
than you would imagine and as my fathers kindness to him was
continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh enquirershe had but a
very uneasy task of it

No doubt my uncle Toby had great command of himselfand could guard
appearances I believe as well as most menyet any one may imagine
that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into
the halfmoon or get out of the coveredway without falling down the
counterscarp nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into
the ditch but that he must have fretted and fumed inwardlyHe did
soand the little and hourly vexations which may seem trifling and
of no account to the man who has not read Hippocrates yet whoever has
read Hippocrates or Dr James Mackenzie and has considered well the
effects which the passions and affections of the mind have upon the
digestionWhy not of a wound as well as of a dinnermay easily
conceive what sharp paroxysms and exacerbations of his wound my uncle
Toby must have undergone upon that score only

My uncle Toby could not philosophize upon ittwas enough he felt
it was soand having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three
months together he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself

He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed the anguish and
nature of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lie in no other
position when a thought came into his head that if he could purchase
such a thing and have it pasted down upon a board as a large map of
the fortification of the town and citadel of Namur with its environs
it might be a means of giving him easeI take notice of his desire
to have the environs along with the town and citadel for this
reasonbecause my uncle Tobys wound was got in one of the traverses
about thirty toises from the returning angle of the trench opposite
to the salient angle of the demibastion of St Rochso that he was
pretty confident he could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground
where he was standing on when the stone struck him

All this succeeded to his wishes and not only freed him from a world
of sad explanations but in the end it proved the happy means as you
will read of procuring my uncle Toby his HobbyHorse



Chapter 1XXVII

There is nothing so foolish when you are at the expence of making an
entertainment of this kind as to order things so badly as to let your
criticks and gentry of refined taste run it down Nor is there any thing
so likely to make them do it as that of leaving them out of the party
or what is full as offensive of bestowing your attention upon the rest
of your guests in so particular a way as if there was no such thing as
a critick by occupation at table

I guard against both for in the first place I have left half a
dozen places purposely open for themand in the next place I pay them
all courtGentlemen I kiss your hands I protest no company could
give me half the pleasureby my soul I am glad to see youI beg
only you will make no strangers of yourselves but sit down without any
ceremony and fall on heartily

I said I had left six places and I was upon the point of carrying my
complaisance so far as to have left a seventh open for themand in
this very spot I stand on but being told by a Critick tho not by
occupationbut by nature that I had acquitted myself well enough
I shall fill it up directly hoping in the mean time that I shall be
able to make a great deal of more room next year

How in the name of wonder could your uncle Toby who it seems was
a military man and whom you have represented as no foolbe at the
same time such a confused puddingheaded muddleheaded fellow asGo
look

So Sir Critick I could have replied but I scorn itTis language
unurbaneand only befitting the man who cannot give clear and
satisfactory accounts of things or dive deep enough into the first
causes of human ignorance and confusion It is moreover the reply
valiantand therefore I reject it for tho it might have suited my
uncle Tobys character as a soldier excellently welland had he not
accustomed himself in such attacks to whistle the Lillabullero as
he wanted no courage tis the very answer he would have given yet it
would by no means have done for me You see as plain as can be that I
write as a man of eruditionthat even my similies my allusions my
illustrations my metaphors are eruditeand that I must sustain
my character properly and contrast it properly tooelse what would
become of me Why Sir I should be undoneat this very moment that
I am going here to fill up one place against a critickI should have
made an opening for a couple

Therefore I answer thus

Pray Sir in all the reading which you have ever read did you ever
read such a book as Lockes Essay upon the Human UnderstandingDont
answer me rashlybecause many I know quote the book who have not
read itand many have read it who understand it notIf either of
these is your case as I write to instruct I will tell you in three
words what the book isIt is a historyA history of who what
where when Dont hurry yourselfIt is a historybook Sir which may
possibly recommend it to the world of what passes in a mans own mind
and if you will say so much of the book and no more believe me you
will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphysick circle

But this by the way

Now if you will venture to go along with me and look down into the
bottom of this matter it will be found that the cause of obscurity and
confusion in the mind of a man is threefold

Dull organs dear Sir in the first place Secondly slight and
transient impressions made by the objects when the said organs are not
dull And thirdly a memory like unto a sieve not able to retain what
it has receivedCall down Dolly your chambermaid and I will give you
my cap and bell along with it if I make not this matter so plain that
Dolly herself should understand it as well as MalbranchWhen Dolly has
indited her epistle to Robin and has thrust her arm into the bottom
of her pocket hanging by her right sidetake that opportunity to
recollect that the organs and faculties of perception can by nothing
in this world be so aptly typified and explained as by that one thing
which Dollys hand is in search ofYour organs are not so dull that I
should inform youtis an inch Sir of red sealwax

When this is melted and dropped upon the letter if Dolly fumbles too
long for her thimble till the wax is over hardened it will not receive
the mark of her thimble from the usual impulse which was wont to imprint
it Very well If Dollys wax for want of better is beeswax or of a
temper too softtho it may receiveit will not hold the impression
how hard soever Dolly thrusts against it and last of all supposing the
wax good and eke the thimble but applied thereto in careless haste as
her Mistress rings the bellin any one of these three cases the print
left by the thimble will be as unlike the prototype as a brassjack

Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the
confusion in my uncle Tobys discourse and it is for that very reason
I enlarge upon them so long after the manner of great physiologiststo
shew the world what it did not arise from

What it did arise from I have hinted above and a fertile source of
obscurity it isand ever will beand that is the unsteady uses
of words which have perplexed the clearest and most exalted
understandings

It is ten to one at Arthurs whether you have ever read the literary
histories of past agesif you have what terrible battles yclept
logomachies have they occasioned and perpetuated with so much gall
and inkshedthat a goodnatured man cannot read the accounts of them
without tears in his eyes

Gentle critick when thou hast weighed all this and considered within
thyself how much of thy own knowledge discourse and conversation has
been pestered and disordered at one time or other by this and this
onlyWhat a pudder and racket in Councils about Greek and in the
Schools of the learned about power and about spiritabout essences
and about quintessencesabout substances and about spaceWhat
confusion in greater Theatres from words of little meaning and as
indeterminate a sense when thou considerest this thou wilt not wonder
at my uncle Tobys perplexitiesthou wilt drop a tear of pity upon
his scarp and his counterscarphis glacis and his covered wayhis
ravelin and his halfmoon Twas not by ideasby Heaven his life was
put in jeopardy by words



Chapter 1XXVIII

When my uncle Toby got his map of Namur to his mind he began
immediately to apply himself and with the utmost diligence to the
study of it for nothing being of more importance to him than his
recovery and his recovery depending as you have read upon the
passions and affections of his mind it behoved him to take the nicest
care to make himself so far master of his subject as to be able to talk
upon it without emotion

In a fortnights close and painful application which by the bye did
my uncle Tobys wound upon his groin no goodhe was enabled by the
help of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant together
with Gobesiuss military architecture and pyroballogy translated from
the Flemish to form his discourse with passable perspicuity and before
he was two full months gonehe was right eloquent upon it and
could make not only the attack of the advanced counterscarp with great
orderbut having by that time gone much deeper into the art than
what his first motive made necessary my uncle Toby was able to cross
the Maes and Sambre make diversions as far as Vaubans line the abbey
of Salsines c and give his visitors as distinct a history of each of
their attacks as of that of the gate of St Nicolas where he had the
honour to receive his wound

But desire of knowledge like the thirst of riches increases ever with
the acquisition of it The more my uncle Toby pored over his map
the more he took a liking to itby the same process and electrical
assimilation as I told you through which I ween the souls of
connoisseurs themselves by long friction and incumbition have the
happiness at length to get all bevirtudbepicturedbe
butterflied and befiddled

The more my uncle Toby drank of this sweet fountain of science the
greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst so that before the
first year of his confinement had well gone round there was scarce a
fortified town in Italy or Flanders of which by one means or other
he had not procured a plan reading over as he got them and carefully
collating therewith the histories of their sieges their demolitions
their improvements and new works all which he would read with that
intense application and delight that he would forget himself his
wound his confinement his dinner

In the second year my uncle Toby purchased Ramelli and Cataneo
translated from the Italianlikewise Stevinus Moralis the Chevalier
de Ville Lorini Cochorn Sheeter the Count de Pagan the Marshal
Vauban Mons Blondel with almost as many more books of military
architecture as Don Quixote was found to have of chivalry when the
curate and barber invaded his library

Towards the beginning of the third year which was in August
ninetynine my uncle Toby found it necessary to understand a little of
projectilesand having judged it best to draw his knowledge from the
fountainhead he began with N Tartaglia who it seems was the first
man who detected the imposition of a cannonballs doing all that
mischief under the notion of a right lineThis N Tartaglia proved to
my uncle Toby to be an impossible thing

Endless is the search of Truth

No sooner was my uncle Toby satisfied which road the cannonball did not
go but he was insensibly led on and resolved in his mind to enquire
and find out which road the ball did go For which purpose he was
obliged to set off afresh with old Maltus and studied him devoutlyHe
proceeded next to Galileo and Torricellius wherein by certain
Geometrical rules infallibly laid down he found the precise path to
be a Parabolaor else an Hyperbolaand that the parameter or latus
rectum of the conic section of the said path was to the quantity and
amplitude in a direct ratio as the whole line to the sine of double the
angle of incidence formed by the breech upon an horizontal planeand
that the semiparameterstop my dear uncle Tobystopgo not one
foot farther into this thorny and bewildered trackintricate are the
steps intricate are the mazes of this labyrinth intricate are the
troubles which the pursuit of this bewitching phantom Knowledge

Chapter 1XXIX

I would not give a groat for that mans knowledge in pencraft who does
not understand thisThat the best plain narrative in the world tacked
very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my uncle Tobywould
have felt both cold and vapid upon the readers palatetherefore I
forthwith put an end to the chapter though I was in the middle of my
story

Writers of my stamp have one principle in common with painters Where
an exact copying makes our pictures less striking we choose the less
evil deeming it even more pardonable to trespass against truth than
beauty This is to be understood cum grano salis but be it as it
willas the parallel is made more for the sake of letting the
apostrophe cool than any thing elsetis not very material whether
upon any other score the reader approves of it or not

In the latter end of the third year my uncle Toby perceiving that the
parameter and semiparameter of the conic section angered his wound
he left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a huff and betook
himself to the practical part of fortification only the pleasure of
which like a spring held back returned upon him with redoubled force

It was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily
regularity of a clean shirtto dismiss his barber unshavenand to
allow his surgeon scarce time sufficient to dress his wound concerning
himself so little about it as not to ask him once in seven times
dressing how it went on when loall of a sudden for the change
was quick as lightning he began to sigh heavily for his
recoverycomplained to my father grew impatient with the
surgeonand one morning as he heard his foot coming up stairs
he shut up his books and thrust aside his instruments in order to
expostulate with him upon the protraction of the cure which he told
him might surely have been accomplished at least by that timeHe
dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone and the sorrows of his
four years melancholy imprisonmentadding that had it not been for
the kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of brothershe
had long since sunk under his misfortunesMy father was by My uncle
Tobys eloquence brought tears into his eyestwas unexpectedMy
uncle Toby by nature was not eloquentit had the greater effectThe
surgeon was confoundednot that there wanted grounds for such or
greater marks of impatiencebut twas unexpected too in the four
years he had attended him he had never seen any thing like it in
my uncle Tobys carriage he had never once dropped one fretful or
discontented wordhe had been all patienceall submission

We lose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing itbut we
often treble the forceThe surgeon was astonished but much more so
when he heard my uncle Toby go on and peremptorily insist upon his
healing up the wound directlyor sending for Monsieur Ronjat the
kings serjeantsurgeon to do it for him

The desire of life and health is implanted in mans naturethe love of
liberty and enlargement is a sisterpassion to it These my uncle Toby
had in common with his speciesand either of them had been sufficient
to account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doorsbut
I have told you before that nothing wrought with our family after the
common wayand from the time and manner in which this eager desire
shewed itself in the present case the penetrating reader will suspect
there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle Tobys
headThere was so and tis the subject of the next chapter to set
forth what that cause and crotchet was I own when thats done twill
be time to return back to the parlour fireside where we left my uncle
Toby in the middle of his sentence



Chapter 1XXX

When a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling passionor
in other words when his HobbyHorse grows headstrongfarewell cool
reason and fair discretion

My uncle Tobys wound was near well and as soon as the surgeon
recovered his surprize and could get leave to say as muchhe told
him twas just beginning to incarnate and that if no fresh exfoliation
happened which there was no sign ofit would be dried up in five or
six weeks The sound of as many Olympiads twelve hours before would
have conveyed an idea of shorter duration to my uncle Tobys mindThe
succession of his ideas was now rapidhe broiled with impatience to
put his design in executionand so without consulting farther with
any soul livingwhich by the bye I think is right when you are
predetermined to take no one souls advicehe privately ordered
Trim his man to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings and hire a
chariotandfour to be at the door exactly by twelve oclock that day
when he knew my father would be upon ChangeSo leaving a banknote
upon the table for the surgeons care of him and a letter of
tender thanks for his brothershe packed up his maps his books of
fortification his instruments c and by the help of a crutch on one
side and Trim on the othermy uncle Toby embarked for ShandyHall

The reason or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as
follows

The table in my uncle Tobys room and at which the night before this
change happened he was sitting with his maps c about himbeing
somewhat of the smallest for that infinity of great and small
instruments of knowledge which usually lay crowded upon ithe had
the accident in reaching over for his tobaccobox to throw down his
compasses and in stooping to take the compasses up with his sleeve he
threw down his case of instruments and snuffersand as the dice took
a run against him in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers in
fallinghe thrust Monsieur Blondel off the table and Count de Pagon
otop of him

Twas to no purpose for a man lame as my uncle Toby was to think
of redressing these evils by himselfhe rung his bell for his man
TrimTrim quoth my uncle Toby prithee see what confusion I have here
been makingI must have some better contrivance TrimCanst not thou
take my rule and measure the length and breadth of this table and
then go and bespeak me one as big againYes an please your Honour
replied Trim making a bow but I hope your Honour will be soon well
enough to get down to your countryseat whereas your Honour takes so
much pleasure in fortification we could manage this matter to a T

I must here inform you that this servant of my uncle Tobys who went
by the name of Trim had been a corporal in my uncles own companyhis
real name was James Butlerbut having got the nickname of Trim in
the regiment my uncle Toby unless when he happened to be very angry
with him would never call him by any other name

The poor fellow had been disabled for the service by a wound on his
left knee by a musketbullet at the battle of Landen which was two
years before the affair of Namurand as the fellow was wellbeloved
in the regiment and a handy fellow into the bargain my uncle Toby took
him for his servant and of an excellent use was he attending my uncle
Toby in the camp and in his quarters as a valet groom barber cook
sempster and nurse and indeed from first to last waited upon him and
served him with great fidelity and affection

My uncle Toby loved the man in return and what attached him more to him
still was the similitude of their knowledgeFor Corporal Trim for
so for the future I shall call him by four years occasional attention
to his Masters discourse upon fortified towns and the advantage of
prying and peeping continually into his Masters plans c exclusive
and besides what he gained HobbyHorsically as a bodyservant Non
Hobby Horsical per sehad become no mean proficient in the science
and was thought by the cook and chambermaid to know as much of the
nature of strongholds as my uncle Toby himself

I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal Trims
characterand it is the only dark line in itThe fellow loved to
adviseor rather to hear himself talk his carriage however was so
perfectly respectful twas easy to keep him silent when you had him
so but set his tongue agoingyou had no hold of himhe was
volublethe eternal interlardings of your Honour with the
respectfulness of Corporal Trims manner interceding so strong
in behalf of his elocutionthat though you might have been
incommodedyou could not well be angry My uncle Toby was seldom
either the one or the other with himor at least this fault in
Trim broke no squares with them My uncle Toby as I said loved the
manand besides as he ever looked upon a faithful servantbut as an
humble friendhe could not bear to stop his mouthSuch was Corporal
Trim

If I durst presume continued Trim to give your Honour my advice and
speak my opinion in this matterThou art welcome Trim quoth my uncle
Tobyspeakspeak what thou thinkest upon the subject man without
fearWhy then replied Trim not hanging his ears and scratching his
head like a countrylout but stroking his hair back from his forehead
and standing erect as before his divisionI think quoth Trim
advancing his left which was his lame leg a little forwardsand
pointing with his right hand open towards a map of Dunkirk which was
pinned against the hangingsI think quoth Corporal Trim with humble
submission to your Honours better judgmentthat these ravelins
bastions curtins and hornworks make but a poor contemptible
fiddlefaddle piece of work of it here upon paper compared to what your
Honour and I could make of it were we in the country by ourselves and
had but a rood or a rood and a half of ground to do what we pleased
with As summer is coming on continued Trim your Honour might sit
out of doors and give me the nographyCall it ichnography quoth my
uncleof the town or citadel your Honour was pleased to sit down
beforeand I will be shot by your Honour upon the glacis of it if
I did not fortify it to your Honours mindI dare say thou wouldst
Trim quoth my uncleFor if your Honour continued the Corporal could
but mark me the polygon with its exact lines and anglesThat I could
do very well quoth my uncleI would begin with the fosse and if your
Honour could tell me the proper depth and breadthI can to a hairs
breadth Trim replied my uncleI would throw out the earth upon
this hand towards the town for the scarpand on that hand towards
the campaign for the counterscarpVery right Trim quoth my uncle
TobyAnd when I had sloped them to your mindan please your Honour
I would face the glacis as the finest fortifications are done in
Flanders with sodsand as your Honour knows they should beand I
would make the walls and parapets with sods tooThe best engineers
call them gazons Trim said my uncle TobyWhether they are gazons or
sods is not much matter replied Trim your Honour knows they are ten
times beyond a facing either of brick or stoneI know they are
Trim in some respectsquoth my uncle Toby nodding his headfor a
cannonball enters into the gazon right onwards without bringing any
rubbish down with it which might fill the fosse as was the case at
St Nicolass gate and facilitate the passage over it

Your Honour understands these matters replied Corporal Trim better
than any officer in his Majestys servicebut would your Honour please
to let the bespeaking of the table alone and let us but go into the
country I would work under your Honours directions like a horse
and make fortifications for you something like a tansy with all their
batteries saps ditches and palisadoes that it should be worth all
the worlds riding twenty miles to go and see it

My uncle Toby blushed as red as scarlet as Trim went onbut it was not
a blush of guiltof modestyor of angerit was a blush of joyhe
was fired with Corporal Trims project and descriptionTrim said
my uncle Toby thou hast said enoughWe might begin the campaign
continued Trim on the very day that his Majesty and the Allies take the
field and demolish them town by town as fast asTrim quoth my uncle
Toby say no more Your Honour continued Trim might sit in your
armchair pointing to it this fine weather giving me your orders and
I wouldSay no more Trim quoth my uncle TobyBesides your Honour
would get not only pleasure and good pastimebut good air and good
exercise and good healthand your Honours wound would be well in a
month Thou hast said enough Trimquoth my uncle Toby putting his
hand into his breechespocketI like thy project mightilyAnd if
your Honour pleases Ill this moment go and buy a pioneers spade
to take down with us and Ill bespeak a shovel and a pickaxe and a
couple ofSay no more Trim quoth my uncle Toby leaping up upon one
leg quite overcome with raptureand thrusting a guinea into Trims
handTrim said my uncle Toby say no morebut go down Trim this
moment my lad and bring up my supper this instant

Trim ran down and brought up his masters supperto no
purposeTrims plan of operation ran so in my uncle Tobys head he
could not taste itTrim quoth my uncle Toby get me to bedTwas
all oneCorporal Trims description had fired his imaginationmy
uncle Toby could not shut his eyesThe more he considered it the more
bewitching the scene appeared to himso that two full hours before
daylight he had come to a final determination and had concerted the
whole plan of his and Corporal Trims decampment

My uncle Toby had a little neat countryhouse of his own in the village
where my fathers estate lay at Shandy which had been left him by
an old uncle with a small estate of about one hundred pounds ayear
Behind this house and contiguous to it was a kitchengarden of about
half an acre and at the bottom of the garden and cut off from it by
a tall yew hedge was a bowlinggreen containing just about as much
ground as Corporal Trim wished forso that as Trim uttered the
words A rood and a half of ground to do what they would withthis
identical bowlinggreen instantly presented itself and became curiously
painted all at once upon the retina of my uncle Tobys fancywhich
was the physical cause of making him change colour or at least of
heightening his blush to that immoderate degree I spoke of

Never did lover post down to a beloved mistress with more heat and
expectation than my uncle Toby did to enjoy this selfsame thing in
privateI say in privatefor it was sheltered from the house as I
told you by a tall yew hedge and was covered on the other three sides
from mortal sight by rough holly and thickset flowering shrubsso
that the idea of not being seen did not a little contribute to the
idea of pleasure preconceived in my uncle Tobys mindVain thought
however thick it was planted aboutor private soever it might
seemto think dear uncle Toby of enjoying a thing which took up a
whole rood and a half of groundand not have it known

How my uncle Toby and Corporal Trim managed this matterwith the
history of their campaigns which were no way barren of eventsmay
make no uninteresting underplot in the epitasis and workingup of this
dramaAt present the scene must dropand change for the parlour
fireside



Chapter 1XXXI

What can they be doing brother said my fatherI think replied
my uncle Tobytaking as I told you his pipe from his mouth and
striking the ashes out of it as he began his sentenceI think replied
heit would not be amiss brother if we rung the bell

Pray whats all that racket over our heads Obadiahquoth my
fathermy brother and I can scarce hear ourselves speak

Sir answered Obadiah making a bow towards his left shouldermy
Mistress is taken very badlyAnd wheres Susannah running down the
garden there as if they were going to ravish herSir she is running
the shortest cut into the town replied Obadiah to fetch the old
midwifeThen saddle a horse quoth my father and do you go directly
for Dr Slop the manmidwife with all our servicesand let him know
your mistress is fallen into labourand that I desire he will return
with you with all speed

It is very strange says my father addressing himself to my uncle Toby
as Obadiah shut the dooras there is so expert an operator as Dr Slop
so nearthat my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate
humour of hers in trusting the life of my child who has had one
misfortune already to the ignorance of an old womanand not only the
life of my child brotherbut her own life and with it the lives of
all the children I might peradventure have begot out of her hereafter

Mayhap brother replied my uncle Toby my sister does it to save the
expenceA puddings endreplied my fatherthe Doctor must be paid
the same for inaction as actionif not betterto keep him in temper

Then it can be out of nothing in the whole world quoth my uncle Toby
in the simplicity of his heartbut ModestyMy sister I dare say
added he does not care to let a man come so near her I will not say
whether my uncle Toby had completed the sentence or nottis for his
advantage to suppose he hadas I think he could have added no One
Word which would have improved it

If on the contrary my uncle Toby had not fully arrived at the periods
endthen the world stands indebted to the sudden snapping of my
fathers tobaccopipe for one of the neatest examples of that ornamental
figure in oratory which Rhetoricians stile the AposiopesisJust
Heaven how does the Poco piu and the Poco meno of the Italian
artiststhe insensible more or less determine the precise line of
beauty in the sentence as well as in the statue How do the slight
touches of the chisel the pencil the pen the fiddlestick et
caeteragive the true swell which gives the true pleasureO my
countrymenbe nice be cautious of your language and never O never
let it be forgotten upon what small particles your eloquence and your
fame depend

My sister mayhap quoth my uncle Toby does not choose to let a
man come so near her Make this dashtis an AposiopesisTake
the dash away and write Backsidetis BawdyScratch Backside
out and put Coverd way in tis a Metaphorand I dare say as
fortification ran so much in my uncle Tobys head that if he had been
left to have added one word to the sentencethat word was it

But whether that was the case or not the caseor whether the snapping
of my fathers tobaccopipe so critically happened through accident or
anger will be seen in due time



Chapter 1XXXII

Tho my father was a good natural philosopheryet he was something of
a moral philosopher too for which reason when his tobaccopipe snappd
short in the middlehe had nothing to do as such but to have taken
hold of the two pieces and thrown them gently upon the back of the
fireHe did no such thinghe threw them with all the violence in the
worldand to give the action still more emphasishe started upon
both his legs to do it

This looked something like heatand the manner of his reply to what my
uncle Toby was saying proved it was so

Not choose quoth my father repeating my uncle Tobys words to
let a man come so near herBy Heaven brother Toby you would try the
patience of Joband I think I have the plagues of one already without
itWhyWhereWhereinWhereforeUpon what account replied my
uncle Toby in the utmost astonishmentTo think said my father of a
man living to your age brother and knowing so little about womenI
know nothing at all about themreplied my uncle Toby And I think
continued he that the shock I received the year after the demolition of
Dunkirk in my affair with widow Wadmanwhich shock you know I should
not have received but from my total ignorance of the sexhas given me
just cause to say That I neither know nor do pretend to know any thing
about em or their concerns eitherMethinks brother replied my
father you might at least know so much as the right end of a woman
from the wrong

It is said in Aristotles Master Piece That when a man doth think of
any thing which is pasthe looketh down upon the groundbut that
when he thinketh of something that is to come he looketh up towards the
heavens

My uncle Toby I suppose thought of neither for he lookd
horizontallyRight end quoth my uncle Toby muttering the two words
low to himself and fixing his two eyes insensibly as he muttered them
upon a small crevice formed by a bad joint in the chimneypieceRight
end of a womanI declare quoth my uncle I know no more which it is
than the man in the moonand if I was to think continued my uncle
Toby keeping his eyes still fixed upon the bad joint this month
together I am sure I should not be able to find it out

Then brother Toby replied my father I will tell you

Every thing in this world continued my father filling a fresh
pipeevery thing in this world my dear brother Toby has two
handlesNot always quoth my uncle TobyAt least replied my father
every one has two handswhich comes to the same thingNow if a man
was to sit down coolly and consider within himself the make the shape
the construction comeatability and convenience of all the parts
which constitute the whole of that animal called Woman and compare
them analogicallyI never understood rightly the meaning of that
wordquoth my uncle Toby

Analogy replied my father is the certain relation and agreement
which differentHere a devil of a rap at the door snapped my fathers
definition like his tobaccopipe in twoand at the same time
crushed the head of as notable and curious a dissertation as ever was
engendered in the womb of speculationit was some months before my
father could get an opportunity to be safely delivered of itAnd at
this hour it is a thing full as problematical as the subject of the
dissertation itselfconsidering the confusion and distresses of our
domestick misadventures which are now coming thick one upon the back
of another whether I shall be able to find a place for it in the third
volume or not



Chapter 1XXXIII

It is about an hour and a halfs tolerable good reading since my uncle
Toby rung the bell when Obadiah was ordered to saddle a horse and go
for Dr Slop the manmidwifeso that no one can say with reason
that I have not allowed Obadiah time enough poetically speaking and
considering the emergency too both to go and comethough morally and
truly speaking the man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots

If the hypercritick will go upon this and is resolved after all to take
a pendulum and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the
bell and the rap at the doorand after finding it to be no more than
two minutes thirteen seconds and threefifthsshould take upon him
to insult over me for such a breach in the unity or rather probability
of timeI would remind him that the idea of duration and of its
simple modes is got merely from the train and succession of our
ideasand is the true scholastic pendulumand by which as a scholar
I will be tried in this matterabjuring and detesting the jurisdiction
of all other pendulums whatever

I would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles
from ShandyHall to Dr Slop the manmidwifes houseand that whilst
Obadiah has been going those said miles and back I have brought my
uncle Toby from Namur quite across all Flanders into EnglandThat
I have had him ill upon my hands near four yearsand have since
travelled him and Corporal Trim in a chariotandfour a journey of near
two hundred miles down into Yorkshireall which put together must
have prepared the readers imagination for the entrance of Dr Slop upon
the stageas much at least I hope as a dance a song or a concerto
between the acts

If my hypercritick is intractable alledging that two minutes
and thirteen seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen
secondswhen I have said all I can about them and that this plea
though it might save me dramatically will damn me biographically
rendering my book from this very moment a professed Romance which
before was a book apocryphalIf I am thus pressedI then put an
end to the whole objection and controversy about it all at onceby
acquainting him that Obadiah had not got above threescore yards from
the stableyard before he met with Dr Slopand indeed he gave a
dirty proof that he had met with him and was within an ace of giving a
tragical one too

Imagine to yourselfbut this had better begin a new chapter



Chapter 1XXXIV

Imagine to yourself a little squat uncourtly figure of a Doctor Slop
of about four feet and a half perpendicular height with a breadth of
back and a sesquipedality of belly which might have done honour to a
serjeant in the horseguards

Such were the outlines of Dr Slops figure whichif you have
read Hogarths analysis of beauty and if you have not I wish you
wouldyou must know may as certainly be caricatured and conveyed to
the mind by three strokes as three hundred

Imagine such a onefor such I say were the outlines of Dr Slops
figure coming slowly along foot by foot waddling thro the dirt upon
the vertebrae of a little diminutive pony of a pretty colourbut of
strengthalackscarce able to have made an amble of it under such
a fardel had the roads been in an ambling conditionThey were
notImagine to yourself Obadiah mounted upon a strong monster of
a coachhorse pricked into a full gallop and making all practicable
speed the adverse way

Pray Sir let me interest you a moment in this description

Had Dr Slop beheld Obadiah a mile off posting in a narrow lane
directly towards him at that monstrous ratesplashing and plunging
like a devil thro thick and thin as he approached would not such a
phaenomenon with such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it
round its axishave been a subject of juster apprehension to Dr Slop
in his situation than the worst of Whistons cometsTo say nothing of
the Nucleus that is of Obadiah and the coachhorseIn my idea the
vortex alone of em was enough to have involved and carried if not the
doctor at least the doctors pony quite away with it What then do you
think must the terror and hydrophobia of Dr Slop have been when you
read which you are just going to do that he was advancing thus warily
along towards ShandyHall and had approached to within sixty yards of
it and within five yards of a sudden turn made by an acute angle
of the gardenwalland in the dirtiest part of a dirty
lanewhen Obadiah and his coachhorse turned the corner rapid
furiouspopfull upon himNothing I think in nature can be
supposed more terrible than such a rencounterso imprompt so ill
prepared to stand the shock of it as Dr Slop was

What could Dr Slop dohe crossed himself  Pughbut the doctor
Sir was a PapistNo matter he had better have kept hold of the
pummelHe had sonay as it happened he had better have done
nothing at all for in crossing himself he let go his whipand in
attempting to save his whip betwixt his knee and his saddles skirt as
it slipped he lost his stirrupin losing which he lost his seatand
in the multitude of all these losses which by the bye shews what
little advantage there is in crossing the unfortunate doctor lost his
presence of mind So that without waiting for Obadiahs onset he left
his pony to its destiny tumbling off it diagonally something in the
stile and manner of a pack of wool and without any other consequence
from the fall save that of being left as it would have been with the
broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire

Obadiah pulld off his cap twice to Dr Sloponce as he was
fallingand then again when he saw him seatedIlltimed
complaisancehad not the fellow better have stopped his horse and
got off and helpd himSir he did all that his situation would
allowbut the Momentum of the coachhorse was so great that Obadiah
could not do it all at once he rode in a circle three times round Dr
Slop before he could fully accomplish it any howand at the last
when he did stop his beast twas done with such an explosion of mud
that Obadiah had better have been a league off In short never was a
Dr Slop so beluted and so transubstantiated since that affair came
into fashion



Chapter 1XXXV

When Dr Slop entered the back parlour where my father and my uncle
Toby were discoursing upon the nature of womenit was hard to
determine whether Dr Slops figure or Dr Slops presence occasioned
more surprize to them for as the accident happened so near the house
as not to make it worth while for Obadiah to remount himObadiah had
led him in as he was unwiped unappointed unannealed with all his
stains and blotches on himHe stood like Hamlets ghost motionless
and speechless for a full minute and a half at the parlourdoor
Obadiah still holding his hand with all the majesty of mud His hinder
parts upon which he had received his fall totally besmearedand in
every other part of him blotched over in such a manner with Obadiahs
explosion that you would have sworn without mental reservation that
every grain of it had taken effect

Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle Toby to have triumphed over
my father in his turnfor no mortal who had beheld Dr Slop in that
pickle could have dissented from so much at least of my uncle Tobys
opinion That mayhap his sister might not care to let such a Dr Slop
come so near her But it was the Argumentum ad hominem and if my
uncle Toby was not very expert at it you may think he might not care
to use itNo the reason wastwas not his nature to insult

Dr Slops presence at that time was no less problematical than the
mode of it tho it is certain one moments reflexion in my father
might have solved it for he had apprized Dr Slop but the week before
that my mother was at her full reckoning and as the doctor had heard
nothing since twas natural and very political too in him to have
taken a ride to ShandyHall as he did merely to see how matters went
on

But my fathers mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the
investigation running like the hypercriticks altogether upon
the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the doormeasuring their
distance and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation as to have
power to think of nothing elsecommonplace infirmity of the greatest
mathematicians working with might and main at the demonstration and so
wasting all their strength upon it that they have none left in them to
draw the corollary to do good with

The ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door struck likewise
strong upon the sensorium of my uncle Tobybut it excited a very
different train of thoughtsthe two irreconcileable pulsations
instantly brought Stevinus the great engineer along with them into
my uncle Tobys mind What business Stevinus had in this affairis
the greatest problem of allIt shall be solvedbut not in the next
chapter



Chapter 1XXXVI

Writing when properly managed as you may be sure I think mine is is
but a different name for conversation As no one who knows what he is
about in good company would venture to talk allso no author who
understands the just boundaries of decorum and goodbreeding would
presume to think all The truest respect which you can pay to the
readers understanding is to halve this matter amicably and leave him
something to imagine in his turn as well as yourself

For my own part I am eternally paying him compliments of this kind and
do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own

Tis his turn nowI have given an ample description of Dr Slops
sad overthrow and of his sad appearance in the backparlourhis
imagination must now go on with it for a while

Let the reader imagine then that Dr Slop has told his taleand in

suppose that Obadiah has told his tale also and with such rueful looks

Chapter 1XXXVII

Your sudden and unexpected arrival quoth my uncle Toby addressing
himself to Dr Slop all three of them sitting down to the fire
together as my uncle Toby began to speakinstantly brought the great
Stevinus into my head who you must know is a favourite author with
meThen added my father making use of the argument Ad CrumenamI
will lay twenty guineas to a single crownpiece which will serve to
give away to Obadiah when he gets back that this same Stevinus was some
engineer or otheror has wrote something or other either directly or
indirectly upon the science of fortification

He has soreplied my uncle TobyI knew it said my father though
for the soul of me I cannot see what kind of connection there can
be betwixt Dr Slops sudden coming and a discourse upon
fortificationyet I feard itTalk of what we will brotheror let
the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for the subjectyou are
sure to bring it in I would not brother Toby continued my
fatherI declare I would not have my head so full of curtins and
hornworksThat I dare say you would not quoth Dr Slop interrupting
him and laughing most immoderately at his pun

Dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun or the insinuation
of a pun more cordially than my fatherhe would grow testy upon it at
any timebut to be broke in upon by one in a serious discourse was
as bad he would say as a fillip upon the nosehe saw no difference

Sir quoth my uncle Toby addressing himself to Dr Slopthe
curtins my brother Shandy mentions here have nothing to do with
beadsteadstho I know Du Cange says That bedcurtains in all
probability have taken their name from themnor have the hornworks
he speaks of any thing in the world to do with the hornworks of
cuckoldom But the Curtin Sir is the word we use in fortification for
that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and
joins themBesiegers seldom offer to carry on their attacks directly
against the curtin for this reason because they are so well flanked
Tis the case of other curtains quoth Dr Slop laughing However
continued my uncle Toby to make them sure we generally choose to place
ravelins before them taking care only to extend them beyond the fosse
or ditchThe common men who know very little of fortification
confound the ravelin and the halfmoon togethertho they are very
different thingsnot in their figure or construction for we make
them exactly alike in all points for they always consist of two faces
making a salient angle with the gorges not straight but in form of
a crescentWhere then lies the difference quoth my father a little
testilyIn their situations answered my uncle TobyFor when a
ravelin brother stands before the curtin it is a ravelin and when a
ravelin stands before a bastion then the ravelin is not a ravelinit
is a halfmoona halfmoon likewise is a halfmoon and no more so
long as it stands before its bastionbut was it to change place and
get before the curtintwould be no longer a halfmoon a halfmoon
in that case is not a halfmoontis no more than a ravelinI
think quoth my father that the noble science of defence has its weak
sidesas well as others

As for the hornwork high ho sighd my father which continued my
uncle Toby my brother was speaking of they are a very considerable
part of an outworkthey are called by the French engineers Ouvrage a
corne and we generally make them to cover such places as we suspect
to be weaker than the resttis formed by two epaulments or
demibastionsthey are very prettyand if you will take a walk Ill
engage to shew you one well worth your troubleI own continued my
uncle Toby when we crown themthey are much stronger but then they
are very expensive and take up a great deal of ground so that in my
opinion they are most of use to cover or defend the head of a camp
otherwise the double tenailleBy the mother who bore usbrother Toby
quoth my father not able to hold out any longeryou would provoke a
sainthere have you got us I know not how not only souse into the
middle of the old subject againBut so full is your head of these
confounded works that though my wife is this moment in the pains of
labour and you hear her cry out yet nothing will serve you but to
carry off the manmidwifeAccoucheurif you please quoth Dr
SlopWith all my heart replied my father I dont care what they
call youbut I wish the whole science of fortification with all its
inventors at the devilit has been the death of thousandsand it
will be mine in the endI would not I would not brother Toby
have my brains so full of saps mines blinds gabions pallisadoes
ravelins halfmoons and such trumpery to be proprietor of Namur and
of all the towns in Flanders with it

My uncle Toby was a man patient of injuriesnot from want of
courageI have told you in a former chapter that he was a man of
courageAnd will add here that where just occasions presented or
called it forthI know no man under whose arm I would have sooner
taken shelternor did this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness
of his intellectual partsfor he felt this insult of my fathers
as feelingly as a man could dobut he was of a peaceful placid
natureno jarring element in itall was mixed up so kindly within
him my uncle Toby had scarce a heart to retaliate upon a fly

Gosays he one day at dinner to an overgrown one which had buzzed
about his nose and tormented him cruelly all dinnertimeand which
after infinite attempts he had caught at last as it flew by himIll
not hurt thee says my uncle Toby rising from his chair and going
across the room with the fly in his handIll not hurt a hair of
thy headGo says he lifting up the sash and opening his hand as he
spoke to let it escapego poor devil get thee gone why should I
hurt theeThis world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me

I was but ten years old when this happened but whether it was that the
action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age of pity which
instantly set my whole frame into one vibration of most pleasurable
sensationor how far the manner and expression of it might go towards
itor in what degree or by what secret magicka tone of voice and
harmony of movement attuned by mercy might find a passage to my heart
I know notthis I know that the lesson of universal goodwill then
taught and imprinted by my uncle Toby has never since been worn out of
my mind And tho I would not depreciate what the study of the Literae
humaniores at the university have done for me in that respect or
discredit the other helps of an expensive education bestowed upon me
both at home and abroad sinceyet I often think that I owe one half of
my philanthropy to that one accidental impression

This is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole volume
upon the subject

I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle Tobys picture by
the instrument with which I drew the other parts of itthat taking in
no more than the mere HobbyHorsical likenessthis is a part of his
moral character My father in this patient endurance of wrongs which I
mention was very different as the reader must long ago have noted he
had a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature attended with a
little soreness of temper tho this never transported him to any thing
which looked like malignancyyet in the little rubs and vexations
of life twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of
peevishnessHe was however frank and generous in his natureat all
times open to conviction and in the little ebullitions of this subacid
humour towards others but particularly towards my uncle Toby whom he
truly lovedhe would feel more pain ten times told except in the
affair of my aunt Dinah or where an hypothesis was concerned than what
he ever gave

The characters of the two brothers in this view of them reflected
light upon each other and appeared with great advantage in this affair
which arose about Stevinus

I need not tell the reader if he keeps a HobbyHorsethat a mans
HobbyHorse is as tender a part as he has about him and that
these unprovoked strokes at my uncle Tobys could not be unfelt by
himNoas I said above my uncle Toby did feel them and very
sensibly too

Pray Sir what said heHow did he behaveO Sirit was great For
as soon as my father had done insulting his HobbyHorsehe turned his
head without the least emotion from Dr Slop to whom he was addressing
his discourse and looking up into my fathers face with a countenance
spread over with so much goodnatureso placidso fraternalso
inexpressibly tender towards himit penetrated my father to his heart
He rose up hastily from his chair and seizing hold of both my
uncle Tobys hands as he spokeBrother Toby said heI beg thy
pardonforgive I pray thee this rash humour which my mother gave
meMy dear dear brother answered my uncle Toby rising up by my
fathers help say no more about ityou are heartily welcome had it
been ten times as much brother But tis ungenerous replied my father
to hurt any mana brother worsebut to hurt a brother of such gentle
mannersso unprovokingand so unresentingtis baseBy Heaven
tis cowardlyYou are heartily welcome brother quoth my uncle
Tobyhad it been fifty times as muchBesides what have I to do
my dear Toby cried my father either with your amusements or your
pleasures unless it was in my power which it is not to increase their
measure

Brother Shandy answered my uncle Toby looking wistfully in his
faceyou are much mistaken in this pointfor you do increase my
pleasure very much in begetting children for the Shandy family at your
time of lifeBut by that Sir quoth Dr Slop Mr Shandy increases
his ownNot a jot quoth my father



Chapter 1XXXVIII

My brother does it quoth my uncle Toby out of principleIn a family
way I suppose quoth Dr SlopPshawsaid my fathertis not worth
talking of



Chapter 1XXXIX

At the end of the last chapter my father and my uncle Toby were left
both standing like Brutus and Cassius at the close of the scene
making up their accounts

As my father spoke the three last wordshe sat downmy uncle Toby
exactly followed his example only that before he took his chair he
rung the bell to order Corporal Trim who was in waiting to step
home for Stevinusmy uncle Tobys house being no farther off than the
opposite side of the way

Some men would have dropped the subject of Stevinusbut my uncle Toby
had no resentment in his heart and he went on with the subject to shew
my father that he had none

Your sudden appearance Dr Slop quoth my uncle resuming the
discourse instantly brought Stevinus into my head My father you
may be sure did not offer to lay any more wagers upon Stevinuss
headBecause continued my uncle Toby the celebrated sailing
chariot which belonged to Prince Maurice and was of such wonderful
contrivance and velocity as to carry half a dozen people thirty German
miles in I dont know how few minuteswas invented by Stevinus that
great mathematician and engineer

You might have spared your servant the trouble quoth Dr Slop as the
fellow is lame of going for Stevinuss account of it because in my
return from Leyden thro the Hague I walked as far as Schevling which
is two long miles on purpose to take a view of it

Thats nothing replied my uncle Toby to what the learned Peireskius
did who walked a matter of five hundred miles reckoning from Paris to
Schevling and from Schevling to Paris back again in order to see it
and nothing else

Some men cannot bear to be outgone

The more fool Peireskius replied Dr Slop But mark twas out of no
contempt of Peireskius at allbut that Peireskiuss indefatigable
labour in trudging so far on foot out of love for the sciences reduced
the exploit of Dr Slop in that affair to nothingthe more fool
Peireskius said he againWhy soreplied my father taking his
brothers part not only to make reparation as fast as he could for the
insult he had given him which sat still upon my fathers mindbut
partly that my father began really to interest himself in the
discourseWhy sosaid he Why is Peireskius or any man else to be
abused for an appetite for that or any other morsel of sound knowledge
For notwithstanding I know nothing of the chariot in question continued
he the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head and tho
I cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has atchieved
ityet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones
be they what they will or it could not have answered at the rate my
brother mentions

It answered replied my uncle Toby as well if not better for as
Peireskius elegantly expresses it speaking of the velocity of its
motion Tam citus erat quam erat ventus which unless I have forgot my
Latin is that it was as swift as the wind itself

But pray Dr Slop quoth my father interrupting my uncle tho not
without begging pardon for it at the same time upon what principles was
this selfsame chariot set agoingUpon very pretty principles to
be sure replied Dr SlopAnd I have often wondered continued he
evading the question why none of our gentry who live upon large
plains like this of oursespecially they whose wives are not past
childbearing attempt nothing of this kind for it would not only
be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls to which the sex is
subjectif the wind only servedbut would be excellent good
husbandry to make use of the winds which cost nothing and which eat
nothing rather than horses which the devil take em both cost and
eat a great deal

For that very reason replied my father Because they cost nothing and
because they eat nothingthe scheme is badit is the consumption of
our products as well as the manufactures of them which gives bread to
the hungry circulates tradebrings in money and supports the value
of our landsand tho I own if I was a Prince I would
generously recompense the scientifick head which brought forth such
contrivancesyet I would as peremptorily suppress the use of them

My father here had got into his elementand was going on as
prosperously with his dissertation upon trade as my uncle Toby had
before upon his of fortificationbut to the loss of much sound
knowledge the destinies in the morning had decreed that no dissertation
of any kind should be spun by my father that dayfor as he opened his
mouth to begin the next sentence



Chapter 1XL

In popped Corporal Trim with StevinusBut twas too lateall the
discourse had been exhausted without him and was running into a new
channel

You may take the book home again Trim said my uncle Toby nodding to
him

But prithee Corporal quoth my father drollinglook first into it
and see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot in it

Corporal Trim by being in the service had learned to obeyand not to
remonstrateso taking the book to a sidetable and running over
the leaves An please your Honour said Trim I can see no such
thinghowever continued the Corporal drolling a little in his turn
Ill make sure work of it an please your Honourso taking hold of
the two covers of the book one in each hand and letting the leaves
fall down as he bent the covers back he gave the book a good sound
shake

There is something falling out however said Trim an please your
Honourbut it is not a chariot or any thing like onePrithee
Corporal said my father smiling what is it thenI think answered
Trim stooping to take it uptis more like a sermonfor it begins
with a text of scripture and the chapter and verseand then goes on
not as a chariot but like a sermon directly

The company smiled

I cannot conceive how it is possible quoth my uncle Toby for such a
thing as a sermon to have got into my Stevinus

I think tis a sermon replied Trimbut if it please your Honours
as it is a fair hand I will read you a pagefor Trim you must know
loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk

I have ever a strong propensity said my father to look into things
which cross my way by such strange fatalities as theseand as we
have nothing better to do at least till Obadiah gets back I shall be
obliged to you brother if Dr Slop has no objection to it to order
the Corporal to give us a page or two of itif he is as able to do it
as he seems willing An please your honour quoth Trim I officiated
two whole campaigns in Flanders as clerk to the chaplain of the
regimentHe can read it quoth my uncle Toby as well as I canTrim
I assure you was the best scholar in my company and should have had
the next halberd but for the poor fellows misfortune Corporal Trim
laid his hand upon his heart and made an humble bow to his master then
laying down his hat upon the floor and taking up the sermon in his
left hand in order to have his right at libertyhe advanced nothing
doubting into the middle of the room where he could best see and be
best seen by his audience



Chapter 1XLI

If you have any objectionsaid my father addressing himself to Dr
Slop Not in the least replied Dr Slopfor it does not appear on
which side of the question it is wroteit may be a composition of
a divine of our church as well as yoursso that we run equal
risquesTis wrote upon neither side quoth Trim for tis only upon
Conscience an please your Honours

Trims reason put his audience into good humourall but Dr Slop who
turning his head about towards Trim looked a little angry

Begin Trimand read distinctly quoth my fatherI will an
please your Honour replied the Corporal making a bow and bespeaking
attention with a slight movement of his right hand



Chapter 1XLII

But before the Corporal begins I must first give you a description
of his attitudeotherwise he will naturally stand represented by your
imagination in an uneasy posturestiffperpendiculardividing
the weight of his body equally upon both legshis eye fixed as if on
dutyhis look determinedclenching the sermon in his left hand like
his firelockIn a word you would be apt to paint Trim as if he was
standing in his platoon ready for actionHis attitude was as unlike
all this as you can conceive

He stood before them with his body swayed and bent forwards just so
far as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the plain of the
horizonwhich sound orators to whom I address this know very well to
be the true persuasive angle of incidencein any other angle you may
talk and preachtis certainand it is done every daybut with
what effectI leave the world to judge

The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to a
mathematical exactnessdoes it not shew us by the way how the arts
and sciences mutually befriend each other

How the duce Corporal Trim who knew not so much as an acute angle from
an obtuse one came to hit it so exactlyor whether it was chance or
nature or good sense or imitation c shall be commented upon in that
part of the cyclopaedia of arts and sciences where the instrumental
parts of the eloquence of the senate the pulpit and the bar the
coffeehouse the bedchamber and fireside fall under consideration

He stoodfor I repeat it to take the picture of him in at one view
with his body swayed and somewhat bent forwardshis right leg from
under him sustaining seveneighths of his whole weightthe foot of
his left leg the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude
advanced a littlenot laterally nor forwards but in a line betwixt
themhis knee bent but that not violentlybut so as to fall within
the limits of the line of beautyand I add of the line of science
toofor consider it had one eighth part of his body to bear upso
that in this case the position of the leg is determinedbecause the
foot could be no farther advanced or the knee more bent than what
would allow him mechanically to receive an eighth part of his whole
weight under it and to carry it too

This I recommend to paintersneed I addto oratorsI think not
for unless they practise itthey must fall upon their noses

So much for Corporal Trims body and legsHe held the sermon loosely
not carelessly in his left hand raised something above his stomach
and detached a little from his breasthis right arm falling
negligently by his side as nature and the laws of gravity ordered
itbut with the palm of it open and turned towards his audience ready
to aid the sentiment in case it stood in need

Corporal Trims eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony
with the other parts of himhe looked frankunconstrained
something assuredbut not bordering upon assurance

Let not the critic ask how Corporal Trim could come by all thisIve
told him it should be explainedbut so he stood before my father my
uncle Toby and Dr Slopso swayed his body so contrasted his limbs
and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figurea
statuary might have modelled from itnay I doubt whether the oldest
Fellow of a Collegeor the Hebrew Professor himself could have much
mended it

Trim made a bow and read as follows

The Sermon

Hebrews xiii 18

For we trust we have a good Conscience

TrustTrust we have a good conscience

Certainly Trim quoth my father interrupting him you give that
sentence a very improper accent for you curl up your nose man and
read it with such a sneering tone as if the Parson was going to abuse
the Apostle

He is an please your Honour replied Trim Pugh said my father
smiling

Sir quoth Dr Slop Trim is certainly in the right for the writer who
I perceive is a Protestant by the snappish manner in which he takes up
the apostle is certainly going to abuse himif this treatment of him
has not done it already But from whence replied my father have you
concluded so soon Dr Slop that the writer is of our churchfor
aught I can see yethe may be of any churchBecause answered Dr
Slop if he was of ourshe durst no more take such a licencethan
a bear by his beardIf in our communion Sir a man was to insult an
apostlea saintor even the paring of a saints nailhe would have
his eyes scratched outWhat by the saint quoth my uncle Toby No
replied Dr Slop he would have an old house over his head Pray is
the Inquisition an ancient building answered my uncle Toby or is it
a modern oneI know nothing of architecture replied Dr SlopAn
please your Honours quoth Trim the Inquisition is the vilestPrithee
spare thy description Trim I hate the very name of it said my
fatherNo matter for that answered Dr Slopit has its uses for
tho Im no great advocate for it yet in such a case as this he would
soon be taught better manners and I can tell him if he went on at that
rate would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains God help him
then quoth my uncle Toby Amen added Trim for Heaven above knows
I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in itI
never heard one word of it before said my uncle Toby hastilyHow
came he there TrimO Sir the story will make your heart bleedas
it has made mine a thousand timesbut it is too long to be told
nowyour Honour shall hear it from first to last some day when I am
working beside you in our fortificationsbut the short of the story
is thisThat my brother Tom went over a servant to Lisbonand then
married a Jews widow who kept a small shop and sold sausages which
somehow or other was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the
night out of his bed where he was lying with his wife and two small
children and carried directly to the Inquisition where God help him
continued Trim fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heartthe poor
honest lad lies confined at this hour he was as honest a soul added
Trim pulling out his handkerchief as ever blood warmed

The tears trickled down Trims cheeks faster than he could well wipe
them awayA dead silence in the room ensued for some minutesCertain
proof of pity

Come Trim quoth my father after he saw the poor fellows grief had
got a little ventread onand put this melancholy story out of thy
headI grieve that I interrupted thee but prithee begin the sermon
againfor if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse as thou
sayest I have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the
apostle has given

Corporal Trim wiped his face and returned his handkerchief into his
pocket and making a bow as he did ithe began again

The Sermon

Hebrews xiii 18

For we trust we have a good Conscience

Trust trust we have a good conscience Surely if there is any thing in
this life which a man may depend upon and to the knowledge of which he
is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence it must be
this very thingwhether he has a good conscience or no

I am positive I am right quoth Dr Slop

If a man thinks at all he cannot well be a stranger to the true state
of this accounthe must be privy to his own thoughts and desireshe
must remember his past pursuits and know certainly the true springs and
motives which in general have governed the actions of his life

I defy him without an assistant quoth Dr Slop

In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances and as the
wise man complains hardly do we guess aright at the things that are
upon the earth and with labour do we find the things that are before
us But here the mind has all the evidence and facts within herselfis
conscious of the web she has woveknows its texture and fineness and
the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several
designs which virtue or vice has planned before her

The language is good and I declare Trim reads very well quoth my
father

Nowas conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind
has within herself of this and the judgment either of approbation or
censure which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of
our lives tis plain you will say from the very terms of the
propositionwhenever this inward testimony goes against a man and he
stands selfaccused that he must necessarily be a guilty manAnd on
the contrary when the report is favourable on his side and his heart
condemns him notthat it is not a matter of trust as the apostle
intimates but a matter of certainty and fact that the conscience is
good and that the man must be good also

Then the apostle is altogether in the wrong I suppose quoth Dr Slop
and the Protestant divine is in the right Sir have patience replied
my father for I think it will presently appear that St Paul and the
Protestant divine are both of an opinionAs nearly so quoth Dr Slop
as east is to westbut this continued he lifting both hands comes
from the liberty of the press

It is no more at the worst replied my uncle Toby than the liberty of
the pulpit for it does not appear that the sermon is printed or ever
likely to be

Go on Trim quoth my father

At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case and I make
no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed
upon the mind of manthat did no such thing ever happen as that the
conscience of a man by long habits of sin might as the scripture
assures it may insensibly become hardand like some tender parts of
his body by much stress and continual hard usage lose by degrees that
nice sense and perception with which God and nature endowed itDid
this never happenor was it certain that selflove could never hang
the least bias upon the judgmentor that the little interests below
could rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions and
encompass them about with clouds and thick darknessCould no such
thing as favour and affection enter this sacred CourtDid Wit disdain
to take a bribe in itor was ashamed to shew its face as an advocate
for an unwarrantable enjoyment Or lastly were we assured that
Interest stood always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearingand that
Passion never got into the judgmentseat and pronounced sentence in the
stead of Reason which is supposed always to preside and determine upon
the caseWas this truly so as the objection must supposeno doubt
then the religious and moral state of a man would be exactly what he
himself esteemed itand the guilt or innocence of every mans life
could be known in general by no better measure than the degrees of
his own approbation and censure

I own in one case whenever a mans conscience does accuse him as it
seldom errs on that side that he is guiltyand unless in melancholy
and hypocondriac cases we may safely pronounce upon it that there is
always sufficient grounds for the accusation

But the converse of the proposition will not hold truenamely that
whenever there is guilt the conscience must accuse and if it does not
that a man is therefore innocentThis is not factSo that the common
consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administering
to himselfthat he thanks God his mind does not misgive him and that
consequently he has a good conscience because he hath a quiet oneis
fallaciousand as current as the inference is and as infallible as
the rule appears at first sight yet when you look nearer to it and try
the truth of this rule upon plain factsyou see it liable to so much
error from a false applicationthe principle upon which it goes so
often pervertedthe whole force of it lost and sometimes so vilely
cast away that it is painful to produce the common examples from human
life which confirm the account

A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his
principlesexceptionable in his conduct to the world shall live
shameless in the open commission of a sin which no reason or pretence
can justifya sin by which contrary to all the workings of humanity
he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guiltrob her of her
best dowry and not only cover her own head with dishonourbut involve
a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sake Surely you
will think conscience must lead such a man a troublesome life he can
have no rest night and day from its reproaches

Alas Conscience had something else to do all this time than break
in upon him as Elijah reproached the god Baalthis domestic god was
either talking or pursuing or was in a journey or peradventure he
slept and could not be awoke

Perhaps He was gone out in company with Honour to fight a duel to
pay off some debt at playor dirty annuity the bargain of his lust
Perhaps Conscience all this time was engaged at home talking aloud
against petty larceny and executing vengeance upon some such puny
crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured him against all
temptation of committing so that he lives as merrilyIf he was of
our church tho quoth Dr Slop he could notsleeps as soundly in
his bedand at last meets death unconcernedlyperhaps much more so
than a much better man

All this is impossible with us quoth Dr Slop turning to my
fatherthe case could not happen in our churchIt happens in ours
however replied my father but too oftenI own quoth Dr Slop
struck a little with my fathers frank acknowledgmentthat a man
in the Romish church may live as badlybut then he cannot easily
die soTis little matter replied my father with an air of
indifferencehow a rascal diesI mean answered Dr Slop he would
be denied the benefits of the last sacramentsPray how many have you
in all said my uncle Tobyfor I always forgetSeven answered
Dr SlopHumphsaid my uncle Toby tho not accented as a note of
acquiescencebut as an interjection of that particular species of
surprize when a man in looking into a drawer finds more of a thing
than he expectedHumph replied my uncle Toby Dr Slop who had an
ear understood my uncle Toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume
against the seven sacramentsHumph replied Dr Slop stating my
uncle Tobys argument over again to himWhy Sir are there not seven
cardinal virtuesSeven mortal sinsSeven golden candlesticksSeven
heavensTis more than I know replied my uncle TobyAre there
not seven wonders of the worldSeven days of the creationSeven
planetsSeven plaguesThat there are quoth my father with a most
affected gravity But prithee continued he go on with the rest of thy
characters Trim

Another is sordid unmerciful here Trim waved his right hand a
straithearted selfish wretch incapable either of private friendship
or public spirit Take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in
their distress and sees all the miseries incident to human life without
a sigh or a prayer An please your honours cried Trim I think this
a viler man than the other

Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasionsNo
thank God there is no occasion I pay every man his ownI have no
fornication to answer to my conscienceno faithless vows or promises
to make upI have debauched no mans wife or child thank God I am
not as other men adulterers unjust or even as this libertine who
stands before me

A third is crafty and designing in his nature View his whole
lifetis nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and
unequitable subterfuges basely to defeat the true intent of
all lawsplain dealing and the safe enjoyment of our several
propertiesYou will see such a one working out a frame of little
designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and needy
manshall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth or the
unsuspecting temper of his friend who would have trusted him with his
life

When old age comes on and repentance calls him to look back upon this
black account and state it over again with his conscienceConscience
looks into the Statutes at Largefinds no express law broken by what
he has doneperceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels
incurredsees no scourge waving over his head or prison opening his
gates upon himWhat is there to affright his conscienceConscience
has got safely entrenched behind the Letter of the Law sits there
invulnerable fortified with Cases and Reports so strongly on all
sidesthat it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold

Here Corporal Trim and my uncle Toby exchanged looks with each
otherAye Aye Trim quoth my uncle Toby shaking his headthese
are but sorry fortifications TrimO very poor work answered Trim
to what your Honour and I make of itThe character of this last man
said Dr Slop interrupting Trim is more detestable than all the rest
and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging Lawyer amongst
youAmongst us a mans conscience could not possibly continue so long
blindedthree times in a year at least he must go to confession
Will that restore it to sight quoth my uncle TobyGo on Trim quoth
my father or Obadiah will have got back before thou has got to the
end of thy sermonTis a very short one replied TrimI wish it was
longer quoth my uncle Toby for I like it hugelyTrim went on

A fourth man shall want even this refugeshall break through all
their ceremony of slow chicanescorns the doubtful workings of
secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purposeSee
the barefaced villain how he cheats lies perjures robs
murdersHorridBut indeed much better was not to be expected in
the present casethe poor man was in the darkhis priest had got the
keeping of his conscienceand all he would let him know of it was
That he must believe in the Popego to Masscross himselftell his
beadsbe a good Catholic and that this in all conscience was enough
to carry him to heaven Whatif he perjuresWhyhe had a mental
reservation in itBut if he is so wicked and abandoned a wretch as you
represent himif he robsif he stabs will not conscience on every
such act receive a wound itselfAyebut the man has carried it to
confessionthe wound digests there and will do well enough and in a
short time be quite healed up by absolution O Popery what hast thou to
answer forwhen not content with the too many natural and fatal ways
thro which the heart of man is every day thus treacherous to itself
above all thingsthou hast wilfully set open the wide gate of deceit
before the face of this unwary traveller too apt God knows to go
astray of himself and confidently speak peace to himself when there is
no peace

Of this the common instances which I have drawn out of life are too
notorious to require much evidence If any man doubts the reality
of them or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to
himselfI must refer him a moment to his own reflections and will
then venture to trust my appeal with his own heart

Let him consider in how different a degree of detestation numbers of
wicked actions stand there tho equally bad and vicious in their own
natureshe will soon find that such of them as strong inclination
and custom have prompted him to commit are generally dressed out and
painted with all the false beauties which a soft and a flattering hand
can give themand that the others to which he feels no propensity
appear at once naked and deformed surrounded with all the true
circumstances of folly and dishonour

When David surprized Saul sleeping in the cave and cut off the skirt
of his robewe read his heart smote him for what he had doneBut in
the matter of Uriah where a faithful and gallant servant whom he
ought to have loved and honoured fell to make way for his lustwhere
conscience had so much greater reason to take the alarm his heart smote
him not A whole year had almost passed from first commission of that
crime to the time Nathan was sent to reprove him and we read not once
of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified during
all that time for what he had done

Thus conscience this once able monitorplaced on high as a judge
within us and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one
tooby an unhappy train of causes and impediments takes often
such imperfect cognizance of what passesdoes its office so
negligentlysometimes so corruptlythat it is not to be trusted
alone and therefore we find there is a necessity an absolute
necessity of joining another principle with it to aid if not govern
its determinations

So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite
importance to you not to be misled innamely in what degree of real
merit you stand either as an honest man an useful citizen a faithful
subject to your king or a good servant to your Godcall in religion
and moralityLook What is written in the law of GodHow readest
thouConsult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice
and truthwhat say they

Let Conscience determine the matter upon these reportsand then
if thy heart condemns thee not which is the case the apostle
supposesthe rule will be infallibleHere Dr Slop fell
asleepthou wilt have confidence towards Godthat is have just
grounds to believe the judgment thou hast past upon thyself is the
judgment of God and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous
sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that Being to
whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions

Blessed is the man indeed then as the author of the book of
Ecclesiasticus expresses it who is not pricked with the multitude of
his sins Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemned him whether
he be rich or whether he be poor if he have a good heart a heart
thus guided and informed he shall at all times rejoice in a chearful
countenance his mind shall tell him more than seven watchmen that sit
above upon a tower on highA tower has no strength quoth my uncle
Toby unless tis flankdin the darkest doubts it shall conduct him
safer than a thousand casuists and give the state he lives in a better
security for his behaviour than all the causes and restrictions put
together which lawmakers are forced to multiplyForced I say as
things stand human laws not being a matter of original choice but of
pure necessity brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of
those consciences which are no law unto themselves well intending by
the many provisions madethat in all such corrupt and misguided
cases where principles and the checks of conscience will not make
us uprightto supply their force and by the terrors of gaols and
halters oblige us to it

I see plainly said my father that this sermon has been composed to be
preached at the Templeor at some AssizeI like the reasoningand
am sorry that Dr Slop has fallen asleep before the time of his
convictionfor it is now clear that the Parson as I thought at
first never insulted St Paul in the leastnor has there been
brother the least difference between themA great matter if they
had differed replied my uncle Tobythe best friends in the world may
differ sometimesTruebrother Toby quoth my father shaking hands
with himwell fill our pipes brother and then Trim shall go on

Wellwhat dost thou think of it said my father speaking to Corporal
Trim as he reached his tobaccobox

I think answered the Corporal that the seven watchmen upon the tower
who I suppose are all centinels thereare more an please your
Honour than were necessaryand to go on at that rate would harrass
a regiment all to pieces which a commanding officer who loves his
men will never do if he can help it because two centinels added
the Corporal are as good as twentyI have been a commanding officer
myself in the Corps de Garde a hundred times continued Trim rising
an inch higher in his figure as he spokeand all the time I had
the honour to serve his Majesty King William in relieving the most
considerable posts I never left more than two in my lifeVery right
Trim quoth my uncle Tobybut you do not consider Trim that the
towers in Solomons days were not such things as our bastions
flanked and defended by other worksthis Trim was an invention since
Solomons death nor had they hornworks or ravelins before the curtin
in his timeor such a fosse as we make with a cuvette in the middle
of it and with covered ways and counterscarps pallisadoed along it to
guard against a Coup de mainSo that the seven men upon the tower were
a party I dare say from the Corps de Garde set there not only to
look out but to defend itThey could be no more an please your
Honour than a Corporals GuardMy father smiled inwardly but not
outwardlythe subject being rather too serious considering what had
happened to make a jest ofSo putting his pipe into his mouth which
he had just lightedhe contented himself with ordering Trim to read
on He read on as follows

To have the fear of God before our eyes and in our mutual dealings
with each other to govern our actions by the eternal measures of
right and wrongThe first of these will comprehend the duties of
religionthe second those of morality which are so inseparably
connected together that you cannot divide these two tables even
in imagination tho the attempt is often made in practice without
breaking and mutually destroying them both

I said the attempt is often made and so it isthere being nothing
more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion and
indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none who would take it as
the bitterest affront should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral
characteror imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to
the uttermost mite

When there is some appearance that it is sotho one is unwilling
even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty
yet were we to look into the grounds of it in the present case I am
persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of
his motive

Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject it will
be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest his
pride his ease or some such little and changeable passion as will give
us but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great distress

I will illustrate this by an example

I know the banker I deal with or the physician I usually call
inThere is no need cried Dr Slop waking to call in any
physician in this caseto be neither of them men of much religion I
hear them make a jest of it every day and treat all its sanctions with
so much scorn as to put the matter past doubt Wellnotwithstanding
this I put my fortune into the hands of the oneand what is dearer
still to me I trust my life to the honest skill of the other

Now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence Why in
the first place I believe there is no probability that either of them
will employ the power I put into their hands to my disadvantageI
consider that honesty serves the purposes of this lifeI know their
success in the world depends upon the fairness of their charactersIn
a word Im persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting
themselves more

But put it otherwise namely that interest lay for once on the other
side that a case should happen wherein the one without stain to
his reputation could secrete my fortune and leave me naked in the
worldor that the other could send me out of it and enjoy an estate
by my death without dishonour to himself or his artIn this case
what hold have I of either of themReligion the strongest of all
motives is out of the questionInterest the next most powerful
motive in the world is strongly against meWhat have I left to
cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptationAlas I have
nothingnothing but what is lighter than a bubbleI must lie at the
mercy of Honour or some such capricious principleStrait security for
two of the most valuable blessingsmy property and myself

As therefore we can have no dependence upon morality without
religionso on the other hand there is nothing better to be expected
from religion without morality nevertheless tis no prodigy to see a
man whose real moral character stands very low who yet entertains the
highest notion of himself in the light of a religious man

He shall not only be covetous revengeful implacablebut even
wanting in points of common honesty yet inasmuch as he talks aloud
against the infidelity of the ageis zealous for some points of
religiongoes twice a day to churchattends the sacramentsand
amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religionshall cheat
his conscience into a judgment that for this he is a religious man
and has discharged truly his duty to God And you will find that such a
man through force of this delusion generally looks down with spiritual
pride upon every other man who has less affectation of pietythough
perhaps ten times more real honesty than himself

This likewise is a sore evil under the sun and I believe there is no
one mistaken principle which for its time has wrought more serious
mischiefsFor a general proof of thisexamine the history of the
Romish churchWell what can you make of that cried Dr Slopsee
what scenes of cruelty murder rapine bloodshedThey may thank
their own obstinacy cried Dr Slophave all been sanctified by a
religion not strictly governed by morality

In how many kingdoms of the worldHere Trim kept waving his
righthand from the sermon to the extent of his arm returning it
backwards and forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph

In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this
misguided sainterrant spared neither age or merit or sex or
conditionand as he fought under the banners of a religion which
set him loose from justice and humanity he shewed none mercilessly
trampled upon bothheard neither the cries of the unfortunate nor
pitied their distresses

I have been in many a battle an please your Honour quoth Trim
sighing but never in so melancholy a one as thisI would not have
drawn a tricker in it against these poor soulsto have been made a
general officerWhy what do you understand of the affair said Dr
Slop looking towards Trim with something more of contempt than the
Corporals honest heart deservedWhat do you know friend about this
battle you talk ofI know replied Trim that I never refused quarter
in my life to any man who cried out for itbut to a woman or a child
continued Trim before I would level my musket at them I would loose
my life a thousand timesHeres a crown for thee Trim to drink with
Obadiah tonight quoth my uncle Toby and Ill give Obadiah another
tooGod bless your Honour replied TrimI had rather these poor
women and children had itthou art an honest fellow quoth my uncle
TobyMy father nodded his head as much as to sayand so he is

But prithee Trim said my father make an endfor I see thou hast but
a leaf or two left

Corporal Trim read on

If the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not
sufficientconsider at this instant how the votaries of that religion
are every day thinking to do service and honour to God by actions which
are a dishonour and scandal to themselves

To be convinced of this go with me for a moment into the prisons of
the InquisitionGod help my poor brother TomBehold Religion
with Mercy and Justice chained down under her feetthere sitting
ghastly upon a black tribunal propped up with racks and instruments of
torment Harkhark what a piteous groanHere Trims face turned
as pale as ashesSee the melancholy wretch who uttered itHere
the tears began to trickle downjust brought forth to undergo the
anguish of a mock trial and endure the utmost pains that a studied
system of cruelty has been able to inventDn them all quoth
Trim his colour returning into his face as red as bloodBehold this
helpless victim delivered up to his tormentorshis body so wasted with
sorrow and confinementOh tis my brother cried poor Trim in a
most passionate exclamation dropping the sermon upon the ground and
clapping his hands togetherI fear tis poor Tom My fathers and my
uncle Tobys heart yearned with sympathy for the poor fellows distress
even Slop himself acknowledged pity for himWhy Trim said my father
this is not a historytis a sermon thou art reading prithee begin
the sentence againBehold this helpless victim delivered up to his
tormentorshis body so wasted with sorrow and confinement you will
see every nerve and muscle as it suffers

Observe the last movement of that horrid engineI would rather face
a cannon quoth Trim stampingSee what convulsions it has thrown
him intoConsider the nature of the posture in which he how lies
stretchedwhat exquisite tortures he endures by itI hope tis not
in PortugalTis all nature can bear Good God see how it keeps his
weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips I would not read another
line of it quoth Trim for all this worldI fear an please your
Honours all this is in Portugal where my poor brother Tom is I
tell thee Trim again quoth my father tis not an historical
accounttis a descriptionTis only a description honest man
quoth Slop theres not a word of truth in itThats another
story replied my fatherHowever as Trim reads it with so much
concerntis cruelty to force him to go on with itGive me hold of
the sermon TrimIll finish it for thee and thou mayst go I must
stay and hear it too replied Trim if your Honour will allow metho
I would not read it myself for a Colonels payPoor Trim quoth my
uncle Toby My father went on

Consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies
stretchedwhat exquisite torture he endures by itTis all nature
can bear Good God See how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon
his trembling lipswilling to take its leavebut not suffered to
departBehold the unhappy wretch led back to his cellThen thank
God however quoth Trim they have not killed himSee him dragged
out of it again to meet the flames and the insults in his last agonies
which this principlethis principle that there can be religion
without mercy has prepared for himThen thank Godhe is dead
quoth Trimhe is out of his painand they have done their worst at
himO SirsHold your peace Trim said my father going on with the
sermon lest Trim should incense Dr Slopwe shall never have done at
this rate

The surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is to trace
down the consequences such a notion has produced and compare them with
the spirit of Christianitytis the short and decisive rule which our
Saviour hath left us for these and such like cases and it is worth a
thousand argumentsBy their fruits ye shall know them

I will add no farther to the length of this sermon than by two or
three short and independent rules deducible from it

First Whenever a man talks loudly against religion always suspect
that it is not his reason but his passions which have got the
better of his Creed A bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and
troublesome neighbours and where they separate depend upon it tis
for no other cause but quietness sake

Secondly When a man thus represented tells you in any particular
instanceThat such a thing goes against his consciencealways
believe he means exactly the same thing as when he tells you such
a thing goes against his stomacha present want of appetite being
generally the true cause of both

In a wordtrust that man in nothing who has not a Conscience in
every thing

And in your own case remember this plain distinction a mistake in
which has ruined thousandsthat your conscience is not a lawNo
God and reason made the law and have placed conscience within you to
determinenot like an Asiatic Cadi according to the ebbs and flows
of his own passionsbut like a British judge in this land of liberty
and good sense who makes no new law but faithfully declares that law
which he knows already written

Finis

Thou hast read the sermon extremely well Trim quoth my fatherIf he
had spared his comments replied Dr Slophe would have read it much
better I should have read it ten times better Sir answered Trim but
that my heart was so fullThat was the very reason Trim replied my
father which has made thee read the sermon as well as thou hast done
and if the clergy of our church continued my father addressing himself
to Dr Slop would take part in what they deliver as deeply as this poor
fellow has doneas their compositions are fineI deny it quoth
Dr SlopI maintain itthat the eloquence of our pulpits with such
subjects to enflame it would be a model for the whole worldBut alas
continued my father and I own it Sir with sorrow that like French
politicians in this respect what they gain in the cabinet they lose in
the fieldTwere a pity quoth my uncle that this should be lost I
like the sermon well replied my fathertis dramatickand there is
something in that way of writing when skilfully managed which catches
the attentionWe preach much in that way with us said Dr SlopI
know that very well said my fatherbut in a tone and manner which
disgusted Dr Slop full as much as his assent simply could have
pleased himBut in this added Dr Slop a little piquedour sermons
have greatly the advantage that we never introduce any character
into them below a patriarch or a patriarchs wife or a martyr or a
saintThere are some very bad characters in this however said my
father and I do not think the sermon a jot the worse for emBut
pray quoth my uncle Tobywhos can this beHow could it get into my
Stevinus A man must be as great a conjurer as Stevinus said my
father to resolve the second questionThe first I think is not
so difficultfor unless my judgment greatly deceives meI know the
author for tis wrote certainly by the parson of the parish

The similitude of the stile and manner of it with those my father
constantly had heard preached in his parishchurch was the ground of
his conjectureproving it as strongly as an argument a priori could
prove such a thing to a philosophic mind That it was Yoricks and no
ones elseIt was proved to be so a posteriori the day after when
Yorick sent a servant to my uncle Tobys house to enquire after it

It seems that Yorick who was inquisitive after all kinds of knowledge
had borrowed Stevinus of my uncle Toby and had carelesly popped his
sermon as soon as he had made it into the middle of Stevinus and
by an act of forgetfulness to which he was ever subject he had sent
Stevinus home and his sermon to keep him company

Illfated sermon Thou wast lost after this recovery of thee a second
time dropped thru an unsuspected fissure in thy masters pocket down
into a treacherous and a tattered liningtrod deep into the dirt by
the left hindfoot of his Rosinante inhumanly stepping upon thee as
thou falledstburied ten days in the mireraised up out of it by
a beggarsold for a halfpenny to a parishclerktransferred to
his parsonlost for ever to thy own the remainder of his daysnor
restored to his restless Manes till this very moment that I tell the
world the story

Can the reader believe that this sermon of Yoricks was preached at an
assize in the cathedral of York before a thousand witnesses ready to
give oath of it by a certain prebendary of that church and actually
printed by him when he had doneand within so short a space as two
years and three months after Yoricks deathYorick indeed was never
better served in his lifebut it was a little hard to maltreat him
after and plunder him after he was laid in his grave

However as the gentleman who did it was in perfect charity with
Yorickand in conscious justice printed but a few copies to give
awayand that I am told he could moreover have made as good a one
himself had he thought fitI declare I would not have published this
anecdote to the worldnor do I publish it with an intent to hurt his
character and advancement in the churchI leave that to othersbut I
find myself impelled by two reasons which I cannot withstand

The first is That in doing justice I may give rest to Yoricks
ghostwhichas the countrypeople and some others believestill
walks

The second reason is That by laying open this story to the world
I gain an opportunity of informing itThat in case the character of
parson Yorick and this sample of his sermons is likedthere are now
in the possession of the Shandy family as many as will make a handsome
volume at the worlds serviceand much good may they do it



Chapter 1XLIII

Obadiah gained the two crowns without disputefor he came in jingling
with all the instruments in the green baize bag we spoke of flung
across his body just as Corporal Trim went out of the room

It is now proper I think quoth Dr Slop clearing up his looks as
we are in a condition to be of some service to Mrs Shandy to send up
stairs to know how she goes on

I have ordered answered my father the old midwife to come down to us
upon the least difficultyfor you must know Dr Slop continued my
father with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance that by
express treaty solemnly ratified between me and my wife you are no
more than an auxiliary in this affairand not so much as thatunless
the lean old mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without
youWomen have their particular fancies and in points of this nature
continued my father where they bear the whole burden and suffer so
much acute pain for the advantage of our families and the good of
the speciesthey claim a right of deciding en Souveraines in whose
hands and in what fashion they choose to undergo it

They are in the right of itquoth my uncle Toby But Sir replied Dr
Slop not taking notice of my uncle Tobys opinion but turning to my
fatherthey had better govern in other pointsand a father of a
family who wishes its perpetuity in my opinion had better exchange
this prerogative with them and give up some other rights in lieu of
itI know not quoth my father answering a letter too testily to be
quite dispassionate in what he saidI know not quoth he what we have
left to give up in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world
unless thatof who shall beget themOne would almost give up
any thing replied Dr SlopI beg your pardonanswered my uncle
TobySir replied Dr Slop it would astonish you to know what
improvements we have made of late years in all branches of obstetrical
knowledge but particularly in that one single point of the safe and
expeditious extraction of the foetuswhich has received such lights
that for my part holding up his hand I declare I wonder how the world
hasI wish quoth my uncle Toby you had seen what prodigious armies we
had in Flanders



Chapter 1XLIV

I have dropped the curtain over this scene for a minuteto remind you
of one thingand to inform you of another

What I have to inform you comes I own a little out of its due
coursefor it should have been told a hundred and fifty pages ago
but that I foresaw then twould come in pat hereafter and be of more
advantage here than elsewhereWriters had need look before them to
keep up the spirit and connection of what they have in hand

When these two things are donethe curtain shall be drawn up again
and my uncle Toby my father and Dr Slop shall go on with their
discourse without any more interruption

First then the matter which I have to remind you of is thisthat
from the specimens of singularity in my fathers notions in the point of
Christiannames and that other previous point theretoyou was led I
think into an opinionand I am sure I said as much that my father
was a gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions
In truth there was not a stage in the life of man from the very first
act of his begettingdown to the lean and slippered pantaloon in
his second childishness but he had some favourite notion to himself
springing out of it as sceptical and as far out of the highway of
thinking as these two which have been explained

Mr Shandy my father Sir would see nothing in the light in which
others placed ithe placed things in his own lighthe would weigh
nothing in common scalesno he was too refined a researcher to lie
open to so gross an impositionTo come at the exact weight of things
in the scientific steelyard the fulcrum he would say should be
almost invisible to avoid all friction from popular tenetswithout
this the minutiae of philosophy which would always turn the balance
will have no weight at all Knowledge like matter he would affirm
was divisible in infinitumthat the grains and scruples were as much a
part of it as the gravitation of the whole worldIn a word he
would say error was errorno matter where it fellwhether in a
fractionor a poundtwas alike fatal to truth and she was kept
down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mistake in the dust
of a butterflys wingas in the disk of the sun the moon and all the
stars of heaven put together

He would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly
and of applying it skilfully to civil matters as well as to speculative
truths that so many things in this world were out of jointthat the
political arch was giving wayand that the very foundations of our
excellent constitution in church and state were so sapped as estimators
had reported

You cry out he would say we are a ruined undone people Why he would
ask making use of the sorites or syllogism of Zeno and Chrysippus
without knowing it belonged to themWhy why are we a ruined
peopleBecause we are corruptedWhence is it dear Sir that we
are corruptedBecause we are needyour poverty and not our wills
consentAnd wherefore he would add are we needyFrom the neglect
he would answer of our pence and our halfpenceOur bank notes Sir
our guineasnay our shillings take care of themselves

Tis the same he would say throughout the whole circle of the
sciencesthe great the established points of them are not to
be broke in uponThe laws of nature will defend themselvesbut
errorhe would add looking earnestly at my mothererror Sir
creeps in thro the minute holes and small crevices which human nature
leaves unguarded

This turn of thinking in my father is what I had to remind you ofThe
point you are to be informed of and which I have reserved for this
place is as follows

Amongst the many and excellent reasons with which my father had urged
my mother to accept of Dr Slops assistance preferably to that of the
old womanthere was one of a very singular nature which when he had
done arguing the matter with her as a Christian and came to argue it
over again with her as a philosopher he had put his whole strength to
depending indeed upon it as his sheetanchorIt failed him tho from
no defect in the argument itself but that do what he could he was
not able for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of itCursed
lucksaid he to himself one afternoon as he walked out of the room
after he had been stating it for an hour and a half to her to no
manner of purposecursed luck said he biting his lip as he shut the
doorfor a man to be master of one of the finest chains of reasoning
in natureand have a wife at the same time with such a headpiece
that he cannot hang up a single inference within side of it to save his
soul from destruction

This argument though it was entirely lost upon my motherhad more
weight with him than all his other arguments joined togetherI will
therefore endeavour to do it justiceand set it forth with all the
perspicuity I am master of

My father set out upon the strength of these two following axioms

First That an ounce of a mans own wit was worth a ton of other
peoples and

Secondly Which by the bye was the groundwork of the first
axiomtho it comes last That every mans wit must come from every
mans own souland no other bodys

Now as it was plain to my father that all souls were by nature
equaland that the great difference between the most acute and the
most obtuse understandingwas from no original sharpness or bluntness
of one thinking substance above or below anotherbut arose merely from
the lucky or unlucky organization of the body in that part where the
soul principally took up her residencehe had made it the subject of
his enquiry to find out the identical place

Now from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter he
was satisfied it could not be where Des Cartes had fixed it upon the
top of the pineal gland of the brain which as he philosophized formed
a cushion for her about the size of a marrow pea tho to speak the
truth as so many nerves did terminate all in that one placetwas
no bad conjectureand my father had certainly fallen with that great
philosopher plumb into the centre of the mistake had it not been for
my uncle Toby who rescued him out of it by a story he told him of a
Walloon officer at the battle of Landen who had one part of his brain
shot away by a musketballand another part of it taken out after by
a French surgeon and after all recovered and did his duty very well
without it

If death said my father reasoning with himself is nothing but the
separation of the soul from the bodyand if it is true that people can
walk about and do their business without brainsthen certes the soul
does not inhabit there QED

As for that certain very thin subtle and very fragrant juice which
Coglionissimo Borri the great Milaneze physician affirms in a letter
to Bartholine to have discovered in the cellulae of the occipital parts
of the cerebellum and which he likewise affirms to be the principal
seat of the reasonable soul for you must know in these latter and
more enlightened ages there are two souls in every man livingthe
one according to the great Metheglingius being called the Animus the
other the Animaas for the opinion I say of Borrimy father
could never subscribe to it by any means the very idea of so noble so
refined so immaterial and so exalted a being as the Anima or even the
Animus taking up her residence and sitting dabbling like a tadpole
all day long both summer and winter in a puddleor in a liquid
of any kind how thick or thin soever he would say shocked his
imagination he would scarce give the doctrine a hearing

What therefore seemed the least liable to objections of any was that
the chief sensorium or headquarters of the soul and to which place
all intelligences were referred and from whence all her mandates were
issuedwas in or near the cerebellumor rather somewhere about the
medulla oblongata wherein it was generally agreed by Dutch anatomists
that all the minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses
concentered like streets and winding alleys into a square

So far there was nothing singular in my fathers opinionhe had
the best of philosophers of all ages and climates to go along with
himBut here he took a road of his own setting up another Shandean
hypothesis upon these cornerstones they had laid for himand which
said hypothesis equally stood its ground whether the subtilty and
fineness of the soul depended upon the temperature and clearness of
the said liquor or of the finer network and texture in the cerebellum
itself which opinion he favoured

He maintained that next to the due care to be taken in the act of
propagation of each individual which required all the thought in the
world as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible contexture
in which wit memory fancy eloquence and what is usually meant by
the name of good natural parts do consistthat next to this and his
Christianname which were the two original and most efficacious causes
of allthat the third cause or rather what logicians call the Causa
sina qua non and without which all that was done was of no manner of
significancewas the preservation of this delicate and finespun
web from the havock which was generally made in it by the violent
compression and crush which the head was made to undergo by the
nonsensical method of bringing us into the world by that foremost

This requires explanation

My father who dipped into all kinds of books upon looking into
Lithopaedus Senonesis de Portu difficili The author is here twice
mistaken for Lithopaedus should be wrote thus Lithopaedii Senonensis
Icon The second mistake is that this Lithopaedus is not an author
but a drawing of a petrified child The account of this published by
Athosius 1580 may be seen at the end of Cordaeuss works in Spachius
Mr Tristram Shandy has been led into this error either from seeing
Lithopaeduss name of late in a catalogue of learned writers in Dr
or by mistaking Lithopaedus for Trinecavelliusfrom the too great
similitude of the names published by Adrianus Smelvgot had found out
that the lax and pliable state of a childs head in parturition the
bones of the cranium having no sutures at that time was suchthat by
force of the womans efforts which in strong labourpains was
equal upon an average to the weight of 470 pounds avoirdupois acting
perpendicularly upon itit so happened that in 49 instances out of
50 the said head was compressed and moulded into the shape of an oblong
conical piece of dough such as a pastrycook generally rolls up in
order to make a pye ofGood God cried my father what havock and
destruction must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of
the cerebellumOr if there is such a juice as Borri pretendsis it
not enough to make the clearest liquid in the world both seculent and
mothery

But how great was his apprehension when he farther understood that
this force acting upon the very vertex of the head not only injured
the brain itself or cerebrumbut that it necessarily squeezed and
propelled the cerebrum towards the cerebellum which was the immediate
seat of the understandingAngels and ministers of grace defend us
cried my fathercan any soul withstand this shockNo wonder the
intellectual web is so rent and tattered as we see it and that so
many of our best heads are no better than a puzzled skein of silkall
perplexityall confusion withinside

But when my father read on and was let into the secret that when a
child was turned topsyturvy which was easy for an operator to do and
was extracted by the feetthat instead of the cerebrum being propelled
towards the cerebellum the cerebellum on the contrary was propelled
simply towards the cerebrum where it could do no manner of hurtBy
heavens cried he the world is in conspiracy to drive out what little
wit God has given usand the professors of the obstetric art are
listed into the same conspiracyWhat is it to me which end of my son
comes foremost into the world provided all goes right after and his
cerebellum escapes uncrushed

It is the nature of an hypothesis when once a man has conceived it
that it assimilates every thing to itself as proper nourishment and
from the first moment of your begetting it it generally grows the
stronger by every thing you see hear read or understand This is of
great use

When my father was gone with this about a month there was scarce a
phaenomenon of stupidity or of genius which he could not readily solve
by itit accounted for the eldest son being the greatest blockhead in
the familyPoor devil he would sayhe made way for the capacity of
his younger brothersIt unriddled the observations of drivellers and
monstrous headsshewing a priori it could not be otherwiseunless
I dont know what It wonderfully explained and accounted for the
acumen of the Asiatic genius and that sprightlier turn and a more
penetrating intuition of minds in warmer climates not from the
loose and commonplace solution of a clearer sky and a more perpetual
sunshine cwhich for aught he knew might as well rarefy and dilute
the faculties of the soul into nothing by one extremeas they are
condensed in colder climates by the otherbut he traced the affair up
to its springheadshewed that in warmer climates nature had laid
a lighter tax upon the fairest parts of the creationtheir pleasures
morethe necessity of their pains less insomuch that the pressure and
resistance upon the vertex was so slight that the whole organization
of the cerebellum was preservednay he did not believe in natural
births that so much as a single thread of the network was broke or
displacedso that the soul might just act as she liked

When my father had got so farwhat a blaze of light did the accounts
of the Caesarian section and of the towering geniuses who had come safe
into the world by it cast upon this hypothesis Here you see he would
say there was no injury done to the sensoriumno pressure of the
head against the pelvisno propulsion of the cerebrum towards the
cerebellum either by the os pubis on this side or os coxygis on
thatand pray what were the happy consequences Why Sir your Julius
Caesar who gave the operation a nameand your Hermes Trismegistus
who was born so before ever the operation had a nameyour Scipio
Africanus your Manlius Torquatus our Edward the Sixthwho had he
lived would have done the same honour to the hypothesisThese and
many more who figured high in the annals of fameall came sideway
Sir into the world

The incision of the abdomen and uterus ran for six weeks together in
my fathers headhe had read and was satisfied that wounds in the
epigastrium and those in the matrix were not mortalso that the
belly of the mother might be opened extremely well to give a passage to
the childHe mentioned the thing one afternoon to my mothermerely
as a matter of fact but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very
mention of it as much as the operation flattered his hopeshe
thought it as well to say no more of itcontenting himself with
admiringwhat he thought was to no purpose to propose

This was my father Mr Shandys hypothesis concerning which I have only
to add that my brother Bobby did as great honour to it whatever he did
to the family as any one of the great heroes we spoke of For happening
not only to be christened as I told you but to be born too when my
father was at Epsombeing moreover my mothers first childcoming
into the world with his head foremostand turning out afterwards a lad
of wonderful slow partsmy father spelt all these together into his
opinion and as he had failed at one endhe was determined to try the
other

This was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood who are not
easily to be put out of their wayand was therefore one of my fathers
great reasons in favour of a man of science whom he could better deal
with

Of all men in the world Dr Slop was the fittest for my fathers
purposefor though this newinvented forceps was the armour he
had proved and what he maintained to be the safest instrument of
deliverance yet it seems he had scattered a word or two in his book
in favour of the very thing which ran in my fathers fancytho not
with a view to the souls good in extracting by the feet as was my
fathers systembut for reasons merely obstetrical

This will account for the coalition betwixt my father and Dr Slop
in the ensuing discourse which went a little hard against my uncle
TobyIn what manner a plain man with nothing but common sense could
bear up against two such allies in scienceis hard to conceiveYou
may conjecture upon it if you pleaseand whilst your imagination is
in motion you may encourage it to go on and discover by what causes
and effects in nature it could come to pass that my uncle Toby got his
modesty by the wound he received upon his groinYou may raise a system
to account for the loss of my nose by marriagearticlesand shew
the world how it could happen that I should have the misfortune to be
called Tristram in opposition to my fathers hypothesis and the wish
of the whole family Godfathers and Godmothers not exceptedThese
with fifty other points left yet unravelled you may endeavour to solve
if you have timebut I tell you beforehand it will be in vain for
not the sage Alquise the magician in Don Belianis of Greece nor the
no less famous Urganda the sorceress his wife were they alive could
pretend to come within a league of the truth

The reader will be content to wait for a full explanation of these
matters till the next yearwhen a series of things will be laid open
which he little expects



Chapter 1XLV

I wish Dr Slop quoth my uncle Toby repeating his wish for Dr
Slop a second time and with a degree of more zeal and earnestness in
his manner of wishing than he had wished at first VideI wish
Dr Slop quoth my uncle Toby you had seen what prodigious armies we
had in Flanders

My uncle Tobys wish did Dr Slop a disservice which his heart never
intended any manSir it confounded himand thereby putting his ideas
first into confusion and then to flight he could not rally them again
for the soul of him

In all disputesmale or femalewhether for honour for profit
or for loveit makes no difference in the casenothing is more
dangerous Madam than a wish coming sideways in this unexpected manner
upon a man the safest way in general to take off the force of the wish
is for the party wishd at instantly to get upon his legsand wish the
wisher something in return of pretty near the same valueso balancing
the account upon the spot you stand as you werenay sometimes gain the
advantage of the attack by it

This will be fully illustrated to the world in my chapter of wishes

Dr Slop did not understand the nature of this defencehe was puzzled
with it and it put an entire stop to the dispute for four minutes and a
halffive had been fatal to itmy father saw the dangerthe dispute
was one of the most interesting disputes in the world Whether the
child of his prayers and endeavours should be born without a head or
with onehe waited to the last moment to allow Dr Slop in whose
behalf the wish was made his right of returning it but perceiving I
say that he was confounded and continued looking with that perplexed
vacuity of eye which puzzled souls generally stare withfirst in my
uncle Tobys facethen in histhen upthen downthen easteast and
by east and so oncoasting it along by the plinth of the wainscot
till he had got to the opposite point of the compassand that he had
actually begun to count the brass nails upon the arm of his chairmy
father thought there was no time to be lost with my uncle Toby so took
up the discourse as follows



Chapter 1XLVI

What prodigious armies you had in Flanders

Brother Toby replied my father taking his wig from off his head
with his right hand and with his left pulling out a striped India
handkerchief from his right coat pocket in order to rub his head as he
argued the point with my uncle Toby

Now in this I think my father was much to blame and I will give you
my reasons for it

Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than Whether my
father should have taken off his wig with his right hand or with his
lefthave divided the greatest kingdoms and made the crowns of the
monarchs who governed them to totter upon their headsBut need I tell
you Sir that the circumstances with which every thing in this world
is begirt give every thing in this world its size and shapeand by
tightening it or relaxing it this way or that make the thing to be
what it isgreatlittlegoodbadindifferent or not indifferent
just as the case happens

As my fathers India handkerchief was in his right coat pocket he
should by no means have suffered his right hand to have got engaged on
the contrary instead of taking off his wig with it as he did he ought
to have committed that entirely to the left and then when the natural
exigency my father was under of rubbing his head called out for his
handkerchief he would have had nothing in the world to have done
but to have put his right hand into his right coat pocket and taken
it outwhich he might have done without any violence or the least
ungraceful twist in any one tendon or muscle of his whole body

In this case unless indeed my father had been resolved to make a
fool of himself by holding the wig stiff in his left handor by making
some nonsensical angle or other at his elbowjoint or armpithis
whole attitude had been easynaturalunforced Reynolds himself as
great and gracefully as he paints might have painted him as he sat

Now as my father managed this matterconsider what a devil of a figure
my father made of himself

In the latter end of Queen Annes reign and in the beginning of the
reign of King George the firstCoat pockets were cut very low down
in the skirtI need say no morethe father of mischief had he been
hammering at it a month could not have contrived a worse fashion for
one in my fathers situation



Chapter 1XLVII

It was not an easy matter in any kings reign unless you were as lean
a subject as myself to have forced your hand diagonally quite
across your whole body so as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat
pocketIn the year one thousand seven hundred and eighteen when
this happened it was extremely difficult so that when my uncle Toby
discovered the transverse zigzaggery of my fathers approaches towards
it it instantly brought into his mind those he had done duty in before
the gate of St Nicolasthe idea of which drew off his attention so
intirely from the subject in debate that he had got his right hand
to the bell to ring up Trim to go and fetch his map of Namur and his
compasses and sector along with it to measure the returning angles of
the traverses of that attackbut particularly of that one where he
received his wound upon his groin

My father knit his brows and as he knit them all the blood in his body
seemed to rush up into his facemy uncle Toby dismounted immediately

I did not apprehend your uncle Toby was ohorseback



Chapter 1XLVIII

A mans body and his mind with the utmost reverence to both I speak it
are exactly like a jerkin and a jerkins liningrumple the oneyou
rumple the other There is one certain exception however in this case
and that is when you are so fortunate a fellow as to have had your
jerkin made of gumtaffeta and the bodylining to it of a sarcenet or
thin persian

Zeno Cleanthes Diogenes Babylonius Dionysius Heracleotes Antipater
Panaetius and Possidonius amongst the GreeksCato and Varro and
Seneca amongst the RomansPantenus and Clemens Alexandrinus and
Montaigne amongst the Christians and a score and a half of good
honest unthinking Shandean people as ever lived whose names I cant
recollectall pretended that their jerkins were made after this
fashionyou might have rumpled and crumpled and doubled and creased
and fretted and fridged the outside of them all to piecesin short
you might have played the very devil with them and at the same time
not one of the insides of them would have been one button the worse for
all you had done to them

I believe in my conscience that mine is made up somewhat after this
sortfor never poor jerkin has been tickled off at such a rate as it
has been these last nine months togetherand yet I declare the lining
to itas far as I am a judge of the matteris not a threepenny
piece the worsepellmell helterskelter dingdong cut and thrust
back stroke and fore stroke side way and longway have they
been trimming it for mehad there been the least gumminess in my
liningby heaven it had all of it long ago been frayed and fretted to
a thread

You Messrs the Monthly Reviewershow could you cut and slash my
jerkin as you didhow did you know but you would cut my lining too

Heartily and from my soul to the protection of that Being who will
injure none of us do I recommend you and your affairsso God bless
youonly next month if any one of you should gnash his teeth and
storm and rage at me as some of you did last May in which I remember
the weather was very hotdont be exasperated if I pass it by again
with good temperbeing determined as long as I live or write which in
my case means the same thing never to give the honest gentleman a worse
word or a worse wish than my uncle Toby gave the fly which buzzd about
his nose all dinnertimeGogo poor devil quoth heget thee
gonewhy should I hurt thee This world is surely wide enough to hold
both thee and me



Chapter 1XLIX

Any man Madam reasoning upwards and observing the prodigious
suffusion of blood in my fathers countenanceby means of which as
all the blood in his body seemed to rush into his face as I told you
he must have reddened pictorically and scientifically speaking
six whole tints and a half if not a full octave above his natural
colourany man Madam but my uncle Toby who had observed this
together with the violent knitting of my fathers brows and the
extravagant contortion of his body during the whole affairwould have
concluded my father in a rage and taking that for grantedhad he
been a lover of such kind of concord as arises from two such instruments
being put in exact tunehe would instantly have skrewd up his to
the same pitchand then the devil and all had broke loosethe
whole piece Madam must have been played off like the sixth of Avison
Scarlatticon furialike madGrant me patienceWhat has con
furiacon strepitoor any other hurly burly whatever to do with
harmony

Any man I say Madam but my uncle Toby the benignity of whose heart
interpreted every motion of the body in the kindest sense the motion
would admit of would have concluded my father angry and blamed
him too My uncle Toby blamed nothing but the taylor who cut the
pocketholeso sitting still till my father had got his handkerchief
out of it and looking all the time up in his face with inexpressible
goodwillmy father at length went on as follows



Chapter 1L

What prodigious armies you had in Flanders

Brother Toby quoth my father I do believe thee to be as honest a
man and with as good and as upright a heart as ever God creatednor
is it thy fault if all the children which have been may can shall
will or ought to be begotten come with their heads foremost into
the worldbut believe me dear Toby the accidents which unavoidably
waylay them not only in the article of our begetting emthough
these in my opinion are well worth consideringbut the dangers and
difficulties our children are beset with after they are got forth into
the world are enowlittle need is there to expose them to unnecessary
ones in their passage to itAre these dangers quoth my uncle Toby
laying his hand upon my fathers knee and looking up seriously in his
face for an answerare these dangers greater now odays brother
than in times past Brother Toby answered my father if a child was but
fairly begot and born alive and healthy and the mother did well after
itour forefathers never looked fartherMy uncle Toby instantly
withdrew his hand from off my fathers knee reclined his body gently
back in his chair raised his head till he could just see the cornice of
the room and then directing the buccinatory muscles along his cheeks
and the orbicular muscles around his lips to do their dutyhe whistled
Lillabullero



Chapter 1LI

Whilst my uncle Toby was whistling Lillabullero to my fatherDr Slop
was stamping and cursing and damning at Obadiah at a most dreadful
rateit would have done your heart good and cured you Sir for
ever of the vile sin of swearing to have heard him I am determined
therefore to relate the whole affair to you

When Dr Slops maid delivered the green baize bag with her masters
instruments in it to Obadiah she very sensibly exhorted him to put his
head and one arm through the strings and ride with it slung across his
body so undoing the bowknot to lengthen the strings for him without
any more ado she helped him on with it However as this in some
measure unguarded the mouth of the bag lest any thing should bolt out
in galloping back at the speed Obadiah threatened they consulted to
take it off again and in the great care and caution of their hearts
they had taken the two strings and tied them close pursing up the mouth
of the bag first with half a dozen hard knots each of which Obadiah
to make all safe had twitched and drawn together with all the strength
of his body

This answered all that Obadiah and the maid intended but was no remedy
against some evils which neither he or she foresaw The instruments it
seems as tight as the bag was tied above had so much room to play in
it towards the bottom the shape of the bag being conical that Obadiah
could not make a trot of it but with such a terrible jingle what with
the tire tete forceps and squirt as would have been enough had Hymen
been taking a jaunt that way to have frightened him out of the country
but when Obadiah accelerated his motion and from a plain trot assayed
to prick his coachhorse into a full gallopby Heaven Sir the jingle
was incredible

As Obadiah had a wife and three childrenthe turpitude of fornication
and the many other political ill consequences of this jingling never
once entered his brainhe had however his objection which came home
to himself and weighed with him as it has ofttimes done with the
greatest patriotsThe poor fellow Sir was not able to hear himself
whistle



Chapter 1LII

As Obadiah loved windmusic preferably to all the instrumental music he
carried with himhe very considerately set his imagination to work
to contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a
condition of enjoying it

In all distresses except musical where small cords are wanted nothing
is so apt to enter a mans head as his hatbandthe philosophy of this
is so near the surfaceI scorn to enter into it

As Obadiahs was a mixed casemark SirsI say a mixed case for it
was obstetricalscriptical squirtical papisticaland as far as
the coachhorse was concerned in itcaballisticaland only partly
musicalObadiah made no scruple of availing himself of the first
expedient which offered so taking hold of the bag and instruments and
griping them hard together with one hand and with the finger and thumb
of the other putting the end of the hatband betwixt his teeth and then
slipping his hand down to the middle of ithe tied and crosstied them
all fast together from one end to the other as you would cord a trunk
with such a multiplicity of roundabouts and intricate cross turns with
a hard knot at every intersection or point where the strings metthat
Dr Slop must have had three fifths of Jobs patience at least to have
unloosed themI think in my conscience that had Nature been in one of
her nimble moods and in humour for such a contestand she and Dr Slop
both fairly started togetherthere is no man living which had seen the
bag with all that Obadiah had done to itand known likewise the great
speed the Goddess can make when she thinks proper who would have had
the least doubt remaining in his mindwhich of the two would have
carried off the prize My mother Madam had been delivered sooner than
the green bag infalliblyat least by twenty knotsSport of small
accidents Tristram Shandy that thou art and ever will be had that
trial been for thee and it was fifty to one but it hadthy affairs
had not been so depressdat least by the depression of thy nose as
they have been nor had the fortunes of thy house and the occasions of
making them which have so often presented themselves in the course
of thy life to thee been so often so vexatiously so tamely so
irrecoverably abandonedas thou hast been forced to leave thembut
tis overall but the account of em which cannot be given to the
curious till I am got out into the world

Chapter 2I

Great wits jump for the moment Dr Slop cast his eyes upon his bag
which he had not done till the dispute with my uncle Toby about
midwifery put him in mind of itthe very same thought occurredTis
Gods mercy quoth he to himself that Mrs Shandy has had so bad a
time of itelse she might have been brought to bed seven times told
before one half of these knots could have got untiedBut here you must
distinguishthe thought floated only in Dr Slops mind without sail
or ballast to it as a simple proposition millions of which as your
worship knows are every day swimming quietly in the middle of the
thin juice of a mans understanding without being carried backwards or
forwards till some little gusts of passion or interest drive them to
one side

A sudden trampling in the room above near my mothers bed did
the proposition the very service I am speaking of By all thats
unfortunate quoth Dr Slop unless I make haste the thing will
actually befall me as it is



Chapter 2II

In the case of knotsby which in the first place I would not be
understood to mean slipknotsbecause in the course of my life and
opinionsmy opinions concerning them will come in more properly when I
mention the catastrophe of my great uncle Mr Hammond Shandya
little manbut of high fancyhe rushed into the duke of Monmouths
affairnor secondly in this place do I mean that particular species
of knots called bowknotsthere is so little address or skill or
patience required in the unloosing them that they are below my giving
any opinion at all about themBut by the knots I am speaking of may
it please your reverences to believe that I mean good honest devilish
tight hard knots made bona fide as Obadiah made hisin which there
is no quibbling provision made by the duplication and return of the
two ends of the strings thro the annulus or noose made by the second
implication of themto get them slippd and undone byI hope you
apprehend me

In the case of these knots then and of the several obstructions which
may it please your reverences such knots cast in our way in getting
through lifeevery hasty man can whip out his penknife and cut through
themTis wrong Believe me Sirs the most virtuous way and which
both reason and conscience dictateis to take our teeth or our fingers
to themDr Slop had lost his teethhis favourite instrument by
extracting in a wrong direction or by some misapplication of it
unfortunately slipping he had formerly in a hard labour knockd
out three of the best of them with the handle of ithe tried his
fingersalas the nails of his fingers and thumbs were cut closeThe
duce take it I can make nothing of it either way cried Dr SlopThe
trampling over head near my mothers bedside increasedPox take the
fellow I shall never get the knots untied as long as I liveMy mother
gave a groanLend me your penknifeI must een cut the knots at
lastpughpshaLord I have cut my thumb quite across to the very
bonecurse the fellowif there was not another manmidwife within
fifty milesI am undone for this boutI wish the scoundrel hangdI
wish he was shotI wish all the devils in hell had him for a
blockhead

My father had a great respect for Obadiah and could not bear to hear
him disposed of in such a mannerhe had moreover some little respect
for himselfand could as ill bear with the indignity offered to himself
in it

Had Dr Slop cut any part about him but his thumbmy father had passd
it byhis prudence had triumphed as it was he was determined to have
his revenge

Small curses Dr Slop upon great occasions quoth my father condoling
with him first upon the accident are but so much waste of our strength
and souls health to no manner of purposeI own it replied Dr
SlopThey are like sparrowshot quoth my uncle Toby suspending his
whistling fired against a bastionThey serve continued my father
to stir the humoursbut carry off none of their acrimonyfor my own
part I seldom swear or curse at allI hold it badbut if I fall into
it by surprize I generally retain so much presence of mind right
quoth my uncle Toby as to make it answer my purposethat is I swear
on till I find myself easy A wife and a just man however would always
endeavour to proportion the vent given to these humours not only to the
degree of them stirring within himselfbut to the size and ill intent
of the offence upon which they are to fallInjuries come only from
the heartquoth my uncle Toby For this reason continued my father
with the most Cervantick gravity I have the greatest veneration in the
world for that gentleman who in distrust of his own discretion in
this point sat down and composed that is at his leisure fit forms
of swearing suitable to all cases from the lowest to the highest
provocation which could possibly happen to himwhich forms being well
considered by him and such moreover as he could stand to he kept them
ever by him on the chimneypiece within his reach ready for useI
never apprehended replied Dr Slop that such a thing was ever thought
ofmuch less executed I beg your pardon answered my father I was
reading though not using one of them to my brother Toby this
morning whilst he pourd out the teatis here upon the shelf over
my headbut if I remember right tis too violent for a cut of the
thumbNot at all quoth Dr Slopthe devil take the fellowThen
answered my father Tis much at your service Dr Slopon condition
you will read it aloudso rising up and reaching down a form of
excommunication of the church of Rome a copy of which my father who
was curious in his collections had procured out of the legerbook
of the church of Rochester writ by Ernulphus the bishopwith a
most affected seriousness of look and voice which might have cajoled
Ernulphus himselfhe put it into Dr Slops handsDr Slop wrapt his
thumb up in the corner of his handkerchief and with a wry face though
without any suspicion read aloud as followsmy uncle Toby whistling
Lillabullero as loud as he could all the time

As the geniuneness of the consultation of the Sorbonne upon the
question of baptism was doubted by some and denied by otherstwas
thought proper to print the original of this excommunication for the
copy of which Mr Shandy returns thanks to the chapter clerk of the dean
and chapter of Rochester

Chapter 2IV

By the authority of God Almighty the Father Son and Holy Ghost
and of the holy canons and of the undefiled Virgin Mary mother and
patroness of our Saviour I think there is no necessity quoth Dr
Slop dropping the paper down to his knee and addressing himself to my
fatheras you have read it over Sir so lately to read it aloudand
as Captain Shandy seems to have no great inclination to hear itI
may as well read it to myself Thats contrary to treaty replied my
fatherbesides there is something so whimsical especially in the
latter part of it I should grieve to lose the pleasure of a second
reading Dr Slop did not altogether like itbut my uncle Toby
offering at that instant to give over whistling and read it himself to
themDr Slop thought he might as well read it under the cover of my
uncle Tobys whistlingas suffer my uncle Toby to read it aloneso
raising up the paper to his face and holding it quite parallel to it
in order to hide his chagrinhe read it aloud as followsmy uncle Toby
whistling Lillabullero though not quite so loud as before

By the authority of God Almighty the Father Son and Holy Ghost and
of the undefiled Virgin Mary mother and patroness of our Saviour and
of all the celestial virtues angels archangels thrones dominions
powers cherubins and seraphins and of all the holy patriarchs
prophets and of all the apostles and evangelists and of the holy
innocents who in the sight of the Holy Lamb are found worthy to sing
the new song of the holy martyrs and holy confessors and of the holy
virgins and of all the saints together with the holy and elect
of GodMay he Obadiah be damnd for tying these knotsWe
excommunicate and anathematize him and from the thresholds of the
holy church of God Almighty we sequester him that he may be tormented
disposed and delivered over with Dathan and Abiram and with those who
say unto the Lord God Depart from us we desire none of thy ways And
as fire is quenched with water so let the light of him be put out for
evermore unless it shall repent him Obadiah of the knots which he
has tied and make satisfaction for them Amen

May the Father who created man curse himMay the Son who suffered
for us curse himMay the Holy Ghost who was given to us in baptism
curse him ObadiahMay the holy cross which Christ for our
salvation triumphing over his enemies ascended curse him

May the holy and eternal Virgin Mary mother of God curse himMay
St Michael the advocate of holy souls curse himMay all the angels
and archangels principalities and powers and all the heavenly armies
curse him Our armies swore terribly in Flanders cried my uncle
Tobybut nothing to thisFor my own part I could not have a heart to
curse my dog so

May St John the Praecursor and St John the Baptist and St Peter
and St Paul and St Andrew and all other Christs apostles together
curse him And may the rest of his disciples and four evangelists who
by their preaching converted the universal world and may the holy and
wonderful company of martyrs and confessors who by their holy works are
found pleasing to God Almighty curse him Obadiah

May the holy choir of the holy virgins who for the honour of Christ
have despised the things of the world damn himMay all the saints
who from the beginning of the world to everlasting ages are found to be
beloved of God damn himMay the heavens and earth and all the holy
things remaining therein damn him Obadiah or her or whoever
else had a hand in tying these knots

May he Obadiah be damnd wherever he bewhether in the house or the
stables the garden or the field or the highway or in the path or
in the wood or in the water or in the churchMay he be cursed in
living in dying Here my uncle Toby taking the advantage of a minim
in the second bar of his tune kept whistling one continued note to the
end of the sentenceDr Slop with his division of curses moving under
him like a running bass all the way May he be cursed in eating and
drinking in being hungry in being thirsty in fasting in sleeping in
slumbering in walking in standing in sitting in lying in working
in resting in pissing in shitting and in bloodletting

May he Obadiah be cursed in all the faculties of his body

May he be cursed inwardly and outwardlyMay he be cursed in the hair
of his headMay he be cursed in his brains and in his vertex that
is a sad curse quoth my father in his temples in his forehead in
his ears in his eyebrows in his cheeks in his jawbones in his
nostrils in his foreteeth and grinders in his lips in his throat in
his shoulders in his wrists in his arms in his hands in his fingers

May he be damnd in his mouth in his breast in his heart and
purtenance down to the very stomach

May he be cursed in his reins and in his groin God in heaven
forbid quoth my uncle Toby in his thighs in his genitals my
father shook his head and in his hips and in his knees his legs and
feet and toenails

May he be cursed in all the joints and articulations of the members
from the top of his head to the sole of his foot May there be no
soundness in him

May the son of the living God with all the glory of his
MajestyHere my uncle Toby throwing back his head gave a monstrous
long loud Whewwwsomething betwixt the interjectional whistle of
Hayday and the word itself

By the golden beard of Jupiterand of Juno if her majesty wore one
and by the beards of the rest of your heathen worships which by the bye
was no small number since what with the beards of your celestial gods
and gods aerial and aquatickto say nothing of the beards of towngods
and countrygods or of the celestial goddesses your wives or of the
infernal goddesses your whores and concubines that is in case they wore
themall which beards as Varro tells me upon his word and honour
when mustered up together made no less than thirty thousand effective
beards upon the Pagan establishmentevery beard of which claimed the
rights and privileges of being stroken and sworn byby all these beards
together thenI vow and protest that of the two bad cassocks I am
worth in the world I would have given the better of them as freely as
ever Cid Hamet offered histo have stood by and heard my uncle Tobys
accompanyment

curse himcontinued Dr Slopand may heaven with all the
powers which move therein rise up against him curse and damn him
Obadiah unless he repent and make satisfaction Amen So be itso
be it Amen

I declare quoth my uncle Toby my heart would not let me curse the
devil himself with so much bitternessHe is the father of curses
replied Dr SlopSo am not I replied my uncleBut he is cursed and
damnd already to all eternity replied Dr Slop

I am sorry for it quoth my uncle Toby

Dr Slop drew up his mouth and was just beginning to return my uncle
Toby the compliment of his Whuuuor interjectional whistlewhen
the door hastily opening in the next chapter but oneput an end to the
affair



Chapter 2V

Now dont let us give ourselves a parcel of airs and pretend that the
oaths we make free with in this land of liberty of ours are our own and
because we have the spirit to swear themimagine that we have had the
wit to invent them too

Ill undertake this moment to prove it to any man in the world except
to a connoisseurthough I declare I object only to a connoisseur in
swearingas I would do to a connoisseur in painting c c the whole
set of em are so hung round and befetishd with the bobs and trinkets
of criticismor to drop my metaphor which by the bye is a pityfor
I have fetchd it as far as from the coast of Guineytheir heads
Sir are stuck so full of rules and compasses and have that eternal
propensity to apply them upon all occasions that a work of genius had
better go to the devil at once than stand to be prickd and tortured to
death by em

And how did Garrick speak the soliloquy last nightOh against all
rule my lordmost ungrammatically betwixt the substantive and the
adjective which should agree together in number case and gender he
made a breach thusstopping as if the point wanted settlingand
betwixt the nominative case which your lordship knows should govern the
verb he suspended his voice in the epilogue a dozen times three
seconds and three fifths by a stop watch my lord each timeAdmirable
grammarianBut in suspending his voicewas the sense suspended
likewise Did no expression of attitude or countenance fill up the
chasmWas the eye silent Did you narrowly lookI lookd only at the
stopwatch my lordExcellent observer

And what of this new book the whole world makes such a rout aboutOh
tis out of all plumb my lordquite an irregular thingnot one of
the angles at the four corners was a right angleI had my rule and
compasses c my lord in my pocketExcellent critick

And for the epick poem your lordship bid me look atupon taking the
length breadth height and depth of it and trying them at home
upon an exact scale of Bossustis out my lord in every one of its
dimensionsAdmirable connoisseur

And did you step in to take a look at the grand picture in your way
backTis a melancholy daub my lord not one principle of the pyramid
in any one groupand what a pricefor there is nothing of the
colouring of Titianthe expression of Rubensthe grace of Raphaelthe
purity of Dominichinothe corregiescity of Corregiothe learning of
Poussinthe airs of Guidothe taste of the Carrachisor the grand
contour of AngeloGrant me patience just HeavenOf all the cants
which are canted in this canting worldthough the cant of hypocrites
may be the worstthe cant of criticism is the most tormenting

I would go fifty miles on foot for I have not a horse worth riding on
to kiss the hand of that man whose generous heart will give up the reins
of his imagination into his authors handsbe pleased he knows not why
and cares not wherefore

Great Apollo if thou art in a giving humourgive meI ask no more
but one stroke of native humour with a single spark of thy own fire
along with itand send Mercury with the rules and compasses if he can
be spared with my compliments tono matter

Now to any one else I will undertake to prove that all the oaths and
imprecations which we have been puffing off upon the world for these
two hundred and fifty years last past as originalsexcept St Pauls
thumbGods flesh and Gods fish which were oaths monarchical and
considering who made them not much amiss and as kings oaths tis not
much matter whether they were fish or fleshelse I say there is not
an oath or at least a curse amongst them which has not been copied
over and over again out of Ernulphus a thousand times but like all
other copies how infinitely short of the force and spirit of the
originalit is thought to be no bad oathand by itself passes very
wellGd damn youSet it beside ErnulphussGod almighty the
Father damn youGod the Son damn youGod the Holy Ghost damn youyou
see tis nothingThere is an orientality in his we cannot rise up
to besides he is more copious in his inventionpossessd more of the
excellencies of a swearerhad such a thorough knowledge of the human
frame its membranes nerves ligaments knittings of the joints and
articulationsthat when Ernulphus cursedno part escaped himTis
true there is something of a hardness in his mannerand as in Michael
Angelo a want of gracebut then there is such a greatness of gusto

My father who generally lookd upon every thing in a light very
different from all mankind would after all never allow this to be an
originalHe considered rather Ernulphuss anathema as an institute
of swearing in which as he suspected upon the decline of swearing in
some milder pontificate Ernulphus by order of the succeeding pope
had with great learning and diligence collected together all the laws of
itfor the same reason that Justinian in the decline of the empire
had ordered his chancellor Tribonian to collect the Roman or civil
laws all together into one code or digestlest through the rust of
timeand the fatality of all things committed to oral traditionthey
should be lost to the world for ever

For this reason my father would ofttimes affirm there was not an oath
from the great and tremendous oath of William the conqueror By the
splendour of God down to the lowest oath of a scavenger Damn your
eyes which was not to be found in ErnulphusIn short he would addI
defy a man to swear out of it

The hypothesis is like most of my fathers singular and ingenious
toonor have I any objection to it but that it overturns my own



Chapter 2VI

Bless my soulmy poor mistress is ready to faintand her pains are
goneand the drops are doneand the bottle of julap is brokeand the
nurse has cut her armand I my thumb cried Dr Slop and the
child is where it was continued Susannahand the midwife has fallen
backwards upon the edge of the fender and bruised her hip as black as
your hatIll look at it quoth Dr SlopThere is no need of that
replied Susannahyou had better look at my mistressbut the midwife
would gladly first give you an account how things are so desires you
would go up stairs and speak to her this moment

Human nature is the same in all professions

The midwife had just before been put over Dr Slops headHe had not
digested itNo replied Dr Slop twould be full as proper if
the midwife came down to meI like subordination quoth my uncle
Tobyand but for it after the reduction of Lisle I know not what
might have become of the garrison of Ghent in the mutiny for bread
in the year TenNor replied Dr Slop parodying my uncle Tobys
hobbyhorsical reflection though full as hobbyhorsical himselfdo
I know Captain Shandy what might have become of the garrison above
stairs in the mutiny and confusion I find all things are in at present
but for the subordination of fingers and thumbs tothe application
of which Sir under this accident of mine comes in so a propos that
without it the cut upon my thumb might have been felt by the Shandy
family as long as the Shandy family had a name



Chapter 2VII

Let us go back to thein the last chapter

It is a singular stroke of eloquence at least it was so when eloquence
flourished at Athens and Rome and would be so now did orators wear
mantles not to mention the name of a thing when you had the thing
about you in petto ready to produce pop in the place you want it A
scar an axe a sword a pinkd doublet a rusty helmet a pound and a
half of potashes in an urn or a threehalfpenny pickle potbut above
all a tender infant royally accoutredTho if it was too young and
the oration as long as Tullys second Philippickit must certainly have
beshit the orators mantleAnd then again if too oldit must have
been unwieldly and incommodious to his actionso as to make him lose
by his child almost as much as he could gain by itOtherwise when a
state orator has hit the precise age to a minutehid his Bambino in his
mantle so cunningly that no mortal could smell itand produced it so
critically that no soul could say it came in by head and shouldersOh
Sirs it has done wondersIt has opend the sluices and turnd the
brains and shook the principles and unhinged the politicks of half a
nation

These feats however are not to be done except in those states and
times I say where orators wore mantlesand pretty large ones too
my brethren with some twenty or fiveandtwenty yards of good purple
superfine marketable cloth in themwith large flowing folds and
doubles and in a great style of designAll which plainly shews may
it please your worships that the decay of eloquence and the little
good service it does at present both within and without doors is
owing to nothing else in the world but short coats and the disuse of
trunkhoseWe can conceal nothing under ours Madam worth shewing



Chapter 2VIII

Dr Slop was within an ace of being an exception to all this
argumentation for happening to have his green baize bag upon his knees
when he began to parody my uncle Tobytwas as good as the best mantle
in the world to him for which purpose when he foresaw the sentence
would end in his newinvented forceps he thrust his hand into the bag
in order to have them ready to clap in when your reverences took so
much notice of the which had he managedmy uncle Toby had certainly
been overthrown the sentence and the argument in that case jumping
closely in one point so like the two lines which form the salient angle
of a ravelinDr Slop would never have given them upand my uncle
Toby would as soon have thought of flying as taking them by force but
Dr Slop fumbled so vilely in pulling them out it took off the whole
effect and what was a ten times worse evil for they seldom come alone
in this life in pulling out his forceps his forceps unfortunately drew
out the squirt along with it

When a proposition can be taken in two sensestis a law in
disputation That the respondent may reply to which of the two he
pleases or finds most convenient for himThis threw the advantage of
the argument quite on my uncle Tobys sideGood God cried my uncle
Toby are children brought into the world with a squirt



Chapter 2IX

Upon my honour Sir you have tore every bit of skin quite off the
back of both my hands with your forceps cried my uncle Tobyand you
have crushd all my knuckles into the bargain with them to a jelly Tis
your own fault said Dr Slopyou should have clinchd your two fists
together into the form of a childs head as I told you and sat firmI
did so answered my uncle TobyThen the points of my forceps have not
been sufficiently armd or the rivet wants closingor else the cut on
my thumb has made me a little aukwardor possiblyTis well quoth my
father interrupting the detail of possibilitiesthat the experiment
was not first made upon my childs headpieceIt would not have been a
cherrystone the worse answered Dr SlopI maintain it said my uncle
Toby it would have broke the cerebellum unless indeed the skull
had been as hard as a granado and turnd it all into a perfect
possetPshaw replied Dr Slop a childs head is naturally as soft
as the pap of an applethe sutures give wayand besides I could
have extracted by the feet afterNot you said sheI rather wish you
would begin that way quoth my father

Pray do added my uncle Toby



Chapter 2X

And pray good woman after all will you take upon you to say it
may not be the childs hip as well as the childs headTis most
certainly the head replied the midwife Because continued Dr Slop
turning to my father as positive as these old ladies generally
aretis a point very difficult to knowand yet of the greatest
consequence to be knownbecause Sir if the hip is mistaken for the
headthere is a possibility if it is a boy that the forceps

What the possibility was Dr Slop whispered very low to my father
and then to my uncle TobyThere is no such danger continued he with
the headNo in truth quoth my fatherbut when your possibility has
taken place at the hipyou may as well take off the head too

It is morally impossible the reader should understand thistis
enough Dr Slop understood itso taking the green baize bag in his
hand with the help of Obadiahs pumps he trippd pretty nimbly for
a man of his size across the room to the doorand from the door was
shewn the way by the good old midwife to my mothers apartments



Chapter 2XI

It is two hours and ten minutesand no morecried my father looking
at his watch since Dr Slop and Obadiah arrivedand I know not how it
happens Brother Tobybut to my imagination it seems almost an age

Herepray Sir take hold of my capnay take the bell along with
it and my pantoufles too

Now Sir they are all at your service and I freely make you a present
of em on condition you give me all your attention to this chapter

Though my father said he knew not how it happendyet he knew
very well how it happendand at the instant he spoke it was
predetermined in his mind to give my uncle Toby a clear account of the
matter by a metaphysical dissertation upon the subject of duration and
its simple modes in order to shew my uncle Toby by what mechanism and
mensurations in the brain it came to pass that the rapid succession of
their ideas and the eternal scampering of the discourse from one thing
to another since Dr Slop had come into the room had lengthened out
so short a period to so inconceivable an extentI know not how it
happenscried my fatherbut it seems an age

Tis owing entirely quoth my uncle Toby to the succession of our
ideas

My father who had an itch in common with all philosophers of
reasoning upon every thing which happened and accounting for it
tooproposed infinite pleasure to himself in this of the succession of
ideas and had not the least apprehension of having it snatchd out of
his hands by my uncle Toby who honest man generally took every thing
as it happenedand who of all things in the world troubled his brain
the least with abstruse thinkingthe ideas of time and spaceor how
we came by those ideasor of what stuff they were madeor whether they
were born with usor we picked them up afterwards as we went alongor
whether we did it in frocksor not till we had got into breecheswith
a thousand other inquiries and disputes about Infinity Prescience
Liberty Necessity and so forth upon whose desperate and unconquerable
theories so many fine heads have been turned and crackednever did my
uncle Tobys the least injury at all my father knew itand was no less
surprized than he was disappointed with my uncles fortuitous solution

Do you understand the theory of that affair replied my father

Not I quoth my uncle

But you have some ideas said my father of what you talk about

No more than my horse replied my uncle Toby

Gracious heaven cried my father looking upwards and clasping his
two hands togetherthere is a worth in thy honest ignorance brother
Tobytwere almost a pity to exchange it for a knowledgeBut Ill
tell thee

To understand what time is aright without which we never can comprehend
infinity insomuch as one is a portion of the otherwe ought seriously
to sit down and consider what idea it is we have of duration so as
to give a satisfactory account how we came by itWhat is that to any
body quoth my uncle Toby Vide Locke For if you will turn your eyes
inwards upon your mind continued my father and observe attentively
you will perceive brother that whilst you and I are talking together
and thinking and smoking our pipes or whilst we receive successively
ideas in our minds we know that we do exist and so we estimate the
existence or the continuation of the existence of ourselves or any
thing else commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds
the duration of ourselves or any such other thing coexisting with our
thinkingand so according to that preconceivedYou puzzle me to death
cried my uncle Toby

Tis owing to this replied my father that in our computations of
time we are so used to minutes hours weeks and monthsand of clocks
I wish there was not a clock in the kingdom to measure out their
several portions to us and to those who belong to usthat twill be
well if in time to come the succession of our ideas be of any use or
service to us at all

Now whether we observe it or no continued my father in every sound
mans head there is a regular succession of ideas of one sort or other
which follow each other in train just likeA train of artillery said
my uncle TobyA train of a fiddlestickquoth my fatherwhich follow
and succeed one another in our minds at certain distances just like
the images in the inside of a lanthorn turned round by the heat of
a candleI declare quoth my uncle Toby mine are more like a
smokejackThen brother Toby I have nothing more to say to you upon
that subject said my father



Chapter 2XII

What a conjuncture was here lostMy father in one of his best
explanatory moodsin eager pursuit of a metaphysical point into
the very regions where clouds and thick darkness would soon have
encompassed it aboutmy uncle Toby in one of the finest dispositions
for it in the worldhis head like a smokejackthe funnel unswept
and the ideas whirling round and round about in it all obfuscated and
darkened over with fuliginous matterBy the tombstone of Lucianif
it is in beingif not why then by his ashes by the ashes of my dear
Rabelais and dearer Cervantesmy father and my uncle Tobys discourse
upon Time and Eternitywas a discourse devoutly to be wished for and
the petulancy of my fathers humour in putting a stop to it as he did
was a robbery of the Ontologic Treasury of such a jewel as no coalition
of great occasions and great men are ever likely to restore to it again



Chapter 2XIII

Tho my father persisted in not going on with the discourseyet he
could not get my uncle Tobys smokejack out of his headpiqued as
he was at first with itthere was something in the comparison at the
bottom which hit his fancy for which purpose resting his elbow upon
the table and reclining the right side of his head upon the palm of his
handbut looking first stedfastly in the firehe began to commune with
himself and philosophize about it but his spirits being wore out with
the fatigues of investigating new tracts and the constant exertion of
his faculties upon that variety of subjects which had taken their turn
in the discoursethe idea of the smoke jack soon turned all his ideas
upside downso that he fell asleep almost before he knew what he was
about

As for my uncle Toby his smokejack had not made a dozen revolutions
before he fell asleep alsoPeace be with them bothDr Slop is
engaged with the midwife and my mother above stairsTrim is busy
in turning an old pair of jackboots into a couple of mortars to be
employed in the siege of Messina next summerand is this instant boring
the touchholes with the point of a hot pokerAll my heroes are off my
handstis the first time I have had a moment to spareand Ill make
use of it and write my preface


The Authors Preface

No Ill not say a word about ithere it isin publishing itI have
appealed to the worldand to the world I leave itit must speak for
itself

All I know of the matter iswhen I sat down my intent was to write
a good book and as far as the tenuity of my understanding would hold
outa wise aye and a discreettaking care only as I went along to
put into it all the wit and the judgment be it more or less which the
great Author and Bestower of them had thought fit originally to give
meso that as your worships seetis just as God pleases

Now Agalastes speaking dispraisingly sayeth That there may be some
wit in it for aught he knowsbut no judgment at all And Triptolemus
and Phutatorius agreeing thereto ask How is it possible there should
for that wit and judgment in this world never go together inasmuch as
they are two operations differing from each other as wide as east from
westSo says Lockeso are farting and hickuping say I But in answer
to this Didius the great church lawyer in his code de fartendi et
illustrandi fallaciis doth maintain and make fully appear That
an illustration is no argumentnor do I maintain the wiping of a
lookingglass clean to be a syllogismbut you all may it please your
worships see the better for itso that the main good these things do
is only to clarify the understanding previous to the application of the
argument itself in order to free it from any little motes or specks
of opacular matter which if left swimming therein might hinder a
conception and spoil all

Now my dear antiShandeans and thrice able criticks and
fellowlabourers for to you I write this Prefaceand to you most
subtle statesmen and discreet doctors dopull off your beards
renowned for gravity and wisdomMonopolus my politicianDidius my
counsel Kysarcius my friendPhutatorius my guideGastripheres
the preserver of my life Somnolentius the balm and repose of itnot
forgetting all others as well sleeping as waking ecclesiastical as
civil whom for brevity but out of no resentment to you I lump all
togetherBelieve me right worthy

My most zealous wish and fervent prayer in your behalf and in my own
too in case the thing is not done already for usis that the great
gifts and endowments both of wit and judgment with every thing which
usually goes along with themsuch as memory fancy genius eloquence
quick parts and what not may this precious moment without stint or
measure let or hindrance be poured down warm as each of us could bear
itscum and sediment and all for I would not have a drop lost into
the several receptacles cells cellules domiciles dormitories
refectories and spare places of our brainsin such sort that they
might continue to be injected and tunnd into according to the true
intent and meaning of my wish until every vessel of them both great
and small be so replenishd saturated and filled up therewith that
no more would it save a mans life could possibly be got either in or
out

Bless uswhat noble work we should makehow should I tickle it
offand what spirits should I find myself in to be writing away for
such readersand youjust heavenwith what raptures would you sit
and readbut ohtis too muchI am sickI faint away deliciously at
the thoughts of ittis more than nature can bearlay hold of
meI am giddyI am stone blindIm dyingI am goneHelp Help
HelpBut holdI grow something better again for I am beginning to
foresee when this is over that as we shall all of us continue to
be great witswe should never agree amongst ourselves one day to an
endthere would be so much satire and sarcasmscoffing and flouting
with raillying and reparteeing of itthrusting and parrying in one
corner or anotherthere would be nothing but mischief among usChaste
stars what biting and scratching and what a racket and a clatter
we should make what with breaking of heads rapping of knuckles and
hitting of sore placesthere would be no such thing as living for us

But then again as we should all of us be men of great judgment we
should make up matters as fast as ever they went wrong and though
we should abominate each other ten times worse than so many devils or
devilesses we should nevertheless my dear creatures be all courtesy
and kindness milk and honeytwould be a second land of promisea
paradise upon earth if there was such a thing to be hadso that upon
the whole we should have done well enough

All I fret and fume at and what most distresses my invention at
present is how to bring the point itself to bear for as your worships
well know that of these heavenly emanations of wit and judgment which
I have so bountifully wished both for your worships and myselfthere
is but a certain quantum stored up for us all for the use and behoof of
the whole race of mankind and such small modicums of em are only sent
forth into this wide world circulating here and there in one bye corner
or anotherand in such narrow streams and at such prodigious intervals
from each other that one would wonder how it holds out or could be
sufficient for the wants and emergencies of so many great estates and
populous empires

Indeed there is one thing to be considered that in Nova Zembla North
Lapland and in all those cold and dreary tracks of the globe which lie
more directly under the arctick and antartick circles where the whole
province of a mans concernments lies for near nine months together
within the narrow compass of his cavewhere the spirits are compressed
almost to nothingand where the passions of a man with every thing
which belongs to them are as frigid as the zone itselfthere the least
quantity of judgment imaginable does the businessand of witthere is
a total and an absolute savingfor as not one spark is wantedso not
one spark is given Angels and ministers of grace defend us what a
dismal thing would it have been to have governed a kingdom to have
fought a battle or made a treaty or run a match or wrote a book or
got a child or held a provincial chapter there with so plentiful a
lack of wit and judgment about us For mercys sake let us think
no more about it but travel on as fast as we can southwards into
Norwaycrossing over Swedeland if you please through the small
triangular province of Angermania to the lake of Bothmia coasting along
it through east and west Bothnia down to Carelia and so on through
all those states and provinces which border upon the far side of the
Gulf of Finland and the northeast of the Baltick up to Petersbourg
and just stepping into Ingriathen stretching over directly from
thence through the north parts of the Russian empireleaving Siberia
a little upon the left hand till we got into the very heart of Russian
and Asiatick Tartary

Now through this long tour which I have led you you observe the good
people are better off by far than in the polar countries which we have
just leftfor if you hold your hand over your eyes and look very
attentively you may perceive some small glimmerings as it were of
wit with a comfortable provision of good plain houshold judgment
which taking the quality and quantity of it together they make a very
good shift withand had they more of either the one or the other
it would destroy the proper balance betwixt them and I am satisfied
moreover they would want occasions to put them to use

Now Sir if I conduct you home again into this warmer and more
luxuriant island where you perceive the springtide of our blood and
humours runs highwhere we have more ambition and pride and envy
and lechery and other whoreson passions upon our hands to govern and
subject to reasonthe height of our wit and the depth of our judgment
you see are exactly proportioned to the length and breadth of our
necessitiesand accordingly we have them sent down amongst us in such a
flowing kind of decent and creditable plenty that no one thinks he has
any cause to complain

It must however be confessed on this head that as our air blows hot
and coldwet and dry ten times in a day we have them in no regular
and settled wayso that sometimes for near half a century together
there shall be very little wit or judgment either to be seen or heard of
amongst usthe small channels of them shall seem quite dried upthen
all of a sudden the sluices shall break out and take a fit of running
again like furyyou would think they would never stopand then it is
that in writing and fighting and twenty other gallant things we drive
all the world before us

It is by these observations and a wary reasoning by analogy in
that kind of argumentative process which Suidas calls dialectick
inductionthat I draw and set up this position as most true and
veritable

That of these two luminaries so much of their irradiations are suffered
from time to time to shine down upon us as he whose infinite wisdom
which dispenses every thing in exact weight and measure knows will just
serve to light us on our way in this night of our obscurity so that
your reverences and worships now find out nor is it a moment longer in
my power to conceal it from you That the fervent wish in your behalf
with which I set out was no more than the first insinuating How dye of
a caressing prefacer stifling his reader as a lover sometimes does a
coy mistress into silence For alas could this effusion of light have
been as easily procured as the exordium wished itI tremble to think
how many thousands for it of benighted travellers in the learned
sciences at least must have groped and blundered on in the dark
all the nights of their livesrunning their heads against posts
and knocking out their brains without ever getting to their journies
endsome falling with their noses perpendicularly into sinksothers
horizontally with their tails into kennels Here one half of a learned
profession tilting full but against the other half of it and then
tumbling and rolling one over the other in the dirt like hogsHere
the brethren of another profession who should have run in opposition to
each other flying on the contrary like a flock of wild geese all in
a row the same wayWhat confusionwhat mistakesfiddlers and

years finding food and raiment all that term for a centumvirate of the
profession

As for the ClergyNoif I say a word against them Ill be shotI
have no desire and besides if I hadI durst not for my soul touch
upon the subjectwith such weak nerves and spirits and in the
condition I am in at present twould be as much as my life was worth
to deject and contrist myself with so bad and melancholy an accountand
therefore tis safer to draw a curtain across and hasten from it as
fast as I can to the main and principal point I have undertaken to
clear upand that is How it comes to pass that your men of least wit
are reported to be men of most judgmentBut markI say reported
to befor it is no more my dear Sirs than a report and which like
twenty others taken up every day upon trust I maintain to be a vile and
a malicious report into the bargain

This by the help of the observation already premised and I hope already
weighed and perpended by your reverences and worships I shall forthwith
make appear

I hate set dissertationsand above all things in the world tis one of
the silliest things in one of them to darken your hypothesis by placing
a number of tall opake words one before another in a right line
betwixt your own and your readers conceptionwhen in all likelihood
if you had looked about you might have seen something standing or
hanging up which would have cleared the point at oncefor what
hindrance hurt or harm doth the laudable desire of knowledge bring to
any man if even from a sot a pot a fool a stool a wintermittain
a truckle for a pully the lid of a goldsmiths crucible an oil bottle
an old slipper or a cane chairI am this moment sitting upon one
Will you give me leave to illustrate this affair of wit and judgment by
the two knobs on the top of the back of itthey are fastened on you
see with two pegs stuck slightly into two gimletholes and will place
what I have to say in so clear a light as to let you see through the
drift and meaning of my whole preface as plainly as if every point and
particle of it was made up of sunbeams

I enter now directly upon the point

Here stands witand there stands judgment close beside it just like
the two knobs Im speaking of upon the back of this selfsame chair on
which I am sitting

You see they are the highest and most ornamental parts of its
frameas wit and judgment are of oursand like them too indubitably
both made and fitted to go together in order as we say in all such
cases of duplicated embellishmentsto answer one another

Now for the sake of an experiment and for the clearer illustrating this
matterlet us for a moment take off one of these two curious ornaments
I care not which from the point or pinnacle of the chair it now stands
onnay dont laugh at itbut did you ever see in the whole course
of your lives such a ridiculous business as this has made of itWhy
tis as miserable a sight as a sow with one ear and there is just as
much sense and symmetry in the one as in the otherdopray get off
your seats only to take a view of itNow would any man who valued his
character a straw have turned a piece of work out of his hand in such a
conditionnay lay your hands upon your hearts and answer this plain
question Whether this one single knob which now stands here like a
blockhead by itself can serve any purpose upon earth but to put one
in mind of the want of the otherand let me farther ask in case the
chair was your own if you would not in your consciences think rather
than be as it is that it would be ten times better without any knob at
all

Now these two knobsor top ornaments of the mind of man which crown
the whole entablaturebeing as I said wit and judgment which of all
others as I have proved it are the most needfulthe most prizdthe
most calamitous to be without and consequently the hardest to come
atfor all these reasons put together there is not a mortal among us
so destitute of a love of good fame or feedingor so ignorant of what
will do him good thereinwho does not wish and stedfastly resolve in
his own mind to be or to be thought at least master of the one or the
other and indeed of both of them if the thing seems any way feasible
or likely to be brought to pass

Now your graver gentry having little or no kind of chance in aiming at
the oneunless they laid hold of the otherpray what do you think
would become of themWhy Sirs in spite of all their gravities
they must een have been contented to have gone with their insides
nakedthis was not to be borne but by an effort of philosophy not to
be supposed in the case we are uponso that no one could well have been
angry with them had they been satisfied with what little they could
have snatched up and secreted under their cloaks and great perriwigs
had they not raised a hue and cry at the same time against the lawful
owners

I need not tell your worships that this was done with so much cunning
and artificethat the great Locke who was seldom outwitted by false
soundswas nevertheless bubbled here The cry it seems was so deep
and solemn a one and what with the help of great wigs grave faces and
other implements of deceit was rendered so general a one against the
poor wits in this matter that the philosopher himself was deceived by
itit was his glory to free the world from the lumber of a thousand
vulgar errorsbut this was not of the number so that instead of
sitting down coolly as such a philosopher should have done to have
examined the matter of fact before he philosophised upon iton the
contrary he took the fact for granted and so joined in with the cry
and hallood it as boisterously as the rest

This has been made the Magna Charta of stupidity ever sincebut your
reverences plainly see it has been obtained in such a manner that the
title to it is not worth a groatwhich bythebye is one of the many
and vile impositions which gravity and grave folks have to answer for
hereafter

As for great wigs upon which I may be thought to have spoken my mind
too freelyI beg leave to qualify whatever has been unguardedly said to
their dispraise or prejudice by one general declarationThat I have
no abhorrence whatever nor do I detest and abjure either great wigs or
long beards any farther than when I see they are bespoke and let grow
on purpose to carry on this selfsame imposturefor any purposepeace
be with them mark onlyI write not for them



Chapter 2XIV

Every day for at least ten years together did my father resolve to have
it mendedtis not mended yetno family but ours would have borne
with it an hourand what is most astonishing there was not a subject
in the world upon which my father was so eloquent as upon that of
doorhingesAnd yet at the same time he was certainly one of the
greatest bubbles to them I think that history can produce his
rhetorick and conduct were at perpetual handycuffsNever did the
parlourdoor openbut his philosophy or his principles fell a victim to
itthree drops of oil with a feather and a smart stroke of a hammer
had saved his honour for ever

Inconsistent soul that man islanguishing under wounds which he
has the power to healhis whole life a contradiction to his
knowledgehis reason that precious gift of God to himinstead of
pouring in oil serving but to sharpen his sensibilitiesto multiply
his pains and render him more melancholy and uneasy under themPoor
unhappy creature that he should do soAre not the necessary causes of
misery in this life enow but he must add voluntary ones to his stock of
sorrowstruggle against evils which cannot be avoided and submit to
others which a tenth part of the trouble they create him would remove
from his heart for ever

By all that is good and virtuous if there are three drops of oil to
be got and a hammer to be found within ten miles of Shandy Hallthe
parlour door hinge shall be mended this reign



Chapter 2XV

When Corporal Trim had brought his two mortars to bear he was delighted
with his handywork above measure and knowing what a pleasure it would
be to his master to see them he was not able to resist the desire he
had of carrying them directly into his parlour

Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the affair of
hinges I had a speculative consideration arising out of it and it is
this

Had the parlour door opened and turnd upon its hinges as a door should
do

Or for example as cleverly as our government has been turning upon
its hingesthat is in case things have all along gone well with your
worshipotherwise I give up my similein this case I say there had
been no danger either to master or man in corporal Trims peeping in
the moment he had beheld my father and my uncle Toby fast asleepthe
respectfulness of his carriage was such he would have retired as silent
as death and left them both in their armchairs dreaming as happy
as he had found them but the thing was morally speaking so very
impracticable that for the many years in which this hinge was suffered
to be out of order and amongst the hourly grievances my father
submitted to upon its accountthis was one that he never folded his
arms to take his nap after dinner but the thoughts of being unavoidably
awakened by the first person who should open the door was always
uppermost in his imagination and so incessantly steppd in betwixt him
and the first balmy presage of his repose as to rob him as he often
declared of the whole sweets of it

When things move upon bad hinges an please your lordships how can it
be otherwise

Pray whats the matter Who is there cried my father waking the
moment the door began to creakI wish the smith would give a peep at
that confounded hingeTis nothing an please your honour said Trim
but two mortars I am bringing inThey shant make a clatter with them
here cried my father hastilyIf Dr Slop has any drugs to pound let
him do it in the kitchenMay it please your honour cried Trim they
are two mortarpieces for a siege next summer which I have been making
out of a pair of jackboots which Obadiah told me your honour had left
off wearingBy Heaven cried my father springing out of his chair
as he sworeI have not one appointment belonging to me which I set
so much store by as I do by these jackbootsthey were our great
grandfathers brother Tobythey were hereditary Then I fear quoth my
uncle Toby Trim has cut off the entailI have only cut off the tops
an please your honour cried TrimI hate perpetuities as much as any
man alive cried my fatherbut these jackboots continued he smiling
though very angry at the same time have been in the family brother
ever since the civil warsSir Roger Shandy wore them at the battle
of MarstonMoorI declare I would not have taken ten pounds for
themIll pay you the money brother Shandy quoth my uncle Toby
looking at the two mortars with infinite pleasure and putting his hand
into his breeches pocket as he viewed themIll pay you the ten pounds
this moment with all my heart and soul

Brother Toby replied my father altering his tone you care not what
money you dissipate and throw away provided continued he tis but
upon a SiegeHave I not one hundred and twenty pounds a year besides
my half pay cried my uncle TobyWhat is thatreplied my father
hastilyto ten pounds for a pair of jackbootstwelve guineas for
your pontoonshalf as much for your Dutch drawbridgeto say nothing
of the train of little brass artillery you bespoke last week with
twenty other preparations for the siege of Messina believe me dear
brother Toby continued my father taking him kindly by the handthese
military operations of yours are above your strengthyou mean well
brotherbut they carry you into greater expences than you were first
aware ofand take my word dear Toby they will in the end quite ruin
your fortune and make a beggar of youWhat signifies it if they do
brother replied my uncle Toby so long as we know tis for the good of
the nation

My father could not help smiling for his soulhis anger at the worst
was never more than a sparkand the zeal and simplicity of Trimand
the generous though hobbyhorsical gallantry of my uncle Toby brought
him into perfect good humour with them in an instant

Generous soulsGod prosper you both and your mortarpieces too quoth
my father to himself



Chapter 2XVI

All is quiet and hush cried my father at least above stairsI hear
not one foot stirringPrithee Trim whos in the kitchen There is no
one soul in the kitchen answered Trim making a low bow as he spoke
except Dr SlopConfusion cried my father getting upon his legs a
second timenot one single thing has gone right this day had I faith
in astrology brother which by the bye my father had I would have
sworn some retrograde planet was hanging over this unfortunate house of
mine and turning every individual thing in it out of its placeWhy
I thought Dr Slop had been above stairs with my wife and so said
youWhat can the fellow be puzzling about in the kitchenHe is busy
an please your honour replied Trim in making a bridgeTis very
obliging in him quoth my uncle Tobypray give my humble service to
Dr Slop Trim and tell him I thank him heartily

You must know my uncle Toby mistook the bridgeas widely as my father
mistook the mortarsbut to understand how my uncle Toby could mistake
the bridgeI fear I must give you an exact account of the road which
led to itor to drop my metaphor for there is nothing more dishonest
in an historian than the use of onein order to conceive the
probability of this error in my uncle Toby aright I must give you some
account of an adventure of Trims though much against my will I say
much against my will only because the story in one sense is certainly
out of its place here for by right it should come in either amongst
the anecdotes of my uncle Tobys amours with widow Wadman in which
corporal Trim was no mean actoror else in the middle of his and my
uncle Tobys campaigns on the bowlinggreenfor it will do very well in
either placebut then if I reserve it for either of those parts of my
storyI ruin the story Im uponand if I tell it hereI anticipate
matters and ruin it there

What would your worship have me to do in this case

Tell it Mr Shandy by all meansYou are a fool Tristram if you
do

O ye powers for powers ye are and great ones toowhich enable
mortal man to tell a story worth the hearingthat kindly shew him
where he is to begin itand where he is to end itwhat he is to put
into itand what he is to leave outhow much of it he is to cast into
a shadeand whereabouts he is to throw his lightYe who preside over
this vast empire of biographical freebooters and see how many scrapes
and plunges your subjects hourly fall intowill you do one thing

I beg and beseech you in case you will do nothing better for us that
wherever in any part of your dominions it so falls out that three
several roads meet in one point as they have done just herethat at
least you set up a guidepost in the centre of them in mere charity to
direct an uncertain devil which of the three he is to take



Chapter 2XVII

Tho the shock my uncle Toby received the year after the demolition of
Dunkirk in his affair with widow Wadman had fixed him in a resolution
never more to think of the sexor of aught which belonged to ityet
corporal Trim had made no such bargain with himself Indeed in my
uncle Tobys case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of
circumstances which insensibly drew him in to lay siege to that fair
and strong citadelIn Trims case there was a concurrence of nothing
in the world but of him and Bridget in the kitchenthough in truth
the love and veneration he bore his master was such and so fond was he
of imitating him in all he did that had my uncle Toby employed his
time and genius in tagging of pointsI am persuaded the honest corporal
would have laid down his arms and followed his example with pleasure
When therefore my uncle Toby sat down before the mistresscorporal Trim
incontinently took ground before the maid

Now my dear friend Garrick whom I have so much cause to esteem
and honourwhy or wherefore tis no mattercan it escape your
penetrationI defy itthat so many playwrights and opificers of
chitchat have ever since been working upon Trims and my uncle Tobys
patternI care not what Aristotle or Pacuvius or Bossu or
Ricaboni saythough I never read one of themthere is not a greater
difference between a singlehorse chair and madam Pompadours visavis
than betwixt a single amour and an amour thus nobly doubled and going
upon all four prancing throughout a grand dramaSir a simple single
silly affair of that kindis quite lost in five actsbut that is
neither here nor there

After a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine months on my
uncle Tobys quarter a most minute account of every particular of which
shall be given in its proper place my uncle Toby honest man found
it necessary to draw off his forces and raise the siege somewhat
indignantly

Corporal Trim as I said had made no such bargain either with
himselfor with any one elsethe fidelity however of his heart not
suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken with
disgusthe contented himself with turning his part of the siege into a
blockadethat is he kept others offfor though he never after went
to the house yet he never met Bridget in the village but he
would either nod or wink or smile or look kindly at heror as
circumstances directed he would shake her by the handor ask her
lovingly how she didor would give her a ribbonand nowandthen
though never but when it could be done with decorum would give Bridget
a

Precisely in this situation did these things stand for five years that
is from the demolition of Dunkirk in the year 13 to the latter end of
my uncle Tobys campaign in the year 18 which was about six or seven
weeks before the time Im speaking ofWhen Trim as his custom was
after he had put my uncle Toby to bed going down one moonshiny night
to see that every thing was right at his fortificationsin the lane
separated from the bowlinggreen with flowering shrubs and hollyhe
espied his Bridget

As the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well worth
shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle Toby had made Trim
courteously and gallantly took her by the hand and led her in this was
not done so privately but that the foulmouthd trumpet of Fame carried
it from ear to ear till at length it reachd my fathers with this
untoward circumstance along with it that my uncle Tobys curious
drawbridge constructed and painted after the Dutch fashion and
which went quite across the ditchwas broke down and somehow or other
crushed all to pieces that very night

My father as you have observed had no great esteem for my uncle Tobys
hobbyhorse he thought it the most ridiculous horse that ever gentleman
mounted and indeed unless my uncle Toby vexed him about it could never
think of it once without smiling at itso that it could never get lame
or happen any mischance but it tickled my fathers imagination beyond
measure but this being an accident much more to his humour than any
one which had yet befalln it it proved an inexhaustible fund of
entertainment to himWellbut dear Toby my father would say do tell
me seriously how this affair of the bridge happenedHow can you teaze
me so much about it my uncle Toby would replyI have told it you
twenty times word for word as Trim told it mePrithee how was it
then corporal my father would cry turning to TrimIt was a mere
misfortune an please your honourI was shewing Mrs Bridget
our fortifications and in going too near the edge of the fosse I
unfortunately slippd inVery well Trim my father would crysmiling
mysteriously and giving a nodbut without interrupting himand being
linkd fast an please your honour arm in arm with Mrs Bridget I
draggd her after me by means of which she fell backwards soss against
the bridgeand Trims foot my uncle Toby would cry taking the story
out of his mouth getting into the cuvette he tumbled full against the
bridge tooIt was a thousand to one my uncle Toby would add that
the poor fellow did not break his legAy truly my father would saya
limb is soon broke brother Toby in such encountersAnd so an
please your honour the bridge which your honour knows was a very
slight one was broke down betwixt us and splintered all to pieces

At other times but especially when my uncle Toby was so unfortunate
as to say a syllable about cannons bombs or petardsmy father would
exhaust all the stores of his eloquence which indeed were very great
in a panegyric upon the BatteringRams of the ancientsthe Vinea which
Alexander made use of at the siege of TroyHe would tell my uncle Toby
of the Catapultae of the Syrians which threw such monstrous stones
so many hundred feet and shook the strongest bulwarks from their very
foundationhe would go on and describe the wonderful mechanism of
the Ballista which Marcellinus makes so much rout aboutthe terrible
effects of the Pyraboli which cast firethe danger of the Terebra and
Scorpio which cast javelinsBut what are these would he say to the
destructive machinery of corporal TrimBelieve me brother Toby no
bridge or bastion or sallyport that ever was constructed in this
world can hold out against such artillery

My uncle Toby would never attempt any defence against the force of this
ridicule but that of redoubling the vehemence of smoaking his pipe in
doing which he raised so dense a vapour one night after supper that
it set my father who was a little phthisical into a suffocating fit of
violent coughing my uncle Toby leapd up without feeling the pain upon
his groinand with infinite pity stood beside his brothers chair
tapping his back with one hand and holding his head with the other and
from time to time wiping his eyes with a clean cambrick handkerchief
which he pulled out of his pocketThe affectionate and endearing
manner in which my uncle Toby did these little officescut my father
thro his reins for the pain he had just been giving himMay my
brains be knockd out with a batteringram or a catapulta I care not
which quoth my father to himselfif ever I insult this worthy soul
more



Chapter 2XVIII

The drawbridge being held irreparable Trim was ordered directly to
set about anotherbut not upon the same model for cardinal Alberonis
intrigues at that time being discovered and my uncle Toby rightly
foreseeing that a flame would inevitably break out betwixt Spain and
the Empire and that the operations of the ensuing campaign must in all
likelihood be either in Naples or Sicilyhe determined upon an
Italian bridgemy uncle Toby bythebye was not far out of his
conjecturesbut my father who was infinitely the better politician
and took the lead as far of my uncle Toby in the cabinet as my uncle
Toby took it of him in the fieldconvinced him that if the king of
Spain and the Emperor went together by the ears England and France and
Holland must by force of their preengagements all enter the lists
tooand if so he would say the combatants brother Toby as sure
as we are alive will fall to it again pellmell upon the old
prizefighting stage of Flandersthen what will you do with your
Italian bridge

We will go on with it then upon the old model cried my uncle Toby

When corporal Trim had about half finished it in that stylemy uncle
Toby found out a capital defect in it which he had never thoroughly
considered before It turned it seems upon hinges at both ends of
it opening in the middle one half of which turning to one side of the
fosse and the other to the other the advantage of which was this
that by dividing the weight of the bridge into two equal portions it
impowered my uncle Toby to raise it up or let it down with the end of
his crutch and with one hand which as his garrison was weak was
as much as he could well sparebut the disadvantages of such a
construction were insurmountablefor by this means he would say I
leave one half of my bridge in my enemys possessionand pray of what
use is the other

The natural remedy for this was no doubt to have his bridge fast only
at one end with hinges so that the whole might be lifted up together
and stand bolt uprightbut that was rejected for the reason given
above

For a whole week after he was determined in his mind to have one of
that particular construction which is made to draw back horizontally
to hinder a passage and to thrust forwards again to gain a passageof
which sorts your worship might have seen three famous ones at Spires
before its destructionand one now at Brisac if I mistake notbut my
father advising my uncle Toby with great earnestness to have nothing
more to do with thrusting bridgesand my uncle foreseeing moreover
that it would but perpetuate the memory of the Corporals misfortunehe
changed his mind for that of the marquis dHopitals invention which
the younger Bernouilli has so well and learnedly described as your
worships may seeAct Erud Lips an 1695to these a lead weight is
an eternal balance and keeps watch as well as a couple of centinels
inasmuch as the construction of them was a curve line approximating to a
cycloidif not a cycloid itself

My uncle Toby understood the nature of a parabola as well as any man
in Englandbut was not quite such a master of the cycloidhe talked
however about it every daythe bridge went not forwardsWell ask
somebody about it cried my uncle Toby to Trim



Chapter 2XIX

When Trim came in and told my father that Dr Slop was in the kitchen
and busy in making a bridgemy uncle Tobythe affair of the jackboots
having just then raised a train of military ideas in his braintook it
instantly for granted that Dr Slop was making a model of the marquis
dHopitals bridgetis very obliging in him quoth my uncle
Tobypray give my humble service to Dr Slop Trim and tell him I
thank him heartily

Had my uncle Tobys head been a Savoyards box and my father peeping
in all the time at one end of itit could not have given him a more
distinct conception of the operations of my uncle Tobys imagination
than what he had so notwithstanding the catapulta and batteringram
and his bitter imprecation about them he was just beginning to
triumph

When Trims answer in an instant tore the laurel from his brows and
twisted it to pieces



Chapter 2XX

This unfortunate drawbridge of yours quoth my fatherGod bless your
honour cried Trim tis a bridge for masters noseIn bringing him
into the world with his vile instruments he has crushed his nose
Susannah says as flat as a pancake to his face and he is making a
false bridge with a piece of cotton and a thin piece of whalebone out of
Susannahs stays to raise it up

Lead me brother Toby cried my father to my room this instant



Chapter 2XXI

From the first moment I sat down to write my life for the amusement of
the world and my opinions for its instruction has a cloud insensibly
been gathering over my fatherA tide of little evils and distresses
has been setting in against himNot one thing as he observed himself
has gone right and now is the storm thickend and going to break and
pour down full upon his head

I enter upon this part of my story in the most pensive and melancholy
frame of mind that ever sympathetic breast was touched withMy nerves
relax as I tell itEvery line I write I feel an abatement of the
quickness of my pulse and of that careless alacrity with it which
every day of my life prompts me to say and write a thousand things I
should notAnd this moment that I last dippd my pen into my ink I
could not help taking notice what a cautious air of sad composure and
solemnity there appeard in my manner of doing itLord how different
from the rash jerks and hairbraind squirts thou art wont Tristram
to transact it with in other humoursdropping thy penspurting thy ink
about thy table and thy booksas if thy pen and thy ink thy books and
furniture cost thee nothing



Chapter 2XXII

I wont go about to argue the point with youtis soand I am
persuaded of it madam as much as can be That both man and woman
bear pain or sorrow and for aught I know pleasure too best in a
horizontal position

The moment my father got up into his chamber he threw himself prostrate
across his bed in the wildest disorder imaginable but at the same time
in the most lamentable attitude of a man borne down with sorrows that
ever the eye of pity droppd a tear forThe palm of his right hand as
he fell upon the bed receiving his forehead and covering the greatest
part of both his eyes gently sunk down with his head his elbow giving
way backwards till his nose touchd the quilthis left arm hung
insensible over the side of the bed his knuckles reclining upon the
handle of the chamberpot which peepd out beyond the valancehis
right leg his left being drawn up towards his body hung half over the
side of the bed the edge of it pressing upon his shin boneHe felt
it not A fixd inflexible sorrow took possession of every line of his
faceHe sighd onceheaved his breast oftenbut uttered not a word

An old setstitchd chair valanced and fringed around with party
coloured worsted bobs stood at the beds head opposite to the side
where my fathers head reclinedMy uncle Toby sat him down in it

Before an affliction is digestedconsolation ever comes too soonand
after it is digestedit comes too late so that you see madam
there is but a mark between these two as fine almost as a hair for a
comforter to take aim atmy uncle Toby was always either on this side
or on that of it and would often say he believed in his heart he could
as soon hit the longitude for this reason when he sat down in the
chair he drew the curtain a little forwards and having a tear at
every ones servicehe pulld out a cambrick handkerchiefgave a low
sighbut held his peace



Chapter 2XXIII

All is not gain that is got into the purseSo that notwithstanding
my father had the happiness of reading the oddest books in the universe
and had moreover in himself the oddest way of thinking that ever
man in it was blessd with yet it had this drawback upon him after
allthat it laid him open to some of the oddest and most whimsical
distresses of which this particular one which he sunk under at
present is as strong an example as can be given

No doubt the breaking down of the bridge of a childs nose by the edge
of a pair of forcepshowever scientifically appliedwould vex any
man in the world who was at so much pains in begetting a child as
my father wasyet it will not account for the extravagance of his
affliction nor will it justify the unchristian manner he abandoned and
surrendered himself up to

To explain this I must leave him upon the bed for half an hourand my
uncle Toby in his old fringed chair sitting beside him



Chapter 2XXIV

I think it a very unreasonable demandcried my greatgrandfather
twisting up the paper and throwing it upon the tableBy this account
madam you have but two thousand pounds fortune and not a shilling
moreand you insist upon having three hundred pounds a year jointure
for it

Because replied my greatgrandmother you have little or no nose
Sir

Now before I venture to make use of the word Nose a second timeto
avoid all confusion in what will be said upon it in this interesting
part of my story it may not be amiss to explain my own meaning
and define with all possible exactness and precision what I would
willingly be understood to mean by the term being of opinion that tis
owing to the negligence and perverseness of writers in despising this
precaution and to nothing elsethat all the polemical writings in
divinity are not as clear and demonstrative as those upon a Will o the
Wisp or any other sound part of philosophy and natural pursuit in
order to which what have you to do before you set out unless you
intend to go puzzling on to the day of judgmentbut to give the world
a good definition and stand to it of the main word you have most
occasion forchanging it Sir as you would a guinea into small
coinwhich donelet the father of confusion puzzle you if he can or
put a different idea either into your head or your readers head if he
knows how

In books of strict morality and close reasoning such as I am engaged
inthe neglect is inexcusable and Heaven is witness how the world
has revenged itself upon me for leaving so many openings to equivocal
stricturesand for depending so much as I have done all along upon
the cleanliness of my readers imaginations

Here are two senses cried Eugenius as we walkd along pointing
with the fore finger of his right hand to the word Crevice in the one
hundred and seventyeighth page of the first volume of this book of
bookshere are two sensesquoth heAnd here are two roads replied
I turning short upon hima dirty and a clean onewhich shall we
takeThe clean by all means replied Eugenius Eugenius said I
stepping before him and laying my hand upon his breastto defineis
to distrustThus I triumphd over Eugenius but I triumphd over him
as I always do like a foolTis my comfort however I am not an
obstinate one therefore

I define a nose as followsintreating only beforehand and beseeching
my readers both male and female of what age complexion and condition
soever for the love of God and their own souls to guard against the
temptations and suggestions of the devil and suffer him by no art or
wile to put any other ideas into their minds than what I put into my
definitionFor by the word Nose throughout all this long chapter of
noses and in every other part of my work where the word Nose occursI
declare by that word I mean a nose and nothing more or less



Chapter 2XXV

Because quoth my great grandmother repeating the words againyou
have little or no nose Sir

Sdeath cried my greatgrandfather clapping his hand upon his
nosetis not so small as that comes totis a full inch longer than
my fathersNow my greatgrandfathers nose was for all the world
like unto the noses of all the men women and children whom Pantagruel
found dwelling upon the island of EnnasinBy the way if you
would know the strange way of getting akin amongst so flatnosed a
peopleyou must read the bookfind it out yourself you never can

Twas shaped Sir like an ace of clubs

Tis a full inch continued my grandfather pressing up the ridge of
his nose with his finger and thumb and repeating his assertiontis a
full inch longer madam than my fathersYou must mean your uncles
replied my greatgrandmother

My greatgrandfather was convincedHe untwisted the paper and
signed the article



Chapter 2XXVI

What an unconscionable jointure my dear do we pay out of this small
estate of ours quoth my grandmother to my grandfather

My father replied my grandfather had no more nose my dear saving the
mark than there is upon the back of my hand

Now you must know that my greatgrandmother outlived my grandfather
twelve years so that my father had the jointure to pay a hundred and
fifty pounds halfyearlyon Michaelmas and Ladydayduring all that
time

No man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than my
fatherAnd as far as a hundred pounds went he would fling it upon the
table guinea by guinea with that spirited jerk of an honest welcome
which generous souls and generous souls only are able to fling down
money but as soon as ever he enterd upon the odd fiftyhe generally
gave a loud Hem rubbd the side of his nose leisurely with the flat
part of his fore fingerinserted his hand cautiously betwixt his head
and the cawl of his wiglookd at both sides of every guinea as he
parted with itand seldom could get to the end of the fifty pounds
without pulling out his handkerchief and wiping his temples

Defend me gracious Heaven from those persecuting spirits who make no
allowances for these workings within usNeverO never may I lay down
in their tents who cannot relax the engine and feel pity for the
force of education and the prevalence of opinions long derived from
ancestors

For three generations at least this tenet in favour of long noses had
gradually been taking root in our familyTradition was all along on
its side and Interest was every halfyear stepping in to strengthen it
so that the whimsicality of my fathers brain was far from having
the whole honour of this as it had of almost all his other strange
notionsFor in a great measure he might be said to have suckd this in
with his mothers milk He did his part howeverIf education planted
the mistake in case it was one my father watered it and ripened it to
perfection

He would often declare in speaking his thoughts upon the subject that
he did not conceive how the greatest family in England could stand
it out against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short
nosesAnd for the contrary reason he would generally add That it
must be one of the greatest problems in civil life where the same
number of long and jolly noses following one another in a direct
line did not raise and hoist it up into the best vacancies in the
kingdomHe would often boast that the Shandy family rankd very
high in king Harry the VIIIths time but owed its rise to no state
enginehe would saybut to that onlybut that like other families
he would addit had felt the turn of the wheel and had never recovered
the blow of my greatgrandfathers noseIt was an ace of clubs indeed
he would cry shaking his headand as vile a one for an unfortunate
family as ever turnd up trumps

Fair and softly gentle readerwhere is thy fancy carrying theeIf
there is truth in man by my greatgrandfathers nose I mean the
external organ of smelling or that part of man which stands
prominent in his faceand which painters say in good jolly noses
and wellproportioned faces should comprehend a full thirdthat is
measured downwards from the setting on of the hair

What a life of it has an author at this pass



Chapter 2XXVII

It is a singular blessing that nature has formd the mind of man with
the same happy backwardness and renitency against conviction which is
observed in old dogsof not learning new tricks

What a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher that ever
existed be whiskd into at once did he read such books and observe
such facts and think such thoughts as would eternally be making him
change sides

Now my father as I told you last year detested all thisHe pickd
up an opinion Sir as a man in a state of nature picks up an appleIt
becomes his ownand if he is a man of spirit he would lose his life
rather than give it up

I am aware that Didius the great civilian will contest this point
and cry out against me Whence comes this mans right to this apple ex
confesso he will saythings were in a state of natureThe apple is
as much Franks apple as Johns Pray Mr Shandy what patent has he
to shew for it and how did it begin to be his was it when he set his
heart upon it or when he gathered it or when he chewd it or when he
roasted it or when he peeld or when he brought it home or when he
digestedor when heFor tis plain Sir if the first picking up
of the apple made it not histhat no subsequent act could

Brother Didius Tribonius will answernow Tribonius the civilian and
church lawyers beard being three inches and a half and three eighths
longer than Didius his beardIm glad he takes up the cudgels for me
so I give myself no farther trouble about the answerBrother Didius
Tribonius will say it is a decreed case as you may find it in the
fragments of Gregorius and Hermoginess codes and in all the codes from
Justinians down to the codes of Louis and Des EauxThat the sweat of a
mans brows and the exsudations of a mans brains are as much a mans
own property as the breeches upon his backsidewhich said exsudations
c being droppd upon the said apple by the labour of finding it
and picking it up and being moreover indissolubly wasted and as
indissolubly annexd by the picker up to the thing pickd up carried
home roasted peeld eaten digested and so ontis evident that
the gatherer of the apple in so doing has mixd up something which
was his own with the apple which was not his own by which means he has
acquired a propertyor in other words the apple is Johns apple

By the same learned chain of reasoning my father stood up for all his
opinions he had spared no pains in picking them up and the more they
lay out of the common way the better still was his titleNo mortal
claimed them they had cost him moreover as much labour in cooking and
digesting as in the case above so that they might well and truly be
said to be of his own goods and chattelsAccordingly he held fast by
em both by teeth and clawswould fly to whatever he could lay his
hands onand in a word would intrench and fortify them round with
as many circumvallations and breastworks as my uncle Toby would a
citadel

There was one plaguy rub in the way of thisthe scarcity of materials
to make any thing of a defence with in case of a smart attack inasmuch
as few men of great genius had exercised their parts in writing books
upon the subject of great noses by the trotting of my lean horse the
thing is incredible and I am quite lost in my understanding when I am
considering what a treasure of precious time and talents together has
been wasted upon worse subjectsand how many millions of books in all
languages and in all possible types and bindings have been fabricated
upon points not half so much tending to the unity and peacemaking of
the world What was to be had however he set the greater store by
and though my father would ofttimes sport with my uncle Tobys
librarywhich bythebye was ridiculous enoughyet at the very same
time he did it he collected every book and treatise which had been
systematically wrote upon noses with as much care as my honest uncle
Toby had done those upon military architectureTis true a much less
table would have held thembut that was not thy transgression my dear
uncle

Herebut why hererather than in any other part of my storyI am not
able to tellbut here it ismy heart stops me to pay to thee my dear
uncle Toby once for all the tribute I owe thy goodnessHere let
me thrust my chair aside and kneel down upon the ground whilst I am
pouring forth the warmest sentiment of love for thee and veneration for
the excellency of thy character that ever virtue and nature kindled
in a nephews bosomPeace and comfort rest for evermore upon
thy headThou enviedst no mans comfortsinsultedst no mans
opinionsThou blackenedst no mans characterdevouredst no mans
bread gently with faithful Trim behind thee didst thou amble
round the little circle of thy pleasures jostling no creature in thy
wayfor each ones sorrows thou hadst a tearfor each mans need
thou hadst a shilling

Whilst I am worth one to pay a weederthy path from thy door to thy
bowlinggreen shall never be grown upWhilst there is a rood and a
half of land in the Shandy family thy fortifications my dear uncle
Toby shall never be demolishd



Chapter 2XXVIII

My fathers collection was not great but to make amends it was
curious and consequently he was some time in making it he had the
great good fortune hewever to set off well in getting Bruscambilles
prologue upon long noses almost for nothingfor he gave no more for
Bruscambille than three halfcrowns owing indeed to the strong fancy
which the stallman saw my father had for the book the moment he
laid his hands upon itThere are not three Bruscambilles in
Christendomsaid the stallman except what are chaind up in the
libraries of the curious My father flung down the money as quick as
lightningtook Bruscambille into his bosomhied home from Piccadilly
to Colemanstreet with it as he would have hied home with a treasure
without taking his hand once off from Bruscambille all the way

To those who do not yet know of which gender Bruscambille isinasmuch
as a prologue upon long noses might easily be done by eithertwill be
no objection against the simileto say That when my father got home
he solaced himself with Bruscambille after the manner in which tis ten
to one your worship solaced yourself with your first mistressthat is
from morning even unto night which bythebye how delightful soever
it may prove to the inamoratois of little or no entertainment at
all to bystandersTake notice I go no farther with the similemy
fathers eye was greater than his appetitehis zeal greater than his
knowledgehe cooldhis affections became dividedhe got hold
of Prignitzpurchased Scroderus Andrea Paraeus Bouchets Evening
Conferences and above all the great and learned Hafen Slawkenbergius
of which as I shall have much to say byandbyeI will say nothing
now



Chapter 2XXIX

Of all the tracts my father was at the pains to procure and study in
support of his hypothesis there was not any one wherein he felt a more
cruel disappointment at first than in the celebrated dialogue between
Pamphagus and Cocles written by the chaste pen of the great and
venerable Erasmus upon the various uses and seasonable applications of
long nosesNow dont let Satan my dear girl in this chapter take
advantage of any one spot of rising ground to get astride of your
imagination if you can any ways help it or if he is so nimble as to
slip onlet me beg of you like an unbackd filly to frisk it to
squirt it to jump it to rear it to bound itand to kick it with
long kicks and short kicks till like Tickletobys mare you break a
strap or a crupper and throw his worship into the dirtYou need not
kill him

And pray who was Tickletobys maretis just as discreditable and
unscholarlike a question Sir as to have asked what year ab urb
con the second Punic war broke outWho was Tickletobys mareRead
read read read my unlearned reader reador by the knowledge of the
great saint ParaleipomenonI tell you beforehand you had better throw
down the book at once for without much reading by which your reverence
knows I mean much knowledge you will no more be able to penetrate the
moral of the next marbled page motley emblem of my work than the
world with all its sagacity has been able to unravel the many opinions
transactions and truths which still lie mystically hid under the dark
veil of the black one



two marble plates



Chapter 2XXX

Nihil me paenitet hujus nasi quoth Pamphagusthat isMy nose has
been the making of meNec est cur poeniteat replies Cocles that
is How the duce should such a nose fail

The doctrine you see was laid down by Erasmus as my father wished
it with the utmost plainness but my fathers disappointment was
in finding nothing more from so able a pen but the bare fact
itself without any of that speculative subtilty or ambidexterity of
argumentation upon it which Heaven had bestowd upon man on purpose to
investigate truth and fight for her on all sidesMy father pishd and
pughd at first most terriblytis worth something to have a good name
As the dialogue was of Erasmus my father soon came to himself and read
it over and over again with great application studying every word and
every syllable of it thro and thro in its most strict and literal
interpretationhe could still make nothing of it that way Mayhap
there is more meant than is said in it quoth my fatherLearned men
brother Toby dont write dialogues upon long noses for nothingIll
study the mystick and the allegorick sensehere is some room to turn a
mans self in brother

My father read on

Now I find it needful to inform your reverences and worships that
besides the many nautical uses of long noses enumerated by Erasmus
the dialogist affirmeth that a long nose is not without its domestic
conveniences also for that in a case of distressand for want of a
pair of bellows it will do excellently well ad ixcitandum focum to
stir up the fire

Nature had been prodigal in her gifts to my father beyond measure and
had sown the seeds of verbal criticism as deep within him as she
had done the seeds of all other knowledgeso that he had got out his
penknife and was trying experiments upon the sentence to see if he
could not scratch some better sense into itIve got within a
single letter brother Toby cried my father of Erasmus his mystic
meaningYou are near enough brother replied my uncle in all
consciencePshaw cried my father scratching onI might as well
be seven miles offIve done itsaid my father snapping his
fingersSee my dear brother Toby how I have mended the senseBut
you have marrd a word replied my uncle TobyMy father put on his
spectaclesbit his lipand tore out the leaf in a passion



Chapter 2XXXI

O Slawkenbergius thou faithful analyzer of my Disgraziasthou sad
foreteller of so many of the whips and short turns which on one stage or
other of my life have come slap upon me from the shortness of my nose
and no other cause that I am conscious ofTell me Slawkenbergius
what secret impulse was it what intonation of voice whence came it
how did it sound in thy earsart thou sure thou heardst itwhich
first cried out to theegogo Slawkenbergius dedicate the labours of
thy lifeneglect thy pastimescall forth all the powers and faculties
of thy naturemacerate thyself in the service of mankind and write a
grand Folio for them upon the subject of their noses

How the communication was conveyed into Slawkenbergiuss sensoriumso
that Slawkenbergius should know whose finger touchd the keyand whose
hand it was that blew the bellowsas Hafen Slawkenbergius has been dead
and laid in his grave above fourscore and ten yearswe can only raise
conjectures

Slawkenbergius was playd upon for aught I know like one of
Whitefields disciplesthat is with such a distinct intelligence Sir
of which of the two masters it was that had been practising upon his
instrumentas to make all reasoning upon it needless

For in the account which Hafen Slawkenbergius gives the world of his
motives and occasions for writing and spending so many years of his
life upon this one worktowards the end of his prolegomena which
bythebye should have come firstbut the bookbinder has most
injudiciously placed it betwixt the analytical contents of the book and
the book itselfhe informs his reader that ever since he had arrived
at the age of discernment and was able to sit down cooly and consider
within himself the true state and condition of man and distinguish the
main end and design of his beingorto shorten my translation for
Slawkenbergiuss book is in Latin and not a little prolix in this
passageever since I understood quoth Slawkenbergius any thingor
rather what was whatand could perceive that the point of long noses
had been too loosely handled by all who had gone beforehave I
Slawkenbergius felt a strong impulse with a mighty and unresistible
call within me to gird up myself to this undertaking

And to do justice to Slawkenbergius he has entered the list with a
stronger lance and taken a much larger career in it than any one
man who had ever entered it before himand indeed in many respects
deserves to be ennichd as a prototype for all writers of voluminous
works at least to model their books byfor he has taken in Sir the
whole subjectexamined every part of it dialecticallythen brought
it into full day dilucidating it with all the light which either the
collision of his own natural parts could strikeor the profoundest
knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon itcollating
collecting and compilingbegging borrowing and stealing as he went
along all that had been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and
porticos of the learned so that Slawkenbergius his book may properly be
considered not only as a modelbut as a thoroughstitched Digest and
regular institute of noses comprehending in it all that is or can be
needful to be known about them

For this cause it is that I forbear to speak of so many otherwise
valuable books and treatises of my fathers collecting wrote either
plump upon nosesor collaterally touching themsuch for instance
as Prignitz now lying upon the table before me who with infinite
learning and from the most candid and scholarlike examination of above
four thousand different skulls in upwards of twenty charnelhouses in
Silesia which he had rummagedhas informed us that the mensuration
and configuration of the osseous or bony parts of human noses in any
given tract of country except Crim Tartary where they are all crushd
down by the thumb so that no judgment can be formed upon themare
much nearer alike than the world imaginesthe difference amongst them
being he says a mere trifle not worth taking notice ofbut that the
size and jollity of every individual nose and by which one nose ranks
above another and bears a higher price is owing to the cartilaginous
and muscular parts of it into whose ducts and sinuses the blood and
animal spirits being impelld and driven by the warmth and force of the
imagination which is but a step from it bating the case of idiots
whom Prignitz who had lived many years in Turky supposes under the
more immediate tutelage of Heavenit so happens and ever must says
Prignitz that the excellency of the nose is in a direct arithmetical
proportion to the excellency of the wearers fancy

It is for the same reason that is because tis all comprehended in
Slawkenbergius that I say nothing likewise of Scroderus Andrea
who all the world knows set himself to oppugn Prignitz with great
violenceproving it in his own way first logically and then by a
series of stubborn facts That so far was Prignitz from the truth in
affirming that the fancy begat the nose that on the contrarythe nose
begat the fancy

The learned suspected Scroderus of an indecent sophism in thisand
Prignitz cried out aloud in the dispute that Scroderus had shifted the
idea upon himbut Scroderus went on maintaining his thesis

My father was just balancing within himself which of the two sides he
should take in this affair when Ambrose Paraeus decided it in a moment
and by overthrowing the systems both of Prignitz and Scroderus drove
my father out of both sides of the controversy at once

Be witness

I dont acquaint the learned readerin saying it I mention it only to
shew the learned I know the fact myself

That this Ambrose Paraeus was chief surgeon and nosemender to Francis
the ninth of France and in high credit with him and the two preceding
or succeeding kings I know not whichand that except in the slip he
made in his story of Taliacotiuss noses and his manner of setting them
onhe was esteemed by the whole college of physicians at that time as
more knowing in matters of noses than any one who had ever taken them
in hand

Now Ambrose Paraeus convinced my father that the true and efficient
cause of what had engaged so much the attention of the world and
upon which Prignitz and Scroderus had wasted so much learning and fine
partswas neither this nor thatbut that the length and goodness of
the nose was owing simply to the softness and flaccidity in the nurses
breastas the flatness and shortness of puisne noses was to the
firmness and elastic repulsion of the same organ of nutrition in the
hale and livelywhich tho happy for the woman was the undoing of the
child inasmuch as his nose was so snubbd so rebuffd so rebated
and so refrigerated thereby as never to arrive ad mensuram suam
legitimambut that in case of the flaccidity and softness of the nurse
or mothers breastby sinking into it quoth Paraeus as into so
much butter the nose was comforted nourishd plumpd up refreshd
refocillated and set a growing for ever

I have but two things to observe of Paraeus first That he proves
and explains all this with the utmost chastity and decorum of
expressionfor which may his soul for ever rest in peace

And secondly that besides the systems of Prignitz and Scroderus which
Ambrose Paraeus his hypothesis effectually overthrewit overthrew at
the same time the system of peace and harmony of our family and for
three days together not only embroiled matters between my father and
my mother but turnd likewise the whole house and every thing in it
except my uncle Toby quite upside down

Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife
never surely in any age or country got vent through the keyhole of a
streetdoor

My mother you must knowbut I have fifty things more necessary to let
you know firstI have a hundred difficulties which I have promised to
clear up and a thousand distresses and domestick misadventures crowding
in upon me thick and threefold one upon the neck of another A cow
broke in tomorrow morning to my uncle Tobys fortifications and eat
up two rations and a half of dried grass tearing up the sods with it
which faced his hornwork and covered wayTrim insists upon
being tried by a courtmartialthe cow to be shotSlop to be
crucifixdmyself to be tristramd and at my very baptism made a martyr
ofpoor unhappy devils that we all areI want swaddlingbut there
is no time to be lost in exclamationsI have left my father lying
across his bed and my uncle Toby in his old fringed chair sitting
beside him and promised I would go back to them in half an hour and
fiveandthirty minutes are lapsd alreadyOf all the perplexities a
mortal author was ever seen inthis certainly is the greatest for I
have Hafen Slawkenbergiuss folio Sir to finisha dialogue between
my father and my uncle Toby upon the solution of Prignitz Scroderus
Ambrose Paraeus Panocrates and Grangousier to relatea tale out of
Slawkenbergius to translate and all this in five minutes less than
no time at allsuch a headwould to Heaven my enemies only saw the
inside of it



Chapter 2XXXII

There was not any one scene more entertaining in our familyand to do
it justice in this pointand I here put off my cap and lay it upon the
table close beside my inkhorn on purpose to make my declaration to the
world concerning this one article the more solemnthat I believe in my
soul unless my love and partiality to my understanding blinds me the
hand of the supreme Maker and first Designer of all things never made
or put a family together in that period at least of it which I have
sat down to write the story ofwhere the characters of it were cast or
contrasted with so dramatick a felicity as ours was for this end or in
which the capacities of affording such exquisite scenes and the powers
of shifting them perpetually from morning to night were lodged and
intrusted with so unlimited a confidence as in the Shandy Family

Not any one of these was more diverting I say in this whimsical
theatre of oursthan what frequently arose out of this selfsame
chapter of long nosesespecially when my fathers imagination was
heated with the enquiry and nothing would serve him but to heat my
uncle Tobys too

My uncle Toby would give my father all possible fair play in this
attempt and with infinite patience would sit smoking his pipe for
whole hours together whilst my father was practising upon his head
and trying every accessible avenue to drive Prignitz and Scroderuss
solutions into it

Whether they were above my uncle Tobys reasonor contrary to itor
that his brain was like damp timber and no spark could possibly take
holdor that it was so full of saps mines blinds curtins and such
military disqualifications to his seeing clearly into Prignitz and
Scroderuss doctrinesI say notlet schoolmenscullions anatomists
and engineers fight for it among themselves

Twas some misfortune I make no doubt in this affair that my father
had every word of it to translate for the benefit of my uncle Toby
and render out of Slawkenbergiuss Latin of which as he was no great
master his translation was not always of the purestand generally
least so where twas most wantedThis naturally opend a door to a
second misfortunethat in the warmer paroxysms of his zeal to open
my uncle Tobys eyesmy fathers ideas ran on as much faster than the
translation as the translation outmoved my uncle Tobysneither the
one or the other added much to the perspicuity of my fathers lecture



Chapter 2XXXIII

The gift of ratiocination and making syllogismsI mean in manfor in
superior classes of being such as angels and spiritstis all done
may it please your worships as they tell me by Intuitionand beings
inferior as your worships all knowsyllogize by their noses though
there is an island swimming in the sea though not altogether at its
ease whose inhabitants if my intelligence deceives me not are
so wonderfully gifted as to syllogize after the same fashion and
ofttimes to make very well out toobut thats neither here nor
there

The gift of doing it as it should be amongst us orthe great and
principal act of ratiocination in man as logicians tell us is the
finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another
by the intervention of a third called the medius terminus just as a
man as Locke well observes by a yard finds two mens ninepinalleys
to be of the same length which could not be brought together to
measure their equality by juxtaposition

Had the same great reasoner looked on as my father illustrated his
systems of noses and observed my uncle Tobys deportmentwhat great
attention he gave to every wordand as oft as he took his pipe from
his mouth with what wonderful seriousness he contemplated the length of
itsurveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his finger and
his thumbthen forerightthen this way and then that in all its
possible directions and foreshorteningshe would have concluded my
uncle Toby had got hold of the medius terminus and was syllogizing and
measuring with it the truth of each hypothesis of long noses in order
as my father laid them before him This bythebye was more than my
father wantedhis aim in all the pains he was at in these philosophick
lectureswas to enable my uncle Toby not to discussbut comprehendto
hold the grains and scruples of learningnot to weigh themMy uncle
Toby as you will read in the next chapter did neither the one or the
other



Chapter 2XXXIV

Tis a pity cried my father one winters night after a three hours
painful translation of Slawkenbergiustis a pity cried my father
putting my mothers threadpaper into the book for a mark as he
spokethat truth brother Toby should shut herself up in such
impregnable fastnesses and be so obstinate as not to surrender herself
sometimes up upon the closest siege

Now it happened then as indeed it had often done before that my uncle
Tobys fancy during the time of my fathers explanation of Prignitz to
himhaving nothing to stay it there had taken a short flight to the
bowlinggreenhis body might as well have taken a turn there tooso
that with all the semblance of a deep schoolman intent upon the medius
terminusmy uncle Toby was in fact as ignorant of the whole lecture
and all its pros and cons as if my father had been translating Hafen
Slawkenbergius from the Latin tongue into the Cherokee But the word
siege like a talismanic power in my fathers metaphor wafting back
my uncle Tobys fancy quick as a note could follow the touchhe opend
his earsand my father observing that he took his pipe out of his
mouth and shuffled his chair nearer the table as with a desire to
profitmy father with great pleasure began his sentence againchanging
only the plan and dropping the metaphor of the siege of it to keep
clear of some dangers my father apprehended from it

Tis a pity said my father that truth can only be on one side brother
Tobyconsidering what ingenuity these learned men have all shewn in
their solutions of nosesCan noses be dissolved replied my uncle
Toby

My father thrust back his chairrose upput on his hattook four
long strides to the doorjerked it openthrust his head half way
outshut the door againtook no notice of the bad hingereturned
to the tablepluckd my mothers threadpaper out of Slawkenbergiuss
bookwent hastily to his bureauwalked slowly backtwisted my
mothers threadpaper about his thumbunbuttond his waistcoatthrew
my mothers threadpaper into the firebit her sattin pincushion in
two filld his mouth with branconfounded itbut markthe oath of
confusion was levelld at my uncle Tobys brainwhich was een confused
enough alreadythe curse came charged only with the branthe bran may
it please your honours was no more than powder to the ball

Twas well my fathers passions lasted not long for so long as they
did last they led him a busy life ont and it is one of the most
unaccountable problems that ever I met with in my observations of human
nature that nothing should prove my fathers mettle so much or make
his passions go off so like gunpowder as the unexpected strokes
his science met with from the quaint simplicity of my uncle Tobys
questionsHad ten dozen of hornets stung him behind in so many
different places all at one timehe could not have exerted more
mechanical functions in fewer secondsor started half so much as with
one single quaere of three words unseasonably popping in full upon him
in his hobbyhorsical career

Twas all one to my uncle Tobyhe smoked his pipe on with unvaried
composurehis heart never intended offence to his brotherand as his
head could seldom find out where the sting of it layhe always gave
my father the credit of cooling by himselfHe was five minutes and
thirtyfive seconds about it in the present case

By all thats good said my father swearing as he came to himself and
taking the oath out of Ernulphuss digest of cursesthough to do my
father justice it was a fault as he told Dr Slop in the affair of
Ernulphus which he as seldom committed as any man upon earthBy all
thats good and great brother Toby said my father if it was not for
the aids of philosophy which befriend one so much as they doyou would
put a man beside all temperWhy by the solutions of noses of which
I was telling you I meant as you might have known had you favoured me
with one grain of attention the various accounts which learned men of
different kinds of knowledge have given the world of the causes of short
and long nosesThere is no cause but one replied my uncle Tobywhy
one mans nose is longer than anothers but because that God pleases to
have it soThat is Grangousiers solution said my fatherTis
he continued my uncle Toby looking up and not regarding my fathers
interruption who makes us all and frames and puts us together in
such forms and proportions and for such ends as is agreeable to
his infinite wisdomTis a pious account cried my father but not
philosophicalthere is more religion in it than sound science Twas no
inconsistent part of my uncle Tobys characterthat he feared God and
reverenced religionSo the moment my father finished his remarkmy
uncle Toby fell a whistling Lillabullero with more zeal though more out
of tune than usual

What is become of my wifes threadpaper



Chapter 2XXXV

No matteras an appendage to seamstressy the threadpaper might be
of some consequence to my motherof none to my father as a mark in
Slawkenbergius Slawkenbergius in every page of him was a rich treasure
of inexhaustible knowledge to my fatherhe could not open him amiss
and he would often say in closing the book that if all the arts and
sciences in the world with the books which treated of them were
lostshould the wisdom and policies of governments he would say
through disuse ever happen to be forgot and all that statesmen had
wrote or caused to be written upon the strong or the weak sides of
courts and kingdoms should they be forgot alsoand Slawkenbergius only
leftthere would be enough in him in all conscience he would say
to set the world agoing again A treasure therefore was he indeed
an institute of all that was necessary to be known of noses and every
thing elseat matin noon and vespers was Hafen Slawkenbergius his
recreation and delight twas for ever in his handsyou would have
sworn Sir it had been a canons prayerbookso worn so glazed so
contrited and attrited was it with fingers and with thumbs in all its
parts from one end even unto the other

I am not such a bigot to Slawkenbergius as my fatherthere is a fund
in him no doubt but in my opinion the best I dont say the most
profitable but the most amusing part of Hafen Slawkenbergius is his
talesand considering he was a German many of them told not without
fancythese take up his second book containing nearly one half of
his folio and are comprehended in ten decads each decad containing ten
talesPhilosophy is not built upon tales and therefore twas certainly
wrong in Slawkenbergius to send them into the world by that namethere
are a few of them in his eighth ninth and tenth decads which I own
seem rather playful and sportive than speculativebut in general they
are to be looked upon by the learned as a detail of so many independent
facts all of them turning round somehow or other upon the main hinges
of his subject and added to his work as so many illustrations upon the
doctrines of noses

As we have leisure enough upon our handsif you give me leave madam
Ill tell you the ninth tale of his tenth decad



Slawkenbergii Fabella As Hafen Slawkenbergius de Nasis is extremely
scarce it may not be unacceptable to the learned reader to see the
specimen of a few pages of his original I will make no reflection
upon it but that his storytelling Latin is much more concise than his
philosophicand I think has more of Latinity in it

Slawkenbergiuss Tale

It was one cool refreshing evening at the close of a very sultry day
in the latter end of the month of August when a stranger mounted upon
a dark mule with a small cloakbag behind him containing a few shirts
a pair of shoes and a crimsonsattin pair of breeches entered the town
of Strasburg

He told the centinel who questioned him as he entered the gates that
he had been at the Promontory of Noseswas going on to Frankfortand
should be back again at Strasburg that day month in his way to the
borders of Crim Tartary

The centinel looked up into the strangers facehe never saw such a
Nose in his life

I have made a very good venture of it quoth the strangerso slipping
his wrist out of the loop of a black ribbon to which a short scymetar
was hung he put his hand into his pocket and with great courtesy
touching the fore part of his cap with his left hand as he extended his
righthe put a florin into the centinels hand and passed on

It grieves me said the centinel speaking to a little dwarfish
bandyleggd drummer that so courteous a soul should have lost his
scabbardhe cannot travel without one to his scymetar and will not
be able to get a scabbard to fit it in all StrasburgI never had one
replied the stranger looking back to the centinel and putting his hand
up to his cap as he spokeI carry it continued he thusholding up
his naked scymetar his mule moving on slowly all the timeon purpose
to defend my nose

It is well worth it gentle stranger replied the centinel

Tis not worth a single stiver said the bandyleggd drummertis a
nose of parchment

As I am a true catholicexcept that it is six times as bigtis a
nose said the centinel like my own

I heard it crackle said the drummer

By dunder said the centinel I saw it bleed

What a pity cried the bandyleggd drummer we did not both touch it

At the very time that this dispute was maintaining by the centinel
and the drummerwas the same point debating betwixt a trumpeter and a
trumpeters wife who were just then coming up and had stopped to see
the stranger pass by

BenedicityWhat a nose tis as long said the trumpeters wife as a
trumpet

And of the same metal said the trumpeter as you hear by its sneezing

Tis as soft as a flute said she

Tis brass said the trumpeter

Tis a puddings end said his wife

I tell thee again said the trumpeter tis a brazen nose

Ill know the bottom of it said the trumpeters wife for I will touch
it with my finger before I sleep

The strangers mule moved on at so slow a rate that he heard every
word of the dispute not only betwixt the centinel and the drummer but
betwixt the trumpeter and trumpeters wife

No said he dropping his reins upon his mules neck and laying both
his hands upon his breast the one over the other in a saintlike
position his mule going on easily all the time No said he looking
upI am not such a debtor to the worldslandered and disappointed as
I have beenas to give it that convictionno said he my nose shall
never be touched whilst Heaven gives me strengthTo do what said a
burgomasters wife

The stranger took no notice of the burgomasters wifehe was making
a vow to Saint Nicolas which done having uncrossed his arms with the
same solemnity with which he crossed them he took up the reins of his
bridle with his lefthand and putting his right hand into his bosom
with the scymetar hanging loosely to the wrist of it he rode on as
slowly as one foot of the mule could follow another thro the principal
streets of Strasburg till chance brought him to the great inn in the
marketplace overagainst the church

The moment the stranger alighted he ordered his mule to be led into the
stable and his cloakbag to be brought in then opening and taking out
of it his crimsonsattin breeches with a silverfringedappendage to
them which I dare not translatehe put his breeches with his fringed
codpiece on and forthwith with his short scymetar in his hand
walked out to the grand parade

The stranger had just taken three turns upon the parade when he
perceived the trumpeters wife at the opposite side of itso turning
short in pain lest his nose should be attempted he instantly went back
to his innundressed himself packed up his crimsonsattin breeches
c in his cloakbag and called for his mule

I am going forwards said the stranger for Frankfortand shall be back
at Strasburg this day month

I hope continued the stranger stroking down the face of his mule with
his left hand as he was going to mount it that you have been kind
to this faithful slave of mineit has carried me and my cloakbag
continued he tapping the mules back above six hundred leagues

Tis a long journey Sir replied the master of the innunless a man
has great businessTut tut said the stranger I have been at the
promontory of Noses and have got me one of the goodliest thank Heaven
that ever fell to a single mans lot

Whilst the stranger was giving this odd account of himself the master
of the inn and his wife kept both their eyes fixed full upon the
strangers noseBy saint Radagunda said the innkeepers wife to
herself there is more of it than in any dozen of the largest noses put
together in all Strasburg is it not said she whispering her husband
in his ear is it not a noble nose

Tis an imposture my dear said the master of the inntis a false
nose

Tis a true nose said his wife

Tis made of firtree said he I smell the turpentine

Theres a pimple on it said she

Tis a dead nose replied the innkeeper

Tis a live nose and if I am alive myself said the innkeepers wife
I will touch it

I have made a vow to saint Nicolas this day said the stranger that my
nose shall not be touched tillHere the stranger suspending his voice
looked upTill when said she hastily

It never shall be touched said he clasping his hands and bringing them
close to his breast till that hourWhat hour cried the inn keepers
wifeNevernever said the stranger never till I am gotFor
Heavens sake into what place said sheThe stranger rode away without
saying a word

The stranger had not got half a league on his way towards Frankfort
before all the city of Strasburg was in an uproar about his nose The
Compline bells were just ringing to call the Strasburgers to their
devotions and shut up the duties of the day in prayerno soul in all
Strasburg heard emthe city was like a swarm of beesmen women and
children the Compline bells tinkling all the time flying here and
therein at one door out at anotherthis way and that waylong ways
and cross waysup one street down another streetin at this alley
out of thatdid you see it did you see it did you see it O did you
see itwho saw it who did see it for mercys sake who saw it

Alack oday I was at vespersI was washing I was starching I was
scouring I was quiltingGod help me I never saw itI never touchd
itwould I had been a centinel a bandyleggd drummer a trumpeter
a trumpeters wife was the general cry and lamentation in every street
and corner of Strasburg

Whilst all this confusion and disorder triumphed throughout the great
city of Strasburg was the courteous stranger going on as gently upon
his mule in his way to Frankfort as if he had no concern at all in the
affairtalking all the way he rode in broken sentences sometimes to
his mulesometimes to himselfsometimes to his Julia

O Julia my lovely Julianay I cannot stop to let thee bite that
thistlethat ever the suspected tongue of a rival should have robbed me
of enjoyment when I was upon the point of tasting it

Pughtis nothing but a thistlenever mind itthou shalt have a
better supper at night

Banishd from my countrymy friendsfrom thee

Poor devil thourt sadly tired with thy journeycomeget on a little
fastertheres nothing in my cloakbag but two shirtsa crimsonsattin
pair of breeches and a fringedDear Julia

But why to Frankfortis it that there is a hand unfelt which
secretly is conducting me through these meanders and unsuspected tracts

Stumbling by saint Nicolas every stepwhy at this rate we shall be
all night in getting in

To happinessor am I to be the sport of fortune and slanderdestined
to be driven forth unconvictedunhearduntouchdif so why did I
not stay at Strasburg where justicebut I had sworn Come thou
shalt drinkto St NicolasO JuliaWhat dost thou prick up thy ears
attis nothing but a man c

The stranger rode on communing in this manner with his mule and
Juliatill he arrived at his inn where as soon as he arrived he
alightedsaw his mule as he had promised it taken good care oftook
off his cloakbag with his crimsonsattin breeches c in itcalled
for an omelet to his supper went to his bed about twelve oclock and
in five minutes fell fast asleep

It was about the same hour when the tumult in Strasburg being abated for
that nightthe Strasburgers had all got quietly into their bedsbut
not like the stranger for the rest either of their minds or bodies
queen Mab like an elf as she was had taken the strangers nose and
without reduction of its bulk had that night been at the pains of
slitting and dividing it into as many noses of different cuts and
fashions as there were heads in Strasburg to hold them The abbess of
Quedlingberg who with the four great dignitaries of her chapter the
prioress the deaness the subchantress and senior canonness had
that week come to Strasburg to consult the university upon a case of
conscience relating to their placketholeswas ill all the night

The courteous strangers nose had got perched upon the top of the pineal
gland of her brain and made such rousing work in the fancies of the
four great dignitaries of her chapter they could not get a wink of
sleep the whole night thro for itthere was no keeping a limb still
amongst themin short they got up like so many ghosts

The penitentiaries of the third order of saint Francisthe nuns
of mount Calvarythe Praemonstratensesthe Clunienses Hafen
Slawkenbergius means the Benedictine nuns of Cluny founded in the
year 940 by Odo abbe de Clunythe Carthusians and all the severer
orders of nuns who lay that night in blankets or haircloth were still
in a worse condition than the abbess of Quedlingbergby tumbling and
tossing and tossing and tumbling from one side of their beds to the
other the whole night longthe several sisterhoods had scratchd and
mauld themselves all to deaththey got out of their beds almost flayd
aliveevery body thought saint Antony had visited them for probation
with his firethey had never once in short shut their eyes the whole
night long from vespers to matins

The nuns of saint Ursula acted the wisestthey never attempted to go to
bed at all

The dean of Strasburg the prebendaries the capitulars and domiciliars
capitularly assembled in the morning to consider the case of butterd
buns all wished they had followed the nuns of saint Ursulas example

In the hurry and confusion every thing had been in the night before the
bakers had all forgot to lay their leaventhere were no butterd
buns to be had for breakfast in all Strasburgthe whole close of the
cathedral was in one eternal commotionsuch a cause of restlessness
and disquietude and such a zealous inquiry into that cause of the
restlessness had never happened in Strasburg since Martin Luther with
his doctrines had turned the city upside down

If the strangers nose took this liberty of thrusting himself thus into
the dishes Mr Shandys compliments to oratorsis very sensible that
Slawkenbergius has here changed his metaphorwhich he is very guilty
ofthat as a translator Mr Shandy has all along done what he could
to make him stick to itbut that here twas impossible of religious
orders c what a carnival did his nose make of it in those of the
laitytis more than my pen worn to the stump as it is has power to
describe tho I acknowledge cries Slawkenbergius with more gaiety of
thought than I could have expected from him that there is many a good
simile now subsisting in the world which might give my countrymen some
idea of it but at the close of such a folio as this wrote for their
sakes and in which I have spent the greatest part of my lifetho I
own to them the simile is in being yet would it not be unreasonable in
them to expect I should have either time or inclination to search for
it Let it suffice to say that the riot and disorder it occasioned
in the Strasburgers fantasies was so generalsuch an overpowering
mastership had it got of all the faculties of the Strasburgers mindsso
many strange things with equal confidence on all sides and with equal
eloquence in all places were spoken and sworn to concerning it that
turned the whole stream of all discourse and wonder towards itevery
soul good and badrich and poorlearned and unlearneddoctor and
studentmistress and maidgentle and simplenuns flesh and womans
flesh in Strasburg spent their time in hearing tidings about itevery
eye in Strasburg languished to see itevery fingerevery thumb in
Strasburg burned to touch it

Now what might add if any thing may be thought necessary to add to
so vehement a desirewas this that the centinel the bandyleggd
drummer the trumpeter the trumpeters wife the burgomasters widow
the master of the inn and the master of the inns wife how widely
soever they all differed every one from another in their testimonies
and description of the strangers nosethey all agreed together in two
pointsnamely that he was gone to Frankfort and would not return to
Strasburg till that day month and secondly whether his nose was true
or false that the stranger himself was one of the most perfect paragons
of beautythe finestmade manthe most genteelthe most generous of
his pursethe most courteous in his carriage that had ever entered the
gates of Strasburgthat as he rode with scymetar slung loosely to his
wrist thro the streetsand walked with his crimsonsattin breeches
across the paradetwas with so sweet an air of careless modesty and
so manly withalas would have put the heart in jeopardy had his nose
not stood in his way of every virgin who had cast her eyes upon him

I call not upon that heart which is a stranger to the throbs
and yearnings of curiosity so excited to justify the abbess of
Quedlingberg the prioress the deaness and subchantress for sending
at noonday for the trumpeters wife she went through the streets of
Strasburg with her husbands trumpet in her handthe best apparatus
the straitness of the time would allow her for the illustration of her
theoryshe staid no longer than three days

The centinel and bandyleggd drummernothing on this side of old
Athens could equal them they read their lectures under the citygates
to comers and goers with all the pomp of a Chrysippus and a Crantor in
their porticos

The master of the inn with his ostler on his lefthand read his also
in the same stileunder the portico or gateway of his stableyardhis
wife hers more privately in a back room all flocked to their lectures
not promiscuouslybut to this or that as is ever the way as faith and
credulity marshald themin a word each Strasburger came crouding for
intelligenceand every Strasburger had the intelligence he wanted

Tis worth remarking for the benefit of all demonstrators in natural
philosophy c that as soon as the trumpeters wife had finished the
abbess of Quedlingbergs private lecture and had begun to read
in public which she did upon a stool in the middle of the great
paradeshe incommoded the other demonstrators mainly by gaining
incontinently the most fashionable part of the city of Strasburg for her
auditoryBut when a demonstrator in philosophy cries Slawkenbergius
has a trumpet for an apparatus pray what rival in science can pretend
to be heard besides him

Whilst the unlearned thro these conduits of intelligence were all
busied in getting down to the bottom of the well where Truth keeps her
little courtwere the learned in their way as busy in pumping her up
thro the conduits of dialect inductionthey concerned themselves not
with factsthey reasoned

Not one profession had thrown more light upon this subject than the
Facultyhad not all their disputes about it run into the affair of Wens
and oedematous swellings they could not keep clear of them for their
bloods and soulsthe strangers nose had nothing to do either with wens
or oedematous swellings

It was demonstrated however very satisfactorily that such a ponderous
mass of heterogenous matter could not be congested and conglomerated
to the nose whilst the infant was in Utera without destroying the
statical balance of the foetus and throwing it plump upon its head nine
months before the time

The opponents granted the theorythey denied the consequences

And if a suitable provision of veins arteries c said they was
not laid in for the due nourishment of such a nose in the very first
stamina and rudiments of its formation before it came into the world
bating the case of Wens it could not regularly grow and be sustained
afterwards

This was all answered by a dissertation upon nutriment and the effect
which nutriment had in extending the vessels and in the increase and
prolongation of the muscular parts to the greatest growth and expansion
imaginableIn the triumph of which theory they went so far as to
affirm that there was no cause in nature why a nose might not grow to
the size of the man himself

The respondents satisfied the world this event could never happen to
them so long as a man had but one stomach and one pair of lungsFor the
stomach said they being the only organ destined for the reception
of food and turning it into chyleand the lungs the only engine
of sanguificationit could possibly work off no more than what the
appetite brought it or admitting the possibility of a mans overloading
his stomach nature had set bounds however to his lungsthe engine was
of a determined size and strength and could elaborate but a certain
quantity in a given timethat is it could produce just as much blood
as was sufficient for one single man and no more so that if there was
as much nose as manthey proved a mortification must necessarily ensue
and forasmuch as there could not be a support for both that the nose
must either fall off from the man or the man inevitably fall off from
his nose

Nature accommodates herself to these emergencies cried the
opponentselse what do you say to the case of a whole stomacha
whole pair of lungs and but half a man when both his legs have been
unfortunately shot off

He dies of a plethora said theyor must spit blood and in a fortnight
or three weeks go off in a consumption

It happens otherwisereplied the opponents

It ought not said they

The more curious and intimate inquirers after nature and her doings
though they went hand in hand a good way together yet they all divided
about the nose at last almost as much as the Faculty itself

They amicably laid it down that there was a just and geometrical
arrangement and proportion of the several parts of the human frame to
its several destinations offices and functions which could not
be transgressed but within certain limitsthat nature though she
sportedshe sported within a certain circleand they could not agree
about the diameter of it

The logicians stuck much closer to the point before them than any of the
classes of the literatithey began and ended with the word Nose and
had it not been for a petitio principii which one of the ablest of
them ran his head against in the beginning of the combat the whole
controversy had been settled at once

A nose argued the logician cannot bleed without bloodand not only
bloodbut blood circulating in it to supply the phaenomenon with a
succession of dropsa stream being but a quicker succession of drops
that is included said heNow death continued the logician being
nothing but the stagnation of the blood

I deny the definitionDeath is the separation of the soul from the
body said his antagonistThen we dont agree about our weapons
said the logicianThen there is an end of the dispute replied the
antagonist

The civilians were still more concise what they offered being more in
the nature of a decreethan a dispute

Such a monstrous nose said they had it been a true nose could not
possibly have been suffered in civil societyand if falseto impose
upon society with such false signs and tokens was a still greater
violation of its rights and must have had still less mercy shewn it

The only objection to this was that if it proved any thing it proved
the strangers nose was neither true nor false

This left room for the controversy to go on It was maintained by the
advocates of the ecclesiastic court that there was nothing to inhibit a
decree since the stranger ex mero motu had confessed he had been at the
Promontory of Noses and had got one of the goodliest c cTo this
it was answered it was impossible there should be such a place as
the Promontory of Noses and the learned be ignorant where it lay The
commissary of the bishop of Strasburg undertook the advocates explained
this matter in a treatise upon proverbial phrases shewing them that
the Promontory of Noses was a mere allegorick expression importing no
more than that nature had given him a long nose in proof of which
with great learning he cited the underwritten authorities Nonnulli

3 Vid Idea which had decided the point incontestably had it not
appeared that a dispute about some franchises of dean and chapterlands
had been determined by it nineteen years before

It happenedI must say unluckily for Truth because they were giving
her a lift another way in so doing that the two universities of
Strasburgthe Lutheran founded in the year 1538 by Jacobus Surmis
counsellor of the senateand the Popish founded by Leopold archduke
of Austria were during all this time employing the whole depth
of their knowledge except just what the affair of the abbess of
Quedlingbergs placketholes requiredin determining the point of
Martin Luthers damnation

The Popish doctors had undertaken to demonstrate a priori that from the
necessary influence of the planets on the twentysecond day of October
1483when the moon was in the twelfth house Jupiter Mars and Venus
in the third the Sun Saturn and Mercury all got together in the
fourththat he must in course and unavoidably be a damnd manand
that his doctrines by a direct corollary must be damnd doctrines too

By inspection into his horoscope where five planets were in coition all
at once with Scorpio Haec mira satisque horrenda Planetarum coitio
sub Scorpio Asterismo in nona coeli statione quam Arabes religioni
deputabant efficit Martinum Lutherum sacrilegum hereticum Christianae
religionis hostem acerrimum atque prophanum ex horoscopi directione

infernos navigavitab Alecto Tisiphone  Megara flagellis igneis
cruciata perenniterLucas Gaurieus in Tractatu astrologico de
praeteritis multorum hominum accidentibus per genituras examinatis in
reading this my father would always shake his head in the ninth house
with the Arabians allotted to religionit appeared that Martin Luther
did not care one stiver about the matterand that from the horoscope
directed to the conjunction of Marsthey made it plain likewise he must
die cursing and blasphemingwith the blast of which his soul being
steepd in guilt sailed before the wind in the lake of hellfire

The little objection of the Lutheran doctors to this was that it must
certainly be the soul of another man born Oct 22 83 which was forced
to sail down before the wind in that mannerinasmuch as it appeared
from the register of Islaben in the county of Mansfelt that Luther was
not born in the year 1483 but in 84 and not on the 22d day of October
but on the 10th of November the eve of Martinmas day from whence he
had the name of Martin

I must break off my translation for a moment for if I did not I
know I should no more be able to shut my eyes in bed than the abbess of
QuedlingbergIt is to tell the reader that my father never read this
passage of Slawkenbergius to my uncle Toby but with triumphnot over
my uncle Toby for he never opposed him in itbut over the whole world

Now you see brother Toby he would say looking up that christian
names are not such indifferent thingshad Luther here been called
by any other name but Martin he would have been damnd to all
eternityNot that I look upon Martin he would add as a good namefar
from ittis something better than a neutral and but a littleyet
little as it is you see it was of some service to him

My father knew the weakness of this prop to his hypothesis as well as
the best logician could shew himyet so strange is the weakness of man
at the same time as it fell in his way he could not for his life but
make use of it and it was certainly for this reason that though there
are many stories in Hafen Slawkenbergiuss Decades full as entertaining
as this I am translating yet there is not one amongst them which
my father read over with half the delightit flattered two of his
strangest hypotheses togetherhis Names and his NosesI will be bold
to say he might have read all the books in the Alexandrian Library
had not fate taken other care of them and not have met with a book or
passage in one which hit two such nails as these upon the head at one
stroke

The two universities of Strasburg were hard tugging at this affair of
Luthers navigation The Protestant doctors had demonstrated that
he had not sailed right before the wind as the Popish doctors had
pretended and as every one knew there was no sailing full in the teeth
of itthey were going to settle in case he had sailed how many points
he was off whether Martin had doubled the cape or had fallen upon a
leeshore and no doubt as it was an enquiry of much edification at
least to those who understood this sort of Navigation they had gone on
with it in spite of the size of the strangers nose had not the size of
the strangers nose drawn off the attention of the world from what they
were aboutit was their business to follow

The abbess of Quedlingberg and her four dignitaries was no stop for the
enormity of the strangers nose running full as much in their fancies
as their case of consciencethe affair of their placketholes
kept coldin a word the printers were ordered to distribute their
typesall controversies droppd

Twas a square cap with a silver tassel upon the crown of itto
a nutshellto have guessed on which side of the nose the two
universities would split

Tis above reason cried the doctors on one side

Tis below reason cried the others

Tis faith cried one

Tis a fiddlestick said the other

Tis possible cried the one

Tis impossible said the other

Gods power is infinite cried the Nosarians he can do any thing

He can do nothing replied the Antinosarians which implies
contradictions

He can make matter think said the Nosarians

As certainly as you can make a velvet cap out of a sows ear replied
the Antinosarians

He cannot make two and two five replied the Popish doctorsTis
false said their other opponents

Infinite power is infinite power said the doctors who maintained the
reality of the noseIt extends only to all possible things replied
the Lutherans

By God in heaven cried the Popish doctors he can make a nose if he
thinks fit as big as the steeple of Strasburg

Now the steeple of Strasburg being the biggest and the tallest
churchsteeple to be seen in the whole world the Antinosarians denied
that a nose of 575 geometrical feet in length could be worn at least
by a middlesizd manThe Popish doctors swore it couldThe Lutheran
doctors said Noit could not

This at once started a new dispute which they pursued a great way
upon the extent and limitation of the moral and natural attributes of
GodThat controversy led them naturally into Thomas Aquinas and Thomas
Aquinas to the devil

The strangers nose was no more heard of in the disputeit just served
as a frigate to launch them into the gulph of schooldivinityand then
they all sailed before the wind

Heat is in proportion to the want of true knowledge

The controversy about the attributes c instead of cooling on the
contrary had inflamed the Strasburgers imaginations to a most inordinate
degreeThe less they understood of the matter the greater was their
wonder about itthey were left in all the distresses of desire
unsatisfiedsaw their doctors the Parchmentarians the Brassarians
the Turpentarians on one sidethe Popish doctors on the other like
Pantagruel and his companions in quest of the oracle of the bottle all
embarked out of sight

The poor Strasburgers left upon the beach

What was to be doneNo delaythe uproar increasedevery one in
disorderthe city gates set open

Unfortunate Strasbergers was there in the storehouse of naturewas
there in the lumberrooms of learningwas there in the great arsenal
of chance one single engine left undrawn forth to torture your
curiosities and stretch your desires which was not pointed by the
hand of Fate to play upon your heartsI dip not my pen into my ink to
excuse the surrender of yourselvestis to write your panegyrick Shew
me a city so macerated with expectationwho neither eat or drank
or slept or prayed or hearkened to the calls either of religion or
nature for sevenandtwenty days together who could have held out one
day longer

On the twentyeighth the courteous stranger had promised to return to
Strasburg

Seven thousand coaches Slawkenbergius must certainly have made some
mistake in his numeral characters 7000 coaches15000 singlehorse
chairs20000 waggons crowded as full as they could all hold with
senators counsellors syndicksbeguines widows wives virgins
canons concubines all in their coachesThe abbess of Quedlingberg
with the prioress the deaness and subchantress leading the procession
in one coach and the dean of Strasburg with the four great dignitaries
of his chapter on her lefthandthe rest following higgletypigglety
as they could some on horsebacksome on footsome ledsome
drivensome down the Rhinesome this waysome thatall set out at
sunrise to meet the courteous stranger on the road

Haste we now towards the catastrophe of my taleI say Catastrophe
cries Slawkenbergius inasmuch as a tale with parts rightly disposed
not only rejoiceth gaudet in the Catastrophe and Peripeitia of a
Drama but rejoiceth moreover in all the essential and integrant parts
of itit has its Protasis Epitasis Catastasis its Catastrophe or
Peripeitia growing one out of the other in it in the order Aristotle
first planted themwithout which a tale had better never be told at
all says Slawkenbergius but be kept to a mans self

In all my ten tales in all my ten decades have I Slawkenbergius tied
down every tale of them as tightly to this rule as I have done this of
the stranger and his nose

From his first parley with the centinel to his leaving the city of
Strasburg after pulling off his crimsonsattin pair of breeches is
the Protasis or first entrancewhere the characters of the Personae
Dramatis are just touched in and the subject slightly begun

The Epitasis wherein the action is more fully entered upon and
heightened till it arrives at its state or height called the
Catastasis and which usually takes up the 2d and 3d act is included
within that busy period of my tale betwixt the first nights uproar
about the nose to the conclusion of the trumpeters wifes lectures
upon it in the middle of the grand parade and from the first embarking
of the learned in the disputeto the doctors finally sailing away and
leaving the Strasburgers upon the beach in distress is the Catastasis
or the ripening of the incidents and passions for their bursting forth
in the fifth act

This commences with the setting out of the Strasburgers in the Frankfort
road and terminates in unwinding the labyrinth and bringing the hero
out of a state of agitation as Aristotle calls it to a state of rest
and quietness

This says Hafen Slawkenbergius constitutes the Catastrophe or
Peripeitia of my taleand that is the part of it I am going to relate

We left the stranger behind the curtain asleephe enters now upon the
stage

What dost thou prick up thy ears attis nothing but a man upon a
horsewas the last word the stranger uttered to his mule It was not
proper then to tell the reader that the mule took his masters word for
it and without any more ifs or ands let the traveller and his horse
pass by

The traveller was hastening with all diligence to get to Strasburg that
night What a fool am I said the traveller to himself when he had
rode about a league farther to think of getting into Strasburg this
nightStrasburgthe great StrasburgStrasburg the capital of
all Alsatia Strasburg an imperial city Strasburg a sovereign state
Strasburg garrisoned with five thousand of the best troops in all the
worldAlas if I was at the gates of Strasburg this moment I could
not gain admittance into it for a ducatnay a ducat and halftis too
muchbetter go back to the last inn I have passedthan lie I know
not whereor give I know not what The traveller as he made these
reflections in his mind turned his horses head about and three
minutes after the stranger had been conducted into his chamber he
arrived at the same inn

We have bacon in the house said the host and breadand till eleven
oclock this night had three eggs in itbut a stranger who arrived an
hour ago has had them dressed into an omelet and we have nothing

Alas said the traveller harassed as I am I want nothing but a bedI
have one as soft as is in Alsatia said the host

The stranger continued he should have slept in it for tis my best
bed but upon the score of his noseHe has got a defluxion said the
travellerNot that I know cried the hostBut tis a campbed and
Jacinta said he looking towards the maid imagined there was not
room in it to turn his nose inWhy so cried the traveller starting
backIt is so long a nose replied the hostThe traveller fixed
his eyes upon Jacinta then upon the groundkneeled upon his right
kneehad just got his hand laid upon his breastTrifle not with my
anxiety said he rising up againTis no trifle said Jacinta tis
the most glorious noseThe traveller fell upon his knee againlaid
his hand upon his breastthen said he looking up to heaven thou hast
conducted me to the end of my pilgrimageTis Diego

The traveller was the brother of the Julia so often invoked that night
by the stranger as he rode from Strasburg upon his mule and was
come on her part in quest of him He had accompanied his sister from
Valadolid across the Pyrenean mountains through France and had many an
entangled skein to wind off in pursuit of him through the many meanders
and abrupt turnings of a lovers thorny tracks

Julia had sunk under itand had not been able to go a step farther
than to Lyons where with the many disquietudes of a tender heart
which all talk ofbut few feelshe sickend but had just strength to
write a letter to Diego and having conjured her brother never to see
her face till he had found him out and put the letter into his hands
Julia took to her bed

Fernandez for that was her brothers nametho the campbed was as
soft as any one in Alsace yet he could not shut his eyes in itAs
soon as it was day he rose and hearing Diego was risen too he entered
his chamber and discharged his sisters commission

The letter was as follows

Seig Diego

Whether my suspicions of your nose were justly excited or nottis
not now to inquireit is enough I have not had firmness to put them to
farther tryal

How could I know so little of myself when I sent my Duenna to forbid
your coming more under my lattice or how could I know so little of you
Diego as to imagine you would not have staid one day in Valadolid to
have given ease to my doubtsWas I to be abandoned Diego because
I was deceived or was it kind to take me at my word whether my
suspicions were just or no and leave me as you did a prey to much
uncertainty and sorrow

In what manner Julia has resented thismy brother when he puts this
letter into your hands will tell you He will tell you in how few
moments she repented of the rash message she had sent youin what
frantic haste she flew to her lattice and how many days and nights
together she leaned immoveably upon her elbow looking through it
towards the way which Diego was wont to come

He will tell you when she heard of your departurehow her spirits
deserted herhow her heart sickendhow piteously she mournedhow low
she hung her head O Diego how many weary steps has my brothers pity
led me by the hand languishing to trace out yours how far has desire
carried me beyond strengthand how oft have I fainted by the way and
sunk into his arms with only power to cry outO my Diego

If the gentleness of your carriage has not belied your heart you will
fly to me almost as fast as you fled from mehaste as you willyou
will arrive but to see me expireTis a bitter draught Diego but oh
tis embittered still more by dying un

She could proceed no farther

Slawkenbergius supposes the word intended was unconvinced but her
strength would not enable her to finish her letter

The heart of the courteous Diego overflowed as he read the letterhe
ordered his mule forthwith and Fernandezs horse to be saddled and as
no vent in prose is equal to that of poetry in such conflictschance
which as often directs us to remedies as to diseases having thrown
a piece of charcoal into the windowDiego availed himself of it and
whilst the hostler was getting ready his mule he eased his mind against
the wall as follows


Ode

 Harsh and untuneful are the notes of love
 Unless my Julia strikes the key
 Her hand alone can touch the part
 Whose dulcet movement charms the heart
 And governs all the man with sympathetick sway

2d


O Julia

The lines were very naturalfor they were nothing at all to the
purpose says Slawkenbergius and tis a pity there were no more
of them but whether it was that Seig Diego was slow in composing
versesor the hostler quick in saddling mulesis not averred certain
it was that Diegos mule and Fernandezs horse were ready at the door
of the inn before Diego was ready for his second stanza so without
staying to finish his ode they both mounted sallied forth passed the
Rhine traversed Alsace shaped their course towards Lyons and before
the Strasburgers and the abbess of Quedlingberg had set out on their
cavalcade had Fernandez Diego and his Julia crossed the Pyrenean
mountains and got safe to Valadolid

Tis needless to inform the geographical reader that when Diego was
in Spain it was not possible to meet the courteous stranger in the
Frankfort road it is enough to say that of all restless desires
curiosity being the strongestthe Strasburgers felt the full force of
it and that for three days and nights they were tossed to and fro in
the Frankfort road with the tempestuous fury of this passion before
they could submit to return homeWhen alas an event was prepared for
them of all other the most grievous that could befal a free people

As this revolution of the Strasburgers affairs is often spoken of and
little understood I will in ten words says Slawkenbergius give the
world an explanation of it and with it put an end to my tale

Every body knows of the grand system of Universal Monarchy wrote by
order of Mons Colbert and put in manuscript into the hands of Lewis
the fourteenth in the year 1664

Tis as well known that one branch out of many of that system was the
getting possession of Strasburg to favour an entrance at all times
into Suabia in order to disturb the quiet of Germanyand that in
consequence of this plan Strasburg unhappily fell at length into their
hands

It is the lot of a few to trace out the true springs of this and such
like revolutionsThe vulgar look too high for themStatesmen look too
lowTruth for once lies in the middle

What a fatal thing is the popular pride of a free city cries one
historianThe Strasburgers deemed it a diminution of their freedom to
receive an imperial garrisonso fell a prey to a French one

The fate says another of the Strasburgers may be a warning to
all free people to save their moneyThey anticipated their
revenuesbrought themselves under taxes exhausted their strength and
in the end became so weak a people they had not strength to keep their
gates shut and so the French pushed them open

Alas alas cries Slawkenbergius twas not the Frenchtwas Curiosity
pushed them openThe French indeed who are ever upon the catch when
they saw the Strasburgers men women and children all marched out to
follow the strangers noseeach man followed his own and marched in

Trade and manufactures have decayed and gradually grown down ever
sincebut not from any cause which commercial heads have assigned for
it is owing to this only that Noses have ever so run in their heads
that the Strasburgers could not follow their business

Alas alas cries Slawkenbergius making an exclamationit is not the
firstand I fear will not be the last fortress that has been either
wonor lost by Noses

The End of Slawkenbergiuss Tale



Chapter 2XXXVI

With all this learning upon Noses running perpetually in my fathers
fancywith so many family prejudicesand ten decades of such tales
running on for ever along with themhow was it possible with such
exquisitewas it a true noseThat a man with such exquisite feelings
as my father had could bear the shock at all below stairsor indeed
above stairs in any other posture but the very posture I have
described

Throw yourself down upon the bed a dozen timestaking care only to
place a lookingglass first in a chair on one side of it before you do
itBut was the strangers nose a true nose or was it a false one

To tell that beforehand madam would be to do injury to one of the
best tales in the Christianworld and that is the tenth of the tenth
decade which immediately follows this

This tale cried Slawkenbergius somewhat exultingly has been reserved
by me for the concluding tale of my whole work knowing right well
that when I shall have told it and my reader shall have read it
throtwould be even high time for both of us to shut up the book
inasmuch continues Slawkenbergius as I know of no tale which could
possibly ever go down after it

Tis a tale indeed

This sets out with the first interview in the inn at Lyons when
Fernandez left the courteous stranger and his sister Julia alone in her
chamber and is overwritten


The Intricacies of Diego and Julia

Heavens thou art a strange creature Slawkenbergius what a whimsical
view of the involutions of the heart of woman hast thou opened how this
can ever be translated and yet if this specimen of Slawkenbergiuss
tales and the exquisitiveness of his moral should please the
worldtranslated shall a couple of volumes beElse how this can ever
be translated into good English I have no sort of conceptionThere
seems in some passages to want a sixth sense to do it rightlyWhat can
he mean by the lambent pupilability of slow low dry chat five notes
below the natural tonewhich you know madam is little more than a
whisper The moment I pronounced the words I could perceive an attempt
towards a vibration in the strings about the region of the heartThe
brain made no acknowledgmentTheres often no good understanding
betwixt emI felt as if I understood itI had no ideasThe
movement could not be without causeIm lost I can make nothing of
itunless may it please your worships the voice in that case being
little more than a whisper unavoidably forces the eyes to approach not
only within six inches of each otherbut to look into the pupilsis
not that dangerousBut it cant be avoidedfor to look up to the
cieling in that case the two chins unavoidably meetand to look down
into each others lap the foreheads come to immediate contact which
at once puts an end to the conferenceI mean to the sentimental part of
itWhat is left madam is not worth stooping for



Chapter 2XXXVII

My father lay stretched across the bed as still as if the hand of death
had pushed him down for a full hour and a half before he began to play
upon the floor with the toe of that foot which hung over the bedside
my uncle Tobys heart was a pound lighter for itIn a few moments
his lefthand the knuckles of which had all the time reclined upon the
handle of the chamberpot came to its feelinghe thrust it a little
more within the valancedrew up his hand when he had done into his
bosomgave a hem My good uncle Toby with infinite pleasure answered
it and full gladly would have ingrafted a sentence of consolation upon
the opening it afforded but having no talents as I said that way and
fearing moreover that he might set out with something which might make
a bad matter worse he contented himself with resting his chin placidly
upon the cross of his crutch

Now whether the compression shortened my uncle Tobys face into a more
pleasurable ovalor that the philanthropy of his heart in seeing
his brother beginning to emerge out of the sea of his afflictions
had braced up his musclesso that the compression upon his chin only
doubled the benignity which was there before is not hard to decideMy
father in turning his eyes was struck with such a gleam of sunshine
in his face as melted down the sullenness of his grief in a moment

He broke silence as follows



Chapter 2XXXVIII

Did ever man brother Toby cried my father raising himself upon his
elbow and turning himself round to the opposite side of the bed
where my uncle Toby was sitting in his old fringed chair with his chin
resting upon his crutchdid ever a poor unfortunate man brother Toby
cried my father receive so many lashesThe most I ever saw given
quoth my uncle Toby ringing the bell at the beds head for Trim was to
a grenadier I think in Mackays regiment

Had my uncle Toby shot a bullet through my fathers heart he could
not have fallen down with his nose upon the quilt more suddenly

Bless me said my uncle Toby



Chapter 2XXXIX

Was it Mackays regiment quoth my uncle Toby where the poor grenadier
was so unmercifully whippd at Bruges about the ducatsO Christ he
was innocent cried Trim with a deep sighAnd he was whippd may it
please your honour almost to deaths doorThey had better have shot
him outright as he beggd and he had gone directly to heaven for
he was as innocent as your honourI thank thee Trim quoth my uncle
TobyI never think of his continued Trim and my poor brother Toms
misfortunes for we were all three schoolfellows but I cry like a
cowardTears are no proof of cowardice TrimI drop them ofttimes
myself cried my uncle TobyI know your honour does replied Trim
and so am not ashamed of it myselfBut to think may it please your
honour continued Trim a tear stealing into the corner of his eye as
he spoketo think of two virtuous lads with hearts as warm in their
bodies and as honest as God could make themthe children of honest
people going forth with gallant spirits to seek their fortunes in the
worldand fall into such evilspoor Tom to be tortured upon a rack
for nothingbut marrying a Jews widow who sold sausageshonest Dick
Johnsons soul to be scourged out of his body for the ducats
another man put into his knapsackOthese are misfortunes cried
Trimpulling out his handkerchiefthese are misfortunes may it
please your honour worth lying down and crying over

My father could not help blushing

Twould be a pity Trim quoth my uncle Toby thou shouldst ever feel
sorrow of thy ownthou feelest it so tenderly for othersAlackoday
replied the corporal brightening up his faceyour honour knows I have
neither wife or childI can have no sorrows in this worldMy father
could not help smilingAs few as any man Trim replied my uncle Toby
nor can I see how a fellow of thy light heart can suffer but from the
distress of poverty in thy old agewhen thou art passed all services
Trimand hast outlived thy friendsAn please your honour never
fear replied Trim chearilyBut I would have thee never fear Trim
replied my uncle Toby and therefore continued my uncle Toby throwing
down his crutch and getting up upon his legs as he uttered the word
thereforein recompence Trim of thy long fidelity to me and that
goodness of thy heart I have had such proofs ofwhilst thy master is
worth a shillingthou shalt never ask elsewhere Trim for a penny
Trim attempted to thank my uncle Tobybut had not powertears trickled
down his cheeks faster than he could wipe them offHe laid his hands
upon his breastmade a bow to the ground and shut the door

I have left Trim my bowlinggreen cried my uncle TobyMy father
smiledI have left him moreover a pension continued my uncle
TobyMy father looked grave



Chapter 2XL

Is this a fit time said my father to himself to talk of Pensions and
Grenadiers



Chapter 2XLI

When my uncle Toby first mentioned the grenadier my father I said
fell down with his nose flat to the quilt and as suddenly as if my
uncle Toby had shot him but it was not added that every other limb
and member of my father instantly relapsed with his nose into the same
precise attitude in which he lay first described so that when corporal
Trim left the room and my father found himself disposed to rise off
the bedhe had all the little preparatory movements to run over again
before he could do it Attitudes are nothing madamtis the transition
from one attitude to anotherlike the preparation and resolution of the
discord into harmony which is all in all

For which reason my father played the same jig over again with his toe
upon the floorpushed the chamberpot still a little farther within
the valancegave a hemraised himself up upon his elbowand was just
beginning to address himself to my uncle Tobywhen recollecting the
unsuccessfulness of his first effort in that attitudehe got upon his
legs and in making the third turn across the room he stopped short
before my uncle Toby and laying the three first fingers of his
righthand in the palm of his left and stooping a little he addressed
himself to my uncle Toby as follows



Chapter 2XLII

When I reflect brother Toby upon Man and take a view of that dark
side of him which represents his life as open to so many causes of
troublewhen I consider brother Toby how oft we eat the bread
of affliction and that we are born to it as to the portion of our
inheritanceI was born to nothing quoth my uncle Toby interrupting my
fatherbut my commission Zooks said my father did not my uncle leave
you a hundred and twenty pounds a yearWhat could I have done without
it replied my uncle TobyThats another concern said my father
testilyBut I say Toby when one runs over the catalogue of all the
crossreckonings and sorrowful Items with which the heart of man is
overcharged tis wonderful by what hidden resources the mind is enabled
to stand out and bear itself up as it does against the impositions
laid upon our natureTis by the assistance of Almighty God cried
my uncle Toby looking up and pressing the palms of his hands close
togethertis not from our own strength brother Shandya centinel
in a wooden centrybox might as well pretend to stand it out against a
detachment of fifty menWe are upheld by the grace and the assistance
of the best of Beings

That is cutting the knot said my father instead of untying itBut
give me leave to lead you brother Toby a little deeper into the
mystery

With all my heart replied my uncle Toby

My father instantly exchanged the attitude he was in for that in which
Socrates is so finely painted by Raffael in his school of Athens which
your connoisseurship knows is so exquisitely imagined that even the
particular manner of the reasoning of Socrates is expressed by itfor
he holds the forefinger of his lefthand between the forefinger and
the thumb of his right and seems as if he was saying to the libertine
he is reclaimingYou grant me thisand this and this and this I
dont ask of youthey follow of themselves in course

So stood my father holding fast his forefinger betwixt his finger and
his thumb and reasoning with my uncle Toby as he sat in his old
fringed chair valanced around with partycoloured worsted bobsO
Garrickwhat a rich scene of this would thy exquisite powers make
and how gladly would I write such another to avail myself of thy
immortality and secure my own behind it



Chapter 2XLIII

Though man is of all others the most curious vehicle said my father
yet at the same time tis of so slight a frame and so totteringly put
together that the sudden jerks and hard jostlings it unavoidably meets
with in this rugged journey would overset and tear it to pieces a dozen
times a daywas it not brother Toby that there is a secret
spring within usWhich spring said my uncle Toby I take to be
ReligionWill that set my childs nose on cried my father letting
go his finger and striking one hand against the otherIt makes every
thing straight for us answered my uncle TobyFiguratively speaking
dear Toby it may for aught I know said my father but the spring I
am speaking of is that great and elastic power within us of
counterbalancing evil which like a secret spring in a wellordered
machine though it cant prevent the shockat least it imposes upon our
sense of it

Now my dear brother said my father replacing his forefinger as
he was coming closer to the pointhad my child arrived safe into the
world unmartyrd in that precious part of himfanciful and extravagant
as I may appear to the world in my opinion of christian names and of
that magic bias which good or bad names irresistibly impress upon
our characters and conductsHeaven is witness that in the warmest
transports of my wishes for the prosperity of my child I never once
wished to crown his head with more glory and honour than what George or
Edward would have spread around it

But alas continued my father as the greatest evil has befallen himI
must counteract and undo it with the greatest good

He shall be christened Trismegistus brother

I wish it may answerreplied my uncle Toby rising up



Chapter 2XLIV

What a chapter of chances said my father turning himself about upon
the first landing as he and my uncle Toby were going down stairs what
a long chapter of chances do the events of this world lay open to us
Take pen and ink in hand brother Toby and calculate it fairlyI know
no more of calculation than this balluster said my uncle Toby striking
short of it with his crutch and hitting my father a desperate blow
souse upon his shinboneTwas a hundred to onecried my uncle TobyI
thought quoth my father rubbing his shin you had known nothing of
calculations brother Toby A mere chance said my uncle TobyThen it
adds one to the chapterreplied my father

The double success of my fathers repartees tickled off the pain of his
shin at onceit was well it so fell outchance againor the world
to this day had never known the subject of my fathers calculationto
guess itthere was no chanceWhat a lucky chapter of chances has this
turned out for it has saved me the trouble of writing one express and
in truth I have enough already upon my hands without itHave not I
promised the world a chapter of knots two chapters upon the right
and the wrong end of a woman a chapter upon whiskers a chapter upon
wishesa chapter of nosesNo I have done thata chapter upon my
uncle Tobys modesty to say nothing of a chapter upon chapters which I
will finish before I sleepby my great grandfathers whiskers I shall
never get half of em through this year

Take pen and ink in hand and calculate it fairly brother Toby said my
father and it will turn out a million to one that of all the parts of
the body the edge of the forceps should have the ill luck just to fall
upon and break down that one part which should break down the fortunes
of our house with it

It might have been worse replied my uncle TobyI dont comprehend
said my fatherSuppose the hip had presented replied my uncle Toby
as Dr Slop foreboded

My father reflected half a minutelooked downtouched the middle of
his forehead slightly with his finger

True said he



Chapter 2XLV

Is it not a shame to make two chapters of what passed in going down one
pair of stairs for we are got no farther yet than to the first landing
and there are fifteen more steps down to the bottom and for aught I
know as my father and my uncle Toby are in a talking humour there may
be as many chapters as stepslet that be as it will Sir I can no
more help it than my destinyA sudden impulse comes across medrop
the curtain ShandyI drop itStrike a line here across the paper
TristramI strike itand hey for a new chapter

The deuce of any other rule have I to govern myself by in this
affairand if I had oneas I do all things out of all ruleI would
twist it and tear it to pieces and throw it into the fire when I had
doneAm I warm I am and the cause demands ita pretty story is a
man to follow rulesor rules to follow him

Now this you must know being my chapter upon chapters which I
promised to write before I went to sleep I thought it meet to ease my
conscience entirely before I laid down by telling the world all I knew
about the matter at once Is not this ten times better than to set out
dogmatically with a sententious parade of wisdom and telling the world
a story of a roasted horsethat chapters relieve the mindthat they
assistor impose upon the imaginationand that in a work of this
dramatic cast they are as necessary as the shifting of sceneswith
fifty other cold conceits enough to extinguish the fire which roasted
himO but to understand this which is a puff at the fire of Dianas
templeyou must read Longinusread awayif you are not a jot
the wiser by reading him the first time overnever fearread him
againAvicenna and Licetus read Aristotles metaphysicks forty times
through apiece and never understood a single wordBut mark the
consequenceAvicenna turned out a desperate writer at all kinds of

grew to that astonishing height in literature as to write a book with
a title as long as himselfthe learned know I mean his

So much for my chapter upon chapters which I hold to be the best
chapter in my whole work and take my word whoever reads it is full as
well employed as in picking straws



Chapter 2XLVI

We shall bring all things to rights said my father setting his foot
upon the first step from the landingThis Trismegistus continued
my father drawing his leg back and turning to my uncle Tobywas the
greatest Toby of all earthly beingshe was the greatest kingthe
greatest lawgiverthe greatest philosopherand the greatest
priestand engineersaid my uncle Toby

In course said my father



Chapter 2XLVII

And how does your mistress cried my father taking the same step over
again from the landing and calling to Susannah whom he saw passing
by the foot of the stairs with a huge pincushion in her handhow does
your mistress As well said Susannah tripping by but without looking
up as can be expectedWhat a fool am I said my father drawing his
leg back againlet things be as they will brother Toby tis ever the
precise answerAnd how is the child prayNo answer And where is
Dr Slop added my father raising his voice aloud and looking over the
ballustersSusannah was out of hearing

Of all the riddles of a married life said my father crossing the
landing in order to set his back against the wall whilst he propounded
it to my uncle Tobyof all the puzzling riddles said he in a marriage
stateof which you may trust me brother Toby there are more asses
loads than all Jobs stock of asses could have carriedthere is not one
that has more intricacies in it than thisthat from the very moment
the mistress of the house is brought to bed every female in it from my
ladys gentlewoman down to the cinderwench becomes an inch taller for
it and give themselves more airs upon that single inch than all their
other inches put together

I think rather replied my uncle Toby that tis we who sink an inch
lowerIf I meet but a woman with childI do itTis a heavy tax
upon that half of our fellowcreatures brother Shandy said my
uncle TobyTis a piteous burden upon em continued he shaking his
headYes yes tis a painful thingsaid my father shaking his head
toobut certainly since shaking of heads came into fashion never did
two heads shake together in concert from two such different springs

God bless  Deuce take em allsaid my uncle Toby and my father each
to himself



Chapter 2XVLIII

Hollayou chairmanheres sixpencedo step into that booksellers
shop and call me a daytall critick I am very willing to give any one
of em a crown to help me with his tackling to get my father and my
uncle Toby off the stairs and to put them to bed

Tis even high time for except a short nap which they both got
whilst Trim was boring the jackbootsand which bythebye did my
father no sort of good upon the score of the bad hingethey have not
else shut their eyes since nine hours before the time that doctor Slop
was led into the back parlour in that dirty pickle by Obadiah

Was every day of my life to be as busy a day as thisand to take
upTruce

I will not finish that sentence till I have made an observation upon the
strange state of affairs between the reader and myself just as things
stand at presentan observation never applicable before to any one
biographical writer since the creation of the world but to myselfand
I believe will never hold good to any other until its final
destructionand therefore for the very novelty of it alone it must be
worth your worships attending to

I am this month one whole year older than I was this time twelvemonth
and having got as you perceive almost into the middle of my third
volume According to the preceding Editionsand no farther than to
my first days lifetis demonstrative that I have three hundred and
sixtyfour days more life to write just now than when I first set out
so that instead of advancing as a common writer in my work with what I
have been doing at iton the contrary I am just thrown so many volumes
backwas every day of my life to be as busy a day as thisAnd why
notand the transactions and opinions of it to take up as much
descriptionAnd for what reason should they be cut short as at this
rate I should just live 364 times faster than I should writeIt must
follow an please your worships that the more I write the more I
shall have to writeand consequently the more your worships read the
more your worships will have to read

Will this be good for your worships eyes

It will do well for mine and was it not that my Opinions will be
the death of me I perceive I shall lead a fine life of it out of this
selfsame life of mine or in other words shall lead a couple of fine
lives together

As for the proposal of twelve volumes a year or a volume a month it
no way alters my prospectwrite as I will and rush as I may into
the middle of things as Horace advisesI shall never overtake myself
whippd and driven to the last pinch at the worst I shall have one
day the start of my penand one day is enough for two volumesand two
volumes will be enough for one year

Heaven prosper the manufacturers of paper under this propitious reign
which is now opened to usas I trust its providence will prosper every
thing else in it that is taken in hand

As for the propagation of GeeseI give myself no concernNature is
allbountifulI shall never want tools to work with

So then friend you have got my father and my uncle Toby off the
stairs and seen them to bedAnd how did you manage itYou droppd a
curtain at the stairfootI thought you had no other way for itHeres
a crown for your trouble



Chapter 2XLIX

Then reach me my breeches off the chair said my father to
SusannahThere is not a moments time to dress you Sir cried
Susannahthe child is as black in the face as myAs your what said
my father for like all orators he was a dear searcher into
comparisonsBless me Sir said Susannah the childs in a fitAnd
wheres Mr YorickNever where he should be said Susannah but his
curates in the dressingroom with the child upon his arm waiting
for the nameand my mistress bid me run as fast as I could to know as
captain Shandy is the godfather whether it should not be called after
him

Were one sure said my father to himself scratching his eyebrow that
the child was expiring one might as well compliment my brother Toby as
notand it would be a pity in such a case to throw away so great a
name as Trismegistus upon himbut he may recover

No nosaid my father to Susannah Ill get upThere is no time
cried Susannah the childs as black as my shoe Trismegistus said my
fatherBut staythou art a leaky vessel Susannah added my father
canst thou carry Trismegistus in thy head the length of the gallery
without scatteringCan I cried Susannah shutting the door in a
huffIf she can Ill be shot said my father bouncing out of bed in
the dark and groping for his breeches

Susannah ran with all speed along the gallery

My father made all possible speed to find his breeches

Susannah got the start and kept itTis Trissomething cried
SusannahThere is no christianname in the world said the curate
beginning with Trisbut Tristram Then tis Tristramgistus quoth
Susannah

There is no gistus to it noodletis my own name replied the
curate dipping his hand as he spoke into the basonTristram said
he c c c cso Tristram was I called and Tristram shall I be
to the day of my death

My father followed Susannah with his nightgown across his arm with
nothing more than his breeches on fastened through haste with but a
single button and that button through haste thrust only half into the
buttonhole

She has not forgot the name cried my father half opening the
doorNo no said the curate with a tone of intelligenceAnd the
child is better cried SusannahAnd how does your mistress As well
said Susannah as can be expectedPish said my father the button
of his breeches slipping out of the buttonholeSo that whether the
interjection was levelled at Susannah or the buttonholewhether Pish
was an interjection of contempt or an interjection of modesty is a
doubt and must be a doubt till I shall have time to write the three
following favourite chapters that is my chapter of chambermaids my
chapter of pishes and my chapter of buttonholes

All the light I am able to give the reader at present is this that
the moment my father cried Pish he whiskd himself aboutand with his
breeches held up by one hand and his nightgown thrown across the arm
of the other he turned along the gallery to bed something slower than
he came



Chapter 2L

I wish I could write a chapter upon sleep

A fitter occasion could never have presented itself than what this
moment offers when all the curtains of the family are drawnthe
candles put outand no creatures eyes are open but a single one for
the other has been shut these twenty years of my mothers nurse

It is a fine subject

And yet as fine as it is I would undertake to write a dozen chapters
upon buttonholes both quicker and with more fame than a single
chapter upon this

Buttonholes there is something lively in the very idea of emand
trust me when I get amongst emYou gentry with great beardslook as
grave as you willIll make merry work with my buttonholesI shall
have em all to myselftis a maiden subjectI shall run foul of no
mans wisdom or fine sayings in it

But for sleepI know I shall make nothing of it before I beginI am no
dab at your fine sayings in the first placeand in the next I cannot
for my soul set a grave face upon a bad matter and tell the worldtis
the refuge of the unfortunatethe enfranchisement of the prisonerthe
downy lap of the hopeless the weary and the brokenhearted nor could
I set out with a lye in my mouth by affirming that of all the soft and
delicious functions of our nature by which the great Author of it in
his bounty has been pleased to recompence the sufferings wherewith his
justice and his good pleasure has wearied usthat this is the chiefest
I know pleasures worth ten of it or what a happiness it is to man
when the anxieties and passions of the day are over and he lies
down upon his back that his soul shall be so seated within him that
whichever way she turns her eyes the heavens shall look calm and sweet
above herno desireor fearor doubt that troubles the air nor any
difficulty past present or to come that the imagination may not pass
over without offence in that sweet secession

Gods blessing said Sancho Panca be upon the man who first invented
this selfsame thing called sleepit covers a man all over like a
cloak Now there is more to me in this and it speaks warmer to my
heart and affections than all the dissertations squeezd out of the
heads of the learned together upon the subject

Not that I altogether disapprove of what Montaigne advances upon
ittis admirable in its wayI quote by memory

The world enjoys other pleasures says he as they do that of sleep
without tasting or feeling it as it slips and passes byWe should
study and ruminate upon it in order to render proper thanks to him
who grants it to usFor this end I cause myself to be disturbed in my
sleep that I may the better and more sensibly relish itAnd yet I
see few says he again who live with less sleep when need requires my
body is capable of a firm but not of a violent and sudden agitationI
evade of late all violent exercisesI am never weary with walkingbut
from my youth I never looked to ride upon pavements I love to lie
hard and alone and even without my wifeThis last word may stagger the
faith of the worldbut remember La Vraisemblance as Bayle says in
the affair of Liceti nest pas toujours du Cote de la Verite And so
much for sleep



Chapter 2LI

If my wife will but venture himbrother Toby Trismegistus shall
be dressd and brought down to us whilst you and I are getting our
breakfasts together

Go tell Susannah Obadiah to step here

She is run up stairs answered Obadiah this very instant sobbing and
crying and wringing her hands as if her heart would break

We shall have a rare month of it said my father turning his head from
Obadiah and looking wistfully in my uncle Tobys face for some timewe
shall have a devilish month of it brother Toby said my father
setting his arms akimbo and shaking his head fire water women
windbrother TobyTis some misfortune quoth my uncle TobyThat
it is cried my fatherto have so many jarring elements breaking loose
and riding triumph in every corner of a gentlemans houseLittle
boots it to the peace of a family brother Toby that you and I possess
ourselves and sit here silent and unmovedwhilst such a storm is
whistling over our heads

And whats the matter Susannah They have called the child
Tristramand my mistress is just got out of an hysterick fit
about itNotis not my fault said SusannahI told him it was
Tristramgistus

Make tea for yourself brother Toby said my father taking down his
hatbut how different from the sallies and agitations of voice and
members which a common reader would imagine

For he spake in the sweetest modulationand took down his hat with
the genteelest movement of limbs that ever affliction harmonized and
attuned together

Go to the bowlinggreen for corporal Trim said my uncle Toby
speaking to Obadiah as soon as my father left the room



Chapter 2LII

When the misfortune of my Nose fell so heavily upon my fathers
headthe reader remembers that he walked instantly up stairs and cast
himself down upon his bed and from hence unless he has a great insight
into human nature he will be apt to expect a rotation of the same
ascending and descending movements from him upon this misfortune of my
Nameno

The different weight dear Sirnay even the different package of two
vexations of the same weightmakes a very wide difference in our manner
of bearing and getting through with themIt is not half an hour ago
when in the great hurry and precipitation of a poor devils writing
for daily bread I threw a fair sheet which I had just finished and
carefully wrote out slap into the fire instead of the foul one

Instantly I snatchd off my wig and threw it perpendicularly with all
imaginable violence up to the top of the roomindeed I caught it as it
fellbut there was an end of the matter nor do I think any think else
in Nature would have given such immediate ease She dear Goddess by an
instantaneous impulse in all provoking cases determines us to a sally
of this or that memberor else she thrusts us into this or that place
or posture of body we know not whyBut mark madam we live amongst
riddles and mysteriesthe most obvious things which come in our way
have dark sides which the quickest sight cannot penetrate into and
even the clearest and most exalted understandings amongst us find
ourselves puzzled and at a loss in almost every cranny of natures
works so that this like a thousand other things falls out for us in
a way which tho we cannot reason upon ityet we find the good of it
may it please your reverences and your worshipsand thats enough for
us

Now my father could not lie down with this affliction for his lifenor
could he carry it up stairs like the otherhe walked composedly out
with it to the fishpond

Had my father leaned his head upon his hand and reasoned an hour which
way to have gonereason with all her force could not have directed
him to any think like it there is something Sir in fishpondsbut
what it is I leave to systembuilders and fishponddiggers betwixt
em to find outbut there is something under the first disorderly
transport of the humours so unaccountably becalming in an orderly and a
sober walk towards one of them that I have often wondered that neither
Pythagoras nor Plato nor Solon nor Lycurgus nor Mahomet nor any one
of your noted lawgivers ever gave order about them



Chapter 2LIII

Your honour said Trim shutting the parlourdoor before he began to
speak has heard I imagine of this unlucky accidentO yes Trim said
my uncle Toby and it gives me great concernI am heartily concerned
too but I hope your honour replied Trim will do me the justice
to believe that it was not in the least owing to meTo
theeTrimcried my uncle Toby looking kindly in his facetwas
Susannahs and the curates folly betwixt themWhat business could
they have together an please your honour in the gardenIn the
gallery thou meanest replied my uncle Toby

Trim found he was upon a wrong scent and stopped short with a low
bowTwo misfortunes quoth the corporal to himself are twice as many
at least as are needful to be talked over at one timethe mischief the
cow has done in breaking into the fortifications may be told his honour
hereafterTrims casuistry and address under the cover of his low
bow prevented all suspicion in my uncle Toby so he went on with what
he had to say to Trim as follows

For my own part Trim though I can see little or no difference
betwixt my nephews being called Tristram or Trismegistusyet as the
thing sits so near my brothers heart TrimI would freely have given
a hundred pounds rather than it should have happenedA hundred pounds
an please your honour replied TrimI would not give a cherrystone
to bootNor would I Trim upon my own account quoth my uncle
Tobybut my brother whom there is no arguing with in this
casemaintains that a great deal more depends Trim upon
christiannames than what ignorant people imaginefor he says there
never was a great or heroic action performed since the world began by
one called Tristramnay he will have it Trim that a man can
neither be learned or wise or braveTis all fancy an please your
honourI fought just as well replied the corporal when the regiment
called me Trim as when they called me James ButlerAnd for my own
part said my uncle Toby though I should blush to boast of myself
Trimyet had my name been Alexander I could have done no more at Namur
than my dutyBless your honour cried Trim advancing three steps as
he spoke does a man think of his christianname when he goes upon the
attackOr when he stands in the trench Trim cried my uncle Toby
looking firmOr when he enters a breach said Trim pushing in between
two chairsOr forces the lines cried my uncle rising up and pushing
his crutch like a pikeOr facing a platoon cried Trim presenting his
stick like a firelockOr when he marches up the glacis cried my uncle
Toby looking warm and setting his foot upon his stool



Chapter 2LIV

My father was returned from his walk to the fishpondand opened the
parlourdoor in the very height of the attack just as my uncle Toby was
marching up the glacisTrim recovered his armsnever was my uncle Toby
caught in riding at such a desperate rate in his life Alas my uncle
Toby had not a weightier matter called forth all the ready eloquence
of my fatherhow hadst thou then and thy poor HobbyHorse too been
insulted

My father hung up his hat with the same air he took it down and after
giving a slight look at the disorder of the room he took hold of one
of the chairs which had formed the corporals breach and placing
it overagainst my uncle Toby he sat down in it and as soon as
the teathings were taken away and the door shut he broke out in a
lamentation as follows



My Fathers Lamentation

It is in vain longer said my father addressing himself as much
to Ernulphuss curse which was laid upon the corner of the
chimneypieceas to my uncle Toby who sat under itit is in vain
longer said my father in the most querulous monotony imaginable
to struggle as I have done against this most uncomfortable of human
persuasionsI see it plainly that either for my own sins brother
Toby or the sins and follies of the Shandy family Heaven has thought
fit to draw forth the heaviest of its artillery against me and that the
prosperity of my child is the point upon which the whole force of it is
directed to playSuch a thing would batter the whole universe about
our ears brother Shandy said my uncle Tobyif it was soUnhappy
Tristram child of wrath child of decrepitude interruption mistake
and discontent What one misfortune or disaster in the book of embryotic
evils that could unmechanize thy frame or entangle thy filaments
which has not fallen upon thy head or ever thou camest into the
worldwhat evils in thy passage into itwhat evils sinceproduced
into being in the decline of thy fathers dayswhen the powers of his
imagination and of his body were waxing feeblewhen radical heat and
radical moisture the elements which should have temperd thine were
drying up and nothing left to found thy stamina in but negationstis
pitifulbrother Toby at the best and called out for all the little
helps that care and attention on both sides could give it But how were
we defeated You know the event brother Tobytis too melancholy a
one to be repeated nowwhen the few animal spirits I was worth in the
world and with which memory fancy and quick parts should have been
conveydwere all dispersed confused confounded scattered and sent
to the devil

Here then was the time to have put a stop to this persecution against
himand tried an experiment at leastwhether calmness and serenity
of mind in your sister with a due attention brother Toby to her
evacuations and repletionsand the rest of her nonnaturals might not
in a course of nine months gestation have set all things to rightsMy
child was bereft of theseWhat a teazing life did she lead herself
and consequently her foetus too with that nonsensical anxiety of hers
about lyingin in town I thought my sister submitted with the greatest
patience replied my uncle TobyI never heard her utter one fretful
word about itShe fumed inwardly cried my father and that let me
tell you brother was ten times worse for the childand then what
battles did she fight with me and what perpetual storms about the
midwifeThere she gave vent said my uncle TobyVent cried my
father looking up

But what was all this my dear Toby to the injuries done us by my
childs coming head foremost into the world when all I wished in
this general wreck of his frame was to have saved this little casket
unbroke unrifled

With all my precautions how was my system turned topsideturvy in the
womb with my child his head exposed to the hand of violence and a
pressure of 470 pounds avoirdupois weight acting so perpendicularly upon
its apexthat at this hour tis ninety per Cent insurance that the
fine network of the intellectual web be not rent and torn to a thousand
tatters

Still we could have doneFool coxcomb puppygive him but a
NoseCripple Dwarf Driveller Goosecapshape him as you will the
door of fortune stands openO Licetus Licetus had I been blest with a
foetus five inches long and a half like theeFate might have done her
worst

Still brother Toby there was one cast of the dye left for our child
after allO Tristram Tristram Tristram

We will send for Mr Yorick said my uncle Toby

You may send for whom you will replied my father

You have done it replied my accuser

I deny it quoth I and so have got off and here am I standing with my
bridle in one hand and with my cap in the other to tell my storyAnd
what in it You shall hear in the next chapter



Chapter 2LVI

As Francis the first of France was one winterly night warming himself
over the embers of a wood fire and talking with his first minister of
sundry things for the good of the state Vide Menagiana Vol IIt
would not be amiss said the king stirring up the embers with his
cane if this good understanding betwixt ourselves and Switzerland was
a little strengthenedThere is no end Sire replied the minister
in giving money to these peoplethey would swallow up the treasury
of FrancePoo poo answered the kingthere are more ways Mons
le Premier of bribing states besides that of giving moneyIll pay
Switzerland the honour of standing godfather for my next childYour
majesty said the minister in so doing would have all the grammarians
in Europe upon your backSwitzerland as a republic being a female
can in no construction be godfatherShe may be godmother replied
Francis hastilyso announce my intentions by a courier tomorrow
morning

I am astonished said Francis the First that day fortnight speaking
to his minister as he entered the closet that we have had no answer
from SwitzerlandSire I wait upon you this moment said Mons le
Premier to lay before you my dispatches upon that businessThey take
it kindly said the kingThey do Sire replied the minister and
have the highest sense of the honour your majesty has done thembut the
republick as godmother claims her right in this case of naming the
child

In all reason quoth the kingshe will christen him Francis or Henry
or Lewis or some name that she knows will be agreeable to us Your
majesty is deceived replied the ministerI have this hour received a
dispatch from our resident with the determination of the republic on
that point alsoAnd what name has the republick fixed upon for the
DauphinShadrach Mesech Abednego replied the ministerBy Saint
Peters girdle I will have nothing to do with the Swiss cried Francis
the First pulling up his breeches and walking hastily across the floor

Your majesty replied the minister calmly cannot bring yourself off

Well pay them in moneysaid the king

Sire there are not sixty thousand crowns in the treasury answered
the ministerIll pawn the best jewel in my crown quoth Francis the
First

Your honour stands pawnd already in this matter answered Monsieur le
Premier

Then Mons le Premier said the king bywell go to war with em



Chapter 2LVII

Albeit gentle reader I have lusted earnestly and endeavoured
carefully according to the measure of such a slender skill as God has
vouchsafed me and as convenient leisure from other occasions of needful
profit and healthful pastime have permitted that these little books
which I here put into thy hands might stand instead of many bigger
booksyet have I carried myself towards thee in such fanciful guise of
careless disport that right sore am I ashamed now to intreat thy lenity
seriouslyin beseeching thee to believe it of me that in the story of
my father and his christiannamesI have no thoughts of treading upon
Francis the Firstnor in the affair of the noseupon Francis the
Ninthnor in the character of my uncle Tobyof characterizing the
militiating spirits of my countrythe wound upon his groin is a wound
to every comparison of that kindnor by Trimthat I meant the duke of
Ormondor that my book is wrote against predestination or freewill
or taxesIf tis wrote against any thingtis wrote an please your
worships against the spleen in order by a more frequent and a
more convulsive elevation and depression of the diaphragm and the
succussations of the intercostal and abdominal muscles in laughter to
drive the gall and other bitter juices from the gallbladder liver
and sweetbread of his majestys subjects with all the inimicitious
passions which belong to them down into their duodenums



Chapter 2LVIII

But can the thing be undone Yorick said my fatherfor in my
opinion continued he it cannot I am a vile canonist replied
Yorickbut of all evils holding suspence to be the most tormenting
we shall at least know the worst of this matter I hate these great
dinnerssaid my fatherThe size of the dinner is not the point
answered Yorickwe want Mr Shandy to dive into the bottom of this
doubt whether the name can be changed or notand as the beards of so
many commissaries officials advocates proctors registers and of the
most eminent of our schooldivines and others are all to meet in the
middle of one table and Didius has so pressingly invited youwho
in your distress would miss such an occasion All that is requisite
continued Yorick is to apprize Didius and let him manage a
conversation after dinner so as to introduce the subjectThen my
brother Toby cried my father clapping his two hands together shall go
with us

Let my old tyewig quoth my uncle Toby and my laced regimentals be
hung to the fire all night Trim

page numbering skips ten pages



Chapter 2LX

No doubt Sirthere is a whole chapter wanting hereand a chasm of
ten pages made in the book by itbut the bookbinder is neither a fool
or a knave or a puppynor is the book a jot more imperfect at least
upon that scorebut on the contrary the book is more perfect and
complete by wanting the chapter than having it as I shall demonstrate
to your reverences in this mannerI question first bythebye
whether the same experiment might not be made as successfully upon
sundry other chaptersbut there is no end an please your reverences
in trying experiments upon chapterswe have had enough of itSo
theres an end of that matter

But before I begin my demonstration let me only tell you that the
chapter which I have torn out and which otherwise you would all have
been reading just now instead of thiswas the description of my
fathers my uncle Tobys Trims and Obadiahs setting out and
journeying to the visitation at

Well go in the coach said my fatherPrithee have the arms been
altered ObadiahIt would have made my story much better to have begun
with telling you that at the time my mothers arms were added to the
Shandys when the coach was repainted upon my fathers marriage it
had so fallen out that the coachpainter whether by performing all his
works with the left hand like Turpilius the Roman or Hans Holbein of
Basilor whether twas more from the blunder of his head than handor
whether lastly it was from the sinister turn which every thing
relating to our family was apt to takeit so fell out however to
our reproach that instead of the benddexter which since Harry the
Eighths reign was honestly our duea bendsinister by some of these
fatalities had been drawn quite across the field of the Shandy arms
Tis scarce credible that the mind of so wise a man as my father was
could be so much incommoded with so small a matter The word coachlet
it be whose it wouldor coachman or coachhorse or coachhire could
never be named in the family but he constantly complained of carrying
this vile mark of illegitimacy upon the door of his own he never once
was able to step into the coach or out of it without turning round to
take a view of the arms and making a vow at the same time that it
was the last time he would ever set his foot in it again till the
bendsinister was taken outbut like the affair of the hinge it was
one of the many things which the Destinies had set down in their books
ever to be grumbled at and in wiser families than oursbut never to
be mended

Has the bendsinister been brushd out I say said my fatherThere
has been nothing brushd out Sir answered Obadiah but the lining
Well go ohorseback said my father turning to YorickOf all things
in the world except politicks the clergy know the least of heraldry
said YorickNo matter for that cried my fatherI should be sorry
to appear with a blot in my escutcheon before themNever mind the
bendsinister said my uncle Toby putting on his tyewigNo indeed
said my fatheryou may go with my aunt Dinah to a visitation with a
bendsinister if you think fitMy poor uncle Toby blushd My father
was vexed at himselfNomy dear brother Toby said my father
changing his tonebut the damp of the coachlining about my loins may
give me the sciatica again as it did December January and February
last winterso if you please you shall ride my wifes padand as
you are to preach Yorick you had better make the best of your way
beforeand leave me to take care of my brother Toby and to follow at
our own rates

Now the chapter I was obliged to tear out was the description of this
cavalcade in which Corporal Trim and Obadiah upon two coachhorses
abreast led the way as slow as a patrolewhilst my uncle Toby in
his laced regimentals and tyewig kept his rank with my father in deep
roads and dissertations alternately upon the advantage of learning and
arms as each could get the start

But the painting of this journey upon reviewing it appears to be so
much above the stile and manner of any thing else I have been able
to paint in this book that it could not have remained in it without
depreciating every other scene and destroying at the same time that
necessary equipoise and balance whether of good or bad betwixt
chapter and chapter from whence the just proportions and harmony of
the whole work results For my own part I am but just set up in the
business so know little about itbut in my opinion to write a book
is for all the world like humming a songbe but in tune with yourself
madam tis no matter how high or how low you take it

This is the reason may it please your reverences that some of the
lowest and flattest compositions pass off very wellas Yorick told my
uncle Toby one night by siegeMy uncle Toby looked brisk at the sound
of the word siege but could make neither head or tail of it

Im to preach at court next Sunday said Homenasrun over my notesso
I hummd over doctor Homenass notesthe modulations very welltwill
do Homenas if it holds on at this rateso on I hummdand a
tolerable tune I thought it was and to this hour may it please your
reverences had never found out how low how flat how spiritless and
jejune it was but that all of a sudden up started an air in the middle
of it so fine so rich so heavenlyit carried my soul up with it
into the other world now had I as Montaigne complained in a
parallel accidenthad I found the declivity easy or the ascent
accessiblecertes I had been outwittedYour notes Homenas I should
have said are good notesbut it was so perpendicular a precipiceso
wholly cut off from the rest of the work that by the first note I
hummd I found myself flying into the other world and from thence
discovered the vale from whence I came so deep so low and dismal
that I shall never have the heart to descend into it again

A dwarf who brings a standard along with him to measure his own
sizetake my word is a dwarf in more articles than oneAnd so much
for tearing out of chapters



Chapter 2LXI

See if he is not cutting it into slips and giving them about him to
light their pipesTis abominable answered Didius it should not
go unnoticed said doctor Kysarciushe was of the Kysarcii of the Low
Countries

Methinks said Didius half rising from his chair in order to remove a
bottle and a tall decanter which stood in a direct line betwixt him and
Yorickyou might have spared this sarcastic stroke and have hit upon
a more proper place Mr Yorickor at least upon a more proper occasion
to have shewn your contempt of what we have been about If the sermon is
of no better worth than to light pipes withtwas certainly Sir not
good enough to be preached before so learned a body and if twas good
enough to be preached before so learned a bodytwas certainly Sir too
good to light their pipes with afterwards

I have got him fast hung up quoth Didius to himself upon one of the
two horns of my dilemmalet him get off as he can

I have undergone such unspeakable torments in bringing forth this
sermon quoth Yorick upon this occasionthat I declare Didius I
would suffer martyrdomand if it was possible my horse with me a
thousand times over before I would sit down and make such another I
was delivered of it at the wrong end of meit came from my head instead
of my heartand it is for the pain it gave me both in the writing and
preaching of it that I revenge myself of it in this mannerTo preach
to shew the extent of our reading or the subtleties of our witto
parade in the eyes of the vulgar with the beggarly accounts of a little
learning tinseld over with a few words which glitter but convey
little light and less warmthis a dishonest use of the poor single
half hour in a week which is put into our handsTis not preaching the
gospelbut ourselvesFor my own part continued Yorick I had rather
direct five words pointblank to the heartAs Yorick pronounced
the word pointblank my uncle Toby rose up to say something upon
projectileswhen a single word and no more uttered from the opposite
side of the table drew every ones ears towards ita word of all others
in the dictionary the last in that place to be expecteda word I am

Ill tell it in the next chapter



Chapter 2LXII

ZoundsZds cried Phutatorius partly to himselfand yet high
enough to be heardand what seemed odd twas uttered in a construction
of look and in a tone of voice somewhat between that of a man in
amazement and one in bodily pain

One or two who had very nice ears and could distinguish the expression
and mixture of the two tones as plainly as a third or a fifth or any
other chord in musickwere the most puzzled and perplexed with itthe
concord was good in itselfbut then twas quite out of the key and
no way applicable to the subject startedso that with all their
knowledge they could not tell what in the world to make of it

Others who knew nothing of musical expression and merely lent their
ears to the plain import of the word imagined that Phutatorius who was
somewhat of a cholerick spirit was just going to snatch the cudgels out
of Didiuss hands in order to bemaul Yorick to some purposeand that
the desperate monosyllable Zds was the exordium to an oration which
as they judged from the sample presaged but a rough kind of handling of
him so that my uncle Tobys goodnature felt a pang for what Yorick was
about to undergo But seeing Phutatorius stop short without any attempt
or desire to go ona third party began to suppose that it was no more
than an involuntary respiration casually forming itself into the shape
of a twelvepenny oathwithout the sin or substance of one

Others and especially one or two who sat next him looked upon it on
the contrary as a real and substantial oath propensly formed against
Yorick to whom he was known to bear no good likingwhich said oath
as my father philosophized upon it actually lay fretting and fuming at
that very time in the upper regions of Phutatoriuss purtenance and so
was naturally and according to the due course of things first squeezed
out by the sudden influx of blood which was driven into the right
ventricle of Phutatoriuss heart by the stroke of surprize which so
strange a theory of preaching had excited

How finely we argue upon mistaken facts

There was not a soul busied in all these various reasonings upon the
monosyllable which Phutatorius utteredwho did not take this for
granted proceeding upon it as from an axiom namely that Phutatoriuss
mind was intent upon the subject of debate which was arising between
Didius and Yorick and indeed as he looked first towards the one and
then towards the other with the air of a man listening to what was
going forwardswho would not have thought the same But the truth
was that Phutatorius knew not one word or one syllable of what was
passingbut his whole thoughts and attention were taken up with a
transaction which was going forwards at that very instant within the
precincts of his own Galligaskins and in a part of them where of
all others he stood most interested to watch accidents So that
notwithstanding he looked with all the attention in the world and had
gradually skrewed up every nerve and muscle in his face to the utmost
pitch the instrument would bear in order as it was thought to give a
sharp reply to Yorick who sat overagainst himyet I say was Yorick
never once in any one domicile of Phutatoriuss brainbut the true
cause of his exclamation lay at least a yard below

This I will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable decency

You must be informed then that Gastripheres who had taken a turn into
the kitchen a little before dinner to see how things went onobserving
a wickerbasket of fine chesnuts standing upon the dresser had ordered
that a hundred or two of them might be roasted and sent in as soon
as dinner was overGastripheres inforcing his orders about them that
Didius but Phutatorius especially were particularly fond of em

About two minutes before the time that my uncle Toby interrupted
Yoricks harangueGastripheress chesnuts were brought inand as
Phutatoriuss fondness for em was uppermost in the waiters head he
laid them directly before Phutatorius wrapt up hot in a clean damask
napkin

Now whether it was physically impossible with half a dozen hands all
thrust into the napkin at a timebut that some one chesnut of more
life and rotundity than the rest must be put in motionit so fell
out however that one was actually sent rolling off the table and
as Phutatorius sat straddling underit fell perpendicularly into that
particular aperture of Phutatoriuss breeches for which to the shame
and indelicacy of our language be it spoke there is no chaste word
throughout all Johnsons dictionarylet it suffice to sayit was that
particular aperture which in all good societies the laws of decorum
do strictly require like the temple of Janus in peace at least to be
universally shut up

The neglect of this punctilio in Phutatorius which bythebye should be
a warning to all mankind had opened a door to this accident

Accident I call it in compliance to a received mode of speakingbut
in no opposition to the opinion either of Acrites or Mythogeras in
this matter I know they were both prepossessed and fully persuaded of
itand are so to this hour That there was nothing of accident in the
whole eventbut that the chesnuts taking that particular course
and in a manner of its own accordand then falling with all its heat
directly into that one particular place and no otherwas a real
judgment upon Phutatorius for that filthy and obscene treatise de
Concubinis retinendis which Phutatorius had published about twenty
years agoand was that identical week going to give the world a second
edition of

It is not my business to dip my pen in this controversymuch
undoubtedly may be wrote on both sides of the questionall that
concerns me as an historian is to represent the matter of fact and
render it credible to the reader that the hiatus in Phutatoriuss
breeches was sufficiently wide to receive the chesnutand that the
chesnut somehow or other did fall perpendicularly and piping hot into
it without Phutatoriuss perceiving it or any one else at that time

The genial warmth which the chesnut imparted was not undelectable for
the first twenty or fiveandtwenty secondsand did no more than
gently solicit Phutatoriuss attention towards the partBut the heat
gradually increasing and in a few seconds more getting beyond the
point of all sober pleasure and then advancing with all speed into the
regions of pain the soul of Phutatorius together with all his ideas
his thoughts his attention his imagination judgment resolution
deliberation ratiocination memory fancy with ten battalions of
animal spirits all tumultuously crowded down through different defiles
and circuits to the place of danger leaving all his upper regions as
you may imagine as empty as my purse

With the best intelligence which all these messengers could bring him
back Phutatorius was not able to dive into the secret of what was going
forwards below nor could he make any kind of conjecture what the devil
was the matter with it However as he knew not what the true cause
might turn out he deemed it most prudent in the situation he was in at
present to bear it if possible like a Stoick which with the help
of some wry faces and compursions of the mouth he had certainly
accomplished had his imagination continued neuterbut the sallies
of the imagination are ungovernable in things of this kinda thought
instantly darted into his mind that tho the anguish had the sensation
of glowing heatit might notwithstanding that be a bite as well as a
burn and if so that possibly a Newt or an Asker or some such detested
reptile had crept up and was fastening his teeththe horrid idea of
which with a fresh glow of pain arising that instant from the chesnut
seized Phutatorius with a sudden panick and in the first terrifying
disorder of the passion it threw him as it has done the best generals
upon earth quite off his guardthe effect of which was this that
he leapt incontinently up uttering as he rose that interjection of
surprise so much descanted upon with the aposiopestic break after it
marked thus Zdswhich though not strictly canonical was still
as little as any man could have said upon the occasionand which
bythebye whether canonical or not Phutatorius could no more help
than he could the cause of it

Though this has taken up some time in the narrative it took up little
more time in the transaction than just to allow time for Phutatorius
to draw forth the chesnut and throw it down with violence upon the
floorand for Yorick to rise from his chair and pick the chesnut up

It is curious to observe the triumph of slight incidents over the
mindWhat incredible weight they have in forming and governing our
opinions both of men and thingsthat trifles light as air shall
waft a belief into the soul and plant it so immoveably within itthat
Euclids demonstrations could they be brought to batter it in breach
should not all have power to overthrow it

Yorick I said picked up the chesnut which Phutatoriuss wrath had
flung downthe action was triflingI am ashamed to account for ithe
did it for no reason but that he thought the chesnut not a jot worse
for the adventureand that he held a good chesnut worth stooping
forBut this incident trifling as it was wrought differently in
Phutatoriuss head He considered this act of Yoricks in getting off
his chair and picking up the chesnut as a plain acknowledgment in him
that the chesnut was originally hisand in course that it must have
been the owner of the chesnut and no one else who could have played
him such a prank with it What greatly confirmed him in this opinion
was this that the table being parallelogramical and very narrow it
afforded a fair opportunity for Yorick who sat directly over against
Phutatorius of slipping the chesnut inand consequently that he did
it The look of something more than suspicion which Phutatorius cast
full upon Yorick as these thoughts arose too evidently spoke his
opinionand as Phutatorius was naturally supposed to know more of the
matter than any person besides his opinion at once became the general
oneand for a reason very different from any which have been yet
givenin a little time it was put out of all manner of dispute

When great or unexpected events fall out upon the stage of this
sublunary worldthe mind of man which is an inquisitive kind of a
substance naturally takes a flight behind the scenes to see what is
the cause and first spring of themThe search was not long in this
instance

It was well known that Yorick had never a good opinion of the treatise
which Phutatorius had wrote de Concubinis retinendis as a thing which
he feared had done hurt in the worldand twas easily found out that
there was a mystical meaning in Yoricks prankand that his chucking
the chesnut hot into Phutatoriuss was a sarcastical fling at
his bookthe doctrines of which they said had enflamed many an honest
man in the same place

This conceit awakend Somnolentusmade Agelastes smileand if you can
recollect the precise look and air of a mans face intent in finding
out a riddleit threw Gastripheress into that formand in short was
thought by many to be a masterstroke of archwit

This as the reader has seen from one end to the other was as
groundless as the dreams of philosophy Yorick no doubt as Shakespeare
said of his ancestorwas a man of jest but it was temperd with
something which withheld him from that and many other ungracious
pranks of which he as undeservedly bore the blamebut it was his
misfortune all his life long to bear the imputation of saying and doing
a thousand things of which unless my esteem blinds me his nature was
incapable All I blame him foror rather all I blame and alternately
like him for was that singularity of his temper which would never
suffer him to take pains to set a story right with the world however in
his power In every ill usage of that sort he acted precisely as in the
affair of his lean horsehe could have explained it to his honour but
his spirit was above it and besides he ever looked upon the inventor
the propagator and believer of an illiberal report alike so injurious
to himhe could not stoop to tell his story to themand so trusted to
time and truth to do it for him

This heroic cast produced him inconveniences in many respectsin the
present it was followed by the fixed resentment of Phutatorius who
as Yorick had just made an end of his chesnut rose up from his chair
a second time to let him know itwhich indeed he did with a smile
saying onlythat he would endeavour not to forget the obligation

But you must mark and carefully separate and distinguish these two
things in your mind

The smile was for the company

The threat was for Yorick



Chapter 2LXIII

Can you tell me quoth Phutatorius speaking to Gastripheres who
sat next to himfor one would not apply to a surgeon in so foolish
an affaircan you tell me Gastripheres what is best to take out the
fireAsk Eugenius said GastripheresThat greatly depends said
Eugenius pretending ignorance of the adventure upon the nature of the
partIf it is a tender part and a part which can conveniently be wrapt
upIt is both the one and the other replied Phutatorius laying his
hand as he spoke with an emphatical nod of his head upon the part
in question and lifting up his right leg at the same time to ease and
ventilate itIf that is the case said Eugenius I would advise you
Phutatorius not to tamper with it by any means but if you will send to
the next printer and trust your cure to such a simple thing as a soft
sheet of paper just come off the pressyou need do nothing more than
twist it roundThe damp paper quoth Yorick who sat next to his
friend Eugenius though I know it has a refreshing coolness in ityet
I presume is no more than the vehicleand that the oil and
lampblack with which the paper is so strongly impregnated does the
businessRight said Eugenius and is of any outward application I
would venture to recommend the most anodyne and safe

Was it my case said Gastripheres as the main thing is the oil and
lampblack I should spread them thick upon a rag and clap it on
directlyThat would make a very devil of it replied YorickAnd
besides added Eugenius it would not answer the intention which is
the extreme neatness and elegance of the prescription which the Faculty
hold to be half in halffor consider if the type is a very small one
which it should be the sanative particles which come into contact in
this form have the advantage of being spread so infinitely thin and
with such a mathematical equality fresh paragraphs and large capitals
excepted as no art or management of the spatula can come up toIt
falls out very luckily replied Phutatorius that the second edition
of my treatise de Concubinis retinendis is at this instant in
the pressYou may take any leaf of it said Eugeniusno matter
whichProvided quoth Yorick there is no bawdry in it

They are just now replied Phutatorius printing off the ninth
chapterwhich is the last chapter but one in the bookPray what
is the title of that chapter said Yorick making a respectful bow to
Phutatorius as he spokeI think answered Phutatorius tis that de re
concubinaria

For Heavens sake keep out of that chapter quoth Yorick

By all meansadded Eugenius



Chapter 2LXIV

Now quoth Didius rising up and laying his right hand with
his fingers spread upon his breasthad such a blunder about a
christianname happened before the ReformationIt happened the day
before yesterday quoth my uncle Toby to himselfand when baptism
was administerd in LatinTwas all in English said my unclemany
things might have coincided with it and upon the authority of sundry
decreed cases to have pronounced the baptism null with a power of
giving the child a new nameHad a priest for instance which was no
uncommon thing through ignorance of the Latin tongue baptized a child
of TomoStiles in nomine patriae  filia  spiritum sanctosthe
baptism was held nullI beg your pardon replied Kysarciusin
that case as the mistake was only the terminations the baptism was
validand to have rendered it null the blunder of the priest should
have fallen upon the first syllable of each nounand not as in your
case upon the last

My father delighted in subtleties of this kind and listend with
infinite attention

Gastripheres for example continued Kysarcius baptizes a child of
John Stradlings in Gomine gatris c c instead of in Nomine patris
cIs this a baptism Nosay the ablest canonists in as much as the
radix of each word is hereby torn up and the sense and meaning of them
removed and changed quite to another object for Gomine does not signify
a name nor gatris a fatherWhat do they signify said my uncle
TobyNothing at allquoth YorickErgo such a baptism is null said
Kysarcius

In course answered Yorick in a tone two parts jest and one part
earnestBut in the case cited continued Kysarcius where patriae is
put for patris filia for filii and so onas it is a fault only in
the declension and the roots of the words continue untouchd the
inflections of their branches either this way or that does not in any
sort hinder the baptism inasmuch as the same sense continues in the
words as beforeBut then said Didius the intention of the priests
pronouncing them grammatically must have been proved to have gone along
with itRight answered Kysarcius and of this brother Didius we
have an instance in a decree of the decretals of Pope Leo the IIIdBut
my brothers child cried my uncle Toby has nothing to do with the
Popetis the plain child of a Protestant gentleman christend
Tristram against the wills and wishes both of his father and mother and
all who are akin to it

If the wills and wishes said Kysarcius interrupting my uncle Toby of
those only who stand related to Mr Shandys child were to have weight
in this matter Mrs Shandy of all people has the least to do in
itMy uncle Toby layd down his pipe and my father drew his chair
still closer to the table to hear the conclusion of so strange an
introduction

It has not only been a question Captain Shandy amongst the Vide
Swinburn on Testaments Part 7 para 8 best lawyers and civilians in
this land continued Kysarcius Whether the mother be of kin to her
childbut after much dispassionate enquiry and jactitation of the
arguments on all sidesit has been adjudged for the negativenamely
That the mother is not of kin to her child Vide Brook Abridg Tit
Administr N 47 My father instantly clappd his hand upon my uncle
Tobys mouth under colour of whispering in his earthe truth was he
was alarmed for Lillabulleroand having a great desire to hear more of
so curious an argumenthe beggd my uncle Toby for heavens sake not
to disappoint him in itMy uncle Toby gave a nodresumed his pipe
and contenting himself with whistling Lillabullero inwardlyKysarcius
Didius and Triptolemus went on with the discourse as follows

This determination continued Kysarcius how contrary soever it may seem
to run to the stream of vulgar ideas yet had reason strongly on its
side and has been put out of all manner of dispute from the famous
case known commonly by the name of the Duke of Suffolks caseIt
is cited in Brook said TriptolemusAnd taken notice of by Lord Coke
added DidiusAnd you may find it in Swinburn on Testaments said
Kysarcius

The case Mr Shandy was this

In the reign of Edward the Sixth Charles duke of Suffolk having issue a
son by one venter and a daughter by another venter made his last will
wherein he devised goods to his son and died after whose death the son
died alsobut without will without wife and without childhis mother
and his sister by the fathers side for she was born of the former
venter then living The mother took the administration of her sons
goods according to the statute of the 21st of Harry the Eighth whereby
it is enacted That in case any person die intestate the administration
of his goods shall be committed to the next of kin

The administration being thus surreptitiously granted to the
mother the sister by the fathers side commenced a suit before the
Ecclesiastical Judge alledging 1st That she herself was next of kin
and 2dly That the mother was not of kin at all to the party deceased
and therefore prayed the court that the administration granted to the
mother might be revoked and be committed unto her as next of kin to
the deceased by force of the said statute

Hereupon as it was a great cause and much depending upon its
issueand many causes of great property likely to be decided in times
to come by the precedent to be then madethe most learned as well in
the laws of this realm as in the civil law were consulted together
whether the mother was of kin to her son or noWhereunto not only
the temporal lawyersbut the church lawyersthe jurisconsultithe
jurisprudentesthe civiliansthe advocatesthe commissariesthe
judges of the consistory and prerogative courts of Canterbury and York
with the master of the faculties were all unanimously of opinion That
the mother was not of Mater non numeratur inter consanguineos Bald in
ult C de Verb signific kin to her child

And what said the duchess of Suffolk to it said my uncle Toby

The unexpectedness of my uncle Tobys question confounded Kysarcius
more than the ablest advocateHe stoppd a full minute looking in
my uncle Tobys face without replyingand in that single minute
Triptolemus put by him and took the lead as follows

Tis a ground and principle in the law said Triptolemus that things do
not ascend but descend in it and I make no doubt tis for this cause
that however true it is that the child may be of the blood and seed of
its parentsthat the parents nevertheless are not of the blood and
seed of it inasmuch as the parents are not begot by the child but the
child by the parentsFor so they write Liberi sunt de sanguine patris
 matris sed pater  mater non sunt de sanguine liberorum

But this Triptolemus cried Didius proves too muchfor from this
authority cited it would follow not only what indeed is granted on
all sides that the mother is not of kin to her childbut the father
likewiseIt is held said Triptolemus the better opinion because the
father the mother and the child though they be three persons yet
are they but una caro Vide Brook Abridg tit Administr N47 one
flesh and consequently no degree of kindredor any method of acquiring
one in natureThere you push the argument again too far cried
Didiusfor there is no prohibition in nature though there is in the
Levitical lawbut that a man may beget a child upon his grandmotherin
which case supposing the issue a daughter she would stand in relation
both ofBut who ever thought cried Kysarcius of laying with his
grandmotherThe young gentleman replied Yorick whom Selden speaks
ofwho not only thought of it but justified his intention to his
father by the argument drawn from the law of retaliationYou
laid Sir with my mother said the ladwhy may not I lay with
yoursTis the Argumentum commune added YorickTis as good
replied Eugenius taking down his hat as they deserve

The company broke up



Chapter 2LXV

And pray said my uncle Toby leaning upon Yorick as he and my father
were helping him leisurely down the stairsdont be terrified madam
this staircase conversation is not so long as the lastAnd pray
Yorick said my uncle Toby which way is this said affair of Tristram
at length settled by these learned men Very satisfactorily replied
Yorick no mortal Sir has any concern with itfor Mrs Shandy the
mother is nothing at all akin to himand as the mothers is the surest
sideMr Shandy in course is still less than nothingIn short he is
not as much akin to him Sir as I am

That may well be said my father shaking his head

Let the learned say what they will there must certainly quoth my
uncle Toby have been some sort of consanguinity betwixt the duchess of
Suffolk and her son

The vulgar are of the same opinion quoth Yorick to this hour



Chapter 2LXVI

Though my father was hugely tickled with the subtleties of these learned
discoursestwas still but like the anointing of a broken boneThe
moment he got home the weight of his afflictions returned upon him but
so much the heavier as is ever the case when the staff we lean on
slips from under usHe became pensivewalked frequently forth to
the fishpondlet down one loop of his hatsighd oftenforbore to
snapand as the hasty sparks of temper which occasion snapping so
much assist perspiration and digestion as Hippocrates tells ushe had
certainly fallen ill with the extinction of them had not his thoughts
been critically drawn off and his health rescued by a fresh train of
disquietudes left him with a legacy of a thousand pounds by my aunt
Dinah

My father had scarce read the letter when taking the thing by the right
end he instantly began to plague and puzzle his head how to lay it out
mostly to the honour of his familyA hundredandfifty odd projects
took possession of his brains by turnshe would do this and that and
totherHe would go to Romehe would go to lawhe would buy stockhe
would buy John Hobsons farmhe would new fore front his house and add
a new wing to make it evenThere was a fine watermill on this side
and he would build a windmill on the other side of the river in full
view to answer itBut above all things in the world he would inclose
the great Oxmoor and send out my brother Bobby immediately upon his
travels

But as the sum was finite and consequently could not do every
thingand in truth very few of these to any purposeof all the
projects which offered themselves upon this occasion the two last
seemed to make the deepest impression and he would infallibly have
determined upon both at once but for the small inconvenience hinted at
above which absolutely put him under a necessity of deciding in favour
either of the one or the other

This was not altogether so easy to be done for though tis certain
my father had long before set his heart upon this necessary part of my
brothers education and like a prudent man had actually determined to
carry it into execution with the first money that returned from the
second creation of actions in the Missisippischeme in which he was an
adventureryet the Oxmoor which was a fine large whinny undrained
unimproved common belonging to the Shandyestate had almost as old
a claim upon him he had long and affectionately set his heart upon
turning it likewise to some account

But having never hitherto been pressed with such a conjuncture of
things as made it necessary to settle either the priority or justice of
their claimslike a wise man he had refrained entering into any nice
or critical examination about them so that upon the dismission of every
other project at this crisisthe two old projects the Oxmoor and
my Brother divided him again and so equal a match were they for
each other as to become the occasion of no small contest in the old
gentlemans mindwhich of the two should be set ogoing first

People may laugh as they willbut the case was this

It had ever been the custom of the family and by length of time was
almost become a matter of common right that the eldest son of it
should have free ingress egress and regress into foreign parts before
marriagenot only for the sake of bettering his own private parts by
the benefit of exercise and change of so much airbut simply for the
mere delectation of his fancy by the feather put into his cap of
having been abroadtantum valet my father would say quantum sonat

Now as this was a reasonable and in course a most christian
indulgenceto deprive him of it without why or whereforeand thereby
make an example of him as the first Shandy unwhirld about Europe in a
postchaise and only because he was a heavy ladwould be using him ten
times worse than a Turk

On the other hand the case of the Oxmoor was full as hard

Exclusive of the original purchasemoney which was eight hundred
poundsit had cost the family eight hundred pounds more in a lawsuit
about fifteen years beforebesides the Lord knows what trouble and
vexation

It had been moreover in possession of the Shandyfamily ever since the
middle of the last century and though it lay full in view before the
house bounded on one extremity by the watermill and on the other
by the projected windmill spoken of aboveand for all these reasons
seemed to have the fairest title of any part of the estate to the care
and protection of the familyyet by an unaccountable fatality common
to men as well as the ground they tread onit had all along most
shamefully been overlookd and to speak the truth of it had suffered
so much by it that it would have made any mans heart have bled
Obadiah said who understood the value of the land to have rode over
it and only seen the condition it was in

However as neither the purchasing this tract of groundnor indeed the
placing of it where it lay were either of them properly speaking of
my fathers doinghe had never thought himself any way concerned in
the affairtill the fifteen years before when the breaking out of
that cursed lawsuit mentioned above and which had arose about its
boundarieswhich being altogether my fathers own act and deed it
naturally awakened every other argument in its favour and upon summing
them all up together he saw not merely in interest but in honour he
was bound to do something for itand that now or never was the time

I think there must certainly have been a mixture of illluck in it that
the reasons on both sides should happen to be so equally balanced
by each other for though my father weighd them in all humours
and conditionsspent many an anxious hour in the most profound and
abstracted meditation upon what was best to be donereading books of
farming one daybooks of travels anotherlaying aside all passion
whateverviewing the arguments on both sides in all their lights and
circumstancescommuning every day with my uncle Tobyarguing
with Yorick and talking over the whole affair of the Oxmoor with
Obadiahyet nothing in all that time appeared so strongly in behalf of
the one which was not either strictly applicable to the other or at
least so far counterbalanced by some consideration of equal weight as
to keep the scales even

For to be sure with proper helps in the hands of some people tho the
Oxmoor would undoubtedly have made a different appearance in the world
from what it did or ever could do in the condition it layyet every
tittle of this was true with regard to my brother Bobbylet Obadiah
say what he would

In point of interestthe contest I own at first sight did not appear
so undecisive betwixt them for whenever my father took pen and ink
in hand and set about calculating the simple expence of paring and
burning and fencing in the Oxmoor c cwith the certain profit it
would bring him in returnthe latter turned out so prodigiously in his
way of working the account that you would have sworn the Oxmoor would
have carried all before it For it was plain he should reap a hundred
lasts of rape at twenty pounds a last the very first yearbesides an
excellent crop of wheat the year followingand the year after that
to speak within bounds a hundredbut in all likelihood a hundred and
fiftyif not two hundred quarters of pease and beansbesides potatoes
without endBut then to think he was all this while breeding up my
brother like a hog to eat themknocked all on the head again and
generally left the old gentleman in such a state of suspensethat as
he often declared to my uncle Tobyhe knew no more than his heels what
to do

No body but he who has felt it can conceive what a plaguing thing it
is to have a mans mind torn asunder by two projects of equal strength
both obstinately pulling in a contrary direction at the same time
for to say nothing of the havock which by a certain consequence is
unavoidably made by it all over the finer system of the nerves which
you know convey the animal spirits and more subtle juices from the heart
to the head and so onit is not to be told in what a degree such a
wayward kind of friction works upon the more gross and solid parts
wasting the fat and impairing the strength of a man every time as it
goes backwards and forwards

My father had certainly sunk under this evil as certainly as he had
done under that of my Christian Namehad he not been rescued out of
it as he was out of that by a fresh evilthe misfortune of my brother
Bobbys death

What is the life of man Is it not to shift from side to sidefrom
sorrow to sorrowto button up one cause of vexationand unbutton
another



Chapter 2LXVII

From this moment I am to be considered as heirapparent to the Shandy
familyand it is from this point properly that the story of my Life
and my Opinions sets out With all my hurry and precipitation I have
but been clearing the ground to raise the buildingand such a building
do I foresee it will turn out as never was planned and as never was
executed since Adam In less than five minutes I shall have thrown
my pen into the fire and the little drop of thick ink which is left
remaining at the bottom of my inkhorn after itI have but half a
score things to do in the timeI have a thing to namea thing to
lamenta thing to hopea thing to promise and a thing to threatenI
have a thing to supposea thing to declarea thing to conceala thing
to choose and a thing to pray forThis chapter therefore I name the
chapter of Thingsand my next chapter to it that is the first chapter
of my next volume if I live shall be my chapter upon Whiskers in
order to keep up some sort of connection in my works

The thing I lament is that things have crowded in so thick upon me
that I have not been able to get into that part of my work towards
which I have all the way looked forwards with so much earnest desire
and that is the Campaigns but especially the amours of my uncle Toby
the events of which are of so singular a nature and so Cervantick a
cast that if I can so manage it as to convey but the same impressions
to every other brain which the occurrences themselves excite in my
ownI will answer for it the book shall make its way in the world much
better than its master has done before itOh Tristram Tristram can
this but be once brought aboutthe credit which will attend thee as an
author shall counterbalance the many evils will have befallen thee as
a manthou wilt feast upon the onewhen thou hast lost all sense and
remembrance of the other

No wonder I itch so much as I do to get at these amoursThey are the
choicest morsel of my whole story and when I do get at emassure
yourselves good folksnor do I value whose squeamish stomach
takes offence at it I shall not be at all nice in the choice of my
wordsand thats the thing I have to declareI shall never get all
through in five minutes that I fearand the thing I hope is that your
worships and reverences are not offendedif you are depend upont Ill
give you something my good gentry next year to be offended atthats
my dear Jennys waybut who my Jenny isand which is the right and
which the wrong end of a woman is the thing to be concealedit
shall be told you in the next chapter but one to my chapter of
Buttonholesand not one chapter before

And now that you have just got to the end of these According to the
preceding Editions three volumesthe thing I have to ask is how you
feel your heads my own akes dismallyas for your healths I know
they are much betterTrue Shandeism think what you will against it
opens the heart and lungs and like all those affections which partake
of its nature it forces the blood and other vital fluids of the body
to run freely through its channels makes the wheel of life run long and
cheerfully round

Was I left like Sancho Panca to choose my kingdom it should not be
maritimeor a kingdom of blacks to make a penny ofno it should be
a kingdom of hearty laughing subjects And as the bilious and more
saturnine passions by creating disorders in the blood and humours have
as bad an influence I see upon the body politick as body naturaland
as nothing but a habit of virtue can fully govern those passions and
subject them to reasonI should add to my prayerthat God would give
my subjects grace to be as Wise as they were Merry and then should I be
the happiest monarch and they are the happiest people under heaven

And so with this moral for the present may it please your worships and
your reverences I take my leave of you till this time twelvemonth
when unless this vile cough kills me in the mean time Ill have
another pluck at your beards and lay open a story to the world you
little dream of

Chapter 3I

If it had not been for those two mettlesome tits and that madcap of
a postillion who drove them from Stilton to Stamford the thought had
never entered my head He flew like lightningthere was a slope of
three miles and a halfwe scarce touched the groundthe motion was
most rapidmost impetuoustwas communicated to my brainmy heart
partook of itBy the great God of day said I looking towards the
sun and thrusting my arm out of the forewindow of the chaise as I
made my vow I will lock up my studydoor the moment I get home and
throw the key of it ninety feet below the surface of the earth into the
drawwell at the back of my house

The London waggon confirmed me in my resolution it hung tottering
upon the hill scarce progressive dragddragd up by eight heavy
beastsby main strengthquoth I noddingbut your betters draw the
same wayand something of every bodysO rare

Tell me ye learned shall we for ever be adding so much to the bulkso
little to the stock

Shall we for ever make new books as apothecaries make new mixtures by
pouring only out of one vessel into another

Are we for ever to be twisting and untwisting the same rope for ever
in the same trackfor ever at the same pace

Shall we be destined to the days of eternity on holydays as well as
workingdays to be shewing the relicks of learning as monks do the
relicks of their saintswithout working oneone single miracle with
them

Who made Man with powers which dart him from earth to heaven in a
momentthat great that most excellent and most noble creature of the
worldthe miracle of nature as Zoroaster in his book Greek called
himthe Shekinah of the divine presence as Chrysostomthe image of
God as Mosesthe ray of divinity as Platothe marvel of marvels
as Aristotleto go sneaking on at this pitifulpimpingpettifogging
rate

I scorn to be as abusive as Horace upon the occasionbut if there is
no catachresis in the wish and no sin in it I wish from my soul that
every imitator in Great Britain France and Ireland had the farcy for
his pains and that there was a good farcical house large enough to
holdayeand sublimate them shag rag and bobtail male and female
all together and this leads me to the affair of Whiskersbut by what
chain of ideasI leave as a legacy in mortmain to Prudes and Tartufs
to enjoy and make the most of



Upon Whiskers

Im sorry I made ittwas as inconsiderate a promise as ever entered
a mans headA chapter upon whiskers alas the world will not
bear ittis a delicate worldbut I knew not of what mettle it was
madenor had I ever seen the underwritten fragment otherwise as
surely as noses are noses and whiskers are whiskers still let the
world say what it will to the contrary so surely would I have steered
clear of this dangerous chapter



The Fragment

You are half asleep my good lady said the old gentleman taking
hold of the old ladys hand and giving it a gentle squeeze as he
pronounced the word Whiskersshall we change the subject By no means
replied the old ladyI like your account of those matters so throwing
a thin gauze handkerchief over her head and leaning it back upon the
chair with her face turned towards him and advancing her two feet as
she reclined herselfI desire continued she you will go on

The old gentleman went on as followsWhiskers cried the queen
of Navarre dropping her knotting ball as La Fosseuse uttered the
wordWhiskers madam said La Fosseuse pinning the ball to the queens
apron and making a courtesy as she repeated it

La Fosseuses voice was naturally soft and low yet twas an articulate
voice and every letter of the word Whiskers fell distinctly upon the
queen of Navarres earWhiskers cried the queen laying a greater
stress upon the word and as if she had still distrusted her
earsWhiskers replied La Fosseuse repeating the word a third
timeThere is not a cavalier madam of his age in Navarre continued
the maid of honour pressing the pages interest upon the queen that
has so gallant a pairOf what cried Margaret smilingOf whiskers
said La Fosseuse with infinite modesty

The word Whiskers still stood its ground and continued to be made
use of in most of the best companies throughout the little kingdom of
Navarre notwithstanding the indiscreet use which La Fosseuse had made
of it the truth was La Fosseuse had pronounced the word not only
before the queen but upon sundry other occasions at court with an
accent which always implied something of a mysteryAnd as the court
of Margaret as all the world knows was at that time a mixture of
gallantry and devotionand whiskers being as applicable to the one as
the other the word naturally stood its groundit gained full as much
as it lost that is the clergy were for itthe laity were against
itand for the womenthey were divided

The excellency of the figure and mien of the young Sieur De Croix was
at that time beginning to draw the attention of the maids of honour
towards the terrace before the palace gate where the guard was mounted
The lady De Baussiere fell deeply in love with himLa Battarelle did
the sameit was the finest weather for it that ever was remembered
in NavarreLa Guyol La Maronette La Sabatiere fell in love with the
Sieur De Croix alsoLa Rebours and La Fosseuse knew betterDe Croix
had failed in an attempt to recommend himself to La Rebours and La
Rebours and La Fosseuse were inseparable

The queen of Navarre was sitting with her ladies in the painted
bowwindow facing the gate of the second court as De Croix passed
through itHe is handsome said the Lady BaussiereHe has a good mien
said La BattarelleHe is finely shaped said La GuyolI never saw an
officer of the horseguards in my life said La Maronette with two such
legsOr who stood so well upon them said La SabatiereBut he has no
whiskers cried La FosseuseNot a pile said La Rebours

The queen went directly to her oratory musing all the way as she
walked through the gallery upon the subject turning it this way and
that way in her fancyAve Mariawhat can LaFosseuse mean said she
kneeling down upon the cushion

La Guyol La Battarelle La Maronette La Sabatiere retired instantly
to their chambersWhiskers said all four of them to themselves as
they bolted their doors on the inside

The Lady Carnavallette was counting her beads with both hands
unsuspected under her farthingalfrom St Antony down to St Ursula
inclusive not a saint passed through her fingers without whiskers
St Francis St Dominick St Bennet St Basil St Bridget had all
whiskers

The Lady Baussiere had got into a wilderness of conceits with
moralizing too intricately upon La Fosseuses textShe mounted her
palfrey her page followed herthe host passed bythe Lady Baussiere
rode on

One denier cried the order of mercyone single denier in behalf of
a thousand patient captives whose eyes look towards heaven and you for
their redemption

The Lady Baussiere rode on

Pity the unhappy said a devout venerable hoaryheaded man meekly
holding up a box begirt with iron in his withered handsI beg for the
unfortunategood my Lady tis for a prisonfor an hospitaltis for
an old mana poor man undone by shipwreck by suretyship by fireI
call God and all his angels to witnesstis to clothe the nakedto
feed the hungrytis to comfort the sick and the brokenhearted

The Lady Baussiere rode on

A decayed kinsman bowed himself to the ground

The Lady Baussiere rode on

He ran begging bareheaded on one side of her palfrey conjuring her by
the former bonds of friendship alliance consanguinity cCousin
aunt sister motherfor virtues sake for your own for mine for
Christs sake remember mepity me

The Lady Baussiere rode on

Take hold of my whiskers said the Lady BaussiereThe page took hold of
her palfrey She dismounted at the end of the terrace

There are some trains of certain ideas which leave prints of themselves
about our eyes and eyebrows and there is a consciousness of it
somewhere about the heart which serves but to make these etchings the
strongerwe see spell and put them together without a dictionary

Ha ha he hee cried La Guyol and La Sabatiere looking close at each
others printsHo ho cried La Battarelle and Maronette doing
the sameWhist cried oneft ftsaid a secondhush quoth
a thirdpoo poo replied a fourthgramercy cried the Lady
Carnavallettetwas she who bewhiskerd St Bridget

La Fosseuse drew her bodkin from the knot of her hair and having traced
the outline of a small whisker with the blunt end of it upon one side
of her upper lip put in into La Rebours handLa Rebours shook her
head

The Lady Baussiere coughed thrice into the inside of her muffLa Guyol
smiledFy said the Lady Baussiere The queen of Navarre touched her
eye with the tip of her forefingeras much as to say I understand you
all

Twas plain to the whole court the word was ruined La Fosseuse had
given it a wound and it was not the better for passing through all
these defilesIt made a faint stand however for a few months by the
expiration of which the Sieur De Croix finding it high time to leave
Navarre for want of whiskersthe word in course became indecent and
after a few efforts absolutely unfit for use

The best word in the best language of the best world must have
suffered under such combinationsThe curate of dEstella wrote a book
against them setting forth the dangers of accessory ideas and warning
the Navarois against them

Does not all the world know said the curate dEstella at the conclusion
of his work that Noses ran the same fate some centuries ago in
most parts of Europe which Whiskers have now done in the kingdom of
NavarreThe evil indeed spread no farther thenbut have not beds
and bolsters and nightcaps and chamberpots stood upon the brink
of destruction ever since Are not trouse and placketholes and
pumphandlesand spigots and faucets in danger still from the same
associationChastity by nature the gentlest of all affectionsgive
it but its headtis like a ramping and a roaring lion

The drift of the curate dEstellas argument was not understoodThey
ran the scent the wrong wayThe world bridled his ass at the
tailAnd when the extremes of Delicacy and the beginnings of
Concupiscence hold their next provincial chapter together they may
decree that bawdy also



Chapter 3II

When my father received the letter which brought him the melancholy
account of my brother Bobbys death he was busy calculating the expence
of his riding post from Calais to Paris and so on to Lyons

Twas a most inauspicious journey my father having had every foot of it
to travel over again and his calculation to begin afresh when he had
almost got to the end of it by Obadiahs opening the door to acquaint
him the family was out of yeastand to ask whether he might not
take the great coachhorse early in the morning and ride in search
of someWith all my heart Obadiah said my father pursuing his
journeytake the coachhorse and welcomeBut he wants a shoe poor
creature said ObadiahPoor creature said my uncle Toby vibrating
the note back again like a string in unison Then ride the Scotch
horse quoth my father hastilyHe cannot bear a saddle upon his back
quoth Obadiah for the whole worldThe devils in that horse then
take Patriot cried my father and shut the doorPatriot is sold said
Obadiah Heres for you cried my father making a pause and looking
in my uncle Tobys face as if the thing had not been a matter
of factYour worship ordered me to sell him last April said
ObadiahThen go on foot for your pains cried my fatherI had much
rather walk than ride said Obadiah shutting the door

What plagues cried my father going on with his calculationBut the
waters are out said Obadiahopening the door again

Till that moment my father who had a map of Sansons and a book
of the postroads before him had kept his hand upon the head of his
compasses with one foot of them fixed upon Nevers the last stage he
had paid forpurposing to go on from that point with his journey and
calculation as soon as Obadiah quitted the room but this second attack
of Obadiahs in opening the door and laying the whole country under
water was too muchHe let go his compassesor rather with a mixed
motion between accident and anger he threw them upon the table and
then there was nothing for him to do but to return back to Calais like
many others as wise as he had set out

When the letter was brought into the parlour which contained the news
of my brothers death my father had got forwards again upon his
journey to within a stride of the compasses of the very same stage of
NeversBy your leave Mons Sanson cried my father striking the
point of his compasses through Nevers into the tableand nodding to
my uncle Toby to see what was in the lettertwice of one night is too
much for an English gentleman and his son Mons Sanson to be turned
back from so lousy a town as NeversWhat thinkst thou Toby added my
father in a sprightly toneUnless it be a garrison town said my uncle
Tobyfor thenI shall be a fool said my father smiling to himself
as long as I liveSo giving a second nodand keeping his compasses
still upon Nevers with one hand and holding his book of the postroads
in the otherhalf calculating and half listening he leaned forwards
upon the table with both elbows as my uncle Toby hummed over the
letter

hes gone said my uncle TobyWhereWho cried my fatherMy
nephew said my uncle TobyWhatwithout leavewithout moneywithout
governor cried my father in amazement Nohe is dead my dear
brother quoth my uncle TobyWithout being ill cried my father
againI dare say not said my uncle Toby in a low voice and fetching
a deep sigh from the bottom of his heart he has been ill enough poor
lad Ill answer for himfor he is dead

When Agrippina was told of her sons death Tacitus informs us that
not being able to moderate the violence of her passions she abruptly
broke off her workMy father stuck his compasses into Nevers but
so much the fasterWhat contrarieties his indeed was matter of
calculationAgrippinas must have been quite a different affair who
else could pretend to reason from history

How my father went on in my opinion deserves a chapter to itself



Chapter 3III

And a chapter it shall have and a devil of a one tooso look to
yourselves

Tis either Plato or Plutarch or Seneca or Xenophon or Epictetus
or Theophrastus or Lucianor some one perhaps of later dateeither
Cardan or Budaeus or Petrarch or Stellaor possibly it may be some
divine or father of the church St Austin or St Cyprian or Barnard
who affirms that it is an irresistible and natural passion to weep for
the loss of our friends or childrenand Seneca Im positive tells us
somewhere that such griefs evacuate themselves best by that particular
channelAnd accordingly we find that David wept for his son
AbsalomAdrian for his AntinousNiobe for her children and that
Apollodorus and Crito both shed tears for Socrates before his death

My father managed his affliction otherwise and indeed differently from
most men either ancient or modern for he neither wept it away as the
Hebrews and the Romansor slept it off as the Laplandersor hanged
it as the English or drowned it as the Germansnor did he curse it
or damn it or excommunicate it or rhyme it or lillabullero it

He got rid of it however

Will your worships give me leave to squeeze in a story between these two
pages

When Tully was bereft of his dear daughter Tullia at first he laid it
to his hearthe listened to the voice of nature and modulated his
own unto itO my Tullia my daughter my childstill still
stilltwas O my Tulliamy Tullia Methinks I see my Tullia I hear
my Tullia I talk with my TulliaBut as soon as he began to look into
the stores of philosophy and consider how many excellent things might
be said upon the occasionno body upon earth can conceive says the
great orator how happy how joyful it made me

My father was as proud of his eloquence as Marcus Tullius Cicero could
be for his life and for aught I am convinced of to the contrary
at present with as much reason it was indeed his strengthand his
weakness tooHis strengthfor he was by nature eloquent and his
weaknessfor he was hourly a dupe to it and provided an occasion
in life would but permit him to shew his talents or say either a
wise thing a witty or a shrewd onebating the case of a systematic
misfortunehe had all he wantedA blessing which tied up my fathers
tongue and a misfortune which let it loose with a good grace were
pretty equal sometimes indeed the misfortune was the better of the
two for instance where the pleasure of the harangue was as ten and
the pain of the misfortune but as fivemy father gained half in half
and consequently was as well again off as if it had never befallen him

This clue will unravel what otherwise would seem very inconsistent in my
fathers domestic character and it is this that in the provocations
arising from the neglects and blunders of servants or other mishaps
unavoidable in a family his anger or rather the duration of it
eternally ran counter to all conjecture

My father had a favourite little mare which he had consigned over to a
most beautiful Arabian horse in order to have a pad out of her for his
own riding he was sanguine in all his projects so talked about his
pad every day with as absolute a security as if it had been reared
brokeand bridled and saddled at his door ready for mounting By
some neglect or other in Obadiah it so fell out that my fathers
expectations were answered with nothing better than a mule and as ugly
a beast of the kind as ever was produced

My mother and my uncle Toby expected my father would be the death of
Obadiahand that there never would be an end of the disasterSee
here you rascal cried my father pointing to the mule what you have
doneIt was not me said ObadiahHow do I know that replied my
father

Triumph swam in my fathers eyes at the reparteethe Attic salt
brought water into themand so Obadiah heard no more about it

Now let us go back to my brothers death

Philosophy has a fine saying for every thingFor Death it has an
entire set the misery was they all at once rushed into my fathers
head that twas difficult to string them together so as to make any
thing of a consistent show out of themHe took them as they came

Tis an inevitable chancethe first statute in Magna Chartait is an
everlasting act of parliament my dear brotherAll must die

If my son could not have died it had been matter of wondernot that
he is dead

Monarchs and princes dance in the same ring with us

To die is the great debt and tribute due unto nature tombs and
monuments which should perpetuate our memories pay it themselves and
the proudest pyramid of them all which wealth and science have erected
has lost its apex and stands obtruncated in the travellers horizon
My father found he got great ease and went onKingdoms and
provinces and towns and cities have they not their periods and
when those principles and powers which at first cemented and put
them together have performed their several evolutions they fall
backBrother Shandy said my uncle Toby laying down his pipe at the
word evolutionsRevolutions I meant quoth my fatherby heaven
I meant revolutions brother Tobyevolutions is nonsenseTis not
nonsensesaid my uncle TobyBut is it not nonsense to break the
thread of such a discourse upon such an occasion cried my fatherdo
notdear Toby continued he taking him by the hand do notdo not I
beseech thee interrupt me at this crisisMy uncle Toby put his pipe
into his mouth

Where is Troy and Mycenae and Thebes and Delos and Persepolis and
Agrigentumcontinued my father taking up his book of postroads
which he had laid downWhat is become brother Toby of Nineveh and
Babylon of Cizicum and Mitylenae The fairest towns that ever the sun
rose upon are now no more the names only are left and those for many
of them are wrong spelt are falling themselves by piecemeals to decay
and in length of time will be forgotten and involved with every thing
in a perpetual night the world itself brother Toby mustmust come to
an end

Returning out of Asia when I sailed from Aegina towards Megara when
can this have been thought my uncle Toby I began to view the country
round about Aegina was behind me Megara was before Pyraeus on the
right hand Corinth on the leftWhat flourishing towns now prostrate
upon the earth Alas alas said I to myself that man should disturb
his soul for the loss of a child when so much as this lies awfully
buried in his presenceRemember said I to myself againremember thou
art a man

Now my uncle Toby knew not that this last paragraph was an extract
of Servius Sulpiciuss consolatory letter to TullyHe had as little
skill honest man in the fragments as he had in the whole pieces of
antiquityAnd as my father whilst he was concerned in the Turkey
trade had been three or four different times in the Levant in one
of which he had stayed a whole year and an half at Zant my uncle Toby
naturally concluded that in some one of these periods he had taken a
trip across the Archipelago into Asia and that all this sailing affair
with Aegina behind and Megara before and Pyraeus on the right hand
c c was nothing more than the true course of my fathers voyage and
reflectionsTwas certainly in his manner and many an undertaking
critic would have built two stories higher upon worse foundationsAnd
pray brother quoth my uncle Toby laying the end of his pipe upon
my fathers hand in a kindly way of interruptionbut waiting till he
finished the accountwhat year of our Lord was thisTwas no year
of our Lord replied my fatherThats impossible cried my uncle
TobySimpleton said my fathertwas forty years before Christ was
born

My uncle Toby had but two things for it either to suppose his brother
to be the wandering Jew or that his misfortunes had disordered his
brainMay the Lord God of heaven and earth protect him and restore
him said my uncle Toby praying silently for my father and with tears
in his eyes

My father placed the tears to a proper account and went on with his
harangue with great spirit

There is not such great odds brother Toby betwixt good and evil
as the world imaginesthis way of setting off by the bye was not
likely to cure my uncle Tobys suspicionsLabour sorrow grief
sickness want and woe are the sauces of lifeMuch good may do
themsaid my uncle Toby to himself

My son is deadso much the bettertis a shame in such a tempest to
have but one anchor

But he is gone for ever from usbe it so He is got from under the
hands of his barber before he was baldhe is but risen from a feast
before he was surfeitedfrom a banquet before he had got drunken

The Thracians wept when a child was bornand we were very near it
quoth my uncle Tobyand feasted and made merry when a man went out
of the world and with reasonDeath opens the gate of fame and shuts
the gate of envy after itit unlooses the chain of the captive and
puts the bondsmans task into another mans hands

Shew me the man who knows what life is who dreads it and Ill shew
thee a prisoner who dreads his liberty

Is it not better my dear brother Toby for markour appetites are but
diseasesis it not better not to hunger at all than to eatnot to
thirst than to take physic to cure it

Is it not better to be freed from cares and agues from love and
melancholy and the other hot and cold fits of life than like a galled
traveller who comes weary to his inn to be bound to begin his journey
afresh

There is no terrour brother Toby in its looks but what it borrows
from groans and convulsionsand the blowing of noses and the
wiping away of tears with the bottoms of curtains in a dying mans
roomStrip it of these what is itTis better in battle than in
bed said my uncle TobyTake away its hearses its mutes and its
mourningits plumes scutcheons and other mechanic aidsWhat
is itBetter in battle continued my father smiling for he had
absolutely forgot my brother Bobbytis terrible no wayfor consider
brother Tobywhen we aredeath is notand when death iswe are
not My uncle Toby laid down his pipe to consider the proposition my
fathers eloquence was too rapid to stay for any manaway it wentand
hurried my uncle Tobys ideas along with it

For this reason continued my father tis worthy to recollect
how little alteration in great men the approaches of death have
madeVespasian died in a jest upon his closestoolGalba with a
sentenceSeptimus Severus in a dispatchTiberius in dissimulation and
Caesar Augustus in a complimentI hope twas a sincere onequoth my
uncle Toby

Twas to his wifesaid my father



Chapter 3IV

And lastlyfor all the choice anecdotes which history can produce
of this matter continued my fatherthis like the gilded dome which
covers in the fabriccrowns all

Tis of Cornelius Gallus the praetorwhich I dare say brother Toby
you have readI dare say I have not replied my uncleHe died said
my father asAnd if it was with his wife said my uncle Tobythere
could be no hurt in itThats more than I knowreplied my father



Chapter 3V

My mother was going very gingerly in the dark along the passage which
led to the parlour as my uncle Toby pronounced the word wifeTis a
shrill penetrating sound of itself and Obadiah had helped it by leaving
the door a little ajar so that my mother heard enough of it to imagine
herself the subject of the conversation so laying the edge of her
finger across her two lipsholding in her breath and bending her head
a little downwards with a twist of her necknot towards the door but
from it by which means her ear was brought to the chinkshe listened
with all her powersthe listening slave with the Goddess of Silence
at his back could not have given a finer thought for an intaglio

In this attitude I am determined to let her stand for five minutes
till I bring up the affairs of the kitchen as Rapin does those of the
church to the same period



Chapter 3VI

Though in one sense our family was certainly a simple machine as it
consisted of a few wheels yet there was thus much to be said for it
that these wheels were set in motion by so many different springs and
acted one upon the other from such a variety of strange principles and
impulsesthat though it was a simple machine it had all the honour and
advantages of a complex oneand a number of as odd movements within
it as ever were beheld in the inside of a Dutch silkmill

Amongst these there was one I am going to speak of in which perhaps
it was not altogether so singular as in many others and it was
this that whatever motion debate harangue dialogue project or
dissertation was going forwards in the parlour there was generally
another at the same time and upon the same subject running parallel
along with it in the kitchen

Now to bring this about whenever an extraordinary message or letter
was delivered in the parlouror a discourse suspended till a servant
went outor the lines of discontent were observed to hang upon the
brows of my father or motheror in short when any thing was supposed
to be upon the tapis worth knowing or listening to twas the rule to
leave the door not absolutely shut but somewhat ajaras it stands
just nowwhich under covert of the bad hinge and that possibly
might be one of the many reasons why it was never mended it was not
difficult to manage by which means in all these cases a passage was
generally left not indeed as wide as the Dardanelles but wide enough
for all that to carry on as much of this windward trade as was
sufficient to save my father the trouble of governing his housemy
mother at this moment stands profiting by itObadiah did the same
thing as soon as he had left the letter upon the table which brought
the news of my brothers death so that before my father had well got
over his surprise and entered upon his haranguehad Trim got upon his
legs to speak his sentiments upon the subject

A curious observer of nature had he been worth the inventory of all
Jobs stockthough by the bye your curious observers are seldom worth
a groatwould have given the half of it to have heard Corporal Trim
and my father two orators so contrasted by nature and education
haranguing over the same bier

My fathera man of deep readingprompt memorywith Cato and Seneca
and Epictetus at his fingers ends

The corporalwith nothingto rememberof no deeper reading than his
musterrollor greater names at his fingers end than the contents of
it

The one proceeding from period to period by metaphor and allusion and
striking the fancy as he went along as men of wit and fancy do with
the entertainment and pleasantry of his pictures and images

The other without wit or antithesis or point or turn this way or
that but leaving the images on one side and the picture on the other
going straight forwards as nature could lead him to the heart O Trim
would to heaven thou hadst a better historianwouldthy historian
had a better pair of breechesO ye critics will nothing melt you



Chapter 3VII

My young master in London is dead said Obadiah

A green sattin nightgown of my mothers which had been twice
scoured was the first idea which Obadiahs exclamation brought
into Susannahs headWell might Locke write a chapter upon the
imperfections of wordsThen quoth Susannah we must all go into
mourningBut note a second time the word mourning notwithstanding
Susannah made use of it herselffailed also of doing its office it
excited not one single idea tinged either with grey or blackall was
greenThe green sattin nightgown hung there still

O twill be the death of my poor mistress cried SusannahMy
mothers whole wardrobe followedWhat a procession her red
damaskher orange tawneyher white and yellow lutestringsher
brown taffataher bonelaced caps her bedgowns and comfortable
underpetticoatsNot a rag was left behindNoshe will never look
up again said Susannah

We had a fat foolish scullionmy father I think kept her for her
simplicityshe had been all autumn struggling with a dropsyHe
is dead said Obadiahhe is certainly deadSo am not I said the
foolish scullion

Here is sad news Trim cried Susannah wiping her eyes as Trim
steppd into the kitchenmaster Bobby is dead and buriedthe funeral
was an interpolation of Susannahswe shall have all to go into
mourning said Susannah

I hope not said TrimYou hope not cried Susannah earnestlyThe
mourning ran not in Trims head whatever it did in SusannahsI
hopesaid Trim explaining himself I hope in God the news is not true
I heard the letter read with my own ears answered Obadiah and we shall
have a terrible piece of work of it in stubbing the oxmoorOh hes
dead said SusannahAs sure said the scullion as Im alive

I lament for him from my heart and my soul said Trim fetching a
sighPoor creaturepoor boypoor gentleman

He was alive last Whitsontide said the coachmanWhitsontide alas
cried Trim extending his right arm and falling instantly into the same
attitude in which he read the sermonwhat is Whitsontide Jonathan
for that was the coachmans name or Shrovetide or any tide or time
past to this Are we not here now continued the corporal striking the
end of his stick perpendicularly upon the floor so as to give an idea
of health and stabilityand are we notdropping his hat upon the
ground gone in a momentTwas infinitely striking Susannah burst
into a flood of tearsWe are not stocks and stonesJonathan
Obadiah the cookmaid all meltedThe foolish fat scullion herself
who was scouring a fishkettle upon her knees was rousd with itThe
whole kitchen crowded about the corporal

Now as I perceive plainly that the preservation of our constitution in
church and stateand possibly the preservation of the whole worldor
what is the same thing the distribution and balance of its property and
power may in time to come depend greatly upon the right understanding
of this stroke of the corporals eloquenceI do demand your
attentionyour worships and reverences for any ten pages together
take them where you will in any other part of the work shall sleep for
it at your ease

I said we were not stocks and stonestis very well I should have
added nor are we angels I wish we werebut men clothed with bodies
and governed by our imaginationsand what a junketing piece of work
of it there is betwixt these and our seven senses especially some of
them for my own part I own it I am ashamed to confess Let it suffice
to affirm that of all the senses the eye for I absolutely deny the
touch though most of your Barbati I know are for it has the quickest
commerce with the soulgives a smarter stroke and leaves something
more inexpressible upon the fancy than words can either conveyor
sometimes get rid of

Ive gone a little aboutno matter tis for healthlet us only
carry it back in our mind to the mortality of Trims hatAre we
not here nowand gone in a momentThere was nothing in the
sentencetwas one of your selfevident truths we have the advantage of
hearing every day and if Trim had not trusted more to his hat than his
headhe made nothing at all of it

Are we not here now continued the corporal and are we
notdropping his hat plumb upon the groundand pausing before he
pronounced the wordgone in a moment The descent of the hat was as
if a heavy lump of clay had been kneaded into the crown of itNothing
could have expressed the sentiment of mortality of which it was the
type and forerunner like ithis hand seemed to vanish from under
itit fell deadthe corporals eye fixed upon it as upon a
corpseand Susannah burst into a flood of tears

NowTen thousand and ten thousand times ten thousand for matter and
motion are infinite are the ways by which a hat may be dropped upon the
ground without any effectHad he flung it or thrown it or cast it
or skimmed it or squirted it or let it slip or fall in any possible
direction under heavenor in the best direction that could be given
to ithad he dropped it like a gooselike a puppylike an assor in
doing it or even after he had done had he looked like a foollike a
ninnylike a nincompoopit had faild and the effect upon the heart
had been lost

Ye who govern this mighty world and its mighty concerns with the engines
of eloquencewho heat it and cool it and melt it and mollify
itand then harden it again to your purpose

Ye who wind and turn the passions with this great windlass and having
done it lead the owners of them whither ye think meet

Ye lastly who driveand why not Ye also who are driven like turkeys
to market with a stick and a red cloutmeditatemeditate I beseech
you upon Trims hat



Chapter 3VIII

StayI have a small account to settle with the reader before Trim can
go on with his harangueIt shall be done in two minutes

Amongst many other bookdebts all of which I shall discharge in due
timeI own myself a debtor to the world for two itemsa chapter upon
chambermaids and buttonholes which in the former part of my work
I promised and fully intended to pay off this year but some of your
worships and reverences telling me that the two subjects especially so
connected together might endanger the morals of the worldI pray the
chapter upon chambermaids and buttonholes may be forgiven meand
that they will accept of the last chapter in lieu of it which is
nothing ant please your reverences but a chapter of chambermaids
green gowns and old hats

Trim took his hat off the groundput it upon his headand then went
on with his oration upon death in manner and form following



Chapter 3IX

To us Jonathan who know not what want or care iswho live here in
the service of two of the best of mastersbating in my own case his
majesty King William the Third whom I had the honour to serve both in
Ireland and FlandersI own it that from Whitsontide to within three
weeks of Christmastis not longtis like nothingbut to those
Jonathan who know what death is and what havock and destruction he
can make before a man can well wheel abouttis like a whole ageO
Jonathan twould make a goodnatured mans heart bleed to consider
continued the corporal standing perpendicularly how low many a brave
and upright fellow has been laid since that timeAnd trust me Susy
added the corporal turning to Susannah whose eyes were swimming in
waterbefore that time comes round againmany a bright eye will be
dimSusannah placed it to the right side of the pageshe weptbut
she courtsied tooAre we not continued Trim looking still at
Susannahare we not like a flower of the fielda tear of pride stole
in betwixt every two tears of humiliationelse no tongue could
have described Susannahs afflictionis not all flesh grassTis
claytis dirtThey all looked directly at the scullionthe
scullion had just been scouring a fishkettleIt was not fair

What is the finest face that ever man looked atI could hear Trim
talk so for ever cried Susannahwhat is it Susannah laid her hand
upon Trims shoulderbut corruptionSusannah took it off

Now I love you for thisand tis this delicious mixture within you
which makes you dear creatures what you areand he who hates you for
itall I can say of the matter isThat he has either a pumpkin for his
heador a pippin for his heartand whenever he is dissected twill be
found so



Chapter 3X

Whether Susannah by taking her hand too suddenly from off the
corporals shoulder by the whisking about of her passionsbroke a
little the chain of his reflexions

Or whether the corporal began to be suspicious he had got into the
doctors quarters and was talking more like the chaplain than himself

Or whetherOr whetherfor in all such cases a man of invention and
parts may with pleasure fill a couple of pages with suppositionswhich
of all these was the cause let the curious physiologist or the curious
any body determinetis certain at least the corporal went on thus
with his harangue

For my own part I declare it that out of doors I value not death at
allnot thisadded the corporal snapping his fingersbut with an
air which no one but the corporal could have given to the sentimentIn
battle I value death not thisand let him not take me cowardly
like poor Joe Gibbins in scouring his gunWhat is he A pull of
a triggera push of a bayonet an inch this way or thatmakes the
differenceLook along the lineto the rightsee Jacks down
welltis worth a regiment of horse to himNotis Dick Then
Jacks no worseNever mind whichwe pass onin hot pursuit the
wound itself which brings him is not feltthe best way is to stand up
to himthe man who flies is in ten times more danger than the man
who marches up into his jawsIve lookd him added the corporal an
hundred times in the faceand know what he isHes nothing
Obadiah at all in the fieldBut hes very frightful in a house quoth
ObadiahI never mind it myself said Jonathan upon a coachboxIt
must in my opinion be most natural in bed replied SusannahAnd
could I escape him by creeping into the worst calfs skin that ever
was made into a knapsack I would do it theresaid Trimbut that is
nature

Nature is nature said JonathanAnd that is the reason cried
Susannah I so much pity my mistressShe will never get the better of
itNow I pity the captain the most of any one in the family answered
TrimMadam will get ease of heart in weepingand the Squire in
talking about itbut my poor master will keep it all in silence to
himselfI shall hear him sigh in his bed for a whole month together
as he did for lieutenant Le Fever An please your honour do not sigh
so piteously I would say to him as I laid besides him I cannot help
it Trim my master would saytis so melancholy an accidentI cannot
get it off my heartYour honour fears not death yourselfI hope
Trim I fear nothing he would say but the doing a wrong thingWell
he would add whatever betides I will take care of Le Fevers boyAnd
with that like a quieting draught his honour would fall asleep

I like to hear Trims stories about the captain said SusannahHe is
a kindlyhearted gentleman said Obadiah as ever livedAye and
as brave a one too said the corporal as ever stept before a
platoonThere never was a better officer in the kings armyor
a better man in Gods world for he would march up to the mouth of a
cannon though he saw the lighted match at the very touchholeand
yet for all that he has a heart as soft as a child for other
peopleHe would not hurt a chickenI would sooner quoth Jonathan
drive such a gentleman for seven pounds a yearthan some for
eightThank thee Jonathan for thy twenty shillingsas much
Jonathan said the corporal shaking him by the hand as if thou hadst
put the money into my own pocketI would serve him to the day of my
death out of love He is a friend and a brother to meand could I be
sure my poor brother Tom was deadcontinued the corporal taking out
his handkerchiefwas I worth ten thousand pounds I would leave every
shilling of it to the captainTrim could not refrain from tears at
this testamentary proof he gave of his affection to his masterThe
whole kitchen was affectedDo tell us the story of the poor
lieutenant said SusannahWith all my heart answered the corporal

Susannah the cook Jonathan Obadiah and corporal Trim formed a
circle about the fire and as soon as the scullion had shut the kitchen
doorthe corporal begun



Chapter 3XI

I am a Turk if I had not as much forgot my mother as if Nature had
plaistered me up and set me down naked upon the banks of the river
Nile without oneYour most obedient servant MadamIve cost you a
great deal of troubleI wish it may answerbut you have left a crack
in my backand heres a great piece fallen off here beforeand what
must I do with this footI shall never reach England with it

For my own part I never wonder at any thingand so often has my
judgment deceived me in my life that I always suspect it right or
wrongat least I am seldom hot upon cold subjects For all this I
reverence truth as much as any body and when it has slipped us if a
man will but take me by the hand and go quietly and search for it
as for a thing we have both lost and can neither of us do
well withoutIll go to the worlds end with himBut I hate
disputesand therefore bating religious points or such as touch
society I would almost subscribe to any thing which does not choak me
in the first passage rather than be drawn into oneBut I cannot
bear suffocationand bad smells worst of allFor which reasons I
resolved from the beginning That if ever the army of martyrs was to be
augmentedor a new one raisedI would have no hand in it one way or
tother



Chapter 3XII

But to return to my mother

My uncle Tobys opinion Madam that there could be no harm in
Cornelius Gallus the Roman praetors lying with his wifeor rather
the last word of that opinionfor it was all my mother heard of it
caught hold of her by the weak part of the whole sexYou shall not
mistake meI mean her curiosityshe instantly concluded herself the
subject of the conversation and with that prepossession upon her fancy
you will readily conceive every word my father said was accommodated
either to herself or her family concerns

Pray Madam in what street does the lady live who would not have
done the same

From the strange mode of Corneliuss death my father had made a
transition to that of Socrates and was giving my uncle Toby an abstract
of his pleading before his judgestwas irresistiblenot the oration
of Socratesbut my fathers temptation to itHe had wrote the Life
of Socrates This book my father would never consent to publish tis in
manuscript with some other tracts of his in the family all or most
of which will be printed in due time himself the year before he left
off trade which I fear was the means of hastening him out of itso
that no one was able to set out with so full a sail and in so swelling
a tide of heroic loftiness upon the occasion as my father was Not
a period in Socratess oration which closed with a shorter word than
transmigration or annihilationor a worse thought in the middle of it
than to beor not to bethe entering upon a new and untried state of
thingsor upon a long a profound and peaceful sleep without dreams
without disturbanceThat we and our children were born to diebut
neither of us born to be slavesNothere I mistake that was part of
Eleazers oration as recorded by Josephus de Bell JudaicEleazer
owns he had it from the philosophers of India in all likelihood
Alexander the Great in his irruption into India after he had overrun
Persia amongst the many things he stolestole that sentiment also
by which means it was carried if not all the way by himself for we
all know he died at Babylon at least by some of his maroders into
Greecefrom Greece it got to Romefrom Rome to Franceand from
France to EnglandSo things come round

By land carriage I can conceive no other way

By water the sentiment might easily have come down the Ganges into the
Sinus Gangeticus or Bay of Bengal and so into the Indian Sea and
following the course of trade the way from India by the Cape of Good
Hope being then unknown might be carried with other drugs and spices
up the Red Sea to Joddah the port of Mekka or else to Tor or Sues
towns at the bottom of the gulf and from thence by karrawans to Coptos
but three days journey distant so down the Nile directly to Alexandria
where the Sentiment would be landed at the very foot of the great
staircase of the Alexandrian libraryand from that storehouse it
would be fetchedBless me what a trade was driven by the learned in
those days



Chapter 3XIII

Now my father had a way a little like that of Jobs in case there
ever was such a manif not theres an end of the matter

Though by the bye because your learned men find some difficulty in
fixing the precise aera in which so great a man livedwhether for
instance before or after the patriarchs cto vote therefore that
he never lived at all is a little crueltis not doing as they would
be done byhappen that as it mayMy father I say had a way when
things went extremely wrong with him especially upon the first sally
of his impatienceof wondering why he was begotwishing himself
deadsometimes worseAnd when the provocation ran high and grief
touched his lips with more than ordinary powersSir you scarce could
have distinguished him from Socrates himselfEvery word would breathe
the sentiments of a soul disdaining life and careless about all its
issues for which reason though my mother was a woman of no deep
reading yet the abstract of Socratess oration which my father was
giving my uncle Toby was not altogether new to herShe listened to
it with composed intelligence and would have done so to the end of the
chapter had not my father plunged which he had no occasion to have
done into that part of the pleading where the great philosopher
reckons up his connections his alliances and children but renounces
a security to be so won by working upon the passions of his judgesI
have friendsI have relationsI have three desolate childrensays
Socrates

Then cried my mother opening the dooryou have one more Mr
Shandy than I know of

By heaven I have one lesssaid my father getting up and walking out
of the room



Chapter 3XIV

They are Socratess children said my uncle Toby He has been dead a
hundred years ago replied my mother

My uncle Toby was no chronologerso not caring to advance one step but
upon safe ground he laid down his pipe deliberately upon the table and
rising up and taking my mother most kindly by the hand without saying
another word either good or bad to her he led her out after my
father that he might finish the ecclaircissement himself



Chapter 3XV

Had this volume been a farce which unless every ones life and
opinions are to be looked upon as a farce as well as mine I see no
reason to supposethe last chapter Sir had finished the first act of

Chapter 3XVI

The first thing which entered my fathers head after affairs were
a little settled in the family and Susanna had got possession of my
mothers green sattin nightgownwas to sit down coolly after the
example of Xenophon and write a Tristrapaedia or system of education
for me collecting first for that purpose his own scattered thoughts
counsels and notions and binding them together so as to form an
Institute for the government of my childhood and adolescence I was
my fathers last stakehe had lost my brother Bobby entirelyhe had
lost by his own computation full threefourths of methat is he had
been unfortunate in his three first great casts for memy geniture
nose and namethere was but this one left and accordingly my father
gave himself up to it with as much devotion as ever my uncle Toby had
done to his doctrine of projectilsThe difference between them was
that my uncle Toby drew his whole knowledge of projectils from Nicholas
TartagliaMy father spun his every thread of it out of his own
brainor reeled and crosstwisted what all other spinners and
spinsters had spun before him that twas pretty near the same torture
to him

In about three years or something more my father had got advanced
almost into the middle of his workLike all other writers he met with
disappointmentsHe imagined he should be able to bring whatever he had
to say into so small a compass that when it was finished and bound
it might be rolled up in my mothers hussiveMatter grows under our
handsLet no man sayComeIll write a duodecimo

My father gave himself up to it however with the most painful
diligence proceeding step by step in every line with the same kind of
caution and circumspection though I cannot say upon quite so religious
a principle as was used by John de la Casse the lord archbishop of
Benevento in compassing his Galatea in which his Grace of Benevento
spent near forty years of his life and when the thing came out it was
not of above half the size or the thickness of a Riders AlmanackHow
the holy man managed the affair unless he spent the greatest part
of his time in combing his whiskers or playing at primero with his
chaplainwould pose any mortal not let into the true secretand
therefore tis worth explaining to the world was it only for the
encouragement of those few in it who write not so much to be fedas to
be famous

I own had John de la Casse the archbishop of Benevento for
whose memory notwithstanding his Galatea I retain the highest
venerationhad he been Sir a slender clerkof dull witslow
partscostive head and so forthhe and his Galatea might have jogged
on together to the age of Methuselah for methe phaenomenon had not
been worth a parenthesis

But the reverse of this was the truth John de la Casse was a genius of
fine parts and fertile fancy and yet with all these great advantages of
nature which should have pricked him forwards with his Galatea he lay
under an impuissance at the same time of advancing above a line and
a half in the compass of a whole summers day this disability in his
Grace arose from an opinion he was afflicted withwhich opinion was
thisviz that whenever a Christian was writing a book not for his
private amusement but where his intent and purpose was bona fide to
print and publish it to the world his first thoughts were always the
temptations of the evil oneThis was the state of ordinary writers
but when a personage of venerable character and high station either in
church or state once turned authorhe maintained that from the very
moment he took pen in handall the devils in hell broke out of their
holes to cajole himTwas Termtime with themevery thought first
and last was captioushow specious and good soevertwas
all onein whatever form or colour it presented itself to the
imaginationtwas still a stroke of one or other of em levelld at
him and was to be fenced offSo that the life of a writer whatever
he might fancy to the contrary was not so much a state of composition
as a state of warfare and his probation in it precisely that of any
other man militant upon earthboth depending alike not half so much
upon the degrees of his witas his Resistance

My father was hugely pleased with this theory of John de la Casse
archbishop of Benevento and had it not cramped him a little in his
creed I believe would have given ten of the best acres in the Shandy
estate to have been the broacher of itHow far my father actually
believed in the devil will be seen when I come to speak of my fathers
religious notions in the progress of this work tis enough to say
here as he could not have the honour of it in the literal sense of
the doctrinehe took up with the allegory of it and would often say
especially when his pen was a little retrograde there was as much good
meaning truth and knowledge couched under the veil of John de la
Casses parabolical representationas was to be found in any one
poetic fiction or mystic record of antiquityPrejudice of education
he would say is the deviland the multitudes of them which we suck
in with our mothers milkare the devil and allWe are haunted with
them brother Toby in all our lucubrations and researches and was a
man fool enough to submit tamely to what they obtruded upon himwhat
would his book be Nothinghe would add throwing his pen away with
a vengeancenothing but a farrago of the clack of nurses and of the
nonsense of the old women of both sexes throughout the kingdom

This is the best account I am determined to give of the slow progress
my father made in his Tristrapaedia at which as I said he was three
years and something more indefatigably at work and at last had
scarce completed by this own reckoning one half of his undertaking
the misfortune was that I was all that time totally neglected and
abandoned to my mother and what was almost as bad by the very delay
the first part of the work upon which my father had spent the most
of his pains was rendered entirely uselessevery day a page or two
became of no consequence

Certainly it was ordained as a scourge upon the pride of human wisdom
That the wisest of us all should thus outwit ourselves and eternally
forego our purposes in the intemperate act of pursuing them

In short my father was so long in all his acts of resistanceor in
other wordshe advanced so very slow with his work and I began
to live and get forwards at such a rate that if an event had not
happenedwhich when we get to it if it can be told with decency
shall not be concealed a moment from the readerI verily believe I had
put by my father and left him drawing a sundial for no better purpose
than to be buried under ground



Chapter 3XVII

Twas nothingI did not lose two drops of blood by ittwas not
worth calling in a surgeon had he lived next door to usthousands
suffer by choice what I did by accidentDoctor Slop made ten times
more of it than there was occasionsome men rise by the art of
hanging great weights upon small wiresand I am this day August
the 10th 1761 paying part of the price of this mans reputationO
twould provoke a stone to see how things are carried on in this
worldThe chambermaid had left no  under the bedCannot
you contrive master quoth Susannah lifting up the sash with one
hand as she spoke and helping me up into the windowseat with
the othercannot you manage my dear for a single time
to

I was five years oldSusannah did not consider that nothing was well
hung in our familyso slap came the sash down like lightning upon
usNothing is leftcried Susannahnothing is leftfor me but to
run my countryMy uncle Tobys house was a much kinder sanctuary and
so Susannah fled to it



Chapter 3XVIII

When Susannah told the corporal the misadventure of the sash with
all the circumstances which attended the murder of meas she called
itthe blood forsook his cheeksall accessaries in murder being
principalsTrims conscience told him he was as much to blame as
Susannahand if the doctrine had been true my uncle Toby had as much
of the bloodshed to answer for to heaven as either of emso that
neither reason or instinct separate or together could possibly have
guided Susannahs steps to so proper an asylum It is in vain to leave
this to the Readers imaginationto form any kind of hypothesis that
will render these propositions feasible he must cudgel his brains
soreand to do it withouthe must have such brains as no reader ever
had before himWhy should I put them either to trial or to torture
Tis my own affair Ill explain it myself



Chapter 3XIX

Tis a pity Trim said my uncle Toby resting with his hand upon the
corporals shoulder as they both stood surveying their worksthat
we have not a couple of fieldpieces to mount in the gorge of that new
redoubttwould secure the lines all along there and make the attack
on that side quite completeget me a couple cast Trim

Your honour shall have them replied Trim before tomorrow morning

It was the joy of Trims heart nor was his fertile head ever at a loss
for expedients in doing it to supply my uncle Toby in his campaigns
with whatever his fancy called for had it been his last crown he would
have sate down and hammered it into a paderero to have prevented a
single wish in his master The corporal had alreadywhat with cutting
off the ends of my uncle Tobys spoutshacking and chiseling up
the sides of his leaden guttersmelting down his pewter
shavingbasonand going at last like Lewis the Fourteenth on to
the top of the church for spare ends che had that very campaign
brought no less than eight new battering cannons besides three
demiculverins into the field my uncle Tobys demand for two more
pieces for the redoubt had set the corporal at work again and no
better resource offering he had taken the two leaden weights from the
nursery window and as the sash pullies when the lead was gone were of
no kind of use he had taken them away also to make a couple of wheels
for one of their carriages

He had dismantled every sashwindow in my uncle Tobys house long
before in the very same waythough not always in the same order for
sometimes the pullies have been wanted and not the leadso then he
began with the pulliesand the pullies being picked out then the lead
became uselessand so the lead went to pot too

A great Moral might be picked handsomely out of this but I have not
timetis enough to say wherever the demolition began twas equally
fatal to the sash window



Chapter 3XX

The corporal had not taken his measures so badly in this stroke of
artilleryship but that he might have kept the matter entirely to
himself and left Susannah to have sustained the whole weight of the
attack as she couldtrue courage is not content with coming
off soThe corporal whether as general or comptroller of the
traintwas no matterhad done that without which as he imagined
the misfortune could never have happenedat least in Susannahs
handsHow would your honours have behavedHe determined at once
not to take shelter behind Susannahbut to give it and with this
resolution upon his mind he marched upright into the parlour to lay
the whole manoeuvre before my uncle Toby

My uncle Toby had just then been giving Yorick an account of the Battle
of Steenkirk and of the strange conduct of count Solmes in ordering the
foot to halt and the horse to march where it could not act which was
directly contrary to the kings commands and proved the loss of the
day

There are incidents in some families so pat to the purpose of what
is going to followthey are scarce exceeded by the invention of a
dramatic writerI mean of ancient days

Trim by the help of his forefinger laid flat upon the table and the
edge of his hand striking across it at right angles made a shift to
tell his story so that priests and virgins might have listened to
itand the story being toldthe dialogue went on as follows



Chapter 3XXI

I would be picquetted to death cried the corporal as he concluded
Susannahs story before I would suffer the woman to come to any
harmtwas my fault an please your honournot hers

Corporal Trim replied my uncle Toby putting on his hat which lay upon
the tableif any thing can be said to be a fault when the service
absolutely requires it should be donetis I certainly who deserve the
blameyou obeyed your orders

Had count Solmes Trim done the same at the battle of Steenkirk said
Yorick drolling a little upon the corporal who had been run over by
a dragoon in the retreathe had saved theeSaved cried Trim
interrupting Yorick and finishing the sentence for him after his own
fashionhe had saved five battalions an please your reverence every
soul of themthere was Cuttscontinued the corporal clapping the
forefinger of his right hand upon the thumb of his left and counting
round his handthere was CuttsMackaysAngussGrahamsand
Levens all cut to piecesand so had the English lifeguards too had
it not been for some regiments upon the right who marched up boldly to
their relief and received the enemys fire in their faces before any
one of their own platoons discharged a muskettheyll go to heaven
for itadded TrimTrim is right said my uncle Toby nodding to
Yorickhes perfectly right What signified his marching the horse
continued the corporal where the ground was so strait that the French
had such a nation of hedges and copses and ditches and felld trees
laid this way and that to cover them as they always haveCount
Solmes should have sent uswe would have fired muzzle to muzzle with
them for their livesThere was nothing to be done for the horsehe
had his foot shot off however for his pains continued the corporal the
very next campaign at LandenPoor Trim got his wound there quoth
my uncle TobyTwas owing an please your honour entirely to count
Solmeshad he drubbed them soundly at Steenkirk they would not have
fought us at LandenPossibly notTrim said my uncle Tobythough
if they have the advantage of a wood or you give them a moments time
to intrench themselves they are a nation which will pop and pop for
ever at youThere is no way but to march coolly up to themreceive
their fire and fall in upon them pellmellDing dong added
TrimHorse and foot said my uncle TobyHelter Skelter said
TrimRight and left cried my uncle TobyBlood an ounds shouted
the corporalthe battle ragedYorick drew his chair a little to one
side for safety and after a moments pause my uncle Toby sinking his
voice a noteresumed the discourse as follows



Chapter 3XXII

King William said my uncle Toby addressing himself to Yorick was so
terribly provoked at count Solmes for disobeying his orders that he
would not suffer him to come into his presence for many months afterI
fear answered Yorick the squire will be as much provoked at the
corporal as the King at the countBut twould be singularly hard
in this case continued be if corporal Trim who has behaved so
diametrically opposite to count Solmes should have the fate to be
rewarded with the same disgracetoo oft in this world do things take
that trainI would spring a mine cried my uncle Toby rising upand
blow up my fortifications and my house with them and we would perish
under their ruins ere I would stand by and see itTrim directed a
slightbut a grateful bow towards his masterand so the chapter
ends



Chapter 3XXIII

Then Yorick replied my uncle Toby you and I will lead the way
abreastand do you corporal follow a few paces behind usAnd
Susannah an please your honour said Trim shall be put in the
rearTwas an excellent dispositionand in this order without
either drums beating or colours flying they marched slowly from my
uncle Tobys house to Shandyhall

I wish said Trim as they entered the doorinstead of the sash
weights I had cut off the church spout as I once thought to have
doneYou have cut off spouts enow replied Yorick



Chapter 3XXIV

As many pictures as have been given of my father how like him soever
in different airs and attitudesnot one or all of them can ever help
the reader to any kind of preconception of how my father would think
speak or act upon any untried occasion or occurrence of lifeThere
was that infinitude of oddities in him and of chances along with it
by which handle he would take a thingit baffled Sir all
calculationsThe truth was his road lay so very far on one side from
that wherein most men travelledthat every object before him presented
a face and section of itself to his eye altogether different from the
plan and elevation of it seen by the rest of mankindIn other words
twas a different object and in course was differently considered

This is the true reason that my dear Jenny and I as well as all the
world besides us have such eternal squabbles about nothingShe looks
at her outsideI at her in How is it possible we should agree
about her value



Chapter 3XXV

Tis a point settledand I mention it for the comfort of Confucius
Mr Shandy is supposed to mean Esq member forand not the
Chinese Legislator who is apt to get entangled in telling a plain
storythat provided he keeps along the line of his storyhe may go
backwards and forwards as he willtis still held to be no digression

This being premised I take the benefit of the act of going backwards
myself



Chapter 3XXVI

Fifty thousand pannier loads of devilsnot of the Archbishop of
BeneventosI mean of Rabelaiss devils with their tails chopped off
by their rumps could not have made so diabolical a scream of it as I
didwhen the accident befel me it summoned up my mother instantly into
the nurseryso that Susannah had but just time to make her escape down
the back stairs as my mother came up the fore

Now though I was old enough to have told the story myselfand young
enough I hope to have done it without malignity yet Susannah in
passing by the kitchen for fear of accidents had left it in shorthand
with the cookthe cook had told it with a commentary to Jonathan and
Jonathan to Obadiah so that by the time my father had rung the bell
half a dozen times to know what was the matter abovewas Obadiah
enabled to give him a particular account of it just as it had
happenedI thought as much said my father tucking up his
nightgownand so walked up stairs

One would imagine from thisthough for my own part I somewhat
question itthat my father before that time had actually wrote that
remarkable character in the Tristrapaedia which to me is the most
original and entertaining one in the whole bookand that is the
chapter upon sashwindows with a bitter Philippick at the end of it
upon the forgetfulness of chambermaidsI have but two reasons for
thinking otherwise

First Had the matter been taken into consideration before the event
happened my father certainly would have nailed up the sash window
for good an allwhich considering with what difficulty he composed
bookshe might have done with ten times less trouble than he could
have wrote the chapter this argument I foresee holds good against his
writing a chapter even after the event but tis obviated under the
second reason which I have the honour to offer to the world in
support of my opinion that my father did not write the chapter upon
sashwindows and chamberpots at the time supposedand it is this

That in order to render the Tristrapaedia completeI wrote the
chapter myself



Chapter 3XXVII

My father put on his spectacleslookedtook them offput them into
the caseall in less than a statutable minute and without opening
his lips turned about and walked precipitately down stairs my mother
imagined he had stepped down for lint and basilicon but seeing him
return with a couple of folios under his arm and Obadiah following him
with a large readingdesk she took it for granted twas an herbal and
so drew him a chair to the bedside that he might consult upon the case
at his ease

If it be but right donesaid my father turning to the Sectionde
sede vel subjecto circumcisionisfor he had brought up Spenser de
Legibus Hebraeorum Ritualibusand Maimonides in order to confront and
examine us altogether

If it be but right done quoth heonly tell us cried my mother
interrupting him what herbsFor that replied my father you must
send for Dr Slop

My mother went down and my father went on reading the section as
follows

Very wellsaid my fathernay if it has that
convenienceand so without stopping a moment to settle it first in his
mind whether the Jews had it from the Egyptians or the Egyptians
from the Jewshe rose up and rubbing his forehead two or three times
across with the palm of his hand in the manner we rub out the footsteps
of care when evil has trod lighter upon us than we forebodedhe shut
the book and walked down stairsNay said he mentioning the name of
a different great nation upon every step as he set his foot upon itif
the Egyptiansthe Syriansthe Phoeniciansthe Arabiansthe
Cappadociansif the Colchi and Troglodytes did itif Solon and
Pythagoras submittedwhat is TristramWho am I that I should fret
or fume one moment about the matter



Chapter 3XXVIII

Dear Yorick said my father smiling for Yorick had broke his rank with
my uncle Toby in coming through the narrow entry and so had stept first
into the parlourthis Tristram of ours I find comes very hardly by
all his religious ritesNever was the son of Jew Christian Turk or
Infidel initiated into them in so oblique and slovenly a mannerBut he
is no worse I trust said YorickThere has been certainly continued
my father the deuce and all to do in some part or other of the
ecliptic when this offspring of mine was formedThat you are a
better judge of than I replied YorickAstrologers quoth my father
know better than us boththe trine and sextil aspects have jumped
awryor the opposite of their ascendents have not hit it as they
shouldor the lords of the genitures as they call them have been at
bopeepor something has been wrong above or below with us

Tis possible answered YorickBut is the child cried my uncle
Toby the worseThe Troglodytes say not replied my father And your
theologists Yorick tell usTheologically said Yorickor speaking
after the manner of apothecaries footnote in Greek Philostatesmen
footnote in Greekor washerwomen footnote in Greek Bochart

Im not sure replied my fatherbut they tell us brother Toby
hes the better for itProvided said Yorick you travel him into
EgyptOf that answered my father he will have the advantage when he
sees the Pyramids

Now every word of this quoth my uncle Toby is Arabic to meI wish
said Yorick twas so to half the world

Ilus footnote in Greek Sanchuniatho continued my father
circumcised his whole army one morningNot without a court martial
cried my uncle TobyThough the learned continued he taking no notice
of my uncle Tobys remark but turning to Yorickare greatly divided
still who Ilus wassome say Saturnsome the Supreme Beingothers
no more than a brigadier general under PharaohnecoLet him be who
he will said my uncle Toby I know not by what article of war he could
justify it

The controvertists answered my father assign twoandtwenty different
reasons for itothers indeed who have drawn their pens on the
opposite side of the question have shewn the world the futility of the
greatest part of themBut then again our best polemic divinesI wish
there was not a polemic divine said Yorick in the kingdomone
ounce of practical divinityis worth a painted shipload of all their
reverences have imported these fifty yearsPray Mr Yorick quoth my
uncle Tobydo tell me what a polemic divine isThe best description
captain Shandy I have ever read is of a couple of em replied Yorick
in the account of the battle fought single hands betwixt Gymnast and
captain Tripet which I have in my pocketI beg I may hear it quoth
my uncle Toby earnestlyYou shall said YorickAnd as the corporal
is waiting for me at the doorand I know the description of a battle
will do the poor fellow more good than his supperI beg brother
youll give him leave to come inWith all my soul said my
fatherTrim came in erect and happy as an emperor and having shut
the door Yorick took a book from his righthand coatpocket and read
or pretended to read as follows



Chapter 3XXIX

which words being heard by all the soldiers which were there divers
of them being inwardly terrified did shrink back and make room for
the assailant all this did Gymnast very well remark and consider and
therefore making as if he would have alighted from off his horse as he
was poising himself on the mounting side he most nimbly with his short
sword by this thigh shifting his feet in the stirrup and performing
the stirrupleather feat whereby after the inclining of his body
downwards he forthwith launched himself aloft into the air and placed
both his feet together upon the saddle standing upright with his back
turned towards his horses headNow said he my case goes forward
Then suddenly in the same posture wherein he was he fetched a gambol
upon one foot and turning to the lefthand failed not to carry his
body perfectly round just into his former position without missing one
jotHa said Tripet I will not do that at this timeand not without
cause Well said Gymnast I have failedI will undo this leap then
with a marvellous strength and agility turning towards the righthand
he fetched another striking gambol as before which done he set his
right hand thumb upon the bow of the saddle raised himself up and
sprung into the air poising and upholding his whole weight upon the
muscle and nerve of the said thumb and so turned and whirled himself
about three times at the fourth reversing his body and overturning it
upside down and foreside back without touching any thing he brought
himself betwixt the horses two ears and then giving himself a jerking
swing he seated himself upon the crupper

This cant be fighting said my uncle TobyThe corporal shook his
head at itHave patience said Yorick

Then Tripet passd his right leg over his saddle and placed himself
en croupBut said he twere better for me to get into the saddle
then putting the thumbs of both hands upon the crupper before him and
thereupon leaning himself as upon the only supporters of his body
he incontinently turned heels over head in the air and strait found
himself betwixt the bow of the saddle in a tolerable seat then
springing into the air with a summerset he turned him about like
a windmill and made above a hundred frisks turns and
demipommadasGood God cried Trim losing all patienceone home
thrust of a bayonet is worth it allI think so too replied Yorick

I am of a contrary opinion quoth my father



Chapter 3XXX

NoI think I have advanced nothing replied my father making answer
to a question which Yorick had taken the liberty to put to himI have
advanced nothing in the Tristrapaedia but what is as clear as any
one proposition in EuclidReach me Trim that book from off the
scrutoirit has ofttimes been in my mind continued my father to
have read it over both to you Yorick and to my brother Toby and
I think it a little unfriendly in myself in not having done it long
agoshall we have a short chapter or two nowand a chapter or two
hereafter as occasions serve and so on till we get through the whole
My uncle Toby and Yorick made the obeisance which was proper and the
corporal though he was not included in the compliment laid his hand
upon his breast and made his bow at the same timeThe company smiled
Trim quoth my father has paid the full price for staying out
the entertainmentHe did not seem to relish the play replied
YorickTwas a Tomfoolbattle an please your reverence of captain
Tripets and that other officer making so many summersets as they
advancedthe French come on capering now and then in that waybut
not quite so much

My uncle Toby never felt the consciousness of his existence with more
complacency than what the corporals and his own reflections made him
do at that momenthe lighted his pipeYorick drew his chair closer
to the tableTrim snuffd the candlemy father stirrd up the
firetook up the bookcoughd twice and begun



Chapter 3XXXI

The first thirty pages said my father turning over the leavesare a
little dry and as they are not closely connected with the subjectfor
the present well pass them by tis a prefatory introduction continued
my father or an introductory preface for I am not determined which
name to give it upon political or civil government the foundation of
which being laid in the first conjunction betwixt male and female
for procreation of the speciesI was insensibly led into itTwas
natural said Yorick

The original of society continued my father Im satisfied is what
Politian tells us i e merely conjugal and nothing more than the
getting together of one man and one womanto which according to
Hesiod the philosopher adds a servantbut supposing in the first
beginning there were no men servants bornhe lays the foundation of
it in a mana womanand a bullI believe tis an ox quoth Yorick
quoting the passage GreekA bull must have given more trouble than
his head was worthBut there is a better reason still said my father
dipping his pen into his ink for the ox being the most patient of
animals and the most useful withal in tilling the ground for their
nourishmentwas the properest instrument and emblem too for the new
joined couple that the creation could have associated with themAnd
there is a stronger reason added my uncle Toby than them all for the
oxMy father had not power to take his pen out of his inkhorn till
he had heard my uncle Tobys reasonFor when the ground was tilled
said my uncle Toby and made worth inclosing then they began to secure
it by walls and ditches which was the origin of fortificationTrue
true dear Toby cried my father striking out the bull and putting the
ox in his place

My father gave Trim a nod to snuff the candle and resumed his
discourse

I enter upon this speculation said my father carelessly and half
shutting the book as he went on merely to shew the foundation of
the natural relation between a father and his child the right and
jurisdiction over whom he acquires these several ways

1st by marriage

2d by adoption

3d by legitimation

And 4th by procreation all which I consider in their order

I lay a slight stress upon one of them replied Yorickthe act
especially where it ends there in my opinion lays as little obligation
upon the child as it conveys power to the fatherYou are wrongsaid
my father argutely and for this plain reasonI own added my
father that the offspring upon this account is not so under the power
and jurisdiction of the motherBut the reason replied Yorick
equally holds good for herShe is under authority herself said my
fatherand besides continued my father nodding his head and laying
his finger upon the side of his nose as he assigned his reasonshe is
not the principal agent YorickIn what quoth my uncle Toby stopping
his pipeThough by all means added my father not attending to
my uncle Toby The son ought to pay her respect as you may read
Yorick at large in the first book of the Institutes of Justinian
at the eleventh title and the tenth sectionI can read it as well
replied Yorick in the Catechism



Chapter 3XXXII

Trim can repeat every word of it by heart quoth my uncle TobyPugh
said my father not caring to be interrupted with Trims saying his
Catechism He can upon my honour replied my uncle TobyAsk him Mr
Yorick any question you please

The fifth Commandment Trimsaid Yorick speaking mildly and with
a gentle nod as to a modest Catechumen The corporal stood silentYou
dont ask him right said my uncle Toby raising his voice and giving
it rapidly like the word of commandThe fifthcried my uncle TobyI
must begin with the first an please your honour said the corporal

Yorick could not forbear smilingYour reverence does not consider
said the corporal shouldering his stick like a musket and marching
into the middle of the room to illustrate his positionthat tis
exactly the same thing as doing ones exercise in the field

Join your righthand to your firelock cried the corporal giving the
word of command and performing the motion

Poise your firelock cried the corporal doing the duty still both of
adjutant and private man

Rest your firelockone motion an please your reverence you see
leads into anotherIf his honour will begin but with the first

The Firstcried my uncle Toby setting his hand upon his side

The Secondcried my uncle Toby waving his tobaccopipe as he would
have done his sword at the head of a regimentThe corporal went
through his manual with exactness and having honoured his father and
mother made a low bow and fell back to the side of the room

Every thing in this world said my father is big with jest and has wit
in it and instruction tooif we can but find it out

Here is the scaffold work of Instruction its true point of folly
without the Building behind it

Here is the glass for pedagogues preceptors tutors governors
gerundgrinders and bearleaders to view themselves in in their true
dimensions

Oh there is a husk and shell Yorick which grows up with learning
which their unskilfulness knows not how to fling away

Sciences May Be Learned by Rote But Wisdom Not

Yorick thought my father inspiredI will enter into obligations
this moment said my father to lay out all my aunt Dinahs legacy in
charitable uses of which by the bye my father had no high opinion
if the corporal has any one determinate idea annexed to any one word
he has repeatedPrithee Trim quoth my father turning round to
himWhat dost thou mean by honouring thy father and mother

Allowing them an please your honour three halfpence a day out of my
pay when they grow oldAnd didst thou do that Trim said YorickHe
did indeed replied my uncle TobyThen Trim said Yorick springing
out of his chair and taking the corporal by the hand thou art the best
commentator upon that part of the Decalogue and I honour thee more for
it corporal Trim than if thou hadst had a hand in the Talmud itself



Chapter 3XXXIII

O blessed health cried my father making an exclamation as he turned
over the leaves to the next chapter thou art before all gold and
treasure tis thou who enlargest the souland openest all its powers
to receive instruction and to relish virtueHe that has thee
has little more to wish forand he that is so wretched as to want
theewants every thing with thee

I have concentrated all that can be said upon this important head said
my father into a very little room therefore well read the chapter
quite through

My father read as follows

The whole secret of health depending upon the due contention for
mastery betwixt the radical heat and the radical moistureYou have
proved that matter of fact I suppose above said Yorick Sufficiently
replied my father

In saying this my father shut the booknot as if he resolved to
read no more of it for he kept his forefinger in the chapternor
pettishlyfor he shut the book slowly his thumb resting when he
had done it upon the upperside of the cover as his three fingers
supported the lower side of it without the least compressive
violence

I have demonstrated the truth of that point quoth my father nodding to
Yorick most sufficiently in the preceding chapter

Now could the man in the moon be told that a man in the earth had wrote
a chapter sufficiently demonstrating That the secret of all health
depended upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the radical heat
and the radical moistureand that he had managed the point so well
that there was not one single word wet or dry upon radical heat or
radical moisture throughout the whole chapteror a single syllable
in it pro or con directly or indirectly upon the contention betwixt
these two powers in any part of the animal oeconomy

O thou eternal Maker of all beingshe would cry striking his breast
with his right hand in case he had oneThou whose power and goodness
can enlarge the faculties of thy creatures to this infinite degree of
excellence and perfectionWhat have we Moonites done



Chapter 3XXXIV

With two strokes the one at Hippocrates the other at Lord Verulam did
my father achieve it

The stroke at the prince of physicians with which he began was no more
than a short insult upon his sorrowful complaint of the Ars longaand
Vita brevisLife short cried my fatherand the art of healing
tedious And who are we to thank for both the one and the other but
the ignorance of quacks themselvesand the stageloads of chymical
nostrums and peripatetic lumber with which in all ages they have
first flatterd the world and at last deceived it

O my lord Verulam cried my father turning from Hippocrates and
making his second stroke at him as the principal of nostrummongers
and the fittest to be made an example of to the restWhat shall I
say to thee my great lord Verulam What shall I say to thy internal
spiritthy opium thy saltpetrethy greasy unctionsthy daily
purgesthy nightly clysters and succedaneums

My father was never at a loss what to say to any man upon any
subject and had the least occasion for the exordium of any man
breathing how he dealt with his lordships opinionyou shall
seebut whenI know notwe must first see what his lordships
opinion was



Chapter 3XXXV

The two great causes which conspire with each other to shorten life
says lord Verulam are first

The internal spirit which like a gentle flame wastes the body down
to deathAnd secondly the external air that parches the body up
to asheswhich two enemies attacking us on both sides of our bodies
together at length destroy our organs and render them unfit to carry
on the functions of life

This being the state of the case the road to longevity was plain
nothing more being required says his lordship but to repair the waste
committed by the internal spirit by making the substance of it more
thick and dense by a regular course of opiates on one side and by
refrigerating the heat of it on the other by three grains and a half of
saltpetre every morning before you got up

Still this frame of ours was left exposed to the inimical assaults of
the air withoutbut this was fenced off again by a course of greasy
unctions which so fully saturated the pores of the skin that no
spicula could enternor could any one get outThis put a stop to all
perspiration sensible and insensible which being the cause of so
many scurvy distempersa course of clysters was requisite to carry off
redundant humoursand render the system complete

What my father had to say to my lord of Verulams opiates his
saltpetre and greasy unctions and clysters you shall readbut not
todayor tomorrow time presses upon memy reader is impatientI
must get forwardsYou shall read the chapter at your leisure if you
chuse it as soon as ever the Tristrapaedia is published

Sufficeth it at present to say my father levelled the hypothesis
with the ground and in doing that the learned know he built up and
established his own



Chapter 3XXXVI

The whole secret of health said my father beginning the sentence
again depending evidently upon the due contention betwixt the radical
heat and radical moisture within usthe least imaginable skill had
been sufficient to have maintained it had not the schoolmen confounded
the task merely as Van Helmont the famous chymist has proved by all
along mistaking the radical moisture for the tallow and fat of animal
bodies

Now the radical moisture is not the tallow or fat of animals but an
oily and balsamous substance for the fat and tallow as also the phlegm
or watery parts are cold whereas the oily and balsamous parts are of a
lively heat and spirit which accounts for the observation of Aristotle
Quod omne animal post coitum est triste

Now it is certain that the radical heat lives in the radical moisture
but whether vice versa is a doubt however when the one decays the
other decays also and then is produced either an unnatural heat which
causes an unnatural drynessor an unnatural moisture which causes
dropsiesSo that if a child as he grows up can but be taught
to avoid running into fire or water as either of em threaten his
destructiontwill be all that is needful to be done upon that head



Chapter 3XXXVII

The description of the siege of Jericho itself could not have
engaged the attention of my uncle Toby more powerfully than the last
chapterhis eyes were fixed upon my father throughout ithe never
mentioned radical heat and radical moisture but my uncle Toby took his
pipe out of his mouth and shook his head and as soon as the chapter
was finished he beckoned to the corporal to come close to his chair
to ask him the following questionaside It was at the siege of
Limerick an please your honour replied the corporal making a bow

The poor fellow and I quoth my uncle Toby addressing himself to my
father were scarce able to crawl out of our tents at the time the
siege of Limerick was raised upon the very account you mentionNow
what can have got into that precious noddle of thine my dear brother
Toby cried my father mentallyBy Heaven continued he communing
still with himself it would puzzle an Oedipus to bring it in point

I believe an please your honour quoth the corporal that if it had
not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every night and the
claret and cinnamon with which I plyed your honour offAnd the geneva
Trim added my uncle Toby which did us more good than allI verily
believe continued the corporal we had both an please your honour
left our lives in the trenches and been buried in them tooThe
noblest grave corporal cried my uncle Toby his eyes sparkling as he
spoke that a soldier could wish to lie down inBut a pitiful death
for him an please your honour replied the corporal

All this was as much Arabick to my father as the rites of the Colchi
and Troglodites had been before to my uncle Toby my father could not
determine whether he was to frown or to smile

My uncle Toby turning to Yorick resumed the case at Limerick more
intelligibly than he had begun itand so settled the point for my
father at once



Chapter 3XXXVIII

It was undoubtedly said my uncle Toby a great happiness for myself
and the corporal that we had all along a burning fever attended with
a most raging thirst during the whole fiveandtwenty days the flux
was upon us in the camp otherwise what my brother calls the radical
moisture must as I conceive it inevitably have got the betterMy
father drew in his lungs topfull of air and looking up blew it forth
again as slowly as he possibly could

It was Heavens mercy to us continued my uncle Toby which put it
into the corporals head to maintain that due contention betwixt the
radical heat and the radical moisture by reinforceing the fever as he
did all along with hot wine and spices whereby the corporal kept up
as it were a continual firing so that the radical heat stood its
ground from the beginning to the end and was a fair match for the
moisture terrible as it wasUpon my honour added my uncle Toby
you might have heard the contention within our bodies brother Shandy
twenty toisesIf there was no firing said Yorick

Wellsaid my father with a full aspiration and pausing a while after
the wordWas I a judge and the laws of the country which made me one
permitted it I would condemn some of the worst malefactors provided
they had had their clergyYorick foreseeing the sentence was likely
to end with no sort of mercy laid his hand upon my fathers breast and
begged he would respite it for a few minutes till he asked the corporal
a questionPrithee Trim said Yorick without staying for my fathers
leavetell us honestlywhat is thy opinion concerning this selfsame
radical heat and radical moisture

With humble submission to his honours better judgment quoth the
corporal making a bow to my uncle TobySpeak thy opinion freely
corporal said my uncle TobyThe poor fellow is my servantnot my
slaveadded my uncle Toby turning to my father

The corporal put his hat under his left arm and with his stick hanging
upon the wrist of it by a black thong split into a tassel about the
knot he marched up to the ground where he had performed his catechism
then touching his underjaw with the thumb and fingers of his right hand
before he opened his mouthhe delivered his notion thus



Chapter 3XXXIX

Just as the corporal was humming to beginin waddled Dr SlopTis
not twopence matterthe corporal shall go on in the next chapter let
who will come in

Well my good doctor cried my father sportively for the transitions of
his passions were unaccountably suddenand what has this whelp of mine
to say to the matter

Had my father been asking after the amputation of the tail of a
puppydoghe could not have done it in a more careless air the system
which Dr Slop had laid down to treat the accident by no way allowed
of such a mode of enquiryHe sat down

Pray Sir quoth my uncle Toby in a manner which could not go
unansweredin what condition is the boyTwill end in a phimosis
replied Dr Slop

I am no wiser than I was quoth my uncle Tobyreturning his pipe
into his mouthThen let the corporal go on said my father with his
medical lectureThe corporal made a bow to his old friend Dr Slop
and then delivered his opinion concerning radical heat and radical
moisture in the following words



Chapter 3XL

The city of Limerick the siege of which was begun under his majesty
king William himself the year after I went into the armylies
an please your honours in the middle of a devilish wet swampy
countryTis quite surrounded said my uncle Toby with the Shannon
and is by its situation one of the strongest fortified places in
Ireland

I think this is a new fashion quoth Dr Slop of beginning a medical
lectureTis all true answered TrimThen I wish the faculty would
follow the cut of it said YorickTis all cut through an please
your reverence said the corporal with drains and bogs and besides
there was such a quantity of rain fell during the siege the whole
country was like a puddletwas that and nothing else which brought
on the flux and which had like to have killed both his honour and
myself now there was no such thing after the first ten days continued
the corporal for a soldier to lie dry in his tent without cutting a
ditch round it to draw off the waternor was that enough for those
who could afford it as his honour could without setting fire every
night to a pewter dish full of brandy which took off the damp of the
air and made the inside of the tent as warm as a stove

And what conclusion dost thou draw corporal Trim cried my father from
all these premises

I infer an please your worship replied Trim that the radical
moisture is nothing in the world but ditchwaterand that the radical
heat of those who can go to the expence of it is burnt brandythe
radical heat and moisture of a private man an please your honour is
nothing but ditchwaterand a dram of genevaand give us but enough
of it with a pipe of tobacco to give us spirits and drive away the
vapourswe know not what it is to fear death

I am at a loss Captain Shandy quoth Doctor Slop to determine in which
branch of learning your servant shines most whether in physiology or
divinitySlop had not forgot Trims comment upon the sermon

It is but an hour ago replied Yorick since the corporal was examined
in the latter and passed muster with great honour

The radical heat and moisture quoth Doctor Slop turning to my father
you must know is the basis and foundation of our beingas the root of
a tree is the source and principle of its vegetationIt is inherent
in the seeds of all animals and may be preserved sundry ways
but principally in my opinion by consubstantials impriments and
occludentsNow this poor fellow continued Dr Slop pointing to the
corporal has had the misfortune to have heard some superficial empiric
discourse upon this nice pointThat he hassaid my fatherVery
likely said my uncleIm sure of itquoth Yorick



Chapter 3XLI

Doctor Slop being called out to look at a cataplasm he had ordered it
gave my father an opportunity of going on with another chapter in the
TristrapaediaCome cheer up my lads Ill shew you landfor when
we have tugged through that chapter the book shall not be opened again
this twelvemonthHuzza



Chapter 3XLII

Five years with a bib under his chin

Four years in travelling from Christcrossrow to Malachi

A year and a half in learning to write his own name

Seven long years and more Greeking it at Greek and Latin

Four years at his probations and his negationsthe fine statue still
lying in the middle of the marble blockand nothing done but his
tools sharpened to hew it outTis a piteous delayWas not the great
Julius Scaliger within an ace of never getting his tools sharpened at
allFortyfour years old was he before he could manage his Greekand
Peter Damianus lord bishop of Ostia as all the world knows could not
so much as read when he was of mans estateAnd Baldus himself as
eminent as he turned out after entered upon the law so late in life
that every body imagined he intended to be an advocate in the other
world no wonder when Eudamidas the son of Archidamas heard
Xenocrates at seventyfive disputing about wisdom that he asked
gravelyIf the old man be yet disputing and enquiring concerning
wisdomwhat time will he have to make use of it

Yorick listened to my father with great attention there was a seasoning
of wisdom unaccountably mixed up with his strangest whims and he had
sometimes such illuminations in the darkest of his eclipses as almost
atoned for thembe wary Sir when you imitate him

I am convinced Yorick continued my father half reading and half
discoursing that there is a Northwest passage to the intellectual
world and that the soul of man has shorter ways of going to work in
furnishing itself with knowledge and instruction than we generally take
with itBut alack all fields have not a river or a spring running
besides themevery child Yorick has not a parent to point it out

The whole entirely depends added my father in a low voice upon the
auxiliary verbs Mr Yorick

Had Yorick trod upon Virgils snake he could not have looked more
surprisedI am surprised too cried my father observing itand
I reckon it as one of the greatest calamities which ever befel the
republic of letters That those who have been entrusted with the
education of our children and whose business it was to open their
minds and stock them early with ideas in order to set the imagination
loose upon them have made so little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing
it as they have doneSo that except Raymond Lullius and the elder
Pelegrini the last of which arrived to such perfection in the use of
em with his topics that in a few lessons he could teach a young
gentleman to discourse with plausibility upon any subject pro and con
and to say and write all that could be spoken or written concerning it
without blotting a word to the admiration of all who beheld himI
should be glad said Yorick interrupting my father to be made to
comprehend this matter You shall said my father

The highest stretch of improvement a single word is capable of is a
high metaphorfor which in my opinion the idea is generally the
worse and not the betterbut be that as it maywhen the mind
has done that with itthere is an endthe mind and the idea are at
restuntil a second idea entersand so on

Now the use of the Auxiliaries is at once to set the soul agoing
by herself upon the materials as they are brought her and by the
versability of this great engine round which they are twisted to open
new tracts of enquiry and make every idea engender millions

You excite my curiosity greatly said Yorick

For my own part quoth my uncle Toby I have given it upThe Danes
an please your honour quoth the corporal who were on the left at the
siege of Limerick were all auxiliariesAnd very good ones said my
uncle TobyBut the auxiliaries Trim my brother is talking aboutI
conceive to be different things

You do said my father rising up



Chapter 3XLIII

My father took a single turn across the room then sat down and
finished the chapter

The verbs auxiliary we are concerned in here continued my father are
am was have had do did make made suffer shall should will
would can could owe ought used or is wontAnd these varied with
tenses present past future and conjugated with the verb seeor
with these questions added to themIs it Was it Will it be Would it
be May it be Might it be And these again put negatively Is it not
Was it not Ought it notOr affirmativelyIt is It was It ought to
be Or chronologicallyHas it been always Lately How long agoOr
hypotheticallyIf it was If it was not What would followIf the
French should beat the English If the Sun go out of the Zodiac

Now by the right use and application of these continued my father
in which a childs memory should be exercised there is no one idea can
enter his brain how barren soever but a magazine of conceptions and
conclusions may be drawn forth from itDidst thou ever see a white
bear cried my father turning his head round to Trim who stood at
the back of his chairNo an please your honour replied the
corporalBut thou couldst discourse about one Trim said my father
in case of needHow is it possible brother quoth my uncle Toby
if the corporal never saw oneTis the fact I want replied my
fatherand the possibility of it is as follows

A White Bear Very well Have I ever seen one Might I ever have seen
one Am I ever to see one Ought I ever to have seen one Or can I ever
see one

Would I had seen a white bear for how can I imagine it

If I should see a white bear what should I say If I should never see a
white bear what then

If I never have can must or shall see a white bear alive have I ever
seen the skin of one Did I ever see one painteddescribed Have I
never dreamed of one

Did my father mother uncle aunt brothers or sisters ever see a
white bear What would they give How would they behave How would the
white bear have behaved Is he wild Tame Terrible Rough Smooth

Is the white bear worth seeing

Is there no sin in it

Is it better than a Black One



Chapter 3XLIV

Well not stop two moments my dear Sironly as we have got through
these five volumes In the first edition the sixth volume began with
this chapter do Sir sit down upon a setthey are better
than nothing let us just look back upon the country we have passd
through

What a wilderness has it been and what a mercy that we have not both
of us been lost or devoured by wild beasts in it

Did you think the world itself Sir had contained such a number of Jack
AssesHow they viewd and reviewd us as we passed over the rivulet at
the bottom of that little valleyand when we climbed over that hill
and were just getting out of sightgood God what a braying did they
all set up together

Prithee shepherd who keeps all those Jack Asses

Heaven be their comforterWhat are they never curriedAre they
never taken in in winterBray braybray Bray onthe world is
deeply your debtorlouder stillthats nothingin good sooth you
are illusedWas I a Jack Asse I solemnly declare I would bray in
Gsolreut from morning even unto night



Chapter 3XLV

When my father had danced his white bear backwards and forwards through
half a dozen pages he closed the book for good an alland in a kind
of triumph redelivered it into Trims hand with a nod to lay it upon
the scrutoire where he found itTristram said he shall be made to
conjugate every word in the dictionary backwards and forwards the same
wayevery word Yorick by this means you see is converted into a
thesis or an hypothesisevery thesis and hypothesis have an offspring
of propositionsand each proposition has its own consequences and
conclusions every one of which leads the mind on again into fresh
tracks of enquiries and doubtingsThe force of this engine added my
father is incredible in opening a childs headTis enough brother
Shandy cried my uncle Toby to burst it into a thousand splinters

I presume said Yorick smilingit must be owing to thisfor let
logicians say what they will it is not to be accounted for sufficiently
from the bare use of the ten predicamentsThat the famous Vincent
Quirino amongst the many other astonishing feats of his childhood of
which the Cardinal Bembo has given the world so exact a storyshould
be able to paste up in the public schools at Rome so early as in the
eighth year of his age no less than four thousand five hundred and
fifty different theses upon the most abstruse points of the most
abstruse theologyand to defend and maintain them in such sort as to
cramp and dumbfound his opponentsWhat is that cried my father to
what is told us of Alphonsus Tostatus who almost in his nurses arms
learned all the sciences and liberal arts without being taught any one
of themWhat shall we say of the great PiereskiusThats the very
man cried my uncle Toby I once told you of brother Shandy who walked
a matter of five hundred miles reckoning from Paris to Shevling and
from Shevling back again merely to see Stevinuss flying chariotHe
was a very great man added my uncle Toby meaning StevinusHe was so
brother Toby said my father meaning Piereskiusand had multiplied
his ideas so fast and increased his knowledge to such a prodigious
stock that if we may give credit to an anecdote concerning him which
we cannot withhold here without shaking the authority of all anecdotes
whateverat seven years of age his father committed entirely to
his care the education of his younger brother a boy of five years
oldwith the sole management of all his concernsWas the father
as wise as the son quoth my uncle TobyI should think not said
YorickBut what are these continued my fatherbreaking out in a
kind of enthusiasmwhat are these to those prodigies of childhood
in Grotius Scioppius Heinsius Politian Pascal Joseph Scaliger
Ferdinand de Cordoue and otherssome of which left off their
substantial forms at nine years old or sooner and went on reasoning
without themothers went through their classics at sevenwrote
tragedies at eightFerdinand de Cordoue was so wise at ninetwas
thought the Devil was in himand at Venice gave such proofs of his
knowledge and goodness that the monks imagined he was Antichrist or
nothingOthers were masters of fourteen languages at tenfinished
the course of their rhetoric poetry logic and ethics at elevenput
forth their commentaries upon Servius and Martianus Capella at
twelveand at thirteen received their degrees in philosophy laws and
divinitybut you forget the great Lipsius quoth Yorick who composed
a work Nous aurions quelque interet says Baillet de montrer quil na
rien de ridicule sil etoit veritable au moins dans le sens enigmatique
que Nicius Erythraeus a ta he de lui donner Cet auteur dit que pour
comprendre comme Lipse il a pu composer un ouvrage le premier jour de
sa vie il faut simaginer que ce premier jour nest pas celui de
sa naissance charnelle mais celui au quel il a commence duser de
la raison il veut que cait ete a lage de neuf ans et il nous veut
persuader que ce fut en cet age que Lipse fit un poemeLe tour est
ingenieux c c the day he was bornThey should have wiped it up
said my uncle Toby and said no more about it



Chapter 3XLVI

When the cataplasm was ready a scruple of decorum had unseasonably rose
up in Susannahs conscience about holding the candle whilst Slop tied
it on Slop had not treated Susannahs distemper with anodynesand so
a quarrel had ensued betwixt them

Oh ohsaid Slop casting a glance of undue freedom in Susannahs
face as she declined the officethen I think I know you madamYou
know me Sir cried Susannah fastidiously and with a toss of her
head levelled evidently not at his profession but at the doctor
himselfyou know me cried Susannah againDoctor Slop clapped his
finger and his thumb instantly upon his nostrilsSusannahs spleen
was ready to burst at itTis false said SusannahCome come Mrs
Modesty said Slop not a little elated with the success of his last
thrustIf you wont hold the candle and lookyou may hold it and
shut your eyesThats one of your popish shifts cried SusannahTis
better said Slop with a nod than no shift at all young womanI
defy you Sir cried Susannah pulling her shift sleeve below her elbow

It was almost impossible for two persons to assist each other in a
surgical case with a more splenetic cordiality

Slop snatched up the cataplasmSusannah snatched up the candleA
little this way said Slop Susannah looking one way and rowing
another instantly set fire to Slops wig which being somewhat bushy
and unctuous withal was burnt out before it was well kindledYou
impudent whore cried Slopfor what is passion but a wild
beastyou impudent whore cried Slop getting upright with the
cataplasm in his handI never was the destruction of any bodys nose
said Susannahwhich is more than you can sayIs it cried Slop
throwing the cataplasm in her faceYes it is cried Susannah
returning the compliment with what was left in the pan



Chapter 3XLVII

Doctor Slop and Susannah filed crossbills against each other in the
parlour which done as the cataplasm had failed they retired into the
kitchen to prepare a fomentation for meand whilst that was doing my
father determined the point as you will read



Chapter 3XLVIII

You see tis high time said my father addressing himself equally to my
uncle Toby and Yorick to take this young creature out of these womens
hands and put him into those of a private governor Marcus Antoninus
provided fourteen governors all at once to superintend his son
Commoduss educationand in six weeks he cashiered five of themI
know very well continued my father that Commoduss mother was in love
with a gladiator at the time of her conception which accounts for a
great many of Commoduss cruelties when he became emperorbut still I
am of opinion that those five whom Antoninus dismissed did Commoduss
temper in that short time more hurt than the other nine were able to
rectify all their lives long

Now as I consider the person who is to be about my son as the mirror
in which he is to view himself from morning to night by which he is to
adjust his looks his carriage and perhaps the inmost sentiments of his
heartI would have one Yorick if possible polished at all points
fit for my child to look intoThis is very good sense quoth my uncle
Toby to himself

There is continued my father a certain mien and motion of the body
and all its parts both in acting and speaking which argues a man well
within and I am not at all surprised that Gregory of Nazianzum upon
observing the hasty and untoward gestures of Julian should foretel he
would one day become an apostateor that St Ambrose should turn his
Amanuensis out of doors because of an indecent motion of his head
which went backwards and forwards like a flailor that Democritus
should conceive Protagoras to be a scholar from seeing him bind up a
faggot and thrusting as he did it the small twigs inwardsThere
are a thousand unnoticed openings continued my father which let a
penetrating eye at once into a mans soul and I maintain it added he
that a man of sense does not lay down his hat in coming into a roomor
take it up in going out of it but something escapes which discovers
him

It is for these reasons continued my father that the governor I make
choice of shall neither Vid Pellegrina lisp or squint or wink or
talk loud or look fierce or foolishor bite his lips or grind
his teeth or speak through his nose or pick it or blow it with his
fingersHe shall neither walk fastor slow or fold his armsfor
that is lazinessor hang them downfor that is folly or hide them
in his pocket for that is nonsense

He shall neither strike or pinch or tickleor bite or cut his
nails or hawk or spit or snift or drum with his feet or fingers in
companynor according to Erasmus shall he speak to any one in making
waternor shall he point to carrion or excrementNow this is all
nonsense again quoth my uncle Toby to himself

I will have him continued my father cheerful facete jovial at the
same time prudent attentive to business vigilant acute argute
inventive quick in resolving doubts and speculative questionshe
shall be wise and judicious and learnedAnd why not humble and
moderate and gentletempered and good said YorickAnd why not
cried my uncle Toby free and generous and bountiful and braveHe
shall my dear Toby replied my father getting up and shaking him by
his handThen brother Shandy answered my uncle Toby raising himself
off the chair and laying down his pipe to take hold of my fathers
other handI humbly beg I may recommend poor Le Fevers son to youa
tear of joy of the first water sparkled in my uncle Tobys eye and
another the fellow to it in the corporals as the proposition was
madeyou will see why when you read Le Fevers storyfool that I
was nor can I recollect nor perhaps you without turning back to the
place what it was that hindered me from letting the corporal tell it in
his own wordsbut the occasion is lostI must tell it now in my own



Chapter 3XLIX

The Story of Le Fever

It was some time in the summer of that year in which Dendermond was
taken by the allieswhich was about seven years before my father came
into the countryand about as many after the time that my uncle Toby
and Trim had privately decamped from my fathers house in town in order
to lay some of the finest sieges to some of the finest fortified cities
in Europewhen my uncle Toby was one evening getting his supper with
Trim sitting behind him at a small sideboardI say sittingfor in
consideration of the corporals lame knee which sometimes gave him
exquisite painwhen my uncle Toby dined or supped alone he would
never suffer the corporal to stand and the poor fellows veneration for
his master was such that with a proper artillery my uncle Toby could
have taken Dendermond itself with less trouble than he was able to gain
this point over him for many a time when my uncle Toby supposed the
corporals leg was at rest he would look back and detect him standing
behind him with the most dutiful respect this bred more little
squabbles betwixt them than all other causes for fiveandtwenty years
togetherBut this is neither here nor therewhy do I mention itAsk
my penit governs meI govern not it

He was one evening sitting thus at his supper when the landlord of a
little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in
his hand to beg a glass or two of sack Tis for a poor gentlemanI
think of the army said the landlord who has been taken ill at my
house four days ago and has never held up his head since or had a
desire to taste any thing till just now that he has a fancy for a
glass of sack and a thin toastI think says he taking his hand from
his forehead it would comfort me

If I could neither beg borrow or buy such a thingadded the
landlordI would almost steal it for the poor gentleman he is so
illI hope in God he will still mend continued hewe are all of us
concerned for him

Thou art a goodnatured soul I will answer for thee cried my uncle
Toby and thou shalt drink the poor gentlemans health in a glass of
sack thyselfand take a couple of bottles with my service and tell
him he is heartily welcome to them and to a dozen more if they will do
him good

Though I am persuaded said my uncle Toby as the landlord shut the
door he is a very compassionate fellowTrimyet I cannot help
entertaining a high opinion of his guest too there must be something
more than common in him that in so short a time should win so much
upon the affections of his hostAnd of his whole family added the
corporal for they are all concerned for himStep after him said my
uncle Tobydo Trimand ask if he knows his name

I have quite forgot it truly said the landlord coming back into the
parlour with the corporalbut I can ask his son againHas he a son
with him then said my uncle TobyA boy replied the landlord of
about eleven or twelve years of agebut the poor creature has tasted
almost as little as his father he does nothing but mourn and lament for
him night and dayHe has not stirred from the bedside these two days

My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork and thrust his plate from
before him as the landlord gave him the account and Trim without
being ordered took away without saying one word and in a few minutes
after brought him his pipe and tobacco

Stay in the room a little said my uncle Toby

Trimsaid my uncle Toby after he lighted his pipe and smoakd about
a dozen whiffsTrim came in front of his master and made his bowmy
uncle Toby smoakd on and said no moreCorporal said my uncle
Tobythe corporal made his bowMy uncle Toby proceeded no farther
but finished his pipe

Trim said my uncle Toby I have a project in my head as it is a bad
night of wrapping myself up warm in my roquelaure and paying a visit
to this poor gentlemanYour honours roquelaure replied the corporal
has not once been had on since the night before your honour received
your wound when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St
Nicholasand besides it is so cold and rainy a night that what with
the roquelaure and what with the weather twill be enough to give your
honour your death and bring on your honours torment in your groin I
fear so replied my uncle Toby but I am not at rest in my mind Trim
since the account the landlord has given meI wish I had not known so
much of this affairadded my uncle Tobyor that I had known more of
itHow shall we manage it Leave it ant please your honour to me
quoth the corporalIll take my hat and stick and go to the house and
reconnoitre and act accordingly and I will bring your honour a full
account in an hourThou shalt go Trim said my uncle Toby and heres
a shilling for thee to drink with his servantI shall get it all out
of him said the corporal shutting the door

My uncle Toby filled his second pipe and had it not been that he now
and then wandered from the point with considering whether it was not
full as well to have the curtain of the tennaile a straight line as a
crooked onehe might be said to have thought of nothing else but poor
Le Fever and his boy the whole time he smoaked it



Chapter 3L

The Story of Le Fever Continued

It was not till my uncle Toby had knocked the ashes out of his third
pipe that corporal Trim returned from the inn and gave him the
following account

I despaired at first said the corporal of being able to bring
back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick
lieutenantIs he in the army then said my uncle TobyHe is said
the corporalAnd in what regiment said my uncle TobyIll tell your
honour replied the corporal every thing straight forwards as I learnt
itThen Trim Ill fill another pipe said my uncle Toby and not
interrupt thee till thou hast done so sit down at thy ease Trim in
the windowseat and begin thy story again The corporal made his old
bow which generally spoke as plain as a bow could speak itYour honour
is goodAnd having done that he sat down as he was orderedand
begun the story to my uncle Toby over again in pretty near the same
words

I despaired at first said the corporal of being able to bring back any
intelligence to your honour about the lieutenant and his son for when
I asked where his servant was from whom I made myself sure of knowing
every thing which was proper to be askedThats a right distinction
Trim said my uncle TobyI was answered an please your honour that
he had no servant with himthat he had come to the inn with hired
horses which upon finding himself unable to proceed to join I
suppose the regiment he had dismissed the morning after he cameIf
I get better my dear said he as he gave his purse to his son to pay
the manwe can hire horses from henceBut alas the poor gentleman
will never get from hence said the landlady to mefor I heard the
deathwatch all night longand when he dies the youth his son will
certainly die with him for he is brokenhearted already

I was hearing this account continued the corporal when the youth came
into the kitchen to order the thin toast the landlord spoke ofbut I
will do it for my father myself said the youthPray let my save you
the trouble young gentleman said I taking up a fork for the purpose
and offering him my chair to sit down upon by the fire whilst I did
itI believe Sir said he very modestly I can please him best
myselfI am sure said I his honour will not like the toast the worse
for being toasted by an old soldierThe youth took hold of my hand
and instantly burst into tearsPoor youth said my uncle Tobyhe
has been bred up from an infant in the army and the name of a soldier
Trim sounded in his ears like the name of a friendI wish I had him
here

I never in the longest march said the corporal had so great a mind
to my dinner as I had to cry with him for companyWhat could be the
matter with me an please your honour Nothing in the world Trim
said my uncle Toby blowing his nosebut that thou art a goodnatured
fellow

When I gave him the toast continued the corporal I thought it was
proper to tell him I was captain Shandys servant and that your honour
though a stranger was extremely concerned for his fatherand that
if there was any thing in your house or cellarAnd thou mightst have
added my purse too said my uncle Tobyhe was heartily welcome to
itHe made a very low bow which was meant to your honour but no
answerfor his heart was fullso he went up stairs with the toastI
warrant you my dear said I as I opened the kitchendoor your father
will be well againMr Yoricks curate was smoking a pipe by the
kitchen firebut said not a word good or bad to comfort the youthI
thought it wrong added the corporalI think so too said my uncle
Toby

When the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast he felt
himself a little revived and sent down into the kitchen to let me
know that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I would step
up stairsI believe said the landlord he is going to say his
prayersfor there was a book laid upon the chair by his bedside and
as I shut the door I saw his son take up a cushion

I thought said the curate that you gentlemen of the army Mr Trim
never said your prayers at allI heard the poor gentleman say his
prayers last night said the landlady very devoutly and with my own
ears or I could not have believed itAre you sure of it replied the
curateA soldier an please your reverence said I prays as often
of his own accord as a parsonand when he is fighting for his king
and for his own life and for his honour too he has the most reason
to pray to God of any one in the whole worldTwas well said of thee
Trim said my uncle TobyBut when a soldier said I an please your
reverence has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches
up to his knees in cold wateror engaged said I for months
together in long and dangerous marchesharassed perhaps in his rear
todayharassing others tomorrowdetached herecountermanded
thereresting this night out upon his armsbeat up in his shirt the
nextbenumbed in his jointsperhaps without straw in his tent to
kneel onmust say his prayers how and when he canI believe said
Ifor I was piqued quoth the corporal for the reputation of the
armyI believe an please your reverence said I that when a soldier
gets time to prayhe prays as heartily as a parsonthough not with
all his fuss and hypocrisyThou shouldst not have said that Trim
said my uncle Tobyfor God only knows who is a hypocrite and who is
notAt the great and general review of us all corporal at the day of
judgment and not till thenit will be seen who has done their
duties in this worldand who has not and we shall be advanced Trim
accordinglyI hope we shall said TrimIt is in the Scripture said
my uncle Toby and I will shew it thee tomorrowIn the mean time we
may depend upon it Trim for our comfort said my uncle Toby that God
Almighty is so good and just a governor of the world that if we have
but done our duties in itit will never be enquired into whether
we have done them in a red coat or a black oneI hope not said the
corporalBut go on Trim said my uncle Toby with thy story

When I went up continued the corporal into the lieutenants room
which I did not do till the expiration of the ten minuteshe was lying
in his bed with his head raised upon his hand with his elbow upon the
pillow and a clean white cambrick handkerchief beside itThe youth
was just stooping down to take up the cushion upon which I supposed he
had been kneelingthe book was laid upon the bedand as he rose in
taking up the cushion with one hand he reached out his other to take
it away at the same timeLet it remain there my dear said the
lieutenant

He did not offer to speak to me till I had walked up close to his
bedsideIf you are captain Shandys servant said he you must
present my thanks to your master with my little boys thanks along
with them for his courtesy to meif he was of Levensssaid the
lieutenantI told him your honour wasThen said he I served three
campaigns with him in Flanders and remember himbut tis most likely
as I had not the honour of any acquaintance with him that he knows
nothing of meYou will tell him however that the person his
goodnature has laid under obligations to him is one Le Fever a
lieutenant in Angussbut he knows me notsaid he a second time
musingpossibly he may my storyadded hepray tell the captain I
was the ensign at Breda whose wife was most unfortunately killed with
a musketshot as she lay in my arms in my tentI remember the story
ant please your honour said I very wellDo you so said he wiping
his eyes with his handkerchiefthen well may IIn saying this he
drew a little ring out of his bosom which seemed tied with a black
ribband about his neck and kissd it twiceHere Billy said hethe
boy flew across the room to the bedsideand falling down upon his
knee took the ring in his hand and kissed it toothen kissed his
father and sat down upon the bed and wept

I wish said my uncle Toby with a deep sighI wish Trim I was
asleep

Your honour replied the corporal is too much concernedshall I pour
your honour out a glass of sack to your pipeDo Trim said my uncle
Toby

I remember said my uncle Toby sighing again the story of the ensign
and his wife with a circumstance his modesty omittedand particularly
well that he as well as she upon some account or other I forget what
was universally pitied by the whole regimentbut finish the story thou
art uponTis finished already said the corporalfor I could stay
no longerso wished his honour a good night young Le Fever rose from
off the bed and saw me to the bottom of the stairs and as we went down
together told me they had come from Ireland and were on their route
to join the regiment in FlandersBut alas said the corporalthe
lieutenants last days march is overThen what is to become of his
poor boy cried my uncle Toby

It was to my uncle Tobys eternal honourthough I tell it only for the
sake of those who when coopd in betwixt a natural and a positive
law know not for their souls which way in the world to turn
themselvesThat notwithstanding my uncle Toby was warmly engaged at
that time in carrying on the siege of Dendermond parallel with the
allies who pressed theirs on so vigorously that they scarce allowed
him time to get his dinnerthat nevertheless he gave up Dendermond
though he had already made a lodgment upon the counterscarpand bent
his whole thoughts towards the private distresses at the inn and except
that he ordered the garden gate to be bolted up by which he might be
said to have turned the siege of Dendermond into a blockadehe left
Dendermond to itselfto be relieved or not by the French king as the
French king thought good and only considered how he himself should
relieve the poor lieutenant and his son

That kind Being who is a friend to the friendless shall recompence
thee for this

Thou hast left this matter short said my uncle Toby to the corporal as
he was putting him to bedand I will tell thee in what TrimIn the
first place when thou madest an offer of my services to Le Feveras
sickness and travelling are both expensive and thou knowest he was but
a poor lieutenant with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his
paythat thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse because had
he stood in need thou knowest Trim he had been as welcome to it as
myselfYour honour knows said the corporal I had no ordersTrue
quoth my uncle Tobythou didst very right Trim as a soldierbut
certainly very wrong as a man

In the second place for which indeed thou hast the same excuse
continued my uncle Tobywhen thou offeredst him whatever was in my
housethou shouldst have offered him my house tooA sick brother
officer should have the best quarters Trim and if we had him with
uswe could tend and look to himThou art an excellent nurse
thyself Trimand what with thy care of him and the old womans and
his boys and mine together we might recruit him again at once and
set him upon his legs

In a fortnight or three weeks added my uncle Toby smilinghe might
marchHe will never march an please your honour in this world said
the corporalHe will march said my uncle Toby rising up from the
side of the bed with one shoe offAn please your honour said the
corporal he will never march but to his graveHe shall march cried
my uncle Toby marching the foot which had a shoe on though without
advanceing an inchhe shall march to his regimentHe cannot
stand it said the corporalHe shall be supported said my uncle
TobyHell drop at last said the corporal and what will become
of his boyHe shall not drop said my uncle Toby
firmlyAwellodaydo what we can for him said Trim maintaining
his pointthe poor soul will dieHe shall not die by G cried my
uncle Toby

The Accusing Spirit which flew up to heavens chancery with the oath
blushd as he gave it inand the Recording Angel as he wrote it down
droppd a tear upon the word and blotted it out for ever



Chapter 3LII

My uncle Toby went to his bureauput his purse into his breeches
pocket and having ordered the corporal to go early in the morning for a
physicianhe went to bed and fell asleep



Chapter 3LIII

The Story of Le Fever Continued

The sun looked bright the morning after to every eye in the village but
Le Fevers and his afflicted sons the hand of death pressed heavy upon
his eyelidsand hardly could the wheel at the cistern turn round its
circlewhen my uncle Toby who had rose up an hour before his wonted
time entered the lieutenants room and without preface or apology sat
himself down upon the chair by the bedside and independently of all
modes and customs opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and
brother officer would have done it and asked him how he didhow
he had rested in the nightwhat was his complaintwhere was his
painand what he could do to help himand without giving him time
to answer any one of the enquiries went on and told him of the little
plan which he had been concerting with the corporal the night before for
him

You shall go home directly Le Fever said my uncle Toby to my
houseand well send for a doctor to see whats the matterand well
have an apothecaryand the corporal shall be your nurseand Ill be
your servant Le Fever

There was a frankness in my uncle Tobynot the effect of
familiaritybut the cause of itwhich let you at once into his soul
and shewed you the goodness of his nature to this there was something
in his looks and voice and manner superadded which eternally
beckoned to the unfortunate to come and take shelter under him so that
before my uncle Toby had half finished the kind offers he was making to
the father had the son insensibly pressed up close to his knees and
had taken hold of the breast of his coat and was pulling it towards
himThe blood and spirits of Le Fever which were waxing cold and
slow within him and were retreating to their last citadel the
heartrallied backthe film forsook his eyes for a momenthe
looked up wishfully in my uncle Tobys facethen cast a look upon his
boyand that ligament fine as it waswas never broken

Nature instantly ebbd againthe film returned to its
placethe pulse flutteredstoppdwent onthrobbdstoppd

Chapter 3LIV

I am so impatient to return to my own story that what remains of young
Le Fevers that is from this turn of his fortune to the time my uncle
Toby recommended him for my preceptor shall be told in a very few words
in the next chapterAll that is necessary to be added to this chapter
is as follows

That my uncle Toby with young Le Fever in his hand attended the poor
lieutenant as chief mourners to his grave

That the governor of Dendermond paid his obsequies all military
honoursand that Yorick not to be behindhandpaid him all
ecclesiasticfor he buried him in his chancelAnd it appears
likewise he preached a funeral sermon over himI say it appearsfor
it was Yoricks custom which I suppose a general one with those of
his profession on the first leaf of every sermon which he composed
to chronicle down the time the place and the occasion of its being
preached to this he was ever wont to add some short comment
or stricture upon the sermon itself seldom indeed much to its
creditFor instance This sermon upon the Jewish dispensationI
dont like it at allThough I own there is a world of WaterLandish
knowledge in itbut tis all tritical and most tritically put
togetherThis is but a flimsy kind of a composition what was in my
head when I made it

NB The excellency of this text is that it will suit any
sermonand of this sermonthat it will suit any text

For this sermon I shall be hangedfor I have stolen the greatest
part of it Doctor Paidagunes found me out  Set a thief to catch a
thief

On the back of half a dozen I find written So so and no moreand
upon a couple Moderato by which as far as one may gather from
Altieris Italian dictionarybut mostly from the authority of a piece
of green whipcord which seemed to have been the unravelling of Yoricks
whiplash with which he has left us the two sermons marked Moderato
and the half dozen of So so tied fast together in one bundle by
themselvesone may safely suppose he meant pretty near the same thing

There is but one difficulty in the way of this conjecture which is
this that the moderatos are five times better than the so sosshow
ten times more knowledge of the human hearthave seventy times
more wit and spirit in themand to rise properly in my
climaxdiscovered a thousand times more geniusand to crown all are
infinitely more entertaining than those tied up with themfor which
reason wheneer Yoricks dramatic sermons are offered to the world
though I shall admit but one out of the whole number of the so sos I
shall nevertheless adventure to print the two moderatos without any
sort of scruple

What Yorick could mean by the words lentamentetenutegraveand
sometimes adagioas applied to theological compositions and with
which he has characterised some of these sermons I dare not venture
to guessI am more puzzled still upon finding a loctava alta
upon oneCon strepito upon the back of anotherScicilliana upon a
thirdAlla capella upon a fourthCon larco upon thisSenza larco
upon thatAll I know is that they are musical terms and have a
meaningand as he was a musical man I will make no doubt but that by
some quaint application of such metaphors to the compositions in hand
they impressed very distinct ideas of their several characters upon his
fancywhatever they may do upon that of others

Amongst these there is that particular sermon which has unaccountably
led me into this digressionThe funeral sermon upon poor Le Fever
wrote out very fairly as if from a hasty copyI take notice of it
the more because it seems to have been his favourite compositionIt
is upon mortality and is tied lengthways and crossways with a yarn
thrum and then rolled up and twisted round with a halfsheet of dirty
blue paper which seems to have been once the cast cover of a general
review which to this day smells horribly of horse drugsWhether these
marks of humiliation were designedI something doubtbecause at the
end of the sermon and not at the beginning of itvery different from
his way of treating the rest he had wroteBravo

Though not very offensivelyfor it is at two inches at least and
a halfs distance from and below the concluding line of the sermon
at the very extremity of the page and in that right hand corner of it
which you know is generally covered with your thumb and to do it
justice it is wrote besides with a crows quill so faintly in a small
Italian hand as scarce to solicit the eye towards the place whether
your thumb is there or notso that from the manner of it it stands
half excused and being wrote moreover with very pale ink diluted
almost to nothingtis more like a ritratto of the shadow of vanity
than of Vanity herselfof the two resembling rather a faint thought of
transient applause secretly stirring up in the heart of the composer
than a gross mark of it coarsely obtruded upon the world

With all these extenuations I am aware that in publishing this I
do no service to Yoricks character as a modest manbut all men have
their failings and what lessens this still farther and almost wipes it
away is this that the word was struck through sometime afterwards as
appears from a different tint of the ink with a line quite across it in
this manner BRAVO crossed outas if he had retracted or was ashamed
of the opinion he had once entertained of it

These short characters of his sermons were always written excepting in
this one instance upon the first leaf of his sermon which served as a
cover to it and usually upon the inside of it which was turned towards
the textbut at the end of his discourse where perhaps he had five
or six pages and sometimes perhaps a whole score to turn himself
inhe took a large circuit and indeed a much more mettlesome
oneas if he had snatched the occasion of unlacing himself with a
few more frolicksome strokes at vice than the straitness of the pulpit
allowedThese though hussarlike they skirmish lightly and out of
all order are still auxiliaries on the side of virtuetell me then

Chapter 3LV

When my uncle Toby had turned every thing into money and settled all
accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and Le Fever and betwixt Le
Fever and all mankindthere remained nothing more in my uncle Tobys
hands than an old regimental coat and a sword so that my uncle Toby
found little or no opposition from the world in taking administration
The coat my uncle Toby gave the corporalWear it Trim said my
uncle Toby as long as it will hold together for the sake of the poor
lieutenantAnd thissaid my uncle Toby taking up the sword in his
hand and drawing it out of the scabbard as he spokeand this Le
Fever Ill save for theetis all the fortune continued my uncle
Toby hanging it up upon a crook and pointing to ittis all the
fortune my dear Le Fever which God has left thee but if he has given
thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the worldand thou doest it
like a man of honourtis enough for us

As soon as my uncle Toby had laid a foundation and taught him to
inscribe a regular polygon in a circle he sent him to a public school
where excepting Whitsontide and Christmas at which times the corporal
was punctually dispatched for himhe remained to the spring of the
year seventeen when the stories of the emperors sending his army into
Hungary against the Turks kindling a spark of fire in his bosom he
left his Greek and Latin without leave and throwing himself upon his
knees before my uncle Toby begged his fathers sword and my
uncle Tobys leave along with it to go and try his fortune under
EugeneTwice did my uncle Toby forget his wound and cry out Le Fever
I will go with thee and thou shalt fight beside meAnd twice he
laid his hand upon his groin and hung down his head in sorrow and
disconsolation

My uncle Toby took down the sword from the crook where it had hung
untouched ever since the lieutenants death and delivered it to
the corporal to brighten upand having detained Le Fever a single
fortnight to equip him and contract for his passage to Leghornhe
put the sword into his handIf thou art brave Le Fever said my
uncle Toby this will not fail theebut Fortune said he musing a
littleFortune mayAnd if she doesadded my uncle Toby embracing
him come back again to me Le Fever and we will shape thee another
course

The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of Le Fever more
than my uncle Tobys paternal kindnesshe parted from my uncle Toby
as the best of sons from the best of fathersboth dropped tearsand as
my uncle Toby gave him his last kiss he slipped sixty guineas tied up
in an old purse of his fathers in which was his mothers ring into
his handand bid God bless him



Chapter 3LVI

Le Fever got up to the Imperial army just time enough to try what metal
his sword was made of at the defeat of the Turks before Belgrade but
a series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment
and trod close upon his heels for four years together after he had
withstood these buffetings to the last till sickness overtook him at
Marseilles from whence he wrote my uncle Toby word he had lost his
time his services his health and in short every thing but his
swordand was waiting for the first ship to return back to him

As this letter came to hand about six weeks before Susannahs accident
Le Fever was hourly expected and was uppermost in my uncle Tobys mind
all the time my father was giving him and Yorick a description of what
kind of a person he would chuse for a preceptor to me but as my uncle
Toby thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments
he required he forbore mentioning Le Fevers nametill the character
by Yoricks interposition ending unexpectedly in one who should be
gentletempered and generous and good it impressed the image of
Le Fever and his interest upon my uncle Toby so forcibly he rose
instantly off his chair and laying down his pipe in order to take hold
of both my fathers handsI beg brother Shandy said my uncle Toby
I may recommend poor Le Fevers son to youI beseech you do added
YorickHe has a good heart said my uncle TobyAnd a brave one too
an please your honour said the corporal

The best hearts Trim are ever the bravest replied my uncle
TobyAnd the greatest cowards an please your honour in our
regiment were the greatest rascals in itThere was serjeant Kumber
and ensign

Well talk of them said my father another time



Chapter 3LVII

What a jovial and a merry world would this be may it please your
worships but for that inextricable labyrinth of debts cares woes
want grief discontent melancholy large jointures impositions and
lies

Doctor Slop like a son of a w as my father called him for itto
exalt himselfdebased me to deathand made ten thousand times more
of Susannahs accident than there was any grounds for so that in a
weeks time or less it was in every bodys mouth That poor Master
ShandyentirelyAnd Fame who loves to double every thingin
three days more had sworn positively she saw itand all the world
as usual gave credit to her evidenceThat the nursery window had not
onlybut that s also

Could the world have been sued like a BodyCorporatemy father had
brought an action upon the case and trounced it sufficiently but to
fall foul of individuals about itas every soul who had mentioned the
affair did it with the greatest pity imaginabletwas like flying
in the very face of his best friendsAnd yet to acquiesce under the
report in silencewas to acknowledge it openlyat least in the
opinion of one half of the world and to make a bustle again in
contradicting itwas to confirm it as strongly in the opinion of the
other half

Was ever poor devil of a country gentleman so hampered said my
father

I would shew him publickly said my uncle Toby at the market cross

Twill have no effect said my father



Chapter 3LVIII

Ill put him however into breeches said my fatherlet the world
say what it will



Chapter 3LIX

There are a thousand resolutions Sir both in church and state as well
as in matters Madam of a more private concernwhich though they
have carried all the appearance in the world of being taken and
entered upon in a hasty harebrained and unadvised manner were
notwithstanding this and could you or I have got into the cabinet
or stood behind the curtain we should have found it was so weighed
poized and perpendedargued uponcanvassed throughentered into
and examined on all sides with so much coolness that the Goddess of
Coolness herself I do not take upon me to prove her existence could
neither have wished it or done it better

Of the number of these was my fathers resolution of putting me into
breeches which though determined at oncein a kind of huff and a
defiance of all mankind had nevertheless been prod and connd and
judicially talked over betwixt him and my mother about a month before
in two several beds of justice which my father had held for that
purpose I shall explain the nature of these beds of justice in my next
chapter and in the chapter following that you shall step with me
Madam behind the curtain only to hear in what kind of manner my
father and my mother debated between themselves this affair of the
breechesfrom which you may form an idea how they debated all lesser
matters



Chapter 3LX

The ancient Goths of Germany who the learned Cluverius is positive
were first seated in the country between the Vistula and the Oder and
who afterwards incorporated the Herculi the Bugians and some other
Vandallick clans to emhad all of them a wise custom of debating every
thing of importance to their state twice that isonce drunk and
once soberDrunkthat their councils might not want vigourand
soberthat they might not want discretion

Now my father being entirely a waterdrinkerwas a long time gravelled
almost to death in turning this as much to his advantage as he did
every other thing which the ancients did or said and it was not till
the seventh year of his marriage after a thousand fruitless experiments
and devices that he hit upon an expedient which answered the
purposeand that was when any difficult and momentous point was to be
settled in the family which required great sobriety and great spirit
too in its determinationhe fixed and set apart the first Sunday
night in the month and the Saturday night which immediately preceded
it to argue it over in bed with my mother By which contrivance if
you consider Sir with yourself 

These my father humorously enough called his beds of justicefor
from the two different counsels taken in these two different humours a
middle one was generally found out which touched the point of wisdom as
well as if he had got drunk and sober a hundred times

I must not be made a secret of to the world that this answers full as
well in literary discussions as either in military or conjugal but it
is not every author that can try the experiment as the Goths and Vandals
did itor if he can may it be always for his bodys health and to do
it as my father did itam I sure it would be always for his souls

My way is this

In all nice and ticklish discussionsof which heaven knows there
are but too many in my bookwhere I find I cannot take a step without
the danger of having either their worships or their reverences upon
my backI write onehalf fulland tother fastingor write it all
fulland correct it fastingor write it fastingand correct
it full for they all come to the same thingSo that with a less
variation from my fathers plan than my fathers from the GothickI
feel myself upon a par with him in his first bed of justiceand no
way inferior to him in his secondThese different and almost
irreconcileable effects flow uniformly from the wise and wonderful
mechanism of natureof whichbe hers the honourAll that we
can do is to turn and work the machine to the improvement and better
manufactory of the arts and sciences

Now when I write fullI write as if I was never to write fasting
again as long as I livethat is I write free from the cares as well
as the terrors of the worldI count not the number of my scarsnor
does my fancy go forth into dark entries and byecorners to antedate my
stabsIn a word my pen takes its course and I write on as much from
the fulness of my heart as my stomach

But when an please your honours I indite fasting tis a different
historyI pay the world all possible attention and respectand have
as great a share whilst it lasts of that under strapping virtue of
discretion as the best of youSo that betwixt both I write a careless
kind of a civil nonsensical goodhumoured Shandean book which will do
all your hearts good

And all your heads tooprovided you understand it



Chapter 3LXI

We should begin said my father turning himself half round in bed
and shifting his pillow a little towards my mothers as he opened the
debateWe should begin to think Mrs Shandy of putting this boy into
breeches

We should sosaid my motherWe defer it my dear quoth my father
shamefully

I think we do Mr Shandysaid my mother

Not but the child looks extremely well said my father in his vests
and tunicks

He does look very well in themreplied my mother

And for that reason it would be almost a sin added my father to take
him out of em

It would sosaid my motherBut indeed he is growing a very tall
ladrejoined my father

He is very tall for his age indeedsaid my mother

I can not making two syllables of it imagine quoth my father who
the deuce he takes after

I cannot conceive for my life said my mother

Humphsaid my father

The dialogue ceased for a moment

I am very short myselfcontinued my father gravely

You are very short Mr Shandysaid my mother

Humph quoth my father to himself a second time in muttering which he
plucked his pillow a little further from my mothersand turning about
again there was an end of the debate for three minutes and a half

When he gets these breeches made cried my father in a higher tone
hell look like a beast in em

He will be very awkward in them at first replied my mother

And twill be lucky if thats the worst ont added my father

It will be very lucky answered my mother

I suppose replied my fathermaking some pause firsthell be
exactly like other peoples children

Exactly said my mother

Though I shall be sorry for that added my father and so the debate
stoppd again

They should be of leather said my father turning him about again

They will last him said my mother the longest

But he can have no linings to em replied my father

He cannot said my mother

Twere better to have them of fustian quoth my father

Nothing can be better quoth my mother

Except dimityreplied my fatherTis best of allreplied my
mother

One must not give him his death howeverinterrupted my father

By no means said my motherand so the dialogue stood still again

I am resolved however quoth my father breaking silence the fourth
time he shall have no pockets in them

There is no occasion for any said my mother

I mean in his coat and waistcoatcried my father

I mean so tooreplied my mother

Though if he gets a gig or topPoor souls it is a crown and a
sceptre to themthey should have where to secure it

Order it as you please Mr Shandy replied my mother

But dont you think it right added my father pressing the point home
to her

Perfectly said my mother if it pleases you Mr Shandy

Theres for you cried my father losing his temperPleases meYou
never will distinguish Mrs Shandy nor shall I ever teach you to do
it betwixt a point of pleasure and a point of convenienceThis was on
the Sunday nightand further this chapter sayeth not



Chapter 3LXII

After my father had debated the affair of the breeches with my
motherhe consulted Albertus Rubenius upon it and Albertus Rubenius
used my father ten times worse in the consultation if possible than
even my father had used my mother For as Rubenius had wrote a quarto
express De re Vestiaria Veterumit was Rubeniuss business to have
given my father some lightsOn the contrary my father might as well
have thought of extracting the seven cardinal virtues out of a long
beardas of extracting a single word out of Rubenius upon the subject

Upon every other article of ancient dress Rubenius was very
communicative to my fathergave him a full satisfactory account of

 The Toga or loose gown
 The Chlamys
 The Ephod
 The Tunica or Jacket
 The Synthesis
 The Paenula
 The Lacema with its Cucullus
 The Paludamentum
 The Praetexta
 The Sagum or soldiers jerkin
 The Trabea of which according to Suetonius there was three kinds

But what are all these to the breeches said my father

Rubenius threw him down upon the counter all kinds of shoes which had
been in fashion with the Romans

 There was
 The open shoe
 The close shoe
 The slip shoe
 The wooden shoe
 The soc
 The buskin
 And The military shoe with hobnails in it which Juvenal takes
 notice of

 There were
 The clogs
 The pattins
 The pantoufles
 The brogues
 The sandals with latchets to them

 There was
 The felt shoe
 The linen shoe
 The laced shoe
 The braided shoe
 The calceus incisus
 And The calceus rostratus

Rubenius shewed my father how well they all fittedin what manner they
laced onwith what points straps thongs latchets ribbands jaggs
and ends

But I want to be informed about the breeches said my father

Albertus Rubenius informed my father that the Romans manufactured
stuffs of various fabricssome plainsome stripedothers diapered
throughout the whole contexture of the wool with silk and goldThat
linen did not begin to be in common use till towards the declension of
the empire when the Egyptians coming to settle amongst them brought it
into vogue

That persons of quality and fortune distinguished themselves by the
fineness and whiteness of their clothes which colour next to purple
which was appropriated to the great offices they most affected and
wore on their birthdays and public rejoicingsThat it appeared from
the best historians of those times that they frequently sent their
clothes to the fuller to be cleand and whitenedbut that the
inferior people to avoid that expence generally wore brown clothes
and of a something coarser texturetill towards the beginning of
Augustuss reign when the slave dressed like his master and almost
every distinction of habiliment was lost but the Latus Clavus

And what was the Latus Clavus said my father

Rubenius told him that the point was still litigating amongst the
learnedThat Egnatius Sigonius Bossius Ticinensis Bayfius Budaeus
Salmasius Lipsius Lazius Isaac Casaubon and Joseph Scaliger all
differed from each otherand he from them That some took it to be the
buttonsome the coat itselfothers only the colour of itThat the
great Bayfuis in his Wardrobe of the Ancients chap 12honestly said
he knew not what it waswhether a tibulaa studa buttona
loopa buckleor clasps and keepers

My father lost the horse but not the saddleThey are hooks and eyes
said my fatherand with hooks and eyes he ordered my breeches to be
made



Chapter 3LXIII

We are now going to enter upon a new scene of events

Leave we then the breeches in the taylors hands with my father
standing over him with his cane reading him as he sat at work a
lecture upon the latus clavus and pointing to the precise part of the
waistband where he was determined to have it sewed on

Leave we my mothertruest of all the Pococurantes of her
sexcareless about it as about every thing else in the world which
concerned herthat isindifferent whether it was done this way or
thatprovided it was but done at all

Leave we Slop likewise to the full profits of all my dishonours

Leave we poor Le Fever to recover and get home from Marseilles as he
canAnd last of allbecause the hardest of all

Let us leave if possible myselfBut tis impossibleI must go
along with you to the end of the work



Chapter 3LXIV

If the reader has not a clear conception of the rood and the half of
ground which lay at the bottom of my uncle Tobys kitchengarden and
which was the scene of so many of his delicious hoursthe fault is not
in mebut in his imaginationfor I am sure I gave him so minute a
description I was almost ashamed of it

When Fate was looking forwards one afternoon into the great
transactions of future timesand recollected for what purposes
this little plot by a decree fast bound down in iron had been
destinedshe gave a nod to Naturetwas enoughNature threw half a
spade full of her kindliest compost upon it with just so much clay in
it as to retain the forms of angles and indentingsand so little of
it too as not to cling to the spade and render works of so much glory
nasty in foul weather

My uncle Toby came down as the reader has been informed with plans
along with him of almost every fortified town in Italy and Flanders
so let the duke of Marlborough or the allies have set down before what
town they pleased my uncle Toby was prepared for them

His way which was the simplest one in the world was this as soon as
ever a town was investedbut sooner when the design was known to take
the plan of it let it be what town it would and enlarge it upon a
scale to the exact size of his bowlinggreen upon the surface of which
by means of a large role of packthread and a number of small piquets
driven into the ground at the several angles and redans he transferred
the lines from his paper then taking the profile of the place with its
works to determine the depths and slopes of the ditchesthe talus of
the glacis and the precise height of the several banquets parapets
che set the corporal to workand sweetly went it onThe nature
of the soilthe nature of the work itselfand above all the
goodnature of my uncle Toby sitting by from morning to night and
chatting kindly with the corporal upon pastdone deedsleft Labour
little else but the ceremony of the name

When the place was finished in this manner and put into a proper
posture of defenceit was investedand my uncle Toby and the
corporal began to run their first parallelI beg I may not be
interrupted in my story by being told That the first parallel should
be at least three hundred toises distant from the main body of the
placeand that I have not left a single inch for itfor my uncle
Toby took the liberty of incroaching upon his kitchengarden for the
sake of enlarging his works on the bowlinggreen and for that reason
generally ran his first and second parallels betwixt two rows of his
cabbages and his cauliflowers the conveniences and inconveniences of
which will be considered at large in the history of my uncle Tobys
and the corporals campaigns of which this Im now writing is but a
sketch and will be finished if I conjecture right in three pages but
there is no guessingThe campaigns themselves will take up as many
books and therefore I apprehend it would be hanging too great a weight
of one kind of matter in so flimsy a performance as this to rhapsodize
them as I once intended into the body of the worksurely they
had better be printed apartwell consider the affairso take the
following sketch of them in the mean time



Chapter 3LXV

When the town with its works was finished my uncle Toby and the
corporal began to run their first parallelnot at random or any
howbut from the same points and distances the allies had begun to run
theirs and regulating their approaches and attacks by the accounts
my uncle Toby received from the daily papersthey went on during the
whole siege step by step with the allies

When the duke of Marlborough made a lodgmentmy uncle Toby made a
lodgment tooAnd when the face of a bastion was battered down or a
defence ruinedthe corporal took his mattock and did as muchand
so ongaining ground and making themselves masters of the works one
after another till the town fell into their hands

To one who took pleasure in the happy state of othersthere could not
have been a greater sight in world than on a post morning in which a
practicable breach had been made by the duke of Marlborough in the
main body of the placeto have stood behind the hornbeam hedge and
observed the spirit with which my uncle Toby with Trim behind him
sallied forththe one with the Gazette in his handthe other with a
spade on his shoulder to execute the contentsWhat an honest triumph
in my uncle Tobys looks as he marched up to the ramparts What intense
pleasure swimming in his eye as he stood over the corporal reading the
paragraph ten times over to him as he was at work lest peradventure
he should make the breach an inch too wideor leave it an inch too
narrowBut when the chamade was beat and the corporal helped my uncle
up it and followed with the colours in his hand to fix them upon the
rampartsHeaven Earth Seabut what avails apostropheswith
all your elements wet or dry ye never compounded so intoxicating a
draught

In this track of happiness for many years without one interruption to
it except now and then when the wind continued to blow due west for a
week or ten days together which detained the Flanders mail and kept
them so long in torturebut still twas the torture of the happyIn
this track I say did my uncle Toby and Trim move for many years every
year of which and sometimes every month from the invention of either
the one or the other of them adding some new conceit or quirk of
improvement to their operations which always opened fresh springs of
delight in carrying them on

The first years campaign was carried on from beginning to end in the
plain and simple method Ive related

In the second year in which my uncle Toby took Liege and Ruremond he
thought he might afford the expence of four handsome drawbridges of
two of which I have given an exact description in the former part of my
work

At the latter end of the same year he added a couple of gates with
portcullisesThese last were converted afterwards into orgues as
the better thing and during the winter of the same year my uncle Toby
instead of a new suit of clothes which he always had at Christmas
treated himself with a handsome sentrybox to stand at the corner of
the bowlinggreen betwixt which point and the foot of the glacis
there was left a little kind of an esplanade for him and the corporal to
confer and hold councils of war upon

The sentrybox was in case of rain

All these were painted white three times over the ensuing spring which
enabled my uncle Toby to take the field with great splendour

My father would often say to Yorick that if any mortal in the whole
universe had done such a thing except his brother Toby it would have
been looked upon by the world as one of the most refined satires upon
the parade and prancing manner in which Lewis XIV from the beginning of
the war but particularly that very year had taken the fieldBut tis
not my brother Tobys nature kind soul my father would add to insult
any one

But let us go on



Chapter 3LXVI

I must observe that although in the first years campaign the word
town is often mentionedyet there was no town at that time within the
polygon that addition was not made till the summer following the spring
in which the bridges and sentrybox were painted which was the third
year of my uncle Tobys campaignswhen upon his taking Amberg Bonn
and Rhinberg and Huy and Limbourg one after another a thought came
into the corporals head that to talk of taking so many towns without
one Town to shew for itwas a very nonsensical way of going to work
and so proposed to my uncle Toby that they should have a little model
of a town built for themto be run up together of slit deals and then
painted and clapped within the interior polygon to serve for all

My uncle Toby felt the good of the project instantly and instantly
agreed to it but with the addition of two singular improvements of
which he was almost as proud as if he had been the original inventor of
the project itself

The one was to have the town built exactly in the style of those of
which it was most likely to be the representativewith grated windows
and the gable ends of the houses facing the streets c cas those
in Ghent and Bruges and the rest of the towns in Brabant and Flanders

The other was not to have the houses run up together as the corporal
proposed but to have every house independent to hook on or off so
as to form into the plan of whatever town they pleased This was put
directly into hand and many and many a look of mutual congratulation
was exchanged between my uncle Toby and the corporal as the carpenter
did the work

It answered prodigiously the next summerthe town was a perfect
ProteusIt was Landen and Trerebach and Santvliet and Drusen and
Hagenauand then it was Ostend and Menin and Aeth and Dendermond

Surely never did any Town act so many parts since Sodom and Gomorrah
as my uncle Tobys town did

In the fourth year my uncle Toby thinking a town looked foolishly
without a church added a very fine one with a steepleTrim was for
having bells in itmy uncle Toby said the metal had better be cast
into cannon

This led the way the next campaign for half a dozen brass fieldpieces
to be planted three and three on each side of my uncle Tobys
sentrybox and in a short time these led the way for a train
of somewhat largerand so onas must always be the case in
hobbyhorsical affairs from pieces of half an inch bore till it came
at last to my fathers jack boots

The next year which was that in which Lisle was besieged and at the
close of which both Ghent and Bruges fell into our handsmy uncle
Toby was sadly put to it for proper ammunitionI say proper
ammunitionbecause his great artillery would not bear powder and twas
well for the Shandy family they would notFor so full were the papers
from the beginning to the end of the siege of the incessant firings
kept up by the besiegersand so heated was my uncle Tobys imagination
with the accounts of them that he had infallibly shot away all his
estate

Something therefore was wanting as a succedaneum especially in one or
two of the more violent paroxysms of the siege to keep up something
like a continual firing in the imaginationand this something the
corporal whose principal strength lay in invention supplied by an
entire new system of battering of his ownwithout which this had been
objected to by military critics to the end of the world as one of the
great desiderata of my uncle Tobys apparatus

This will not be explained the worse for setting off as I generally
do at a little distance from the subject



Chapter 3LXVII

With two or three other trinkets small in themselves but of great
regard which poor Tom the corporals unfortunate brother had sent him
over with the account of his marriage with the Jews widowthere was

A Monterocap and two Turkish tobaccopipes

The Monterocap I shall describe by and byeThe Turkish tobaccopipes
had nothing particular in them they were fitted up and ornamented as
usual with flexible tubes of Morocco leather and gold wire and mounted
at their ends the one of them with ivorythe other with black ebony
tippd with silver

My father who saw all things in lights different from the rest of the
world would say to the corporal that he ought to look upon these
two presents more as tokens of his brothers nicety than his
affectionTom did not care Trim he would say to put on the cap
or to smoke in the tobaccopipe of a JewGod bless your honour the
corporal would say giving a strong reason to the contraryhow can
that be

The Monterocap was scarlet of a superfine Spanish cloth dyed in
grain and mounted all round with fur except about four inches in the
front which was faced with a light blue slightly embroideredand
seemed to have been the property of a Portuguese quartermaster not of
foot but of horse as the word denotes

The corporal was not a little proud of it as well for its own sake as
the sake of the giver so seldom or never put it on but upon Galadays
and yet never was a Monterocap put to so many uses for in all
controverted points whether military or culinary provided the corporal
was sure he was in the rightit was either his oathhis wageror
his gift

Twas his gift in the present case

Ill be bound said the corporal speaking to himself to give away
my Monterocap to the first beggar who comes to the door if I do not
manage this matter to his honours satisfaction

The completion was no further off than the very next morning which was
that of the storm of the counterscarp betwixt the Lower Deule to the
right and the gate St Andrewand on the left between St Magdalens
and the river

As this was the most memorable attack in the whole warthe most
gallant and obstinate on both sidesand I must add the most bloody
too for it cost the allies themselves that morning above eleven hundred
menmy uncle Toby prepared himself for it with a more than ordinary
solemnity

The eve which preceded as my uncle Toby went to bed he ordered his
ramallie wig which had laid inside out for many years in the corner of
an old campaigning trunk which stood by his bedside to be taken out
and laid upon the lid of it ready for the morningand the very first
thing he did in his shirt when he had stepped out of bed my uncle
Toby after he had turned the rough side outwardsput it onThis
done he proceeded next to his breeches and having buttoned the
waistband he forthwith buckled on his swordbelt and had got his
sword half way inwhen he considered he should want shaving and that
it would be very inconvenient doing it with his sword onso took it
offIn essaying to put on his regimental coat and waistcoat my uncle
Toby found the same objection in his wigso that went off tooSo
that what with one thing and what with another as always falls out when
a man is in the most hastetwas ten oclock which was half an hour
later than his usual time before my uncle Toby sallied out



Chapter 3LXVIII

My uncle Toby had scarce turned the corner of his yew hedge which
separated his kitchengarden from his bowlinggreen when he perceived
the corporal had begun the attack without him

Let me stop and give you a picture of the corporals apparatus and of
the corporal himself in the height of his attack just as it struck my
uncle Toby as he turned towards the sentrybox where the corporal
was at workfor in nature there is not such anothernor can any
combination of all that is grotesque and whimsical in her works produce
its equal

The corporal

Tread lightly on his ashes ye men of geniusfor he was your
kinsman

Weed his grave clean ye men of goodnessfor he was your brotherOh
corporal had I thee but nownow that I am able to give thee a
dinner and protectionhow would I cherish thee thou shouldst wear
thy Monterocap every hour of the day and every day of the weekand
when it was worn out I would purchase thee a couple like itBut alas
alas alas now that I can do this in spite of their reverencesthe
occasion is lostfor thou art gonethy genius fled up to the stars
from whence it cameand that warm heart of thine with all its
generous and open vessels compressed into a clod of the valley

But whatwhat is this to that future and dreaded page where I look
towards the velvet pall decorated with the military ensigns of thy
masterthe firstthe foremost of created beingswhere I shall see
thee faithful servant laying his sword and scabbard with a trembling
hand across his coffin and then returning pale as ashes to the door
to take his mourning horse by the bridle to follow his hearse as he
directed theewhereall my fathers systems shall be baffled by his
sorrows and in spite of his philosophy I shall behold him as he
inspects the lackered plate twice taking his spectacles from off his
nose to wipe away the dew which nature has shed upon themWhen I see
him cast in the rosemary with an air of disconsolation which cries
through my earsO Toby in what corner of the world shall I seek thy
fellow

Gracious powers which erst have opened the lips of the dumb in his
distress and made the tongue of the stammerer speak plainwhen I shall
arrive at this dreaded page deal not with me then with a stinted
hand



Chapter 3LXIX

The corporal who the night before had resolved in his mind to supply
the grand desideratum of keeping up something like an incessant firing
upon the enemy during the heat of the attackhad no further idea in
his fancy at that time than a contrivance of smoking tobacco against
the town out of one of my uncle Tobys six fieldpieces which were
planted on each side of his sentrybox the means of effecting which
occurring to his fancy at the same time though he had pledged his cap
he thought it in no danger from the miscarriage of his projects

Upon turning it this way and that a little in his mind he soon began
to find out that by means of his two Turkish tobaccopipes with the
supplement of three smaller tubes of washleather at each of their
lower ends to be taggd by the same number of tinpipes fitted to
the touchholes and sealed with clay next the cannon and then tied
hermetically with waxed silk at their several insertions into the
Morocco tubehe should be able to fire the six fieldpieces all
together and with the same ease as to fire one

Let no man say from what taggs and jaggs hints may not be cut out for
the advancement of human knowledge Let no man who has read my fathers
first and second beds of justice ever rise up and say again from
collision of what kinds of bodies light may or may not be struck out to
carry the arts and sciences up to perfectionHeaven thou knowest how
I love themthou knowest the secrets of my heart and that I would
this moment give my shirtThou art a fool Shandy says Eugenius for
thou hast but a dozen in the worldand twill break thy set

No matter for that Eugenius I would give the shirt off my back to be
burnt into tinder were it only to satisfy one feverish enquirer how
many sparks at one good stroke a good flint and steel could strike
into the tail of itThink ye not that in striking these inhe might
peradventure strike something out as sure as a gun

But this project by the bye

The corporal sat up the best part of the night in bringing his to
perfection and having made a sufficient proof of his cannon with
charging them to the top with tobaccohe went with contentment to bed



Chapter 3LXX

The corporal had slipped out about ten minutes before my uncle Toby in
order to fix his apparatus and just give the enemy a shot or two before
my uncle Toby came

He had drawn the six fieldpieces for this end all close up together in
front of my uncle Tobys sentrybox leaving only an interval of about
a yard and a half betwixt the three on the right and left for the
convenience of charging cand the sake possibly of two batteries
which he might think double the honour of one

In the rear and facing this opening with his back to the door of the
sentrybox for fear of being flanked had the corporal wisely taken his
postHe held the ivory pipe appertaining to the battery on the right
betwixt the finger and thumb of his right handand the ebony pipe
tippd with silver which appertained to the battery on the left
betwixt the finger and thumb of the otherand with his right knee fixed
firm upon the ground as if in the front rank of his platoon was the
corporal with his Monterocap upon his head furiously playing off his
two cross batteries at the same time against the counterguard which
faced the counterscarp where the attack was to be made that morning
His first intention as I said was no more than giving the enemy a
single puff or twobut the pleasure of the puffs as well as the
puffing had insensibly got hold of the corporal and drawn him on from
puff to puff into the very height of the attack by the time my uncle
Toby joined him

Twas well for my father that my uncle Toby had not his will to make
that day



Chapter 3LXXI

My uncle Toby took the ivory pipe out of the corporals handlooked at
it for half a minute and returned it

In less than two minutes my uncle Toby took the pipe from the corporal
again and raised it half way to his mouththen hastily gave it back a
second time

The corporal redoubled the attackmy uncle Toby smiledthen looked
gravethen smiled for a momentthen looked serious for a long
timeGive me hold of the ivory pipe Trim said my uncle Tobymy
uncle Toby put it to his lipsdrew it back directlygave a peep over
the hornbeam hedgenever did my uncle Tobys mouth water so much for
a pipe in his lifeMy uncle Toby retired into the sentrybox with the
pipe in his hand

Dear uncle Toby dont go into the sentrybox with the pipetheres
no trusting a mans self with such a thing in such a corner



Chapter 3LXXII

I beg the reader will assist me here to wheel off my uncle Tobys
ordnance behind the scenesto remove his sentrybox and clear the
theatre if possible of hornworks and half moons and get the rest
of his military apparatus out of the waythat done my dear friend
Garrick well snuff the candles brightsweep the stage with a new
broomdraw up the curtain and exhibit my uncle Toby dressed in a new
character throughout which the world can have no idea how he will act
and yet if pity be akin to loveand bravery no alien to it you have
seen enough of my uncle Toby in these to trace these family likenesses
betwixt the two passions in case there is one to your hearts content

Vain science thou assistest us in no case of this kindand thou
puzzlest us in every one

There was Madam in my uncle Toby a singleness of heart which misled
him so far out of the little serpentine tracks in which things of this
nature usually go on you canyou can have no conception of it with
this there was a plainness and simplicity of thinking with such
an unmistrusting ignorance of the plies and foldings of the heart of
womanand so naked and defenceless did he stand before you when a
siege was out of his head that you might have stood behind any one
of your serpentine walks and shot my uncle Toby ten times in a day
through his liver if nine times in a day Madam had not served your
purpose

With all this Madamand what confounded every thing as much on the
other hand my uncle Toby had that unparalleled modesty of nature I
once told you of and which by the bye stood eternal sentry upon
his feelings that you might as soonBut where am I going these
reflections crowd in upon me ten pages at least too soon and take up
that time which I ought to bestow upon facts



Chapter 3LXXIII

Of the few legitimate sons of Adam whose breasts never felt what
the sting of love wasmaintaining first all mysogynists to be
bastardsthe greatest heroes of ancient and modern story have carried
off amongst them nine parts in ten of the honour and I wish for their
sakes I had the key of my study out of my drawwell only for five
minutes to tell you their namesrecollect them I cannotso be content
to accept of these for the present in their stead

There was the great king Aldrovandus and Bosphorus and Cappadocius
and Dardanus and Pontus and Asiusto say nothing of the ironhearted
Charles the XIIth whom the Countess of K herself could make
nothing ofThere was Babylonicus and Mediterraneus and Polixenes
and Persicus and Prusicus not one of whom except Cappadocius and
Pontus who were both a little suspected ever once bowed down his
breast to the goddessThe truth is they had all of them something else
to doand so had my uncle Tobytill Fatetill Fate I say envying his
name the glory of being handed down to posterity with Aldrovanduss and
the restshe basely patched up the peace of Utrecht

Believe me Sirs twas the worst deed she did that year



Chapter 3LXXIV

Amongst the many ill consequences of the treaty of Utrecht it was
within a point of giving my uncle Toby a surfeit of sieges and though
he recovered his appetite afterwards yet Calais itself left not a
deeper scar in Marys heart than Utrecht upon my uncle Tobys To the
end of his life he never could hear Utrecht mentioned upon any account
whateveror so much as read an article of news extracted out of the
Utrecht Gazette without fetching a sigh as if his heart would break in
twain

My father who was a great MotiveMonger and consequently a very
dangerous person for a man to sit by either laughing or cryingfor he
generally knew your motive for doing both much better than you knew it
yourselfwould always console my uncle Toby upon these occasions in a
way which shewed plainly he imagined my uncle Toby grieved for nothing
in the whole affair so much as the loss of his hobbyhorseNever
mind brother Toby he would sayby Gods blessing we shall have
another war break out again some of these days and when it doesthe
belligerent powers if they would hang themselves cannot keep us out of
playI defy em my dear Toby he would add to take countries without
taking townsor towns without sieges

My uncle Toby never took this backstroke of my fathers at his
hobbyhorse kindlyHe thought the stroke ungenerous and the more
so because in striking the horse he hit the rider too and in the most
dishonourable part a blow could fall so that upon these occasions
he always laid down his pipe upon the table with more fire to defend
himself than common

I told the reader this time two years that my uncle Toby was not
eloquent and in the very same page gave an instance to the contraryI
repeat the observation and a fact which contradicts it againHe
was not eloquentit was not easy to my uncle Toby to make long
haranguesand he hated florid ones but there were occasions where the
stream overflowed the man and ran so counter to its usual course
that in some parts my uncle Toby for a time was at least equal to
Tertullusbut in others in my own opinion infinitely above him

My father was so highly pleased with one of these apologetical orations
of my uncle Tobys which he had delivered one evening before him and
Yorick that he wrote it down before he went to bed

I have had the good fortune to meet with it amongst my fathers papers
with here and there an insertion of his own betwixt two crooks thus
  and is endorsed

My Brother Tobys Justification of His Own Principles and Conduct in
Wishing to Continue the War

I may safely say I have read over this apologetical oration of my uncle
Tobys a hundred times and think it so fine a model of defenceand
shews so sweet a temperament of gallantry and good principles in him
that I give it the world word for word interlineations and all as I
find it



Chapter 3LXXV

My Uncle Tobys Apologetical Oration

I am not insensible brother Shandy that when a man whose profession
is arms wishes as I have done for warit has an ill aspect to the
worldand that how just and right soever his motives the intentions
may behe stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating himself from
private views in doing it

For this cause if a soldier is a prudent man which he may be without
being a jot the less brave he will be sure not to utter his wish in
the hearing of an enemy for say what he will an enemy will not believe
himHe will be cautious of doing it even to a friendlest he may
suffer in his esteemBut if his heart is overcharged and a secret
sigh for arms must have its vent he will reserve it for the ear of
a brother who knows his character to the bottom and what his true
notions dispositions and principles of honour are What I hope I
have been in all these brother Shandy would be unbecoming in me to
saymuch worse I know have I been than I oughtand something
worse perhaps than I think But such as I am you my dear brother
Shandy who have sucked the same breasts with meand with whom I have
been brought up from my cradleand from whose knowledge from the
first hours of our boyish pastimes down to this I have concealed
no one action of my life and scarce a thought in itSuch as I am
brother you must by this time know me with all my vices and with
all my weaknesses too whether of my age my temper my passions or my
understanding

Tell me then my dear brother Shandy upon which of them it is that
when I condemned the peace of Utrecht and grieved the war was not
carried on with vigour a little longer you should think your brother
did it upon unworthy views or that in wishing for war he should be bad
enough to wish more of his fellowcreatures slainmore slaves made
and more families driven from their peaceful habitations merely for his
own pleasureTell me brother Shandy upon what one deed of mine do
you ground it The devil a deed do I know of dear Toby but one for a
hundred pounds which I lent thee to carry on these cursed sieges

If when I was a schoolboy I could not hear a drum beat but my heart
beat with itwas it my faultDid I plant the propensity thereDid I
sound the alarm within or Nature

When Guy Earl of Warwick and Parismus and Parismenus and Valentine
and Orson and the Seven Champions of England were handed around the
schoolwere they not all purchased with my own pocketmoney Was that
selfish brother Shandy When we read over the siege of Troy which
lasted ten years and eight monthsthough with such a train of
artillery as we had at Namur the town might have been carried in a
weekwas I not as much concerned for the destruction of the Greeks and
Trojans as any boy of the whole school Had I not three strokes of a
ferula given me two on my right hand and one on my left for calling
Helena a bitch for it Did any one of you shed more tears for Hector
And when king Priam came to the camp to beg his body and returned
weeping back to Troy without ityou know brother I could not eat my
dinner

Did that bespeak me cruel Or because brother Shandy my blood flew
out into the camp and my heart panted for warwas it a proof it could
not ache for the distresses of war too

O brother tis one thing for a soldier to gather laurelsand tis
another to scatter cypressWho told thee my dear Toby that cypress
was used by the antients on mournful occasions

Tis one thing brother Shandy for a soldier to hazard his own
lifeto leap first down into the trench where he is sure to be cut in
piecesTis one thing from public spirit and a thirst of glory to
enter the breach the first manto stand in the foremost rank and
march bravely on with drums and trumpets and colours flying about his
earsTis one thing I say brother Shandy to do thisand
tis another thing to reflect on the miseries of warto view the
desolations of whole countries and consider the intolerable fatigues
and hardships which the soldier himself the instrument who works them
is forced for sixpence a day if he can get it to undergo

Need I be told dear Yorick as I was by you in Le Fevers funeral
sermon That so soft and gentle a creature born to love to mercy and
kindness as man is was not shaped for thisBut why did you not add
Yorickif not by Naturethat he is so by NecessityFor what is war
what is it Yorick when fought as ours has been upon principles of
liberty and upon principles of honourwhat is it but the getting
together of quiet and harmless people with their swords in their hands
to keep the ambitious and the turbulent within bounds And heaven is
my witness brother Shandy that the pleasure I have taken in these
thingsand that infinite delight in particular which has attended
my sieges in my bowlinggreen has arose within me and I hope in the
corporal too from the consciousness we both had that in carrying them
on we were answering the great ends of our creation



Chapter 3LXXVI

I told the Christian readerI say Christianhoping he is oneand if
he is not I am sorry for itand only beg he will consider the matter
with himself and not lay the blame entirely upon this book

I told him Sirfor in good truth when a man is telling a story in the
strange way I do mine he is obliged continually to be going backwards
and forwards to keep all tight together in the readers fancywhich
for my own part if I did not take heed to do more than at first there
is so much unfixed and equivocal matter starting up with so many breaks
and gaps in itand so little service do the stars afford which
nevertheless I hang up in some of the darkest passages knowing that
the world is apt to lose its way with all the lights the sun itself at
noonday can give itand now you see I am lost myself

But tis my fathers fault and whenever my brains come to be
dissected you will perceive without spectacles that he has left a
large uneven thread as you sometimes see in an unsaleable piece of
cambrick running along the whole length of the web and so untowardly
you cannot so much as cut out a here I hang up a couple of lights
againor a fillet or a thumbstall but it is seen or felt

Quanto id diligentias in liberis procreandis cavendum sayeth Cardan
All which being considered and that you see tis morally impracticable
for me to wind this round to where I set out

I begin the chapter over again



Chapter 3LXXVII

I told the Christian reader in the beginning of the chapter which
preceded my uncle Tobys apologetical orationthough in a different
trope from what I should make use of now That the peace of Utrecht was
within an ace of creating the same shyness betwixt my uncle Toby and
his hobbyhorse as it did betwixt the queen and the rest of the
confederating powers

There is an indignant way in which a man sometimes dismounts his horse
which as good as says to him Ill go afoot Sir all the days of my
life before I would ride a single mile upon your back again Now my
uncle Toby could not be said to dismount his horse in this manner for
in strictness of language he could not be said to dismount his horse at
allhis horse rather flung himand somewhat viciously which made my
uncle Toby take it ten times more unkindly Let this matter be settled
by statejockies as they likeIt created I say a sort of shyness
betwixt my uncle Toby and his hobbyhorseHe had no occasion for him
from the month of March to November which was the summer after the
articles were signed except it was now and then to take a short ride
out just to see that the fortifications and harbour of Dunkirk were
demolished according to stipulation

The French were so backwards all that summer in setting about that
affair and Monsieur Tugghe the deputy from the magistrates of Dunkirk
presented so many affecting petitions to the queenbeseeching her
majesty to cause only her thunderbolts to fall upon the martial works
which might have incurred her displeasurebut to spareto spare the
mole for the moles sake which in its naked situation could be no
more than an object of pityand the queen who was but a woman being
of a pitiful dispositionand her ministers also they not wishing
in their hearts to have the town dismantled for these private
reasons so that the whole went heavily on with my uncle Toby
insomuch that it was not within three full months after he and the
corporal had constructed the town and put it in a condition to be
destroyed that the several commandants commissaries deputies
negociators and intendants would permit him to set about itFatal
interval of inactivity

The corporal was for beginning the demolition by making a breach in the
ramparts or main fortifications of the townNothat will never do
corporal said my uncle Toby for in going that way to work with the
town the English garrison will not be safe in it an hour because
if the French are treacherousThey are as treacherous as devils an
please your honour said the corporalIt gives me concern always when
I hear it Trim said my uncle Tobyfor they dont want personal
bravery and if a breach is made in the ramparts they may enter it and
make themselves masters of the place when they pleaseLet them enter
it said the corporal lifting up his pioneers spade in both his hands
as if he was going to lay about him with itlet them enter an please
your honour if they dareIn cases like this corporal said my
uncle Toby slipping his right hand down to the middle of his cane
and holding it afterwards truncheonwise with his forefinger
extendedtis no part of the consideration of a commandant what the
enemy dareor what they dare not do he must act with prudence We
will begin with the outworks both towards the sea and the land and
particularly with fort Louis the most distant of them all and demolish
it firstand the rest one by one both on our right and left as we
retreat towards the townthen well demolish the molenext fill up
the harbourthen retire into the citadel and blow it up into the air
and having done that corporal well embark for EnglandWe are there
quoth the corporal recollecting himselfVery true said my uncle
Tobylooking at the church



Chapter 3LXXVIII

A delusive delicious consultation or two of this kind betwixt my uncle
Toby and Trim upon the demolition of Dunkirkfor a moment rallied
back the ideas of those pleasures which were slipping from under
himstillstill all went on heavilythe magic left the mind the
weakerStillness with Silence at her back entered the solitary
parlour and drew their gauzy mantle over my uncle Tobys headand
Listlessness with her lax fibre and undirected eye sat quietly
down beside him in his armchairNo longer Amberg and Rhinberg and
Limbourg and Huy and Bonn in one yearand the prospect of Landen
and Trerebach and Drusen and Dendermond the nexthurried on the
bloodNo longer did saps and mines and blinds and gabions and
palisadoes keep out this fair enemy of mans reposeNo more could my
uncle Toby after passing the French lines as he eat his egg at supper
from thence break into the heart of Francecross over the Oyes and
with all Picardie open behind him march up to the gates of Paris and
fall asleep with nothing but ideas of gloryNo more was he to dream
he had fixed the royal standard upon the tower of the Bastile and awake
with it streaming in his head

Softer visionsgentler vibrations stole sweetly in upon his
slumbersthe trumpet of war fell out of his handshe took up the
lute sweet instrument of all others the most delicate the most
difficulthow wilt thou touch it my dear uncle Toby



Chapter 3LXXIX

Now because I have once or twice said in my inconsiderate way of
talking That I was confident the following memoirs of my uncle Tobys
courtship of widow Wadman whenever I got time to write them would
turn out one of the most complete systems both of the elementary and
practical part of love and lovemaking that ever was addressed to
the worldare you to imagine from thence that I shall set out with
a description of what love is whether part God and part Devil as
Plotinus will have it

Or by a more critical equation and supposing the whole of love to be
as tento determine with Ficinus How many parts of itthe oneand
how many the otheror whether it is all of it one great Devil from
head to tail as Plato has taken upon him to pronounce concerning which
conceit of his I shall not offer my opinionbut my opinion of Plato
is this that he appears from this instance to have been a man of much
the same temper and way of reasoning with doctor Baynyard who being a
great enemy to blisters as imagining that half a dozen of em at once
would draw a man as surely to his grave as a herse and sixrashly
concluded that the Devil himself was nothing in the world but one
great bouncing Cantharidis

I have nothing to say to people who allow themselves this monstrous
liberty in arguing but what Nazianzen cried out that is polemically
to Philagrius

Greek O rare tis fine reasoning Sir indeedGreek and most
nobly do you aim at truth when you philosophize about it in your moods
and passions

Nor is it to be imagined for the same reason I should stop to
inquire whether love is a diseaseor embroil myself with Rhasis and
Dioscorides whether the seat of it is in the brain or liverbecause
this would lead me on to an examination of the two very opposite
manners in which patients have been treatedthe one of Aoetius
who always begun with a cooling clyster of hempseed and bruised
cucumbersand followed on with thin potations of waterlilies and
purslaneto which he added a pinch of snuff of the herb Haneaand
where Aoetius durst venture ithis topazring

The other that of Gordonius who in his cap 15 de Amore directs
they should be thrashed ad putorem usquetill they stink again

These are disquisitions which my father who had laid in a great stock
of knowledge of this kind will be very busy with in the progress of
my uncle Tobys affairs I must anticipate thus much That from his
theories of love with which by the way he contrived to crucify my
uncle Tobys mind almost as much as his amours themselveshe took
a single step into practiceand by means of a camphorated cerecloth
which he found means to impose upon the taylor for buckram whilst he
was making my uncle Toby a new pair of breeches he produced Gordoniuss
effect upon my uncle Toby without the disgrace

What changes this produced will be read in its proper place all that
is needful to be added to the anecdote is thisThat whatever effect it
had upon my uncle Tobyit had a vile effect upon the houseand if my
uncle Toby had not smoaked it down as he did it might have had a vile
effect upon my father too



Chapter 3LXXX

Twill come out of itself by and byeAll I contend for is that I am
not obliged to set out with a definition of what love is and so long
as I can go on with my story intelligibly with the help of the word
itself without any other idea to it than what I have in common with
the rest of the world why should I differ from it a moment before the
timeWhen I can get on no furtherand find myself entangled on
all sides of this mystic labyrinthmy Opinion will then come in in
courseand lead me out

At present I hope I shall be sufficiently understood in telling the
reader my uncle Toby fell in love

Not that the phrase is at all to my liking for to say a man is fallen
in loveor that he is deeply in loveor up to the ears in loveand
sometimes even over head and ears in itcarries an idiomatical kind of
implication that love is a thing below a manthis is recurring again
to Platos opinion which with all his divinityshipI hold to be
damnable and hereticaland so much for that

Let love therefore be what it willmy uncle Toby fell into it

And possibly gentle reader with such a temptationso wouldst thou
For never did thy eyes behold or thy concupiscence covet any thing in
this world more concupiscible than widow Wadman

Was ever any thing in Nature so sweetso exquisite

Then dear Sir how could my uncle Toby resist it

Thrice happy book thou wilt have one page at least within thy covers
which Malice will not blacken and which Ignorance cannot misrepresent



Chapter 3LXXXII

As Susannah was informed by an express from Mrs Bridget of my
uncle Tobys falling in love with her mistress fifteen days before it
happenedthe contents of which express Susannah communicated to my
mother the next dayit has just given me an opportunity of entering
upon my uncle Tobys amours a fortnight before their existence

I have an article of news to tell you Mr Shandy quoth my mother
which will surprise you greatly

Now my father was then holding one of his second beds of justice and
was musing within himself about the hardships of matrimony as my mother
broke silence

My brother Toby quoth she is going to be married to Mrs Wadman

Then he will never quoth my father be able to lie diagonally in his
bed again as long as he lives

It was a consuming vexation to my father that my mother never asked the
meaning of a thing she did not understand

That she is not a woman of science my father would sayis her
misfortunebut she might ask a question

My mother never didIn short she went out of the world at last
without knowing whether it turned round or stood stillMy father had
officiously told her above a thousand times which way it wasbut she
always forgot

For these reasons a discourse seldom went on much further betwixt them
than a propositiona reply and a rejoinder at the end of which
it generally took breath for a few minutes as in the affair of the
breeches and then went on again

If he marries twill be the worse for usquoth my mother

Not a cherrystone said my fatherhe may as well batter away his
means upon that as any thing else

To be sure said my mother so here ended the propositionthe
replyand the rejoinder I told you of

It will be some amusement to him toosaid my father

A very great one answered my mother if he should have children

Lord have mercy upon mesaid my father to himself



Chapter 3LXXXIII

I am now beginning to get fairly into my work and by the help of a
vegetable diet with a few of the cold seeds I make no doubt but I
shall be able to go on with my uncle Tobys story and my own in a
tolerable straight line Now

four very squiggly lines across the page signed InvTS and ScwTS

These were the four lines I moved in through my first second third
and fourth volumes Alluding to the first editionIn the fifth volume
I have been very goodthe precise line I have described in it being
this

one very squiggly line across the page with loops marked
ABCCCCCD

By which it appears that except at the curve marked A where I took
a trip to Navarreand the indented curve B which is the short airing
when I was there with the Lady Baussiere and her pageI have not taken
the least frisk of a digression till John de la Casses devils led me
the round you see marked Dfor as for C C C C C they are nothing but
parentheses and the common ins and outs incident to the lives of
the greatest ministers of state and when compared with what men have
doneor with my own transgressions at the letters ABDthey vanish
into nothing

In this last volume I have done better stillfor from the end of Le
Fevers episode to the beginning of my uncle Tobys campaignsI have
scarce stepped a yard out of my way

If I mend at this rate it is not impossibleby the good leave of
his grace of Beneventos devilsbut I may arrive hereafter at the
excellency of going on even thus

straight line across the page

which is a line drawn as straight as I could draw it by a
writingmasters ruler borrowed for that purpose turning neither to
the right hand or to the left

This right linethe pathway for Christians to walk in say divines

The emblem of moral rectitude says Cicero

The best line say cabbage plantersis the shortest line says
Archimedes which can be drawn from one given point to another

I wish your ladyships would lay this matter to heart in your next
birthday suits

What a journey

Pray can you tell methat is without anger before I write my chapter
upon straight linesby what mistakewho told them soor how it has
come to pass that your men of wit and genius have all along confounded
this line with the line of Gravitation



Chapter 3LXXXIV

NoI think I said I would write two volumes every year provided the
vile cough which then tormented me and which to this hour I dread worse
than the devil would but give me leaveand in another placebut
where I cant recollect now speaking of my book as a machine and
laying my pen and ruler down crosswise upon the table in order to gain
the greater credit to itI swore it should be kept a going at that rate
these forty years if it pleased but the fountain of life to bless me so
long with health and good spirits

Now as for my spirits little have I to lay to their chargenay so very
little unless the mounting me upon a long stick and playing the fool
with me nineteen hours out of the twentyfour be accusations that on
the contrary I have muchmuch to thank em for cheerily have ye made
me tread the path of life with all the burthens of it except its cares
upon my back in no one moment of my existence that I remember have
ye once deserted me or tinged the objects which came in my way either
with sable or with a sickly green in dangers ye gilded my horizon with
hope and when Death himself knocked at my doorye bad him come again
and in so gay a tone of careless indifference did ye do it that he
doubted of his commission

There must certainly be some mistake in this matter quoth he

Now there is nothing in this world I abominate worse than to be
interrupted in a storyand I was that moment telling Eugenius a most
tawdry one in my way of a nun who fancied herself a shellfish and of
a monk damnd for eating a muscle and was shewing him the grounds and
justice of the procedure

Did ever so grave a personage get into so vile a scrape quoth
Death Thou hast had a narrow escape Tristram said Eugenius taking
hold of my hand as I finished my story

But there is no living Eugenius replied I at this rate for as this
son of a whore has found out my lodgings

You call him rightly said Eugeniusfor by sin we are told he
enterd the worldI care not which way he enterd quoth I provided he
be not in such a hurry to take me out with himfor I have forty volumes
to write and forty thousand things to say and do which no body in the
world will say and do for me except thyself and as thou seest he has
got me by the throat for Eugenius could scarce hear me speak across
the table and that I am no match for him in the open field had I not
better whilst these few scatterd spirits remain and these two spider
legs of mine holding one of them up to him are able to support
mehad I not better Eugenius fly for my life Tis my advice my
dear Tristram said EugeniusThen by heaven I will lead him a dance
he little thinks offor I will gallop quoth I without looking once
behind me to the banks of the Garonne and if I hear him clattering at
my heelsIll scamper away to mount Vesuviusfrom thence to Joppa and
from Joppa to the worlds end where if he follows me I pray God he
may break his neck

He runs more risk there said Eugenius than thou

Eugeniuss wit and affection brought blood into the cheek from whence it
had been some months banishdtwas a vile moment to bid adieu in he
led me to my chaiseAllons said I the postboy gave a crack with
his whipoff I went like a cannon and in half a dozen bounds got into
Dover



Chapter 3LXXXV

Now hang it quoth I as I lookd towards the French coasta man should
know something of his own country too before he goes abroadand I
never gave a peep into Rochester church or took notice of the dock of
Chatham or visited St Thomas at Canterbury though they all three laid
in my way

But mine indeed is a particular case

So without arguing the matter further with Thomas oBecket or any one
elseI skipd into the boat and in five minutes we got under sail and
scudded away like the wind

Pray captain quoth I as I was going down into the cabin is a man
never overtaken by Death in this passage

Why there is not time for a man to be sick in it replied heWhat
a cursed lyar for I am sick as a horse quoth I alreadywhat a
brainupside downheyday the cells are broke loose one into
another and the blood and the lymph and the nervous juices with the
fixd and volatile salts are all jumbled into one massgood G every
thing turns round in it like a thousand whirlpoolsId give a shilling
to know if I shant write the clearer for it

Sick sick sick sick

When shall we get to land captainthey have hearts like stonesO
I am deadly sickreach me that thing boytis the most discomfiting
sicknessI wish I was at the bottomMadam how is it with you Undone
undone unO undone sirWhat the first timeNo tis the
second third sixth tenth time sirheydaywhat a trampling over
headhollo cabin boy whats the matter

The wind choppd about sDeaththen I shall meet him full in the face

What lucktis choppd about again masterO the devil chop it

Captain quoth she for heavens sake let us get ashore



Chapter 3LXXXVI

It is a great inconvenience to a man in a haste that there are three
distinct roads between Calais and Paris in behalf of which there is so
much to be said by the several deputies from the towns which lie along
them that half a day is easily lost in settling which youll take

First the road by Lisle and Arras which is the most aboutbut most
interesting and instructing

The second that by Amiens which you may go if you would see
Chantilly

And that by Beauvais which you may go if you will

For this reason a great many chuse to go by Beauvais



Chapter 3LXXXVII

Now before I quit Calais a travelwriter would say it would not be
amiss to give some account of itNow I think it very much amissthat
a man cannot go quietly through a town and let it alone when it does
not meddle with him but that he must be turning about and drawing his
pen at every kennel he crosses over merely o my conscience for the
sake of drawing it because if we may judge from what has been wrote of
these things by all who have wrote and gallopdor who have gallopd
and wrote which is a different way still or who for more expedition
than the rest have wrote galloping which is the way I do at
presentfrom the great Addison who did it with his satchel of school
books hanging at his a and galling his beasts crupper at every
strokethere is not a gallopper of us all who might not have gone on
ambling quietly in his own ground in case he had any and have wrote
all he had to write dryshod as well as not

For my own part as heaven is my judge and to which I shall ever make
my last appealI know no more of Calais except the little my barber
told me of it as he was whetting his razor than I do this moment of
Grand Cairo for it was dusky in the evening when I landed and dark as
pitch in the morning when I set out and yet by merely knowing what
is what and by drawing this from that in one part of the town and by
spelling and putting this and that together in anotherI would lay any
travelling odds that I this moment write a chapter upon Calais as long
as my arm and with so distinct and satisfactory a detail of every item
which is worth a strangers curiosity in the townthat you would take
me for the townclerk of Calais itselfand where sir would be
the wonder was not Democritus who laughed ten times more than
Itownclerk of Abdera and was not I forget his name who had more
discretion than us both townclerk of Ephesusit should be pennd
moreover sir with so much knowledge and good sense and truth and
precision

Nayif you dont believe me you may read the chapter for your pains



Chapter 3LXXXVIII

Calais Calatium Calusium Calesium

This town if we may trust its archives the authority of which I see no
reason to call in question in this placewas once no more than a small
village belonging to one of the first Counts de Guignes and as it
boasts at present of no less than fourteen thousand inhabitants
exclusive of four hundred and twenty distinct families in the basse
ville or suburbsit must have grown up by little and little I
suppose to its present size

Though there are four convents there is but one parochial church in the
whole town I had not an opportunity of taking its exact dimensions but
it is pretty easy to make a tolerable conjecture of emfor as there
are fourteen thousand inhabitants in the town if the church holds them
all it must be considerably largeand if it will nottis a very
great pity they have not anotherit is built in form of a cross and
dedicated to the Virgin Mary the steeple which has a spire to it is
placed in the middle of the church and stands upon four pillars elegant
and light enough but sufficiently strong at the same timeit is
decorated with eleven altars most of which are rather fine than
beautiful The great altar is a masterpiece in its kind tis of white
marble and as I was told near sixty feet highhad it been much
higher it had been as high as mount Calvary itselftherefore I
suppose it must be high enough in all conscience

There was nothing struck me more than the great Square tho I cannot
say tis either well paved or well built but tis in the heart of the
town and most of the streets especially those in that quarter all
terminate in it could there have been a fountain in all Calais
which it seems there cannot as such an object would have been a great
ornament it is not to be doubted but that the inhabitants would have
had it in the very centre of this squarenot that it is properly a
squarebecause tis forty feet longer from east to west than from
north to south so that the French in general have more reason on their
side in calling them Places than Squares which strictly speaking to
be sure they are not

The townhouse seems to be but a sorry building and not to be kept in
the best repair otherwise it had been a second great ornament to this
place it answers however its destination and serves very well for the
reception of the magistrates who assemble in it from time to time so
that tis presumable justice is regularly distributed

I have heard much of it but there is nothing at all curious in the
Courgain tis a distinct quarter of the town inhabited solely by
sailors and fishermen it consists of a number of small streets neatly
built and mostly of brick tis extremely populous but as that may
be accounted for from the principles of their dietthere is nothing
curious in that neitherA traveller may see it to satisfy himselfhe
must not omit however taking notice of La Tour de Guet upon any
account tis so called from its particular destination because in war
it serves to discover and give notice of the enemies which approach the
place either by sea or landbut tis monstrous high and catches the
eye so continually you cannot avoid taking notice of it if you would

It was a singular disappointment to me that I could not have permission
to take an exact survey of the fortifications which are the strongest
in the world and which from first to last that is for the time they
were set about by Philip of France Count of Bologne to the present
war wherein many reparations were made have cost as I learned
afterwards from an engineer in Gasconyabove a hundred millions of
livres It is very remarkable that at the Tete de Gravelenes and where
the town is naturally the weakest they have expended the most money
so that the outworks stretch a great way into the campaign and
consequently occupy a large tract of groundHowever after all that is
said and done it must be acknowledged that Calais was never upon any
account so considerable from itself as from its situation and that
easy entrance which it gave our ancestors upon all occasions into
France it was not without its inconveniences also being no less
troublesome to the English in those times than Dunkirk has been to
us in ours so that it was deservedly looked upon as the key to both
kingdoms which no doubt is the reason that there have arisen so many
contentions who should keep it of these the siege of Calais or rather
the blockade for it was shut up both by land and sea was the most
memorable as it withstood the efforts of Edward the Third a whole
year and was not terminated at last but by famine and extreme misery
the gallantry of Eustace de St Pierre who first offered himself a
victim for his fellowcitizens has rankd his name with heroes As it
will not take up above fifty pages it would be injustice to the reader
not to give him a minute account of that romantic transaction as well
as of the siege itself in Rapins own words



Chapter 3LXXXIX

But courage gentle readerI scorn ittis enough to have thee in
my powerbut to make use of the advantage which the fortune of the pen
has now gained over thee would be too muchNo by that allpowerful
fire which warms the visionary brain and lights the spirits through
unworldly tracts ere I would force a helpless creature upon this hard
service and make thee pay poor soul for fifty pages which I have no
right to sell theenaked as I am I would browse upon the mountains
and smile that the north wind brought me neither my tent or my supper

So put on my brave boy and make the best of thy way to Boulogne



Chapter 3XC

Boulognehahso we are all got togetherdebtors and sinners before

Chapter 3XCI

When the precipitancy of a mans wishes hurries on his ideas ninety
times faster than the vehicle he rides inwoe be to truth and woe be
to the vehicle and its tackling let em be made of what stuff you will
upon which he breathes forth the disappointment of his soul

As I never give general characters either of men or things in choler
the most haste the worse speed was all the reflection I made upon
the affair the first time it happendthe second third fourth and
fifth time I confined it respectively to those times and accordingly
blamed only the second third fourth and fifth postboy for it
without carrying my reflections further but the event continuing to
befal me from the fifth to the sixth seventh eighth ninth and
tenth time and without one exception I then could not avoid making a
national reflection of it which I do in these words

That something is always wrong in a French postchaise upon first
setting out

Or the proposition may stand thus

A French postilion has always to alight before he has got three hundred
yards out of town

Whats wrong nowDiablea ropes brokea knot has slipta
staples drawna bolts to whittlea tag a rag a jag a strap a
buckle or a buckles tongue want altering

Now true as all this is I never think myself impowered to excommunicate
thereupon either the postchaise or its drivernor do I take it
into my head to swear by the living G I would rather go afoot
ten thousand timesor that I will be damnd if ever I get into
anotherbut I take the matter coolly before me and consider that some
tag or rag or jag or bolt or buckle or buckles tongue will ever
be a wanting or want altering travel where I willso I never chaff
but take the good and the bad as they fall in my road and get onDo
so my lad said I he had lost five minutes already in alighting in
order to get at a luncheon of black bread which he had crammd into the
chaisepocket and was remounted and going leisurely on to relish it
the betterGet on my lad said I brisklybut in the most persuasive
tone imaginable for I jingled a fourandtwenty sous piece against the
glass taking care to hold the flat side towards him as he lookd back
the dog grinnd intelligence from his right ear to his left and behind
his sooty muzzle discovered such a pearly row of teeth that Sovereignty
would have pawnd her jewels for them

Just heaven What masticatorsWhat bread

and so as he finished the last mouthful of it we entered the town of
Montreuil



Chapter 3XCII

There is not a town in all France which in my opinion looks better in
the map than MontreuilI own it does not look so well in the book
of postroads but when you come to see itto be sure it looks most
pitifully

There is one thing however in it at present very handsome and that
is the innkeepers daughter She has been eighteen months at Amiens
and six at Paris in going through her classes so knits and sews and
dances and does the little coquetries very well

A slut in running them over within these five minutes that I have
stood looking at her she has let fall at least a dozen loops in a white
thread stockingyes yesI see you cunning gipsytis long and
taperyou need not pin it to your kneeand that tis your ownand
fits you exactly

That Nature should have told this creature a word about a statues
thumb

But as this sample is worth all their thumbsbesides I have her
thumbs and fingers in at the bargain if they can be any guide to
meand as Janatone withal for that is her name stands so well for
a drawingmay I never draw more or rather may I draw like a
draughthorse by main strength all the days of my lifeif I do not
draw her in all her proportions and with as determined a pencil as if
I had her in the wettest drapery

But your worships chuse rather that I give you the length breadth
and perpendicular height of the great parishchurch or drawing of the
facade of the abbey of Saint Austreberte which has been transported
from Artois hitherevery thing is just I suppose as the masons and
carpenters left themand if the belief in Christ continues so long
will be so these fifty years to comeso your worships and reverences
may all measure them at your leisuresbut he who measures thee
Janatone must do it nowthou carriest the principles of change within
thy frame and considering the chances of a transitory life I would not
answer for thee a moment ere twice twelve months are passed and gone
thou mayest grow out like a pumpkin and lose thy shapesor thou mayest
go off like a flower and lose thy beautynay thou mayest go off like
a hussyand lose thyselfI would not answer for my aunt Dinah
was she alivefaith scarce for her picturewere it but painted by
Reynolds

But if I go on with my drawing after naming that son of Apollo Ill be
shot

So you must een be content with the original which if the evening is
fine in passing thro Montreuil you will see at your chaisedoor as
you change horses but unless you have as bad a reason for haste as I
haveyou had better stopShe has a little of the devote but that
sir is a terce to a nine in your favour L help me I could not
count a single point so had been piqued and repiqued and capotted to
the devil



Chapter 3XCIII

All which being considered and that Death moreover might be much nearer
me than I imaginedI wish I was at Abbeville quoth I were it only to
see how they card and spinso off we set

 but the carders and spinners were all gone to bed



Chapter 3XCIV

What a vast advantage is travelling only it heats one but there is a
remedy for that which you may pick out of the next chapter



Chapter 3XCV

Was I in a condition to stipulate with Death as I am this moment with
my apothecary how and where I will take his clysterI should certainly
declare against submitting to it before my friends and therefore
I never seriously think upon the mode and manner of this great
catastrophe which generally takes up and torments my thoughts as much
as the catastrophe itself but I constantly draw the curtain across it
with this wish that the Disposer of all things may so order it that
it happen not to me in my own housebut rather in some decent innat
home I know itthe concern of my friends and the last services of
wiping my brows and smoothing my pillow which the quivering hand of
pale affection shall pay me will so crucify my soul that I shall die
of a distemper which my physician is not aware of but in an inn the
few cold offices I wanted would be purchased with a few guineas and
paid me with an undisturbed but punctual attentionbut mark This inn
should not be the inn at Abbevilleif there was not another inn in the
universe I would strike that inn out of the capitulation so

Let the horses be in the chaise exactly by four in the morningYes
by four Siror by Genevieve Ill raise a clatter in the house shall
wake the dead



Chapter 3XCVI

Make them like unto a wheel is a bitter sarcasm as all the learned
know against the grand tour and that restless spirit for making it
which David prophetically foresaw would haunt the children of men in the
latter days and therefore as thinketh the great bishop Hall tis
one of the severest imprecations which David ever utterd against the
enemies of the Lordand as if he had said I wish them no worse luck
than always to be rolling aboutSo much motion continues he for he
was very corpulentis so much unquietness and so much of rest by the
same analogy is so much of heaven

Now I being very thin think differently and that so much of motion
is so much of life and so much of joyand that to stand still or get
on but slowly is death and the devil

Hollo Hothe whole worlds asleepbring out the horsesgrease the
wheelstie on the mailand drive a nail into that mouldingIll not
lose a moment

Now the wheel we are talking of and whereinto but not whereonto
for that would make an Ixions wheel of it he curseth his enemies
according to the bishops habit of body should certainly be a
postchaise wheel whether they were set up in Palestine at that time
or notand my wheel for the contrary reasons must as certainly be a
cartwheel groaning round its revolution once in an age and of which
sort were I to turn commentator I should make no scruple to affirm
they had great store in that hilly country

I love the Pythagoreans much more than ever I dare tell my dear Jenny
for their Greektheir getting out of the body in order to think
well No man thinks right whilst he is in it blinded as he must be
with his congenial humours and drawn differently aside as the bishop
and myself have been with too lax or too tense a fibreReason is half
of it Sense and the measure of heaven itself is but the measure of our
present appetites and concoctions

But which of the two in the present case do you think to be mostly
in the wrong

You certainly quoth she to disturb a whole family so early



Chapter 3XCVII

But she did not know I was under a vow not to shave my beard till I
got to Parisyet I hate to make mysteries of nothingtis the cold
cautiousness of one of those little souls from which Lessius lib 13
de moribus divinis cap 24 hath made his estimate wherein he setteth
forth That one Dutch mile cubically multiplied will allow room
enough and to spare for eight hundred thousand millions which he
supposes to be as great a number of souls counting from the fall of
Adam as can possibly be damnd to the end of the world

From what he has made this second estimateunless from the parental
goodness of GodI dont knowI am much more at a loss what could be in
Franciscus Ribberas head who pretends that no less a space than one of
two hundred Italian miles multiplied into itself will be sufficient to
hold the like numberhe certainly must have gone upon some of the old
Roman souls of which he had read without reflecting how much by a
gradual and most tabid decline in the course of eighteen hundred years
they must unavoidably have shrunk so as to have come when he wrote
almost to nothing

In Lessiuss time who seems the cooler man they were as little as can
be imagined

We find them less now

And next winter we shall find them less again so that if we go on from
little to less and from less to nothing I hesitate not one moment to
affirm that in half a century at this rate we shall have no souls
at all which being the period beyond which I doubt likewise of the
existence of the Christian faith twill be one advantage that both of
em will be exactly worn out together

Blessed Jupiter and blessed every other heathen god and goddess
for now ye will all come into play again and with Priapus at your
tailswhat jovial timesbut where am I and into what a delicious
riot of things am I rushing II who must be cut short in the midst
of my days and taste no more of em than what I borrow from my
imaginationpeace to thee generous fool and let me go on



Chapter 3XCVIII

So hating I say to make mysteries of nothingI intrusted it with
the postboy as soon as ever I got off the stones he gave a crack with
his whip to balance the compliment and with the thillhorse trotting
and a sort of an up and a down of the other we danced it along to Ailly
au clochers famed in days of yore for the finest chimes in the world
but we danced through it without musicthe chimes being greatly out of
orderas in truth they were through all France

And so making all possible speed from

Ailly au clochers I got to Hixcourt from Hixcourt I got to Pequignay
and from Pequignay I got to Amiens concerning which town I have
nothing to inform you but what I have informed you once beforeand
that wasthat Janatone went there to school



Chapter 3XCIX

In the whole catalogue of those whiffling vexations which come
puffing across a mans canvass there is not one of a more teasing
and tormenting nature than this particular one which I am going to
describeand for which unless you travel with an avancecourier which
numbers do in order to prevent itthere is no help and it is this

That be you in never so kindly a propensity to sleepthough you are
passing perhaps through the finest countryupon the best roads and in
the easiest carriage for doing it in the worldnay was you sure you
could sleep fifty miles straight forwards without once opening your
eyesnay what is more was you as demonstratively satisfied as you can
be of any truth in Euclid that you should upon all accounts be full as
well asleep as awakenay perhaps betterYet the incessant returns of
paying for the horses at every stagewith the necessity thereupon of
putting your hand into your pocket and counting out from thence three
livres fifteen sous sous by sous puts an end to so much of the
project that you cannot execute above six miles of it or supposing it
is a post and a half that is but ninewere it to save your soul from
destruction

Ill be even with em quoth I for Ill put the precise sum into a
piece of paper and hold it ready in my hand all the way Now I shall
have nothing to do said I composing myself to rest but to drop
this gently into the postboys hat and not say a wordThen there
wants two sous more to drinkor there is a twelve sous piece of Louis
XIV which will not passor a livre and some odd liards to be brought
over from the last stage which Monsieur had forgot which altercations
as a man cannot dispute very well asleep rouse him still is sweet
sleep retrievable and still might the flesh weigh down the spirit and
recover itself of these blowsbut then by heaven you have paid but
for a single postwhereas tis a post and a half and this obliges
you to pull out your book of postroads the print of which is so very
small it forces you to open your eyes whether you will or no Then
Monsieur le Cure offers you a pinch of snuffor a poor soldier shews
you his legor a shaveling his boxor the priestesse of the cistern
will water your wheelsthey do not want itbut she swears by her
priesthood throwing it back that they dothen you have all these
points to argue or consider over in your mind in doing of which the
rational powers get so thoroughly awakenedyou may get em to sleep
again as you can

It was entirely owing to one of these misfortunes or I had passd clean
by the stables of Chantilly

But the postillion first affirming and then persisting in it to my
face that there was no mark upon the two sous piece I opend my eyes
to be convincedand seeing the mark upon it as plain as my noseI
leapd out of the chaise in a passion and so saw every thing at
Chantilly in spiteI tried it but for three posts and a half but
believe tis the best principle in the world to travel speedily upon
for as few objects look very inviting in that moodyou have little or
nothing to stop you by which means it was that I passed through St
Dennis without turning my head so much as on one side towards the
Abby

Richness of their treasury stuff and nonsensebating their jewels
which are all false I would not give three sous for any one thing in
it but Jaidass lanternnor for that either only as it grows dark it
might be of use



Chapter 3C

Crack crackcrack crackcrack crackso this is Paris quoth I
continuing in the same moodand this is ParishumphParis cried
I repeating the name the third time

The first the finest the most brilliant

The streets however are nasty

But it looks I suppose better than it smellscrack crackcrack
crackwhat a fuss thou makestas if it concerned the good people to
be informed that a man with pale face and clad in black had the honour
to be driven into Paris at nine oclock at night by a postillion in a
tawny yellow jerkin turned up with red calamancocrack crackcrack
crackcrack crackI wish thy whip

But tis the spirit of thy nation so crackcrack on

Haand no one gives the wallbut in the School of Urbanity herself
if the walls are beshthow can you do otherwise

And prithee when do they light the lamps Whatnever in the summer
monthsHo tis the time of salladsO rare sallad and soupsoup
and salladsallad and soup encore

Tis too much for sinners

Now I cannot bear the barbarity of it how can that unconscionable
coachman talk so much bawdy to that lean horse dont you see friend
the streets are so villanously narrow that there is not room in all
Paris to turn a wheelbarrow In the grandest city of the whole world it
would not have been amiss if they had been left a thought wider nay
were it only so much in every single street as that a man might know
was it only for satisfaction on which side of it he was walking

OnetwothreefourfivesixseveneightninetenTen cooks
shops and twice the number of barbers and all within three minutes
driving one would think that all the cooks in the world on some great
merrymeeting with the barbers by joint consent had saidCome let
us all go live at Paris the French love good eatingthey are all
gourmandswe shall rank high if their god is their bellytheir cooks
must be gentlemen and forasmuch as the periwig maketh the man and the
periwigmaker maketh the periwigergo would the barbers say we shall
rank higher stillwe shall be above you allwe shall be Capitouls
Chief Magistrate in Toulouse c c c at leastpardi we shall
all wear swords

And so one would swear that is by candlelightbut there is no
depending upon it they continued to do to this day



Chapter 3CI

The French are certainly misunderstoodbut whether the fault is
theirs in not sufficiently explaining themselves or speaking with that
exact limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such
importance and which moreover is so likely to be contested by
usor whether the fault may not be altogether on our side in not
understanding their language always so critically as to know what they
would be atI shall not decide but tis evident to me when they
affirm That they who have seen Paris have seen every thing they
must mean to speak of those who have seen it by daylight

As for candlelightI give it upI have said before there was no
depending upon itand I repeat it again but not because the lights and
shades are too sharpor the tints confoundedor that there is neither
beauty or keeping cfor thats not truthbut it is an uncertain
light in this respect That in all the five hundred grand Hotels which
they number up to you in Parisand the five hundred good things at a
modest computation for tis only allowing one good thing to a Hotel
which by candlelight are best to be seen felt heard and understood
which by the bye is a quotation from Lillythe devil a one of us
out of fifty can get our heads fairly thrust in amongst them

This is no part of the French computation tis simply this

That by the last survey taken in the year one thousand seven hundred and
sixteen since which time there have been considerable augmentations
Paris doth contain nine hundred streets viz

 In the quarter called the Citythere are fiftythree streets
 In St James of the Shambles fiftyfive streets
 In St Oportune thirtyfour streets
 In the quarter of the Louvre twentyfive streets
 In the Palace Royal or St Honorius fortynine streets
 In Mont Martyr fortyone streets
 In St Eustace twentynine streets
 In the Halles twentyseven streets
 In St Dennis fiftyfive streets
 In St Martin fiftyfour streets
 In St Paul or the Mortellerie twentyseven streets
 The Greve thirtyeight streets
 In St Avoy or the Verrerie nineteen streets
 In the Marais or the Temple fiftytwo streets
 In St Antonys sixtyeight streets
 In the Place Maubert eightyone streets
 In St Bennet sixty streets
 In St Andrews de Arcs fiftyone streets
 In the quarter of the Luxembourg sixtytwo streets

And in that of St Germain fiftyfive streets into any of which you
may walk and that when you have seen them with all that belongs to
them fairly by daylighttheir gates their bridges their squares
their statuesand have crusaded it moreover through all their
parishchurches by no means omitting St Roche and Sulpiceand to
crown all have taken a walk to the four palaces which you may see
either with or without the statues and pictures just as you chuse

Then you will have seen

but tis what no one needeth to tell you for you will read of it
yourself upon the portico of the Louvre in these words

 Earth No Such FolksNo Folks Eer Such A Town
 As Paris IsSing Derry Derry Down
 Non orbis gentem non urbem gens habet ullam
 ulla parem

The French have a gay way of treating every thing that is Great and
that is all can be said upon it



Chapter 3CII

In mentioning the word gay as in the close of the last chapter it puts
one ie an author in mind of the word spleenespecially if he has
any thing to say upon it not that by any analysisor that from any
table of interest or genealogy there appears much more ground of
alliance betwixt them than betwixt light and darkness or any two of
the most unfriendly opposites in natureonly tis an undercraft of
authors to keep up a good understanding amongst words as politicians
do amongst mennot knowing how near they may be under a necessity of
placing them to each otherwhich point being now gaind and that I may
place mine exactly to my mind I write it down here

Spleen

This upon leaving Chantilly I declared to be the best principle in the
world to travel speedily upon but I gave it only as matter of opinion
I still continue in the same sentimentsonly I had not then experience
enough of its working to add this that though you do get on at a
tearing rate yet you get on but uneasily to yourself at the same
time for which reason I here quit it entirely and for ever and tis
heartily at any ones serviceit has spoiled me the digestion of a good
supper and brought on a bilious diarrhoea which has brought me back
again to my first principle on which I set outand with which I shall
now scamper it away to the banks of the Garonne

NoI cannot stop a moment to give you the character of the

A Dedication to a Great Man

Having a priori intended to dedicate The Amours of my Uncle Toby to
Mr I see more reasons a posteriori for doing it to Lord

I should lament from my soul if this exposed me to the jealousy of
their Reverences because a posteriori in Courtlatin signifies the
kissing hands for prefermentor any thing elsein order to get it

My opinion of Lord is neither better nor worse than it was of
Mr  Honours like impressions upon coin may give an ideal and
local value to a bit of base metal but Gold and Silver will pass all
the world over without any other recommendation than their own weight

The same goodwill that made me think of offering up half an hours
amusement to Mr when out of placeoperates more forcibly at
present as half an hours amusement will be more serviceable and
refreshing after labour and sorrow than after a philosophical repast

Nothing is so perfectly amusement as a total change of ideas no ideas
are so totally different as those of Ministers and innocent Lovers
for which reason when I come to talk of Statesmen and Patriots and set
such marks upon them as will prevent confusion and mistakes concerning
them for the futureI propose to dedicate that Volume to some gentle
Shepherd

 Whose thoughts proud Science never taught to stray
 Far as the Statesmans walk or Patriotway
 Yet simple Nature to his hopes had given
 Out of a cloudcappd head a humbler heaven
 Some untamd World in depths of wood embraced
 Some happier Island in the watrywaste
 And where admitted to that equal sky
 His faithful Dogs should bear him company

In a word by thus introducing an entire new set of objects to his
Imagination I shall unavoidably give a Diversion to his passionate and
lovesick Contemplations In the mean time

I am

Chapter 4I

Now I hate to hear a person especially if he be a traveller complain
that we do not get on so fast in France as we do in England whereas we
get on much faster consideratis considerandis thereby always meaning
that if you weigh their vehicles with the mountains of baggage which
you lay both before and behind upon themand then consider their puny
horses with the very little they give themtis a wonder they get on
at all their suffering is most unchristian and tis evident thereupon
to me that a French posthorse would not know what in the world to do
was it not for the two words and in which there is as much
sustenance as if you give him a peck of corn now as these words cost
nothing I long from my soul to tell the reader what they are but
here is the questionthey must be told him plainly and with the most
distinct articulation or it will answer no endand yet to do it
in that plain waythough their reverences may laugh at it in the
bedchamberfull well I wot they will abuse it in the parlour for
which cause I have been volving and revolving in my fancy some time
but to no purpose by what clean device or facette contrivance I might
so modulate them that whilst I satisfy that ear which the reader chuses
to lend meI might not dissatisfy the other which he keeps to himself

My ink burns my finger to tryand when I havetwill have a worse
consequenceIt will burn I fear my paper

NoI dare not

But if you wish to know how the abbess of Andouillets and a novice
of her convent got over the difficulty only first wishing myself all
imaginable successIll tell you without the least scruple



Chapter 4II

The abbess of Andouillets which if you look into the large set of
provincial maps now publishing at Paris you will find situated amongst
the hills which divide Burgundy from Savoy being in danger of an
Anchylosis or stiff joint the sinovia of her knee becoming hard by long
matins and having tried every remedyfirst prayers and thanksgiving
then invocations to all the saints in heaven promiscuouslythen
particularly to every saint who had ever had a stiff leg before
herthen touching it with all the reliques of the convent principally
with the thighbone of the man of Lystra who had been impotent from
his youththen wrapping it up in her veil when she went to bedthen
crosswise her rosarythen bringing in to her aid the secular arm and
anointing it with oils and hot fat of animalsthen treating it
with emollient and resolving fomentationsthen with poultices
of marshmallows mallows bonus Henricus white lillies and
fenugreekthen taking the woods I mean the smoak of em holding
her scapulary across her lapthen decoctions of wild chicory
watercresses chervil sweet cecily and cochleariaand nothing all
this while answering was prevailed on at last to try the hotbaths of
Bourbonso having first obtained leave of the visitorgeneral to take
care of her existenceshe ordered all to be got ready for her journey
a novice of the convent of about seventeen who had been troubled with
a whitloe in her middle finger by sticking it constantly into the
abbesss cast poultices chad gained such an interest that
overlooking a sciatical old nun who might have been set up for ever by
the hotbaths of Bourbon Margarita the little novice was elected as
the companion of the journey

An old calesh belonging to the abbesse lined with green frize was
ordered to be drawn out into the sunthe gardener of the convent being
chosen muleteer led out the two old mules to clip the hair from the
rumpends of their tails whilst a couple of laysisters were busied
the one in darning the lining and the other in sewing on the shreds
of yellow binding which the teeth of time had unravelledthe
undergardener dressd the muleteers hat in hot wineleesand a taylor
sat musically at it in a shed overagainst the convent in assorting
four dozen of bells for the harness whistling to each bell as he tied
it on with a thong

The carpenter and the smith of Andouillets held a council of wheels
and by seven the morning after all lookd spruce and was ready at
the gate of the convent for the hotbaths of Bourbontwo rows of the
unfortunate stood ready there an hour before

The abbess of Andouillets supported by Margarita the novice advanced
slowly to the calesh both clad in white with their black rosaries
hanging at their breasts

There was a simple solemnity in the contrast they entered the calesh
the nuns in the same uniform sweet emblem of innocence each occupied
a window and as the abbess and Margarita lookd upeach the sciatical
poor nun exceptedeach streamd out the end of her veil in the
airthen kissd the lilly hand which let it go the good abbess and
Margarita laid their hands saintwise upon their breastslookd up to
heaventhen to themand lookd God bless you dear sisters

I declare I am interested in this story and wish I had been there

The gardener whom I shall now call the muleteer was a little hearty
broadset goodnatured chattering toping kind of a fellow who
troubled his head very little with the hows and whens of life so had
mortgaged a month of his conventical wages in a borrachio or leathern
cask of wine which he had disposed behind the calesh with a large
russetcoloured ridingcoat over it to guard it from the sun and as
the weather was hot and he not a niggard of his labours walking ten
times more than he rodehe found more occasions than those of nature
to fall back to the rear of his carriage till by frequent coming and
going it had so happend that all his wine had leakd out at the legal
vent of the borrachio before one half of the journey was finishd

Man is a creature born to habitudes The day had been sultrythe
evening was deliciousthe wine was generousthe Burgundian hill on
which it grew was steepa little tempting bush over the door of a
cool cottage at the foot of it hung vibrating in full harmony with
the passionsa gentle air rustled distinctly through the
leavesComecome thirsty muleteercome in

The muleteer was a son of Adam I need not say a word more He gave
the mules each of em a sound lash and looking in the abbesss and
Margaritas faces as he did itas much as to say here I amhe
gave a second good crackas much as to say to his mules get onso
slinking behind he enterd the little inn at the foot of the hill

The muleteer as I told you was a little joyous chirping fellow who
thought not of tomorrow nor of what had gone before or what was to
follow it provided he got but his scantling of Burgundy and a little
chitchat along with it so entering into a long conversation as how
he was chief gardener to the convent of Andouillets c c and out of
friendship for the abbess and Mademoiselle Margarita who was only in
her noviciate he had come along with them from the confines of Savoy
c cand as how she had got a white swelling by her devotionsand
what a nation of herbs he had procured to mollify her humours c c
and that if the waters of Bourbon did not mend that legshe might
as well be lame of bothc c cHe so contrived his story as
absolutely to forget the heroine of itand with her the little novice
and what was a more ticklish point to be forgot than boththe two
mules who being creatures that take advantage of the world inasmuch
as their parents took it of themand they not being in a condition to
return the obligation downwards as men and women and beasts arethey
do it sideways and longways and backwaysand up hill and down
hill and which way they canPhilosophers with all their ethicks
have never considered this rightlyhow should the poor muleteer then
in his cups consider it at all he did not in the leasttis time we
do let us leave him then in the vortex of his element the happiest and
most thoughtless of mortal menand for a moment let us look after the
mules the abbess and Margarita

By virtue of the muleteers two last strokes the mules had gone quietly
on following their own consciences up the hill till they had conquerd
about one half of it when the elder of them a shrewd crafty old devil
at the turn of an angle giving a side glance and no muleteer behind
them

By my fig said she swearing Ill go no furtherAnd if I do replied
the other they shall make a drum of my hide

And so with one consent they stoppd thus

We are ruind and undone my child said the abbess to Margaritawe
shall be here all nightwe shall be plunderdwe shall be ravished

We shall be ravishd said Margarita as sure as a gun

Sancta Maria cried the abbess forgetting the Owhy was I governd
by this wicked stiff joint why did I leave the convent of Andouillets
and why didst thou not suffer thy servant to go unpolluted to her tomb

O my finger my finger cried the novice catching fire at the word
servantwhy was I not content to put it here or there any where
rather than be in this strait

one knew not what she saidthe other what she answerd

Chapter 4V

My dear mother quoth the novice coming a little to herselfthere are
two certain words which I have been told will force any horse or ass
or mule to go up a hill whether he will or no be he never so obstinate
or illwilld the moment he hears them utterd he obeys They
are words magic cried the abbess in the utmost horrorNo replied
Margarita calmlybut they are words sinfulWhat are they quoth the
abbess interrupting her They are sinful in the first degree answered
Margaritathey are mortaland if we are ravished and die unabsolved
of them we shall bothbut you may pronounce them to me quoth the
abbess of AndouilletsThey cannot my dear mother said the novice
be pronounced at all they will make all the blood in ones body fly up
into ones faceBut you may whisper them in my ear quoth the abbess

Heaven hadst thou no guardian angel to delegate to the inn at
the bottom of the hill was there no generous and friendly spirit
unemployedno agent in nature by some monitory shivering creeping
along the artery which led to his heart to rouse the muleteer from his
banquetno sweet minstrelsy to bring back the fair idea of the abbess
and Margarita with their black rosaries

Rouse rousebut tis too latethe horrid words are pronounced this
moment

and how to tell themYe who can speak of every thing existing with
unpolluted lipsinstruct meguide me



Chapter 4VI

All sins whatever quoth the abbess turning casuist in the distress
they were under are held by the confessor of our convent to be either
mortal or venial there is no further division Now a venial sin being
the slightest and least of all sinsbeing halvedby taking either only
the half of it and leaving the restor by taking it all and amicably
halving it betwixt yourself and another personin course becomes
diluted into no sin at all

Now I see no sin in saying bou bou bou bou bou a hundred times
together nor is there any turpitude in pronouncing the syllable ger
ger ger ger ger were it from our matins to our vespers Therefore
my dear daughter continued the abbess of AndouilletsI will say bou
and thou shalt say ger and then alternately as there is no more sin in
fou than in bouThou shalt say fouand I will come in like fa sol
la re mi ut at our complines with ter And accordingly the abbess
giving the pitch note set off thus

 Abbess Bouboubou
 Margarita gergerger

 Margarita Foufoufou
 Abbess terterter

The two mules acknowledged the notes by a mutual lash of their tails
but it went no furtherTwill answer by an by said the novice

 Abbess Bou bou bou bou bou bou

Quicker still cried Margarita Fou fou fou fou fou fou fou fou

Quicker still cried Margarita Bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou

Chapter 4VII

What a tract of country have I runhow many degrees nearer to the
warm sun am I advanced and how many fair and goodly cities have I seen
during the time you have been reading and reflecting Madam upon this
story Theres Fontainbleau and Sens and Joigny and Auxerre and
Dijon the capital of Burgundy and Challon and Macon the capital of the
Maconese and a score more upon the road to Lyonsand now I have run
them overI might as well talk to you of so many market towns in the
moon as tell you one word about them it will be this chapter at the
least if not both this and the next entirely lost do what I will

Why tis a strange story Tristram

Alas Madam had it been upon some melancholy lecture of the crossthe
peace of meekness or the contentment of resignationI had not been
incommoded or had I thought of writing it upon the purer abstractions
of the soul and that food of wisdom and holiness and contemplation
upon which the spirit of man when separated from the body is to
subsist for everYou would have come with a better appetite from it

I wish I never had wrote it but as I never blot any thing outlet us
use some honest means to get it out of our heads directly

Pray reach me my fools capI fear you sit upon it Madamtis under
the cushionIll put it on

Bless me you have had it upon your head this half hourThere then let
it stay with a

 Fara diddle di
 and a fari diddle d
 and a highdumdyedum
 fiddledumbc

And now Madam we may venture I hope a little to go on



Chapter 4VIII

All you need say of Fontainbleau in case you are askd is that it
stands about forty miles south something from Paris in the middle of
a large forestThat there is something great in itThat the king
goes there once every two or three years with his whole court for the
pleasure of the chaceand that during that carnival of sporting
any English gentleman of fashion you need not forget yourself may be
accommodated with a nag or two to partake of the sport taking care
only not to outgallop the king

Though there are two reasons why you need not talk loud of this to every
one

First Because twill make the said nags the harder to be got and

Secondly Tis not a word of it trueAllons

As for Sensyou may dispatchin a wordTis an archiepiscopal see

For Joignythe less I think one says of it the better

But for AuxerreI could go on for ever for in my grand tour through
Europe in which after all my father not caring to trust me with any
one attended me himself with my uncle Toby and Trim and Obadiah and
indeed most of the family except my mother who being taken up with
a project of knitting my father a pair of large worsted breechesthe
thing is common senseand she not caring to be put out of her way
she staid at home at Shandy Hall to keep things right during the
expedition in which I say my father stopping us two days at Auxerre
and his researches being ever of such a nature that they would have
found fruit even in a deserthe has left me enough to say upon Auxerre
in short wherever my father wentbut twas more remarkably so in
this journey through France and Italy than in any other stages of his
lifehis road seemed to lie so much on one side of that wherein all
other travellers have gone before himhe saw kings and courts and silks
of all colours in such strange lightsand his remarks and reasonings
upon the characters the manners and customs of the countries we passd
over were so opposite to those of all other mortal men particularly
those of my uncle Toby and Trimto say nothing of myselfand to
crown allthe occurrences and scrapes which we were perpetually meeting
and getting into in consequence of his systems and opiniotrythey were
of so odd so mixd and tragicomical a contextureThat the whole put
together it appears of so different a shade and tint from any tour of
Europe which was ever executedthat I will venture to pronouncethe
fault must be mine and mine onlyif it be not read by all travellers
and travelreaders till travelling is no moreor which comes to the
same pointtill the world finally takes it into its head to stand
still

But this rich bale is not to be opend now except a small thread or
two of it merely to unravel the mystery of my fathers stay at Auxerre

As I have mentioned ittis too slight to be kept suspended and when
tis wove in there is an end of it

Well go brother Toby said my father whilst dinner is coddlingto
the abbey of Saint Germain if it be only to see these bodies of which
Monsieur Sequier has given such a recommendationIll go see any body
quoth my uncle Toby for he was all compliance through every step of the
journeyDefend me said my fatherthey are all mummiesThen one need
not shave quoth my uncle TobyShave nocried my fathertwill be
more like relations to go with our beards onSo out we sallied the
corporal lending his master his arm and bringing up the rear to the
abbey of Saint Germain

Every thing is very fine and very rich and very superb and very
magnificent said my father addressing himself to the sacristan who
was a younger brother of the order of Benedictinesbut our curiosity
has led us to see the bodies of which Monsieur Sequier has given the
world so exact a descriptionThe sacristan made a bow and lighting a
torch first which he had always in the vestry ready for the purpose he
led us into the tomb of St HeribaldThis said the sacristan laying
his hand upon the tomb was a renowned prince of the house of Bavaria
who under the successive reigns of Charlemagne Louis le Debonnair
and Charles the Bald bore a great sway in the government and had a
principal hand in bringing every thing into order and discipline

Then he has been as great said my uncle in the field as in the
cabinetI dare say he has been a gallant soldierHe was a monksaid
the sacristan

My uncle Toby and Trim sought comfort in each others facesbut found
it not my father clapped both his hands upon his codpiece which was a
way he had when any thing hugely tickled him for though he hated a monk
and the very smell of a monk worse than all the devils in hellyet the
shot hitting my uncle Toby and Trim so much harder than him twas a
relative triumph and put him into the gayest humour in the world

And pray what do you call this gentleman quoth my father rather
sportingly This tomb said the young Benedictine looking downwards
contains the bones of Saint Maxima who came from Ravenna on purpose to
touch the body

Of Saint Maximus said my father popping in with his saint before
himthey were two of the greatest saints in the whole martyrology
added my fatherExcuse me said the sacristantwas to touch the bones
of Saint Germain the builder of the abbeyAnd what did she get by
it said my uncle TobyWhat does any woman get by it said my
fatherMartyrdome replied the young Benedictine making a bow down
to the ground and uttering the word with so humble but decisive a
cadence it disarmed my father for a moment Tis supposed continued
the Benedictine that St Maxima has lain in this tomb four hundred
years and two hundred before her canonizationTis but a slow rise
brother Toby quoth my father in this selfsame army of martyrsA
desperate slow one an please your honour said Trim unless one could
purchaseI should rather sell out entirely quoth my uncle TobyI am
pretty much of your opinion brother Toby said my father

Poor St Maxima said my uncle Toby low to himself as we turnd from
her tomb She was one of the fairest and most beautiful ladies either of
Italy or France continued the sacristanBut who the duce has got lain
down here besides her quoth my father pointing with his cane to
a large tomb as we walked onIt is Saint Optat Sir answered the
sacristanAnd properly is Saint Optat placd said my father And
what is Saint Optats story continued he Saint Optat replied the
sacristan was a bishop

I thought so by heaven cried my father interrupting himSaint
Optathow should Saint Optat fail so snatching out his pocketbook
and the young Benedictine holding him the torch as he wrote he set it
down as a new prop to his system of Christian names and I will be bold
to say so disinterested was he in the search of truth that had he
found a treasure in Saint Optats tomb it would not have made him half
so rich Twas as successful a short visit as ever was paid to the
dead and so highly was his fancy pleasd with all that had passed in
itthat he determined at once to stay another day in Auxerre

Ill see the rest of these good gentry tomorrow said my father as
we crossd over the squareAnd while you are paying that visit brother
Shandy quoth my uncle Tobythe corporal and I will mount the ramparts



Chapter 4IX

Now this is the most puzzled skein of allfor in this last chapter
as far at least as it has helpd me through Auxerre I have been getting
forwards in two different journies together and with the same dash of
the penfor I have got entirely out of Auxerre in this journey which
I am writing now and I am got half way out of Auxerre in that which I
shall write hereafterThere is but a certain degree of perfection in
every thing and by pushing at something beyond that I have brought
myself into such a situation as no traveller ever stood before me
for I am this moment walking across the marketplace of Auxerre with
my father and my uncle Toby in our way back to dinnerand I am this
moment also entering Lyons with my postchaise broke into a thousand
piecesand I am moreover this moment in a handsome pavillion built by
Pringello The same Don Pringello the celebrated Spanish architect of
whom my cousin Antony has made such honourable mention in a scholium to
the Tale inscribed to his name Vid p129 small edit upon the banks
of the Garonne which Mons Sligniac has lent me and where I now sit
rhapsodising all these affairs

Let me collect myself and pursue my journey



Chapter 4X

I am glad of it said I settling the account with myself as I walkd
into Lyonsmy chaise being all laid higgledypiggledy with my baggage
in a cart which was moving slowly before meI am heartily glad said
I that tis all broke to pieces for now I can go directly by water
to Avignon which will carry me on a hundred and twenty miles of my
journey and not cost me seven livresand from thence continued I
bringing forwards the account I can hire a couple of mulesor asses
if I like for nobody knows me and cross the plains of Languedoc for
almost nothingI shall gain four hundred livres by the misfortune clear
into my purse and pleasure worthworth double the money by it With
what velocity continued I clapping my two hands together shall I fly
down the rapid Rhone with the Vivares on my right hand and Dauphiny
on my left scarce seeing the ancient cities of Vienne Valence
and Vivieres What a flame will it rekindle in the lamp to snatch a
blushing grape from the Hermitage and Cote roti as I shoot by the foot
of them and what a fresh spring in the blood to behold upon the banks
advancing and retiring the castles of romance whence courteous knights
have whilome rescued the distressdand see vertiginous the rocks the
mountains the cataracts and all the hurry which Nature is in with all
her great works about her

As I went on thus methought my chaise the wreck of which lookd
stately enough at the first insensibly grew less and less in its
size the freshness of the painting was no morethe gilding lost its
lustreand the whole affair appeared so poor in my eyesso sorryso
contemptible and in a word so much worse than the abbess of
Andouillets itselfthat I was just opening my mouth to give it to the
devilwhen a pert vamping chaiseundertaker stepping nimbly across
the street demanded if Monsieur would have his chaise refittedNo
no said I shaking my head sidewaysWould Monsieur choose to sell
it rejoined the undertakerWith all my soul said Ithe iron work is
worth forty livresand the glasses worth forty moreand the leather
you may take to live on

What a mine of wealth quoth I as he counted me the money has this
postchaise brought me in And this is my usual method of bookkeeping
at least with the disasters of lifemaking a penny of every one of em
as they happen to me

Do my dear Jenny tell the world for me how I behaved under one the
most oppressive of its kind which could befal me as a man proud as he
ought to be of his manhood

Tis enough saidst thou coming close up to me as I stood with my
garters in my hand reflecting upon what had not passdTis enough
Tristram and I am satisfied saidst thou whispering these words in my
ear any other man would have sunk down
to the centre

Every thing is good for something quoth I

Ill go into Wales for six weeks and drink goats wheyand Ill
gain seven years longer life for the accident For which reason I think
myself inexcusable for blaming Fortune so often as I have done for
pelting me all my life long like an ungracious duchess as I calld
her with so many small evils surely if I have any cause to be angry
with her tis that she has not sent me great onesa score of good
cursed bouncing losses would have been as good as a pension to me

One of a hundred a year or so is all I wishI would not be at the
plague of paying landtax for a larger



Chapter 4XI

To those who call vexations Vexations as knowing what they are there
could not be a greater than to be the best part of a day at Lyons
the most opulent and flourishing city in France enriched with the most
fragments of antiquityand not be able to see it To be withheld upon
any account must be a vexation but to be withheld by a vexationmust
certainly be what philosophy justly calls Vexation upon Vexation

I had got my two dishes of milk coffee which by the bye is excellently
good for a consumption but you must boil the milk and coffee
togetherotherwise tis only coffee and milkand as it was no more
than eight in the morning and the boat did not go off till noon I had
time to see enough of Lyons to tire the patience of all the friends I
had in the world with it I will take a walk to the cathedral said I
looking at my list and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock
of Lippius of Basil in the first place

Now of all things in the world I understand the least of mechanismI
have neither genius or taste or fancyand have a brain so entirely
unapt for every thing of that kind that I solemnly declare I was never
yet able to comprehend the principles of motion of a squirrel cage or a
common knifegrinders wheeltho I have many an hour of my life lookd
up with great devotion at the oneand stood by with as much patience as
any christian ever could do at the other

Ill go see the surprising movements of this great clock said I the
very first thing I do and then I will pay a visit to the great library
of the Jesuits and procure if possible a sight of the thirty volumes
of the general history of China wrote not in the Tartarean but in
the Chinese language and in the Chinese character too

Now I almost know as little of the Chinese language as I do of the
mechanism of Lippiuss clockwork so why these should have jostled
themselves into the two first articles of my listI leave to the
curious as a problem of Nature I own it looks like one of her
ladyships obliquities and they who court her are interested in
finding out her humour as much as I

When these curiosities are seen quoth I half addressing myself to my
valet de place who stood behind metwill be no hurt if we go to the
church of St Irenaeus and see the pillar to which Christ was tiedand
after that the house where Pontius Pilate livedTwas at the next
town said the valet de placeat Vienne I am glad of it said I
rising briskly from my chair and walking across the room with strides
twice as long as my usual pacefor so much the sooner shall I be at
the Tomb of the two lovers

What was the cause of this movement and why I took such long strides in
uttering thisI might leave to the curious too but as no principle
of clockwork is concerned in ittwill be as well for the reader if I
explain it myself



Chapter 4XII

O there is a sweet aera in the life of man when the brain being
tender and fibrillous and more like pap than any thing elsea story
read of two fond lovers separated from each other by cruel parents and
by still more cruel destiny

 AmandusHe
 AmandaShe
 each ignorant of the others course
 Heeast
 Shewest

Amandus taken captive by the Turks and carried to the emperor of
Moroccos court where the princess of Morocco falling in love with him
keeps him twenty years in prison for the love of his Amanda

SheAmanda all the time wandering barefoot and with dishevelld
hair oer rocks and mountains enquiring for AmandusAmandus
Amandusmaking every hill and valley to echo back his nameAmandus
Amandus at every town and city sitting down forlorn at the gateHas
Amandushas my Amandus enterdtillgoing round and round and
round the worldchance unexpected bringing them at the same moment of
the night though by different ways to the gate of Lyons their native
city and each in wellknown accents calling out aloud

Is Amandus  Is my Amanda still alive

they fly into each others arms and both drop down dead for joy

There is a soft aera in every gentle mortals life where such a story
affords more pabulum to the brain than all the Frusts and Crusts and
Rusts of antiquity which travellers can cook up for it

Twas all that stuck on the right side of the cullender in my own of
what Spon and others in their accounts of Lyons had strained into it
and finding moreover in some Itinerary but in what God knowsThat
sacred to the fidelity of Amandus and Amanda a tomb was built without
the gates where to this hour lovers called upon them to attest their
truthsI never could get into a scrape of that kind in my life
but this tomb of the lovers would somehow or other come in at the
closenay such a kind of empire had it establishd over me that I
could seldom think or speak of Lyonsand sometimes not so much as see
even a Lyonswaistcoat but this remnant of antiquity would present
itself to my fancy and I have often said in my wild way of running
ontho I fear with some irreverenceI thought this shrine neglected
as it was as valuable as that of Mecca and so little short except in
wealth of the Santa Casa itself that some time or other I would go a
pilgrimage though I had no other business at Lyons on purpose to pay
it a visit

In my list therefore of Videnda at Lyons this tho lastwas not
you see least so taking a dozen or two of longer strides than usual
cross my room just whilst it passed my brain I walked down calmly
into the basse cour in order to sally forth and having called for my
billas it was uncertain whether I should return to my inn I had paid
ithad moreover given the maid ten sous and was just receiving the
dernier compliments of Monsieur Le Blanc for a pleasant voyage down the
Rhonewhen I was stopped at the gate



Chapter 4XIII

Twas by a poor ass who had just turned in with a couple of large
panniers upon his back to collect eleemosynary turniptops and
cabbageleaves and stood dubious with his two forefeet on the inside
of the threshold and with his two hinder feet towards the street as
not knowing very well whether he was to go in or no

Now tis an animal be in what hurry I may I cannot bear to
strikethere is a patient endurance of sufferings wrote so
unaffectedly in his looks and carriage which pleads so mightily for
him that it always disarms me and to that degree that I do not
like to speak unkindly to him on the contrary meet him where I
willwhether in town or countryin cart or under pannierswhether
in liberty or bondageI have ever something civil to say to him on my
part and as one word begets another if he has as little to do as
II generally fall into conversation with him and surely never is my
imagination so busy as in framing his responses from the etchings of his
countenanceand where those carry me not deep enoughin flying from my
own heart into his and seeing what is natural for an ass to thinkas
well as a man upon the occasion In truth it is the only creature
of all the classes of beings below me with whom I can do this for
parrots jackdaws cI never exchange a word with themnor with
the apes c for pretty near the same reason they act by rote as the
others speak by it and equally make me silent nay my dog and my
cat though I value them bothand for my dog he would speak if he
couldyet somehow or other they neither of them possess the talents
for conversationI can make nothing of a discourse with them beyond
the proposition the reply and rejoinder which terminated my fathers
and my mothers conversations in his beds of justiceand those
utterdtheres an end of the dialogue

But with an ass I can commune for ever

Come Honesty said Iseeing it was impracticable to pass betwixt him
and the gateart thou for coming in or going out

The ass twisted his head round to look up the street

Wellreplied Iwell wait a minute for thy driver

He turned his head thoughtful about and looked wistfully the opposite
way

I understand thee perfectly answered IIf thou takest a wrong step
in this affair he will cudgel thee to deathWell a minute is but a
minute and if it saves a fellowcreature a drubbing it shall not be
set down as illspent

He was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went on and
in the little peevish contentions of nature betwixt hunger and
unsavouriness had dropt it out of his mouth half a dozen times and
pickd it up againGod help thee Jack said I thou hast a bitter
breakfast ontand many a bitter days labourand many a bitter blow
I fear for its wagestis allall bitterness to thee whatever life
is to othersAnd now thy mouth if one knew the truth of it is as
bitter I dare say as sootfor he had cast aside the stem and thou
hast not a friend perhaps in all this world that will give thee a
macaroonIn saying this I pulld out a paper of em which I had just
purchased and gave him oneand at this moment that I am telling it
my heart smites me that there was more of pleasantry in the conceit
of seeing how an ass would eat a macaroonthan of benevolence in giving
him one which presided in the act

When the ass had eaten his macaroon I pressd him to come inthe poor
beast was heavy loadedhis legs seemd to tremble under himhe hung
rather backwards and as I pulld at his halter it broke short in my
handhe lookd up pensive in my faceDont thrash me with itbut if
you will you mayIf I do said I Ill be dd

The word was but onehalf of it pronounced like the abbess of
Andouilletsso there was no sin in itwhen a person coming in let
fall a thundering bastinado upon the poor devils crupper which put an
end to the ceremony

Out upon it cried Ibut the interjection was equivocaland I think
wrong placed toofor the end of an osier which had started out from the
contexture of the asss panier had caught hold of my breeches pocket
as he rushd by me and rent it in the most disastrous direction you can
imagineso that the

Out upon it in my opinion should have come in herebut this I leave
to be settled by

 The
 Reviewers
 of
 My Breeches

which I have brought over along with me for that purpose



Chapter 4XIV

When all was set to rights I came down stairs again into the basse cour
with my valet de place in order to sally out towards the tomb of the
two lovers cand was a second time stoppd at the gatenot by the
assbut by the person who struck him and who by that time had taken
possession as is not uncommon after a defeat of the very spot of
ground where the ass stood

It was a commissary sent to me from the postoffice with a rescript in
his hand for the payment of some six livres odd sous

Upon what account said ITis upon the part of the king replied the
commissary heaving up both his shoulders

My good friend quoth Ias sure as I am Iand you are you

And who are you said heDont puzzle me said I



Chapter 4XV

But it is an indubitable verity continued I addressing myself to the
commissary changing only the form of my asseverationthat I owe the
king of France nothing but my good will for he is a very honest man
and I wish him all health and pastime in the world

Pardonnez moireplied the commissary you are indebted to him six
livres four sous for the next post from hence to St Fons in your
route to Avignonwhich being a post royal you pay double for the
horses and postillionotherwise twould have amounted to no more than
three livres two sous

But I dont go by land said I

You may if you please replied the commissary

Your most obedient servantsaid I making him a low bow

The commissary with all the sincerity of grave good breedingmade me
one as low againI never was more disconcerted with a bow in my life

The devil take the serious character of these people quoth Iaside
they understand no more of Irony than this

The comparison was standing close by with his panniersbut something
seald up my lipsI could not pronounce the name

Sir said I collecting myselfit is not my intention to take post

But you maysaid he persisting in his first replyyou may take post
if you chuse

And I may take salt to my pickled herring said I if I chuse

But I do not chuse

But you must pay for it whether you do or no

Aye for the salt said I I know

And for the post too added he Defend me cried I

I travel by waterI am going down the Rhone this very afternoonmy
baggage is in the boatand I have actually paid nine livres for my
passage

Cest tout egaltis all one said he

Bon Dieu what pay for the way I go and for the way I do not go

Cest tout egal replied the commissary

The devil it is said Ibut I will go to ten thousand Bastiles
first

O England England thou land of liberty and climate of good sense
thou tenderest of mothersand gentlest of nurses cried I kneeling
upon one knee as I was beginning my apostrophe

When the director of Madam Le Blancs conscience coming in at that
instant and seeing a person in black with a face as pale as ashes at
his devotionslooking still paler by the contrast and distress of his
draperyaskd if I stood in want of the aids of the church

I go by Watersaid Iand heres another will be for making me pay for
going by Oil



Chapter 4XVI

As I perceived the commissary of the postoffice would have his six
livres four sous I had nothing else for it but to say some smart thing
upon the occasion worth the money

And so I set off thus

And pray Mr Commissary by what law of courtesy is a defenceless
stranger to be used just the reverse from what you use a Frenchman in
this matter

By no means said he

Excuse me said Ifor you have begun Sir with first tearing off my
breechesand now you want my pocket

Whereashad you first taken my pocket as you do with your own
peopleand then left me bare ad afterI had been a beast to have
complaind

As it is

Tis contrary to the law of nature

Tis contrary to reason

Tis contrary to the Gospel

But not to thissaid heputting a printed paper into my hand

Par le Roy

Tis a pithy prolegomenon quoth Iand so read on

By all which it appears quoth I having read it over a little too
rapidly that if a man sets out in a postchaise from Parishe must go
on travelling in one all the days of his lifeor pay for itExcuse
me said the commissary the spirit of the ordinance is thisThat if
you set out with an intention of running post from Paris to Avignon c
you shall not change that intention or mode of travelling without first
satisfying the fermiers for two posts further than the place you repent
atand tis founded continued he upon this that the Revenues are not
to fall short through your fickleness

O by heavens cried Iif fickleness is taxable in Francewe have
nothing to do but to make the best peace with you we can

And So the Peace Was Made

And if it is a bad oneas Tristram Shandy laid the cornerstone of
itnobody but Tristram Shandy ought to be hanged



Chapter 4XVII

Though I was sensible I had said as many clever things to the commissary
as came to six livres four sous yet I was determined to note down
the imposition amongst my remarks before I retired from the place so
putting my hand into my coatpocket for my remarkswhich by the
bye may be a caution to travellers to take a little more care of
their remarks for the future my remarks were stolenNever did sorry
traveller make such a pother and racket about his remarks as I did about
mine upon the occasion

Heaven earth sea fire cried I calling in every thing to my aid but
what I shouldMy remarks are stolenwhat shall I doMr Commissary
pray did I drop any remarks as I stood besides you

You droppd a good many very singular ones replied hePugh said I
those were but a few not worth above six livres two sousbut these are
a large parcelHe shook his headMonsieur Le Blanc Madam Le
Blanc did you see any papers of mineyou maid of the house run up
stairsFrancois run up after her

I must have my remarksthey were the best remarks cried I that ever
were madethe wisestthe wittiestWhat shall I dowhich way shall I
turn myself

Sancho Panca when he lost his asss Furniture did not exclaim more
bitterly



Chapter 4XVIII

When the first transport was over and the registers of the brain were
beginning to get a little out of the confusion into which this jumble of
cross accidents had cast themit then presently occurrd to me that I
had left my remarks in the pocket of the chaiseand that in selling
my chaise I had sold my remarks along with it to the chaisevamper I
leave this void space that the reader may swear into it any oath that
he is most accustomed toFor my own part if ever I swore a whole oath
into a vacancy in my life I think it was into that said
Iand so my remarks through France which were as full of wit as an
egg is full of meat and as well worth four hundred guineas as the said
egg is worth a pennyhave I been selling here to a chaisevamperfor
four Louis dOrsand giving him a postchaise by heaven worth six
into the bargain had it been to Dodsley or Becket or any creditable
bookseller who was either leaving off business and wanted a
postchaiseor who was beginning itand wanted my remarks and two
or three guineas along with themI could have borne itbut to a
chaisevampershew me to him this moment Francoissaid IThe valet
de place put on his hat and led the wayand I pulld off mine as I
passd the commissary and followed him



Chapter 4XIX

When we arrived at the chaisevampers house both the house and the
shop were shut up it was the eighth of September the nativity of the
blessed Virgin Mary mother of God

Tantarraratantivithe whole world was gone out a
Maypolingfrisking herecapering thereno body cared a button for me
or my remarks so I sat me down upon a bench by the door philosophating
upon my condition by a better fate than usually attends me I had not
waited half an hour when the mistress came in to take the papilliotes
from off her hair before she went to the Maypoles

The French women by the bye love Maypoles a la foliethat is as
much as their matinsgive em but a Maypole whether in May June
July or Septemberthey never count the timesdown it goestis meat
drink washing and lodging to emand had we but the policy an
please your worships as wood is a little scarce in France to send
them but plenty of Maypoles

The women would set them up and when they had done they would dance
round them and the men for company till they were all blind

The wife of the chaisevamper steppd in I told you to take the
papilliotes from off her hairthe toilet stands still for no manso
she jerkd off her cap to begin with them as she opend the door in
doing which one of them fell upon the groundI instantly saw it was my
own writing

O Seigneur cried Iyou have got all my remarks upon your head
MadamJen suis bien mortifiee said shetis well thinks I they
have stuck therefor could they have gone deeper they would have made
such confusion in a French womans noddleShe had better have gone with
it unfrizled to the day of eternity

Tenezsaid sheso without any idea of the nature of my suffering
she took them from her curls and put them gravely one by one into my
hatone was twisted this wayanother twisted thatey by my faith
and when they are published quoth I

They will be worse twisted still



Chapter 4XX

And now for Lippiuss clock said I with the air of a man who had got
thro all his difficultiesnothing can prevent us seeing that and the
Chinese history c except the time said Francoisfor tis almost
eleventhen we must speed the faster said I striding it away to the
cathedral

I cannot say in my heart that it gave me any concern in being told
by one of the minor canons as I was entering the west doorThat
Lippiuss great clock was all out of joints and had not gone for some
yearsIt will give me the more time thought I to peruse the Chinese
history and besides I shall be able to give the world a better account
of the clock in its decay than I could have done in its flourishing
condition

And so away I posted to the college of the Jesuits

Now it is with the project of getting a peep at the history of China in
Chinese charactersas with many others I could mention which strike
the fancy only at a distance for as I came nearer and nearer to the
pointmy blood cooldthe freak gradually went off till at length I
would not have given a cherrystone to have it gratifiedThe truth was
my time was short and my heart was at the Tomb of the LoversI wish to
God said I as I got the rapper in my hand that the key of the library
may be but lost it fell out as well

For all the Jesuits had got the cholicand to that degree as never was
known in the memory of the oldest practitioner



Chapter 4XXI

As I knew the geography of the Tomb of the Lovers as well as if I had
lived twenty years in Lyons namely that it was upon the turning of my
right hand just without the gate leading to the Fauxbourg de VaiseI
dispatched Francois to the boat that I might pay the homage I so long
owd it without a witness of my weaknessI walkd with all imaginable
joy towards the placewhen I saw the gate which intercepted the tomb
my heart glowed within me

Tender and faithful spirits cried I addressing myself to Amandus and
Amandalonglong have I tarried to drop this tear upon your tombI
comeI come

When I camethere was no tomb to drop it upon

What would I have given for my uncle Toby to have whistled Lillo
bullero



Chapter 4XXII

No matter how or in what moodbut I flew from the tomb of the
loversor rather I did not fly from itfor there was no such thing
existing and just got time enough to the boat to save my passageand
ere I had sailed a hundred yards the Rhone and the Saon met together
and carried me down merrily betwixt them

But I have described this voyage down the Rhone before I made it

So now I am at Avignon and as there is nothing to see but the old
house in which the duke of Ormond resided and nothing to stop me but
a short remark upon the place in three minutes you will see me crossing
the bridge upon a mule with Francois upon a horse with my portmanteau
behind him and the owner of both striding the way before us with a
long gun upon his shoulder and a sword under his arm lest peradventure
we should run away with his cattle Had you seen my breeches in entering
AvignonThough youd have seen them better I think as I mountedyou
would not have thought the precaution amiss or found in your heart to
have taken it in dudgeon for my own part I took it most kindly and
determined to make him a present of them when we got to the end of our
journey for the trouble they had put him to of arming himself at all
points against them

Before I go further let me get rid of my remark upon Avignon which is
this That I think it wrong merely because a mans hat has been blown
off his head by chance the first night he comes to Avignonthat he
should therefore say Avignon is more subject to high winds than any
town in all France for which reason I laid no stress upon the accident
till I had enquired of the master of the inn about it who telling me
seriously it was soand hearing moreover the windiness of Avignon
spoke of in the country about as a proverbI set it down merely to ask
the learned what can be the causethe consequence I sawfor they
are all Dukes Marquisses and Counts therethe duce a Baron in all
Avignonso that there is scarce any talking to them on a windy day

Prithee friend said I take hold of my mule for a momentfor I
wanted to pull off one of my jackboots which hurt my heelthe man was
standing quite idle at the door of the inn and as I had taken it into
my head he was someway concerned about the house or stable I put the
bridle into his handso begun with the bootwhen I had finished the
affair I turned about to take the mule from the man and thank him

But Monsieur le Marquis had walked in



Chapter 4XXIII

I had now the whole south of France from the banks of the Rhone to
those of the Garonne to traverse upon my mule at my own leisureat my
own leisurefor I had left Death the Lord knowsand He onlyhow far
behind meI have followed many a man thro France quoth hebut never
at this mettlesome rateStill he followedand still I fled himbut
I fled him cheerfullystill he pursuedbut like one who pursued
his prey without hopeas he laggd every step he lost softened his
lookswhy should I fly him at this rate

So notwithstanding all the commissary of the postoffice had said I
changed the mode of my travelling once more and after so precipitate
and rattling a course as I had run I flattered my fancy with thinking
of my mule and that I should traverse the rich plains of Languedoc upon
his back as slowly as foot could fall

There is nothing more pleasing to a travelleror more terrible to
travelwriters than a large rich plain especially if it is without
great rivers or bridges and presents nothing to the eye but one
unvaried picture of plenty for after they have once told you that
tis delicious or delightful as the case happensthat the soil was
grateful and that nature pours out all her abundance cthey have
then a large plain upon their hands which they know not what to do
withand which is of little or no use to them but to carry them to some
town and that town perhaps of little more but a new place to start
from to the next plainand so on

This is most terrible work judge if I dont manage my plains better



Chapter 4XXIV

I had not gone above two leagues and a half before the man with his gun
began to look at his priming

I had three several times loiterd terribly behind half a mile at least
every time once in deep conference with a drummaker who was making
drums for the fairs of Baucaira and TarasconeI did not understand the
principles

The second time I cannot so properly say I stoppdfor meeting a
couple of Franciscans straitened more for time than myself and not
being able to get to the bottom of what I was aboutI had turnd back
with them

The third was an affair of trade with a gossip for a handbasket of
Provence figs for four sous this would have been transacted at once
but for a case of conscience at the close of it for when the figs were
paid for it turnd out that there were two dozen of eggs covered over
with vineleaves at the bottom of the basketas I had no intention of
buying eggsI made no sort of claim of themas for the space they had
occupiedwhat signified it I had figs enow for my money

But it was my intention to have the basketit was the gossips
intention to keep it without which she could do nothing with her
eggsand unless I had the basket I could do as little with my figs
which were too ripe already and most of em burst at the side this
brought on a short contention which terminated in sundry proposals
what we should both do

How we disposed of our eggs and figs I defy you or the Devil
himself had he not been there which I am persuaded he was to form
the least probable conjecture You will read the whole of itnot this
year for I am hastening to the story of my uncle Tobys amoursbut
you will read it in the collection of those which have arose out of the
journey across this plainand which therefore I call my

Plain Stories

How far my pen has been fatigued like those of other travellers in
this journey of it over so barren a trackthe world must judgebut
the traces of it which are now all set o vibrating together this
moment tell me tis the most fruitful and busy period of my life for
as I had made no convention with my man with the gun as to timeby
stopping and talking to every soul I met who was not in a full
trotjoining all parties before mewaiting for every soul
behindhailing all those who were coming through crossroadsarresting
all kinds of beggars pilgrims fiddlers friarsnot passing by a woman
in a mulberrytree without commending her legs and tempting her into
conversation with a pinch of snuffIn short by seizing every handle
of what size or shape soever which chance held out to me in this
journeyI turned my plain into a cityI was always in company and
with great variety too and as my mule loved society as much as myself

metI am confident we could have passed through PallMall or St
JamessStreet for a month together with fewer adventuresand seen
less of human nature

O there is that sprightly frankness which at once unpins every plait
of a Languedocians dressthat whatever is beneath it it looks so
like the simplicity which poets sing of in better daysI will delude my
fancy and believe it is so

Twas in the road betwixt Nismes and Lunel where there is the best

A sunburnt daughter of Labour rose up from the groupe to meet me as
I advanced towards them her hair which was a dark chesnut approaching
rather to a black was tied up in a knot all but a single tress

We want a cavalier said she holding out both her hands as if to offer

Hadst thou Nannette been arrayd like a duchesse

But that cursed slit in thy petticoat

Nannette cared not for it

We could not have done without you said she letting go one hand with
selftaught politeness leading me up with the other

A lame youth whom Apollo had recompensed with a pipe and to which he
had added a tabourin of his own accord ran sweetly over the prelude

Lunel to Montpellierfrom thence to Pescnas BeziersI danced it along
through Narbonne Carcasson and Castle Naudairy till at last I danced
myself into Perdrillos pavillion where pulling out a paper of black
lines that I might go on straight forwards without digression or
parenthesis in my uncle Tobys amours

I begun thus



Chapter 4XXV

But softlyfor in these sportive plains and under this genial sun
where at this instant all flesh is running out piping fiddling and
dancing to the vintage and every step thats taken the judgment is
surprised by the imagination I defy notwithstanding all that has been
said upon straight lines Vid Vol III in sundry pages of my bookI
defy the best cabbage planter that ever existed whether he plants
backwards or forwards it makes little difference in the account
except that he will have more to answer for in the one case than in
the otherI defy him to go on coolly critically and canonically
planting his cabbages one by one in straight lines and stoical
distances especially if slits in petticoats are unsewd upwithout
ever and anon straddling out or sidling into some bastardly
digressionIn Freezeland Fogland and some other lands I wot ofit
may be done

But in this clear climate of fantasy and perspiration where every idea
sensible and insensible gets ventin this land my dear Eugeniusin
this fertile land of chivalry and romance where I now sit unskrewing
my inkhorn to write my uncle Tobys amours and with all the meanders
of Julias track in quest of her Diego in full view of my study
windowif thou comest not and takest me by the hand

What a work it is likely to turn out

Let us begin it



Chapter 4XXVI

It is with Love as with Cuckoldom

But now I am talking of beginning a book and have long had a thing upon
my mind to be imparted to the reader which if not imparted now can
never be imparted to him as long as I live whereas the Comparison may
be imparted to him any hour in the dayIll just mention it and begin
in good earnest

The thing is this

That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now in
practice throughout the known world I am confident my own way of doing
it is the bestIm sure it is the most religiousfor I begin with
writing the first sentenceand trusting to Almighty God for the second

Twould cure an author for ever of the fuss and folly of opening his
streetdoor and calling in his neighbours and friends and kinsfolk
with the devil and all his imps with their hammers and engines c
only to observe how one sentence of mine follows another and how the
plan follows the whole

I wish you saw me half starting out of my chair with what confidence
as I grasp the elbow of it I look upcatching the idea even sometimes
before it half way reaches me

I believe in my conscience I intercept many a thought which heaven
intended for another man

Pope and his Portrait Vid Popes Portrait are fools to meno martyr
is ever so full of faith or fireI wish I could say of good works
toobut I have no

 Zeal or Angeror
 Anger or Zeal

And till gods and men agree together to call it by the same namethe
errantest Tartuffe in sciencein politicsor in religion shall
never kindle a spark within me or have a worse word or a more unkind
greeting than what he will read in the next chapter



Chapter 4XXVII

Bon jourgood morrowso you have got your cloak on betimesbut
tis a cold morning and you judge the matter rightlytis better to
be well mounted than go o footand obstructions in the glands are
dangerousAnd how goes it with thy concubinethy wifeand thy little
ones o both sides and when did you hear from the old gentleman and
ladyyour sister aunt uncle and cousinsI hope they have got
better of their colds coughs claps toothaches fevers stranguries
sciaticas swellings and sore eyes

What a devil of an apothecary to take so much bloodgive such a vile
purgepukepoulticeplaisternightdraughtclysterblisterAnd
why so many grains of calomel santa Maria and such a dose of opium
periclitating pardi the whole family of ye from head to tailBy my
greataunt Dinahs old black velvet mask I think there is no occasion
for it

Now this being a little bald about the chin by frequently putting off
and on before she was got with child by the coachmannot one of our
family would wear it after To cover the Mask afresh was more than the
mask was worthand to wear a mask which was bald or which could be
half seen through was as bad as having no mask at all

This is the reason may it please your reverences that in all our
numerous family for these four generations we count no more than one
archbishop a Welch judge some three or four aldermen and a single
mountebank

In the sixteenth century we boast of no less than a dozen alchymists



Chapter 4XXVIII

It is with Love as with Cuckoldomthe suffering party is at least the
third but generally the last in the house who knows any thing about
the matter this comes as all the world knows from having half a dozen
words for one thing and so long as what in this vessel of the
human frame is Lovemay be Hatred in thatSentiment half a yard
higherand Nonsenseno Madamnot thereI mean at the part I am now
pointing to with my forefingerhow can we help ourselves

Of all mortal and immortal men too if you please who ever
soliloquized upon this mystic subject my uncle Toby was the worst
fitted to have pushd his researches thro such a contention of
feelings and he had infallibly let them all run on as we do
worse matters to see what they would turn outhad not Bridgets
prenotification of them to Susannah and Susannahs repeated
manifestoes thereupon to all the world made it necessary for my uncle
Toby to look into the affair



Chapter 4XXIX

Why weavers gardeners and gladiatorsor a man with a pined leg
proceeding from some ailment in the footshould ever have had some
tender nymph breaking her heart in secret for them are points well and
duly settled and accounted for by ancient and modern physiologists

A waterdrinker provided he is a professd one and does it without
fraud or covin is precisely in the same predicament not that at first
sight there is any consequence or show of logic in it That a rill of
cold water dribbling through my inward parts should light up a torch in
my Jennys

The proposition does not strike one on the contrary it seems to run
opposite to the natural workings of causes and effects

But it shews the weakness and imbecility of human reason

And in perfect good health with it

The most perfectMadam that friendship herself could wish me

And drink nothingnothing but water

Impetuous fluid the moment thou pressest against the floodgates of
the brainsee how they give way

In swims Curiosity beckoning to her damsels to followthey dive into
the center of the current

Fancy sits musing upon the bank and with her eyes following the stream
turns straws and bulrushes into masts and bowspritsAnd Desire with
vest held up to the knee in one hand snatches at them as they swim by
her with the other

O ye water drinkers is it then by this delusive fountain that ye
have so often governed and turnd this world about like a
millwheelgrinding the faces of the impotentbepowdering their
ribsbepeppering their noses and changing sometimes even the very
frame and face of nature

If I was you quoth Yorick I would drink more water EugeniusAnd if
I was you Yorick replied Eugenius so would I

Which shews they had both read Longinus

For my own part I am resolved never to read any book but my own as
long as I live



Chapter 4XXX

I wish my uncle Toby had been a waterdrinker for then the thing had
been accounted for That the first moment Widow Wadman saw him she felt
something stirring within her in his favourSomethingsomething

Something perhaps more than friendshipless than lovesomethingno
matter whatno matter whereI would not give a single hair off my
mules tail and be obliged to pluck it off myself indeed the villain
has not many to spare and is not a little vicious into the bargain to
be let by your worships into the secret

But the truth is my uncle Toby was not a waterdrinker he drank it
neither pure nor mixd or any how or any where except fortuitously
upon some advanced posts where better liquor was not to be hador
during the time he was under cure when the surgeon telling him it would
extend the fibres and bring them sooner into contactmy uncle Toby
drank it for quietness sake

Now as all the world knows that no effect in nature can be produced
without a cause and as it is as well known that my uncle Toby was
neither a weavera gardener or a gladiatorunless as a captain you
will needs have him onebut then he was only a captain of footand
besides the whole is an equivocationThere is nothing left for us to
suppose but that my uncle Tobys legbut that will avail us little in
the present hypothesis unless it had proceeded from some ailment in
the footwhereas his leg was not emaciated from any disorder in his
footfor my uncle Tobys leg was not emaciated at all It was a little
stiff and awkward from a total disuse of it for the three years he lay
confined at my fathers house in town but it was plump and muscular
and in all other respects as good and promising a leg as the other

I declare I do not recollect any one opinion or passage of my life
where my understanding was more at a loss to make ends meet and torture
the chapter I had been writing to the service of the chapter following
it than in the present case one would think I took a pleasure in
running into difficulties of this kind merely to make fresh experiments
of getting out of emInconsiderate soul that thou art What are not
the unavoidable distresses with which as an author and a man thou art
hemmd in on every side of theeare they Tristram not sufficient but
thou must entangle thyself still more

Is it not enough that thou art in debt and that thou hast ten
cartloads of thy fifth and sixth volumes Alluding to the first
edition stillstill unsold and art almost at thy wits ends how to
get them off thy hands

To this hour art thou not tormented with the vile asthma that thou
gattest in skating against the wind in Flanders and is it but two
months ago that in a fit of laughter on seeing a cardinal make water
like a quirister with both hands thou brakest a vessel in thy lungs
whereby in two hours thou lost as many quarts of blood and hadst thou
lost as much more did not the faculty tell theeit would have amounted
to a gallon



Chapter 4XXXI

But for heavens sake let us not talk of quarts or gallonslet us
take the story straight before us it is so nice and intricate a one it
will scarce bear the transposition of a single tittle and somehow or
other you have got me thrust almost into the middle of it

I beg we may take more care



Chapter 4XXXII

My uncle Toby and the corporal had posted down with so much heat and
precipitation to take possession of the spot of ground we have so often
spoke of in order to open their campaign as early as the rest of the
allies that they had forgot one of the most necessary articles of the
whole affair it was neither a pioneers spade a pickax or a shovel

It was a bed to lie on so that as ShandyHall was at that time
unfurnished and the little inn where poor Le Fever died not yet built
my uncle Toby was constrained to accept of a bed at Mrs Wadmans for
a night or two till corporal Trim who to the character of an excellent
valet groom cook sempster surgeon and engineer superadded that of
an excellent upholsterer too with the help of a carpenter and a couple
of taylors constructed one in my uncle Tobys house

A daughter of Eve for such was widow Wadman and tis all the character
I intend to give of her

That she was a perfect woman had better be fifty leagues offor
in her warm bedor playing with a caseknifeor any thing you
pleasethan make a man the object of her attention when the house and
all the furniture is her own

There is nothing in it out of doors and in broad daylight where a
woman has a power physically speaking of viewing a man in more lights
than onebut here for her soul she can see him in no light without
mixing something of her own goods and chattels along with himtill
by reiterated acts of such combination he gets foisted into her
inventory

And then good night

But this is not matter of System for I have delivered that abovenor
is it matter of Breviaryfor I make no mans creed but my ownnor
matter of Factat least that I know of but tis matter copulative and
introductory to what follows



Chapter 4XXXIII

I do not speak it with regard to the coarseness or cleanness of themor
the strength of their gussetsbut pray do not nightshifts differ
from dayshifts as much in this particular as in any thing else in the
world that they so far exceed the others in length that when you
are laid down in them they fall almost as much below the feet as the
dayshifts fall short of them

Widow Wadmans nightshifts as was the mode I suppose in King Williams
and Queen Annes reigns were cut however after this fashion and if the
fashion is changed for in Italy they are come to nothingso much the
worse for the public they were two Flemish ells and a half in length
so that allowing a moderate woman two ells she had half an ell to
spare to do what she would with

Now from one little indulgence gained after another in the many
bleak and decemberley nights of a seven years widowhood things
had insensibly come to this pass and for the two last years had got
establishd into one of the ordinances of the bedchamberThat as soon
as Mrs Wadman was put to bed and had got her legs stretched down to
the bottom of it of which she always gave Bridget noticeBridget with
all suitable decorum having first opend the bedclothes at the feet
took hold of the halfell of cloth we are speaking of and having
gently and with both her hands drawn it downwards to its furthest
extension and then contracted it again sidelong by four or five even
plaits she took a large corkingpin out of her sleeve and with the
point directed towards her pinnd the plaits all fast together a little
above the hem which done she tuckd all in tight at the feet and
wishd her mistress a good night

This was constant and without any other variation than this that on
shivering and tempestuous nights when Bridget untuckd the feet of the
bed c to do thisshe consulted no thermometer but that of her
own passions and so performed it standingkneelingor squatting
according to the different degrees of faith hope and charity she was
in and bore towards her mistress that night In every other respect
the etiquette was sacred and might have vied with the most mechanical
one of the most inflexible bedchamber in Christendom

The first night as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle Toby
up stairs which was about tenMrs Wadman threw herself into her
armchair and crossing her left knee with her right which formed a
restingplace for her elbow she reclind her cheek upon the palm of her
hand and leaning forwards ruminated till midnight upon both sides of
the question

The second night she went to her bureau and having ordered Bridget to
bring her up a couple of fresh candles and leave them upon the table
she took out her marriagesettlement and read it over with great
devotion and the third night which was the last of my uncle Tobys
stay when Bridget had pulld down the nightshift and was assaying to
stick in the corking pin

With a kick of both heels at once but at the same time the
most natural kick that could be kickd in her situationfor
supposing to be the sun in its meridian it was a northeast
kickshe kickd the pin out of her fingersthe etiquette which hung
upon it downdown it fell to the ground and was shiverd into a
thousand atoms

From all which it was plain that widow Wadman was in love with my uncle
Toby



Chapter 4XXXIV

My uncle Tobys head at that time was full of other matters so that it
was not till the demolition of Dunkirk when all the other civilities of
Europe were settled that he found leisure to return this

This made an armistice that is speaking with regard to my uncle
Tobybut with respect to Mrs Wadman a vacancyof almost eleven
years But in all cases of this nature as it is the second blow happen
at what distance of time it will which makes the frayI chuse for
that reason to call these the amours of my uncle Toby with Mrs Wadman
rather than the amours of Mrs Wadman with my uncle Toby

This is not a distinction without a difference

It is not like the affair of an old hat cockdand a cockd old
hat about which your reverences have so often been at odds with one
anotherbut there is a difference here in the nature of things

And let me tell you gentry a wide one too



Chapter 4XXXV

Now as widow Wadman did love my uncle Tobyand my uncle Toby did not
love widow Wadman there was nothing for widow Wadman to do but to go
on and love my uncle Tobyor let it alone

Widow Wadman would do neither the one or the other

Gracious heavenbut I forget I am a little of her temper myself for
whenever it so falls out which it sometimes does about the equinoxes
that an earthly goddess is so much this and that and tother that I
cannot eat my breakfast for herand that she careth not three halfpence
whether I eat my breakfast or no

Curse on her and so I send her to Tartary and from Tartary to Terra
del Fuogo and so on to the devil in short there is not an infernal
nitch where I do not take her divinityship and stick it

But as the heart is tender and the passions in these tides ebb and flow
ten times in a minute I instantly bring her back again and as I do all
things in extremes I place her in the very center of the milkyway

Brightest of stars thou wilt shed thy influence upon some one

The duce take her and her influence toofor at that word I lose all
patiencemuch good may it do himBy all that is hirsute and gashly I
cry taking off my furrd cap and twisting it round my fingerI would
not give sixpence for a dozen such

But tis an excellent cap too putting it upon my head and pressing
it close to my earsand warmand soft especially if you stroke
it the right waybut alas that will never be my luckso here my
philosophy is shipwreckd again

No I shall never have a finger in the pye so here I break my
metaphor Crust and Crumb
 Inside and out

Top and bottomI detest it I hate it I repudiate itIm sick at the
sight of it

 Tis all pepper
 garlick
 staragen
 salt and

devils dungby the great archcooks of cooks who does nothing I
think from morning to night but sit down by the fireside and invent
inflammatory dishes for us I would not touch it for the world

O Tristram Tristram cried Jenny

O Jenny Jenny replied I and so went on with the thirtysixth chapter



Chapter 4XXXVI

Not touch it for the world did I say

Lord how I have heated my imagination with this metaphor



Chapter 4XXXVII

Which shews let your reverences and worships say what you will of it
for as for thinkingall who do thinkthink pretty much alike both
upon it and other mattersLove is certainly at least alphabetically
speaking one of the most

though by the bye the R should have gone firstBut in short tis of
such a nature as my father once told my uncle Toby upon the close of a
long dissertation upon the subjectYou can scarce said he combine
two ideas together upon it brother Toby without an hypallageWhats
that cried my uncle Toby

The cart before the horse replied my father

And what is he to do there cried my uncle Toby

Nothing quoth my father but to get inor let it alone

Now widow Wadman as I told you before would do neither the one or the
other

She stood however ready harnessed and caparisoned at all points to
watch accidents



Chapter 4XXXVIII

The Fates who certainly all foreknew of these amours of widow Wadman
and my uncle Toby had from the first creation of matter and motion
and with more courtesy than they usually do things of this kind
established such a chain of causes and effects hanging so fast to one
another that it was scarce possible for my uncle Toby to have dwelt in
any other house in the world or to have occupied any other garden
in Christendom but the very house and garden which joind and laid
parallel to Mrs Wadmans this with the advantage of a thickset
arbour in Mrs Wadmans garden but planted in the hedgerow of my
uncle Tobys put all the occasions into her hands which Lovemilitancy
wanted she could observe my uncle Tobys motions and was mistress
likewise of his councils of war and as his unsuspecting heart had given
leave to the corporal through the mediation of Bridget to make her
a wickergate of communication to enlarge her walks it enabled her
to carry on her approaches to the very door of the sentrybox and
sometimes out of gratitude to make an attack and endeavour to blow my
uncle Toby up in the very sentrybox itself



Chapter 4XXXIX

It is a great pitybut tis certain from every days observation of
man that he may be set on fire like a candle at either endprovided
there is a sufficient wick standing out if there is nottheres an
end of the affair and if there isby lighting it at the bottom as
the flame in that case has the misfortune generally to put out
itselftheres an end of the affair again

For my part could I always have the ordering of it which way I would
be burnt myselffor I cannot bear the thoughts of being burnt like a
beastI would oblige a housewife constantly to light me at the top for
then I should burn down decently to the socket that is from my head to
my heart from my heart to my liver from my liver to my bowels and
so on by the meseraick veins and arteries through all the turns and
lateral insertions of the intestines and their tunicles to the blind
gut

I beseech you doctor Slop quoth my uncle Toby interrupting him as
he mentioned the blind gut in a discourse with my father the night my
mother was brought to bed of meI beseech you quoth my uncle Toby to
tell me which is the blind gut for old as I am I vow I do not know to
this day where it lies

The blind gut answered doctor Slop lies betwixt the Ilion and Colon

In a man said my father

Tis precisely the same cried doctor Slop in a woman

Thats more than I know quoth my father



Chapter 4XL

And so to make sure of both systems Mrs Wadman predetermined to
light my uncle Toby neither at this end or that but like a prodigals
candle to light him if possible at both ends at once

Now through all the lumber rooms of military furniture including both
of horse and foot from the great arsenal of Venice to the Tower of
London exclusive if Mrs Wadman had been rummaging for seven years
together and with Bridget to help her she could not have found any one
blind or mantelet so fit for her purpose as that which the expediency
of my uncle Tobys affairs had fixd up ready to her hands

I believe I have not told youbut I dont knowpossibly I havebe it
as it will tis one of the number of those many things which a man
had better do over again than dispute about itThat whatever town
or fortress the corporal was at work upon during the course of
their campaign my uncle Toby always took care on the inside of his
sentrybox which was towards his left hand to have a plan of the
place fastend up with two or three pins at the top but loose at
the bottom for the conveniency of holding it up to the eye cas
occasions required so that when an attack was resolved upon Mrs
Wadman had nothing more to do when she had got advanced to the door
of the sentrybox but to extend her right hand and edging in her left
foot at the same movement to take hold of the map or plan or upright
or whatever it was and with outstretched neck meeting it half wayto
advance it towards her on which my uncle Tobys passions were sure to
catch firefor he would instantly take hold of the other corner of the
map in his left hand and with the end of his pipe in the other begin
an explanation

When the attack was advanced to this pointthe world will
naturally enter into the reasons of Mrs Wadmans next stroke of
generalshipwhich was to take my uncle Tobys tobaccopipe out of his
hand as soon as she possibly could which under one pretence or other
but generally that of pointing more distinctly at some redoubt or
breastwork in the map she would effect before my uncle Toby poor
soul had well marchd above half a dozen toises with it

It obliged my uncle Toby to make use of his forefinger

The difference it made in the attack was this That in going upon it as
in the first case with the end of her forefinger against the end of my
uncle Tobys tobaccopipe she might have travelled with it along the
lines from Dan to Beersheba had my uncle Tobys lines reachd so far
without any effect For as there was no arterial or vital heat in the
end of the tobaccopipe it could excite no sentimentit could neither
give fire by pulsationor receive it by sympathytwas nothing but
smoke

Whereas in following my uncle Tobys forefinger with hers close thro
all the little turns and indentings of his workspressing sometimes
against the side of itthen treading upon its nailthen tripping it
upthen touching it herethen there and so onit set something at
least in motion

This tho slight skirmishing and at a distance from the main body yet
drew on the rest for here the map usually falling with the back of it
close to the side of the sentrybox my uncle Toby in the simplicity
of his soul would lay his hand flat upon it in order to go on with his
explanation and Mrs Wadman by a manoeuvre as quick as thought
would as certainly place hers close beside it this at once opened a
communication large enough for any sentiment to pass or repass which
a person skilld in the elementary and practical part of lovemaking
has occasion for

By bringing up her forefinger parallel as before to my uncle
Tobysit unavoidably brought the thumb into actionand the forefinger
and thumb being once engaged as naturally brought in the whole hand
Thine dear uncle Toby was never now in ts right placeMrs Wadman
had it ever to take up or with the gentlest pushings protrusions
and equivocal compressions that a hand to be removed is capable of
receivingto get it pressd a hair breadth of one side out of her way

Whilst this was doing how could she forget to make him sensible that
it was her leg and no ones else at the bottom of the sentrybox
which slightly pressd against the calf of hisSo that my uncle Toby
being thus attackd and sore pushd on both his wingswas it a wonder
if now and then it put his centre into disorder

The duce take it said my uncle Toby



Chapter 4XLI

These attacks of Mrs Wadman you will readily conceive to be of
different kinds varying from each other like the attacks which history
is full of and from the same reasons A general lookeron would scarce
allow them to be attacks at allor if he did would confound them all
togetherbut I write not to them it will be time enough to be a little
more exact in my descriptions of them as I come up to them which will
not be for some chapters having nothing more to add in this but that
in a bundle of original papers and drawings which my father took care
to roll up by themselves there is a plan of Bouchain in perfect
preservation and shall be kept so whilst I have power to preserve any
thing upon the lower corner of which on the right hand side there is
still remaining the marks of a snuffy finger and thumb which there
is all the reason in the world to imagine were Mrs Wadmans for
the opposite side of the margin which I suppose to have been my uncle
Tobys is absolutely clean This seems an authenticated record of one
of these attacks for there are vestigia of the two punctures partly
grown up but still visible on the opposite corner of the map which are
unquestionably the very holes through which it has been pricked up in
the sentrybox

By all that is priestly I value this precious relick with its stigmata
and pricks more than all the relicks of the Romish churchalways
excepting when I am writing upon these matters the pricks which
entered the flesh of St Radagunda in the desert which in your road
from Fesse to Cluny the nuns of that name will shew you for love



Chapter 4XLII

I think an please your honour quoth Trim the fortifications are
quite destroyedand the bason is upon a level with the moleI think
so too replied my uncle Toby with a sigh half suppressdbut step into
the parlour Trim for the stipulationit lies upon the table

It has lain there these six weeks replied the corporal till this very
morning that the old woman kindled the fire with it

Then said my uncle Toby there is no further occasion for our
services The more an please your honour the pity said the corporal
in uttering which he cast his spade into the wheelbarrow which was
beside him with an air the most expressive of disconsolation that can
be imagined and was heavily turning about to look for his pickax his
pioneers shovel his picquets and other little military stores in
order to carry them off the fieldwhen a heighho from the sentrybox
which being made of thin slit deal reverberated the sound more
sorrowfully to his ear forbad him

No said the corporal to himself Ill do it before his honour rises
tomorrow morning so taking his spade out of the wheelbarrow again
with a little earth in it as if to level something at the foot of the
glacisbut with a real intent to approach nearer to his master in
order to divert himhe loosend a sod or twopared their edges with
his spade and having given them a gentle blow or two with the back
of it he sat himself down close by my uncle Tobys feet and began as
follows



Chapter 4XLIII

It was a thousand pitiesthough I believe an please your honour I am
going to say but a foolish kind of a thing for a soldier

A soldier cried my uncle Toby interrupting the corporal is no more
exempt from saying a foolish thing Trim than a man of lettersBut not
so often an please your honour replied the corporalmy uncle Toby
gave a nod

It was a thousand pities then said the corporal casting his eye upon
Dunkirk and the mole as Servius Sulpicius in returning out of Asia
when he sailed from Aegina towards Megara did upon Corinth and
Pyreus

It was a thousand pities an please your honour to destroy these
worksand a thousand pities to have let them stood

Thou art right Trim in both cases said my uncle TobyThis
continued the corporal is the reason that from the beginning of their
demolition to the endI have never once whistled or sung or laughd
or cryd or talkd of past done deeds or told your honour one story
good or bad

Thou hast many excellencies Trim said my uncle Toby and I hold it
not the least of them as thou happenest to be a storyteller that of
the number thou hast told me either to amuse me in my painful hours or
divert me in my grave onesthou hast seldom told me a bad one

Because an please your honour except one of a King of Bohemia and
his seven castlesthey are all true for they are about myself

I do not like the subject the worse Trim said my uncle Toby on that
score But prithee what is this story thou hast excited my curiosity

Ill tell it your honour quoth the corporal directlyProvided
said my uncle Toby looking earnestly towards Dunkirk and the mole
againprovided it is not a merry one to such Trim a man should ever
bring one half of the entertainment along with him and the disposition
I am in at present would wrong both thee Trim and thy storyIt is
not a merry one by any means replied the corporalNor would I have it
altogether a grave one added my uncle TobyIt is neither the one nor
the other replied the corporal but will suit your honour exactlyThen
Ill thank thee for it with all my heart cried my uncle Toby so
prithee begin it Trim

The corporal made his reverence and though it is not so easy a matter
as the world imagines to pull off a lank Monterocap with graceor a
whit less difficult in my conceptions when a man is sitting squat upon
the ground to make a bow so teeming with respect as the corporal was
wont yet by suffering the palm of his right hand which was towards his
master to slip backwards upon the grass a little beyond his body in
order to allow it the greater sweepand by an unforced compression at
the same time of his cap with the thumb and the two forefingers of his
left by which the diameter of the cap became reduced so that it
might be said rather to be insensibly squeezdthan pulld off with a
flatusthe corporal acquitted himself of both in a better manner than
the posture of his affairs promised and having hemmed twice to find in
what key his story would best go and best suit his masters humourhe
exchanged a single look of kindness with him and set off thus

The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles

There was a certain king of BoheAs the corporal was entering the
confines of Bohemia my uncle Toby obliged him to halt for a single
moment he had set out bareheaded having since he pulld off his
Monterocap in the latter end of the last chapter left it lying beside
him on the ground

The eye of Goodness espieth all thingsso that before the corporal
had well got through the first five words of his story had my
uncle Toby twice touchd his Monterocap with the end of his cane
interrogativelyas much as to say Why dont you put it on Trim Trim
took it up with the most respectful slowness and casting a glance of
humiliation as he did it upon the embroidery of the forepart which
being dismally tarnishd and frayd moreover in some of the principal
leaves and boldest parts of the pattern he layd it down again between
his two feet in order to moralize upon the subject

Tis every word of it but too true cried my uncle Toby that thou art
about to observe

Nothing in this world Trim is made to last for ever

But when tokens dear Tom of thy love and remembrance wear out said
Trim what shall we say

There is no occasion Trim quoth my uncle Toby to say any thing else
and was a man to puzzle his brains till Dooms day I believe Trim it
would be impossible

The corporal perceiving my uncle Toby was in the right and that it
would be in vain for the wit of man to think of extracting a purer moral
from his cap without further attempting it he put it on and passing
his hand across his forehead to rub out a pensive wrinkle which the
text and the doctrine between them had engenderd he returnd with the
same look and tone of voice to his story of the king of Bohemia and his
seven castles

The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles Continued

There was a certain king of Bohemia but in whose reign except his own
I am not able to inform your honour

I do not desire it of thee Trim by any means cried my uncle Toby

It was a little before the time an please your honour when giants
were beginning to leave off breedingbut in what year of our Lord that
was

I would not give a halfpenny to know said my uncle Toby

Only an please your honour it makes a story look the better in the
face

Tis thy own Trim so ornament it after thy own fashion and take
any date continued my uncle Toby looking pleasantly upon himtake any
date in the whole world thou chusest and put it tothou art heartily
welcome

The corporal bowed for of every century and of every year of that
century from the first creation of the world down to Noahs flood and
from Noahs flood to the birth of Abraham through all the pilgrimages
of the patriarchs to the departure of the Israelites out of Egyptand
throughout all the Dynasties Olympiads Urbeconditas and other
memorable epochas of the different nations of the world down to the
coming of Christ and from thence to the very moment in which the
corporal was telling his storyhad my uncle Toby subjected this vast
empire of time and all its abysses at his feet but as Modesty scarce
touches with a finger what Liberality offers her with both hands
openthe corporal contented himself with the very worst year of the
whole bunch which to prevent your honours of the Majority and Minority
from tearing the very flesh off your bones in contestation Whether
that year is not always the last castyear of the last castalmanackI
tell you plainly it was but from a different reason than you wot of

It was the year next himwhich being the year of our Lord seventeen
hundred and twelve when the Duke of Ormond was playing the devil
in Flandersthe corporal took it and set out with it afresh on his
expedition to Bohemia

The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles Continued

In the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twelve there
was an please your honour

To tell thee truly Trim quoth my uncle Toby any other date would
have pleased me much better not only on account of the sad stain upon
our history that year in marching off our troops and refusing to cover
the siege of Quesnoi though Fagel was carrying on the works with such
incredible vigourbut likewise on the score Trim of thy own story
because if there areand which from what thou hast dropt I partly
suspect to be the factif there are giants in it

There is but one an please your honour

Tis as bad as twenty replied my uncle Tobythou shouldst have
carried him back some seven or eight hundred years out of harms way
both of critics and other people and therefore I would advise thee if
ever thou tellest it again

If I live an please your honour but once to get through it I
will never tell it again quoth Trim either to man woman or
childPoopoo said my uncle Tobybut with accents of such sweet
encouragement did he utter it that the corporal went on with his story
with more alacrity than ever

The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles Continued

There was an please your honour said the corporal raising his voice
and rubbing the palms of his two hands cheerily together as he begun a
certain king of Bohemia

Leave out the date entirely Trim quoth my uncle Toby leaning
forwards and laying his hand gently upon the corporals shoulder to
temper the interruptionleave it out entirely Trim a story passes
very well without these niceties unless one is pretty sure of emSure
of em said the corporal shaking his head

Right answered my uncle Toby it is not easy Trim for one bred up as
thou and I have been to arms who seldom looks further forward than to
the end of his musket or backwards beyond his knapsack to know much
about this matterGod bless your honour said the corporal won by the
manner of my uncle Tobys reasoning as much as by the reasoning itself
he has something else to do if not on action or a march or upon
duty in his garrisonhe has his firelock an please your honour
to furbishhis accoutrements to take care ofhis regimentals to
mendhimself to shave and keep clean so as to appear always like what
he is upon the parade what business added the corporal triumphantly
has a soldier an please your honour to know any thing at all of
geography

Thou wouldst have said chronology Trim said my uncle Toby for
as for geography tis of absolute use to him he must be acquainted
intimately with every country and its boundaries where his profession
carries him he should know every town and city and village and hamlet
with the canals the roads and hollow ways which lead up to them there
is not a river or a rivulet he passes Trim but he should be able at
first sight to tell thee what is its namein what mountains it
takes its risewhat is its coursehow far it is navigablewhere
fordablewhere not he should know the fertility of every valley as
well as the hind who ploughs it and be able to describe or if it is
required to give thee an exact map of all the plains and defiles the
forts the acclivities the woods and morasses thro and by which his
army is to march he should know their produce their plants their
minerals their waters their animals their seasons their climates
their heats and cold their inhabitants their customs their language
their policy and even their religion

Is it else to be conceived corporal continued my uncle Toby rising
up in his sentrybox as he began to warm in this part of his
discoursehow Marlborough could have marched his army from the banks of
the Maes to Belburg from Belburg to Kerpenordhere the corporal
could sit no longer from Kerpenord Trim to Kalsaken from Kalsaken
to Newdorf from Newdorf to Landenbourg from Landenbourg to Mildenheim
from Mildenheim to Elchingen from Elchingen to Gingen from Gingen to
Balmerchoffen from Balmerchoffen to Skellenburg where he broke in
upon the enemys works forced his passage over the Danube crossd the
Lechpushd on his troops into the heart of the empire marching at the
head of them through Fribourg Hokenwert and Schonevelt to the plains
of Blenheim and HochstetGreat as he was corporal he could not have
advanced a step or made one single days march without the aids of
GeographyAs for Chronology I own Trim continued my uncle Toby
sitting down again coolly in his sentrybox that of all others it
seems a science which the soldier might best spare was it not for the
lights which that science must one day give him in determining the
invention of powder the furious execution of which renversing every
thing like thunder before it has become a new aera to us of military
improvements changing so totally the nature of attacks and defences
both by sea and land and awakening so much art and skill in doing it
that the world cannot be too exact in ascertaining the precise time
of its discovery or too inquisitive in knowing what great man was the
discoverer and what occasions gave birth to it

I am far from controverting continued my uncle Toby what historians
agree in that in the year of our Lord 1380 under the reign of
Wencelaus son of Charles the Fourtha certain priest whose name
was Schwartz shewd the use of powder to the Venetians in their wars
against the Genoese but tis certain he was not the first because if
we are to believe Don Pedro the bishop of LeonHow came priests and
bishops an please your honour to trouble their heads so much about
gunpowder God knows said my uncle Tobyhis providence brings good
out of every thingand he avers in his chronicle of King Alphonsus
who reduced Toledo That in the year 1343 which was full thirtyseven
years before that time the secret of powder was well known and
employed with success both by Moors and Christians not only in their
seacombats at that period but in many of their most memorable sieges
in Spain and BarbaryAnd all the world knows that Friar Bacon had
wrote expressly about it and had generously given the world a receipt
to make it by above a hundred and fifty years before even Schwartz was
bornAnd that the Chinese added my uncle Toby embarrass us and all
accounts of it still more by boasting of the invention some hundreds
of years even before him

They are a pack of liars I believe cried Trim

They are somehow or other deceived said my uncle Toby in this
matter as is plain to me from the present miserable state of military
architecture amongst them which consists of nothing more than a fosse
with a brick wall without flanksand for what they gave us as a bastion
at each angle of it tis so barbarously constructed that it looks for
all the worldLike one of my seven castles an please your honour
quoth Trim

My uncle Toby tho in the utmost distress for a comparison most
courteously refused Trims offertill Trim telling him he had half a
dozen more in Bohemia which he knew not how to get off his handsmy
uncle Toby was so touchd with the pleasantry of heart of the
corporalthat he discontinued his dissertation upon gunpowderand
begged the corporal forthwith to go on with his story of the King of
Bohemia and his seven castles

The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles Continued

This unfortunate King of Bohemia said TrimWas he unfortunate then
cried my uncle Toby for he had been so wrapt up in his dissertation
upon gunpowder and other military affairs that tho he had desired
the corporal to go on yet the many interruptions he had given dwelt
not so strong upon his fancy as to account for the epithetWas he
unfortunate then Trim said my uncle Toby patheticallyThe corporal
wishing first the word and all its synonimas at the devil forthwith
began to run back in his mind the principal events in the King of
Bohemias story from every one of which it appearing that he was the
most fortunate man that ever existed in the worldit put the corporal
to a stand for not caring to retract his epithetand less to explain
itand least of all to twist his tale like men of lore to serve a
systemhe looked up in my uncle Tobys face for assistancebut seeing
it was the very thing my uncle Toby sat in expectation of himselfafter
a hum and a haw he went on

The King of Bohemia an please your honour replied the corporal
was unfortunate as thusThat taking great pleasure and delight in
navigation and all sort of sea affairsand there happening throughout
the whole kingdom of Bohemia to be no seaport town whatever

How the duce should thereTrim cried my uncle Toby for Bohemia being
totally inland it could have happend no otherwiseIt might said
Trim if it had pleased God

My uncle Toby never spoke of the being and natural attributes of God
but with diffidence and hesitation

I believe not replied my uncle Toby after some pausefor being
inland as I said and having Silesia and Moravia to the east Lusatia
and Upper Saxony to the north Franconia to the west and Bavaria to the
south Bohemia could not have been propelld to the sea without ceasing
to be Bohemianor could the sea on the other hand have come up to
Bohemia without overflowing a great part of Germany and destroying
millions of unfortunate inhabitants who could make no defence against
itScandalous cried TrimWhich would bespeak added my uncle Toby
mildly such a want of compassion in him who is the father of itthat
I think Trimthe thing could have happend no way

The corporal made the bow of unfeignd conviction and went on

Now the King of Bohemia with his queen and courtiers happening one fine
summers evening to walk outAye there the word happening is right
Trim cried my uncle Toby for the King of Bohemia and his queen might
have walkd out or let it alonetwas a matter of contingency which
might happen or not just as chance ordered it

King William was of an opinion an please your honour quoth Trim
that every thing was predestined for us in this world insomuch that
he would often say to his soldiers that every ball had its billet He
was a great man said my uncle TobyAnd I believe continued Trim to
this day that the shot which disabled me at the battle of Landen
was pointed at my knee for no other purpose but to take me out of his
service and place me in your honours where I should be taken so
much better care of in my old ageIt shall never Trim be construed
otherwise said my uncle Toby

The heart both of the master and the man were alike subject to sudden
overflowingsa short silence ensued

Besides said the corporal resuming the discoursebut in a gayer
accentif it had not been for that single shot I had never an please
your honour been in love

So thou wast once in love Trim said my uncle Toby smiling

Souse replied the corporalover head and ears an please your honour
Prithee when whereand how came it to passI never heard one word
of it before quoth my uncle TobyI dare say answered Trim that
every drummer and serjeants son in the regiment knew of itIts high
time I shouldsaid my uncle Toby

Your honour remembers with concern said the corporal the total rout
and confusion of our camp and army at the affair of Landen every one
was left to shift for himself and if it had not been for the regiments
of Wyndham Lumley and Galway which covered the retreat over the
bridge Neerspeeken the king himself could scarce have gained ithe was
pressd hard as your honour knows on every side of him

Gallant mortal cried my uncle Toby caught up with enthusiasmthis
moment now that all is lost I see him galloping across me corporal
to the left to bring up the remains of the English horse along with him
to support the right and tear the laurel from Luxembourgs brows if
yet tis possibleI see him with the knot of his scarfe just shot off
infusing fresh spirits into poor Galways regimentriding along the
linethen wheeling about and charging Conti at the head of itBrave
brave by heaven cried my uncle Tobyhe deserves a crownAs richly
as a thief a halter shouted Trim

My uncle Toby knew the corporals loyaltyotherwise the comparison
was not at all to his mindit did not altogether strike the corporals
fancy when he had made itbut it could not be recalldso he had
nothing to do but proceed

As the number of wounded was prodigious and no one had time to think
of any thing but his own safetyThough Talmash said my uncle Toby
brought off the foot with great prudenceBut I was left upon the field
said the corporal Thou wast so poor fellow replied my uncle TobySo
that it was noon the next day continued the corporal before I was
exchanged and put into a cart with thirteen or fourteen more in order
to be conveyd to our hospital

There is no part of the body an please your honour where a wound
occasions more intolerable anguish than upon the knee

Except the groin said my uncle Toby An please your honour replied
the corporal the knee in my opinion must certainly be the most acute
there being so many tendons and whatdyecallems all about it

It is for that reason quoth my uncle Toby that the groin is
infinitely more sensiblethere being not only as many tendons
and whatdyecallems for I know their names as little as thou
dostabout itbut moreover 

Mrs Wadman who had been all the time in her arbourinstantly stoppd
her breathunpinnd her mob at the chin and stood upon one leg

The dispute was maintained with amicable and equal force betwixt my
uncle Toby and Trim for some time till Trim at length recollecting that
he had often cried at his masters sufferings but never shed a tear
at his ownwas for giving up the point which my uncle Toby would not
allowTis a proof of nothing Trim said he but the generosity of thy
temper

So that whether the pain of a wound in the groin caeteris paribus is
greater than the pain of a wound in the kneeor

Whether the pain of a wound in the knee is not greater than the pain of
a wound in the groinare points which to this day remain unsettled



Chapter 4XLIV

The anguish of my knee continued the corporal was excessive in itself
and the uneasiness of the cart with the roughness of the roads which
were terribly cut upmaking bad still worseevery step was death to
me so that with the loss of blood and the want of caretaking of
me and a fever I felt coming on besidesPoor soul said my uncle
Tobyall together an please your honour was more than I could
sustain

I was telling my sufferings to a young woman at a peasants house where
our cart which was the last of the line had halted they had helpd
me in and the young woman had taken a cordial out of her pocket and
droppd it upon some sugar and seeing it had cheerd me she had given
it me a second and a third timeSo I was telling her an please your
honour the anguish I was in and was saying it was so intolerable
to me that I had much rather lie down upon the bed turning my face
towards one which was in the corner of the roomand die than go
onwhen upon her attempting to lead me to it I fainted away in her
arms She was a good soul as your honour said the corporal wiping his
eyes will hear

I thought love had been a joyous thing quoth my uncle Toby

Tis the most serious thing an please your honour sometimes that is
in the world

By the persuasion of the young woman continued the corporal the cart
with the wounded men set off without me she had assured them I should
expire immediately if I was put into the cart So when I came to
myselfI found myself in a still quiet cottage with no one but the
young woman and the peasant and his wife I was laid across the bed in
the corner of the room with my wounded leg upon a chair and the
young woman beside me holding the corner of her handkerchief dippd in
vinegar to my nose with one hand and rubbing my temples with the other

I took her at first for the daughter of the peasant for it was no
innso had offerd her a little purse with eighteen florins which my
poor brother Tom here Trim wipd his eyes had sent me as a token by a
recruit just before he set out for Lisbon

I never told your honour that piteous story yethere Trim wiped his
eyes a third time

The young woman calld the old man and his wife into the room to shew
them the money in order to gain me credit for a bed and what little
necessaries I should want till I should be in a condition to be got to
the hospitalCome then said she tying up the little purseIll be
your bankerbut as that office alone will not keep me employd Ill be
your nurse too

I thought by her manner of speaking this as well as by her dress which
I then began to consider more attentivelythat the young woman could
not be the daughter of the peasant

She was in black down to her toes with her hair conceald under a
cambric border laid close to her forehead she was one of those kind of
nuns an please your honour of which your honour knows there are
a good many in Flanders which they let go looseBy thy description
Trim said my uncle Toby I dare say she was a young Beguine of
which there are none to be found any where but in the Spanish
Netherlandsexcept at Amsterdamthey differ from nuns in this that
they can quit their cloister if they choose to marry they visit and
take care of the sick by professionI had rather for my own part they
did it out of goodnature

She often told me quoth Trim she did it for the love of ChristI
did not like itI believe Trim we are both wrong said my uncle
Tobywell ask Mr Yorick about it tonight at my brother Shandysso
put me in mind added my uncle Toby

The young Beguine continued the corporal had scarce given herself time
to tell me she would be my nurse when she hastily turned about to
begin the office of one and prepare something for meand in a short
timethough I thought it a long oneshe came back with flannels c
c and having fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours c and
made me a thin bason of gruel for my suppershe wishd me rest and
promised to be with me early in the morningShe wishd me an
please your honour what was not to be had My fever ran very high that
nighther figure made sad disturbance within meI was every moment
cutting the world in twoto give her half of itand every moment was I
crying That I had nothing but a knapsack and eighteen florins to share
with herThe whole night long was the fair Beguine like an angel
close by my bedside holding back my curtain and offering me
cordialsand I was only awakened from my dream by her coming there at
the hour promised and giving them in reality In truth she was scarce
ever from me and so accustomed was I to receive life from her hands
that my heart sickened and I lost colour when she left the room and
yet continued the corporal making one of the strangest reflections
upon it in the worldIt was not lovefor during the three weeks
she was almost constantly with me fomenting my knee with her hand
night and dayI can honestly say an please your honourthatonce

That was very odd Trim quoth my uncle Toby

I think so toosaid Mrs Wadman

It never did said the corporal



Chapter 4XLV

But tis no marvel continued the corporalseeing my uncle Toby
musing upon itfor Love an please your honour is exactly like war
in this that a soldier though he has escaped three weeks complete
oSaturday nightmay nevertheless be shot through his heart on
Sunday morningIt happened so here an please your honour with this
difference onlythat it was on Sunday in the afternoon when I fell
in love all at once with a sisseraraIt burst upon me an please your
honour like a bombscarce giving me time to say God bless me

I thought Trim said my uncle Toby a man never fell in love so very
suddenly

Yes an please your honour if he is in the way of itreplied Trim

I prithee quoth my uncle Toby inform me how this matter happened

With all pleasure said the corporal making a bow



Chapter 4XLVI

I had escaped continued the corporal all that time from falling
in love and had gone on to the end of the chapter had it not been
predestined otherwisethere is no resisting our fate

It was on a Sunday in the afternoon as I told your honour

The old man and his wife had walked out

Every thing was still and hush as midnight about the house

There was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the yard

When the fair Beguine came in to see me

My wound was then in a fair way of doing wellthe inflammation had been
gone off for some time but it was succeeded with an itching both above
and below my knee so insufferable that I had not shut my eyes the
whole night for it

Let me see it said she kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my
knee and laying her hand upon the part below itit only wants rubbing
a little said the Beguine so covering it with the bedclothes she
began with the forefinger of her right hand to rub under my knee
guiding her forefinger backwards and forwards by the edge of the
flannel which kept on the dressing

In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of her second fingerand
presently it was laid flat with the other and she continued rubbing in
that way round and round for a good while it then came into my head
that I should fall in loveI blushd when I saw how white a hand she
hadI shall never an please your honour behold another hand so white
whilst I live

Not in that place said my uncle Toby

Though it was the most serious despair in nature to the corporalhe
could not forbear smiling

The young Beguine continued the corporal perceiving it was of great
service to mefrom rubbing for some time with two fingersproceeded
to rub at length with threetill by little and little she brought
down the fourth and then rubbd with her whole hand I will never
say another word an please your honour upon hands againbut it was
softer than sattin

Prithee Trim commend it as much as thou wilt said my uncle Toby
I shall hear thy story with the more delightThe corporal thankd his
master most unfeignedly but having nothing to say upon the Beguines
hand but the same over againhe proceeded to the effects of it

The fair Beguine said the corporal continued rubbing with her whole
hand under my kneetill I feard her zeal would weary herI would do
a thousand times more said she for the love of ChristIn saying
which she passd her hand across the flannel to the part above my
knee which I had equally complaind of and rubbd it also

I perceivd then I was beginning to be in love

As she continued rubrubrubbingI felt it spread from under her hand
an please your honour to every part of my frame

The more she rubbd and the longer strokes she tookthe more the fire
kindled in my veinstill at length by two or three strokes longer than
the restmy passion rose to the highest pitchI seizd her hand

And then thou clappedst it to thy lips Trim said my uncle Tobyand
madest a speech

Whether the corporals amour terminated precisely in the way my uncle
Toby described it is not material it is enough that it contained in
it the essence of all the love romances which ever have been wrote since
the beginning of the world



Chapter 4XLVII

As soon as the corporal had finished the story of his amouror rather
my uncle Toby for himMrs Wadman silently sallied forth from her
arbour replaced the pin in her mob passd the wicker gate and
advanced slowly towards my uncle Tobys sentrybox the disposition
which Trim had made in my uncle Tobys mind was too favourable a crisis
to be let slippd

The attack was determind upon it was facilitated still more by my
uncle Tobys having ordered the corporal to wheel off the pioneers
shovel the spade the pickaxe the picquets and other military stores
which lay scatterd upon the ground where Dunkirk stoodThe corporal
had marchdthe field was clear

Now consider sir what nonsense it is either in fighting or writing
or any thing else whether in rhyme to it or not which a man has
occasion to doto act by plan for if ever Plan independent of all
circumstances deserved registering in letters of gold I mean in the
archives of Gothamit was certainly the Plan of Mrs Wadmans attack
of my uncle Toby in his sentrybox By PlanNow the plan hanging up in
it at this juncture being the Plan of Dunkirkand the tale of Dunkirk
a tale of relaxation it opposed every impression she could make and
besides could she have gone upon itthe manoeuvre of fingers and hands
in the attack of the sentrybox was so outdone by that of the fair
Beguines in Trims storythat just then that particular attack
however successful beforebecame the most heartless attack that could
be made

O let woman alone for this Mrs Wadman had scarce opend the
wickergate when her genius sported with the change of circumstances

She formed a new attack in a moment



Chapter 4XLVIII

I am half distracted captain Shandy said Mrs Wadman holding up her
cambrick handkerchief to her left eye as she approachd the door of my
uncle Tobys sentryboxa moteor sandor somethingI know not what
has got into this eye of minedo look into itit is not in the white

In saying which Mrs Wadman edged herself close in beside my uncle
Toby and squeezing herself down upon the corner of his bench she gave
him an opportunity of doing it without rising upDo look into itsaid
she

Honest soul thou didst look into it with as much innocency of heart
as ever child lookd into a rareeshewbox and twere as much a sin to
have hurt thee

If a man will be peeping of his own accord into things of that
natureIve nothing to say to it

My uncle Toby never did and I will answer for him that he would have
sat quietly upon a sofa from June to January which you know takes
in both the hot and cold months with an eye as fine as the Thracian
Rodopes Rodope Thracia tam inevitabili fascino instructa tam exacte
oculus intuens attraxit ut si in illam quis incidisset fieri non
posset quin capereturI know not who besides him without being
able to tell whether it was a black or blue one

The difficulty was to get my uncle Toby to look at one at all

Tis surmounted And

I see him yonder with his pipe pendulous in his hand and the ashes
falling out of itlookingand lookingthen rubbing his eyesand
looking again with twice the goodnature that ever Galileo lookd for a
spot in the sun

In vain for by all the powers which animate the organWidow Wadmans
left eye shines this moment as lucid as her rightthere is neither
mote or sand or dust or chaff or speck or particle of opake matter
floating in itThere is nothing my dear paternal uncle but one
lambent delicious fire furtively shooting out from every part of it in
all directions into thine

If thou lookest uncle Toby in search of this mote one moment
longerthou art undone



Chapter 4XLIX

An eye is for all the world exactly like a cannon in this respect That
it is not so much the eye or the cannon in themselves as it is the
carriage of the eyeand the carriage of the cannon by which both the
one and the other are enabled to do so much execution I dont think the
comparison a bad one However as tis made and placed at the head of
the chapter as much for use as ornament all I desire in return is
that whenever I speak of Mrs Wadmans eyes except once in the next
period that you keep it in your fancy

I protest Madam said my uncle Toby I can see nothing whatever in your
eye

It is not in the white said Mrs Wadman my uncle Toby lookd with
might and main into the pupil

Now of all the eyes which ever were createdfrom your own Madam up to
those of Venus herself which certainly were as venereal a pair of eyes
as ever stood in a headthere never was an eye of them all so fitted
to rob my uncle Toby of his repose as the very eye at which he was
lookingit was not Madam a rolling eyea romping or a wanton onenor
was it an eye sparklingpetulant or imperiousof high claims and
terrifying exactions which would have curdled at once that milk of
human nature of which my uncle Toby was made upbut twas an eye
full of gentle salutationsand soft responsesspeakingnot like the
trumpet stop of some illmade organ in which many an eye I talk to
holds coarse conversebut whispering softlike the last low accent of
an expiring saintHow can you live comfortless captain Shandy and
alone without a bosom to lean your head onor trust your cares to

It was an eye

But I shall be in love with it myself if I say another word about it

It did my uncle Tobys business



Chapter 4L

There is nothing shews the character of my father and my uncle Toby in
a more entertaining light than their different manner of deportment
under the same accidentfor I call not love a misfortune from a
persuasion that a mans heart is ever the better for itGreat God
what must my uncle Tobys have been when twas all benignity without
it

My father as appears from many of his papers was very subject to this
passion before he marriedbut from a little subacid kind of drollish
impatience in his nature whenever it befell him he would never submit
to it like a christian but would pish and huff and bounce and kick
and play the Devil and write the bitterest Philippicks against the eye
that ever man wrotethere is one in verse upon somebodys eye or other
that for two or three nights together had put him by his rest which in
his first transport of resentment against it he begins thus

 A Devil tisand mischief such doth work
 As never yet did Pagan Jew or Turk

This will be printed with my fathers Life of Socrates c c

In short during the whole paroxism my father was all abuse and foul
language approaching rather towards maledictiononly he did not do
it with as much method as Ernulphushe was too impetuous nor with
Ernulphuss policyfor tho my father with the most intolerant spirit
would curse both this and that and every thing under heaven which was
either aiding or abetting to his loveyet never concluded his chapter
of curses upon it without cursing himself in at the bargain as one of
the most egregious fools and coxcombs he would say that ever was let
loose in the world

My uncle Toby on the contrary took it like a lambsat still and
let the poison work in his veins without resistancein the sharpest
exacerbations of his wound like that on his groin he never dropt one
fretful or discontented wordhe blamed neither heaven nor earthor
thought or spoke an injurious thing of any body or any part of it he
sat solitary and pensive with his pipelooking at his lame legthen
whiffing out a sentimental heigh ho which mixing with the smoke
incommoded no one mortal

He took it like a lambI say

In truth he had mistook it at first for having taken a ride with my
father that very morning to save if possible a beautiful wood which
the dean and chapter were hewing down to give to the poor Mr Shandy
must mean the poor in spirit inasmuch as they divided the money amongst
themselves which said wood being in full view of my uncle Tobys
house and of singular service to him in his description of the battle
of Wynnendaleby trotting on too hastily to save itupon an uneasy
saddleworse horse c cit had so happened that the serous part
of the blood had got betwixt the two skins in the nethermost part of
my uncle Tobythe first shootings of which as my uncle Toby had no
experience of love he had taken for a part of the passiontill the
blister breaking in the one caseand the other remainingmy uncle Toby
was presently convinced that his wound was not a skindeep woundbut
that it had gone to his heart



Chapter 4LI

The world is ashamed of being virtuousmy uncle Toby knew little of the
world and therefore when he felt he was in love with widow Wadman he
had no conception that the thing was any more to be made a mystery of
than if Mrs Wadman had given him a cut with a gapd knife across his
finger Had it been otherwiseyet as he ever lookd upon Trim as a
humble friend and saw fresh reasons every day of his life to treat
him as suchit would have made no variation in the manner in which he
informed him of the affair

I am in love corporal quoth my uncle Toby



Chapter 4LII

In lovesaid the corporalyour honour was very well the day before
yesterday when I was telling your honour of the story of the King of
BohemiaBohemia said my uncle Tobymusing a long timeWhat became
of that story Trim

We lost it an please your honour somehow betwixt usbut your
honour was as free from love then as I amtwas just whilst thou
wentst off with the wheelbarrowwith Mrs Wadman quoth my uncle
TobyShe has left a ball hereadded my uncle Tobypointing to his
breast

She can no more an please your honour stand a siege than she can
flycried the corporal

But as we are neighbours Trimthe best way I think is to let her
know it civilly firstquoth my uncle Toby

Now if I might presume said the corporal to differ from your honour

Why else do I talk to thee Trim said my uncle Toby mildly

Then I would begin an please your honour with making a good
thundering attack upon her in returnand telling her civilly
afterwardsfor if she knows any thing of your honours being in love
before handLd help hershe knows no more at present of it Trim
said my uncle Tobythan the child unborn

Precious souls

Mrs Wadman had told it with all its circumstances to Mrs Bridget
twentyfour hours before and was at that very moment sitting in council
with her touching some slight misgivings with regard to the issue of
the affairs which the Devil who never lies dead in a ditch had put
into her headbefore he would allow half time to get quietly through
her Te Deum

I am terribly afraid said widow Wadman in case I should marry him
Bridgetthat the poor captain will not enjoy his health with the
monstrous wound upon his groin

It may not Madam be so very large replied Bridget as you thinkand
I believe besides added shethat tis dried up

I could like to knowmerely for his sake said Mrs Wadman

Well know and long and the broad of it in ten daysanswered Mrs
Bridget for whilst the captain is paying his addresses to youIm
confident Mr Trim will be for making love to meand Ill let him as
much as he willadded Bridgetto get it all out of him

The measures were taken at onceand my uncle Toby and the corporal went
on with theirs

Now quoth the corporal setting his left hand akimbo and giving such
a flourish with his right as just promised successand no moreif
your honour will give me leave to lay down the plan of this attack

Thou wilt please me by it Trim said my uncle Toby exceedinglyand
as I foresee thou must act in it as my aid de camp heres a crown
corporal to begin with to steep thy commission

Then an please your honour said the corporal making a bow first for
his commissionwe will begin with getting your honours laced clothes
out of the great campaigntrunk to be well aird and have the blue and
gold taken up at the sleevesand Ill put your white ramalliewig fresh
into pipesand send for a taylor to have your honours thin scarlet
breeches turnd

I had better take the red plush ones quoth my uncle TobyThey will
be too clumsysaid the corporal



Chapter 4LIII

Thou wilt get a brush and a little chalk to my swordTwill be only
in your honours way replied Trim



Chapter 4LIV

But your honours two razors shall be new setand I will get
my Montero cap furbishd up and put on poor lieutenant Le Fevers
regimental coat which your honour gave me to wear for his sakeand as
soon as your honour is clean shavedand has got your clean shirt
on with your blue and gold or your fine scarletsometimes one and
sometimes totherand every thing is ready for the attackwell march
up boldly as if twas to the face of a bastion and whilst your honour
engages Mrs Wadman in the parlour to the rightIll attack Mrs
Bridget in the kitchen to the left and having seizd the pass
Ill answer for it said the corporal snapping his fingers over his
headthat the day is our own

I wish I may but manage it right said my uncle Tobybut I declare
corporal I had rather march up to the very edge of a trench

A woman is quite a different thingsaid the corporal

I suppose so quoth my uncle Toby



Chapter 4LV

If any thing in this world which my father said could have provoked my
uncle Toby during the time he was in love it was the perverse use my
father was always making of an expression of Hilarion the hermit who
in speaking of his abstinence his watchings flagellations and
other instrumental parts of his religionwould saytho with more
facetiousness than became an hermitThat they were the means he used
to make his ass meaning his body leave off kicking

It pleased my father well it was not only a laconick way of
expressingbut of libelling at the same time the desires and
appetites of the lower part of us so that for many years of my fathers
life twas his constant mode of expressionhe never used the word
passions oncebut ass always instead of themSo that he might be said
truly to have been upon the bones or the back of his own ass or else
of some other mans during all that time

I must here observe to you the difference betwixt My fathers ass and my
hobbyhorsein order to keep characters as separate as may be in our
fancies as we go along

For my hobbyhorse if you recollect a little is no way a vicious
beast he has scarce one hair or lineament of the ass about himTis
the sporting little fillyfolly which carries you out for the present
houra maggot a butterfly a picture a fiddlestickan uncle Tobys
siegeor an any thing which a man makes a shift to get astride on to
canter it away from the cares and solicitudes of lifeTis as useful
a beast as is in the whole creationnor do I really see how the world
could do without it

But for my fathers assoh mount himmount himmount himthats
three times is it notmount him nottis a beast concupiscentand
foul befal the man who does not hinder him from kicking



Chapter 4LVI

Well dear brother Toby said my father upon his first seeing him after
he fell in loveand how goes it with your Asse

Now my uncle Toby thinking more of the part where he had had the
blister than of Hilarions metaphorand our preconceptions having you
know as great a power over the sounds of words as the shapes of things
he had imagined that my father who was not very ceremonious in his
choice of words had enquired after the part by its proper name so
notwithstanding my mother doctor Slop and Mr Yorick were sitting in
the parlour he thought it rather civil to conform to the term my father
had made use of than not When a man is hemmd in by two indecorums and
must commit one of emI always observelet him chuse which he will
the world will blame himso I should not be astonished if it blames my
uncle Toby

My Ae quoth my uncle Toby is much betterbrother ShandyMy father
had formed great expectations from his Asse in this onset and would
have brought him on again but doctor Slop setting up an intemperate
laughand my mother crying out L bless usit drove my fathers
Asse off the fieldand the laugh then becoming generalthere was no
bringing him back to the charge for some time

And so the discourse went on without him

Every body said my mother says you are in love brother Tobyand we
hope it is true

I am as much in love sister I believe replied my uncle Toby as any
man usually isHumph said my fatherand when did you know it quoth
my mother

When the blister broke replied my uncle Toby

My uncle Tobys reply put my father into good temperso he chargd o
foot



Chapter 4LVII

As the ancients agree brother Toby said my father that there are two
different and distinct kinds of love according to the different parts
which are affected by itthe Brain or LiverI think when a man is in
love it behoves him a little to consider which of the two he is fallen
into

What signifies it brother Shandy replied my uncle Toby which of the
two it is provided it will but make a man marry and love his wife and
get a few children

A few children cried my father rising out of his chair and looking
full in my mothers face as he forced his way betwixt hers and doctor
Slopsa few children cried my father repeating my uncle Tobys words
as he walkd to and fro

Not my dear brother Toby cried my father recovering himself all at
once and coming close up to the back of my uncle Tobys chairnot
that I should be sorry hadst thou a scoreon the contrary I should
rejoiceand be as kind Toby to every one of them as a father

My uncle Toby stole his hand unperceived behind his chair to give my
fathers a squeeze

Nay moreover continued he keeping hold of my uncle Tobys handso
much dost thou possess my dear Toby of the milk of human nature and
so little of its asperitiestis piteous the world is not peopled by
creatures which resemble thee and was I an Asiatic monarch added
my father heating himself with his new projectI would oblige thee
provided it would not impair thy strengthor dry up thy radical
moisture too fastor weaken thy memory or fancy brother Toby which
these gymnics inordinately taken are apt to doelse dear Toby I would
procure thee the most beautiful woman in my empire and I would oblige
thee nolens volens to beget for me one subject every month

As my father pronounced the last word of the sentencemy mother took a
pinch of snuff

Now I would not quoth my uncle Toby get a child nolens volens that
is whether I would or no to please the greatest prince upon earth

And twould be cruel in me brother Toby to compel thee said my
fatherbut tis a case put to shew thee that it is not thy begetting
a childin case thou shouldst be ablebut the system of Love and
Marriage thou goest upon which I would set thee right in

There is at least said Yorick a great deal of reason and plain sense
in captain Shandys opinion of love and tis amongst the illspent
hours of my life which I have to answer for that I have read so many
flourishing poets and rhetoricians in my time from whom I never could
extract so muchI wish Yorick said my father you had read Plato
for there you would have learnt that there are two LovesI know there
were two Religions replied Yorick amongst the ancientsonefor the
vulgar and another for the learnedbut I think One Love might have
served both of them very well

I could not replied my fatherand for the same reasons for of
these Loves according to Ficinuss comment upon Velasius the one is
rational

the other is naturalthe first ancientwithout motherwhere Venus
had nothing to do the second begotten of Jupiter and Dione

Pray brother quoth my uncle Toby what has a man who believes in
God to do with this My father could not stop to answer for fear of
breaking the thread of his discourse

This latter continued he partakes wholly of the nature of Venus

The first which is the golden chain let down from heaven excites
to love heroic which comprehends in it and excites to the desire of
philosophy and truththe second excites to desire simply

I think the procreation of children as beneficial to the world said
Yorick as the finding out the longitude

To be sure said my mother love keeps peace in the world

In the housemy dear I own

It replenishes the earth said my mother

But it keeps heaven emptymy dear replied my father

Tis Virginity cried Slop triumphantly which fills paradise

Well pushd nun quoth my father



Chapter 4LVIII

My father had such a skirmishing cutting kind of a slashing way with
him in his disputations thrusting and ripping and giving every one a
stroke to remember him by in his turnthat if there were twenty people
in companyin less than half an hour he was sure to have every one of
em against him

What did not a little contribute to leave him thus without an ally was
that if there was any one post more untenable than the rest he would be
sure to throw himself into it and to do him justice when he was
once there he would defend it so gallantly that twould have been a
concern either to a brave man or a goodnatured one to have seen him
driven out

Yorick for this reason though he would often attack himyet could
never bear to do it with all his force

Doctor Slops Virginity in the close of the last chapter had got him
for once on the right side of the rampart and he was beginning to blow
up all the convents in Christendom about Slops ears when corporal Trim
came into the parlour to inform my uncle Toby that his thin scarlet
breeches in which the attack was to be made upon Mrs Wadman would not
do for that the taylor in ripping them up in order to turn them had
found they had been turnd beforeThen turn them again brother said
my father rapidly for there will be many a turning of em yet
before alls done in the affairThey are as rotten as dirt said
the corporalThen by all means said my father bespeak a new pair
brotherfor though I know continued my father turning himself to the
company that widow Wadman has been deeply in love with my brother Toby
for many years and has used every art and circumvention of woman to
outwit him into the same passion yet now that she has caught himher
fever will be passd its height

She has gained her point

In this case continued my father which Plato I am persuaded never
thought ofLove you see is not so much a Sentiment as a Situation
into which a man enters as my brother Toby would do into a corpsno
matter whether he loves the service or nobeing once in ithe acts as
if he did and takes every step to shew himself a man of prowesse

The hypothesis like the rest of my fathers was plausible enough and
my uncle Toby had but a single word to object to itin which Trim stood
ready to second himbut my father had not drawn his conclusion

For this reason continued my father stating the case over
againnotwithstanding all the world knows that Mrs Wadman affects my
brother Tobyand my brother Toby contrariwise affects Mrs Wadman and
no obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night
yet will I answer for it that this selfsame tune will not be playd
this twelvemonth

We have taken our measures badly quoth my uncle Toby looking up
interrogatively in Trims face

I would lay my Monterocap said TrimNow Trims Monterocap as I once
told you was his constant wager and having furbishd it up that
very night in order to go upon the attackit made the odds look more
considerableI would lay an please your honour my Monterocap to a
shillingwas it proper continued Trim making a bow to offer a wager
before your honours

There is nothing improper in it said my fathertis a mode of
expression for in saying thou wouldst lay thy Monterocap to a
shillingall thou meanest is thisthat thou believest

Now What dost thou believe

That widow Wadman an please your worship cannot hold it out ten
days

And whence cried Slop jeeringly hast thou all this knowledge of
woman friend

By falling in love with a popish clergywoman said Trim

Twas a Beguine said my uncle Toby

Doctor Slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction and my
father taking that very crisis to fall in helterskelter upon the whole
order of Nuns and Beguines a set of silly fusty baggagesSlop could
not stand itand my uncle Toby having some measures to take about his
breechesand Yorick about his fourth general divisionin order for
their several attacks next daythe company broke up and my father
being left alone and having half an hour upon his hands betwixt that
and bedtime he called for pen ink and paper and wrote my uncle Toby
the following letter of instructions

My dear brother Toby

What I am going to say to thee is upon the nature of women and of
lovemaking to them and perhaps it is as well for theetho not so
well for methat thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon
that head and that I am able to write it to thee

Had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lotsand
thou no sufferer by the knowledge I had been well content that thou
shouldst have dippd the pen this moment into the ink instead of
myself but that not being the caseMrs Shandy being now close beside
me preparing for bedI have thrown together without order and just as
they have come into my mind such hints and documents as I deem may be
of use to thee intending in this to give thee a token of my love not
doubting my dear Toby of the manner in which it will be accepted

In the first place with regard to all which concerns religion in the
affairthough I perceive from a glow in my cheek that I blush as
I begin to speak to thee upon the subject as well knowing
notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy how few of its offices thou
neglectestyet I would remind thee of one during the continuance of
thy courtship in a particular manner which I would not have omitted
and that is never to go forth upon the enterprize whether it be in
the morning or the afternoon without first recommending thyself to the
protection of Almighty God that he may defend thee from the evil one

Shave the whole top of thy crown clean once at least every four or five
days but oftner if convenient lest in taking off thy wig before her
thro absence of mind she should be able to discover how much has been
cut away by Timehow much by Trim

Twere better to keep ideas of baldness out of her fancy

Always carry it in thy mind and act upon it as a sure maxim Toby

That women are timid And tis well they areelse there would be no
dealing with them

Let not thy breeches be too tight or hang too loose about thy thighs
like the trunkhose of our ancestors

A just medium prevents all conclusions

Whatever thou hast to say be it more or less forget not to utter it
in a low soft tone of voice Silence and whatever approaches it weaves
dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain For this cause if thou canst
help it never throw down the tongs and poker

Avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse with
her and do whatever lies in thy power at the same time to keep
her from all books and writings which tend thereto there are some
devotional tracts which if thou canst entice her to read overit will
be well but suffer her not to look into Rabelais or Scarron or Don
Quixote

They are all books which excite laughter and thou knowest dear Toby
that there is no passion so serious as lust

Stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt before thou enterest her parlour

And if thou art permitted to sit upon the same sopha with her and she
gives thee occasion to lay thy hand upon hersbeware of taking itthou
canst not lay thy hand on hers but she will feel the temper of thine
Leave that and as many other things as thou canst quite undetermined
by so doing thou wilt have her curiosity on thy side and if she is not
conquered by that and thy Asse continues still kicking which there is
great reason to supposeThou must begin with first losing a few
ounces of blood below the ears according to the practice of the ancient
Scythians who cured the most intemperate fits of the appetite by that
means

Avicenna after this is for having the part anointed with the syrup of
hellebore using proper evacuations and purgesand I believe rightly
But thou must eat little or no goats flesh nor red deernor even
foals flesh by any means and carefully abstainthat is as much as
thou canst from peacocks cranes coots didappers and waterhens

As for thy drinkI need not tell thee it must be the infusion of
Vervain and the herb Hanea of which Aelian relates such effectsbut
if thy stomach palls with itdiscontinue it from time to time taking
cucumbers melons purslane waterlillies woodbine and lettice in
the stead of them

There is nothing further for thee which occurs to me at present

Unless the breaking out of a fresh warSo wishing every thing dear
Toby for best

I rest thy affectionate brother

Walter Shandy



Chapter 4LIX

Whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions my uncle Toby
and the corporal were busy in preparing every thing for the attack As
the turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid aside at least for
the present there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next
morning so accordingly it was resolvd upon for eleven oclock

Come my dear said my father to my mothertwill be but like a brother
and sister if you and I take a walk down to my brother Tobysto
countenance him in this attack of his

My uncle Toby and the corporal had been accoutred both some time when
my father and mother enterd and the clock striking eleven were that
moment in motion to sally forthbut the account of this is worth more
than to be wove into the fag end of the eighth Alluding to the first
edition volume of such a work as thisMy father had no time but to
put the letter of instructions into my uncle Tobys coatpocketand
join with my mother in wishing his attack prosperous

I could like said my mother to look through the keyhole out of
curiosityCall it by its right name my dear quoth my father

And look through the keyhole as long as you will



Chapter 4LX

I call all the powers of time and chance which severally check us in
our careers in this world to bear me witness that I could never yet
get fairly to my uncle Tobys amours till this very moment that my
mothers curiosity as she stated the affairor a different impulse
in her as my father would have itwished her to take a peep at them
through the keyhole

Call it my dear by its right name quoth my father and look through
the keyhole as long as you will

Nothing but the fermentation of that little subacid humour which I
have often spoken of in my fathers habit could have vented such an
insinuationhe was however frank and generous in his nature and at all
times open to conviction so that he had scarce got to the last word of
this ungracious retort when his conscience smote him

My mother was then conjugally swinging with her left arm twisted under
his right in such wise that the inside of her hand rested upon the
back of hisshe raised her fingers and let them fallit could scarce
be calld a tap or if it was a taptwould have puzzled a casuist to
say whether twas a tap of remonstrance or a tap of confession
my father who was all sensibilities from head to foot classd it
rightConscience redoubled her blowhe turnd his face suddenly the
other way and my mother supposing his body was about to turn with it in
order to move homewards by a cross movement of her right leg keeping
her left as its centre brought herself so far in front that as he
turned his head he met her eyeConfusion again he saw a thousand
reasons to wipe out the reproach and as many to reproach himselfa
thin blue chill pellucid chrystal with all its humours so at rest
the least mote or speck of desire might have been seen at the bottom of
it had it existedit did notand how I happen to be so lewd myself
particularly a little before the vernal and autumnal equinoxesHeaven
above knowsMy mothermadamwas so at no time either by nature by
institution or example

A temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in all months
of the year and in all critical moments both of the day and night
alike nor did she superinduce the least heat into her humours from the
manual effervescencies of devotional tracts which having little or no
meaning in them nature is ofttimes obliged to find oneAnd as for
my fathers example twas so far from being either aiding or abetting
thereunto that twas the whole business of his life to keep all
fancies of that kind out of her headNature had done her part to have
spared him this trouble and what was not a little inconsistent my
father knew itAnd here am I sitting this 12th day of August 1766 in
a purple jerkin and yellow pair of slippers without either wig or cap
on a most tragicomical completion of his prediction That I should
neither think nor act like any other mans child upon that very
account

The mistake in my father was in attacking my mothers motive instead
of the act itself for certainly keyholes were made for other purposes
and considering the act as an act which interfered with a true
proposition and denied a keyhole to be what it wasit became a
violation of nature and was so far you see criminal

It is for this reason an please your Reverences That keyholes are
the occasions of more sin and wickedness than all other holes in this
world put together

which leads me to my uncle Tobys amours



Chapter 4LXI

Though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle
Tobys great ramalliewig into pipes yet the time was too short to
produce any great effects from it it had lain many years squeezed up in
the corner of his old campaign trunk and as bad forms are not so
easy to be got the better of and the use of candleends not so well
understood it was not so pliable a business as one would have wished
The corporal with cheary eye and both arms extended had fallen back
perpendicular from it a score times to inspire it if possible with
a better airhad Spleen given a look at it twould have cost her
ladyship a smileit curld every where but where the corporal would
have it and where a buckle or two in his opinion would have done it
honour he could as soon have raised the dead

Such it wasor rather such would it have seemd upon any other
brow but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle Tobys
assimilated every thing around it so sovereignly to itself and Nature
had moreover wrote Gentleman with so fair a hand in every line of his
countenance that even his tarnishd goldlaced hat and huge cockade of
flimsy taffeta became him and though not worth a button in themselves
yet the moment my uncle Toby put them on they became serious objects
and altogether seemd to have been picked up by the hand of Science to
set him off to advantage

Nothing in this world could have cooperated more powerfully towards
this than my uncle Tobys blue and goldhad not Quantity in some
measure been necessary to Grace in a period of fifteen or sixteen years
since they had been made by a total inactivity in my uncle Tobys life
for he seldom went further than the bowlinggreenhis blue and gold had
become so miserably too straight for him that it was with the utmost
difficulty the corporal was able to get him into them the taking them
up at the sleeves was of no advantageThey were laced however
down the back and at the seams of the sides c in the mode of King
Williams reign and to shorten all description they shone so bright
against the sun that morning and had so metallick and doughty an
air with them that had my uncle Toby thought of attacking in armour
nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination

As for the thin scarlet breeches they had been unrippd by the taylor
between the legs and left at sixes and sevens

Yes Madambut let us govern our fancies It is enough they were
held impracticable the night before and as there was no alternative in
my uncle Tobys wardrobe he sallied forth in the red plush

The corporal had arrayd himself in poor Le Fevers regimental coat and
with his hair tuckd up under his Monterocap which he had furbishd up
for the occasion marchd three paces distant from his master a whiff
of military pride had puffd out his shirt at the wrist and upon that
in a black leather thong clippd into a tassel beyond the knot hung the
corporals stickmy uncle Toby carried his cane like a pike

It looks well at least quoth my father to himself



Chapter 4LXII

My uncle Toby turnd his head more than once behind him to see how he
was supported by the corporal and the corporal as oft as he did it
gave a slight flourish with his stickbut not vapouringly and with the
sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement bid his honour never
fear

Now my uncle Toby did fear and grievously too he knew not as my
father had reproachd him so much as the right end of a Woman from the
wrong and therefore was never altogether at his ease near any one of
themunless in sorrow or distress then infinite was his pity nor
would the most courteous knight of romance have gone further at least
upon one leg to have wiped away a tear from a womans eye and yet
excepting once that he was beguiled into it by Mrs Wadman he had
never looked stedfastly into one and would often tell my father in the
simplicity of his heart that it was almost if not about as bad as
taking bawdy

And suppose it is my father would say



Chapter 4LXIII

She cannot quoth my uncle Toby halting when they had marchd up to
within twenty paces of Mrs Wadmans doorshe cannot corporal take it
amiss

She will take it an please your honour said the corporal just as
the Jews widow at Lisbon took it of my brother Tom

And how was that quoth my uncle Toby facing quite about to the
corporal

Your honour replied the corporal knows of Toms misfortunes but this
affair has nothing to do with them any further than this That if Tom
had not married the widowor had it pleased God after their marriage
that they had but put pork into their sausages the honest soul
had never been taken out of his warm bed and draggd to the
inquisitionTis a cursed placeadded the corporal shaking his
headwhen once a poor creature is in he is in an please your
honour for ever

Tis very true said my uncle Toby looking gravely at Mrs Wadmans
house as he spoke

Nothing continued the corporal can be so sad as confinement for
lifeor so sweet an please your honour as liberty

Nothing Trimsaid my uncle Toby musing

Whilst a man is freecried the corporal giving a flourish with his
stick thus

squiggly line diagonally across the page

A thousand of my fathers most subtle syllogisms could not have said
more for celibacy

My uncle Toby lookd earnestly towards his cottage and his
bowlinggreen

The corporal had unwarily conjured up the Spirit of calculation with his
wand and he had nothing to do but to conjure him down again with his
story and in this form of Exorcism most unecclesiastically did the
corporal do it



Chapter 4LXIV

As Toms place an please your honour was easyand the weather
warmit put him upon thinking seriously of settling himself in the
world and as it fell out about that time that a Jew who kept a sausage
shop in the same street had the ill luck to die of a strangury and
leave his widow in possession of a rousing tradeTom thought as every
body in Lisbon was doing the best he could devise for himself there
could be no harm in offering her his service to carry it on so without
any introduction to the widow except that of buying a pound of sausages
at her shopTom set outcounting the matter thus within himself as
he walkd along that let the worst come of it that could he should at
least get a pound of sausages for their worthbut if things went
well he should be set up inasmuch as he should get not only a pound of
sausagesbut a wife anda sausage shop an please your honour into
the bargain

Every servant in the family from high to low wishd Tom success and I
can fancy an please your honour I see him this moment with his white
dimity waistcoat and breeches and hat a little o one side passing
jollily along the street swinging his stick with a smile and a
chearful word for every body he metBut alas Tom thou smilest no
more cried the corporal looking on one side of him upon the ground as
if he apostrophised him in his dungeon

Poor fellow said my uncle Toby feelingly

He was an honest lighthearted lad an please your honour as ever
blood warmd

Then he resembled thee Trim said my uncle Toby rapidly

The corporal blushd down to his fingers endsa tear of sentimental
bashfulnessanother of gratitude to my uncle Tobyand a tear of sorrow
for his brothers misfortunes started into his eye and ran sweetly
down his cheek together my uncle Tobys kindled as one lamp does at
another and taking hold of the breast of Trims coat which had been
that of Le Fevers as if to ease his lame leg but in reality to
gratify a finer feelinghe stood silent for a minute and a half at the
end of which he took his hand away and the corporal making a bow went
on with his story of his brother and the Jews widow



Chapter 4LXV

When Tom an please your honour got to the shop there was nobody in
it but a poor negro girl with a bunch of white feathers slightly tied
to the end of a long cane flapping away fliesnot killing themTis
a pretty picture said my uncle Tobyshe had suffered persecution
Trim and had learnt mercy

She was good an please your honour from nature as well as from
hardships and there are circumstances in the story of that poor
friendless slut that would melt a heart of stone said Trim and some
dismal winters evening when your honour is in the humour they shall
be told you with the rest of Toms story for it makes a part of it

Then do not forget Trim said my uncle Toby

A negro has a soul an please your honour said the corporal
doubtingly

I am not much versed corporal quoth my uncle Toby in things of that
kind but I suppose God would not leave him without one any more than
thee or me

It would be putting one sadly over the head of another quoth the
corporal

It would so said my uncle Toby Why then an please your honour is a
black wench to be used worse than a white one

I can give no reason said my uncle Toby

Only cried the corporal shaking his head because she has no one to
stand up for her

Tis that very thing Trim quoth my uncle Tobywhich recommends her
to protectionand her brethren with her tis the fortune of war which
has put the whip into our hands nowwhere it may be hereafter heaven
knowsbut be it where it will the brave Trim will not use it
unkindly

God forbid said the corporal

Amen responded my uncle Toby laying his hand upon his heart

The corporal returned to his story and went onbut with an
embarrassment in doing it which here and there a reader in this world
will not be able to comprehend for by the many sudden transitions all
along from one kind and cordial passion to another in getting thus far
on his way he had lost the sportable key of his voice which gave sense
and spirit to his tale he attempted twice to resume it but could not
please himself so giving a stout hem to rally back the retreating
spirits and aiding nature at the same time with his left arm a kimbo
on one side and with his right a little extended supporting her on
the otherthe corporal got as near the note as he could and in that
attitude continued his story



Chapter 4LXVI

As Tom an please your honour had no business at that time with the
Moorish girl he passed on into the room beyond to talk to the Jews
widow about loveand this pound of sausages and being as I have told
your honour an open chearyhearted lad with his character wrote in his
looks and carriage he took a chair and without much apology but with
great civility at the same time placed it close to her at the table
and sat down

There is nothing so awkward as courting a woman an please your
honour whilst she is making sausagesSo Tom began a discourse upon
them first gravelyas how they were madewith what meats herbs
and spicesThen a little gaylyas With what skinsand if they
never burstWhether the largest were not the bestand so ontaking
care only as he went along to season what he had to say upon sausages
rather under than overthat he might have room to act in

It was owing to the neglect of that very precaution said my uncle Toby
laying his hand upon Trims shoulder that Count De la Motte lost the
battle of Wynendale he pressed too speedily into the wood which if he
had not done Lisle had not fallen into our hands nor Ghent and Bruges
which both followed her example it was so late in the year continued
my uncle Toby and so terrible a season came on that if things had
not fallen out as they did our troops must have perishd in the open
field

Why therefore may not battles an please your honour as well as
marriages be made in heavenmy uncle Toby mused

Religion inclined him to say one thing and his high idea of military
skill tempted him to say another so not being able to frame a reply
exactly to his mindmy uncle Toby said nothing at all and the corporal
finished his story

As Tom perceived an please your honour that he gained ground and
that all he had said upon the subject of sausages was kindly taken he
went on to help her a little in making themFirst by taking hold of
the ring of the sausage whilst she stroked the forced meat down with her
handthen by cutting the strings into proper lengths and holding them
in his hand whilst she took them out one by onethen by putting them
across her mouth that she might take them out as she wanted themand
so on from little to more till at last he adventured to tie the sausage
himself whilst she held the snout

Now a widow an please your honour always chuses a second husband as
unlike the first as she can so the affair was more than half settled in
her mind before Tom mentioned it

She made a feint however of defending herself by snatching up a
sausageTom instantly laid hold of another

But seeing Toms had more gristle in it

She signed the capitulationand Tom sealed it and there was an end of
the matter



Chapter 4LXVII

All womankind continued Trim commenting upon his story from
the highest to the lowest an please your honour love jokes the
difficulty is to know how they chuse to have them cut and there is no
knowing that but by trying as we do with our artillery in the field
by raising or letting down their breeches till we hit the mark

I like the comparison said my uncle Toby better than the thing
itself

Because your honour quoth the corporal loves glory more than
pleasure

I hope Trim answered my uncle Toby I love mankind more than either
and as the knowledge of arms tends so apparently to the good and quiet
of the worldand particularly that branch of it which we have practised
together in our bowlinggreen has no object but to shorten the strides
of Ambition and intrench the lives and fortunes of the few from the
plunderings of the manywhenever that drum beats in our ears I
trust corporal we shall neither of us want so much humanity and
fellowfeeling as to face about and march

In pronouncing this my uncle Toby faced about and marchd firmly as
at the head of his companyand the faithful corporal shouldering his
stick and striking his hand upon his coatskirt as he took his first
stepmarchd close behind him down the avenue

Now what can their two noddles be about cried my father to my
motherby all thats strange they are besieging Mrs Wadman in
form and are marching round her house to mark out the lines of
circumvallation

I dare say quoth my motherBut stop dear Sirfor what my mother
dared to say upon the occasionand what my father did say upon itwith
her replies and his rejoinders shall be read perused paraphrased
commented and descanted uponor to say it all in a word shall be
thumbd over by Posterity in a chapter apartI say by Posterityand
care not if I repeat the word againfor what has this book done more
than the Legation of Moses or the Tale of a Tub that it may not swim
down the gutter of Time along with them

I will not argue the matter Time wastes too fast every letter I trace
tells me with what rapidity Life follows my pen the days and hours of
it more precious my dear Jenny than the rubies about thy neck are
flying over our heads like light clouds of a windy day never to return
moreevery thing presses onwhilst thou art twisting that locksee
it grows grey and every time I kiss thy hand to bid adieu and every
absence which follows it are preludes to that eternal separation which
we are shortly to make

Heaven have mercy upon us both



Chapter 4LXVIII

Now for what the world thinks of that ejaculationI would not give a
groat



Chapter 4LXIX

My mother had gone with her left arm twisted in my fathers right till
they had got to the fatal angle of the old garden wall where Doctor
Slop was overthrown by Obadiah on the coachhorse as this was directly
opposite to the front of Mrs Wadmans house when my father came to it
he gave a look across and seeing my uncle Toby and the corporal within
ten paces of the door he turnd aboutLet us just stop a moment
quoth my father and see with what ceremonies my brother Toby and his
man Trim make their first entryit will not detain us added my father
a single minute

No matter if it be ten minutes quoth my mother

It will not detain us half one said my father

The corporal was just then setting in with the story of his brother
Tom and the Jews widow the story went onand onit had episodes in
itit came back and went onand on again there was no end of itthe
reader found it very long

G help my father he pishd fifty times at every new attitude and
gave the corporals stick with all its flourishings and danglings to
as many devils as chose to accept of them

When issues of events like these my father is waiting for are hanging
in the scales of fate the mind has the advantage of changing the
principle of expectation three times without which it would not have
power to see it out

Curiosity governs the first moment and the second moment is all
oeconomy to justify the expence of the firstand for the third fourth
fifth and sixth moments and so on to the day of judgmenttis a point
of Honour

I need not be told that the ethic writers have assigned this all to
Patience but that Virtue methinks has extent of dominion sufficient
of her own and enough to do in it without invading the few dismantled
castles which Honour has left him upon the earth

My father stood it out as well as he could with these three auxiliaries
to the end of Trims story and from thence to the end of my uncle
Tobys panegyrick upon arms in the chapter following it when seeing
that instead of marching up to Mrs Wadmans door they both faced
about and marchd down the avenue diametrically opposite to his
expectationhe broke out at once with that little subacid soreness of
humour which in certain situations distinguished his character from
that of all other men



Chapter 4LXX

Now what can their two noddles be about cried my fatherc

I dare say said my mother they are making fortifications

Not on Mrs Wadmans premises cried my father stepping back

I suppose not quoth my mother

I wish said my father raising his voice the whole science of
fortification at the devil with all its trumpery of saps mines
blinds gabions faussebrays and cuvetts

They are foolish thingssaid my mother

Now she had a way which by the bye I would this moment give away my
purple jerkin and my yellow slippers into the bargain if some of your
reverences would imitateand that was never to refuse her assent and
consent to any proposition my father laid before her merely because she
did not understand it or had no ideas of the principal word or term of
art upon which the tenet or proposition rolled She contented herself
with doing all that her godfathers and godmothers promised for herbut
no more and so would go on using a hard word twenty years togetherand
replying to it too if it was a verb in all its moods and tenses
without giving herself any trouble to enquire about it

This was an eternal source of misery to my father and broke the neck
at the first setting out of more good dialogues between them than
could have done the most petulant contradictionthe few which survived
were the better for the cuvetts

They are foolish things said my mother

Particularly the cuvetts replied my father

Tis enoughhe tasted the sweet of triumphand went on

Not that they are properly speaking Mrs Wadmans premises said my
father partly correcting himselfbecause she is but tenant for life

That makes a great differencesaid my mother

In a fools head replied my father

Unless she should happen to have a childsaid my mother

But she must persuade my brother Toby first to get her one

To be sure Mr Shandy quoth my mother

Though if it comes to persuasionsaid my fatherLord have mercy upon
them

Amen said my mother piano

Amen cried my father fortissime

Amen said my mother againbut with such a sighing cadence of personal
pity at the end of it as discomfited every fibre about my fatherhe
instantly took out his almanack but before he could untie it Yoricks
congregation coming out of church became a full answer to one half
of his business with itand my mother telling him it was a sacrament
dayleft him as little in doubt as to the other partHe put his
almanack into his pocket

The first Lord of the Treasury thinking of ways and means could not
have returned home with a more embarrassed look



Chapter 4LXXI

Upon looking back from the end of the last chapter and surveying the
texture of what has been wrote it is necessary that upon this page and
the three following a good quantity of heterogeneous matter be inserted
to keep up that just balance betwixt wisdom and folly without which a
book would not hold together a single year nor is it a poor creeping
digression which but for the name of a man might continue as well
going on in the kings highway which will do the businessno if it
is to be a digression it must be a good frisky one and upon a frisky
subject too where neither the horse or his rider are to be caught but
by rebound

The only difficulty is raising powers suitable to the nature of
the service Fancy is capriciousWit must not be searched forand
Pleasantry goodnatured slut as she is will not come in at a call was
an empire to be laid at her feet

The best way for a man is to say his prayers

Only if it puts him in mind of his infirmities and defects as well
ghostly as bodilyfor that purpose he will find himself rather worse
after he has said them than beforefor other purposes better

For my own part there is not a way either moral or mechanical under
heaven that I could think of which I have not taken with myself in this
case sometimes by addressing myself directly to the soul herself and
arguing the point over and over again with her upon the extent of her
own faculties

I never could make them an inch the wider

Then by changing my system and trying what could be made of it upon the
body by temperance soberness and chastity These are good quoth
I in themselvesthey are good absolutelythey are good
relativelythey are good for healththey are good for happiness in
this worldthey are good for happiness in the next

In short they were good for every thing but the thing wanted and there
they were good for nothing but to leave the soul just as heaven made
it as for the theological virtues of faith and hope they give it
courage but then that snivelling virtue of Meekness as my father would
always call it takes it quite away again so you are exactly where you
started

Now in all common and ordinary cases there is nothing which I have
found to answer so well as this

Certainly if there is any dependence upon Logic and that I am not
blinded by selflove there must be something of true genius about me
merely upon this symptom of it that I do not know what envy is
for never do I hit upon any invention or device which tendeth to the
furtherance of good writing but I instantly make it public willing
that all mankind should write as well as myself

Which they certainly will when they think as little



Chapter 4LXXII

Now in ordinary cases that is when I am only stupid and the thoughts
rise heavily and pass gummous through my pen

Or that I am got I know not how into a cold unmetaphorical vein of
infamous writing and cannot take a plumblift out of it for my soul so
must be obliged to go on writing like a Dutch commentator to the end of
the chapter unless something be done

I never stand conferring with pen and ink one moment for if a pinch
of snuff or a stride or two across the room will not do the business
for meI take a razor at once and having tried the edge of it upon
the palm of my hand without further ceremony except that of first
lathering my beard I shave it off taking care only if I do leave a
hair that it be not a grey one this done I change my shirtput on a
better coatsend for my last wigput my topaz ring upon my finger and
in a word dress myself from one end to the other of me after my best
fashion

Now the devil in hell must be in it if this does not do for consider
Sir as every man chuses to be present at the shaving of his own beard
though there is no rule without an exception and unavoidably sits
overagainst himself the whole time it is doing in case he has a hand
in itthe Situation like all others has notions of her own to put
into the brain

I maintain it the conceits of a roughbearded man are seven years
more terse and juvenile for one single operation and if they did not
run a risk of being quite shaved away might be carried up by continual
shavings to the highest pitch of sublimityHow Homer could write with
so long a beard I dont knowand as it makes against my hypothesis I
as little careBut let us return to the Toilet

Ludovicus Sorbonensis makes this entirely an affair of the body Greek
as he calls itbut he is deceived the soul and body are jointsharers
in every thing they get A man cannot dress but his ideas get clothd
at the same time and if he dresses like a gentleman every one of them
stands presented to his imagination genteelized along with himso that
he has nothing to do but take his pen and write like himself

For this cause when your honours and reverences would know whether I
writ clean and fit to be read you will be able to judge full as well by
looking into my Laundresss bill as my book there is one single month
in which I can make it appear that I dirtied one and thirty shirts with
clean writing and after all was more abusd cursed criticisd and
confounded and had more mystic heads shaken at me for what I had
wrote in that one month than in all the other months of that year put
together

But their honours and reverences had not seen my bills



Chapter 4LXXIII

As I never had any intention of beginning the Digression I am making
all this preparation for till I come to the 74th chapterI have this
chapter to put to whatever use I think properI have twenty this moment
ready for itI could write my chapter of Buttonholes in it

Or my chapter of Pishes which should follow them

Or my chapter of Knots in case their reverences have done with
themthey might lead me into mischief the safest way is to follow
the track of the learned and raise objections against what I have been
writing tho I declare beforehand I know no more than my heels how to
answer them

And first it may be said there is a pelting kind of thersitical
satire as black as the very ink tis wrote withand by the bye
whoever says so is indebted to the mustermaster general of the Grecian
army for suffering the name of so ugly and foulmouthd a man as
Thersites to continue upon his rollfor it has furnishd him with an
epithetin these productions he will urge all the personal washings
and scrubbings upon earth do a sinking genius no sort of goodbut
just the contrary inasmuch as the dirtier the fellow is the better
generally he succeeds in it

To this I have no other answerat least readybut that the Archbishop
of Benevento wrote his nasty Romance of the Galatea as all the world
knows in a purple coat waistcoat and purple pair of breeches and
that the penance set him of writing a commentary upon the book of the
Revelations as severe as it was lookd upon by one part of the world
was far from being deemd so by the other upon the single account of
that Investment

Another objection to all this remedy is its want of universality
forasmuch as the shaving part of it upon which so much stress is
laid by an unalterable law of nature excludes one half of the species
entirely from its use all I can say is that female writers whether of
England or of France must een go without it

As for the Spanish ladiesI am in no sort of distress



Chapter 4LXXIV

The seventyfourth chapter is come at last and brings nothing with it
but a sad signature of How our pleasures slip from under us in this
world

For in talking of my digressionI declare before heaven I have made it
What a strange creature is mortal man said she

Tis very true said Ibut twere better to get all these things out of
our heads and return to my uncle Toby



Chapter 4LXXV

When my uncle Toby and the corporal had marched down to the bottom of
the avenue they recollected their business lay the other way so they
faced about and marched up straight to Mrs Wadmans door

I warrant your honour said the corporal touching his Monterocap with
his hand as he passed him in order to give a knock at the doorMy
uncle Toby contrary to his invariable way of treating his faithful
servant said nothing good or bad the truth was he had not altogether
marshald his ideas he wishd for another conference and as the
corporal was mounting up the three steps before the doorhe hemd
twicea portion of my uncle Tobys most modest spirits fled at each
expulsion towards the corporal he stood with the rapper of the door
suspended for a full minute in his hand he scarce knew why Bridget
stood perdue within with her finger and her thumb upon the latch
benumbd with expectation and Mrs Wadman with an eye ready to be
deflowered again sat breathless behind the windowcurtain of her
bedchamber watching their approach

Trim said my uncle Tobybut as he articulated the word the minute
expired and Trim let fall the rapper

My uncle Toby perceiving that all hopes of a conference were knockd on
the head by itwhistled Lillabullero



Chapter 4LXXVI

As Mrs Bridgets finger and thumb were upon the latch the corporal did
not knock as often as perchance your honours taylorI might have taken
my example something nearer home for I owe mine some five and twenty
pounds at least and wonder at the mans patience

But this is nothing at all to the world only tis a cursed thing to
be in debt and there seems to be a fatality in the exchequers of some
poor princes particularly those of our house which no Economy can
bind down in irons for my own part Im persuaded there is not any one
prince prelate pope or potentate great or small upon earth more
desirous in his heart of keeping straight with the world than I amor
who takes more likely means for it I never give above half a guineaor
walk with bootsor cheapen toothpicksor lay out a shilling upon a
bandbox the year round and for the six months Im in the country Im
upon so small a scale that with all the good temper in the world I
outdo Rousseau a bar lengthfor I keep neither man or boy or horse
or cow or dog or cat or any thing that can eat or drink except a
thin poor piece of a Vestal to keep my fire in and who has generally
as bad an appetite as myselfbut if you think this makes a philosopher
of meI would not my good people give a rush for your judgments

True philosophybut there is no treating the subject whilst my uncle is
whistling Lillabullero

Let us go into the house

Chapter 4LXXIX

two blank paragraphs

You shall see the very place Madam said my uncle Toby

Mrs Wadman blushdlookd towards the doorturnd paleblushd
slightly againrecoverd her natural colourblushd worse than ever
which for the sake of the unlearned reader I translate thus

Ld I cannot look at it

What would the world say if I lookd at it

I should drop down if I lookd at it

I wish I could look at it

There can be no sin in looking at it

I will look at it

Whilst all this was running through Mrs Wadmans imagination my uncle
Toby had risen from the sopha and got to the other side of the parlour
door to give Trim an order about it in the passage

I believe it is in the garret said my uncle TobyI saw it there
an please your honour this morning answered TrimThen prithee
step directly for it Trim said my uncle Toby and bring it into the
parlour

The corporal did not approve of the orders but most cheerfully obeyed
them The first was not an act of his willthe second was so he put
on his Monterocap and went as fast as his lame knee would let him My
uncle Toby returned into the parlour and sat himself down again upon
the sopha

You shall lay your finger upon the placesaid my uncle TobyI will
not touch it however quoth Mrs Wadman to herself

This requires a second translationit shews what little knowledge is
got by mere wordswe must go up to the first springs

Now in order to clear up the mist which hangs upon these three pages I
must endeavour to be as clear as possible myself

Rub your hands thrice across your foreheadsblow your nosescleanse

Now give me all the help you can



Chapter 4LXXX

As there are fifty different ends counting all ends inas well civil
as religious for which a woman takes a husband the first sets about
and carefully weighs then separates and distinguishes in her mind
which of all that number of ends is hers then by discourse enquiry
argumentation and inference she investigates and finds out whether
she has got hold of the right oneand if she hasthen by pulling it
gently this way and that way she further forms a judgment whether it
will not break in the drawing

The imagery under which Slawkenbergius impresses this upon the readers
fancy in the beginning of his third Decad is so ludicrous that the
honour I bear the sex will not suffer me to quote itotherwise it is
not destitute of humour

She first saith Slawkenbergius stops the asse and holding his halter
in her left hand lest he should get away she thrusts her right hand
into the very bottom of his pannier to search for itFor whatyoull
not know the sooner quoth Slawkenbergius for interrupting me

I have nothing good Lady but empty bottles says the asse

Im loaded with tripes says the second

And thou art little better quoth she to the third for nothing is
there in thy panniers but trunkhose and pantoflesand so to the fourth
and fifth going on one by one through the whole string till coming to
the asse which carries it she turns the pannier upside down looks at
itconsiders itsamples itmeasures itstretches itwets itdries
itthen takes her teeth both to the warp and weft of it

Of what for the love of Christ

I am determined answered Slawkenbergius that all the powers upon earth
shall never wring that secret from my breast



Chapter 4LXXXI

We live in a world beset on all sides with mysteries and riddlesand
so tis no matterelse it seems strange that Nature who makes every
thing so well to answer its destination and seldom or never errs
unless for pastime in giving such forms and aptitudes to whatever
passes through her hands that whether she designs for the plough the
caravan the cartor whatever other creature she models be it but an
asses foal you are sure to have the thing you wanted and yet at the
same time should so eternally bungle it as she does in making so simple
a thing as a married man

Whether it is in the choice of the clayor that it is frequently
spoiled in the baking by an excess of which a husband may turn out too
crusty you know on one handor not enough so through defect of heat
on the otheror whether this great Artificer is not so attentive to the
little Platonic exigences of that part of the species for whose use she
is fabricating thisor that her Ladyship sometimes scarce knows what
sort of a husband will doI know not we will discourse about it after
supper

It is enough that neither the observation itself or the reasoning upon
it are at all to the purposebut rather against it since with regard
to my uncle Tobys fitness for the marriage state nothing was ever
better she had formed him of the best and kindliest clayhad temperd
it with her own milk and breathed into it the sweetest spiritshe had
made him all gentle generous and humaneshe had filled his heart with
trust and confidence and disposed every passage which led to it for
the communication of the tenderest officesshe had moreover considered
the other causes for which matrimony was ordained

And accordingly

The Donation was not defeated by my uncle Tobys wound

Now this last article was somewhat apocryphal and the Devil who is the
great disturber of our faiths in this world had raised scruples in Mrs
Wadmans brain about it and like a true devil as he was had done his
own work at the same time by turning my uncle Tobys Virtue thereupon
into nothing but empty bottles tripes trunkhose and pantofles



Chapter 4LXXXII

Mrs Bridget had pawnd all the little stock of honour a poor
chambermaid was worth in the world that she would get to the bottom
of the affair in ten days and it was built upon one of the most
concessible postulata in nature namely that whilst my uncle Toby was
making love to her mistress the corporal could find nothing better to
do than make love to herAnd Ill let him as much as he will said
Bridget to get it out of him

Friendship has two garments an outer and an under one Bridget was
serving her mistresss interests in the oneand doing the thing which
most pleased herself in the other so had as many stakes depending
upon my uncle Tobys wound as the Devil himselfMrs Wadman had but
oneand as it possibly might be her last without discouraging Mrs
Bridget or discrediting her talents was determined to play her cards
herself

She wanted not encouragement a child might have lookd into his
handthere was such a plainness and simplicity in his playing out what
trumps he hadwith such an unmistrusting ignorance of the tenaceand
so naked and defenceless did he sit upon the same sopha with widow
Wadman that a generous heart would have wept to have won the game of
him

Let us drop the metaphor



Chapter 4LXXXIII

And the story tooif you please for though I have all along been
hastening towards this part of it with so much earnest desire as
well knowing it to be the choicest morsel of what I had to offer to the
world yet now that I am got to it any one is welcome to take my pen
and go on with the story for me that willI see the difficulties of the
descriptions Im going to giveand feel my want of powers

It is one comfort at least to me that I lost some fourscore ounces
of blood this week in a most uncritical fever which attacked me at the
beginning of this chapter so that I have still some hopes remaining
it may be more in the serous or globular parts of the blood than in the
subtile aura of the brainbe it which it willan Invocation can do no
hurtand I leave the affair entirely to the invoked to inspire or to
inject me according as he sees good

The Invocation

Gentle Spirit of sweetest humour who erst did sit upon the easy pen of
my beloved Cervantes Thou who glidedst daily through his lattice and
turnedst the twilight of his prison into noonday brightness by thy
presencetingedst his little urn of water with heavensent nectar and
all the time he wrote of Sancho and his master didst cast thy mystic
mantle oer his witherd stump He lost his hand at the battle of
Lepanto and wide extended it to all the evils of his life

Turn in hither I beseech theebehold these breechesthey are all
I have in worldthat piteous rent was given them at Lyons

My shirts see what a deadly schism has happend amongst emfor the
laps are in Lombardy and the rest of em hereI never had but six
and a cunning gypsey of a laundress at Milan cut me off the forelaps of
fiveTo do her justice she did it with some considerationfor I was
returning out of Italy

And yet notwithstanding all this and a pistol tinderbox which was
moreover filchd from me at Sienna and twice that I payd five Pauls
for two hard eggs once at Raddicoffini and a second time at CapuaI
do not think a journey through France and Italy provided a man keeps
his temper all the way so bad a thing as some people would make you
believe there must be ups and downs or how the duce should we get
into vallies where Nature spreads so many tables of entertainmentTis
nonsense to imagine they will lend you their voitures to be shaken to
pieces for nothing and unless you pay twelve sous for greasing your

expect too muchand for the livre or two above par for your suppers and

Disappointment sitting drooping upon the eye of your fair Hostess and
her Damsels in the gateway at your departureand besides my dear
Sir you get a sisterly kiss of each of em worth a poundat least I
did

For my uncle Tobys amours running all the way in my head they had
the same effect upon me as if they had been my ownI was in the most
perfect state of bounty and goodwill and felt the kindliest harmony
vibrating within me with every oscillation of the chaise alike so that
whether the roads were rough or smooth it made no difference every
thing I saw or had to do with touchd upon some secret spring either of
sentiment or rapture

They were the sweetest notes I ever heard and I instantly let down
the foreglass to hear them more distinctlyTis Maria said the
postillion observing I was listeningPoor Maria continued he leaning
his body on one side to let me see her for he was in a line betwixt
us is sitting upon a bank playing her vespers upon her pipe with her
little goat beside her

The young fellow utterd this with an accent and a look so perfectly in
tune to a feeling heart that I instantly made a vow I would give him a
fourandtwenty sous piece when I got to Moulins

And who is poor Maria said I

The love and piety of all the villages around us said the
postillionit is but three years ago that the sun did not shine upon
so fair so quickwitted and amiable a maid and better fate did Maria
deserve than to have her Banns forbid by the intrigues of the curate
of the parish who published them

He was going on when Maria who had made a short pause put the pipe to
her mouth and began the air againthey were the same notesyet were
ten times sweeter It is the evening service to the Virgin said the
young manbut who has taught her to play itor how she came by her
pipe no one knows we think that heaven has assisted her in both
for ever since she has been unsettled in her mind it seems her only
consolationshe has never once had the pipe out of her hand but plays
that service upon it almost night and day

The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and natural
eloquence that I could not help decyphering something in his face above
his condition and should have sifted out his history had not poor
Maria taken such full possession of me

We had got up by this time almost to the bank where Maria was sitting
she was in a thin white jacket with her hair all but two tresses
drawn up into a silknet with a few olive leaves twisted a little
fantastically on one sideshe was beautiful and if ever I felt the
full force of an honest heartache it was the moment I saw her

God help her poor damsel above a hundred masses said the
postillion have been said in the several parish churches and convents
around for herbut without effect we have still hopes as she is
sensible for short intervals that the Virgin at last will restore her
to herself but her parents who know her best are hopeless upon that
score and think her senses are lost for ever

As the postillion spoke this Maria made a cadence so melancholy so
tender and querulous that I sprung out of the chaise to help her and
found myself sitting betwixt her and her goat before I relapsed from my
enthusiasm

Maria lookd wistfully for some time at me and then at her goatand
then at meand then at her goat again and so on alternately

Well Maria said I softlyWhat resemblance do you find

I do entreat the candid reader to believe me that it was from the
humblest conviction of what a Beast man isthat I asked the question
and that I would not have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the
venerable presence of Misery to be entitled to all the wit that ever
Rabelais scatterdand yet I own my heart smote me and that I so
smarted at the very idea of it that I swore I would set up for Wisdom
and utter grave sentences the rest of my daysand nevernever attempt
again to commit mirth with man woman or child the longest day I had
to live

As for writing nonsense to themI believe there was a reservebut that
I leave to the world

Adieu Mariaadieu poor hapless damselsome time but not now I
may hear thy sorrows from thy own lipsbut I was deceived for that
moment she took her pipe and told me such a tale of woe with it that I
rose up and with broken and irregular steps walkd softly to my chaise

What an excellent inn at Moulins



Chapter 4LXXXIV

When we have got to the end of this chapter but not before we must all
turn back to the two blank chapters on the account of which my honour
has lain bleeding this half hourI stop it by pulling off one of my
yellow slippers and throwing it with all my violence to the opposite
side of my room with a declaration at the heel of it

That whatever resemblance it may bear to half the chapters which are
written in the world or for aught I know may be now writing in itthat
it was as casual as the foam of Zeuxis his horse besides I look upon a
chapter which has only nothing in it with respect and considering what
worse things there are in the worldThat it is no way a proper subject
for satire

Why then was it left so And here without staying for my reply shall
I be called as many blockheads numsculs doddypoles dunderheads
ninnyhammers goosecaps joltheads nincompoops and shtabedsand
other unsavoury appellations as ever the cakebakers of Lerne cast in
the teeth of King Garangantans shepherdsAnd Ill let them do it
as Bridget said as much as they please for how was it possible they
should foresee the necessity I was under of writing the 84th chapter of
my book before the 77th c

So I dont take it amissAll I wish is that it may be a lesson to
the world to let people tell their stories their own way



The Seventyseventh Chapter

As Mrs Bridget opened the door before the corporal had well given the
rap the interval betwixt that and my uncle Tobys introduction into the
parlour was so short that Mrs Wadman had but just time to get from
behind the curtainlay a Bible upon the table and advance a step or
two towards the door to receive him

My uncle Toby saluted Mrs Wadman after the manner in which women were
saluted by men in the year of our Lord God one thousand seven hundred
and thirteenthen facing about he marchd up abreast with her to the
sopha and in three plain wordsthough not before he was sat downnor
after he was sat downbut as he was sitting down told her he was in
loveso that my uncle Toby strained himself more in the declaration
than he needed

Mrs Wadman naturally looked down upon a slit she had been darning up
in her apron in expectation every moment that my uncle Toby would go
on but having no talents for amplification and Love moreover of all
others being a subject of which he was the least a masterWhen he had
told Mrs Wadman once that he loved her he let it alone and left the
matter to work after its own way

My father was always in raptures with this system of my uncle Tobys as
he falsely called it and would often say that could his brother Toby
to his processe have added but a pipe of tobaccohe had wherewithal to
have found his way if there was faith in a Spanish proverb towards the
hearts of half the women upon the globe

My uncle Toby never understood what my father meant nor will I presume
to extract more from it than a condemnation of an error which the bulk
of the world lie underbut the French every one of em to a man who
believe in it almost as much as the Real Presence That talking of
love is making it

I would as soon set about making a blackpudding by the same receipt

Let us go on Mrs Wadman sat in expectation my uncle Toby would do so
to almost the first pulsation of that minute wherein silence on one
side or the other generally becomes indecent so edging herself a
little more towards him and raising up her eyes sub blushing as
she did itshe took up the gauntletor the discourse if you like it
better and communed with my uncle Toby thus

The cares and disquietudes of the marriage state quoth Mrs Wadman
are very great I suppose sosaid my uncle Toby and therefore when
a person continued Mrs Wadman is so much at his ease as you areso
happy captain Shandy in yourself your friends and your amusementsI
wonder what reasons can incline you to the state

They are written quoth my uncle Toby in the CommonPrayer Book

Thus far my uncle Toby went on warily and kept within his depth
leaving Mrs Wadman to sail upon the gulph as she pleased

As for childrensaid Mrs Wadmanthough a principal end perhaps of
the institution and the natural wish I suppose of every parentyet
do not we all find they are certain sorrows and very uncertain
comforts and what is there dear sir to pay one for the
heartachswhat compensation for the many tender and disquieting
apprehensions of a suffering and defenceless mother who brings them into
life I declare said my uncle Toby smit with pity I know of none
unless it be the pleasure which it has pleased God

A fiddlestick quoth she



Chapter 4the Seventyeighth

Now there are such an infinitude of notes tunes cants chants airs
looks and accents with which the word fiddlestick may be pronounced in
all such causes as this every one of em impressing a sense and meaning
as different from the other as dirt from cleanlinessThat Casuists
for it is an affair of conscience on that score reckon up no less than
fourteen thousand in which you may do either right or wrong

Mrs Wadman hit upon the fiddlestick which summoned up all my uncle
Tobys modest blood into his cheeksso feeling within himself that he
had somehow or other got beyond his depth he stopt short and without
entering further either into the pains or pleasures of matrimony he
laid his hand upon his heart and made an offer to take them as they
were and share them along with her

When my uncle Toby had said this he did not care to say it again
so casting his eye upon the Bible which Mrs Wadman had laid upon the
table he took it up and popping dear soul upon a passage in it
of all others the most interesting to himwhich was the siege of
Jerichohe set himself to read it overleaving his proposal of
marriage as he had done his declaration of love to work with her after
its own way Now it wrought neither as an astringent or a loosener nor
like opium or bark or mercury or buckthorn or any one drug which
nature had bestowed upon the worldin short it workd not at all in
her and the cause of that was that there was something working there
beforeBabbler that I am I have anticipated what it was a dozen times
but there is fire still in the subjectallons



Chapter 4LXXXV

It is natural for a perfect stranger who is going from London to
Edinburgh to enquire before he sets out how many miles to York which
is about the half waynor does any body wonder if he goes on and asks
about the corporation c

It was just as natural for Mrs Wadman whose first husband was all his
time afflicted with a Sciatica to wish to know how far from the hip
to the groin and how far she was likely to suffer more or less in her
feelings in the one case than in the other

She had accordingly read Drakes anatomy from one end to the other She
had peeped into Wharton upon the brain and borrowed Graaf This must be
a mistake in Mr Shandy for Graaf wrote upon the pancreatick juice
and the parts of generation upon the bones and muscles but could make
nothing of it

She had reasond likewise from her own powerslaid down theoremsdrawn
consequences and come to no conclusion

To clear up all she had twice asked Doctor Slop if poor captain
Shandy was ever likely to recover of his wound

He is recovered Doctor Slop would say

What quite

Quite madam

But what do you mean by a recovery Mrs Wadman would say

Doctor Slop was the worst man alive at definitions and so Mrs Wadman
could get no knowledge in short there was no way to extract it but
from my uncle Toby himself

There is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which lulls
Suspicion to restand I am half persuaded the serpent got pretty near
it in his discourse with Eve for the propensity in the sex to be
deceived could not be so great that she should have boldness to hold
chat with the devil without itBut there is an accent of humanityhow
shall I describe ittis an accent which covers the part with a
garment and gives the enquirer a right to be as particular with it as
your bodysurgeon

Was it without remission

Was it more tolerable in bed

Could he lie on both sides alike with it

Was he able to mount a horse

Was motion bad for it et caetera were so tenderly spoke to and so
directed towards my uncle Tobys heart that every item of them sunk
ten times deeper into it than the evils themselvesbut when Mrs Wadman
went round about by Namur to get at my uncle Tobys groin and engaged
him to attack the point of the advanced counterscarp and pele mele with
the Dutch to take the counterguard of St Roch sword in handand then
with tender notes playing upon his ear led him all bleeding by the
hand out of the trench wiping her eye as he was carried to his
tentHeaven Earth Seaall was lifted upthe springs of nature rose
above their levelsan angel of mercy sat besides him on the sophahis
heart glowd with fireand had he been worth a thousand he had lost
every heart of them to Mrs Wadman

And whereabouts dear sir quoth Mrs Wadman a little categorically
did you receive this sad blowIn asking this question Mrs Wadman
gave a slight glance towards the waistband of my uncle Tobys red plush
breeches expecting naturally as the shortest reply to it that
my uncle Toby would lay his forefinger upon the placeIt fell out
otherwisefor my uncle Toby having got his wound before the gate of St
Nicolas in one of the traverses of the trench opposite to the salient
angle of the demibastion of St Roch he could at any time stick a pin
upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing when the stone
struck him this struck instantly upon my uncle Tobys sensoriumand
with it struck his large map of the town and citadel of Namur and its
environs which he had purchased and pasted down upon a board by the
corporals aid during his long illnessit had lain with other military
lumber in the garret ever since and accordingly the corporal was
detached to the garret to fetch it

My uncle Toby measured off thirty toises with Mrs Wadmans scissars
from the returning angle before the gate of St Nicolas and with such
a virgin modesty laid her finger upon the place that the goddess of
Decency if then in beingif not twas her shadeshook her head
and with a finger wavering across her eyesforbid her to explain the
mistake

Unhappy Mrs Wadman

For nothing can make this chapter go off with spirit but an apostrophe
to theebut my heart tells me that in such a crisis an apostrophe
is but an insult in disguise and ere I would offer one to a woman in
distresslet the chapter go to the devil provided any damnd critic in
keeping will be but at the trouble to take it with him



Chapter 4LXXXVI

My uncle Tobys Map is carried down into the kitchen



Chapter 4LXXXVII

And here is the Maesand this is the Sambre said the corporal
pointing with his right hand extended a little towards the map and his
left upon Mrs Bridgets shoulderbut not the shoulder next himand
this said he is the town of Namurand this the citadeland there
lay the Frenchand here lay his honour and myselfand in this cursed
trench Mrs Bridget quoth the corporal taking her by the hand did he
receive the wound which crushd him so miserably hereIn pronouncing
which he slightly pressd the back of her hand towards the part he felt
forand let it fall

We thought Mr Trim it had been more in the middlesaid Mrs
Bridget

That would have undone us for eversaid the corporal

And left my poor mistress undone too said Bridget

The corporal made no reply to the repartee but by giving Mrs Bridget a
kiss

Comecomesaid Bridgetholding the palm of her left hand parallel to
the plane of the horizon and sliding the fingers of the other over it
in a way which could not have been done had there been the least wart
or protruberanceTis every syllable of it false cried the corporal
before she had half finished the sentence

I know it to be fact said Bridget from credible witnesses

Upon my honour said the corporal laying his hand upon his heart
and blushing as he spoke with honest resentmenttis a story Mrs
Bridget as false as hellNot said Bridget interrupting him that
either I or my mistress care a halfpenny about it whether tis so or
noonly that when one is married one would chuse to have such a thing
by one at least

It was somewhat unfortunate for Mrs Bridget that she had begun the
attack with her manual exercise for the corporal instantly



Chapter 4LXXXVIII

It was like the momentary contest in the moist eyelids of an April
morning Whether Bridget should laugh or cry

She snatchd up a rollingpintwas ten to one she had laughd

She laid it downshe cried and had one single tear of em but tasted
of bitterness full sorrowful would the corporals heart have been that
he had used the argument but the corporal understood the sex a quart
major to a terce at least better than my uncle Toby and accordingly he
assailed Mrs Bridget after this manner

I know Mrs Bridget said the corporal giving her a most respectful
kiss that thou art good and modest by nature and art withal so
generous a girl in thyself that if I know thee rightly thou wouldst
not wound an insect much less the honour of so gallant and worthy a
soul as my master wast thou sure to be made a countess ofbut thou
hast been set on and deluded dear Bridget as is often a womans case
to please others more than themselves

Bridgets eyes poured down at the sensations the corporal excited

Tell metell me then my dear Bridget continued the corporal
taking hold of her hand which hung down dead by her sideand giving a
second kisswhose suspicion has misled thee

Bridget sobbd a sob or twothen opend her eyesthe corporal wiped
em with the bottom of her apronshe then opend her heart and told him
all



Chapter 4LXXXIX

My uncle Toby and the corporal had gone on separately with their
operations the greatest part of the campaign and as effectually cut
off from all communication of what either the one or the other had been
doing as if they had been separated from each other by the Maes or the
Sambre

My uncle Toby on his side had presented himself every afternoon in his
red and silver and blue and gold alternately and sustained an infinity
of attacks in them without knowing them to be attacksand so had
nothing to communicate

The corporal on his side in taking Bridget by it had gaind
considerable advantagesand consequently had much to communicatebut
what were the advantagesas well as what was the manner by which he had
seizd them required so nice an historian that the corporal durst not
venture upon it and as sensible as he was of glory would rather have
been contented to have gone bareheaded and without laurels for ever
than torture his masters modesty for a single moment

Best of honest and gallant servantsBut I have apostrophizd thee
Trim once beforeand could I apotheosize thee also that is to say
with good companyI would do it without ceremony in the very next page



Chapter 4XC

Now my uncle Toby had one evening laid down his pipe upon the table
and was counting over to himself upon his finger ends beginning at his
thumb all Mrs Wadmans perfections one by one and happening two or
three times together either by omitting some or counting others twice
over to puzzle himself sadly before he could get beyond his middle
fingerPrithee Trim said he taking up his pipe againbring me a
pen and ink Trim brought paper also

Take a full sheetTrim said my uncle Toby making a sign with his pipe
at the same time to take a chair and sit down close by him at the table
The corporal obeyedplaced the paper directly before himtook a pen
and dippd it in the ink

She has a thousand virtues Trim said my uncle Toby

Am I to set them down an please your honour quoth the corporal

But they must be taken in their ranks replied my uncle Toby for of
them all Trim that which wins me most and which is a security for
all the rest is the compassionate turn and singular humanity of her
characterI protest added my uncle Toby looking up as he protested
it towards the top of the ceilingThat was I her brother Trim a
thousand fold she could not make more constant or more tender enquiries
after my sufferingsthough now no more

The corporal made no reply to my uncle Tobys protestation but by a
short coughhe dippd the pen a second time into the inkhorn and my
uncle Toby pointing with the end of his pipe as close to the top of the
sheet at the left hand corner of it as he could get itthe corporal
wrote down the word HUMANITYthus

Prithee corporal said my uncle Toby as soon as Trim had done ithow
often does Mrs Bridget enquire after the wound on the cap of thy knee
which thou receivedst at the battle of Landen

She never an please your honour enquires after it at all

That corporal said my uncle Toby with all the triumph the goodness of
his nature would permitThat shews the difference in the character
of the mistress and maidhad the fortune of war allotted the same
mischance to me Mrs Wadman would have enquired into every circumstance
relating to it a hundred timesShe would have enquired an please your
honour ten times as often about your honours groinThe pain Trim is
equally excruciatingand Compassion has as much to do with the one as
the other

God bless your honour cried the corporalwhat has a womans
compassion to do with a wound upon the cap of a mans knee had your
honours been shot into ten thousand splinters at the affair of Landen
Mrs Wadman would have troubled her head as little about it as Bridget
because added the corporal lowering his voice and speaking very
distinctly as he assigned his reason

The knee is such a distance from the main bodywhereas the groin your
honour knows is upon the very curtain of the place

My uncle Toby gave a long whistlebut in a note which could scarce be
heard across the table

The corporal had advanced too far to retirein three words he told the
rest

My uncle Toby laid down his pipe as gently upon the fender as if it had
been spun from the unravellings of a spiders web

Let us go to my brother Shandys said he



Chapter 4XCI

There will be just time whilst my uncle Toby and Trim are walking to
my fathers to inform you that Mrs Wadman had some moons before this
made a confident of my mother and that Mrs Bridget who had the burden
of her own as well as her mistresss secret to carry had got happily
delivered of both to Susannah behind the gardenwall

As for my mother she saw nothing at all in it to make the least bustle
aboutbut Susannah was sufficient by herself for all the ends and
purposes you could possibly have in exporting a family secret for she
instantly imparted it by signs to Jonathanand Jonathan by tokens to
the cook as she was basting a loin of mutton the cook sold it with some
kitchenfat to the postillion for a groat who truckd it with the dairy
maid for something of about the same valueand though whisperd in the
hayloft Fame caught the notes with her brazen trumpet and sounded
them upon the housetopIn a word not an old woman in the village or
five miles round who did not understand the difficulties of my uncle
Tobys siege and what were the secret articles which had delayed the
surrender

My father whose way was to force every event in nature into an
hypothesis by which means never man crucified Truth at the rate he
didhad but just heard of the report as my uncle Toby set out and
catching fire suddenly at the trespass done his brother by it was
demonstrating to Yorick notwithstanding my mother was sitting bynot
only That the devil was in women and that the whole of the affair was
lust but that every evil and disorder in the world of what kind or
nature soever from the first fall of Adam down to my uncle Tobys
inclusive was owing one way or other to the same unruly appetite

Yorick was just bringing my fathers hypothesis to some temper when
my uncle Toby entering the room with marks of infinite benevolence and
forgiveness in his looks my fathers eloquence rekindled against the
passionand as he was not very nice in the choice of his words when
he was wrothas soon as my uncle Toby was seated by the fire and had
filled his pipe my father broke out in this manner



Chapter 4XCII

That provision should be made for continuing the race of so great
so exalted and godlike a Being as manI am far from denyingbut
philosophy speaks freely of every thing and therefore I still think
and do maintain it to be a pity that it should be done by means of
a passion which bends down the faculties and turns all the wisdom
contemplations and operations of the soul backwardsa passion my
dear continued my father addressing himself to my mother which
couples and equals wise men with fools and makes us come out of our
caverns and hidingplaces more like satyrs and fourfooted beasts than
men

I know it will be said continued my father availing himself of the
Prolepsis that in itself and simply takenlike hunger or thirst
or sleeptis an affair neither good or bador shameful or
otherwiseWhy then did the delicacy of Diogenes and Plato so
recalcitrate against it and wherefore when we go about to make and
plant a man do we put out the candle and for what reason is it
that all the parts thereofthe congredientsthe preparationsthe
instruments and whatever serves thereto are so held as to be conveyed
to a cleanly mind by no language translation or periphrasis whatever

The act of killing and destroying a man continued my father raising
his voiceand turning to my uncle Tobyyou see is gloriousand the
weapons by which we do it are honourableWe march with them upon our
shouldersWe strut with them by our sidesWe gild themWe carve
themWe inlay themWe enrich themNay if it be but a scoundrel
cannon we cast an ornament upon the breach of it

My uncle Toby laid down his pipe to intercede for a better
epithetand Yorick was rising up to batter the whole hypothesis to
pieces

When Obadiah broke into the middle of the room with a complaint which
cried out for an immediate hearing

The case was this

My father whether by ancient custom of the manor or as impropriator
of the great tythes was obliged to keep a Bull for the service of the
Parish and Obadiah had led his cow upon a popvisit to him one day or
other the preceding summerI say one day or otherbecause as chance
would have it it was the day on which he was married to my fathers
housemaidso one was a reckoning to the other Therefore when
Obadiahs wife was brought to bedObadiah thanked God

Now said Obadiah I shall have a calf so Obadiah went daily to visit
his cow

Shell calve on Mondayon Tuesdayon Wednesday at the farthest

The cow did not calvenoshell not calve till next weekthe cow put
it off terriblytill at the end of the sixth week Obadiahs suspicions
like a good mans fell upon the Bull

Now the parish being very large my fathers Bull to speak the truth of
him was no way equal to the department he had however got himself
somehow or other thrust into employmentand as he went through the
business with a grave face my father had a high opinion of him

Most of the townsmen an please your worship quoth Obadiah believe
that tis all the Bulls fault

But may not a cow be barren replied my father turning to Doctor
Slop

It never happens said Dr Slop but the mans wife may have come
before her time naturally enoughPrithee has the child hair upon his
headadded Dr Slop

It is as hairy as I am said ObadiahObadiah had not been shaved for
three weeksWheuuucried my father beginning the sentence with
an exclamatory whistleand so brother Toby this poor Bull of mine
who is as good a Bull as ever pssd and might have done for Europa
herself in purer timeshad he but two legs less might have been driven
into Doctors Commons and lost his characterwhich to a Town Bull
brother Toby is the very same thing as his life

Ld said my mother what is all this story about

A Cock and a Bull said YorickAnd one of the best of its kind I ever
heard
