of none indicates a longform name does not exist In some
instances no shortform name existsthen the longform name must
serve for all usages

Gross domestic product GDP The value of all goods and
services produced domestically

Gross national product GNP The value of all goods and
services produced domestically plus income earned abroad minus
income earned by foreigners from domestic production

GNPGDP methodology GNPGDP dollar estimates for the OECD
countries the USSR Eastern Europe and a portion of the developing
countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP
calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange
rates The PPP methods involve the use of average price weights
which lie between the weights of the domestic and foreign price systems
using these weights US 100 converted into German marks by a PPP
method will buy an equal amount of goods and services in both the US
and Germany One caution the proportion of say military expenditures
as a percent of GNPGDP in local currency accounts may differ
substantially from the proportion when GNPGDP is expressed in PPP dollar
terms as for example when an observer estimates the dollar level of
Soviet or Japanese military expenditures Similarly dollar figures for
exports and imports reflect the price patterns of international
markets rather than PPP price patterns

Growth rate population The annual percent change in the
population resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over
deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country
The rate may be positive or negative

Maritime claims The proximity of neighboring states may prevent
some national claims from being fully extended

Merchant marine All ships engaged in the carriage of goods All
commercial vessels as opposed to all nonmilitary ships which
excludes tugs fishing vessels offshore oil rigs etc Also a
grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register

 Captive registerA register of ships maintained by a territory
possession or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships
owned in the parent country Also referred to as an offshore register
the offshore equivalent of an internal register Ships on a captive
register will fly the same flag as the parent country or a local
variant of it but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation
rules of the offshore territory Although the nature of a captive
register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent
country just as in the internal register the ships may also be owned
abroad The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register except that it is not the register of an independent state

 Flag of convenience registerA national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state The major
flags of convenience FOC attract ships to their register by virtue
of low fees low or nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal
manning requirements True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag
state Thus while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad It is also referred to as an
open register

 Flag stateThe nation in which a ship is registered and which
holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home
or abroad Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine
how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be
placed on the register

 Internal registerA register of ships maintained as a subset of
a national register Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits manning by
foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the flag state
when it functions as an FOC register The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most
notable examples of an internal register Both have been instrumental
in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in
attracting foreignowned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags

 Merchant shipA vessel that carries goods against payment of
freight Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately
restricted to commercial vessels only

 RegisterThe record of a ships ownership and nationality as
listed with the maritime authorities of a country Also the
compendium of such individual ships registrations Registration of
a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws
of the country in which registered the flag state regardless of the
nationality of the ships ultimate owner

Money figures All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars
unless otherwise indicated

Net migration rate The balance between the number of persons
entering and leaving a country during the year per 1000 persons
based on midyear population An excess of persons entering the
country is referred to as net immigration 356 migrants1000
population an excess of persons leaving the country as net
emigration 926 migrants1000 population

Population Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census
based on statistics from population censuses vital registration
systems or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on
assumptions about future trends

Total fertility rate The average number of children that would
be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing
years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age

Years All year references are for the calendar year CY unless

 Economy
Overview Fundamentally Afghanistan is an extremely poor landlocked
country highly dependent on farming wheat especially and livestock
raising sheep and goats Economic considerations however have played
second fiddle to political and military upheavals including the nineyear
Soviet military occupation ended 15 February 1989 and the continuing
bloody civil war Over the past decade onethird of the population has
fled the country with Pakistan sheltering some 3 million refugees
and Iran perhaps 2 million Another 1 million have probably
moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan Large numbers
of bridges buildings and factories have been destroyed or
damaged by military action or sabotage Government claims
to the contrary gross domestic product almost certainly is
lower than 10 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital
and the disruption of trade and transport Official claims indicate
that agriculture grew by 07 and industry by 35 in 1988

 Economy
Overview As the poorest country in Europe Albanias development
lags behind even the least favored areas of the Yugoslav economy
The Stalinisttype economy operates on the principles of central
planning and state ownership of the means of production In recent years
Albania has implemented limited economic reforms to stimulate its lagging
economy although they do not go nearly so far as current reforms
in the USSR and Eastern Europe Attempts at selfreliance and a
policy of not borrowing from international
lenderssometimes overlooked in recent yearshave greatly hindered the
development of a broad economic infrastructure Albania however
possesses considerable mineral resources and is largely selfsufficient
in food Numerical estimates of Albanian economic activity are
subject to an especially wide margin of error because the government
is isolated and closemouthed

 Economy
Overview The exploitation of oil and natural gas products forms the
backbone of the economy Algeria depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its
export receipts about 30 of government revenues and nearly 25
of GDP In 197374 the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming economy
that helped to finance an ambitious program of industrialization Plunging oil
and gas prices combined with the mismanagement of Algerias highly centralized
economy have brought the nation to its most serious social and economic crisis
since independence The government has promised farreaching reforms including
giving public sector companies more autonomy encouraging privatesector
activity boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports and a major overhaul
of the banking and financial systems In 1988 the government started to
implement a new economic policy to dismantle large state farms into
privately operated units

 Economy
Overview The mainstay of Andorras economy is tourism An estimated
12 million tourists visit annually attracted by Andorras dutyfree
status and by its summer and winter resorts Agricultural production is limited
by a scarcity of arable land and most food has to be imported The
principal livestock activity is sheep raising Manufacturing consists mainly of
cigarettes cigars and furniture The rapid pace of European economic
integration is a potential threat to Andorras advantages from its
dutyfree status

dollar which helped to improve the terms of trade Real GDP grew
by an average of 35 in 198689 up from 15 in 1985 However a

 Economy
Overview The Bolivian economy steadily deteriorated between
1980 and 1985 as La Paz financed growing budget deficits by expanding
the money supply and inflation spiraledpeaking at 11700 An austere
orthodox economic program adopted by newly elected President Paz
Estenssoro in 1985 however succeeded in reducing inflation to between
10 and 20 annually during 1987 and 1989 eventually restarting
economic growth President Paz Zamora has pledged to retain the economic
policies of the previous government in order to keep inflation down
and continue the growth begun under his predecessor Nevertheless
Bolivia continues to be one of the poorest countries in Latin
America and it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations for
its limited exportsmainly minerals and natural gas Moreover
for many farmers who constitute half of the countrys
work force the main cash crop is coca which is sold for cocaine
processing

 Economy
Overview The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and
crops Agriculture today provides a livelihood for over 80 of the
population but produces only about 50 of food needs and contributes
a small 5 to GDP The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of
the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry This sector mostly on the
strength of diamonds has gone from generating 25 of GDP in 1980 to over 50
in 1988 No other sector has experienced such growth especially not
that of the agricultural sector which is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor
soils The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25 A scarce resource base
limits diversification into laborintensive industries

 Economy
Overview The economy a mixture of private enterprises of all
sizes and extensive government intervention experienced enormous
difficulties in the late 1980s notably declining real growth runaway
inflation foreign debt obligations of more than 100 billion and
uncertain economic policy Government intervention includes trade and
investment restrictions wageprice controls interest and exchange rate
controls and extensive tariff barriers Ownership of major industrial
facilities is divided among private interests the government and
multinational companies Ownership in agriculture likewise is varied
with the government intervening in the politically sensitive
issues involving large landowners and the masses of poor peasants
In consultation with the IMF the Brazilian Government has initiated
several programs over the last few years to ameliorate the stagnation
and foreign debt problems None of these has given more than temporary
relief The strategy of the new Collor government is to increase
the pace of privatization encourage foreign trade and investment
and establish a more realistic exchange rate One longrun strength
is the existence of vast natural resources

 Economy
Overview Growth in the sluggish Bulgarian economy fell to the
2 annual level in the 1980s and by 1989 Sofias foreign debt had
skyrocketed to 10 billiongiving a debt service ratio of more
than 40 of hard currency earnings The postZhivkov regime
faces major problems of renovating an aging industrial plant
keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments
investing in additional energy capacity the portion of electric
power from nuclear energy reached 37 in 1988 and motivating workers
in part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises
A major decree of January 1989 summarized and extended
the governments economic restructuring efforts which include a partial
decentralization of controls over production decisions and foreign trade
The new regime promises more extensive reforms and eventually a market
economy But the ruling group cannot so far bring itself to give
up ultimate control over economic affairs exercised through the vertical
Partyministerial command structure Reforms have not
led to improved economic performance in particular the provision of more
and better consumer goods A further blow to the economy was the exodus
of 310000 ethnic Turks in mid1989 which caused temporary shortages
of skilled labor in glassware aluminum and other industrial plants
and in tobacco fields

 Economy
Overview Burma is one of the poorest countries in Asia with a per
capita GDP of about 280 The government reports negligible growth
for FY88 The nation has been unable to achieve any significant
improvement in export earnings because of falling prices for many
of its major commodity exports For rice traditionally the most important
export the drop in world prices has been accompanied by shrinking markets
and a smaller volume of sales In 1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export
and continues to hold this position The economy is heavily dependent on the
agricultural sector which generates about 40 of GDP and provides employment
for more than 65 of the work force

 Economy
Overview A landlocked resourcepoor country in an early stage
of economic development Burundi is predominately agricultural with only
a few basic industries Its economic health is dependent on the coffee crop
which accounts for an average 90 of foreign exchange earnings each year
The ability to pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the
vagaries of the climate and the international coffee market

 Economy
Overview Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic
development has been stymied by deadly political infighting The
economy is based on agriculture and related industries Over the
past decade Cambodia has been slowly recovering from its near destruction
by war and political upheaval It still remains however one of the
worlds poorest countries with an estimated per capita GDP of about
130 The food situation is precarious during the 1980s famine has
been averted only through international relief In 1986 the production level
of rice the staple food crop was able to meet only 80 of domestic needs The
biggest success of the nations recovery program has been in new rubber
plantings and in fishing Industry other than rice processing is
almost nonexistent Foreign trade is primarily with the USSR and Vietnam

 Economy
Overview Over the past decade the economy has registered a remarkable
performance because of the development of an offshore oil industry Real
GDP growth annually averaged 10 from 1978 to 1985 In 1986 Cameroon had one of
the highest levels of income per capita in tropical Africa with oil revenues
picking up the slack as growth in other sectors softened Because of the sharp
drop in oil prices however the economy is now experiencing serious budgetary
difficulties and balanceofpayments disequalibrium Oil reserves currently
being exploited will be depleted in the early 1990s so ways must be found to
boost agricultural and industrial exports in the medium term The Sixth
Cameroon Development Plan 198691 stresses balanced development and designates
agriculture as the basis of the countrys economic future

 Economy
Overview As an affluent hightech industrial society Canada
today closely resembles the US in per capita output marketoriented
economic system and pattern of production Since World War II the
impressive growth of the manufacturing mining and service sectors has
transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily
industrial and urban In the 1980s Canada registered one of the highest
rates of growth among the OECD nations averaging about 4 With its
great natural resources skilled labor force and modern capital plant
Canada has excellent economic prospects In mid1990 however the
longsimmering problems between English and Frenchspeaking areas
became so acute that observers spoke openly of a possible split in the
confederation foreign investors were becoming edgy

cash crop accounting for 43 of exports Over 80 of the work force
is employed in subsistence farming and fishing Industry is based almost
entirely on the processing of agricultural products including cotton
sugarcane and cattle Chad is still highly dependent on foreign aid with its
economy in trouble and many regions suffering from shortages

 Economy
Overview Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been
trying to move the economy from the sluggish Sovietstyle centrally planned
economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market elementsbut
still within the framework of monolithic Communist control To this
end the authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility
in agriculture in place of the old collectivization increased the authority
of local officials and plant managers in industry permitted a wide
variety of smallscale enterprise in services and light manufacturing
and opened the foreign economic sector to increased trade and joint
ventures The most gratifying result has been a strong spurt in production
particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s Otherwise the leadership has
often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism
bureaucracy lassitude corruption and of capitalism windfall gains
and steppedup inflation Beijing thus has periodically backtracked
retightening central controls at intervals and thereby undermining the
credibility of the reform process Open inflation and excess demand continue to
plague the economy and political repression following the crackdown at
Tiananmen in mid1989 has curtailed tourism foreign aid and new investment
by foreign firms Popular resistance and changes in central policy have weakened
Chinas population control program which is essential to the nations longterm
economic viability

years has helped to offset the decline in coffee pricesColombias major
export The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the summer

dampen prospects for future growth

economy It contributes about 40 to GDP employs 80 of the labor
force and provides most of the exports The country is not selfsufficient in
food production and rice the main staple accounts for 90 of imports
During the period 198286 the industrial sector grew at an annual average rate
of 53 but its contribution to GDP was less than 4 in 1986 Despite major
investment in the tourist industry which accounts for about 25 of GDP growth

 Economy
Overview Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
economy providing about twothirds of government revenues and
exports In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo
to finance largescale development projects with growth averaging 5
annually one of the highest rates in Africa The world decline in
oil prices however has forced the government to launch an austerity
program to cope with declining receipts and mounting foreign debts

 Economy
Overview Agriculture provides the economic base The major export
earners are fruit copra and clothing Manufacturing activities are limited to
a fruitprocessing plant and several clothing factories Economic development
is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack of
natural resources and good transportation links A large trade deficit is
annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid Current
economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential and
expanding the fishing industry

 Economy
Overview In 1988 the economy grew at a 38 rate a drop from the

on the strength of good coffee and banana crops and in construction

 Economy
Overview The Sovietstyle economy centrally planned and largely
state owned is highly dependent on the agricultural sector and foreign
trade Sugar provides about 75 of export revenues and is mostly exported
to the USSR and other CEMA countries The economy has stagnated since
1985 under a program that has deemphasized material incentives in the
workplace abolished farmers informal produce markets and raised prices
of governmentsupplied goods and services Castro has complained that
the ongoing CEMA reform process has interfered with the regular flow of
goods to Cuba Recently the government has been trying to increase
trade with Latin America and China Cuba has had difficulty servicing
its foreign debt since 1982 The government currently is encouraging
foreign investment in tourist facilities Other investment priorities
include sugar basic foods and nickel The annual 4 billion Soviet
subsidy a main prop to Cubas threadbare economy may be cut in view
of the USSRs mounting economic problems

 Economy
Overview Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all
the Third World economies most industrial plants being owned by the
government Overregulation holds back technical modernization and
foreign investment Even so the economy grew rapidly during the late
1970s and early 1980s but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices
and an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin
negotiations with the IMF for balanceofpayments support As part of
the 1987 agreement with the IMF the government agreed to institute
a reform program to reduce inflation promote economic growth and
improve its external position The reforms have been slow in coming
however and the economy has been largely stagnant for the past
three years With 1 million people being added every eight months

the 5 of the total land area available for agriculture

 Economy
Overview The economy experienced a modest recovery during the period
198386 after a sharp decline in the early 1980s Real GDP grew by 15 a
year on the strength of value added by the manufacturing and service sectors
In 1987 the economy expanded by 25 as agricultural output recovered from the
1986 drought The agricultural sector accounts for 25 of GDP employs about 40
of the labor force and contributes about 66 to total exports Coffee is the
major commercial crop contributing 60 to export earnings The manufacturing
sector based largely on food and beverage processing accounts for 17 of GDP
and 16 of employment Economic losses due to guerrilla sabotage total more
than 20 billion since 1979 The costs of maintaining a large military
seriously constrain the governments ability to provide essential social
services

 Economy
Overview The economy is based on sheep farming which directly or
indirectly employs most of the work force A few dairy herds are kept to meet
domestic consumption of milk and milk products and crops grown are primarily
those for providing winter fodder Major sources of income are from the export
of highgrade wool to the UK and the sale of stamps and coins Rich stocks of
fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders but
development plans called for the islands to have six trawlers by 1989
In 1987 the government began to sell fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone These license
fees amount to more than 25 million per year To encourage tourism the
Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for
visitors who are attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing

 Economy
Overview Fijis economy is primarily agricultural with a large
subsistence sector Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange
and sugar processing accounts for onethird of industrial output
Industry including sugar milling contributes 10 to GDP Fiji
traditionally earned considerable sums of hard currency from the 250000
tourists who visited each year In 1987 however after two military
coups the economy went into decline GDP dropped by 78 in
1987 and by another 25 in 1988 political uncertainly created a drop in
tourism and the worst drought of the century caused sugar production
to fall sharply In contrast sugar and tourism turned in strong
performances in 1989 and the economy rebounded vigorously

 Economy
Overview Finland has a highly industrialized largely free market
economy with per capita output nearly threefourths the US figure
Its main economic force is the manufacturing sectorprincipally
the wood metals and engineering industries Trade is important with the
export of goods representing about 25 of GNP Except for timber and
several minerals Finland depends on imported raw materials energy and
some components of manufactured goods Because of the climate agricultural
development is limited to maintaining selfsufficiency in basic commodities
Economic prospects are generally bright the main shadow being the
increasing pressures on wages and prices

 Economy
Overview One of the worlds most developed economies France
has substantial agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern
industrial sector Large tracts of fertile land the application of modern
technology and subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural
producer in Western Europe France is largely selfsufficient in agricultural
products and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products The industrial
sector generates about onethird of GDP and employs about onethird of the work
force During the period 198286 economic growth was sluggish averaging
only 14 annually This trend was reversed by late 1987 however
with a strong expansion of consumer demand followed by a surge in
investment The economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new
entrants into the labor force resulting in a high unemployment rate
but the upward trend in growth recently pushed the jobless rate below 10
The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
sectors

 Economy
Overview The economy dependent on timber and manganese until the early
1970s is now dominated by the oil sector During the period 198185 oil
accounted for about 46 of GDP 83 of export earnings and 65 of government
revenues on average The high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a
substantial increase in per capita income stimulated domestic demand
reinforced migration from rural to urban areas and raised the level of real
wages to among the highest in SubSaharan Africa The threeyear slide of
Gabons economy which began with falling oil prices in 1985 stabilized
in 1989 because of a near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows

Country Gaza Strip
Note The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with
Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai and the Golan
Heights As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by President
Reagans 1 September 1982 peace initiative the final status of the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a peace
treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned
parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the
respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy
that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be
determined In the view of the US the term West Bank describes all of the area
west of the Jordan under Jordanian administration before the 1967 ArabIsraeli
war With respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement however
it is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest
of the West Bank because of the citys special status and circumstances
Therefore a negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be
different in character from that of the rest of the West Bank

 Economy
Overview The GDR is moving rapidly away from its centrally planned
economy As the 1990s begin economic integration with West Germany
appears inevitable beginning with the establishment of a common
currency The opening of the border with the FRG in late 1989 and the
continuing emigration of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers had
brought growth to a standstill by yearend 1989 Features of the old
economic regime that will quickly change a the collectivization
of 95 of East German farms b state ownership of nearly all
transportation facilities industrial plants foreign trade
organizations and financial institutions c the 65 share in trade
of the USSR and other CEMA countries and d the detailed control over
economic details exercised by Party and state Once integrated into
the thriving West German economy the area will have to stem the
outflow of workers and renovate the obsolescent industrial base After an
initial readjustment period living standards and quality of output will
steadily rise toward West German levels

 Economy
Overview West Germany a major economic power and a leading exporter
has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys excellent
living standards and comprehensive social welfare benefits The FRG is
poor in natural resources coal being the most important
mineral The FRGs comparative advantage lies in the technologically
advanced production stages Thus manufacturing and services dominate
economic activity and raw materials and semimanufactures constitute
a large proportion of imports In 1988 manufacturing accounted for
35 of GDP with other sectors contributing lesser amounts The major
economic problem in 1989 is persistent unemployment of over 8 The FRG is well
poised to take advantage of the increasing economic integration of the European
Community The dramatic opening of the boundary with East Germany in late 1989
poses new economic challenges that could tax even this powerful economy

 Economy
Overview Supported by substantial international assistance Ghana
has been implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983
Good harvests in 1988 featured the 6 growth in GNP Moves toward privatization
and relaxation of government controls continued in 198889 although at a
slowerthanexpected pace In 1988 service on the 28 billion debt was
equivalent to 75 of export earnings As Ghana obtains concessional loans
and pays off highinterest debt however debt service is expected to fall
below 30 of export earnings in the early 1990s The economic rebuilding
program has both helped and harmed the manufacturing sector for example
by improving the supply of raw materials and by increasing competition from
imports The longterm outlook is favorable provided that the political
structure can endure the slow pace at which living standards are improving
and can manage the problems stemming from excessive population growth

 Economy
Overview Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic
entrepreneurial system overlaid in 198189 by a
socialistleftgovernment that enlarged the public sector and became the
nations largest employer Like many other Western economies Greece
suffered severely from the global oil price hikes of the 1970s annual
GDP growth plunging from 8 to 2 in the 1980s and inflation
unemployment and budget deficits rising sharply The fall of the
socialist government in 1989 and the inability of the conservative
opposition to muster a clear majority have led to business uncertainty
and the continued prospects for lackluster economic performance
Once the political situation is sorted out Greece will have to face the
challenges posed by the steadily increasing integration of the European
Community including the progressive lowering of tariff barriers Tourism
continues as a major industry providing a vital offset to the sizable
commodity trade deficit

local consumption although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported
food which comes mainly from France Light industry consists mostly of
sugar and rum production Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported

 Economy
Overview After growing on average at less than 1 a year in 198487
GDP dropped by 3 in 1988 the result of bad weather labor trouble in the

Consumer prices rose about 35 and the current account deficit widened
substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell Moreover electric power
is in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in
national output The government in association with international financial
agencies seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds The
governments stabilization programaimed at establishing realistic
exchange rates reasonable price stability and a resumption of
growthrequires considerable public administrative abilities and
continued patience by consumers during a long incubation period

 Economy
Overview Hungarys postwar Communist government spurred the movement
from a predominantly agricultural to an industrialized economy The share
of the labor force in agriculture dropped from over 50 in 1950 to under
20 in 1989 Agriculture nevertheless remains an important sector
providing sizable export earnings and meeting domestic food needs
Industry accounts for about 40 of GNP and 30 of employment Nearly
threefourths of foreign trade is with the USSR and Eastern Europe Low
rates of growth reflect the inability of the Sovietstyle economy to
modernize capital plant and motivate workers GNP grew about 1 in 1988
and declined by 1 in 1989 Since 1985 external debt has
more than doubled to nearly 20 billion In recent years Hungary has
moved further than any other East European country in experimenting with
decentralized and marketoriented enterprises These experiments have
failed to jumpstart the economy because of limitations on funds for
privatization continued subsidization of insolvent state enterprises
and the leaderships reluctance to implement sweeping market reforms
that would cause additional social dislocations in the short term

 Economy
Overview Icelands prosperous Scandinaviantype economy is basically
capitalistic but with extensive welfare measures low unemployment and
comparatively even distribution of income The economy is heavily dependent on
the fishing industry which provides nearly 75 of export earnings In the
absence of other natural resources Icelands economy is vulnerable to changing
world fish prices National output declined for the second consecutive year in
1989 and two of the largest fish farms filed for bankruptcy Other economic
activities include livestock raising and aluminum smelting A fall in the fish
catch is expected for 1990 resulting in a continuation of the recession

 Economy
Overview Indias Malthusian economy is a mixture of traditional
village farming and handicrafts modern agriculture old and new branches
of industry and a multitude of support services It presents both the
entrepreneurial skills and drives of the capitalist system and
widespread government intervention of the socialist mold Growth of 4
to 5 annually in the 1980s has softened the impact of population growth
on unemployment social tranquility and the environment Agricultural output
has continued to expand reflecting the greater use of modern farming techniques
and improved seed that have helped to make India selfsufficient in food grains
and a net agricultural exporter However tens of millions of villagers
particularly in the south have not benefited from the green
revolution and live in abject poverty Industry has benefited from a
liberalization of controls The growth rate of the service sector has
also been strong

 Economy
Overview Since the 1979 revolution the banks petroleum industry
transportation utilities and mining have been nationalized but the
new fiveyear planthe first since the revolutionpassed in January
1990 calls for the transfer of many governmentcontrolled enterprises
to the private sector Warrelated disruptions massive corruption
mismanagement demographic pressures and ideological rigidities have kept
economic growth at depressed levels Oil accounts for 90 of export
revenues A combination of war damage and low oil prices brought a 2
drop in GNP in 1988 GNP probably rose slightly in 1989 considerably
short of the 34 population growth rate in 1989 Heating oil and gasoline
are rationed Agriculture has suffered from the war land reform and shortages
of equipment and materials The fiveyear plan seeks to reinvigorate the
economy by increasing the role of the private sector boosting nonoil
income and securing foreign loans The plan is overly ambitious but
probably will generate some shortterm relief

 Economy
Overview The Bathist regime engages in extensive central planning
and management of industrial production and foreign trade while leaving
some smallscale industry and services and most agriculture to
private enterprise The economy is dominated by the oil sector which provides
about 95 of foreign exchange earnings Since the early 1980s financial
problems caused by war expenditures and damage to oil export facilities by
Iran have led the government to implement austerity measures and to reschedule
foreign debt payments Oil exports have gradually increased with the
construction of new pipelines Agricultural development remains hampered by
labor shortages salinization and dislocations caused by previous land reform
and collectivization programs The industrial sector although accorded high
priority by the government is under financial constraints New investment funds
are generally allocated only to projects that result in import substitution or
foreign exchange earnings

 Economy
Overview The economy is small open and trade dependent Agriculture
once the most important sector is now dwarfed by industry which accounts for
35 of GNP and about 80 of exports and employs 20 of the labor force The
government has successfully reduced the rate of inflation from doubledigit
figures in the late 1970s to about 4 in 1989 In 1987 after years of deficits
the balance of payments was brought into the black Unemployment however
is a serious problem A 1989 unemployment rate of 177 placed Ireland
along with Spain as the countries with the worst jobless records in

 Economy
Overview Israel has a market economy with substantial government
participation It depends on imports for crude oil food grains raw materials
and military equipment Despite limited natural resources Israel has developed
its agriculture and industry sectors on an intensive scale over the past 20
years Industry accounts for about 23 of the labor force agriculture for 6
and services for most of the balance Diamonds hightechnology
machinery and agricultural products fruits and vegetables are the
biggest export earners The balance of payments has traditionally
been negative but is offset by large transfer payments and foreign loans
Nearly twothirds of Israels 16 billion external debt is owed to
the US which is its major source for economic and military aid
To earn needed foreign exchange Israel must continue to exploit
hightechnology niches in the international market such as medical
scanning equipment In 1987 the economy showed a 52 growth in real GNP the
best gain in nearly a decade in 198889 the gain was only 1 annually

 Economy
Overview Since World War II the economy has changed from one based on
agriculture into a ranking industrial economy with approximately the same total
and per capita output as France and the UK The country is still divided into a
developed industrial north dominated by large private companies and state
enterprises and an undeveloped agricultural south Services account for 58 of
GDP industry 37 and agriculture 5 Most raw materials needed by industry and
over 75 of energy requirements must be imported The economic recovery that
began in mid1983 has continued through 1989 with the economy growing at an
annual average rate of 3 For the 1990s Italy faces the problems of
refurbishing a tottering communications system curbing the increasing
pollution in major industrial centers and adjusting to the new
competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic integration of the
European Community

 Economy
Overview The Ivory Coast is among the worlds largest producers and
exporters of coffee cocoa beans and palmkernel oil Consequently the economy
is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and cocoa
and to weather conditions Despite attempts by the government to diversify the
economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related industries The
agricultural sector accounts for over onethird of GDP and about 80 of export
earnings and employs about 85 of the labor force A collapse of world cocoa and
coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a recession from which the country
had not recovered by 1989

 Economy
Overview The economy is based on sugar bauxite and tourism
In 1985 it suffered a setback with the closure of some facilities in the
bauxite and alumina industry a major source of hard currency earnings Since
1986 an economic recovery has been under way In 1987 conditions began to
improve for the bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal
prices The recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and
tourism sectors In September 1988 Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe
damage on crops and the electric power system a sharp but temporary
setback to the economy By October 1989 the economic recovery from the
hurricane was largely complete and real growth was up about 3 for 1989

 Economy
Overview Although Japan has few natural resources since 1971 it has
become the worlds thirdlargest industrial economy ranking behind only the US
and the USSR Governmentindustry cooperation a strong work ethic and a
comparatively small defense allocation have helped Japan advance rapidly
notably in hightechnology fields Industry the most important sector of the
economy is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels
Selfsufficent in rice Japan must import 50 of its requirements for other
grain and fodder crops Japan maintains one of the worlds largest fishing
fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the total global catch Overall
economic growth has been spectacular a 10 average in the 1960s a 5
average in the 1970s and 1980s In 1989 strong investment and
consumption spending helped maintain growth at nearly 5 Inflation
remains low at 21 despite high oil prices and a somewhat weaker yen
Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus 60 billion in 1989 which
supports extensive investment in foreign properties

 Economy
Overview Jordan was a secondary beneficiary of the oil boom of
the late 1970s and early 1980s when its GNP growth averaged 1012 Recent
years however have witnessed a sharp reduction in cash aid from Arab
oilproducing countries and in worker remittances with growth averaging
12 Importsmainly oil capital goods consumer durables and
foodstuffshave been outstripping exports by roughly 2 billion annually
the difference being made up by aid remittances and borrowing In 1989
the government pursued policies to encourage private investment curb
imports of luxury goods promote exports reduce the budget deficit and in
general reinvigorate economic growth Success will depend largely on
exogenous forces such as the absence of drought and a pickup in outside
support Down the road the completion of the proposed Unity Dam on the
Yarmuk is vital to meet rapidly growing requirements for water

 Economy
Overview The country has few national resources Phosphate deposits were
exhausted at the time of independence in 1979 Copra and fish now represent
the bulk of production and exports The economy has fluctuated widely in
recent years Real GDP declined about 8 in 1987 as the fish catch fell
sharply to only onefourth the level of 1986 and copra production was hampered
by repeated rains Output rebounded strongly in 1988 with real GDP growing
by 17 The upturn in economic growth came from an increase in copra production
and a good fish catch Following the strong surge in output in 1988 GDP
remained about the same in 1989

 Economy
Overview More than 90 of this command economy is socialized
agricultural land is collectivized and stateowned industry produces 95 of
manufactured goods State control of economic affairs is unusually tight
even for a Communist country because of the small size and homogeneity of
the society and the strict oneman rule of Kim Economic growth during
the period 198489 has averaged approximately 3 Abundant natural resources
and hydropower form the basis of industrial development Output of the
extractive industries includes coal iron ore magnesite graphite copper
zinc lead and precious metals Manufacturing emphasis is centered on heavy
industry with light industry lagging far behind The use of highyielding
seed varieties expansion of irrigation and the heavy use of fertilizers
have enabled North Korea to become largely selfsufficient in food production
North Korea however is far behind South Korea in economic development and
living standards

 Economy
Overview The oil sector dominates the economy Of the countries in the

Earnings from hydrocarbons generate over 90 of both export and government
revenues and contribute about 40 to GDP Most of the nonoil sector is dependent
upon oilderived government revenues to provide infrastructure development and
to promote limited industrial diversification The economy is heavily dependent
upon foreign laborKuwaitis account for less than 20 of the labor force The

 Government
Note Between early 1975 and late 1976 Lebanon was torn by civil
war between its Christiansthen aided by Syrian troopsand its Muslims
and their Palestinian allies The ceasefire established in October
1976 between the domestic political groups generally held for about six
years despite occasional fighting Syrian troops constituted as the Arab
Deterrent Force by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon Syrias
move toward supporting the Lebanese Muslims and the Palestinians and
Israels growing support for Lebanese Christians brought the two sides
into rough equilibrium but no progress was made toward national
reconciliation or political reformsthe original cause of the war

 Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian presence in
Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 Israeli
forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and mounted a
summerlong siege of Beirut which resulted in the evacuation of the
PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational
force MNF made up of US French and Italian troops

 Within days of the departure of the MNF Lebanons newly elected
president Bashir Gemayel was assassinated In the wake of his death
Christian militiamen massacred hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two
Beirut camps This prompted the return of the MNF to ease the security
burden on Lebanons weak Army and security forces In late March 1984
the last MNF units withdrew

 Lebanese Parliamentarians met in Taif Saudi Arabia in late 1989 and
concluded a national reconciliation pact that codified a new powersharing
formula specifiying a Christian president but giving Muslims more
authority Rene Muawad was subsequently elected president on 4 November
1989 ending a 13month period during which Lebanon had no president and
rival Muslim and Christian governments Muawad was assassinated
17 days later on 22 November on 24 November Elias Harawi was
elected to succeed Muawad

 Progress toward lasting political compromise in Lebanon has been
stalled by opposition from Christian strongman Gen Michel Awn
Awnappointed acting Prime Minister by outgoing president Amin Gemayel
in September 1988called the national reconciliation accord
illegitimate and has refused to recognize the new Lebanese Government

 Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops Syria
augmented its troop presence during the weeks following Muawads
assassination Troops are deployed in West Beirut and its southern
suburbs in Al Biqa and in northern Lebanon Iran also maintains
a small contingent of revolutionary guards in Al Biqa from
which it supports Lebanese Islamic fundamentalist groups

 Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985
although it still retains troops in a 10kmdeep security zone north
of its border with Lebanon Israel arms and trains the Army of South
Lebanon ASL which also occupies the security zone and is Israels
first line of defense against attacks on its northern border

 Economy
Overview Severe factional infighting in 1989 has been destroying physical
property interrupting the established pattern of economic affairs and
practically ending chances of restoring Lebanons position as a Middle
Eastern entrepot and banking hub The ordinary Lebanese citizen
struggles to keep afloat in an environment of physical danger high
unemployment and growing shortages The central governments ability
to collect taxes has suffered greatly from militia control and taxation
of local areas As the civil strife persists the US dollar has become
more and more the medium of exchange Transportation
communications and other parts of the infrastructure continue to deteriorate
Family remittances foreign political money going to the factions international
emergency aid and a small volume of manufactured exports help prop up the
battered economy Prospects for 1990 are grim with expected further declines in
economic activity and living standards

 Economy
Overview The socialistoriented economy depends primarily upon revenues
from the oil sector which contributes virtually all export earnings and over
50 to GNP Since 1980 however the sharp drop in oil prices and resulting
decline in export revenues has adversely affected economic development In 1986
per capita GNP was the highest in Africa at 5410 but it had been 2000
higher in 1982 Severe cutbacks in imports over the past five years have
led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs although the reopening
of the LibyanTunisian border in April 1988 and the LibyanEgyptian
border in December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages Austerity
budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the governments
ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure development
projects The nonoil industrial and construction sectors which
account for about 15 of GNP have expanded from processing
mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals iron steel
and aluminum Although agriculture accounts for less than 5 of GNP it employs
20 of the labor force Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm
output requiring Libya to import about 75 of its food requirements

that have restricted imports of equipment and spare parts and put strict
controls on foreignowned enterprises In 1986 the government introduced a
fiveyear development plan that stresses selfsufficiency in food mainly rice
by 1990 increased production for exports and reduced energy imports

 Economy
Overview A landlocked country Malawi ranks among the worlds least
developed with a per capita GDP of 180 The economy is predominately
agricultural and operates under a relatively free enterprise
environment with about 90 of the population living in rural areas
Agriculture accounts for 40 of GDP and 90 of export revenues After
two years of weak performance economic growth improved significantly
in 1988 as a result of good weather and a broadly based economic
adjustment effort by the government The closure of traditional trade
routes through Mozambique continues to be a constraint on the economy

 Economy
Overview In 198889 booming exports helped Malaysia continue to recover
from the severe 198586 recession Real output grew by 87 in 1988 and
about 77 in 1989 helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing output and
further increases in foreign direct investment particularly from
Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home Malaysia has
become the worlds thirdlargest producer of semiconductor devices
after the US and Japan and the worlds largest exporter of semiconductor
devices Inflation remained low as unemployment stood at about 8 of
the labor force and as the government followed prudent fiscalmonetary
policies The country is not selfsufficient in food and a majority
of the rural population subsists at the poverty level Malaysias
high export dependence merchandise exports are 63 of GDP leaves
it vulnerable to a recession in the OECD countries or a fall in

 Economy
Overview The economy is based on sugarcane bananas tourism and light
industry Agriculture accounts for about 7 of GDP and the small industrial
sector for 10 Sugar production has declined with most of the sugarcane now
used for the production of rum Banana exports are increasing however going
mostly to France The bulk of meat vegetable and grain requirements must be
imported contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
transfers of aid from France Tourism has become more important than
agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange The majority of the work
force is employed in the service sector and in administration In 1984 the
annual per capita income was relatively high at 3650 During 1985 the
unemployment rate was between 25 and 30 and was particularly severe among
younger workers

 Economy
Overview A majority of the population still depends on agriculture
and livestock for a livelihood even though most of the nomads and many
subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent drought in 1983
Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore that account for almost 50 of
total exports The decline in world demand for this ore however has led to
cutbacks in production in recent years The nations coastal waters are among
the richest fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners
threatens this key source of revenue The countrys first deepwater

 Economy
Overview One of Africas poorest countries with a per capita GDP of
little more than 100 Mozambique has failed to exploit the economic potential
of its sizable agricultural hydropower and transportation resources
Indeed national output consumption and investment declined throughout the
first half of the 1980s because of internal disorders lack of government
administrative control and a growing foreign debt A sharp increase in foreign
aid attracted by an economic reform policy has resulted in successive years of
economic growth since 1985 Agricultural output nevertheless is only
at about 75 of its 1981 level and grain has to be imported Industry
operates at only 2040 of capacity The economy depends heavily on
foreign assistance to keep afloat

 Economy
Overview Revenues come from the export of phosphates the reserves
of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000 Phosphates have given
Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third
World10000 annually Few other resources exist so
most necessities must be imported including fresh water from
Australia The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income
from phosphates constitute serious longterm problems Substantial
investment in trust funds out of phosphate income will help cushion the
transition

limited and what there is involves the processing of agricultural
produce jute sugarcane tobacco and grain
Apart from agricultural land and forests the only other exploitable natural
resources are mica hydropower and tourism Despite considerable investment in
the agricultural sector production in the 1980s has not kept pace with the
population growth of 27 which has led to a reduction in exportable surpluses

 Economy
Overview This highly developed and affluent economy is based on
private enterprise The government makes its presence felt however
through many regulations permit requirements and welfare programs
affecting most aspects of economic activity The trade and financial
services sector contributes over 50 of GDP Industrial activity
including construction provides about 25 of GDP and is led by the
foodprocessing oilrefining and metalworking industries The highly
mechanized agricultural sector employs only 6 of the
labor force but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic
foodprocessing industry An unemployment rate of over 86 and a sizable
budget deficit are currently the most serious economic problems

 Economy
Overview Tourism petroleum refining and offshore finance are the
mainstays of the economy The islands enjoy a comparatively high per
capita income and a welldeveloped infrastructure compared with other
countries in the region Unlike many Latin American countries the
Netherlands Antilles has avoided large international debt Almost all
consumer and capital goods are imported with the US being the major
supplier The economy has suffered somewhat in recent years because
of the depressed state of the world oil market and declining tax revenues
In 1983 the drop in oil prices led to the devaluation of the Venezuelan
bolivar which ended a substantial flow of Venezuelan tourists to the
islands As a result of a decline in tax revenues the government has
been seeking financial support from the Netherlands

agrarian economy dependent on a guaranteed British market to an open
free market economy that can compete on the global scene The government

inflationary pressures and permit the expansion of welfare benefits The
results have been mixed inflation is down from doubledigit levels
but growth has been sluggish and unemployment always a highly sensitive
issue has been at a record high 74 In 1988 GDP fell by 1 and in
1989 grew by a moderate 24

 Economy
Overview Government control of the economy historically has been
extensive although the new government has pledged to reduce it
The financial system is directly controlled by the state which also
regulates wholesale purchasing production sales foreign trade and
distribution of most goods Over 50 of the agricultural and industrial
firms are state owned Sandinista economic policies and the war have
produced a severe economic crisis The foundation of the economy
continues to be the export of agricultural commodities largely coffee
and cotton Farm production fell by roughly 7 in 1989 the fifth
successive year of decline The agricultural sector employs 44
of the work force and accounts for 23 of GDP and 86 of export earnings
Industry which employs 13 of the work force and contributes 26 to GDP
showed a sharp drop of  23 in 1988 and remains below pre1979 levels
External debt is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis
In 1989 the annual inflation rate was 1700 down from a record
16000 in 1988 Shortages of basic consumer goods are widespread

 Economy

Overview About 90 of the population is engaged in farming and
stock rearing activities which generate almost half of the national income
The economy also depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits
Uranium production grew rapidly in the mid1970s but tapered off in the
early 1980s when world prices declined France is a major customer
while FRG Japan and Spain also make regular purchases The depressed
demand for uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the
economy a severe trade imbalance and a mounting external debt

 Economy
Overview In 1989 despite rising oil prices the economic
performance failed to meet government expectations because of higher
inflationary pressures fueled by a relatively poor agricultural
performance Agricultural production was up only 4 following a 10
decline in 1988 and manufacturing remained below the 1985 level
with only a 6 increase The government is continuing an economic
adjustment program to reduce Nigerias dependence on oil and to help
create a basis for sustainable noninflationary growth

slowdown in consumer spending but picked up again in 1989 Future
economic issues involve the aging of the population the increased

Ocean covers about onethird of the global surface larger than the total
land area of the world

Coastline 135663 km

Climate the western Pacific is monsoonala rainy season occurs during
the summer months when moistureladen winds blow from the ocean over the
land and a dry season during the winter months when dry winds blow from
the Asian land mass back to the ocean

Terrain surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise warm
water gyre broad circular system of currents and in the southern Pacific by
a counterclockwise cool water gyre sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and
Sea of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from
Antarctica in October the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by
the East Pacific Rise while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches

October tropical cyclones hurricanes may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October most common in August and
September southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica
occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade
winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south which
kills the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies
consequently the anchovies move to better feeding grounds causing resident
marine birds to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source

Note the major choke points are the Bering Strait Panama Canal
Luzon Strait and the Singapore Strait the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean
into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean ships subject to
superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme south
from May to October persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June to
December is a hazard to shipping surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic
and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire

 Economy
Overview The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world
economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch
It provides cheap sea transportation between East and West extensive fishing
grounds offshore oil and gas fields minerals and sand and gravel for the
construction industry In 1985 over half 54 of the worlds total fish catch
came from the Pacific Ocean which is the only ocean where the fish catch
has increased every year since 1978 Exploitation of offshore oil and gas
reserves is playing an ever increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia
New Zealand China US and Peru The high cost of recovering offshore oil
and gas combined with the lower world prices for oil since 1985 has slowed
but not stopped new drillings

 Economy
Overview Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual
problems of rapidly increasing population sizable government deficits
and heavy dependence on foreign aid In addition the economy must support a
large military establishment and provide for the needs of 4 million Afghan
refugees A real economic growth rate averaging 56 in recent years has enabled
the country to cope with these problems Almost all agriculture and smallscale
industry is in private hands and the government seeks to privatize a portion
of the largescale industrial enterprises now publicly owned In
December 1988 Pakistan signed a threeyear economic reform agreement
with the IMF which provides for a reduction in the government deficit
and a liberalization of trade in return for further IMF financial
support The socalled Islamization of the economy has affected mainly the
financial sector for example a prohibition on certain types of interest
payments Pakistan almost certainly will make little headway against its
population problem at the current rate of growth population would
double in 32 years

 Economy
Overview The economy is predominantly agricultural Agriculture
including forestry accounts for about 25 of GNP employs about 45 of
the labor force and provides the bulk of exports Paraguay has no known
significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
hydropower potential Since 1981 economic performance has declined
compared with the boom period of 197681 when real GDP grew at an
average annual rate of nearly 11 During 198286 real GDP fell three
out of five years inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32 and
foreign debt rose Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the
economy were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam bad weather
for crops and weak international commodity prices for agricultural exports
In 1987 the economy experienced a modest recovery because of improved weather
conditions and stronger international prices for key agricultural exports The
recovery continued through 1988 with a bumper soybean crop and record cotton
production The government however must follow through on promises of reforms
needed to deal with large fiscal deficits growing debt arrearages
and falling reserves

Overview The economy is verging on hyperinflation and economic activity
is contracting rapidly Deficit spending is at the root of domestic economic
problems but poor relations with international lendersthe result of
curtailing debt payments since 1985are preventing an inflow of funds to
generate a recovery Reduced standards of living have increased labor tensions
and strikes particularly in the key mining sector have cut production and
exports Foreign exchange shortages have forced reductions in vital consumer
imports such as food and industrial inputs Peru is the worlds leading producer
of coca from which the drug cocaine is produced

 Economy
Overview The economy except for the agricultural sector had
followed the Soviet model of state ownership and control of the countrys
productive assets About 75 of agricultural production had come from the
private sector and the rest from state farms The economy has presented a
picture of moderate but slowing growth against a background of underlying
weaknesses in technology and worker motivation GNP increased between 3
and 6 annually during the period 19831986 but grew only 25 and 21
in 1987 and 1988 respectively Output dropped by 15 in 1989 The
inflation rate after falling sharply from the 1982 peak of 100 to 22
in 1986 rose to a galloping rate of 640 in 1989 Shortages of consumer
goods and some food items worsened in 198889 Agricultural products and
coal have remained the biggest hard currency earners but manufactures
are increasing in importance Poland with its hard currency debt of
approximately 40 billion is severely limited in its ability to import
muchneeded hard currency goods The sweeping political changes of 1989
disrupted normal economic channels and exacerbated shortages In January
1990 the new Solidarityled government adopted a cold turkey program for
transforming Poland to a market economy The government moved to
eliminate subsidies end artificially low prices make the zloty
convertible and in general halt the hyperinflation These financial
measures are accompanied by plans to privatize the economy in stages
Substantial outside aid will be needed if Poland is to make a successful
transition in the 1990s

 Economy
Overview Industry which accounts for onethird of the labor force
and generates over half the GNP suffers from an aging capital plant and
persistent shortages of energy In recent years the agricultural sector
has had to contend with drought mismanagement and shortages of inputs
Favorable weather in 1989 helped produce a good harvest although far
below government claims The new government is slowly loosening the tight
central controls of Ceausescus command economy It has instituted
moderate land reforms with close to onethird of cropland now in
private hands and it has allowed changes in prices for private
agricultural output Also the new regime is permitting the
establishment of private enterprises of 20 or fewer employees in
services handicrafts and smallscale industry Furthermore the
government has halted the old policy of diverting food from domestic
consumption to hard currency export markets So far the government
does not seem willing to adopt a thoroughgoing market system

 Economy
Overview About 40 of GDP comes from the agricultural sector coffee
and tea make up 8090 of total exports The amount of fertile land is limited
however and deforestation and soil erosion have created problems The
industrial sector in Rwanda is small contributing less than 20 to GDP
Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of agricultural products
The Rwandan economy remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid
with no relief in sight Weak international prices since 1986 have
caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to decline

 Economy
Overview The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood
by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of
Newfoundland The economy has been declining however because the number
of ships stopping at St Pierre has steadily dropped over the years In
March 1989 an agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for
St Pierres trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadianclaimed waters for
three years The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had
virtually brought fish exports to a halt The islands are heavily
subsidized by France Imports come primarily from Canada

important sector of the economy providing employment for over 60 of the labor
force and contributing about 20 to GDP The services sector is next in
importance based mostly on a growing tourist industry The economy
continues to have a high unemployment rate of 30 because of an
overdependence on the weatherplagued banana crop as a major export earner

unsuccessful

 Economy
Overview The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the
gained independence nearly 15 years ago Since then however cocoa
production has gradually deteriorated because of drought and
mismanagement so that by 1987 output had fallen to less than 50 of
its former levels As a result a shortage of cocoa for export has
created a serious balanceofpayments problem Production of less
important crops such as coffee copra and palm kernels has
also declined The value of imports generally exceeds that of
exports by a ratio of 4 to 1 The emphasis on cocoa production at
the expense of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import
90 of food needs It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured
goods Over the years Sao Tome has been unable to service its external
debt which amounts to roughly 80 of export earnings Considerable
potential exists for development of a tourist industry and the
government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years The
government also implemented a FiveYear Plan covering 198690 to
restructure the economy and reschedule external debt service payments in
cooperation with the International Development Association and Western
lenders

 Economy
Overview The agricultural sector accounts for about 20 of GDP and
provides employment for about 75 of the labor force About 40 of the total
cultivated land is used to grow peanuts an important export crop The principal
economic resource is fishing which brought in about 200 million or about 25
of total foreign exchange earnings in 1987 Mining is dominated by the
extraction of phosphate but production has faltered because of reduced
worldwide demand for fertilizers in recent years Over the past 10 years tourism
has become increasingly more important to the economy

 Economy
Overview Many of the white oneseventh of the South African
population enjoy incomes material comforts and health and educational
standards equal to those of Western Europe In contrast most of the
remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third
World including unemployment lack of job skills and barriers to
movement into higherpaying fields Inputs and outputs thus do not move
smoothly into the most productive employments and the effectiveness
of the market is further lowered by international constraints on
dealings with South Africa The main strength of the economy lies in
its rich mineral resources which provide twothirds of exports
Average growth of 2 in output in recent years falls far short of the
level needed to cut into the high unemployment level

 Economy
Overview The first five years of perestroyka economic
restructuring have undermined the institutions and processes of the
Soviet command economy without replacing them with efficiently
functioning markets The initial reforms featured greater authority for
enterprise managers over prices wages product mix investment sources
of supply and customers But in the absence of effective market
discipline the result was the disappearance of lowprice goods
excessive wage increases an even larger volume of unfinished
construction projects and in general continued economic stagnation
The Gorbachev regime has made at least four serious errors in economic
policy in these five years the unpopular and shortlived antialcohol
campaign the initial cutback in imports of consumer goods the failure
to act decisively for the privatization of agriculture and the buildup
of a massive overhang of unspent rubles in the hands of households and
enterprises In October 1989 a top economic adviser Leonid Abalkin
presented an ambitious but reasonable timetable for the conversion to a
partially privatized market system in the 1990s In December 1989
however Premier Ryzhkovs conservative approach prevailed namely the
contention that a period of retrenchment was necessary to provide a
stable financial and legislative base for launching further reforms
Accordingly the new strategy was to put the reform process on hold in
199092 by recentralizing economic authority and to placate the
rankandfile through sharp increases in consumer goods output In still
another policy twist the leadership in early 1990 was considering a
marked speedup in the marketization process Because the economy is
caught in between two systems there was in 1989 an even greater mismatch
between what was produced and what would serve the best interests of
enterprises and households Meanwhile the seething nationality problems
have been dislocating regional patterns of economic specialization and
pose a further major threat to growth prospects over the next few years

real GNP of 55 in 1987 and about 5 in 1988 and 1989 Spain has been
the fastest growing member of the EC Increased investmentboth
domestic and foreignhas been the most important factor pushing the
economic expansion Inflation moderated to 48 in 1988 but an
overheated economy caused inflation to reach an estimated 7 in 1989
Another economic problem facing Spain is an unemployment rate of 165

 Economy
Overview The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry which
accounts for about 80 of export earnings and 40 of tax revenues The
economy has been in trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in
1982 A drop in world bauxite prices that started in the late 1970s and
continued until late 1986 was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla
insurgency in the interior The guerrillas targeted the economic
infrastructure crippling the important bauxite sector and shutting down
other export industries These problems have created both high inflation
and high unemployment A small gain in economic growth of 36 was
registered in 1988 due to reduced guerrilla activity and improved
international markets for bauxite

 Economy
Overview Switzerlands economic success is matched in few if any
other nations Per capita output general living standards education
and science health care and diet are unsurpassed in Europe Inflation
remains low because of sound government policy and harmonious
labormanagement relations Unemployment is negligible a marked
contrast to the larger economies of Western Europe This economic
stability helps promote the important banking and tourist sectors Since
World War II Switzerlands economy has adjusted smoothly to the great
changes in output and trade patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust
to the challenges of the 1990s in particular the further economic
integration of Western Europe and the amazingly rapid changes in East

 Economy
Overview Syrias rigidly structured Bathist economy is turning out
roughly the same amount of goods in 1989 as in 1983 when the population
was 20 smaller Economic difficulties are attributable in part to severe
drought in several recent years costly but unsuccessful attempts to match
Israels military strength a falloff in Arab aid and insufficient foreign
exchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry and agriculture Socialist
policy embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic regulations in many instances
has driven away or pushed underground the mercantile and entrepreneurial spirit
for which Syrian businessmen have long been famous Two bright spots a sizable
number of villagers have benefited from land redistribution electrification
and other rural development programs and a recent find of light crude oil
has enabled Syria to cut back its substantial imports of light crude A
longterm concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by
Turkey when its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed toward the end
of the 1990s

 Economy
Overview Trinidad and Tobagos petroleumbased economy has been in
decline since 1982 During the first half of the 1980s the petroleum sector
accounted for nearly 80 of export earnings 40 of government revenues
and almost 25 of GDP In recent years however the economy has suffered
because of the sharp fall in the price of oil The government in response to
the revenue loss pursued a series of austerity measures that pushed the
unemployment rate to 22 in 1988 Agriculture employs only about 11 of
the labor force and produces less than 3 of GDP Since this sector is small it
has been unable to absorb the large numbers of the unemployed The
government currently seeks to diversify its export base

failures have strained the governments budget and increased
unemployment The current account fell from a 23 million surplus in
1988 to a 390 million deficit in 1989 Despite its foreign payments
problems Tunis appears committed to its IMFsupported structural
adjustment program Nonetheless the government may have to slow its
implementation to head off labor unrest The increasing foreign

 Economy
Overview The economic reforms that Turkey launched in 1980 continue
to bring an impressive stream of benefits The economy has grown steadily since
the early 1980s with real growth in per capita GDP increasing more than 6
annually Agriculture remains the most important economic sector
employing about 60 of the labor force accounting for almost 20 of GDP and
contributing about 25 to exports Impressive growth in recent years has not
solved all of the economic problems facing Turkey Inflation and interest rates
remain high and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties
for a country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally
controlled to a free market economy The government has launched a
multimilliondollar development program in the southeastern region which
includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to
generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland The planned
tapping of huge quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious concern in the
downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq

 Economy
Overview Uganda has substantial natural resources including fertile
soils regular rainfall and sizable mineral deposits of copper and
cobalt For most of the past 15 years the economy has been devastated by
political instability mismanagement and civil war keeping Uganda poor
with a per capita income of about 300 GDP remains below the levels
of the early 1970s as does industrial production Agriculture is the
most important sector of the economy employing over 80 of the work
force Coffee is the major export crop and accounted for 97 of export
revenues in 1988 Since 1986 the government has acted to rehabilitate and
stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform raising producer
prices on export crops increasing petroleum prices and
improving civil service wages The policy changes are especially aimed at
dampening inflation which was running at over 300 in 1987 and boosting
production and export earnings

transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to a
modern state with a high standard of living At present levels of production

 Economy
Overview The UK is one of the worlds great trading powers and
financial centers and its economy ranks among the four largest in
Europe The economy is essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture
of social welfare programs and government ownership Over the last decade
the Thatcher government has halted the expansion of welfare measures and
has promoted extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector
Agriculture is intensive highly mechanized and efficient by European
standards producing about 60 of food needs with only 1 of the labor
force Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises employing
about 24 of the work force and generating 22 of GDP The UK is an
energyrich nation with large coal natural gas and oil reserves
primary energy production accounts for 12 of GDP one of the highest
shares of any industrial nation Following the recession of 197981 the
economy has enjoyed the longest period of continuous economic growth it
has had during the last 30 years During the period 198289 real GDP grew
by about 25 while the inflation rate of 14 was nearly halved Between
1986 and 1989 unemployment fell from 11 to about 6 As a major trading
nation the UK will continue to be greatly affected by world boom or
recession swings in the international oil market productivity trends in
domestic industry and the terms on which the economic integration of
Europe proceeds

 Economy
Overview The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession of
198184 In 1986 real GDP grew by 66 and in 1987 by 49 The recovery
was led by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors agriculture
alone contributing 20 to GDP employing about 11 of the labor force and
generating a large proportion of export earnings Raising livestock
particularly cattle and sheep is the major agricultural activity In
1988 despite healthy exports and an improved current account domestic
growth slowed because of government concentration on the external sector
adverse weather conditions and prolonged strikes High inflation rates
of about 80 a large domestic debt and frequent strikes remain major economic
problems for the government

 Economy
Overview This is a centrally planned developing economy with
extensive government ownership and control of productive facilities
The economy is primarily agricultural employing about 65 of the labor
force and accounting for almost half of GNP Rice is the staple crop
substantial amounts of maize sorghum cassava and sweet potatoes are
also grown The government permits sale of surplus grain on the open
market Most of the mineral resources are located in the north
including coal which is an important export item Following the
end of the war in 1975 heavy handed government measures undermined
efforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the
south and the industrial resources of the north The economy remains
heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from
Communist countries Sweden and UN agencies Inflation although down
from recent tripledigit levels is still a major weakness and per
capita output is among the worlds lowest Since early 1989 the
government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more
economic activity over to the private sector

Country West Bank
Note The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with
Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai and the Golan
Heights As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by President
Reagans 1 September 1982 peace initiative the final status of the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a peace
treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned
parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the
respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process it is US policy
that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be
determined In the view of the US the term West Bank describes all of the
area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the 1967
ArabIsraeli war However with respect to negotiations envisaged in the
framework agreement it is US policy that a distinction must be made between
Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys special status
and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the final status of
Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West
Bank

Note The West Bank is currently governed by Israeli military authorities

These negotiations will determine how the area is to be governed

 Economy
Overview Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli
military occupation and the effects of the Palestinian uprising Industries
using advanced technology or requiring sizable financial resources have been
discouraged by a lack of financial resources and Israeli policy Capital
investment has largely gone into residential housing not into productive assets
that could compete with Israeli industry A major share of GNP is derived from
remittances of workers employed in Israel and neighboring Gulf states Israeli
reprisals against Palestinian unrest in the West Bank since 1987 have pushed
unemployment up and lowered living standards

 Economy
Overview In 1989 the World economy grew at an estimated 30
somewhat lower than the estimated 34 for 1988 The technologically advanced
areasNorth America Japan and Western Europetogether account for
65 of the gross world product GWP of 203 trillion these developed
areas grew in the aggregate at 35 In contrast the Communist Second
World countries typically grew at between 0 and 2 accounting for 23 of GWP
Experience in the developing countries continued mixed with the newly
industrializing countries generally maintaining their rapid growth and many
others struggling with debt inflation and inadequate investment The year
1989 ended with remarkable political upheavals in the Communist
countries which presumably will dislocate economic production still further
The addition of nearly 100 million people a year to an already overcrowded
globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution desertification
underemployment and poverty throughout the 1990s

dispersed population and an arid climate make economic development
difficult The economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 23
since the mid1970s The economy is organized along socialist lines
dominated by the public sector Economic growth has been constrained by a
lack of incentives partly stemming from centralized control over production

 Economy
Overview Titos reform programs 20 years ago changed the Stalinist
command economy to a decentralized semimarket system but a system that
the rigid ethnically divided political structure ultimately could not
accommodate A prominent feature of the reforms was the establishment
of workers selfmanagement councils in all large plants which were to
select managers stimulate production and divide the proceeds The
general result of these reforms has been rampant wageprice inflation
substantial rundown of capital plant consumer shortages and a still
larger income gap between the poorer southern regions and the relatively
affluent northern provinces of Hrvatska and Slovenija In 198889 the
beleaguered central government has been reforming the reforms trying
to create an open market economy with still considerable state
ownership of major industrial plants These reforms have been moving
forward with the advice and support of the International Monetary Fund
through a series of tough negotiations Selfmanagement supposedly is
to be replaced by the discipline of the market and by fiscal austerity
ultimately leading to a stable dinar However strikes in major plants
hyperinflation and interregional political jousting have held back
progress According to US economic advisers only a highly unlikely
combination of genuine privatization massive Western economic
investment and aid and political moderation can salvage this economy

developed and diversified economies in SubSaharan Africa Zaire had
a GDP per capita of 195 one of the lowest on the continent Agriculture
a key sector of the economy employs 75 of the population but generates
under 30 of GDP The main impetus for economic development has been the
extractive industries Mining and mineral processing account for about
onethird of GDP and twothirds of total export earnings During the period
198388 the economy experienced slow growth high inflation a rising foreign
debt and a drop in foreign exchange earnings Recent increases in foreign
prices for coppera key export earnerand other minerals offer some hope of
reversing the economic decline Zaire is the worlds largest producer of
diamonds

 Economy
Overview Despite temporary growth in 1988 the economy has been in
decline for more than a decade with falling imports and growing foreign
debt Economic difficulties stem from a sustained drop in copper production
and ineffective economic policies In 1988 real GDP stood only slightly
higher than that of 10 years before while an annual population growth of
more than 3 has brought a decline in per capita GDP of 25 during the same
period A high inflation rate has also added to Zambias economic woes in
recent years

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
