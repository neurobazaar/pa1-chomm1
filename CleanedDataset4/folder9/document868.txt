Myself I do not believe this story Six persons are persuaded of its
truth and the hope of these six is to convince themselves it was an
hallucination Their difficulty is there are six of them Each one alone
perceives clearly that it never could have been Unfortunately they are
close friends and cannot get away from one another and when they meet
and look into each others eyes the thing takes shape again

The one who told it to me and who immediately wished he had not
was Armitage He told it to me one night when he and I were the only
occupants of the Club smokingroom His telling meas he explained
afterwardswas an impulse of the moment Sense of the thing had been
pressing upon him all that day with unusual persistence and the
idea had occurred to him on my entering the room that the flippant
scepticism with which an essentially commonplace mind like my ownhe
used the words in no offensive sensewould be sure to regard the affair
might help to direct his own attention to its more absurd aspect I
am inclined to think it did He thanked me for dismissing his entire
narrative as the delusion of a disordered brain and begged me not to
mention the matter to another living soul I promised and I may as well
here observe that I do not call this mentioning the matter Armitage
is not the mans real name it does not even begin with an A You might
read this story and dine next to him the same evening you would know
nothing

Also of course I did not consider myself debarred from speaking about
it discreetly to Mrs Armitage a charming woman She burst into tears
at the first mention of the thing It took me all I knew to tranquillize
her She said that when she did not think about the thing she could be
happy She and Armitage never spoke of it to one another and left to
themselves her opinion was that eventually they might put remembrance
behind them She wished they were not quite so friendly with the
Everetts Mr and Mrs Everett had both dreamt precisely the same dream
that is assuming it was a dream Mr Everett was not the sort of person
that a clergyman ought perhaps to know but as Armitage would always
argue for a teacher of Christianity to withdraw his friendship from
a man because that man was somewhat of a sinner would be inconsistent
Rather should he remain his friend and seek to influence him They
dined with the Everetts regularly on Tuesdays and sitting opposite the
Everetts it seemed impossible to accept as a fact that all four of them
at the same time and in the same manner had fallen victims to the
same illusion I think I succeeded in leaving her more hopeful She
acknowledged that the story looked at from the point of common sense
did sound ridiculous and threatened me that if I ever breathed a word
of it to anyone she never would speak to me again She is a charming
woman as I have already mentioned

By a curious coincidence I happened at the time to be one of Everetts
directors on a Company he had just promoted for taking over and
developing the Red Sea Coasting trade I lunched with him the following
Sunday He is an interesting talker and curiosity to discover how
so shrewd a man would account for his connection with so insaneso
impossible a fancy prompted me to hint my knowledge of the story The
manner both of him and of his wife changed suddenly They wanted to
know who it was had told me I refused the information because it was
evident they would have been angry with him Everetts theory was
that one of them had dreamt itprobably Camelfordand by hypnotic
suggestion had conveyed to the rest of them the impression that they had
dreamt it also He added that but for one slight incident he should have
ridiculed from the very beginning the argument that it could have been
anything else than a dream But what that incident was he would not tell
me His object as he explained was not to dwell upon the business but
to try and forget it Speaking as a friend he advised me likewise
not to cackle about the matter any more than I could help lest trouble
should arise with regard to my directors fees His way of putting
things is occasionally blunt

It was at the Everetts later on that I met Mrs Camelford one of the
handsomest women I have ever set eyes upon It was foolish of me but my
memory for names is weak I forgot that Mr and Mrs Camelford were the
other two concerned and mentioned the story as a curious tale I had
read years ago in an old Miscellany I had reckoned on it to lead me
into a discussion with her on platonic friendship She jumped up from
her chair and gave me a look I remembered then and could have bitten
out my tongue It took me a long while to make my peace but she came
round in the end consenting to attribute my blunder to mere stupidity
She was quite convinced herself she told me that the thing was pure
imagination It was only when in company with the others that any doubt
as to this crossed her mind Her own idea was that if everybody
would agree never to mention the matter again it would end in
their forgetting it She supposed it was her husband who had been my
informant he was just that sort of ass She did not say it unkindly
She said when she was first married ten years ago few people had a
more irritating effect upon her than had Camelford but that since she
had seen more of other men she had come to respect him I like to hear a
woman speak well of her husband It is a departure which in my opinion
should be more encouraged than it is I assured her Camelford was not
the culprit and on the understanding that I might come to see hernot
too oftenon her Thursdays I agreed with her that the best thing I
could do would be to dismiss the subject from my mind and occupy myself
instead with questions that concerned myself

I had never talked much with Camelford before that time though I had
often seen him at the Club He is a strange man of whom many stories
are told He writes journalism for a living and poetry which he
publishes at his own expense apparently for recreation It occurred to
me that his theory would at all events be interesting but at first he
would not talk at all pretending to ignore the whole affair as idle
nonsense I had almost despaired of drawing him out when one evening
of his own accord he asked me if I thought Mrs Armitage with whom
he knew I was on terms of friendship still attached importance to the
thing On my expressing the opinion that Mrs Armitage was the most
troubled of the group he was irritated and urged me to leave the rest
of them alone and devote whatever sense I might possess to persuading
her in particular that the entire thing was and could be nothing but
pure myth He confessed frankly that to him it was still a mystery He
could easily regard it as chimera but for one slight incident He would
not for a long while say what that was but there is such a thing as
perseverance and in the end I dragged it out of him This is what he
told me

We happened by chance to find ourselves alone in the conservatory that
night of the ballwe six Most of the crowd had already left The last
extra was being played the music came to us faintly Stooping to
pick up Jessicas fan which she had let fall to the ground something
shining on the tesselated pavement underneath a group of palms suddenly
caught my eye We had not said a word to one another indeed it was
the first evening we had any of us met one anotherthat is unless the
thing was not a dream I picked it up The others gathered round me and
when we looked into one anothers eyes we understood it was a broken
winecup a curious goblet of Bavarian glass It was the goblet out of
which we had all dreamt that we had drunk

I have put the story together as it seems to me it must have happened
The incidents at all events are facts Things have since occurred to
those concerned affording me hope that they will never read it I should
not have troubled to tell it at all but that it has a moral



Six persons sat round the great oak table in the wainscoted _Speise
Saal_ of that cosy hostelry the Kneiper Hof at Konigsberg It was late
into the night Under ordinary circumstances they would have been in
bed but having arrived by the last train from Dantzic and having
supped on German fare it had seemed to them discreeter to remain awhile
in talk The house was strangely silent The rotund landlord leaving
their candles ranged upon the sideboard had wished them Gute Nacht
an hour before The spirit of the ancient house enfolded them within its
wings

Here in this very chamber if rumour is to be believed Emmanuel Kant
himself had sat discoursing many a time and oft The walls behind which
for more than forty years the little peakfaced man had thought and
worked rose silvered by the moonlight just across the narrow way the
three high windows of the _Speise Saal_ give out upon the old Cathedral
tower beneath which now he rests Philosophy curious concerning human
phenomena eager for experience unhampered by the limitation Convention
would impose upon all speculation was in the smoky air

Not into future events remarked the Rev Nathaniel Armitage it
is better they should be hidden from us But into the future of
ourselvesour temperament our characterI think we ought to be
allowed to see At twenty we are one individual at forty another
person entirely with other views with other interests a different
outlook upon life attracted by quite other attributes repelled by the
very qualities that once attracted us It is extremely awkward for all
of us

I am glad to hear somebody else say that observed Mrs Everett in
her gentle sympathetic voice I have thought it all myself so often
Sometimes I have blamed myself yet how can one help it the things that
appeared of importance to us they become indifferent new voices call
to us the idols we once worshipped we see their feet of clay

If under the head of idols you include me laughed the jovial Mr
Everett dont hesitate to say so He was a large redfaced gentleman
with small twinkling eyes and a mouth both strong and sensuous I
didnt make my feet myself I never asked anybody to take me for a
stainedglass saint It is not I who have changed

I know dear it is I his thin wife answered with a meek smile I
was beautiful there was no doubt about it when you married me

You were my dear agreed her husband As a girl few could hold a
candle to you

It was the only thing about me that you valued my beauty continued
his wife and it went so quickly I feel sometimes as if I had swindled
you

But there is a beauty of the mind of the soul remarked the Rev
Nathaniel Armitage that to some men is more attractive than mere
physical perfection

The soft eyes of the faded lady shone for a moment with the light of
pleasure I am afraid Dick is not of that number she sighed

Well as I said just now about my feet answered her husband genially
I didnt make myself I always have been a slave to beauty and always
shall be There would be no sense in pretending among chums that you
havent lost your looks old girl He laid his fine hand with kindly
intent upon her bony shoulder But there is no call for you to fret
yourself as if you had done it on purpose No one but a lover imagines a
woman growing more beautiful as she grows older

Some women would seem to answered his wife

Involuntarily she glanced to where Mrs Camelford sat with elbows
resting on the table and involuntarily also the small twinkling eyes of
her husband followed in the same direction There is a type that reaches
its prime in middle age Mrs Camelford _nee_ Jessica Dearwood at
twenty had been an uncannylooking creature the only thing about her
appealing to general masculine taste having been her magnificent eyes
and even these had frightened more than they had allured At forty Mrs
Camelford might have posed for the entire Juno

Yes hes a cunning old joker is Time murmured Mr Everett almost
inaudibly

What ought to have happened said Mrs Armitage while with deft
fingers rolling herself a cigarette was for you and Nellie to have
married

Mrs Everetts pale face flushed scarlet

My dear exclaimed the shocked Nathaniel Armitage flushing likewise

Oh why may one not sometimes speak the truth answered his wife
petulantly You and I are utterly unsuited to one anothereverybody
sees it At nineteen it seemed to me beautiful holy the idea of being
a clergymans wife fighting by his side against evil Besides you have
changed since then You were human my dear Nat in those days and
the best dancer I had ever met It was your dancing was your chief
attraction for me as likely as not if I had only known myself At
nineteen how can one know oneself

We loved each other the Rev Armitage reminded her

I know we did passionatelythen but we dont now She laughed a
little bitterly Poor Nat I am only another trial added to your
long list Your beliefs your ideals are meaningless to memere
narrowminded dogmas stifling thought Nellie was the wife Nature had
intended for you so soon as she had lost her beauty and with it all her
worldly ideas Fate was maturing her for you if only we had known
As for me I ought to have been the wife of an artist of a poet
Unconsciously a glance from her ever restless eyes flashed across the
table to where Horatio Camelford sat puffing clouds of smoke into
the air from a huge black meerschaum pipe Bohemia is my country Its
poverty its struggle would have been a joy to me Breathing its free
air life would have been worth living

Horatio Camelford leant back with eyes fixed on the oaken ceiling It
is a mistake said Horatio Camelford for the artist ever to marry

The handsome Mrs Camelford laughed goodnaturedly The artist
remarked Mrs Camelford from what I have seen of him would never know
the inside of his shirt from the outside if his wife was not there to
take it out of the drawer and put it over his head

His wearing it inside out would not make much difference to the world
argued her husband The sacrifice of his art to the necessity of
keeping his wife and family does

Well you at all events do not appear to have sacrificed much my boy
came the breezy voice of Dick Everett Why all the world is ringing
with your name

When I am fortyone with all the best years of my life behind me
answered the Poet Speaking as a man I have nothing to regret No one
could have had a better wife my children are charming I have lived
the peaceful existence of the successful citizen Had I been true to my
trust I should have gone out into the wilderness the only possible
home of the teacher the prophet The artist is the bridegroom of Art
Marriage for him is an immorality Had I my time again I should remain a
bachelor

Time brings its revenges you see laughed Mrs Camelford At twenty
that fellow threatened to commit suicide if I would not marry him and
cordially disliking him I consented Now twenty years later when I am
just getting used to him he calmly turns round and says he would have
been better without me

I heard something about it at the time said Mrs Armitage You were
very much in love with somebody else were you not

Is not the conversation assuming a rather dangerous direction laughed
Mrs Camelford

I was thinking the same thing agreed Mrs Everett One would imagine
some strange influence had seized upon us forcing us to speak our
thoughts aloud

I am afraid I was the original culprit admitted the Reverend
Nathaniel This room is becoming quite oppressive Had we not better go
to bed

The ancient lamp suspended from its smokegrimed beam uttered a faint
gurgling sob and spluttered out The shadow of the old Cathedral
tower crept in and stretched across the room now illuminated only by
occasional beams from the cloudcurtained moon At the other end of the
table sat a peakfaced little gentleman cleanshaven in fullbottomed
wig

Forgive me said the little gentleman He spoke in English with a
strong accent But it seems to me here is a case where two parties
might be of service to one another

The six fellowtravellers round the table looked at one another but
none spoke The idea that came to each of them as they explained to
one another later was that without remembering it they had taken their
candles and had gone to bed This was surely a dream

It would greatly assist me continued the little peakfaced gentleman
in experiments I am conducting into the phenomena of human tendencies
if you would allow me to put your lives back twenty years

Still no one of the six replied It seemed to them that the little
old gentleman must have been sitting there among them all the time
unnoticed by them

Judging from your talk this evening continued the peakfaced little
gentleman you should welcome my offer You appear to me to be one and
all of exceptional intelligence You perceive the mistakes that you have
made you understand the causes The future veiled you could not help
yourselves What I propose to do is to put you back twenty years
You will be boys and girls again but with this difference that the
knowledge of the future so far as it relates to yourselves will remain
with you

Come urged the old gentleman the thing is quite simple of
accomplishment Asas a certain philosopher has clearly proved the
universe is only the result of our own perceptions By what may appear
to you to be magicby what in reality will be simply a chemical
operationI remove from your memory the events of the last twenty
years with the exception of what immediately concerns your own
personalities You will retain all knowledge of the changes physical
and mental that will be in store for you all else will pass from your
perception

The little old gentleman took a small phial from his waistcoat pocket
and filling one of the massive wineglasses from a decanter measured
into it some halfadozen drops Then he placed the glass in the centre
of the table

Youth is a good time to go back to said the peakfaced little
gentleman with a smile Twenty years ago it was the night of the Hunt
Ball You remember it

It was Everett who drank first He drank it with his little twinkling
eyes fixed hungrily on the proud handsome face of Mrs Camelford and
then handed the glass to his wife It was she perhaps who drank from
it most eagerly Her life with Everett from the day when she had risen
from a bed of sickness stripped of all her beauty had been one bitter
wrong She drank with the wild hope that the thing might possibly be
not a dream and thrilled to the touch of the man she loved as reaching
across the table he took the glass from her hand Mrs Armitage was the
fourth to drink She took the cup from her husband drank with a quiet
smile and passed it on to Camelford And Camelford drank looking at
nobody and replaced the glass upon the table

Come said the little old gentleman to Mrs Camelford you are the
only one left The whole thing will be incomplete without you

I have no wish to drink said Mrs Camelford and her eyes sought
those of her husband but he would not look at her

Come again urged the Figure And then Camelford looked at her and
laughed drily

You had better drink he said Its only a dream

If you wish it she answered And it was from his hands she took the
glass



It is from the narrative as Armitage told it to me that night in the
Club smokingroom that I am taking most of my material It seemed to him
that all things began slowly to rise upward leaving him stationary but
with a great pain as though the inside of him were being torn awaythe
same sensation greatly exaggerated so he likened it as descending in
a lift But around him all the time was silence and darkness unrelieved
After a period that might have been minutes that might have been years
a faint light crept towards him It grew stronger and into the air
which now fanned his cheek there stole the sound of faroff music The
light and the music both increased and one by one his senses came back
to him He was seated on a low cushioned bench beneath a group of palms
A young girl was sitting beside him but her face was turned away from
him

I did not catch your name he was saying Would you mind telling it
to me

She turned her face towards him It was the most spiritually beautiful
face he had ever seen I am in the same predicament she laughed You
had better write yours on my programme and I will write mine on yours

So they wrote upon each others programme and exchanged again The name
she had written was Alice Blatchley

He had never seen her before that he could remember Yet at the back of
his mind there dwelt the haunting knowledge of her Somewhere long ago
they had met talked together Slowly as one recalls a dream it came
back to him In some other life vague shadowy he had married this
woman For the first few years they had loved each other then the gulf
had opened between them widened Stern strong voices had called to him
to lay aside his selfish dreams his boyish ambitions to take upon his
shoulders the yoke of a great duty When more than ever he had demanded
sympathy and help this woman had fallen away from him His ideals but
irritated her Only at the cost of daily bitterness had he been able to
resist her endeavours to draw him from his path A facethat of a
woman with soft eyes full of helpfulness shone through the mist of
his dreamthe face of a woman who would one day come to him out of the
Future with outstretched hands that he would yearn to clasp

Shall we not dance said the voice beside him I really wont sit out
a waltz

They hurried into the ballroom With his arm about her form her
wondrous eyes shyly at rare moments seeking his then vanishing again
behind their drooping lashes the brain the mind the very soul of the
young man passed out of his own keeping She complimented him in her
bewitching manner a delightful blending of condescension and timidity

You dance extremely well she told him You may ask me for another
later on

The words flashed out from that dim haunting future Your dancing was
your chief attraction for me as likely as not had I but known

All that evening and for many months to come the Present and the Future
fought within him And the experience of Nathaniel Armitage divinity
student was the experience likewise of Alice Blatchley who had fallen
in love with him at first sight having found him the divinest dancer
she had ever whirled with to the sensuous music of the waltz of Horatio
Camelford journalist and minor poet whose journalism earned him a bare
income but at whose minor poetry critics smiled of Jessica Dearwood
with her glorious eyes and muddy complexion and her wild hopeless
passion for the big handsome ruddybearded Dick Everett who knowing
it only laughed at her in his kindly lordly way telling her with
frank brutalness that the woman who was not beautiful had missed her
vocation in life of that scheming conquering young gentleman himself
who at twentyfive had already made his mark in the City shrewd
clever coolheaded as a fox except where a pretty face and shapely
hand or ankle were concerned of Nellie Fanshawe then in the pride of
her ravishing beauty who loved none but herself whose claymade gods
were jewels and fine dresses and rich feasts the envy of other women
and the courtship of all mankind

That evening of the ball each clung to the hope that this memory of the
future was but a dream They had been introduced to one another had
heard each others names for the first time with a start of recognition
had avoided one anothers eyes had hastened to plunge into meaningless
talk till that moment when young Camelford stooping to pick up
Jessicas fan had found that broken fragment of the Rhenish wineglass
Then it was that conviction refused to be shaken off that knowledge of
the future had to be sadly accepted

What they had not foreseen was that knowledge of the future in no way
affected their emotions of the present Nathaniel Armitage grew day by
day more hopelessly in love with bewitching Alice Blatchley The thought
of her marrying anyone elsethe longhaired priggish Camelford in
particularsent the blood boiling through his veins added to which
sweet Alice with her arms about his neck would confess to him that
life without him would be a misery hardly to be endured that the
thought of him as the husband of another womanof Nellie Fanshawe in
particularwas madness to her It was right perhaps knowing what
they did that they should say goodbye to one another She would bring
sorrow into his life Better far that he should put her away from him
that she should die of a broken heart as she felt sure she would How
could he a fond lover inflict this suffering upon her He ought of
course to marry Nellie Fanshawe but he could not bear the girl Would
it not be the height of absurdity to marry a girl he strongly disliked
because twenty years hence she might be more suitable to him than the
woman he now loved and who loved him

Nor could Nellie Fanshawe bring herself to discuss without laughter the
suggestion of marrying on a hundredandfifty a year a curate that
she positively hated There would come a time when wealth would be
indifferent to her when her exalted spirit would ask but for the
satisfaction of selfsacrifice But that time had not arrived The
emotions it would bring with it she could not in her present state even
imagine Her whole present being craved for the things of this world
the things that were within her grasp To ask her to forego them now
because later on she would not care for them it was like telling a
schoolboy to avoid the tuckshop because when a man the thought of
stickjaw would be nauseous to him If her capacity for enjoyment was to
be shortlived all the more reason for grasping joy quickly

Alice Blatchley when her lover was not by gave herself many a headache
trying to think the thing out logically Was it not foolish of her to
rush into this marriage with dear Nat At forty she would wish she
had married somebody else But most women at fortyshe judged from
conversation round about herwished they had married somebody else If
every girl at twenty listened to herself at forty there would be no
more marriage At forty she would be a different person altogether That
other elderly person did not interest her To ask a young girl to spoil
her life purely in the interests of this middleaged partyit did not
seem right Besides whom else was she to marry Camelford would not
have her he did not want her then he was not going to want her at
forty For practical purposes Camelford was out of the question She
might marry somebody else altogetherand fare worse She might remain
a spinster she hated the mere name of spinster The inkyfingered woman
journalist that if all went well she might become it was not her
idea Was she acting selfishly Ought she in his own interests to
refuse to marry dear Nat Nelliethe little catwho would suit him at
forty would not have him If he was going to marry anyone but Nellie he
might as well marry her Alice A bachelor clergyman it sounded almost
improper Nor was dear Nat the type If she threw him over it would be
into the arms of some designing minx What was she to do

Camelford at forty under the influence of favourable criticism would
have persuaded himself he was a heavensent prophet his whole life
to be beautifully spent in the saving of mankind At twenty he felt he
wanted to live Weirdlooking Jessica with her magnificent eyes veiling
mysteries was of more importance to him than the rest of the species
combined Knowledge of the future in his ease only spurred desire The
muddy complexion would grow pink and white the thin limbs round and
shapely the now scornful eyes would one day light with love at his
coming It was what he had once hoped it was what he now knew At forty
the artist is stronger than the man at twenty the man is stronger than
the artist

An uncanny creature so most folks would have described Jessica
Dearwood Few would have imagined her developing into the goodnatured
easygoing Mrs Camelford of middle age The animal so strong within
her at twenty at thirty had burnt itself out At eighteen madly
blindly in love with redbearded deepvoiced Dick Everett she would
had he whistled to her have flung herself gratefully at his feet and
this in spite of the knowledge forewarning her of the miserable life
he would certainly lead her at all events until her slowly developing
beauty should give her the whip hand of himby which time she would
have come to despise him Fortunately as she told herself there was
no fear of his doing so the future notwithstanding Nellie Fanshawes
beauty held him as with chains of steel and Nellie had no intention
of allowing her rich prize to escape her Her own lover it was true
irritated her more than any man she had ever met but at least he
would afford her refuge from the bread of charity Jessica Dearwood an
orphan had been brought up by a distant relative She had not been the
child to win affection Of silent brooding nature every thoughtless
incivility had been to her an insult a wrong Acceptance of young
Camelford seemed her only escape from a life that had become to her a
martyrdom At fortyone he would wish he had remained a bachelor but at
thirtyeight that would not trouble her She would know herself he was
much better off as he was Meanwhile she would have come to like him
to respect him He would be famous she would be proud of him Crying
into her pillowshe could not help itfor love of handsome Dick it
was still a comfort to reflect that Nellie Fanshawe as it were was
watching over her protecting her from herself

Dick as he muttered to himself a dozen times a day ought to marry
Jessica At thirtyeight she would be his ideal He looked at her as
she was at eighteen and shuddered Nellie at thirty would be plain and
uninteresting But when did consideration of the future ever cry halt
to passion when did a lover ever pause thinking of the morrow If her
beauty was to quickly pass was not that one reason the more urging him
to possess it while it lasted

Nellie Fanshawe at forty would be a saint The prospect did not please
her she hated saints She would love the tiresome solemn Nathaniel of
what use was that to her now He did not desire her he was in love with
Alice and Alice was in love with him What would be the senseeven if
they all agreedin the three of them making themselves miserable for
all their youth that they might be contented in their old age Let age
fend for itself and leave youth to its own instincts Let elderly saints
sufferit was their _metier_and youth drink the cup of life It was a
pity Dick was the only catch available but he was young and handsome
Other girls had to put up with sixty and the gout

Another point a very serious point had been overlooked All that had
arrived to them in that dim future of the past had happened to them as
the results of their making the marriages they had made To what fate
other roads would lead their knowledge could not tell them Nellie
Fanshawe had become at forty a lovely character Might not the hard life
she had led with her husbanda life calling for continual sacrifice
for daily selfcontrolhave helped towards this end As the wife of a
poor curate of high moral principles would the same result have been
secured The fever that had robbed her of her beauty and turned her
thoughts inward had been the result of sitting out on the balcony of the
Paris Opera House with an Italian Count on the occasion of a fancy dress
ball As the wife of an East End clergyman the chances are she would
have escaped that fever and its purifying effects Was there not danger
in the position a supremely beautiful young woman worldlyminded
hungry for pleasure condemned to a life of poverty with a man she did
not care for The influence of Alice upon Nathaniel Armitage during
those first years when his character was forming had been all for
good Could he be sure that married to Nellie he might not have
deteriorated

Were Alice Blatchley to marry an artist could she be sure that at forty
she would still be in sympathy with artistic ideals Even as a child had
not her desire ever been in the opposite direction to that favoured
by her nurse Did not the reading of Conservative journals invariably
incline her towards Radicalism and the steady stream of Radical talk
round her husbands table invariably set her seeking arguments in favour
of the feudal system Might it not have been her husbands growing
Puritanism that had driven her to crave for Bohemianism Suppose that
towards middle age the wife of a wild artist she suddenly took
religion as the saying is Her last state would be worse than the
first

Camelford was of delicate physique As an absentminded bachelor with
no one to give him his meals no one to see that his things were aired
could he have lived till forty Could he be sure that home life had not
given more to his art than it had taken from it

Jessica Dearwood of a nervous passionate nature married to a bad
husband might at forty have posed for one of the Furies Not until her
life had become restful had her good looks shown themselves Hers was
the type of beauty that for its development demands tranquillity

Dick Everett had no delusions concerning himself That had he married
Jessica he could for ten years have remained the faithful husband of a
singularly plain wife he knew to be impossible But Jessica would
have been no patient Griselda The extreme probability was that
having married her at twenty for the sake of her beauty at thirty at
twentynine at latest she would have divorced him

Everett was a man of practical ideas It was he who took the matter in
hand The refreshment contractor admitted that curious goblets of German
glass occasionally crept into their stock One of the waiters on the
understanding that in no case should he be called upon to pay for them
admitted having broken more than one wineglass on that particular
evening thought it not unlikely he might have attempted to hide the
fragments under a convenient palm The whole thing evidently was a
dream So youth decided at the time and the three marriages took place
within three months of one another

It was some ten years later that Armitage told me the story that night
in the Club smokingroom Mrs Everett had just recovered from a severe
attack of rheumatic fever contracted the spring before in Paris Mrs
Camelford whom previously I had not met certainly seemed to me one of
the handsomest women I have ever seen Mrs ArmitageI knew her when
she was Alice BlatchleyI found more charming as a woman than she
had been as a girl What she could have seen in Armitage I never could
understand Camelford made his mark some ten years later poor fellow
he did not live long to enjoy his fame Dick Everett has still another
six years to work off but he is well behaved and there is talk of a
petition

It is a curious story altogether I admit As I said at the beginning I
do not myself believe it
