THE CONQUEST OF CANAAN




I

ENTER CHORUS

A dry snow had fallen steadily throughout the still night so that when
a cold upper wind cleared the sky gloriously in the morning the
incongruous Indiana town shone in a white harmonyroof ledge and
earth as evenly covered as by moonlight There was no thaw only where
the line of factories followed the big bend of the frozen river their
distant chimneys like exclamation points on a blank page was there a
first threat against the supreme whiteness The wind passed quickly
and on high the shouting of the schoolchildren had ceased at nine
oclock with pitiful suddenness no sleighbells laughed out on the
air and the muffling of the thoroughfares wrought an unaccustomed
peace like that of Sunday This was the phenomenon which afforded the
opening of the morning debate of the sages in the wide windows of the
National House

Only such unfortunates as have so far failed to visit Canaan do not
know that the National House is on the Main Street side of the
Courthouse Square and has the advantage of being within two minutes
walk of the railroad station which is in plain sight of the
windowsan inestimable benefit to the conversation of the aged men who
occupied these windows on this white morning even as they were wont in
summer to hold against all comers the caneseated chairs on the
pavement outside Thence as trains came and went they commanded the
city gates and seeking motives and adding to the stock of history
narrowly observed and examined into all who entered or departed Their
habit was not singular He who would foolishly tax the sages of Canaan
with a bucolic lightmindedness must first walk in Piccadilly in early
June stroll down the Corso in Rome before Ash Wednesday or regard
those windows of Fifth Avenue whose curtains are withdrawn of a winter
Sunday for in each of these great streets wherever the windows not
of trade are widest his eyes must behold wise men like to those of
Canaan executing always their same purpose

The difference is in favor of Canaan the National House was the
club but the perusal of traveller or passer by was here only the spume
blown before a stately ship of thought and you might hear the sages
comparing the Koran with the speeches of Robert J Ingersoll

In the days of board sidewalks mailtime had meant a precise moment
for Canaan and even now many years after the first postman it
remained somewhat definite to the aged men for out of deference to a
pleasant olden custom and perhaps partly for an excuse to get down
to the hotel which was not altogether in favor with the elderly
ladies most of them retained their antique boxes in the postoffice
happily in the next building

In this connection it may be written that a subscription clerk in the
office of the Chicago Daily Standard having noted a single subscriber
from Canaan was a fortnight later pleased to receive by one mail
nine subscriptions from that promising town If one brought nine
others in a fortnight thought he what would nine bring in a month
Amazingly they brought nothing and the rest was silence Here was a
matter of intricate diplomacy never to come within that youth his ken
The morning voyage to the postoffice long mocked as a fable and
screen by the families of the sages had grown so difficult to
accomplish for one of them Colonel Flitcroft Colonel in the war with
Mexico that he had been put to it indeed to foot the firingline
against his wife a lady of celebrated determination and halevoiced at
seventy and to defend the rental of a box which had sheltered but
three missives in four years Desperation is often inspiration the
Colonel brilliantly subscribed for the Standard forgetting to give his
house address and it took the others just thirteen days to wring his
secret from him Then the Standard served for all

Mailtime had come to mean that bright hour when they all got their
feet on the brass rod which protected the sills of the two big windows
with the steamradiators sizzling like kettles against the side wall
Mr Jonas Tabor who had sold his hardware business magnificently not
magnificently for his nephew the purchaser some ten years before was
usually in spite of the fact that he remained a bachelor at
seventynine the last to settle down with the others though often the
first to reach the hotel which he always entered by a side door
because he did not believe in the treating system And it was Mr Eskew
Arp only seventyfive but already a thoroughly capable cynic who
almost invariably opened the argument and it was he who discovered
the sinister intention behind the weather of this particular morning
Mr Arp had not begun life so sourly as a youth he had been proud of
his given name which had come to him through his mothers family who
had made it honorable but many years of explanations that Eskew did
not indicate his initials had lowered his opinion of the intelligence
and morality of the race

The malevolence of his voice and manner this morning therefore when
he shook his finger at the town beyond the windows and exclaimed with
a bitter laugh Look at it was no surprise to his companions Jest
look at it I tell you the devil is mighty smart Ha ha Mighty
smart

Through custom it was the duty of Squire Buckalew Justice of the Peace
in 59 to be the first to take up Mr Arp The others looked to him
for it Therefore he asked sharply

Whats the devil got to do with snow

Everything to do with it sir Mr Arp retorted Its plain as day
to anybody with eyes and sense

Then I wish youd pint it out said Buckalew if youve got either

By the Almighty SquireMr Arp turned in his chair with sudden
heatif Id lived as long as you

You have interrupted the other stung Twelve years ago

If Id lived as long as you Mr Arp repeated unwincingly in a
louder voice and had follered Satans trail as long as you have and
yet couldnt recognize it when I see it Id git converted and vote
Prohibitionist

_I_ dont see it interjected Uncle Joe Davey in his querulous
voice He was the patriarch of them all _I_ cant find no
clovenhoofprints in the snow

All over it sir cried the cynic All over it Old Satan loves
tricks like this Heres a town thats jest one squirmin mass of lies
and envy and vice and wickedness and corruption

Hold on exclaimed Colonel Flitcroft Thats a slander upon our
hearths and our government Why when I was in the Council

It wasnt a bit worse then Mr Arp returned unreasonably Jest
you look how the devil fools us He drops down this here virgin mantle
on Canaan and makes it look as good as you pretend you think it is as
good as the Sundayschool room of a country churchthough THAThe
went off on a tangent venomouslyis generally only another whited
sepulchre and the superintendents mighty apt to have a bottle of
whiskey hid behind the organ and

Look here Eskew said Jonas Tabor thats got nothin to do with

Why aint it Answer me cried Mr Arp continuing without pause
Why aint it Cant you wait till I git through You listen to me
and when Im ready Ill listen to

See here began the Colonel making himself heard over three others
I want to ask you

No sir Mr Arp pounded the floor irascibly with his hickory stick
Dont you ask me anything How can you tell that Im not going to
answer your question without your asking it till Ive got through
You listen first I say heres a town of nearly thirty thousand
inhabitants every last one of emmen women and childrenselfish
and cowardly and sinful if you could see their innermost natures a
town of the ugliest and worst built houses in the world and governed
by a lot of saloonkeepersthough I hope it ll never git down to
where the ministers can run it And the devil comes along and in one
nightwhy all you got to do is LOOK at it Youd think we neednt
ever trouble to make it better Thats what the devil wants us to
dowants us to rest easy about it and paints it up to look like a
heaven of peace and purity and sanctified spirits Snowfall like this
would of made Lot turn the angel outofdoors and say that the old home
was good enough for him Gomorrah would of looked like a Puritan
villagethough Ill bet my last dollar that there was a lot and a
WHOLE lot thats never been told about Puritan villages A lot that

WHAT never was interrupted Mr Peter Bradbury whose granddaughter
had lately announced her discovery that the Bradburys were descended
from Miles Standish What wasnt told about Puritan villages

Cant you wait Mr Arps accents were those of pain Havent I got
ANY right to present my side of the case Aint we restrained enough
to allow of free speech here How can we ever git anywhere in an
argument like this unless we let one man talk at a time How

Go on with your statement said Uncle Joe Davey impatiently

Mr Arps grievance was increased Now listen to YOU How many more
interruptions are comin Ill listen to the other side but Ive got
to state mine first havent I If I dont make my point clear whats
the use of the argument Argumentation is only the comparison of two
sides of a question and you have to see what the first side IS before
you can compare it with the other one dont you Are you all agreed
to that

Yes yes said the Colonel Go ahead We wont interrupt until
youre through

Very well resumed Mr Arp with a fleeting expression of
satisfaction as I said before I wish toas I said He paused in
some confusion As I said argumentation isthat is I say He
stopped again utterly at sea having talked himself so far out of his
course that he was unable to recall either his sailing port or his
destination Finally he said feebly to save the confession Well
go on with your side of it

This generosity was for a moment disconcerting however the quietest
of the party took up the oppositionRoger Tabor a very thin old man
with a cleanshaven face almost as white as his hair and melancholy
gentle gray eyes very unlike those of his brother Jonas which were
dark and sharp and buttonbright It was to Rogers son that Jonas
had so magnificently sold the hardware business Roger was known in
Canaan as the artist there had never been another of his profession
in the place and the town knew not the word painter except in
application to the useful artisan who is subject to leadpoisoning
There was no indication of his profession in the attire of Mr Tabor
unless the too apparent age of his black felt hat and a neat patch at
the elbow of his shiny old brown overcoat might have been taken as
symbols of the sacrifice to his muse which his life had been He was
not a constant attendant of the conclave and when he came it was
usually to listen indeed he spoke so seldom that at the sound of his
voice they all turned to him with some surprise

I suppose he began that Eskew means the devil is behind all
beautiful things

Ugly ones too said Mr Arp with a start of recollection And I
wish to state

Not now Colonel Flitcroft turned upon him violently Youve
already stated it

Then if he is behind the ugly things too said Roger we must take
him either way so let us be glad of the beauty for its own sake
Eskew says this is a wicked town It may beI dont know He says
its badly built perhaps it is but it doesnt seem to me that its
ugly in itself I dont know what its real self is because it wears
so many aspects God keeps painting it all the time and never shows
me twice the same picture not even two snowfalls are just alike nor
the days that follow them no more than two misty sunsets are
alikefor the color and even the form of the town you call ugly are a
matter of the season of the year and of the time of day and of the
light and air The ugly town is like an endless gallery which you can
walk through from yearend to yearend never seeing the same canvas
twice no matter how much you may want toand theres the pathos of
it Isnt it the same with people with the characters of all of us
just as it is with our faces No face remains the same for two
successive days

It dont Colonel Flitcroft interrupted with an explosive and rueful
incredulity Well Id like to Second thoughts came to him almost
immediately and as much out of gallantry as through discretion
fearing that he might be taken as thinking of one at home he relapsed
into silence

Not so with the others It was as if a firecracker had been dropped
into a sleeping poultryyard Least of all could Mr Arp contain
himself At the top of his voice necessarily he agreed with Roger
that faces changed not only from day to day and not only because of
light and air and such things but from hour to hour and from minute
to minute through the hideous stimulus of hypocrisy

The argument grew heated half a dozen tidy quarrels arose all the
sages went at it fiercely except Roger Tabor who stole quietly away
The aged men were enjoying themselves thoroughly especially those who
quarrelled Naturally the frail bark of the topic which had been
launched was whirled about by too many sidecurrents to remain long in
sight and soon became derelict while the intellectual dolphins dove
and tumbled in the depths At the end of twenty minutes Mr Arp
emerged upon the surface and in his mouth was this

Tell me why aint the Churchwhy aint the Church and the rest of
the believers in a future life lookin for immortality at the other end
of life too If were immortal we always have been then why dont
they ever speculate on what we were before we were born Its because
theyre too blame selfishdont care a flapdoodle about what WAS all
they want is to go on livin forever

Mr Arps voice had risen to an acrid triumphancy when it suddenly
faltered relapsed to a murmur and then to a stricken silence as a
tall fat man of overpowering aspect threw open the outer door near by
and crossed the lobby to the clerks desk An awe fell upon the sages
with this advent They were hushed and after a movement in their
chairs with a strange effect of huddling sat disconcerted and
attentive like schoolboys at the entrance of the master

The personage had a big fat pink face and a heavily undershot jaw
what whitish beard he wore following his double chin somewhat after the
manner displayed in the portraits of Henry the Eighth His eyes very
bright under puffed upper lids were intolerant and insultingly
penetrating despite their small size Their irritability held a kind
of hotness and yet the personage exuded frost not of the weather all
about him You could not imagine man or angel daring to greet this
being geniallysooner throw a kiss to Mount Pilatus

Mr Brown he said with ponderous hostility in a bull bass to the
clerkthe kind of voice which would have made an express train leave
the track and go round the other waydo you hear me

Oh yes Judge the clerk replied swiftly in tones as unlike those
which he used for strange transients as a collectors voice in his
ladyloves ear is unlike that which he propels at delinquents

Do you see that snow asked the personage threateningly

Yes Judge Mr Brown essayed a placating smile Yes indeed
Judge Pike

Has your employer the manager of this hotel seen that snow pursued
the personage with a gesture of unspeakable solemn menace

Yes sir I think so Yes sir

Do you think he fully understands that I am the proprietor of this
building

Certainly Judge cer

You will inform him that I do not intend to be discommoded by his
negligence as I pass to my offices Tell him from me that unless he
keeps the sidewalks in front of this hotel clear of snow I will cancel
his lease Their present condition is outrageous Do you understand
me Outrageous Do you hear

Yes Judge I do so answered the clerk hoarse with respect Ill
see to it this minute Judge Pike

You had better The personage turned himself about and began a grim
progress towards the door by which he had entered his eyes fixing
themselves angrily upon the conclave at the windows

Colonel Flitcroft essayed a smile a faltering one

Fine weather Judge Pike he said hopefully

There was no response of any kind the undershot jaw became more
intolerant The personage made his opinion of the group
disconcertingly plain and the old boys understood that he knew them
for a worthless lot of senile loafers as great a nuisance in his
building as was the snow without and much too evident was his unspoken
threat to see that the manager cleared them out of there before long

He nodded curtly to the only man of substance among them Jonas Tabor
and shut the door behind him with majestic insult He was Canaans
millionaire

He was one of those dynamic creatures who leave the haunting impression
of their wills behind them like the tails of BoPeeps sheep like the
evil dead men have done he left his intolerant image in the ether for
a long time after he had gone to confront and confound the aged men
and hold them in deferential and humiliated silence Each of them was
mysteriously lowered in his own estimation and knew that he had been
made to seem futile and foolish in the eyes of his fellows They were
all conscious too that the clerk had been acutely receptive of Judge
Pikes reading of them that he was reviving from his own squelchedness
through the later snubbing of the colonel also that he might further
seek to recover his poise by an attack on them for cluttering up the
office

Naturally Jonas Tabor was the first to speak Judge Pikes lookin
mighty well he said admiringly

Yes he is ventured Squire Buckalew with deference mighty well

Yes sir echoed Peter Bradbury mighty well

Hes a great man wheezed Uncle Joe Davey a great man Judge Martin
Pike a great man

I expect he has considerable on his mind said the Colonel who had
grown very red I noticed that he hardly seemed to see us

Yes sir Mr Bradbury corroborated with an attempt at an amused
laugh I noticed it too Of course a man with all his cares and
interests must git absentminded now and then

Of course he does said the colonel A man with all his
responsibilities

Yes thats so came a chorus of the brethren finding comfort and
reassurance as their voices and spirits began to recover from the
blight

Theres a party at the Judges tonight said Mr Bradburykind of
a ball Mamie Pikes givin for the young folks Quite a doins I
hear

Thats another thing thats ruining Canaan Mr Arp declared
morosely These entertainments they have nowadays Spend all the
money out of townband from Indianapolis chicken salad and darkey
waiters from Chicago And what I want to know is Whats this town
goin to do about the nigger question

What about it asked Mr Davey belligerently

What about it Mr Arp mocked fiercely You better say What about
it

Well what maintained Mr Davey steadfastly

Ill bet there aint any less than four thousand niggers in Canaan
today Mr Arp hammered the floor with his stick Every last one of
em criminals and more comin on every train

No such a thing said Squire Buckalew living up to his bounden duty
You look down the street Theres the tenfortyfive comin in now
Ill bet you a straight fivecent PeekaBoo cigar there aint ary
nigger on the whole train except the sleepincar porters

What kind of a way to argue is that demanded Mr Arp hotly
Bettin aint proof is it Besides thats the through express from
the East I meant trains from the South

You didnt say so retorted Buckalew triumphantly Stick to your
bet Eskew stick to your bet

My bet cried the outraged Eskew Who offered to bet

You did replied the Squire with perfect assurance and sincerity
The others supported him in the heartiest spirit of onwiththedance
and war and joy were unconfined

A decrepit hack or two a couple of oldfashioned surreys and a few
cutunders drove by bearing the newly arrived and their valises the
hotel omnibus depositing several commercial travellers at the door A
solitary figure came from the station on foot and when it appeared
within fair range of the window Uncle Joe Davey who had but hovered
on the flanks of the combat first removed his spectacles and wiped
them as though distrusting the vision they offered him then
replacing them scanned anew the approaching figure and uttered a
smothered cry

My Lord Amighty he gasped Whats this Look there

They looked A truce came involuntarily and they sat in paralytic
silence as the figure made its stately and sensational progress along
Main Street

Not only the aged men were smitten Men shovelling snow from the
pavements stopped suddenly in their labors two women talking busily
on a doorstep were stilled and remained in frozen attitudes as it
passed a grocers clerk crossing the pavement carrying a heavily
laden basket to his delivery wagon halted halfway as the figure came
near and then making a pivot of his heels as it went by behaved
towards it as does the magnetic needle to the pole

It was that of a tall gentleman cheerfully though somewhat with
ennui enduring his nineteenth winter His long and slender face he
wore smiling beneath an accurately cut plaster of dark hair cornicing
his forehead a fashion followed by many youths of that year This
perfect bang was shown under a round black hat whose rim was so small
as almost not to be there at all and the head was supported by a
waxywhite seawall of collar rising three inches above the blue
billows of a puffed cravat upon which floated a large hollow pearl
His ulster sporting a big cape at the shoulders and a tasselled hood
over the cape was of a rough Scotch cloth patterned in faint
grayandwhite squares the size of baggagechecks and it was so long
that the skirts trailed in the snow His legs were lost in the
accurately creased voluminous garments that were the tailors canny
reaction from the tight trousers with which the Eighties had begun
they were in color a palish russet broadly striped with gray and
in size surpassed the milder spirit of fashion so far as they
permitted a liberal knee action to take place almost without
superficial effect Upon his feet glistened long shoes shaped save
for the heels like sharp racingshells these were partially protected
by tancolored low gaiters with flat shiny brown buttons In one
hand the youth swung a bonehandled walkingstick perhaps an inch and
a half in diameter the other carried a yellow leather banjocase upon
the outer side of which glittered the embossedsilver initials E B
He was smoking but walked with his head up making use however of a
gait at that time new to Canaan a seeming superbly irresponsible
lounge engendering much motion of the shoulders producing an effect
of carelessness combined with independencean effect which the
innocent have been known to hail as an unconscious one

He looked about him as he came smilingly with an expression of
princely amusementas an elderly cabinet minister say strolling
about a village where he had spent some months in his youth a hamlet
which he had then thought large and imposing but which being
revisited after years of cosmopolitan glory appeals to his whimsy and
his pity The youths glance at the courthouse unmistakably said
Ah I recall that odd little box I thought it quite large in the days
before I became what I am now and I dare say the good townsfolk still
think it an imposing structure With everything in sight he deigned to
be amused especially with the old faces in the National House
windows To these he waved his stick with airy graciousness

My soul said Mr Davey It seems to know some of us

Yes agreed Mr Arp his voice recovered and _I_ know IT

You do exclaimed the Colonel

I do and so do you Its Fanny Loudens boy Gene come home for
his Christmas holidays

By George youre right cried Flitcroft I recognize him now

But whats the matter with him asked Mr Bradbury eagerly Has he
joined some patentmedicine troupe

Not a bit replied Eskew He went East to college last fall

Do they MAKE the boys wear them clothes persisted Bradbury Is it
some kind of uniform

I dont care what it is said Jonas Tabor If I was Henry Louden I
wouldnt let him wear em around here

Oh you wouldnt wouldnt you Jonas Mr Arp employed the accents
of sarcasm Id like to see Henry Louden try to interfere with Gene
Bantry Fannyd lock the old fool up in the cellar

The lofty vision lurched out of view

I reckon said the Colonel leaning forward to see the last of itI
reckon Henry Loudens about the saddest case of abused stepfather I
ever saw

Its his own fault said Mr Arptwice not havin sense enough not
to marry Him with a son of his own too

Yes assented the Colonel marryin a widow with a son of her own
and that widow Fanny

Wasnt it just the same with her first husbandBantry Mr Davey
asked not for information as he immediately answered himself You
bet it was Didnt she always rule the roost Yes she did She made
a god of Gene from the day he was born Bantrys house was run for
him like Loudens is now

And look exclaimed Mr Arp with satisfaction at the way hes
turned out

He aint turned out at all yet hes too young said Buckalew
Besides clothes dont make the man

Wasnt he smokin a cigareet cried Eskew triumphantly This was
final

Its a pity Henry Louden cant do something for his own son said Mr
Bradbury Why dont he send him away to college

Fanny wont let him chuckled Mr Arp malevolently Takes all
their spare change to keep Gene there in style I dont blame her
Gene certainly acts the fool but that Joe Louden is the orneriest boy
I ever saw in an ornery worldfull

He always was kind of misCHEEvous admitted Buckalew I dont think
hes mean though and it does seem kind of not just right that Joes
fathers moneyBantry didnt leave anything to speak ofhas to go to
keepin Gene on the fat of the land with Joe gittin up at halfpast
four to carry papers and him goin on nineteen years old

Its all hes fit for exclaimed Eskew Hes low down I tell ye
Aint it only last week Judge Pike caught him shootin craps with
Pikes nigger driver and some other nigger hiredmen in the alley back
of Pikes barn

Mr Schindlinger the retired grocer one of the silent members
corroborated Eskews information I heert dot too he gave forth in
his fat voice He blays dominoes pooty often in der room back off
Louie Farbachs tsaloon I see him myself Pooty often Blayin fer a
leedle moneymit loafers Loafers

Pretty outlook for the Loudens said Eskew Arp much pleased One
boy a plum fool and dressed like it the other gone to the dogs
already

What could you expect Joe to be retorted Squire Buckalew What
chance has he ever had Long as I can remember Fannys made him fetch
and carry for Gene Genes had everythingall the fancy clothes
all the pocketmoney and now college

You ever hear that boy Joe talk politics asked Uncle Joe Davey
crossing a cough with a chuckle His heads so full of schemes fer
running this town and state too its a wonder it dont bust Henry
Louden told me hes see Joe set around and study by the hour how to
save three million dollars for the state in two years

And the best he can do for himself added Eskew is deliverin the
Daily Tocsin on a secondhand Star bicycle and gamblin with niggers
and riffraff None of the nice young folks invite him to their doins
any more

Thats because hes got so shabby hes quit goin with em said
Buckalew

No it aint snapped Mr Arp Its because hes so low down Hes
no more n a town outcast There aint ary one of the girls ll have a
thing to do with him except that riprarin tomboy next door to
Loudens and the others dont have much to do with HER neither I can
tell ye That Arie Tabor

Colonel Flitcroft caught him surreptitiously by the arm SH Eskew
he whispered Look out what youre sayin

You neednt mind me Jonas Tabor spoke up crisply I washed my
hands of all responsibility for Rogers branch of the family long ago
Never was one of em had the energy or brains to make a decent livin
beginning with Roger not one worth his salt I set Rogers son up in
business and all the return he ever made me was to go into bankruptcy
and take to drink till he died a sot like his wife did of shame I
done all I could when I handed him over my store and I never expect to
lift a finger for em again Ariel Tabors my grandniece but she
didnt act like it and you can say anything you like about her for
what I care The last time I spoke to her was a year and a half ago
and I dont reckon Ill ever trouble to again

How was that Jonas quickly inquired Mr Davey who being the
eldest of the party was the most curious What happened

She was out in the street up on that high bicycle of Joe Loudens
He was teachin her to ride and she was sittin on it like a man does
I stopped and told her she wasnt respectable Sixteen years old goin
on seventeen

What did she say

Laughed said Jonas his voice becoming louder as the recital of his
wrongs renewed their sting in his soul Laughed

What did you do

I went up to her and told her she wasnt a decent girl and shook the
wheel Mr Tabor illustrated by seizing the lapels of Joe Davey and
shaking him I told her if her grandfather had any spunk shed git an
oldfashioned hidin for behavin that way And I shook the wheel
again Here Mr Tabor forgetting in the wrath incited by the
recollection that he had not to do with an inanimate object swung the
gasping and helpless Mr Davey rapidly back and forth in his chair I
shook it good and hard

What did she do then asked Peter Bradbury

Fell off on me replied Jonas violently On purpose

I wisht shed killed ye said Mr Davey in a choking voice as
released he sank back in his chair

On purpose repeated Jonas And smashed a straw hat I hadnt had
three months All to pieces So it couldnt be fixed

And what then pursued Bradbury

SHE ran replied Jonas bitterlyran And Joe LoudenJoe
Louden He paused and gulped

What did he do Peter leaned forward in his chair eagerly

The narrator of the outrage gulped again and opened and shut his mouth
before responding

He said if I didnt pay for a broken spoke on his wheel hed have to
sue me

No one inquired if Jonas had paid and Jonas said no more The
recollection of his wrongs together with the illustrative violence
offered to Mr Davey had been too much for him He sank back
panting in his chair his hands fluttering nervously over his heart
and closed his eyes

I wonder why ruminated Mr BradburyI wonder why Gene Bantry
walked up from the deepo Dont seem much like his style Should
think hed of rode up in a hack

Sho said Uncle Joe Davey his breath recovered He wanted to walk
up past Judge Pikes to see if there wasnt a show of Mamies bein at
the window and give her a chance to look at that college uniform and
banjobox and new walk of his

Mr Arp began to show signs of uneasiness

Id like mighty well to know he said shifting round in his chair
if theres anybody here thats been able to answer the question I PUT
yesterday just before we went home You all tried to but I didnt
hear anything I could consider anyways near even a fair argument

Who tried to asked Buckalew sharply sitting up straight What
question

What proof can you bring me began Mr Arp deliberately that we
folks modernly aint more degenerate than the ancient Romans



II

A RESCUE

Main Street already muffled by the snow added to its quietude a
frozen hush where the wonderbearing youth pursued his course along its
white straight way None was there in whom impertinence overmastered
astonishment or who recovered from the sight in time to jeer with
effect no Trabs boy gathered courage to enact in the thoroughfare a
scene of mockery and of joy Leaving business at a temporary
standstill behind him Mr Bantry swept his long coat steadily over
the snow and soon emerged upon that part of the street where the mart
gave way to the home The comfortable houses stood pleasantly back
from the street with plenty of lawn and shrubbery about them and
often along the picketfences the laden branches of small cedars
bending low with their burden showered the young mans swinging
shoulders glitteringly as he brushed by

And now that expression he worethe indulgent amusement of a man of
the worldbegan to disintegrate and show signs of change It became
finely grave as of a high conventionality lofty assured and
mannered as he approached the Pike mansion The remotest stranger
must at once perceive that the Canaan papers could not have called it
otherwise without pain

It was a big smoothstonefaced house product of the Seventies
frowning under an outrageously insistent mansard capped by a cupola
and staring out of long windows overtopped with ornamental slabs
Two castiron deer painted deathgray twins of the same mould stood
on opposite sides of the front walk their backs towards it and each
other their bodies in profile to the street their necks bent
however so that they gazed upon the passerbyyet gazed without
emotion Two large calm dogs guarded the top of the steps leading to
the frontdoor they also were twins and of the same interesting metal
though honored beyond the deer by coats of black paint and shellac It
was to be remarked that these dogs were of no distinguishable species
or breed yet they were unmistakably dogs the dullest must have
recognized them as such at a glance which was perhaps enough It
was a hideous house importantlooking cold yet harshly aggressive a
house whose exterior provoked a shuddering guess of the brass
lambrequins and plush fringes within a solid house obviouslynay
blatantlythe residence of the principal citizen whom it had grown to
resemble as is the impish habit of houses and it sat in the middle of
its flat acre of snowy lawn like a rich fat man enraged and sitting
straight up in bed to swear

And yet there was one charming thing about this ugly house Some
workmen were enclosing a large side porch with heavy canvas evidently
for festal purposes Looking out from between two strips of the canvas
was the rosy and delicate face of a pretty girl smiling upon Eugene
Bantry as he passed It was an obviously pretty face all the youth
and prettiness there for your very first glance elaborately pretty
like the splendid profusion of hair about and above itambercolored
hair upon which so much time had been spent that a circle of large
round curls rose above the mass of it like golden bubbles tipping a
coronet

The girls fingers were pressed thoughtfully against her chin as Eugene
strode into view immediately her eyes widened and brightened He
swung along the fence with the handsomest appearance of
unconsciousness until he reached a point nearly opposite her Then he
turned his head as if haphazardly and met her eyes At once she
threw out her hand towards him waving him a greetinga gesture which
as her fingers had been near her lips was a little like throwing a
kiss He crooked an elbow and with a onetwothree military movement
removed his smallbrimmed hat extended it to full armslength at the
shoulderlevel returned it to his head with LifeGuard precision This
was also new to Canaan He was letting Mamie Pike have it all at once

The impression was as large as he could have desired She remained at
the opening in the canvas and watched him until he wagged his shoulders
round the next corner and disappeared into a cross street As for
Eugene he was calm with a great calm and very red

He had not covered a great distance however before his gravity was
replaced by his former smiling look of the landed gentleman amused by
the innocent pastimes of the peasants though there was no one in sight
except a woman sweeping some snow from the front steps of a cottage
and she not perceiving him retired indoors without knowing her loss
He had come to a thinly built part of the town the perfect quiet of
which made the sound he heard as he opened the picket gate of his own
home all the more startling It was a screamloud frantic and
terrorstricken

Eugene stopped with the gate half open

Out of the winter skeleton of a grapearbor at one side of the
foursquare brick house a brownfaced girl of seventeen precipitated
herself through the air in the midst of a shower of torn cardboard
which she threw before her as she leaped She lit upon her toes and
headed for the gate at top speed pursued by a pale young man whose
thin arms strove spasmodically to reach her Scattering snow behind
them hair flying the pair sped on like two tattered branches before a
high wind for as they came nearer Eugene of whom in the tensity of
their flight they took no note it was to be seen that both were so
shabbily dressed as to be almost ragged There was a brown patch upon
the girls faded skirt at the knee the shortness of the garment
indicating its age to be something over three years as well as
permitting the knowledge to become more general than befitting that her
cotton stockings had been clumsily darned in several places Her
pursuer was in as evil case his trousers displayed a tendency to
fringedness at pocket and heel his coat blowing open as he ran threw
pennants of torn lining to the breeze and made it too plain that there
were but three buttons on his waistcoat

The girl ran beautifully but a fleeter foot was behind her and though
she dodged and evaded like a creature of the woods the reaching hand
fell upon the loose sleeve of her red blouse nor fell lightly She
gave a wrench of frenzy the antique fabric refused the strain parted
at the shoulder seam so thoroughly that the whole sleeve came awaybut
not to its owners release for she had been brought round by the jerk
so that agile as she had shown herself the pursuer threw an arm about
her neck before she could twist away and held her

There was a sharp struggle as short as it was fierce Neither of
these extraordinary wrestlers spoke They fought Victory hung in the
balance for perhaps four seconds then the girl was thrown heavily upon
her back in such a turmoil of snow that she seemed to be the mere
nucleus of a white comet She struggled to get up plying knee and
elbow with a very anguish of determination but her opponent held her
pinioned both her wrists with one hand and with the other rubbed great
handfuls of snow into her face sparing neither mouth nor eyes

You will he cried You will tear up my pictures A dirty trick
and you get washed for it

Half suffocated choking gasping she still fought on squirming and
kicking with such spirit that the pair of them appeared to the beholder
like figures of mist writhing in a fountain of snow

More violence was to mar the peace of morning Unexpectedly attacked
from the rear the conqueror was seized by the nape of the neck and one
wrist and jerked to his feet simultaneously receiving a succession of
kicks from his assailant Prompted by an entirely natural curiosity he
essayed to turn his head to see who this might be but a twist of his
forearm and the pressure of strong fingers under his ear constrained
him to remain as he was therefore abandoning resistance and oddly
enough accepting without comment the indication that his captor
desired to remain for the moment incognito he resorted calmly to
explanations

She tore up a picture of mine he said receiving the punishment
without apparent emotion She seemed to think because shed drawn it
herself she had a right to

There was a slight whimsical droop at the corner of his mouth as he
spoke which might have been thought characteristic of him He was an
oddlooking boy not illmade though very thin and not tall His
pallor was clear and even as though constitutional the features were
delicate almost childlike but they were very slightly distorted
through nervous habit to an expression at once wistful and humorous
one eyebrow was a shade higher than the other one side of the mouth
slightly drawn down the eyelids twitched a little habitually the
fine blue eyes themselves were almost comically reproachfulthe look
of a puppy who thinks you would not have beaten him if you had known
what was in his heart All of this was in the quality of his voice
too as he said to his invisible captor with an air of detachment from
any personal feeling

What peculiar shoes you wear I dont think I ever felt any so
pointed before

The rescuing knight took no thought of offering to help the persecuted
damsel to arise instead he tightened his grip upon the prisoners
neck until perforce waternot tearsstarted from the latters eyes

You miserable little muff said the conqueror what the devil do you
mean making this scene on our front lawn

Why its Eugene exclaimed the helpless one They didnt expect you
till tonight When did you get in

Just in time to give you a lesson my buck replied Bantry grimly
In GOOD time for that my playful stepbrother

He began to twist the others wrista treatment of bone and ligament
in the application of which schoolboys and even freshmen are often
adept Eugene made the torture acute and was apparently enjoying the
work when suddenlywithout any manner of warninghe received an
astounding blow upon the left ear which half stunned him for the
moment and sent his hat flying and himself reeling so great was the
surprise and shock of it It was not a slap not an openhanded push
nothing like it but a fierce welldelivered blow from a clinched fist
with the shoulder behind it and it was the girl who had given it

Dont you dare to touch Joe she cried passionately Dont you lay
a finger on him

Furious and red he staggered round to look at her

You wretched little wildcat what do you mean by that he broke out

Dont you touch Joe she panted Dont you Her breath caught
and there was a break in her voice as she faced him She could not
finish the repetition of that cry Dont you touch Joe

But there was no break in the spirit that passion of protection which
had dealt the blow Both boys looked at her something aghast

She stood before them trembling with rage and shivering with cold in
the sudden wind which had come up Her hair had fallen and blew across
her streaming face in brown witchwisps one of the illdarned
stockings had come down and hung about her shoe in folds full of snow
the arm which had lost its sleeve was bare and wet thin as the arm of
a growing boy it shook convulsively and was red from shoulder to
clinched fist She was covered with snow Mists of white drift blew
across her mercifully half veiling her

Eugene recovered himself He swung round upon his heel restored his
hat to his head with precision picked up his stick and touched his
banjocase with it

Carry that into the house he said indifferently to his
stepbrother

Dont you do it said the girl hotly between her chattering teeth

Eugene turned towards her wearing the sharp edge of a smile Not
removing his eyes from her face he produced with deliberation a flat
silver box from a pocket took therefrom a cigarette replaced the box
extracted a smaller silver box from another pocket shook out of it a
fusee slowly lit the cigarettethis in a splendid silence which he
finally broke to say languidly but with particular distinctness

Ariel Tabor go home

The girls teeth stopped chattering her lips remaining parted she
shook the hair out of her eyes and stared at him as if she did not
understand but Joe Louden who had picked up the banjocase
obediently burst into cheerful laughter

Thats it Gene he cried gayly Thats the way to talk to her

Stow it you young cub replied Eugene not turning to him Do you
think Im trying to be amusing

I dont know what you mean by stow it Joe began but if

I mean interrupted the other not relaxing his faintly smiling stare
at the girlI mean that Ariel Tabor is to go home Really we cant
have this kind of thing occurring upon our front lawn

The flush upon her wet cheeks deepened and became dark even her arm
grew redder as she gazed back at him In his eyes was patent his
complete realization of the figure she cut of this bare arm of the
strewn hair of the fallen stocking of the ragged shoulder of her
blouse of her patched short skirt of the whole dishevelled little
figure He was the master of the house and he was sending her home as
illbehaved children are sent home by neighbors

The immobile amused superiority of this proprietor of silver boxes
this wearer of strange and brilliant garments became slightly
intensified as he pointed to the fallen sleeve a rag of red and snow
lying near her feet

You might take that with you he said interrogatively

Her gaze had not wavered in meeting his but at this her eyelashes
began to wink uncontrollably her chin to tremble She bent over the
sleeve and picked it up before Joe Louden who had started towards
her could do it for her Then turning her head still bent so that
her face was hidden from both of them she ran out of the gate

DO go Joe called after her vehemently Go Just to show what a
fool you are to think Genes in earnest

He would have followed but his stepbrother caught him by the arm
Dont stop her said Eugene Cant you tell when I AM in earnest
you bally muff

I know you are returned the other in a low voice I didnt want
her to think so for your sake

Thousands of thanks said Eugene airily You are a wise young
judge She couldnt stayin THAT state could she I sent her for
her own good

She could have gone in the house and your mother might have loaned her
a jacket returned Joe swallowing You had no business to make her
go out in the street like that

Eugene laughed There isnt a soul in sightand there shes all
right now Shes home

Ariel had run along the fence until she came to the next gate which
opened upon a walk leading to a shabby meandering old house of one
story with a very long low porch once painted white running the
full length of the front Ariel sprang upon the porch and disappeared
within the house

Joe stood looking after her his eyelashes winking as had hers You
oughtnt to have treated her that way he said huskily

Eugene laughed again How were YOU treating her when I came up You
bully her all you want to yourself but nobody else must say even a
fatherly word to her

That wasnt bullying explained Joe We fight all the time

Mais oui assented Eugene I fancy

What said the other blankly

Pick up that banjocase again and come on commanded Mr Bantry
tartly Wheres the mater

Joe stared at him Wheres what

The mater was the frowning reply

Oh yes I know said Joe looking at his stepbrother curiously
Ive seen it in stories Shes upstairs Youll be a surprise
Youre wearing lots of clothes Gene

I suppose it will seem so to Canaan returned the other weariedly
Governor feeling fit

I never saw him Joe replied then caught himself Oh I see what
you mean Yes hes all right

They had come into the hall and Eugene was removing the long coat
while his stepbrother looked at him thoughtfully

Gene asked the latter in a softened voice have you seen Mamie
Pike yet

You will find my young friend responded Mr Bantry if you ever go
about much outside of Canaan that ladies names are not supposed to be
mentioned indiscriminately

Its only said Joe that I wanted to say that theres a dance at
their house tonight I suppose youll be going

Certainly Are you

Both knew that the question was needless but Joe answered gently

Oh no of course not He leaned over and fumbled with one foot as if
to fasten a loose shoestring She wouldnt be very likely to ask me

Well what about it

Only thatthat Arie Tabors going

Indeed Eugene paused on the stairs which he had begun to ascend
Very interesting

I thought continued Joe hopefully straightening up to look at him
that maybe youd dance with her I dont believe many will ask
herIm afraid they wontand if you would even only once it would
kind of make up forhe falteredfor out there he finished
nodding his head in the direction of the gate

If Eugene vouchsafed any reply it was lost in a loud shrill cry from
above as a small intensely nervouslooking woman in blue silk ran
halfway down the stairs to meet him and caught him tearfully in her
arms

Dear old mater said Eugene

Joe went out of the frontdoor quickly



III

OLD HOPES

The door which Ariel had entered opened upon a narrow hall and down
this she ran to her own room passing with face averted the entrance
to the broad lowceilinged chamber that had served Roger Tabor as a
studio for almost fifty years He was sitting there now in a hopeless
and disconsolate attitude with his back towards the double doors
which were open and had been open since their hinges had begun to give
way when Ariel was a child Hearing her step he called her name but
did not turn and receiving no answer sighed faintly as he heard her
own door close upon her

Then as his eyes wandered about the many canvases which leaned against
the dingy walls he sighed again Usually they showed their brown
backs but today he had turned them all to face outward Twilight
sunset moonlight the Courthouse in moonlight dawn morning noon
Main Street at noon high summer first spring red autumn
midwinter all were thereillimitably detailed worked to a smoothness
like a glaze and all lovingly done with unthinkable labor

And there were Italian FlowerSellers damsels with careful hair two
figures together one blonde the other as brunette as lampblack the
blondein pink satin and blue slippersleaning against a pillar and
smiling over the golden coins for which she had exchanged her posies
the brunette seated at her feet weeping upon an unsold bouquet There
were redsashed Fisher Lads wading with butterflynets on their
shoulders there was a Tying the Ribbon on Pussys Neck there were
portraits in oil and petrifactions in crayon as hard and tight as the
purses of those who had refused to accept them leaving them upon their
makers hands because the likeness had failed

After a time the old man got up went to his easel near a window and
sighing again began patiently to work upon one of these failuresa
portrait in oil of a savage old lady which he was doing from a
photograph The expression of the mouth and the shape of the nose had
not pleased her descendants and the beneficiaries under the will and
it was upon the images of these features that Roger labored He leaned
far forward with his face close to the canvas holding his brushes
after the Spencerian fashion working steadily through the afternoon
and when the light grew dimmer leaning closer to his canvas to see
When it had become almost dark in the room he lit a studentlamp with
a greenglass shade and placing it upon a table beside him continued
to paint Ariels voice interrupted him at last

Its quittingtime grandfather she called gently from the doorway
behind him

He sank back in his chair conscious for the first time of how tired
he had grown I suppose so he said though it seemed to me that I
was just getting my hand in His eyes brightened for a moment I
declare I believe Ive caught it a great deal better Come and look
Ariel Doesnt it seem to you that Im getting it Those pearly
shadows in the flesh

Im sure of it Those people ought to be very proud to have it She
came to him quietly took the palette and brushes from his hands and
began to clean them standing in the shadow behind him Its too good
for them

I wonder if it is he said slowly leaning forward and curving his
hands about his eyes so as to shut off everything from his view except
the canvas I wonder if it is he repeated Then his hands dropped
sadly in his lap and he sank back again with a patient kind of
revulsion No no it isnt I always think theyre good when Ive
just finished them Ive been fooled that way all my life They dont
look the same afterwards

Theyre always beautiful she said softly

Ah ah he sighed

Now Roger she cried with cheerful sharpness continuing her work

I know he said with a plaintive laughI know Sometimes I think
that all my reward has been in the few minutes Ive had just after
finishing them During those few minutes I seem to see in them all
that I wanted to put in them I see it because what Ive been trying to
express is still so warm in my own eyes that I seem to have got it on
the canvas where I wanted it

But you do she said You do get it there

No he murmured in return I never did I got out some of the old
ones when I came in this morning some that I hadnt looked at for
years and its the same with them You can do it much better
yourselfyour sketches show it

No no she protested quickly

Yes they do and I wondered if it was only because you were young
But those I did when I was young are almost the same as the ones I
paint now I havent learned much There hasnt been any one to show
me And you cant learn from print never Yet Ive grown in what I
SEEgrown so that the world is full of beauty to me that I never
dreamed of seeing when I began But I cant paint itI cant get it on
the canvas Ah I think I might have known how to if I hadnt had to
teach myself if I could only have seen how some of the other fellows
did their work If Id ever saved money to get away from Canaanif I
could have gone away from it and come back knowing how to paint itif
I could have got to Paris for just one month PARISfor just one
month

Perhaps we will you cant tell what MAY happen It was always her
reply to this cry of his

PARISfor just one month he repeated with infinite wistfulness
and then realizing what an old old cry it was with him he shook his
head impatiently sniffing out a laugh at himself rose and went
pottering about among the canvases returning their faces to the wall
and railing at them mutteringly

Whatever took me into it I dont know I might have done something
useful But I couldnt bring myself ever to consider doing anything
elseI couldnt bear even to think of it Lord forgive me I even
tried to encourage your father to paint Perhaps he might as well poor
boy as to have put all hed made into buying Jonas out Ah me There
you go FlowerGirls Turn your silly faces to the wall and smile
and cry there till Im gone and somebody throws you on a bonfire ILL
never look at you again He paused with the canvas half turned
And yet he went on reflectively a man promised me thirtyfive
dollars for that picture once I painted it to order but he went away
before I finished it and never answered the letters I wrote him about
it I wish I had the money nowperhaps we could have more than two
meals a day

We dont need more said Ariel scraping the palette attentively
Its healthier with only breakfast and supper I think Id rather
have a new dress than dinner

I dare say you would the old man mused Youre youngyoure young
What were you doing all this afternoon child

In my room trying to make over mammas weddingdress for tonight

Tonight

Mamie Pike invited me to a dance at their house

Very well Im glad youre going to be gay he said not seeing the
faintly bitter smile that came to her face

I dont think Ill be very gay she answered

I dont know why I gonobody ever asks me to dance

Why not he asked with an old mans astonishment

I dont know Perhaps its because I dont dress very well Then
as he made a sorrowful gesture she cut him off before he could speak
Oh it isnt altogether because were poor its more I dont know how
to wear what Ive got the way some girls do I never cared much
andwell IM not worrying Roger And I think Ive done a good deal
with mammas dress Its a very grand dress I wonder I never thought
of wearing it until today I may beshe laughed and blushedI may
be the belle of the ballwho knows

Youll want me to walk over with you and come for you afterwards I
expect

Only to take me It may be late when I come awayif a good many
SHOULD ask me to dance for once Of course I could come home alone
But Joe Louden is going to sort of hang around outside and hell meet
me at the gate and see me safe home

Oh he exclaimed blankly

Isnt it all right she asked

I think Id better come for you he answered gently The truth is
II think youd better not be with Joe Louden a great deal

Why

Well he doesnt seem a vicious boy to me but Im afraid hes getting
rather a bad name my dear

Hes not getting one she said gravely Hes already got one
Hes had a bad name in Canaan for a long while It grew in the first
place out of shabbiness and mischief but it did grow and if people
keep on giving him a bad name the time will come when hell live up to
it Hes not any worse than I am and I guess my own name isnt too
goodfor a girl And yet so far theres nothing against him except
his bad name

Im afraid there is said Roger It doesnt look very well for a
young man of his age to be doing no better than delivering papers

It gives him time to study law she answered quickly If he
clerked all day in a store he couldnt

I didnt know he was studying now I thought Id heard that he was in
a lawyers office for a few weeks last year and was turned out for
setting fire to it with a pipe

It was an accident she interposed

But some pretty important papers were burned and after that none of
the other lawyers would have him

Hes not in an office she admitted I didnt mean that But he
studies a great deal He goes to the courts all the time theyre in
session and hes bought some books of his own

Wellperhaps he assented but they say he gambles and drinks and
that last week Judge Pike threatened to have him arrested for throwing
dice with some negroes behind the Judges stable

What of it Im about the only nice person in town that will have
anything to do with himand nobody except you thinks IM very nice

Ariel Ariel

I know all about his gambling with darkies she continued excitedly
her voice rising and I know that he goes to saloons and that hes an
intimate friend of half the riffraff in town and I know the reason for
it too because hes told me He wants to know them to understand
them and he says some day theyll make him a power and then he can
help them

The old man laughed helplessly But I cant let him bring you home
my dear

She came to him slowly and laid her hands upon his shoulders
Grandfather and granddaughter were nearly of the same height and she
looked squarely into his eyes Then you must say it is because you
want to come for me not because I mustnt come with Joe

But I think it is a little because you mustnt come with Joe he
answered especially from the Pikes Dont you see that it mightnt
be well for Joe himself if the Judge should happen to see him I
understand he warned the boy to keep away from the neighborhood
entirely or he would have him locked up for dicethrowing The Judge
is a very influential man you know and as determined in matters like
this as he is irritable

Oh if you put it on that ground the girl replied her eyes
softening I think youd better come for me yourself

Very well I put it on that ground he returned smiling upon her

Then Ill send Joe word and get supper she said kissing him

It was the supperhour not only for them but everywhere in Canaan and
the cold air of the streets bore up and down and around corners the
smell of things frying The diningroom windows of all the houses
threw bright patches on the snow of the sideyards the windows of
other rooms except those of the kitchens were dark for the rule of
the place was Puritanical in thrift as in all things and the good
housekeepers disputed every record of the meters with unhappy
gascollectors

There was no better housekeeper in town than Mrs Louden nor a
thriftier but hers was one of the few houses in Canaan that evening
which showed bright lights in the front rooms while the family were at
supper It was proof of the agitation caused by the arrival of Eugene
that she forgot to turn out the gas in her parlor and in the chamber
she called a library on her way to the evening meal

That might not have been thought a cheerful feast for Joe Louden The
fatted calf was upon the board but it had not been provided for the
prodigal who in this case was the brother that stayed at home the
fete rewarded the good brother who had been in strange lands and the
good one had found much honor in his wanderings as he carelessly let
it appear Mrs Louden brightened inexpressibly whenever Eugene spoke
of himself and consequently she glowed most of the time Her
husbanda heavy melancholy silent man with a grizzled beard and no
mustachelowered at Joe throughout the meal but appeared to take a
strange comfort in his stepsons elegance and polish Eugene wore new
evening clothes and was lustrous to eye and ear

Joe escaped as soon as he could though not before the count of his
later sins had been set before Eugene in detail in mass and in all of
their depth breadth and thickness His father spoke but once after
nodding heavily to confirm all points of Mrs Loudens recital

You better use any influence youve got with your brother he said to
Eugene to make him come to time I cant do anything with him If
he gets in trouble he neednt come to me Ill never help him again
Im TIRED of it

Eugene glanced twinklingly at the outcast I didnt know he was such
a roarer as all that he said lightly not taking Joe as of enough
consequence to be treated as a sinner

This encouraged Mrs Louden to pathos upon the subject of her shame
before other women when Joe happened to be mentioned and the supper
was finished with the topic Joe slipped away through the kitchen
sneakingly and climbed the back fence In the alley he lit a cheap
cigarette and thrusting his hands into his pockets and shivering
violentlyfor he had no overcoatwalked away singing to himself A
Spanish cavalier stood in his retreat his teeth affording an
appropriate though involuntary castanet accompaniment

His movements throughout the earlier part of that evening are of
uncertain report It is known that he made a partial payment of
fortyfive cents at a secondhand bookstore for a number of
volumesGrindstaff on Torts and some otherswhich he had negotiated
on the instalment system it is also believed that he won twentyeight
cents playing sevenup in the little room behind Louie Farbachs bar
but these things are of little import compared to the established fact
that at eleven oclock he was one of the ball guests at the Pike
Mansion He took no active part in the festivities nor was he one of
the dancers his was on the contrary the role of a quiet observer
He lay stretched at full length upon the floor of the enclosed porch
one of the strips of canvas was later found to have been loosened
wedged between the outer railing and a row of palms in green tubs The
position he occupied was somewhat too draughty to have been recommended
by a physician but he commanded between the leaves of the screening
palms an excellent view of the room nearest the porch A long window
open afforded communication between this room one of those used for
dancing and the dim bower which had been made of the veranda whither
flirtatious couples made their way between the dances

It was not to play eavesdropper upon any of these that the uninvited
Joe had come He was not there to listen and it is possible that had
the curtains of other windows afforded him the chance to behold the
dance he might not have risked the dangers of his present position
He had not the slightest interest in the whispered coquetries that he
heard he watched only to catch now and then over the shoulders of the
dancers a fitful glimpse of a pretty head that flitted across the
windowthe amber hair of Mamie Pike He shivered in the draughts and
the floor of the porch was cement painful to elbow and knee the space
where he lay cramped and narrow but the golden bubbles of her hair
the shimmer of her dainty pink dress and the fluffy wave of her lace
scarf as she crossed and recrossed in a waltz left him apparently in
no discontent He watched with parted lips his pale cheeks reddening
whenever those fair glimpses were his At last she came out to the
veranda with Eugene and sat upon a little divan so close to Joe that
daring wildly in the shadow he reached out a trembling hand and let
his fingers rest upon the end of her scarf which had fallen from her
shoulders and touched the floor She sat with her back to him as did
Eugene

You have changed I think since last summer he heard her say
reflectively

For the worse ma cherie Joes expression might have been worth
seeing when Eugene said ma cherie for it was known in the Louden
household that Mr Bantry had failed to pass his examination in the
French language

No she answered But you have seen so much and accomplished so
much since then You have become so polished and so She paused and
then continued But perhaps Id better not say it you might be
offended

No I want you to say it he returned confidently and his
confidence was fully justified for she said

Well then I mean that you have become so thoroughly a man of the
world Now Ive said it You ARE offendedarent you

Not at all not at all replied Mr Bantry preventing by a masterful
effort his pleasure from showing in his face Though I suppose you
mean to imply that Im rather wicked

Oh no said Mamie with profound admiration not exactly wicked

University life IS fast nowadays Eugene admitted Its difficult
not to be drawn into it

And I suppose you look down on poor little Canaan now and everybody
in it

Oh no he laughed indulgently Not at all not at all I find it
very amusing

All of it

Not you he answered becoming very grave

HonestlyDONT you Her young voice trembled a little

Honestlyindeedtruly Eugene leaned very close to her and the
words were barely audible

You KNOW I dont

Then Imglad she whispered and Joe saw his stepbrother touch her
hand but she rose quickly Theres the music she cried happily
Its a waltz and its YOURS

Joe heard her little high heels tapping gayly towards the window
followed by the heavier tread of Eugene but he did not watch them go

He lay on his back with the hand that had touched Mamies scarf
pressed across his closed eyes

The music of that waltz was of the oldfashioned swingingly sorrowful
sort and it would be hard to say how long it was after that before the
boy could hear the air played without a recurrence of the bitterness of
that moment The rhythmical pathos of the violins was in such accord
with a faint sound of weeping which he heard near him presently that
for a little while he believed this sound to be part of the music and
part of himself Then it became more distinct and he raised himself
on one elbow to look about

Very close to him sitting upon the divan in the shadow was a girl
wearing a dress of beautiful silk She was crying softly her face in
her hands



IV

THE DISASTER

Ariel had worked all the afternoon over her mothers weddinggown and
two hours were required by her toilet for the dance She curled her
hair frizzily burning it here and there with a slatepencil heated
over a lamp chimney and she placed above one ear three or four large
artificial roses taken from an old hat of her mothers which she had
found in a trunk in the storeroom Possessing no slippers she
carefully blacked and polished her shoes which had been clumsily
resoled and fastened into the strings of each small rosettes of red
ribbon after which she practised swinging the train of her skirt until
she was proud of her manipulation of it She had no powder but found
in her grandfathers room a lump of magnesia that he was in the habit
of taking for heartburn and passed it over and over her brown face
and hands Then a lingering gaze into her small mirror gave her joy at
last she yearned so hard to see herself charming that she did see
herself so Admiration came and she told herself that she was more
attractive to look at than she had ever been in her life and that
perhaps at last she might begin to be sought for like other girls
The little glass showed a sort of prettiness in her thin unmatured
young face tripping dancetunes ran through her head her feet keeping
the timeah she did so hope to dance often that night
Perhapsperhaps she might be asked for every number And so wrapping
an old waterproof cloak about her she took her grandfathers arm and
sallied forth high hopes in her beating heart

It was in the dressingroom that the change began to come Alone at
home in her own ugly little room she had thought herself almost
beautiful but here in the brightly lighted chamber crowded with the
other girls it was different There was a big chevalglass at one end
of the room and she faced it when her turn camefor the mirror was
popularwith a sinking spirit There was the contrast like a picture
painted and framed The other girls all wore their hair after the
fashion introduced to Canaan by Mamie Pike the week before on her
return from a visit to Chicago None of them had crimped and none
had bedecked their tresses with artificial flowers Her alterations of
the weddingdress had not been successful the skirt was too short in
front and higher on one side than on the other showing too plainly the
heavysoled shoes which had lost most of their polish in the walk
through the snow The ribbon rosettes were fully revealed and as she
glanced at their reflection she heard the words LOOK AT THAT TRAIN
AND THOSE ROSETTES whispered behind her and saw in the mirror two
pretty young women turn away with their handkerchiefs over their mouths
and retreat hurriedly to an alcove All the feet in the room except
Ariels were in dainty kid or satin slippers of the color of the
dresses from which they glimmered out and only Ariel wore a train

She went away from the mirror and pretended to be busy with a hanging
thread in her sleeve

She was singularly an alien in the chattering room although she had
been born and lived all her life in the town Perhaps her position
among the young ladies may be best defined by the remark generally
current among them that evening to the effect that it was very sweet
of Mamie to invite her Ariel was not like the others she was not of
them and never had been Indeed she did not know them very well
Some of them nodded to her and gave her a word of greeting pleasantly
all of them whispered about her with wonder and suppressed amusement
but none talked to her They were not unkindly but they were young
and eager and excited over their own interestswhich were then in the
gentlemens dressingroom

Each of the other girls had been escorted by a youth of the place and
one by one joining these escorts in the hall outside the door they
descended the stairs until only Ariel was left She came down alone
after the first dance had begun and greeted her young hostesss mother
timidly Mrs Pikea small frightenedlooking woman with a prominent
ruby necklaceanswered her absently and hurried away to see that the
imported waiters did not steal anything

Ariel sat in one of the chairs against the wall and watched the dancers
with a smile of eager and benevolent interest In Canaan no parents
no guardians nor aunts were haled forth o nights to duenna the
junketings of youth Mrs Pike did not reappear and Ariel sat
conspicuously alone there was nothing else for her to do It was not
an easy matter

When the first dance reached an end Mamie Pike came to her for a
moment with a cheery welcome and was immediately surrounded by a
circle of young men and women flushed with dancing shouting as was
their wont laughing inexplicably over words and phrases and
unintelligible monosyllables as if they all belonged to a secret
society and these cries were symbols of things exquisitely humorous
which only they understood Ariel laughed with them more heartily than
any other so that she might seem to be of them and as merry as they
were but almost immediately she found herself outside of the circle
and presently they all whirled away into another dance and she was
left alone again

So she sat no one coming near her through several dances trying to
maintain the smile of delighted interest upon her face though she felt
the muscles of her face beginning to ache with their fixedness her
eyes growing hot and glazed All the other girls were provided with
partners for every dance with several young men left over these
latter lounging hilariously together in the doorways Ariel was careful
not to glance towards them but she could not help hating them Once
or twice between the dances she saw Miss Pike speak appealingly to one
of the superfluous glancing at the same time in her own direction
and Ariel could see too that the appeal proved unsuccessful until at
last Mamie approached her leading Norbert Flitcroft partly by the
hand partly by willpower Norbert was an excessively fat boy and at
the present moment looked as patient as the blind But he asked Ariel
if she was engaged for the next dance and Mamie having flitted
away stood disconsolately beside her waiting for the music to begin
Ariel was grateful for him

I think you must be very goodnatured Mr Flitcroft she said with
an air of raillery

No Im not he replied plaintively Everybody thinks I am because
Im fat and they expect me to do things they never dream of asking
anybody else to do Id like to see em even ASK Gene Bantry to go
and do some of the things they get me to do A person isnt
goodnatured just because hes fat he concluded morbidly but he
might as well be

Oh I meant goodnatured she returned with a sprightly laugh
because youre willing to waltz with me

Oh well he returned sighing thats all right

The orchestra flourished into La Paloma he put his arm mournfully
about her and taking her right hand with his left carried her arm out
to a rigid right angle beginning to pump and balance for time They
made three false starts and then got away Ariel danced badly she
hopped and lost the step but they persevered bumping against other
couples continually Circling breathlessly into the next room they
passed close to a long mirror in which Ariel saw herself although in
a flash more bitterly contrasted to the others than in the
chevalglass of the dressingroom The clump of roses was flopping
about her neck her crimped hair looked frowzy and there was something
terribly wrong about her dress Suddenly she felt her train to be
ominously grotesque as a thing following her in a nightmare

A moment later she caught her partner making a burlesque face of
suffering over her shoulder and turning her head quickly saw for
whose benefit he had constructed it Eugene Bantry flying expertly by
with Mamie was bestowing upon Mr Flitcroft a condescendingly
commiserative wink The next instant she tripped in her train and fell
to the floor at Eugenes feet carrying her partner with her

There was a shout of laughter The young hostess stopped Eugene who
would have gone on and he had no choice but to stoop to Ariels
assistance

It seems to be a habit of mine she said laughing loudly

She did not appear to see the hand he offered but got to her feet
without help and walked quickly away with Norbert who proceeded to
live up to the character he had given himself

Perhaps we had better not try it again she laughed

Well I should think not he returned with the frankest gloom With
the air of conducting her home he took her to the chair against the
wall whence he had brought her There his responsibility for her
seemed to cease Will you excuse me he asked and there was no
doubt that he felt that he had been given more than his share that
evening even though he was fat

Yes indeed Her laughter was continuous I should think you WOULD
be glad to get rid of me after that Ha ha ha Poor Mr Flitcroft
you know you are

It was the deadly truth and the fat one saying Well if youll just
excuse me now hurried away with a step which grew lighter as the
distance from her increased Arrived at the haven of a far doorway he
mopped his brow and shook his head grimly in response to frequent
rallyings

Ariel sat through more dances interminable dances and intermissions
in that same chair in which it began to seem she was to live out the
rest of her life Now and then if she thought people were looking at
her as they passed she broke into a laugh and nodded slightly as if
still amused over her mishap

After a long time she rose and laughing cheerfully to Mr Flitcroft
who was standing in the doorway and replied with a wan smile stepped
out quickly into the hall where she almost ran into her greatuncle
Jonas Tabor He was going towards the big front doors with Judge Pike
having just come out of the latters library down the hall

Jonas was breathing heavily and was shockingly pale though his eyes
were very bright He turned his back upon his grandniece sharply and
went out of the door Ariel turned from him quite as abruptly and
reentered the room whence she had come She laughed again to her fat
friend as she passed him and still laughing went towards the fatal
chair when her eyes caught sight of Eugene Bantry and Mamie coming in
through the window from the porch Still laughing she went to the
window and looked out the porch seemed deserted and was faintly
illuminated by a few Japanese lanterns She sprang out dropped upon
the divan and burying her face in her hands cried heartbrokenly
Presently she felt something alive touch her foot and her breath
catching with alarm she started to rise A thin hand issuing from a
shabby sleeve had stolen out between two of the green tubs and was
pressing upon one of her shoes

SH said Joe Dont make a noise

His warning was not needed she had recognized the hand and sleeve
instantly She dropped back with a low sound which would have been
hysterical if it had been louder while he raised himself on his arm
until she could see his face dimly as he peered at her between the
palms

What were you going on about he asked angrily

Nothing she answered I wasnt You must go away and quick
Its too dangerous If the Judge found you

He wont

Ah youd risk anything to see Mamie Pike

What were you crying about he interrupted

Nothing I tell you she repeated the tears not ceasing to gather in
her eyes I wasnt

I want to know what it was he insisted Didnt the fools ask you to
dance Ah You neednt tell me Thats it Ive been here for the
last three dances and you werent in sight till you came to the window
Well what do you care about that for

I dont she answered I dont Then suddenly without being able
to prevent it she sobbed

No he said gently I see you dont And you let yourself be a
fool because there are a lot of fools in there

She gave way all at once to a gust of sorrow and bitterness she bent
far over and caught his hand and laid it against her wet cheek Oh
Joe she whispered brokenly I think we have such hard lives you
and I It doesnt seem rightwhile were so young Why cant we be
like the others Why cant we have some of the fun

He withdrew his hand with the embarrassment and shame he would have
felt had she been a boy Get out he said feebly

She did not seem to notice but still stooping rested her elbows on
her knees and her face in her hands I try so hard to have fun to be
like the restand its always a mistake always always always
She rocked herself slightly from side to side I am a fool its
the truth or I wouldnt have come tonight I want to be
attractiveI want to be in things I want to laugh like they do

To laugh just to laugh and not because theres something funny

Yes I do I do And to know how to dress and to wear my hairthere
must be some place where you can learn those things Ive never had
any one to show me Ah Grandfather said something like that this
afternoonpoor man Were in the same case If we only had some one
to show us It all seems so BLIND here in Canaan for him and me I
dont say its not my own fault as much as being poor Ive been a
hoyden I dont feel as if Id learned how to be a girl yet Joe Its
only lately Ive cared but Im seventeen Joe andand
todaytodayI was sent homeand tonight She faltered came to
a stop and her whole body was shaken with sobs I hate myself so for
cryingfor everything

Ill tell you something he whispered chuckling desperately Gene
made me unpack his trunk and I dont believe hes as great a man at
college as he is here I opened one of his books and some one had
written in it Prigamaloo Bantry the Class TryToBe Hed never
noticed and you ought to have heard him go on Youd have just died
ArielI almost bust wide open It was a mean trick in me but I
couldnt help showing it to him

Joes object was obtained She stopped crying and wiping her eyes
smiled faintly Then she became grave Youre jealous of Eugene
she said

He considered this for a moment Yes he answered thoughtfully I
am But I wouldnt think about him differently on that account And I
wouldnt talk about him to any one but you

Not even to She left the question unfinished

No he said quietly Of course not

No Because it wouldnt be any use

I dont know I never have a chance to talk to her anyway

Of course you dont Her voice had grown steady You say Im a
fool What are you

You neednt worry about me he began I can take care

SH she whispered warningly The music had stopped a loud clatter
of voices and laughter succeeding it

What need to be careful Joe assured her with all that noise going
on

You must go away she said anxiously Oh please Joe

Not yet I want

She coughed loudly Eugene and Mamie Pike had come to the window with
the evident intention of occupying the veranda but perceiving Ariel
engaged with threads in her sleeve they turned away and disappeared
Other couples looked out from time to time and finding the solitary
figure in possession retreated abruptly to seek stairways and remote
corners for the things they were impelled to say

And so Ariel held the porch for three dances and three intermissions
occupying a great part of the time with entreaties that her obdurate
and reckless companion should go When for the fourth time the music
sounded her agitation had so increased that she was visibly trembling
I cant stand it Joe she said bending over him

I dont know what would happen if they found you Youve GOT to go

No I havent he chuckled They havent even distributed the
supper yet

And you take all the chances she said slowly just to see her pass
that window a few times

What chances

Of what the Judge will do if any one sees you

Nothing because if any one saw me Id leave

Please go

Not till

SH

A colored waiter smiling graciously came out upon the porch bearing a
tray of salad hot oysters and coffee Ariel shook her head

I dont want any she murmured

The waiter turned away in pity and was reentering the window when a
passionate whisper fell upon his ear as well as upon Ariels

TAKE IT

Maam said the waiter

Ive changed my mind she replied quickly The waiter his elation
restored gave of his viands with the superfluous bounty loved by his
race when distributing the product of the wealthy

When he had gone Give me everything thats hot said Joe You can
keep the salad

I couldnt eat it or anything else she answered thrusting the plate
between the palms

For a time there was silence From within the house came the
continuous babble of voices and laughter the clink of cutlery on
china The young people spent a long time over their supper Byandby
the waiter returned to the veranda deposited a plate of colored ices
upon Ariels knees with a noble gesture and departed

No ice for me said Joe

Wont you please go now she entreated

It wouldnt be good manners he responded They might think I only
came for supper

Hand me back the things The waiter might come for them any minute

Not yet I havent quite finished I eat with contemplation Ariel
because theres more than the mere food and the warmth of it to
consider Theres the pleasure of being entertained by the great Martin
Pike Think what a real kindness Im doing him too I increase his
good deeds and his hospitality without his knowing it or being able to
help it Dont you see how I boost his standing with the Recording
Angel If Lazarus had behaved the way I do Dives neednt have had
those worries that came to him in the afterlife

Give me the dish and coffeecup she whispered impatiently
Suppose the waiter came and had to look for them Quick

Take them then Youll see that jealousy hasnt spoiled my
appetite

A bottleshaped figure appeared in the window and she had no time to
take the plate and cup which were being pushed through the palmleaves
She whispered a syllable of warning and the dishes were hurriedly
withdrawn as Norbert Flitcroft wearing a solemn expression of injury
came out upon the veranda

He halted suddenly Whats that he asked with suspicion

Nothing answered Ariel sharply Where

Behind those palms

Probably your own shadow she laughed or it might have been a
draught moving the leaves

He did not seem satisfied but stared hard at the spot where the dishes
had disappeared meantime edging back cautiously nearer the window

They want you he said after a pause Some ones come for you

Oh is grandfather waiting She rose at the same time letting her
handkerchief fall She stooped to pick it up with her face away from
Norbert and towards the palms whispering tremulously but with
passionate urgency Please GO

It isnt your grandfather that has come for you said the fat one
slowly It is old Eskew Arp Somethings happened

She looked at him for a moment beginning to tremble violently her
eyes growing wide with fright

Is my grandfatheris he sick

You better go and see Old Eskews waiting in the hall Hell tell
you

She was by him and through the window instantly Norbert did not follow
her he remained for several moments looking earnestly at the palms
then he stepped through the window and beckoned to a youth who was
lounging in the doorway across the room

Theres somebody hiding behind those plants he whispered when his
friend reached him Go and tell Judge Pike to send some of the
niggers to watch outside the porch so that he doesnt get away Then
tell him to get his revolver and come here

Meanwhile Ariel had found Mr Arp waiting in the hall talking in a low
voice to Mrs Pike

Your grandfathers all right he told the frightened girl quickly
He sent me for you thats all Just hurry and get your things

She was with him again in a moment and seizing the old mans arm
hurried him down the steps and toward the street almost at a run

Youre not telling me the truth she said Youre not telling me the
truth

Nothing has happened to Roger panted Mr Arp Nothing to mind I
mean Here Were going this way not that They had come to the
gate and as she turned to the right he pulled her round sharply to the
left Were not going to your house

Where are we going

Were going to your uncle Jonass

Why she cried in supreme astonishment What do you want to take me
there for Dont you know that hes stopped speaking to me

Yes said the old man grimly with something of the look he wore
when delivering a clincher at the National Househes stopped
speaking to everybody



V

BEAVER BEACH

The Canaan Daily Tocsin of the following morning ventured the
assertion upon its front page that the scene at the Pike Mansion was
one of unalloyed festivity music and mirth a fairy bower of airy
figures wafting here and there to the throb of waltzstrains a
veritable Temple of Terpsichore shining forth with a myriad of lights
which together with the generous profusion of floral decorations and
the mingled delights afforded by Mindss orchestra of Indianapolis and
Caterer Jones of Chicago was in all likelihood never heretofore
surpassed in elegance in our city Only one incident the Tocsin
remarked marred an otherwise perfect occasion and out of regard for
the culprits family connections which are prominent in our social
world we withhold his name Suffice it to say that through the
vigilance of Mr Norbert Flitcroft grandson of Colonel A A
Flitcroft who proved himself a thorough Lecoq the celebrated French
detective the rascal was seized and recognized Mr Flitcroft
having discovered him in hiding had a cordon of waiters drawn up
around his hidingplace which was the charmingly decorated side piazza
of the Pike Mansion and sent for Judge Pike who came upon the
intruder by surprise He evaded the Judges indignant grasp but
received a wellmerited blow over the head from a poker which the Judge
had concealed about his person while pretending to approach the
hidingplace casually Attracted to the scene by the cries of Mr
Flitcroft who standing behind Judge Pike accidentally received a
blow from the same weapon all the guests of the evening sprang to view
the scene only to behold the culprit leap through a crevice between
the strips of canvas which enclosed the piazza He was seized by the
colored coachman of the Mansion Sam Warden and immediately pounced
upon by the cordon of Caterer Joness dusky assistants from Chicago
who were in ambush outside Unfortunately after a brief struggle he
managed to trip Warden and the others stumbling upon the prostrate
body of the latter to make his escape in the darkness

It is not believed by many that his intention was burglary though
what his designs were can only be left to conjecture as he is far
beyond the age when boys perform such actions out of a sense of
mischief He had evidently occupied his hidingplace some time and an
idea of his coolness may be obtained from his having procured and eaten
a full meal through an unknown source Judge Pike is justly incensed
and swears that he will prosecute him on this and other charges as soon
as he can be found Much sympathy is felt for the culprits family
who feel his shame most keenly but who though sorrowing over the
occurrence declare that they have put up with his derelictions long
enough and will do nothing to step between him and the Judges
righteous indignation

The Pike Mansion scene of festivity music and mirth not quite so
unalloyed after all the stricken Flitcroft keeping his room for a
week under medical supervision had not been the only bower of the
dance in Canaan that evening another Temple of Terpsichore had shone
forth with lights though of these there were not quite a myriad The
festivities they illumined obtained no mention in the paper nor did
they who trod the measures in this second temple exhibit any sense of
injury because of the Tocsins omission Nay they were of that class
shy without being bashful exclusive yet not proud which shuns
publicity with a singleheartedness almost unique in our republic
courting observation neither in the prosecution of their professions
nor in the pursuit of happiness

Not quite a mile above the northernmost of the factories on the
waterfront there projected into the river near the end of the
crescent bend above the town a long pier relic of steamboat days
rotting now and many years fallen from its maritime uses About
midway of its length stood a huge crazy shed long ago utilized as a
freight storeroom This had been patched and propped and a
dangerouslooking veranda attached to it overhanging the water
Above the doorway was placed a sign whereon might be read the words
Beaver Beach Mikes Place The shore end of the pier was so ruinous
that passage was offered by a single row of planks which presented an
appearance so temporary as well as insecure that one might have
guessed their office to be something in the nature of a drawbridge
From these a narrow path ran through a marsh left by the receding
river to a country road of desolate appearance Here there was a
rough enclosure or corral with some tumbledown sheds which afforded
shelter on the night of Joseph Loudens disgrace for a number of
shaggy teams attached to those decrepit and musty vehicles known
picturesquely and accurately as NightHawks The presence of such
questionable shapes in the corral indicated that the dance was on at
Beaver Beach Mikes Place as surely as the short line of cabs and
family carriages on upper Main Street made it known that gayety was the
order of the night at the Pike Mansion But among other differences
was this that at the hour when the guests of the latter were leaving
those seeking the hospitalities of Beaver Beach had just begun to
arrive

By three oclock however joy at Mikes Place had become beyond
question unconfined and the tokens of it were audible for a long
distance in all directions If however there is no sound where no
ear hears silence rested upon the countryside until an hour later
Then a lonely figure came shivering from the direction of the town not
by the road but slinking through the snow upon the frozen river It
came slowly as though very tired and cautiously too often turning
its head to look behind Finally it reached the pier and stopped as
if to listen

Within the house above a piano of evil life was being beaten to death
for its sins and clamoring its last cries horribly The old shed
rattled in every part with the thud of many heavy feet and trembled
with the shock of noisean incessant roar of mens voices punctuated
with womens screams Then the riot quieted somewhat there was a
clapping of hands and a violin began to squeak measures intended to be
Oriental The next moment the listener scrambled up one of the rotting
piles and stood upon the veranda A shaft of red light through a
broken shutter struck across the figure above the shoulders revealing
a bloody handkerchief clumsily knotted about the head and beneath it
the face of Joe Louden

He went to the broken shutter and looked in Around the blackened walls
of the room stood a bleared mob applausively watching through a fog
of smoke the contortions of an old woman in a red calico wrapper who
was dancing in the centre of the floor The fiddlera rubicund person
evidently not suffering from any great depression of spirit through the
circumstance of being out on bail as he was to Joes intimate
knowledgesat astride a barrel resting his instrument upon the foamy
tap thereof and playing somewhat after the manner of a cellist in no
wise incommoded by the fact that a tall man known to a few friends as
an expert in the porchclimbing line was sleeping on his shoulder
while another gentleman who had prevented many cases of typhoid by
removing old plumbing from houses lay on the floor at the musicians
feet and endeavored to assist him by plucking the strings of the fiddle

Joe opened the door and went in All of the merry company who were
able turned sharply toward the door as it opened then recognizing
the newcomer turned again to watch the old woman One or two nearest
the door asked the boy without great curiosity what had happened to
his head He merely shook it faintly in reply and crossed the room to
an open hallway beyond At the end of this he came to a frowzy bedroom
the door of which stood ajar Seated at a deal table and working by a
dim lamp with a broken chimney a closecropped redbearded
redhaired man in his shirtsleeves was jabbing gloomily at a column of
figures scrawled in a dirty ledger He looked up as Joe appeared in
the doorway and his eyes showed a slight surprise

I never thought ye had the temper to git somebody to split yer head
said he Whered ye collect it

Nowhere Joe answered dropping weakly on the bed It doesnt
amount to anything

Well Ill take just a look fer myself said the redbearded man
rising And Ive no objection to not knowin how ye come by it
Yeve always been the great one fer keepin yer mysteries to yerself

He unwound the handkerchief and removed it from Joes head gently
WHEE he cried as a long gash was exposed over the forehead I
hope ye left a mark somewhere to pay a little on the score o this

Joe chuckled and dropped dizzily back upon the pillow There was
another who got something like it he gasped feebly and oh Mike
I wish you could have heard him going on Perhaps you didit was only
three miles from here

Nothing Id liked better said the other bringing a basin of clear
water from a stand in the corner Its a beautiful thing to hear a
man holler when he gits a grand one like yere wearing tonight

He bathed the wound gently and hurrying from the room returned
immediately with a small jug of vinegar Wetting a rag with this
tender fluid he applied it to Joes head speaking soothingly the
while

Nothing in the world like a bit o good cider vinegar to keep off the
festerin It may seem a trifle scratchy fer the moment but it
assassinates the bloodpison There ye go Its the fine thing fer
ye Joewhat are ye squirmin about

Im only enjoying it the boy answered writhing as the vinegar
worked into the gash Dont you mind my laughing to myself

Yere a good one Joe said the other continuing his ministrations
I wisht after all ye felt like makin me known to whats the
trouble Theres some of us would be glad to take it up fer ye and

No no its all right I was somewhere I had no business to be and
I got caught

Who caught ye

First some nice white peopleJoe smiled his distorted smileand
then a lowdown black man helped me to get away as soon as he saw who
it was Hes a friend of mine and he fell down and tripped up the
pursuit

I always knew yed git into large trouble some day The redbearded
man tore a strip from an old towel and began to bandage the boys head
with an accustomed hand Yer taste fer excitement has been growin on
ye every minute of the four years Ive known ye

Excitement echoed Joe painfully blinking at his friend Do you
think Im hunting excitement

Be hanged to ye said the redbearded man Cant I say a teasing
word without gittin called to order fer it I know ye my boy as
well as ye know yerself Yere a queer one Yere one of the few that
must know all sides of the worldand cant content themselves with
bein respectable Ye havent sunk to low life because yere low
yourself but yell never git a damned one o the respectable to
believe it Theres a few others like ye in the wide world and Ive
seen one or two of em Ive been all over steeplechasin
sailorman soldier pedler and in the POlice Ive pulled the Grand
National in Paris and Ive been handcuffed in HongKong Ive seen all
the few kinds of women there is on earth and the many kinds of men
Yer own kind is the one Ive seen the fewest of but I knew ye belonged
to it the first time I laid eyes on ye He paused then continued
with conviction Yell come to no good either fer yerself yet no
one can say ye havent the talents Yeve helped many of the boys out
of a bad hole with a word of advice around the courts and the jail
Who knows but yed be a great lawyer if ye kept on

Young people usually like to discuss themselves under any
conditionshence the rewards of palmistrybut Joes comment on this
harangue was not so responsive as might have been expected Ive got
seven dollars he said and Ill leave the clothes Ive got on Can
you fix me up with something different

Aha cried the redbearded man Then ye ARE in trouble I thought
it d come to ye some day Have ye been dinnymitin Martin Pike

See what you can do said Joe I want to wait here until daybreak

Lie down then interrupted the other And fergit the hullabaloo in
the throneroom beyond

I can easily do thatJoe stretched himself upon the bedIve got
so many other things to remember

Ill have the things fer ye and Ill let ye know I have no use fer
seven dollars returned the redbearded man crossly What are ye
sniffin fer

Im thinking of the poor fellow that got the mate to this said Joe
touching the bandage I cant help crying when I think they may have
used vinegar on his head too

Git to sleep if ye can exclaimed the Samaritan as a hideous burst
of noise came from the danceroom where some one seemed to be breaking
a chair upon an acquaintance Ill go out and regulate the boys a
bit He turned down the lamp fumbled in his hippocket and went to
the door

Dont forget Joe called after him

Go to sleep said the redbearded man his hand on the doorknob
That is go to thinkin fer ye wont sleep yere not the kind But
think easy Ill have the things fer ye Its a matter of pride with
me that I always knew yed come to trouble

YELL TAK THE HIGH ROAD AND ILL TAK THE LOW ROAD

The day broke with a scream of wind out of the prairies and such
cloudbursts of snow that Joe could see neither bank of the river as he
made his way down the big bend of ice The wind struck so bitterly that
now and then he stopped and panting and gasping leaned his weight
against it The snow on the ground was caught up and flew like sea
spume in a hurricane it swirled about him joining the flakes in the
air so that it seemed to be snowing from the ground upward as much as
from the sky downward Fierce as it was hard as it was to fight
through snow from the earth snow from the sky Joe was grateful for
it feeling that it veiled him making him safer though he trusted
somewhat the change of costume he had effected at Beaver Beach A
rough workmans cap was pulled down over his ears and eyebrows a
knitted comforter was wound about the lower part of his face under a
ragged overcoat he wore blue overalls and rubber boots and in one of
his redmittened hands he swung a tin dinnerbucket

When he reached the nearest of the factories he heard the exhaust of
its engines long before he could see the building so blinding was the
drift Here he struck inland from the river and skirting the edges of
the town made his way by unfrequented streets and alleys bearing in
the general direction of upper Main Street to find himself at last
almost exhausted in the alley behind the Pike Mansion There he
paused leaning heavily against a board fence and gazing at the vaguely
outlined gray plane which was all that could be made of the house
through the blizzard He had often very often stood in this same
place at night and there was one window Mrs Pikes which he had
guessed to be Mamies

The storm was so thick that he could not see this window now but he
looked a long time through the thickness at that part of the gray plane
where he knew it was Then his lips parted

Goodbye Mamie he said softly Goodbye Mamie

He bent his body against the wind and went on still keeping to the
back ways until he came to the alley which passed behind his own home
where however he paused only for a moment to make a quick survey of
the premises A glance satisfied him he ran to the next fence
hoisted himself wearily over it and dropped into Roger Tabors back
yard

He took shelter from the wind for a moment or two leaning against the
fence breathing heavily then he stumbled on across the obliterated
paths of a vegetablegarden until he reached the house and beginning
with the kitchen began to make the circuit of the windows peering
cautiously into each as he went ready to tap on the pane should he
catch a glimpse of Ariel and prepared to run if he stumbled upon her
grandfather But the place seemed empty he had made his reconnaisance
apparently in vain and was on the point of going away when he heard
the click of the front gate and saw Ariel coming towards him her old
waterproof cloak about her head and shoulders the patched scant
faded skirt which he knew so well blowing about her tumultuously At
the sound of the gate he had crouched close against the side of the
house but she saw him at once

She stopped abruptly and throwing the waterproof back from her head
looked at him through the driven fog of snow One of her hands was
stretched towards him involuntarily and it was in that attitude that
he long remembered her standing in the drift which had piled up
against the gate almost kneedeep the shabby skirt and the black
waterproof flapping like torn sails one hand outstretched like that
of a figure in a tableau her brown face with its thin features mottled
with cold and unlovely her startled eyes fixed on him with a strange
wild tenderness that held something of the laughter of whole
companionship in it mingling with a loyalty and championship that was
almost ferociousshe looked an Undine of the snow

Suddenly she ran to him still keeping her hand outstretched until it
touched his own

How did you know me he said

Know you was all the answer she made to that question Come into
the house Ive got some coffee on the stove for you Ive been up
and down the street waiting for you ever since it began to get light

Your grandfather wont

Hes at Uncle Jonass he wont be back till noon Theres no one
here

She led him to the frontdoor where he stamped and shook himself he
was snow from head to foot

Im running away from the good Gomorrah he said but Ive stopped
to look back and Im a pretty white pillar

I know where you stopped to look back she answered brushing him
heartily with her red hands You came in the alley way It was
Mamies window

He did not reply and the only visible token that he had any
consciousness of this clairvoyance of hers was a slight lift of his
higher eyebrow She wasted no time in getting him to the kitchen
where when she had removed his overcoat she placed him in a chair
unwound the comforter and as carefully as a nurse lifted the cap
from his injured head When the strip of towel was disclosed she stood
quite still for a moment with the cap in her hand then with a broken
little cry she stooped and kissed a lock of his hair which escaped
discolored beneath the bandage

Stop that he commanded horribly embarrassed

Oh Joe she cried I knew I knew it was therebut to SEE it
And its my fault for leaving youI HAD to go or I wouldnt haveI

Whered you hear about it he asked shortly

I havent been to bed she answered Grandfather and I were up all
night at Uncle Jonass and Colonel Flitcroft came about two oclock
and he told us

Did he tell you about Norbert

Yesa great deal She poured coffee into a cup from a pot on the
stove brought it to him then placing some thin slices of bread upon a
gridiron began to toast them over the hot coals The Colonel said
that Norbert thought he wouldnt get well she concluded and Mr Arp
said Norbert was the kind that never die and they had quite an
argument

What were you doing at Jonas Tabors asked Joe drinking his coffee
with a brightening eye

We were sent for she answered

What for

She toasted the bread attentively without replying and when she
decided that it was brown enough piled it on a warm plate This she
brought to him and kneeling in front of him her elbow on his knee
offered for his consideration looking steadfastly up at his eyes He
began to eat ravenously

What for he repeated I didnt suppose Jonas would let you come in
his house Was he sick

Joe she said quietly disregarding his questionsJoe have you
GOT to run away

Yes Ive got to he answered

Would you have to go to prison if you stayed She asked this with a
breathless tensity

Im not going to beg father to help me out he said determinedly
He said he wouldnt and hell be spared the chance He wont mind
that nobody will care Nobody What does anybody care what _I_ do

Now youre thinking of Mamie she cried I can always tell
Whenever you dont talk naturally youre thinking of her

He poured down the last of the coffee growing red to the tips of his
ears Ariel he said if I ever come back

Wait she interrupted Would you have to go to prison right away if
they caught you

Oh it isnt that he laughed sadly But Im going to clear out
Im not going to take any chances I want to see other parts of the
world other kinds of people I might have gone anyhow soon even if
it hadnt been for last night Dont you ever feel that way

You know I do she said Ive told youhow often But Joe
Joeyou havent any MONEY Youve got to have money to LIVE

You neednt worry about that returned the master of seven dollars
genially Ive saved enough to take care of me for a LONG time

Joe PLEASE I know it isnt so If you could wait just a little
whileonly a few weeksonly a FEW Joe

What for

I could let you have all you want It would be such a beautiful thing
for me Joe Oh I know how youd feel you wouldnt even let me give
you that dollar I found in the street last year but this would be only
lending it to you and you could pay me back sometime

Ariel he exclaimed and setting his empty cup upon the floor took
her by the shoulders and shook her till the empty plate which had held
the toast dropped from her hand and broke into fragments Youve been
reading the Arabian Nights

No no she cried vehemently Grandfather would give me anything
Hell give me all the money I ask for

Money said Joe Which of us is wandering MONEY Roger Tabor give
you MONEY

Not for a while A great many things have to be settled first

What things

Joe she asked earnestly do you think its bad of me not to feel
things I OUGHT to feel

No

Then Im glad she said and something in the way she spoke made him
start with pain remembering the same words spoken in the same tone
by another voice the night before on the veranda Im glad Joe
because I seemed all wrong to myself Uncle Jonas died last night and
I havent been able to get sorry Perhaps its because Ive been so
frightened about you but I think not for I wasnt sorry even before
Colonel Flitcroft told me about you

Jonas Tabor dead said Joe Why I saw him on the street yesterday

Yes and I saw him just before I came out on the porch where you were
He was there in the hall he and Judge Pike had been having a long
talk theyd been in some speculations together and it had all turned
out well Its very strange but they say now that Uncle Jonass heart
was weakhe was an old man you know almost eightyand hed been
very anxious about his money The Judge had persuaded him to risk it
and the shock of finding that hed made a great deal suddenly

Ive heard hed had that same shock before said Joe when he sold
out to your father

Yes but this was different grandfather says He told me it was in
one of those big risky businesses that Judge Pike likes to go into
And last night it was all finished the strain was over and Uncle
Jonas started home His house is only a little way from the Pikes
you know but he dropped down in the snow at his own gate and some
people who were going by saw him fall He was dead before grandfather
got there

I cant be sorry said Joe slowly

Neither can I Thats the dreadful part of it They say he hadnt
made a will that though he was sharper than anybody else in the whole
world about any other matter of business that was the one thing he put
off And were all the kin he had in the world grandfather and I
And they sayher voice sank to a whisper of excitementthey say he
was richer than anybody knew and that this last business with Judge
Pike the very thing that killed himsomething about grainmade him
five times richer than before

She put her hand on the boys arm and he let it remain there Her
eyes still sought his with a tremulous appeal

God bless you Ariel he said Its going to be a great thing for
you

Yes Yes it is The tears came suddenly to her eyes I was
foolish last night but there had been such a long time of WANTING
things and nowand now grandfather and I can go

Youre going too Joe chuckled

Its heartless I suppose but Ive settled it Were going

_I_ know he cried Youve told me a thousand times what HES
saidten times a thousand Youre going to Paris

Paris Yes thats it To Paris where he can see at last how the
great ones have paintedwhere the others can show him To Paris
where we can study together where he can learn how to put the pictures
he sees upon canvas and where I

Go on Joe encouraged her I want to hear you say it You dont
mean that youre going to study painting you mean that youre going to
learn how to make such fellows as Eugene ask you to dance Go ahead
and SAY it

Yesto learn how to DRESS she said

Joe was silent for a moment Then he rose and took the ragged overcoat
from the back of his chair Wheres that muffler he asked

She brought it from where she had placed it to dry behind the stove

Joe she said huskily cant you wait till

Till the estate is settled and you can coax your grandfather to

No no But you could go with us

To Paris

He would take you as his secretary

Aha Joes voice rang out gayly as he rose refreshed by the coffee
toast and warmth she had given him Youve been storyreading
Ariel like Eugene Secretary

Please Joe

Wheres my tin dinnerpail He found it himself upon the table where
he had set it down Im going to earn a dishonest living he went on
I have an engagement to take a freight at a watertank thats a friend
of mine half a mile south of the yards Thank God Im going to get
away from Canaan

Wait Joe She caught at his sleeve I want you to

He had swung out of the room and was already at the frontdoor She
followed him closely

Goodbye Ariel

No no WAIT Joe

He took her right hand in his own and gave it a manly shake Its
all right he said

He threw open the door and stepped out but she sought to detain him
Oh have you GOT to go she cried

Dont you ever worry about me He bent his head to the storm as he
sprang down the steps and snowwreaths swirled between them

He disappeared in a white whirlwind

She stood for several minutes shivering in the doorway Then it came
to her that she would not know where to write to him She ran down to
the gate and through it Already the blizzard had covered his
footprints



VII

GIVE A DOG A BAD NAME

The passing of Joseph from Canaan was complete It was an evanishment
for which there was neither sackcloth nor surprise and though there
came no news of him it cannot be said that Canaan did not hear of him
for surely it could hear itself talk The death of Jonas Tabor and
young Loudens crime and flight incited high doings in the National
House windows many days the sages lingered with the broken meats of
morals left over from the banquet of gossip But after all it is
with the ladies of a community that reputations finally rest and the
matrons of Canaan had long ago made Joes exceedingly uncertain Now
they made it certain

They did not fail of assistance The most powerful influence in the
town was ponderously corroborative Martin Pike who stood for all that
was respectable and financial who passed the plate o Sundays who
held the fortunes of the town in his left hand who was trustee for the
widow and orphanMartin Pike patron of all worthy charities courted
by ministers feared by the wicked and idle revered by the
goodJudge Martin Pike never referred to the runaway save in the
accents of an august doomster His testimony settled it

In time the precise nature of the fugitives sins was distorted in
report and grew vague it was recalled that he had done dread things
he became a tradition a legend and a warning to the young a Richard
in the bush to frighten colts He was preached at boys caught playing
marbles for keeps Do you want to grow up like Joe Louden The
very name became a darkling threat and children of the town would have
run had one called suddenly HERE COMES JOE LOUDEN Thus does the
evil men do live after them and the illfame of the unrighteous
increase when they are sped

Very little of Josephs adventures and occupations during the time of
his wandering is revealed to us he always had an unwilling memory for
pain and was not afterwards wont to speak of those years which cut the
hard lines in his face The first account of him to reach Canaan came
as directly to the windows of the National House as Mr Arp
hastening thither from the station satchel in hand could bring it

This was on a September morning two years after the flight and Eskew
it appears had been to the State Fair and had beheld many things
strangely affirming his constant testimony that this unhappy world
increaseth in sin strangest of all his meeting with our vagrant
scalawag of Canaan Not a BLAMEBIT of doubt about it declared Eskew
to the incredulous conclave There was that Joe and nobody else
stuck up in a little box outside a tent at the Fair Grounds and
sellin tickets to see the Spotted Wild Boy Yes it was Joe Louden
Think you Mr Arp could forget that face those crooked eyebrows Had
Eskew tested the recognition Had he spoken with the outcast Had he
not Ay but with such peculiar result that the battle of words among
the sages began with a true onset of the regulars for according to
Eskews narrative when he had delivered grimly at the boy this charge
I know youYOURE JOE LOUDEN the extraordinary reply had been made
promptly and without change of countenance POSITIVELY NO FREE SEATS

On this the house divided one party maintaining that Joe had thus
endeavored to evade recognition the other to the embitterment of Mr
Arp that the reply was a distinct admission of identity and at the
same time a refusal to grant any favors on the score of past
acquaintanceship

Goaded by inquiries Mr Arp who had little desire to recall such
waste of silver admitted more than he had intended that he had
purchased a ticket and gone in to see the Spotted Wild Boy halting in
his description of this marvel with the unsatisfactory and acrid
statement that the Wild Boy was simply SPOTTEDand the stung query
I suppose you know what a spot IS Squire When he came out of the
tent he had narrowly examined the ticketsellerwho seemed unaware of
his scrutiny and when not engaged with his tickets applied himself
to a dirty lawlooking book It was Joseph Louden reasserted Eskew a
little taller a little paler incredibly shabby and miraculously thin
If there were any doubt left his forehead was somewhat disfigured by
the scar of an old woundsuch as might have been caused by a blunt
instrument in the nature of a poker

Whats the matter with YOU Mr Arp whirled upon Uncle Joe Davey who
was enjoying himself by repeating at intervals the unreasonable words
Couldnt of ben Joe without any explanation Why couldnt it
shouted Eskew It was Do you think my eyes are as fur gone as yours
I saw him I tell you The same ornery Joe Louden run away and
sellin tickets for a sideshow He wasnt even the boss of it the
manager was about the meanestlookin human I ever sawand most humans
look mighty mean accordin to my way of thinkin Riffraff of the
riffraff are his friends now same as they were here Weeds and HES
a weed always was and always will be Him and his kind aint any more
than jimpsons overrun everything if you give em a chance
Devilflowers They have to be hoed out and scatteredeven then like
as not theyll come back next year and ruin your plantin once more
That boy Joe ll turn up here again some day youll see if he dont
Hes a seed of trouble and iniquity and anything of that kind is sure
to come back to Canaan

Mr Arp stuck to his prediction for several months then he began to
waver and evade By the end of the second year following its first
utterance he had formed the habit of denying that he had ever made it
at all and finally having come to believe with all his heart that the
prophecy had been deliberately foisted upon him and put in his mouth by
Squire Buckalew became so sore upon the subject that even the hardiest
dared not refer to it in his presence

Eskews story of the ticketseller was the only news of Joe Louden that
came to Canaan during seven years Another citizen of the town
encountered the wanderer however but under circumstances so
susceptible to misconception that in a moment of illumination he
decided to let the matter rest in a golden silence This was Mr
Bantry

Having elected an elaborate course in the Arts at the University which
was of his possessions what more natural than that Eugene should seek
the Metropolis for the short Easter vacation of his Senior year in
order that his perusal of the Masters should be uninterrupted But it
was his misfortune to find the Metropolitan Museum less interesting
than some intricate phases of the gayety of New Yorkphases very
difficult to understand without elaborate study and a series of
experiments which the discreetly selfish permit others to make for
them Briefly Eugene found himself dancing one night with a young
person in a big hat at the StrawCellar a crowded hall down very
deep in the town and not at all the place for Eugene

Acute crises are to be expected at the StrawCellar and Eugene was
the only one present who was thoroughly surprised when that of this
night arrived though all of the merrymakers were frightened when they
perceived its extent There is no need to detail the catastrophe It
came suddenly and the knife did not flash Sick and thinking of
himself Eugene stood staring at the figure lying before him upon the
reddening floor A rabble fought with the quick policemen at the
doors and then the lights went out extinguished by the proprietor
living up to his reputation for always being thoughtful of his patrons
The place had been a nightmare it became a black impossibility Eugene
staggered to one of the open windows from the sill of which a man had
just leaped

Dont jump said a voice close to his ear That fellow broke his
leg I think and they caught him anyway as soon as he struck the
pavement Its a big raid Come this way

A light hand fell upon his arm and he followed its leading blindly to
find himself pushed through a narrow doorway and down a flight of
tricky wooden steps at the foot of which silhouetted against a
street light a tall policeman was on guard He laid masterful hands on
Eugene

SH Mack whispered a cautious voice from the stairway Thats a
friend of mine and not one of those you need Hes only a student and
scared to death

Hurry said the policeman under his breath twisting Eugene sharply
by him into the street after which he stormed vehemently On yer
way both of ye Move on up the street Dont be tryin to poke yer
heads in here Yed be more anxious to git out once ye got in I tell
ye

A sob of relief came from Bantry as he gained the next corner the
slight figure of his conductor at his side Youd better not go to
places like the StrawCellar said the latter gravely Id been
watching you for an hour You were dancing with the girl who did the
cutting

Eugene leaned against a wall faint one arm across his face He was
too ill to see or care who it was that had saved him I never saw
her before he babbled incoherently never never never I thought
she looked handsome and asked her if shed dance with me Then I saw
she seemed queerand wild and she kept guiding and pushing as we
danced until we were near that manand then shethen it was all
donebefore

Yes said the other shes been threatening to do it for a long
time Jealous Mighty good sort of a girl though in lots of ways
Only yesterday I talked with her and almost thought Id calmed her out
of it But you cant tell with some women Theyll brighten up and
talk straight and seem sensible one minute and promise to behave and
mean it too and the next there they go making a scene cutting
somebody or killing themselves You cant count on them But thats
not to the point exactly I expect Youd better keep away from the
StrawCellar If youd been caught with the rest youd have had a
hard time and theyd have found out your real name too because its
pretty serious on account of your dancing with her when she did it and
the Canaan papers would have got hold of it and you wouldnt be invited
to Judge Pikes any more Eugene

Eugene dropped his arm from his eyes and stared into the face of his
stepbrother

Joe Louden he gasped

Ill never tell said Joe Youd better keep out of all this sort
You dont understand it and you dontyou dont do it because you
care He smiled wanly his odd distorted smile of friendliness When
you go back you might tell father Im all right Im working through a
lawschool hereand remember me to Norbert Flitcroft he finished
with a chuckle

Eugene covered his eyes again and groaned

Its all right Joe assured him Youre as safe as if it had never
happened And I expecthe went on thoughtfullyI expect maybe
youd prefer NOT to say youd seen me when you go back to Canaan
Well thats all right I dont suppose father will be asking after
meexactly

No he doesnt said Eugene still white and shaking Dont stand
talking Im sick

Of course returned Joe But theres one thing I would like to ask
you

Your fathers health is perfect I believe

Ititit was something else Joe stammered pitifully Are they
allare they allall right atat Judge Pikes

Quite Eugene replied sharply Are you going to get me away from
here Im sick I tell you

This street said Joe and cheerfully led the way

Five minutes later the two had parted and Joe leaned against a cheap
restaurant signboard drearily staring after the lamps of the gypsy
nightcab he had found for his stepbrother Eugene had not offered to
share the vehicle with him had not even replied to his goodnight

And Joe himself had neglected to do something he might well have done
he had not asked Eugene for news of Ariel Tabor It will not justify
him entirely to suppose that he assumed that her grandfather and she
had left Canaan never to return and therefore Eugene knew nothing of
her no such explanation serves Joe for his neglect for the fair truth
is that he had not thought of her She had been a sort of playmate
before his flight a friend taken for granted about whom he had
consciously thought little more than he thought about himselfand
easily forgotten Not forgotten in the sense that she had passed out
of his memory but forgotten none the less she had never had a place
in his imaginings and so it befell that when he no longer saw her from
day to day she had gone from his thoughts altogether



VIII

A BAD PENNY TURNS UP

Eugene did not inform Canaan nor any inhabitant of his adventure of
StrawCellar nor did any hear of his meeting with his stepbrother
and after Mr Arps adventure five years passed into the imperishable
before the town heard of the wanderer again and then it heard at first
hand Mr Arps prophecy fell true and he took it back to his bosom
again claimed it as his own the morning of its fulfilment Joe Louden
had come back to Canaan

The elder Louden was the first to know of his prodigals return He
was alone in the office of the woodenbutterdish factory of which he
was the superintendent when the young man came in unannounced He was
still pale and thin his eyebrows had the same crook one corner of his
mouth the same droop he was only an inch or so taller not enough to
be thought a tall man and yet for a few moments the father did not
recognize his son but stared at him inquiring his business During
those few seconds of unrecognition Mr Louden was somewhat favorably
impressed with the strangers appearance

You dont know me said Joe smiling cheerfully Perhaps Ive
changed in seven years And he held out his hand

Then Mr Louden knew he tilted back in his deskchair his mouth
falling open Good God he said not noticing the outstretched
hand Have YOU come back

Joes hand fell

Yes Ive come back to Canaan

Mr Louden looked at him a long time without replying finally he
remarked

I see youve still got a scar on your forehead

Oh Ive forgotten all about that said the other twisting his hat
in his hands Seven years wipes out a good many grievances and
wrongs

You think so Mr Louden grunted I suppose it might wipe out a good
deal with some people Howd you happen to stop off at Canaan On your
way somewhere I suppose

No Ive come back to stay

Mr Louden plainly received this as no pleasant surprise What for
he asked slowly

To practise law father

What

Yes said the young man There ought to be an opening here for me
Im a graduate of as good a lawschool as there is in the country

You are

Certainly said Joe quietly Ive put myself through working in
the summer

Working Mr Louden snorted Sideshows

Oh worse than that sometimes returned his son laughing
Anything I could get But Ive always wanted to come back home and
work here

Mr Louden leaned forward a hand on each knee his brow deeply
corrugated Do you think youll get much practice in Canaan

Why not Ive had a year in a good office in New York since I left
the school and I think I ought to get along all right

Oh said Mr Louden briefly You do

Yes Dont you

Who do you think in Canaan would put a case in your hands

Oh I dont expect to get anything important at the start But after
a while

With your reputation

The smile which had faded from Joes lips returned to them Oh I
know they thought I was a harumscarum sort of boy he answered
lightly and that it was a foolish thing to run away for nothing but
you had said I mustnt come to you for help

I meant it said Mr Louden

But thats seven years ago and I suppose the towns forgotten all
about it and forgotten me too So you see I can make a fresh
start Thats what I came back for

Youve made up your mind to stay here then

Yes

I dont believe said Mr Louden with marked uneasiness that Mrs
Louden would be willing to let you live with us

No said Joe gently I didnt expect it He turned to the window
and looked out averting his face yet scoring himself with the
contempt he had learned to feel for those who pity themselves His
father had not even asked him to sit down There was a long silence
disturbed only by Mr Loudens breathing which could be heard heavy
and troubled

At last Joe turned again smiling as before Well I wont keep you
from your work he said I suppose youre pretty busy

Yes I am responded his father promptly But Ill see you again
before you go I want to give you some advice

Im not going said Joe Not going to leave Canaan I mean Where
will I find Eugene

At the Tocsin office hes the assistant editor Judge Pike bought the
Tocsin last year and he thinks a good deal of Eugene Dont forget I
said to come to see me again before you go

Joe came over to the older man and held out his hand Shake hands
father he said Mr Louden looked at him out of small implacable
eyes the steady hostility of which only his wife or the imperious
Martin Pike his employer could quell He shook his head

I dont see any use in it he answered It wouldnt mean anything
All my life Ive been a hardworking man and an abiding man Before
you got in trouble you never did anything you ought to you ran with
the lowest people in town and I and all your folks were ashamed of
you I dont see that weve got a call to be any different now He
swung round to his desk emphatically on the last word and Joe turned
away and went out quietly

But it was a bright morning to which he emerged from the outer doors of
the factory and he made his way towards Main Street at a lively gait
As he turned the corner opposite the National House he walked into
Mr Eskew Arp The old man drew back angrily

Lord a mercy cried Joe heartily Its Mr Arp I almost ran
you down Then as Mr Arp made no response but stood stockstill in
the way staring at him fiercely Dont you know me Mr Arp the
young man asked Im Joe Louden

Eskew abruptly thrust his face close to the others NO FREE SEATS
he hissed savagely and swept across to the hotel to set his world
afire

Joe looked after the irate receding figure and watched it disappear
into the Main Street door of the National House As the door closed
he became aware of a mighty shadow upon the pavement and turning
beheld a fat young man wearing upon his forehead a scar similar to his
own waddling by with eyes fixed upon him

How are you Norbert Joe began Dont you remember me I He
came to a full stop as the fat one thrusting out an under lip as his
only token of recognition passed balefully on

Joe proceeded slowly until he came to the Tocsin building At the foot
of the stairway leading up to the offices he hesitated for a few
moments then he turned away and walked towards the quieter part of
Main Street Most of the people he met took no notice of him only two
or three giving him second glances of halfcognizance as though he
reminded them of some one they could not place and it was not until he
had come near the Pike Mansion that he saw a full recognition in the
eyes of one of the many whom he knew and who had known him in his
boyhood in the town A lady turning a corner looked up carelessly
and then halfstopped within a few feet of him as if startled Joes
cheeks went a sudden crimson for it was the lady of his old dreams

Seven years had made Mamie Pike only prettier She had grown into her
young womanhood with an ampleness that had nothing of oversufficiency
in it nor anywhere a threat that some day there might be too much of
her Not quite seventeen when he had last seen her now at
twentyfour her amber hair elaborately becoming a plump and regular
face all of her old charm came over him once more and it immediately
seemed to him that he saw clearly his real reason for coming back to
Canaan She had been the RichLittleGirl of his child days the
golden princess playing in the PalaceGrounds and in his early boyhood
until he had grown wicked and shabby he had been sometimes invited to
the Pike Mansion for the games and icecream of the daughter of the
house before her dancing days began He had gone timidly not daring
ever to call her in Quaker Meeting or Postoffice but watching
her reverently and surreptitiously and continually She had always
seemed to him the one thing of all the world most rare most
mysterious most unapproachable She had not offered an apparition
less so in those days when he began to come under the suspicion of
Canaan when the old people began to look upon him hotly the young
people coldly His very exclusion wove for him a glamour about her
and she was more than ever his moon far lovely unattainable and
brilliant never to be reached by his lifted arms but only by his
lifted eyes Nor had his long absence obliterated that light
somewhere in his dreams it always had place shining perhaps with a
fainter lustre as the years grew to seven but never gone altogether
Now at last that he stood in her very presence again it sprang to
the full flood of its old brillianceand more

As she came to her halfstop of surprise startled he took his courage
in two hands and lifting his hat stepped to her side

Youyou remember me he stammered

Yes she answered a little breathlessly

Ah thats kind of you he cried and began to walk on with her
unconsciously I feel like a returned ghost wandering
aboutinvisible and unrecognized So few people seem to remember me

I think you are wrong I think youll find everybody remembers you
she responded uneasily

No Im afraid not he began I

Im afraid they do

Joe laughed a little My father was saying something like that to me
a while ago He meant that they used to think me a great scapegrace
here Do you mean that

Id scarcely like to say she answered her face growing more
troubled for they were close on the imperial domain

But its long agoand I really didnt do anything so outrageous it
seems to me He laughed again I know your father was angry with me
once or twice especially the night I hid on your porch to watch
youto watch you dance I mean But you see Ive come back to
rehabilitate myself to

She interrupted him They were not far from her gate and she saw her
father standing in the yard directing a painter who was at work on one
of the castiron deer The Judge was apparently in good spirits
laughing with the workman over some jest between them but that did not
lessen Mamies nervousness

Mr Louden she said in as kindly a tone as she could I shall have
to ask you not to walk with me My father would not like it

Joe stopped with a jerk

Why II thought Id go in and shake hands with himand tell him
I

Astonishment that partook of terror and of awe spread itself instantly
upon her face

Good gracious she cried NO

Very well said Joe humbly Goodbye

He was too late to get away with any good grace Judge Pike had seen
them and even as Joe turned to go rushed down to the gate flung it
open and motioned his daughter to enter This he did with one wide
sweep of his arm and with another sweep forbade Joe to look upon
either moon OR sun It was a magnificent gesture it excluded the
young man from the street Judge Pikes street and from the town
Judge Pikes town It swept him from the earth abolished him denied
him the right to breathe the common air to be seen of men and at
once a headsmans stroke and an excommunication destroyed him soul
and body thus rebuking the silly Providence that had created him and
repairing Its mistake by annihilating him This hurling Olympian
gesture smote the street the rails of the cartrack sprang and
quivered with the shock it thundered and amid the dumfounding uproar
of the wrath of a god the Will of the Canaanite Jove wrote the words
in fiery letters upon the ether

CEASE TO BE

Joe did not go in to shake hands with Judge Pike

He turned the next corner a moment later and went down the quiet
street which led to the house which had been his home He did not
glance at that somewhat grim edifice but passed it his eyes averted
and stopped in front of the long ramshackle cottage next door The
windows were boarded the picketfence dropped even to the ground in
some sections the chimneys sagged and curved the roof of the long
porch sprinkled shingles over the unkempt yard with every wind and
seemed about to fall The place was desolate with long emptiness and
decay it looked like a Haunted House and nailed to the padlocked gate
was a sign half obliterated with the winters it had fronted For Sale
or Rent

Joe gat him meditatively back to Main Street and to the Tocsin
building This time he did not hesitate but mounted the stairs and
knocked upon the door of the assistant editor

Oh said Eugene YOUVE turned up you

Mr Bantry of the Tocsin was not at all the Eugene rescued from the
StrawCellar The present gentleman was more the electric Freshman
than the frightened adventurer whom Joe had encountered in New York
It was to be seen immediately that the assistant editor had nothing
undaintily businesslike about him nor was there the litter on his
desk which one might have expected He had the air of a gentleman
dilettante who amused himself slightly by spending an hour or two in
the room now and then It was the evolution to the perfect of his
Freshman manner and his lively apparel though somewhat chastened by
an older taste might have been foretold from that which had smitten
Canaan seven years before He sat not at the orderly and handsome
desk but lay stretched upon a divan of green leather smoking a cigar
of purest ray and reading sleepily a small verselooking book in
morocco His occupation his general air the furniture of the room
and his title doubtless equipped with a corresponding salary might
have inspired in an observant cynic the idea that here lay a pet of
Fortune whose position had been the fruit of nepotism or mayhap a
successful wooing of some daughter wife or widow Eugene looked
competent for that

Ive come back to stay Gene said Joe

Bantry had dropped his book and raised himself on an elbow
Exceedingly interesting he said I suppose youll try to find
something to do I dont think you could get a place here Judge Pike
owns the Tocsin and I greatly fear he has a prejudice against you

I expect he has Joe chuckled somewhat sadly But I dont want
newspaper work Im going to practice law

By Jove you have courage my festive prodigal VRAIMENT

Joe cocked his head to one side with his old look of the friendly
puppy You always did like to talk that noveletty way Gene didnt
you he said impersonally

Eugenes color rose Have you saved up anything to starve on he
asked crisply

Oh Im not so badly off Ive had a salary in an office for a year
and I had one pretty good day at the races

Youd better go back and have another said his stepbrother You
dont seem to comprehend your standing in Canaan

Im beginning to Joe turned to the door Its funny tooin a
way WellI wont keep you any longer I just stopped in to say
goodday He paused faltering

All right all right Eugene said briskly And bytheway I
havent mentioned that I saw you in New York

Oh I didnt suppose that you would

And you neednt say anything about it I fancy

I dont think said JoeI dont think that you need be afraid Ill
do that Goodbye

Be sure to shut the door please its rather noisy with it open
Goodbye Eugene waved his hand and sank back upon the divan

Joe went across the street to the National House The sages fell as
silent as if he had been Martin Pike They had just had the pleasure
of hearing a telephone monologue by Mr Brown the clerk to which they
listened intently Yes This is Brown Ohoh its Judge Pike
Yes indeed Judge yes indeed I hear youha ha Of course I
understand Yes Judge I heard he was in town No he hasnt been
here Not yet that is Judge Yes I hear No I wont of course
Certainly not I will I will I hear perfectly I understand Yes
sir Goodbye Judge

Joe had begun to write his name in the register My trunk is still at
the station he said Ill give you my check to send down for it

Excuse me said the clerk We have no rooms

What cried Joe innocently Why I never knew more than eight
people to stay here at the same time in my life

We have no rooms repeated the clerk curtly

Is there a convention here

We have no rooms I say

Joe looked up into the condensed eyes of Mr Brown Oh he said I
see

Deathly silence followed him to the door but as it closed behind him
he heard the outbreak of the sages like a tidal wave striking a
dumpheap of tin cans

Two hours later he descended from an evil ark of a cab at the corral
attached to Beaver Beach and followed the path through the marsh to
the crumbling pier A redbearded man was seated on a plank by the
water edge fishing

Mike said Joe have you got room for me Can you take me in for a
few days until I find a place in town where theyll let me stay

The redbearded man rose slowly pushed back his hat and stared hard
at the wanderer then he uttered a howl of joy and seized the others
hands in his and shook them wildly

Glory be on high he shouted Its Joe Louden come back We never
knew how we missed ye till yed gone Place fer ye Can I find it
There aint a imp o perdition in town includin myself that wouldnt
kill me if I couldnt Yell have old Maggies room my own aunts ye

night Therell be many of em will come when they hear yere back in
Canaan Praise God well all hope yere goin to stay a while

OUTER DARKNESS

If any echo of doubt concerning his undesirable conspicuousness sounded
faintly in Joes mind it was silenced eftsoons Canaan had not
forgotten himfar from itso far that it began pointing him out to
strangers on the street the very day of his return His course of
action likewise that of his friends permitted him little obscurity
and when the rumors of his finally obtaining lodging at Beaver Beach
and of the celebration of his installation there were presently
confirmed he stood in the limelight indeed as a Mephistopheles
upsprung through the trapdoor

The welcoming festivities had not been so discreetly conducted as to
accord with the general policy of Beaver Beach An unfortunate
incident caused the arrest of one of the celebrators and the
ambulancing to the hospital of another on the homeward way the ensuing
proceedings in court bringing to the whole affair a publicity devoutly
unsought for Mr Happy Fear such was the habitual name of the
imprisoned gentleman had to bear a great amount of harsh criticism for
injuring a companion within the city limits after daylight and for
failing to observe that three policemen were not too distant from the
scene of operations to engage therein

Happy if ye had it in mind to harm him said the redbearded man to
Mr Fear upon the latters return to society why didnt ye do it out
here at the Beach

Because returned the indiscreet he didnt say what he was goin to
say till we got in town

Extraordinary probing on the part of the prosecutor had developed at
the trial that the obnoxious speech had referred to the guest of the
evening The assaulted party one Nashville Cory was not of Canaan
but a bit of driftwood haply touching shore for the moment at Beaver
Beach andstrange is this worldhe had been introduced to the
coterie of Mikes Place by Happy Fear himself who had enjoyed a brief
acquaintance with him on a day when both had chanced to travel
incognito by the same freight Naturally Happy had felt responsible
for the proper behavior of his protegewas in fact bound to enforce
it additionally Happy had once been saved from a term of imprisonment
at a time when it would have been more than ordinarily inconvenient
by help and advice from Joe and he was not one to forget Therefore he
was grieved to observe that his own guest seemed to be somewhat jealous
of the hero of the occasion and disposed to look coldly upon him The
stranger however contented himself with innuendo mere expressions of
the face and other manner of things for which one could not squarely
lay hands upon him until such time as he and his sponsor had come to
Main Street in the clear dawn on their way to Happys apartmenta
variable abode It may be that the stranger perceived what Happy did
not the three bluecoats in the perspective at all events he now put
into words of simple strength the unfavorable conception he had formed
of Joe The result was mediaevally immediate and the period of Mr
Corys convalescence in the hospital was almost half that of his
sponsors detention in the county jail

It needed nothing to finish Joe with the good people of Canaan had it
needed anything the trial of Happy Fear would have overspilled the
necessity An item of the testimony was that Joseph Louden had helped
to carry one of the ladies presenta Miss Le Roy who had faintedto
the open air and had jostled the stranger in passing After this the
oldest woman in Canaan would not have dared to speak to Joe on the
street even if she wanted to unless she happened to be very poor or
very wicked The Tocsin printed an adequate account for there was a
large public interest recording in conclusion that Mr Louden paid
the culprits fine which was the largest in the power of the presiding
judge in his mercy to bestow Editorially the Tocsin leaned to the
facetious Mr Louden has but recently returned to our midst We
fervently hope that the distinguished Happy Fear will appreciate his
patrons superb generosity We say his patron but perhaps we err in
this Were it not better to figure Mr Louden as the lady in distress
Mr Fear as the champion in the lists In the present case however
contrary to the rules of romance the champion falls in duress and
passes to the dungeon We merely suggest en passant that some of our
best citizens might deem it a wonderful and beauteous thing if in
addition to paying the fine Mr Louden could serve for the loyal Happy
his six months in the Bastile

En passant if nothing else would have revealed to Joe in this
imitation of a better trick the hand of Eugene And little doubt he
would have agreed with Squire Buckalew in the Squires answer to the
easily expected comment of Mr Arp

Sometimes said Eskew I think that Gene Bantry is jest a leetle
bit spiderier than he is lazy Thats the first thing hes written in
the Tocsin this monthone of the boys over there told me He wrote it
out of spite against Joe but hed ought to of done better If his
spite hadnt run away with what mind hes got hed of said that both
Joe Louden and that tramp Fear ought to of had ten years

Gene Bantry didnt write that out of spite answered Buckalew He
only thought he saw a chance to be kind of funny and please Judge Pike
The Judge has always thought Joe was a noaccount

Aint he right cried Mr Arp

_I_ dont say he aint Squire Buckalew cast a glance at Mr Brown
the clerk and perceiving that he was listening added The Judge
always IS right

Yes sir said Colonel Flitcroft

I cant stand up for Joe Louden to any extent but I dont think he
done wrong Buckalew went on recovering when he paid this man
Fears fine

You dont exclaimed Mr Arp Why havent you got gumption enough
to see

Look here Eskew interposed his antagonist How many friends have
you got that hate to hear folks talk bad about you

Not a one For once Eskews guard was down and his consistency led
him to destruction Not a one It aint in human nature Theyre
bound to enjoy it

Got any friends that would FIGHT for you

Eskew walked straight into this hideous trap No There aint a dozen
men ever LIVED that had Caesar was a popular man but he didnt have
a soul to help him when the crowd lit on him and Ill bet old Mark
Antony was mighty glad they got him out in the yard before it
happenedHE wouldnt have lifted a finger without a gang behind him
Why all Peter himself could do was to cut off an ear that wasnt no
use to anybody What are you tryin to get AT

The Squire had him and paused and stroked his chin to make the ruin
complete Then I reckon youll have to admit he murmured that
while I aint defendin Joe Loudens character it was kind of proper
for him to stand by a feller that wouldnt hear nothin against him
and fought for him as soon as he DID hear it

Eskew Arp rose from his chair and left the hotel It was the only
morning in all the days of the conclave when he was the first to leave

Squire Buckalew looked after the retreating figure total triumph
shining brazenly from his spectacles I expect he explained
modestly to the othersI expect I dont think any more of Joe
Louden than he does and Ill be glad when Canaan sees the last of him
for good but sometimes the temptation to argue with Eskew does lead me
on to kind of git the better of him

When Happy Fear had sufferedwith a giveandtake simplicity of
patiencehis allotment of months in durance and was released and sent
into the streets and sunshine once more he knew that his first duty
lay in the direction of a general apology to Joe But the young man
was no longer at Beaver Beach the redbearded proprietor dwelt alone
there and receiving Happy with scorn and pity directed him to
retrace his footsteps to the town

Ye must have been in the black hole of incarceration indeed if ye
havent heard that Mr Louden has his lawoffice on the Square and his
livinroom behind the office Its in that little brick buildin
straight acrost from the sheriffs door o the jailyeve been
neighbors this long time A hard time the boy had persuadin any one
to rent to him but by payin double the price he got a place at last
Hes a practisin lawyer now praise the Lord And all the boys and
girls of our acquaintance go to him with their troubles Yell see him
with a murder case to try before long as sure as yere not worth yer
salt But I expect ye can still call him by his name of Joe all the
same

It was a bleak and meagre little office into which Mr Fear ushered
himself to offer his amends The cracked plaster of the walls was bare
save for dust there were no shelves the fat brown volumes most of
them fairly new were piled in regular columns upon a cheap pine table
there was but one window smallpaned and shadeless an inner door of
this sad chamber stood half ajar permitting the visitor unreserved
acquaintance with the domestic economy of the tenant for it disclosed
a second room smaller than the office and dependent upon the window
of the latter for air and light Behind a canvas campcot dimly
visible in the obscurity of the inner apartment stood a small
gasstove surmounted by a stewpan from which projected the handle of
a big tin spoon so that it needed no ghost from the dead to whisper
that Joseph Louden attorneyatlaw did his own cooking Indeed he
looked it

Upon the threshold of the second room reposed a small worn
lightbrown scrubbrush of a dog so cosmopolitan in ancestry that his
species was almost as undeterminable as the castiron dogs of the Pike
Mansion He greeted Mr Fear hospitably having been so lately an
offcast of the streets himself that his adoption had taught him to lose
only his old tremors not his hopefulness At the same time Joe rose
quickly from the deal table where he had been working with one hand in
his hair the other splattering ink from a bad pen

Good for you Happy he cried cheerfully I hoped youd come to see
me today Ive been thinking about a job for you

What kind of a job asked the visitor as they shook hands I need
one bad enough but you know there aint nobody in Canaan would gimme
one Joe

Joe pushed him into one of the two chairs which completed the furniture
of his office Yes there is Ive got an idea

First broke in Mr Fear fingering his shapeless hat and fixing his
eyes upon it with embarrassmentfirst lemme say what I come here to
say Iwell His embarrassment increased and he paused rubbing the
hat between his hands

About this job Joe began We can fix it so

No said Happy You lemme go on I didnt mean fer to cause you no
trouble when I lit on that loudmouth Nashville I never thought
theyd git me or youd be dragged in But I jest couldnt stand him
no longer He had me all wore outall evening long ahintin and
sniffin and wearin that kind of a highsmile cause they made so much
fuss over you And then when we got clear in town he come out with it
Said you was too quiet to suit HIMsaid he couldnt see nothin TO
you Well I says to myself jest let him go on jest one more I
says then he gits it And he did Said you tromped on his foot on
purpose said he knowed itwhen the Lordamightiest fool on earth
knows you never tromped on no one Said you was one of the porest
young sports he ever see around a place like the Beach You see he
thought you was jest one of them fool Bloods that come around raisin
a rumpus and didnt know you was our friend and belonged out there
the same as me or Mike hisself Go on I says to myself jest one
more HE better go home to his mamma he says hell git in
trouble if he dont Somebody ll soak him if he hangs around in MY
company _I_ dont like his WAYS Then I HAD to do it There jest
wasnt nothin LEFTbut I wouldnt of done you no harm by it

You didnt do me any harm Happy

I mean your repitation

I didnt have oneso nothing in the world could harm it About your
getting some work now

Ill listen said Happy rather suspiciously

You see Joe went on growing red I need a sort of janitor here

What fer Mr Fear interrupted with some shortness

To look after the place

You mean these two rooms

Theres a stairway too Joe put forth quickly It wouldnt be any
sinecure Happy Youd earn your money dont be afraid of that

Mr Fear straightened up his burden of embarrassment gone from him
transferred to the others shoulders

There always was a yellow streak in you Joe he said firmly
Youre no good as a liar except when youre jokin A lot you need a
janitor You had no business to pay my fine youd ort of let me worked
it out Do you think my eyes aint good enough to see how much you
needed the money most of all right now when youre tryin to git
started If I ever take a cent from you I hope the hand I hold out
fer it ll rot off

Now dont say that Happy

I dont want a job nohow said Mr Fear going to the door I dont
want to work Theres plenty ways fer me to git along without that
But Ive said what I come here to say and Ill say one thing more
Dont you worry about gittin law practice Mike says youre goin to
git all you wantand if there aint no other way why a few of us ll
go out and MAKE some fer ye

These prophecies and promises over which Joe chuckled at first with
his head cocked to one side grew very soon to his amazement to wear
a supernatural similarity to actual fulfilment His friends brought
him their own friends such as had sinned against the laws of Canaan
those under the ban of the sheriff those who had struck in anger
those who had stolen at night those who owed and could not pay those
who lived by the dice and to his other titles to notoriety was added
that of defender of the poor and wicked He found his hands full
especially after winning his first important caseon which occasion
Canaan thought the jury mad and was indignant with the puzzled Judge
who could not see just how it had happened

Joe did not stop at that He kept on winning cases clearing the
innocent and lightening the burdens of the guilty he became the most
dangerous attorney for the defence in Canaan his honorable brethren
accepting the popular view of him held him in personal contempt but
feared him professionally for he proved that he knew more law than
they thought existed nor could any trick himfailing which many
tempers were lost but never Joes His practice was not all criminal
as shown by the peevish outburst of the eminent Buckalew the Squires
nephew esteemed the foremost lawyer in Canaan Before long there
wont be any use trying to foreclose a mortgage or collect a
noteunless this shyster gets himself in jail

The wrath of Judge Martin Pike was augustthere was a kind of
sublimity in its immensenesson a day when it befell that the shyster
stood betwixt him and money

That was a monstrous taskto stand between these two and separate
them to hold back the hand of Martin Pike from what it had reached out
to grasp It was in the matter of some taxtitles which the magnate
had acquired and in court Joe treated the case with such horrifying
simplicity that it seemed almost credible that the great man had
counted upon the ignorance and besottedness of Joes clienta
harddrinking disreputable old farmerto get his land away from him
without paying for it Now as every one knew such a thing to be
ludicrously impossible it was at once noised abroad in Canaan that Joe
had helped to swindle Judge Pike out of a large sum of moneyit was
notorious that the shyster could bamboozle court and jury with his
tricks and it was felt that Joe Louden was getting into very deep
waters indeed THIS was serious if the young man did not LOOK OUT he
might find himself in the penitentiary

The Tocsin paragraphed him with a fine regularity after this usually
opening with a WalrusandtheCarpenter gravity The time has come
when we must speak of a certain matter frankly or At last the time
has arrived when the demoralization of the bar caused by a certain
criminal lawyer must be dealt with as it is and without gloves Once
when Joe had saved a halfwitted negro from the extreme penalty for
murder the Tocsin had declared with great originality This is just
the kind of thing that causes mobs and justifies them If we are to
continue to permit the worst class of malefactors to escape the
consequences of their crimes through the unwholesome dexterities and
the shifty manipulations and technicalities of a certain criminal
lawyer the time will come when an outraged citizenry may take the
enforcement of the law in its own hands Let us call a spade a spade
If Canaans streets ever echo with the tread of a mob the fault lies
upon the head of Joseph Louden who has once more brought about a
miscarriage of justice

Joe did not move into a larger office he remained in the little room
with its one window and its fine view of the jail his clients were
nearly all poor and many of his fees quite literally nominal Tatters
and rags came up the narrow stairway to his doortatters and rags and
pitiful fineries the bleared the sodden the flaunting and rouged
the furtive and wary some in rags some in tags and somethe
sorriestin velvet gowns With these the distressed the
wrongdoers the drunken the dirty and the very poor his work lay
and his days and nights were spent

Ariel had told Roger Tabor that in time Joe might come to be what the
town thought him if it gave him no other chance Only its dinginess
and evil surrounded him no respectable house was open to him the
barroomsexcept that of the National Housewelcomed him gratefully
and admiringly Once he went to church on a pleasant morning when
nice girls wear pretty spring dresses it gave him a thrill of delight
to see them to be near clean good people once more Inadvertently he
took a seat by his stepmother who rose with a slight rustle of silk
and moved to another pew and it happened additionally that this was
the morning that the minister fired by the Tocsins warnings had
chosen to preach on the subject of Joe himself

The outcast returned to his own kind No lady spoke to him upon the
street Mamie Pike had passed him with averted eyes since her first
meeting with him but the shunning and snubbing of a young man by a
pretty girl have never yet if done in a certain way prevented him
from continuing to be in love with her Mamie did it in the certain
way Joe did not wince therefore it hurt all the more for blows from
which one cringes lose much of their force

The town dog had been given a bad name painted solid black from head
to heel He was a storm centre of scandal the entrance to his dingy
stairway was in square view of the National House and the result is
imaginable How many of Joes clients especially those sorriest of
the velvet gowns were conjectured to ascend his stairs for reasons
more convivial than legal Yes he lived with his own kind and so
far as the rest of Canaan was concerned might as well have worn the
scarlet letter on his breast or branded on his forehead

When he went about the streets he was made to feel his condition by the
elaborate avoidance yet furtive attention of every respectable person
he met and when he came home to his small rooms and shut the door
behind him he was as one who has been hissed and shamed in public and
runs to bury his hot face in his pillow He petted his mongrel
extravagantly well he might and would sit with him in his rooms at
night holding long converse with him the two alone together The dog
was not his only confidant There came to be another a more and more
frequent partner to their conversations at last a familiar spirit
This third came from a brown jug which Joe kept on a shelf in his
bedroom a vessel too frequently replenished When the days work was
done he shut himself up drank alone and drank hard Sometimes when the
jug ran low and the night was late he would go out for a walk with his
dog and would awake in his room the next morning not remembering where
he had gone or how he had come home Once after such a lapse of
memory he woke amazed to find himself at Beaver Beach whither he
learned from the redbearded man Happy Fear had brought him having
found him wandering dazedly in a field near by These lapses grew more
frequent until there occurred that which was one of the strange things
of his life

It was a June night a little more than two years after his return to
Canaan and the Tocsin had that day announced the approaching marriage
of Eugene Bantry and his employers daughter Joe ate nothing during
the day and went through his work clumsily visiting the bedroom shelf
at intervals At ten in the evening he went out to have the jug
refilled but from the moment he left his door and the fresh air struck
his face he had no clear knowledge of what he did or of what went on
about him until he woke in his bed the next morning

And yet whatever little part of the soul of him remained that night
still undulled not numbed but alive was in some strange manner
lifted out of its pain towards a strange delight His body was an
automaton his mind in bondage yet there was a still small
consciousness in him which knew that in his wandering something
incredible and unexpected was happening What this was he did not
know could not see though his eyes were open could not have told
himself any more than a baby could tell why it laughs but it seemed
something so beautiful and wonderful that the night became a night of
perfume its breezes bearing the music of harps and violins while
nightingales sang from the maples that bordered the streets of Canaan

THE TRYST

He woke to the light of morning amazed and full of a strange wonder
because he did not know what had amazed him For a little while after
his eyes opened he lay quite motionless then he lifted his head
slightly and shook it with some caution This had come to be custom
The operation assured him of the worst the room swam round him and
with a faint groan he let his head fall back upon the pillow But he
could not sleep again pain stung its way through his heart as memory
began to come back to him not of the preceding nightthat was all
blankbut realization that the girl of whom he had dreamed so long
was to be married That his dreams had been quite hopeless was no balm
to his hurt

A chime of bells sounded from a church steeple across the Square
ringing out in assured righteousness summoning the good people who
maintained them to come and sit beneath them or be taken to task and
they fell so dismally upon Joes ear that he bestirred himself and
rose to the delight of his mongrel who leaped upon him joyfully An
hour later or thereabout the pair emerged from the narrow stairway
and stood for a moment blinking in the fair sunshine apparently
undecided which way to go The church bells were silent there was no
breeze the air trembled a little with the deep pipings of the organ
across the Square and save for that the town was very quiet The
paths which crossed the Courthouse yard were flecked with steady
shadow the strong young foliage of the maples not moving having the
air of observing the Sabbath with propriety There were benches here
and there along the walks and to one of these Joe crossed and sat
down The mongrel at his masters feet rolled on his back in morning
ecstasy ceased abruptly to roll and began to scratch his ear with a
hind foot intently A tiny hand stretched to pat his head and the dog
licked it appreciatively It belonged to a hardwashed young lady of
six in starchy white frills and new pink ribbons who had run ahead
of her mother a belated churchgoer and the mongrel charmed her

Will you give me this dog she asked without any tedious formalities

Involuntarily she departed before receiving a reply The mother a
redfaced matron whom Joe recognized as a sister of Mrs Loudens
consequently his stepaunt swooped at the child with a rush and rustle
of silk and bore her on violently to her duty When they had gone a
little way the matrons voice was heard in sharp reproof the child
held by one wrist and hurried along on tiptoe staring back over one
shoulder at Joe her eyes wide and her mouth the shape of the O she
was ejaculating

The dog looked up with wistful inquiry at his master who cocked an
eyebrow at him in return wearing much the same expression The mother
and child disappeared within the church doors and left the Square to
the two Even the hotel showed no signs of life for the wise men were
not allowed to foregather on Sundays The organ had ceased to stir the
air and all was in quiet yet a quiet which for Louden was not peace
He looked at his watch and without intending it spoke the hour aloud
A quarter past eleven The sound of his own voice gave him a little
shock he rose without knowing why and as he did so it seemed to him
that he heard close to his ear another voice a womans troubled and
insistent but clear and sweet saying

REMEMBER ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON

It was so distinct that he started and looked round Then he laughed
Ill be seeing circus parades next His laughter fled for louder
than the ringing in his ears unmistakably came the strains of a
faraway brass band which had no existence on land or sea or in the
waters under the earth

Here he said to the mongrel We need a walk I think Lets you
and me move on before the camels turn the corner

The music followed him to the street where he turned westward toward
the river and presently as he walked on fanning himself with his
straw hat it faded and was gone But the voice he had heard returned

REMEMBER ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON it said again close to
his ear

This time he did not start All right he answered wiping his
forehead if youll let me alone Ill be there

At a dingy saloon corner near the river a shabby little man greeted
him heartily and petted the mongrel Im mighty glad you didnt go
after all Joe he added with a brightening face

Go where Happy

Mr Fear looked grave Dont you reclect meetin me last night

Louden shook his head No Did I

The others jaw fell and his brow corrugated with selfreproach
Well if that dont show what a thickhead I am I thought ye was all
right er Id gone on with ye Nobody cd a walked straighter ner
talked straighter Said ye was goin to leave Canaan fer good and
didnt want nobody to know it Said ye was goin to take the
levenoclock through train fer the West and told me I couldnt come
to the deepo with ye Said yed had enough o Canaan and of
everything I follered ye part way to the deepo but ye turned and
made a motion fer me to go back and I done it because ye seemed to be
kind of in trouble and I thought yed ruther be by yerself Well
sir its one on me

Not at all said Joe I was all right

Was ye returned the other DO remember do ye

Almost Joe smiled faintly

ALMOST echoed Happy shaking his head seriously I tell ye Joe ef
I was YOU he began slowly then paused and shook his head again He
seemed on the point of delivering some advice but evidently perceiving
the snobbishness of such a proceeding or else convinced by his own
experience of the futility of it he swerved to cheerfulness

I hear the boys is all goin to work hard fer the primaries Mike
says ye got some chances ye dont know about HE swears yell be the
next Mayor of Canaan

Nonsense Folly and nonsense Happy Thats the kind of thing I used
to think when I was a boy But nowpshaw Joe broke off with a tired
laugh Tell them not to waste their time Are you going out to the
Beach this afternoon

The little man lowered his eyes moodily Ill be near there he
said scraping his patched shoe up and down the curbstone That
fellers in town agin

What fellow

Nashville they call him Eds the name he give the hospital
Coryhim that I soaked the night you come back to Canaan Hes after
Claudine to git his evens with me Hes made a raise somewheres and
plays the spender And herwell I reckon shes tired waitin table
at the National House tired o me too I got a hint that theyre
goin out to the Beach together this afternoon

Joe passed his hand wearily over his aching forehead I understand
he said and youd better try to Corys laying for you of course
You say hes after your wife He must have set about it pretty openly
if theyre going to the Beach today for there is always a crowd there
on Sundays Is it hard for you to see why hes doing it Its because
he wants to make you jealous What for So that youll tackle him
again And why does he want that Because hes ready for you

The others eyes suddenly became bloodshot his nostrils expanding
incredibly READY is he He BETTER be ready I

Thats enough Joe interrupted swiftly Well have no talk like
that Ill settle this for you myself You send word to Claudine
that I want to see her at my office tomorrow morning and youyou
stay away from the Beach today Give me your word

Mr Fears expression softened All right Joe he said Ill do
whatever you tell me to Any of us ll do that we sure know whos our
friend

Keep out of trouble Happy Joe turned to go and they shook hands
Good day andkeep out of trouble

When he had gone Mr Fears countenance again gloomed ominously and
shaking his head he ruminatively entered an adjacent bar through the
alley door

The Main Street bridge was an oldfashioned wooden covered one
dustcolored and very narrow squarely framing the fair open country
beyond for the town had never crossed the river Joe found the cool
shadow in the bridge gracious to his hot brow and through the slender
chinks of the worn flooring he caught bright glimpses of running water
When he came out of the other end he felt enough refreshed to light a
cigar

Well here I am he said Across Main Street bridgeand it must be
getting on toward noon He spoke almost with the aspect of daring
and immediately stood still listening REMEMBER he ventured to
repeat again daring REMEMBER ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON
And again he listened Then he chuckled faintly with relief for the
voice did not return Thank God Ive got rid of that he whispered
And of the circus band too

A dust road turned to the right following the river and shaded by big
sycamores on the bank the mongrel intensely preoccupied with this
road scampered away his nose to the ground Good enough said the
master Lead on and Ill come after you

But he had not far to follow The chase led him to a halfhollow log
which lay on a low grassgrown levee above the stream where the dogs
interest in the pursuit became vivid temporarily however for after a
few minutes of agitated investigation he was seized with indifference
to the whole world panted briefly slept Joe sat upon the log which
was in the shade and smoked

REMEMBER He tried it once more ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT
NOON Safety still the voice came not But the sound of his own
repetition of the words brought him an eerie tremor for the mist of a
memory came with it nothing tangible nothing definite but something
very far away and shadowy yet just poignant enough to give him a queer
feeling that he was really keeping an appointment here Was it with
some watersprite that would rise from the river Was it with a dryad
of the sycamores He knew too well that he might expect strange
fancies to get hold of him this morning and as this one grew
uncannily stronger he moved his head briskly as if to shake it off
The result surprised him the fancy remained but his headache and
dizziness had left him

A breeze wandered up the river and touched the leaves and grass to
life Sparrows hopped and chirped in the branches absurdly surprised
without doubt having concluded in the Sunday stillness that the world
would drowse forever and the mongrel lifted his head blinked at them
hopelessly wishing they would alight near him scratched his ear with
the manner of one who has neglected such matters overlong reversed his
position slept again The young corn deep green in the bottomland
moved with a staccato flurry and the dust ghost of a mad whirling
dervish sped up the main road to vanish at the bridge in a climax of
lunacy The stirring air brought a smell of blossoms the distance took
on faint lavender hazes which blended the outlines of the fields lying
like square coverlets upon the long slope of rising ground beyond the
bottomland and empurpled the blue woodland shadows of the groves

For the first time it struck Joe that it was a beautiful day and it
came to him that a beautiful day was a thing which nothing except
death sickness or imprisonment could take from himnot even the ban
of Canaan Unforewarned music sounded in his ears again but he did
not shrink from it now this was not the circus band he had heard as he
left the Square but a melody like a faraway serenade at night as of
the horns of elfland faintly blowing and he closed his eyes with
the sweetness of it

Go ahead he whispered Do that all you want to If youll keep it
up like this awhile Ill follow with Little Brown Jug How I Love
Thee It seems to pay after all

The welcome strains however were but the prelude to a harsher sound
which interrupted and annihilated them the Courthouse bell clanging
out twelve All right said Joe Its noon and Im across Main
Street bridge

He opened his eyes and looked about him whimsically Then he shook his
head again

A lady had just emerged from the bridge and was coming toward him

It would be hard to get at Joes first impressions of her We can find
conveyance for only the broadest and heaviest Ancient and modern
instances multiply the case of the sleeper who dreams out a long story
in accurate color and fine detail a tale of years in the opening and
shutting of a door So with Joseph in the brief space of the ladys
approach And with him as with the sleeper it must have beenin
fact it was in his recollections latera blur of emotion

At first sight of her perhaps it was preeminently the shock of seeing
anything so exquisite where he had expected to see nothing at all For
she was exquisitehorrid as have been the uses of the word its best
and truest belong to her she was that and much more from the ivory
ferrule of the parasol she carried to the light and slender footprint
she left in the dust of the road Joe knew at once that nothing like
her had ever before been seen in Canaan

He had little knowledge of the millinery arts and he needed none to
see the harmonyharmony like that of the day he had discovered a
little while ago Her dress and hat and gloves and parasol showed a
pale lavender overtint like that which he had seen overspreading the
western slope Afterward he discovered that the gloves she wore that
day were gray and that her hat was for the most part white The
charm of fabric and tint belonging to what she wore was no shame to
her not being of primal importance beyond herself it was but the
expression of her daintiness and the adjunct of it She was tall but
if Joe could have spoken or thought of her as slender he would have
been capable of calling her lips red in which case he would not have
been Joe and would have been as far from the truth as her lips were
from red or as her supreme delicateness was from mere slenderness

Under the summer hat her very dark hair swept back over her temples
with something near trimness in the extent to which it was withheld
from being fluffy It may be that this approach to trimness which
was after all only a sort of coquetry with trimness is the true key
to the mystery of the vision of the lady who appeared to Joe Let us
say that she suppressed everything that went beyond grace that the
hint of floridity was abhorrent to her Trim is as clumsy as
slender she had escaped from the trimness of girlhood as wholly as
she had gone through its coltishness Exquisite Let us go back to
Joes own blurred first thought of her and be content with that

She was to pass himso he thoughtand as she drew nearer his breath
came faster

REMEMBER ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON Was THIS the fay of
whom the voice had warned him With that there befell him the mystery
of last night He did not remember but it was as if he lived again
dimly the highest hour of happiness in a life a thousand years ago
perfume and music roses nightingales and plucked harpstrings Yes
something wonderful was happening to him

She had stopped directly in front of him stopped and stood looking at
him with her clear eyes He did not lift his own to hers he had long
experience of the averted gaze of women but it was not only that a
great shyness beset him He had risen and removed his hat trying
ineffectually not to clear his throat his everyday sense urging
upon him that she was a stranger in Canaan who had lost her waythe
preposterousness of any ones losing the way in Canaan not just now
appealing to his everyday sense

Can Ican I he stammered blushing miserably meaning to finish
with direct you or show you the way

Then he looked at her again and saw what seemed to him the strangest
sight of his life The ladys eyes had filled with tearsfilled and
overfilled Ill sit here on the log with you she said And her
voice was the voice which he had heard saying REMEMBER ACROSS MAIN
STREET BRIDGE AT NOON

WHAT he gasped

You dont need to dust it she went on tremulously And even then
he did not know who she was



XI

WHEN HALFGODS GO

There was a silence for if the dazzled young man could have spoken at
all He could have found nothing to say and perhaps the lady would
not trust her own voice just then His eyes had fallen again he was
too dazed and in truth too panicstricken now to look at her
though if he had been quite sure that she was part of a wonderful dream
he might have dared She was seated beside him and had handed him her
parasol in a little way which seemed to imply that of course he had
reached for it so that it was to be seen how used she was to have all
tiny things done for her though this was not then of his tremulous
observing He did perceive however that he was to furl the dainty
thing he pressed the catch and let down the top timidly as if
fearing to break or tear it and as it closed held near his face he
caught a very faint sweet spicy emanation from it like wild roses and
cinnamon

He did not know her but his timidity and a strange little choke in his
throat the sudden fright which had seized upon him were not caused by
embarrassment He had no thought that she was one he had known but
could not for the moment recall there was nothing of the awkwardness
of that no he was overpowered by the miracle of this meeting And
yet white with marvelling he felt it to be so much more touchingly a
great happiness than he had ever known that at first it was
inexpressibly sad

At last he heard her voice again shaking a little as she said

I am glad you remembered

Remembered what he faltered

Then you dont she cried And yet you came

Came here do you mean

Yesnow at noon

Ah he half whispered unable to speak aloud Was it you who
saidwho said Remember Acrossacross

Across Main Street bridge at noon she finished for him gently
Yes

He took a deep breath in the wonder of it Where was it you said
that he asked slowly Was it last night

Dont you even know that you came to meet me

_I_came toto meetyou

She gave a little pitying cry very near a sob seeing his utter
bewilderment

It was like the strangest dream in the world she said You were at
the station when I came last night You dont remember at all

His eyes downcast his face burning hotly he could only shake his head

Yes she continued I thought no one would be there for I had not
written to say what train I should take but when I stepped down from
the platform you were standing there though you didnt see me at
first not until I had called your name and ran to you You said
Ive come to meet you but you said it queerly I thought And then
you called a carriage for me but you seemed so strange you couldnt
tell how you knew that I was coming andand then II understood you
werent yourself You were very quiet but I knew I knew So I made
you get into the carriageandand

She faltered to a stop and with that shame itself brought him
courage he turned and faced her She had lifted her handkerchief to
her eyes but at his movement she dropped it and it was not so much
the delicate loveliness of her face that he saw then as the tears upon
her cheeks

Ah poor boy she cried I knew I knew

Youyou took me home

You told me where you lived she answered Yes I took you home

I dont understand he stammered huskily I dont understand

She leaned toward him slightly looking at him with great intentness

You didnt know me last night she said Do you know me now

For answer he could only stare at her dumfounded He lifted an
unsteady hand toward her appealingly But the manner of the lady as
she saw the truth underwent an April change She drew back lightly he
was favored with the most delicious low laugh he had ever heard and
by some magic whisk which she accomplished there was no sign of tears
about her

Ah Im glad youre the same Joe she said You never would or
could pretend very well Im glad youre the same and Im glad Ive
changed though that isnt why you have forgotten me Youve forgotten
me because you never thought of me Perhaps I should not have known
you if you had changed a great dealas I have

He started leaning back from her

Ah she laughed Thats it That funny little twist of the head
you always had like alike awell you know I must have told you a
thousand times that it was like a nice friendly puppy so why shouldnt
I say so now And your eyebrows When you look like that nobody
could ever forget you Joe

He rose from the log and the mongrel leaped upon him uproariously
thinking they were to go home belike to food

The lady laughed again Dont let him spoil my parasol And I must
warn you now Never never TREAD ON MY SKIRT Im very irritable
about such things

He had taken three or four uncertain backward steps from her She sat
before him radiant with laughter the loveliest creature he had ever
seen but between him and this charming vision there swept through the
warm scented June air a veil of snow like a driven fog and half
obscured in the heart of it a young girl stood kneedeep in a drift
piled against an old picket gate her black waterproof and shabby
skirt flapping in the blizzard like torn sails one of her hands
outstretched toward him her startled eyes fixed on his

And oh how like you said the lady how like you and nobody else
in the world Joe to have a yellow dog

ARIEL TABOR

His lips formed the words without sound

Isnt it about time she said Are strange ladies in the HABIT of
descending from trains to take you home


Once upon a white morning long ago the sensational progress of a
certain youth up Main Street had stirred Canaan But that day was as
nothing to this Mr Bantry had left temporary paralysis in his wake
but in the case of the two young people who passed slowly along the
street today it was petrifaction which seemingly threatened in
several instances most notably that of Mr Arp to become permanent

The lower portion of the street lined with three and four story
buildings of brick and stone rather grim and hot facades under the
midday sun afforded little shade to the churchcomers who were
working homeward in processional little groups and clumps none walking
fast though none with the appearance of great leisure since neither
rate of progress would have been esteemed befitting the day The
growth of Canaan steady though never startling had left almost all
of the churches downtown and Main Street the principal avenue of
communication between them and the residence section So today
the intermittent procession stretched along the new cement sidewalks
from a little below the Square to Upper Main Street where maples lined
the thoroughfare and the mansions of the affluent stood among pleasant
lawns and shrubberies It was late for this had been a communion
Sunday and those far in advance who had already reached the pretty
and shady part of the street were members of the churches where
services had been shortest though few in the long parade looked as if
they had been attending anything very short and many heads of families
were crisp in their replies to the theological inquiries of their
offspring The men imparted largely a gloom to the itinerant
concourse most of them wearing hot long black coats and having wilted
their collars the ladies relieving this gloom somewhat by the lighter
tints of their garments the spickandspan little girls relieving it
greatly by their white dresses and their faces the latter bright with
the hope of Sunday icecream while the boys experiencing some solace
in that they were finally out where a person could at least scratch
himself if he had to yet oppressed by the decorous necessities of the
day marched along furtively planning behind imperturbably secretive
countenances various means for the later dispersal of an odious
monotony

Usually the conversation of this long string of the homewardbound was
not too frivolous or worldly nay it properly inclined to discussion
of the sermon that is praise of the sermon with here and there a
mild Ididntlikehissaying or so and its lighter aspects were apt
to concern the next Social or various pleasurable schemes for the
raising of funds to help the heathen the quite worthy poor or the
church

This was the serious and seemly parade the propriety of whose behavior
was today almost disintegrated when the lady of the bridge walked up
the street in the shadow of a lacy lavender parasol carried by Joseph
Louden The congregation of the church across the Square that to
which Joes stepaunt had been late was just debouching almost in
mass upon Main Street when these two went by It is not quite the
truth to say that all except the children came to a dead halt but it
is not very far from it The air was thick with subdued exclamations
and whisperings

Here is no mystery Joe was probably the only person of respectable
derivation in Canaan who had not known for weeks that Ariel Tabor was
on her way home And the news that she had arrived the night before
had been widely disseminated on the way to church entering church IN
church even so and coming out of church An account of her house
in the Avenue Henri Martin and of her portrait in the Salona
mysterious business to many and not lacking in grandeur for thathad
occupied two columns in the Tocsin on a day some months before when
Joe had found himself inimically headlined on the first page and had
dropped the paper without reading further Ariels name had been in
the mouth of Canaan for a long time unfortunately for Joe however
not in the mouth of that Canaan which held converse with him

Joe had not known her The women recognized her infallibly at first
glance even those who had quite forgotten her And the women told
their men Hence the unSundaylike demeanor of the procession for
few towns hold it more unseemly to stand and stare at passersby
especially on the SabbathBUT Ariel Tabor returnedand walking
withWITH JOE LOUDEN 

A low but increasing murmur followed the two as they proceeded It ran
up the street ahead of them people turned to look back and paused so
that they had to walk round one or two groups They had also to walk
round Norbert Flitcroft which was very like walking round a group He
was one of the few he was waddling home alone who did not identify
Miss Tabor and her effect upon him was extraordinary His mouth
opened and he gazed stodgily his widening eyes like sundogs coming
out of a fog He did not recognize her escort did not see him at all
until they had passed after which Mr Flitcroft experienced a few
moments of trance came out of it stricken through and through felt
nervously of his tie resolutely fell in behind the heeling mongrel and
followed at a distance of some forty paces determined to learn what
household this heavenly visitor honored and thrilling with the
intention to please that same household with his own presence as soon
and as often as possible

Ariel flushed a little when she perceived the extent of their
conspicuousness but it was not the blush that Joe remembered had
reddened the tanned skin of old for her brownness had gone long ago
though it had not left her merely pink and white This was a delicate
rosiness rising from her cheeks to her temples as the earliest dawn
rises If there had been many words left in Joe he would have called
it a divine blush it fascinated him and if anything could have
deepened the glamour about her it would have been this blush He did
not understand it but when he saw it he stumbled

Those who gaped and stared were for him only blurs in the background
truly he saw men as trees walking and when it became necessary to
step out to the curb in passing some clump of people it was to him as
if Ariel and he enchantedly alone were working their way through
underbrush in the woods

He kept trying to realize that this lady of wonder was Ariel Tabor but
he could not he could not connect the shabby Ariel whom he had
treated as one boy treats another with this young woman of the world
He had always been embarrassed himself and ashamed of her when
anything she did made him remember that after all she was a girl as
on the day he ran away when she kissed a lock of his hair escaping
from the bandage With that recollection even his ears grew red it
did not seem probable that it would ever happen again The next
instant he heard himself calling her Miss Tabor

At this she seemed amused You ought to have called me that years
ago she said for all you knew me

I did know herYOU I mean he answered I used to know nearly
everything you were going to say before you said it It seems strange
now

Yes she interrupted It does seem strange now

Somehow he went on I doubt if now Id know

Somehow she echoed with fine gravity I doubt it too

Although he had so dim a perception of the staring and whispering which
greeted and followed them Ariel of course was thoroughly aware of
it though the only sign she gave was the slight blush which very soon
disappeared That people turned to look at her may have been not
altogether a novelty a girl who had learned to appear unconscious of
the Continental stare the following gaze of the boulevards the frank
glasses of the Costanza in Rome was not ill equipped to face Main
Street Canaan even as it was today

Under the sycamores before they started they had not talked a great
deal there had been long silences almost all her questions concerning
the period of his runaway absence she appeared to know and to
understand everything which had happened since his return to the town
He had not in his turn reached the point where he would begin to
question her he was too breathless in his consciousness of the
marvellous present hour She had told him of the death of Roger Tabor
the year before Poor man she said gently he lived to see how
the other fellows did it at last and everybody liked him He was
very happy over there

After a little while she had said that it was growing close upon
lunchtime she must be going back

Thenthengoodbye he replied ruefully

Why

Im afraid you dont understand It wouldnt do for you to be seen
with me Perhaps though you do understand Wasnt that why you
asked me to meet you out here beyond the bridge

In answer she looked at him full and straight for three seconds then
threw back her head and closed her eyes tight with laughter Without a
word she took the parasol from him opened it herself placed the
smooth white coral handle of it in his hand and lightly took his arm
There was no further demur on the part of the young man He did not
know where she was going he did not ask

Soon after Norbert turned to follow them they came to the shady part
of the street where the town in summer was like a grove Detachments
from the procession had already here and there turned in at the
various gates Nobody however appeared to have gone indoors except
for fans armed with which immediately to return to rockers upon the
shaded verandas As Miss Tabor and Joe went by the rockingchairs
stopped the fans poised motionless and perspiring old gentlemen
wiping their necks paused in arrested attitudes

Once Ariel smiled politely not at Mr Louden and inclined her head
twice with the result that the latter after thinking for a time of
how gracefully she did it and how pretty the top of her hat was became
gradually conscious of a meaning in her action that she had bowed to
some one across the street He lifted his hat about four minutes
late and discovered Mamie Pike and Eugene upon the opposite pavement
walking home from church together Joe changed color

There just over the way was she who had been in his first youth the
fairy child the little princess playing in the palace yard and always
afterward his lady of dreams his fair unreachable moon And Joe
seeing her today changed color that was all He had passed Mamie in
the street only a week before and she had seemed all that she had
always seemed today an incomprehensible and subtle change had
befallen hera change so mystifying to him that for a moment he almost
doubted that she was Mamie Pike It came to him with a breathtaking
shock that her face lacked a certain vivacity of meaning that its
sweetness was perhaps too placid that there would have been a deeper
goodness in it had there been any hint of daring Astonishing questions
assailed him startled him could it be true that after all there
might be some day too much of her Was her amber hair a little
tooFLUFFY Was something the matter with her dress Everything she
wore had always seemed so beautiful Where had the exquisiteness of it
gone For there was surely no exquisiteness about it now It was
incredible that any one could so greatly alter in the few days elapsed
since he had seen her

Strange matters Mamie had never looked prettier

At the sound of Ariels voice he emerged from the profundities of his
psychic enigma with a leap

She is lovelier than ever isnt she

Yes indeed he answered blankly

Would you still risk she began smiling but apparently thinking
better of it changed her question What is the name of your dog Mr
Louden You havent told me

Oh hes just a yellow dog he evaded unskilfully

YOUNG MAN she said sharply

Well he admitted reluctantly I call him Speck for short

And what for long I want to know his real name

Its mighty inappropriate because were fond of each other said
Joe but when I picked him up he was so yellow and so thin and so
creeping and so scared that I christened him Respectability

She broke into light laughter stopped short in the midst of it and
became grave Ah youve grown bitter she said gently

No no he protested I told you I liked him

She did not answer

They were now opposite the Pike Mansion and to his surprise she
turned indicating the way by a touch upon his sleeve and crossed the
street toward the gate which Mamie and Eugene had entered Mamie
after exchanging a word with Eugene upon the steps was already
hurrying into the house

Ariel paused at the gate as if waiting for Joe to open it

He cocked his head his higher eyebrow rose and the distorted smile
appeared I dont believe wed better stop here he said The last
time I tried it I was expunged from the face of the universe

Dont you know she cried Im staying here Judge Pike has charge
of all my property he was the administrator or something Then
seeing him chopfallen and aghast she went on Of course you dont
know You dont know anything about me You havent even asked

Youre going to live HERE he gasped

Will you come to see me she laughed Will you come this afternoon

He grew white You know I cant he said

You came here once You risked a good deal then just to see Mamie
dance by a window Dont you dare a little for an old friend

All right he gulped Ill try

Mr Bantry had come down to the gate and was holding it open his eyes
fixed upon Ariel within them a rising glow An impression came to Joe
afterward that his stepbrother had looked very handsome

Possibly you remember me Miss Tabor said Eugene in a deep and
impressive voice lifting his hat We were neighbors I believe in
the old days

She gave him her hand in a fashion somewhat mannerly favoring him with
a bright negligent smile Oh quite she answered turning again to
Joe as she entered the gate Then I shall expect you

Ill try said Joe Ill try

He stumbled away Respectability and he together
 interfering alarmingly with the comfort of
Mr Flitcroft who had stopped in the middle of the pavement to stare
glassily at Ariel Eugene accompanied the latter into the house and
Joe looking back understood Mamie had sent his stepbrother to
bring Ariel inand to keep him from following

This afternoon The thought took away his breath and he became
paler

The Pike brougham rolled by him and Sam Warden from the box favored
his old friend upon the pavement with a liberal display of the whites
of his eyes The Judge evidently had been detained after
serviceswithout doubt a meeting of the church officials Mrs Pike
blinking and frightened sat at her husbands side agreeing feebly
with the bullbass which rumbled out of the open window of the
brougham I want orthodox preaching in MY church and by God madam
Ill have it That fellow has got to go Joe took off his hat and
wiped his brow



XII

TO REMAIN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IS NOT ALWAYS A VICTORY

Mamie waiting just inside the door as Ariel and Eugene entered gave
the visitor a pale greeting and a moment later hearing the wheels of
the brougham crunch the gravel of the carriagedrive hurried away
down the broad hall and disappeared Ariel dropped her parasol upon a
marbletopped table near the door and removing her gloves drifted
into a room at the left where a grand piano found shelter beneath
crimson plush After a moment of contemplation she pushed back the
coverlet and seating herself upon the plushcovered pianostool to
match let her fingers run up and down the keyboard once and fall
listlessly in her lap as she gazed with deep interest at three
lifesized colored photographs in carved gilt frames upon the wall
she was facing Judge Pike Mamie and Mrs Pike with her rubies

Please dont stop playing Miss Tabor said a voice behind her She
had not observed that Eugene had followed her into the room

Very well if you like she answered looking up to smile absently at
him And she began to play a rakish little air which composed by some
rattlebrain at a cafe table had lately skipped out of the Moulin
Rouge to disport itself over Paris She played it slowly in the minor
with elfish pathos while he leaned upon the piano his eyes fixed upon
her fingers which bore few rings none he observed with an
unreasonable pleasure upon the third finger of the left hand

Its one of those simpler Grieg things isnt it he said sighing
gently I care for Grieg

Would you mind its being Chaminade she returned dropping her eyes
to cloak the sin

Ah no I recognize it now replied Eugene He appeals to me even
more than Grieg

At this she glanced quickly up at him but more quickly down again and
hastened the time emphatically swinging the little air into the major

Do you play the Pilgrims Chorus

She shook her head

Vous name pas Wagner inquired Eugene leaning toward her

Oh yes she answered bending her head far over so that her face was
concealed from him except the chin which he saw with a thrill of
inexplicable emotion was trembling slightly There were some small
white flowers upon her hat and these shook too

She stopped playing abruptly rose from the stool and crossed the room
to a large mahogany chair upholstered in red velvet and of hybrid
construction possessing both rockers and legs She had moved in a way
which prevented him from seeing her face but he was certain of her
agitation and strangely glad while curious tremulous halfthoughts
edged with prophecy bubbled to the surface of his consciousness

When she turned to him he was surprised to see that she looked
astonishingly happy almost as if she had been struggling with joy
instead of pain

This chair she said sinking into it makes me feel at home

Naturally he could not understand

Because she explained I once thought I was going to live in it
It has been reupholstered but I should know it if I met in anywhere in
the world

How very odd exclaimed Eugene staring

I settled here in pioneer days she went on tapping the arms lightly
with her fingertips It was the last dance I went to in Canaan

I fear the town was very provincial at that time he returned having
completely forgotten the occasion she mentioned therefore wishing to
shift the subject I fear you may still find it so There is not
much here that one is in sympathy with intellectuallyfew people
really of the world

Few people I suppose you mean she said softly with a look that
went deep enough into his eyes few people who really understand one

Eugene had seated himself on the sill of an open window close by
There has been he answered with the ghost of a sigh no one

She turned her head slightly away from him apparently occupied with a
loose thread in her sleeve There were no loose threads it was an old
habit of hers which she retained I suppose she murmured in a
voice as low as his had been that a man of your sort might find
Canaan rather lonely and sad

It HAS been Whereupon she made him a laughing little bow

You are sure you complain of Canaan

Yes he exclaimed You dont know what it is to live here

I think I do I lived here seventeen years

Oh yes he began to object as a child but

Have you any recollection she interrupted of the day before your
brother ran away Of coming home for vacationI think it was your
first year in collegeand intervening between your brother and me in a
snowfight

For a moment he was genuinely perplexed then his face cleared
Certainly he said I found him bullying you and gave him a good
punishing for it

Is that all you remember

Yes he replied honestly Wasnt that all

Quite she smiled her eyes half closed Except that I went home
immediately afterward

Naturally said Eugene My stepbrother wasnt very much chevalier
sans peur et sans reproche Ah I should like to polish up my French a
little Would you mind my asking you to read a bit with me some
little thing of Daudets if you care for him in the original An
hour now and then perhaps

Mamie appeared in the doorway and Eugene rose swiftly I have been
trying to persuade Miss Tabor he explained with something too much
of laughter to play again You heard that little thing of
Chaminades

Mamie did not appear to hear him she entered breathlessly and there
was no color in her cheeks Ariel she exclaimed I dont want you
to think Im a talebearer

Oh my dear Ariel said with a gesture of deprecation

No Miss Pike went on all in one breath but Im afraid you will
think it because papa knows and he wants to see you

What is it that he knows

That you were walking with Joseph Louden This was as if she had
said That you poisoned your mother I DIDNT tell him but when
we saw you with him I was troubled and asked Eugene what Id better
do because Eugene always knows what is best Mr Bantrys
expression despite this tribute was not happy And he advised me
to tell mamma about it and leave it in her hands But she always tells
papa everything

Certainly that is understood said Ariel slowly turning to smile
at Eugene

And she told him this right away Mamie finished

Why shouldnt she if it is of the slightest interest to him

The daughter of the house exhibited signs of consternation He wants
to see you she repeated falteringly Hes in the library

Having thus discharged her errand she hastened to the frontdoor
which had been left open and out to the steps evidently with the
intention of removing herself as soon and as far as possible from the
vicinity of the library

Eugene visibly perturbed followed her to the doorway of the room and
paused

Do you know the way he inquired with a note of solemnity

Where Ariel had not risen

To the library

Of course she said beaming upon him I was about to ask you if
you wouldnt speak to the Judge for me This is such a comfortable old
friend this chair

Speak to him for you repeated the nonplussed Eugene

She nodded cheerfully If I may trouble you Tell him certainly I
shall be glad to see him

He threw a piteous glance after Mamie who was now as he saw through
the open door out upon the lawn and beyond easy hailing distance
When he turned again to look at Ariel he discovered that she had
shifted the position of her chair slightly and was gazing out of the
window with every appearance of cheerful meditation She assumed so
unmistakably that he had of course gone on her mission that dismayed
and his soul quaking he could find neither an alternative nor words to
explain to this dazzling lady that not he nor any other could bear such
a message to Martin Pike

Eugene went There was nothing else to do and he wished with every
step that the distance to the portals of the library might have been
greater

In whatever guise he delivered the summons it was perfectly
efficacious A door slammed a heavy and rapid tread was heard in the
hall and Ariel without otherwise moving turned her head and offered
a brilliant smile of greeting

It was good of you she said as the doorway filled with red
imperial wrath to wish to have a little chat with me Im anxious
of course to go over my affairs with you and last night after my
journey I was too tired But now we might begin not in detail of
course just yet That will do for later when Ive learned more about
business

The great one had stopped on the threshold

Madam he began coldly when I say my library I mean my

Oh yes she interrupted with amiable weariness I know You mean
you keep all the papers and books of the estate in there but I think
wed better put them off for a few days

Im not talking about the estate he exclaimed What I want to talk
to you about is being seen with Joseph Louden

Yes she nodded brightly Thats along the line we must take up
first

Yes it is He hurled his bullbass at her You knew everything
about him and his standing in this community I know you did because
Mrs Pike told me you asked all about him from Mamie after you came
last night and see here dont you

Oh but I knew before that she laughed I had a correspondent in
Canaan one who has always taken a great interest in Mr Louden I
asked Miss Pike only to get her own point of view

I want to tell you madam he shouted coming toward her that no
member of my household

Thats another point we must take up today Im glad you remind me of
it she said thoughtfully yet with so magically compelling an
intonation that he stopped his shouting in the middle of a word
stopped with an apoplectic splutter We must arrange to put the old
house in order at once

Well arrange nothing of the sort he responded after a moment of
angry silence Youre going to stay right here

Ah I know your hospitality she bowed graciously But of course I
must not tax it too far And about Mr Louden As I said I want to
speak to you about him

Yes he intervened harshly So do I and Im going to do it quick
Youll find

Again she mysteriously baffled him Hes a dear old friend of mine
you know and I have made up my mind that we both need his help you
and I

What

Yes she continued calmly in a business way I mean I know you
have great interests in a hundred directions all more important than
mine it isnt fair that you should bear the whole burden of my
affairs and I think it will be best to retain Mr Louden as my man of
business He could take all the cares of the estate off your
shoulders

Martin Pike spoke no word but he looked at her strangely and she
watched him with sudden keenness leaning forward in her chair her
gaze alert but quiet fixed on the dilating pupils of his eyes He
seemed to become dizzy and the choleric scarlet which had overspread
his broad face and big neck faded splotchily

Still keeping her eyes upon him she went on I havent asked him yet
and so I dont know whether or not hell consent but I think it
possible that he may come to see me this afternoon and if he does we
can propose it to him together and go over things a little

Judge Pike recovered his voice Hell get a warm welcome he
promised huskily if he sets foot on my premises

You mean you prefer I shouldnt receive him here She nodded
pleasantly Then certainly I shall not Such things are much better
for offices you are quite right

Youll not see him at all

Ah Judge Pike she lifted her hand with gentle deprecation dont
you understand that we cant quite arrange that You see Mr Louden
is even an older friend of mine than you are and so I must trust his
advice about such things more than yours Of course if he too should
think it better for me not to see him

The Judge advanced toward her Im tired of this he began in a
loud voice Im

She moved as if to rise but he had come very close leaning above her
one arm outstretched and at the end of it a heavy forefinger which he
was shaking at her so that it was difficult to get out of her chair
without pushing him awaya feat apparently impossible Ariel Tabor
in rising placed her hand upon his outstretched arm quite as if he
had offered it to assist her he fell back a step in complete
astonishment she rose quickly and released his arm

Thank you she said beamingly Its quite all my fault that youre
tired Ive been thoughtless to keep you so long and you have been
standing too She swept lightly and quickly to the door where she
paused gathering her skirts I shall not detain you another instant
And if Mr Louden comes this afternoon Ill remember Ill not let
him come in of course It will be perhaps pleasanter to talk over my
proposition as we walk

There was a very faint spicy odor like wild roses and cinnamon left in
the room where Martin Pike stood alone staring whitely at the open
doorway

THE WATCHER AND THE WARDEN

There was a custom of Canaan timeworn and seldom honored in the
breach which put Ariel that afternoon in easy possession of a coign
of vantage commanding the front gate The heavy Sunday dinner was
finished in silence on the part of Judge Pike deafening about three
oclock and soon after Mamie tossed a number of cushions out upon
the stoop between the castiron dogsSam Warden having previously
covered the steps with a rug and placed several garden chairs near by
on the grass These simple preparations concluded Eugene sprawled
comfortably upon the rug and Mamie seated herself near him while
Ariel wandered with apparent aimlessness about the lawn followed by
the gaze of Mr Bantry until Miss Pike begged her a little
petulantly to join them

She came looking about her dreamily and touching to her lips now and
then with an absent air a clover blossom she had found in the longer
grass against the fence She stopped to pat the neck of one of the
castiron deer and with grave eyes proffered the clovertop first for
inspection then as food There were those in the world who seeing
her might have wondered that the deer did not play Galatea and come to
life

No she said aloud to the steadfast head You wont What a
mistake to be made of castiron She smiled and nodded to a clump of
lilacbushes near a cedartree and to nothing elseso far as Eugene
and Mamie could seethen walked thoughtfully to the steps

Who in the world were you speaking to asked Mamie curiously

That deer

But you bowed to some one

Oh that Ariel lifted her eyebrowsthat was your father Didnt
you see him

No

I believe you cant from here after all said Ariel slowly He is
sitting upon a rustic bench between the bushes and the cedartree
quite near the gate No you couldnt see him from here youd have to
go as far as the deer at least and even then you might not notice
him unless you looked for him He has a booka Bible I thinkbut I
dont think he is reading

He usually takes a nap on Sunday afternoons said Mamie

I dont think he will today Ariel looked at Eugene who avoided
her clear gaze He has the air of having settled himself to stay for
a long time perhaps until evening

She had put on her hat after dinner and Mamie now inquired if she
would not prefer to remove it offering to carry it indoors for her
to Ariels room to insure its safety You look so sort of temporary
wearing it she urged as if you were only here for a little while
Its the loveliest hat I ever saw and so fragile too but Ill take
care

Ariel laughed leaned over and touched the others hand lightly It
isnt that dear

What is it then Mamie beamed out into a joyful smile She had
felt sure that she could not understand Ariel was indeed afraid of
her and she found herself astonishingly pleased to be called dear
and delighted with the little familiarity of the handtap Her feeling
toward the visitor who was so her father had announced to become a
permanent member of the household had been until now undefined She
had been on her guard watching for some sign of conscious
superiority in this lady who had been so long overseas not knowing
what to make of her though thrown by the contents of her trunks into
a wistfulness which would have had something of rapture in it had she
been sure that she was going to like Ariel She had gone to the
latters room before church and had perceived uneasily that it had
become even by the process of unpacking the prettiest room she had
ever seen Mrs Warden wife of Sam and handmaiden of the mansion
was assisting alternately faint and vociferous with marvelling Mamie
feared that Ariel might be a little overpowering

With the word dear that is of course with the way it was spoken
and with the touch upon the hand it was all suddenly settled she
would not understand Ariel alwaysthat was clearbut they would like
each other

I am wearing my hat answered Ariel because at any moment I may
decide to go for a long walk

Oh I hope not said Mamie There are sure to be people a few
still come even though Im an engaged girl I expect thats just to
console me though she added smiling over this worn quip of the
betrothed and shaking her head at Eugene who grew red and coughed
Therell be plenty today but they wont be here to see me Its
you Ariel and theyd be terribly disappointed if you werent here I
shouldnt wonder if the whole town came its curious enough about you

Canaan at least that part of it which Mamie meant when she said the
whole town already offered testimony to her truthfulness Two
gentlemen aged nine and eleven and clad in white sailor suits were
at that moment grooving their cheeks between the round pickets of the
gate They had come from the house across the street evidently
stimulated by the conversation at their own recent dinnertable they
wore a few deposits such as are left by chocolatecake and the motive
of their conduct became obvious when upon being joined by a person
from next door a starched and frilled person of the opposite sex but
sympathetic age one of them waggled a forefinger through the gate at
Ariel and a voice was heard in explanation

THATS HER

There was a rustle in the lilacbushes near the cedartree the three
small heads turned simultaneously in that direction something terrific
was evidently seen and with a horrified OOOH the trio skedaddled
headlong

They were but the gay vanguard of the life which the street quite dead
through the Sunday dinnerhour presently took on Young couples with
their progeny began to appear returning from the weekly reunion Sunday
dinner with relatives young people meditative until they reached the
Pike Mansion the wives fanning themselves or shooing the
totsabletowalk ahead of them while the husbands wearing long
coats satin ties and showing dust upon their blazing shoes
invariably pushed the perambulators Most of these passersby
exchanged greetings with Mamie and Eugene and all of them looked hard
at Ariel as long as it was possible

And now the young men of the town laboriously arranged as to apparel
began to appear on the street in small squads making their Sunday
rounds the youngest working in phalanxes of threes and fours those
somewhat older inclining to move in pairs the eldest such as were now
beginning to be considered middleaged beaux or by the extremely
youthful old bachelors evidently considered it advantageous to
travel alone Of all these there were few who did not before evening
fell turn in at the gate of the Pike Mansion Consciously shyly or
confidently according to the condition of their souls they made their
way between the castiron deer to be presented to the visitor

Ariel sat at the top of the steps and looking amiably over their
heads talked with such as could get near her There were many who
could not and Mamie occupying the bench below was surrounded by the
overflow The difficulty of reaching and maintaining a position near
Miss Tabor was increased by the attitude and behavior of Mr Flitcroft
who that day cooled the feeling of friendship which several of his
fellowtownsmen had hitherto entertained for him He had been the
first to arrive coming alone though that was not his custom and he
established himself at Ariels right upon the step just below her so
disposing the great body and the ponderous arms and legs the gods had
given him that no one could mount above him to sit beside her or
approach her from that direction within conversational distance Once
established he was not to be dislodged and the only satisfaction for
those in this manner debarred from the society of the beautiful
stranger was obtained when they were presented to her and when they
took their departure On these occasions it was necessary by custom for
them to shake her hand a ceremony they accomplished by leaning across
Mr Flitcroft which was a long way to lean and the fat back and
shoulders were sore that night because of what had been surreptitiously
done to them by revengeful elbows and knees

Norbert not ordinarily talkative had nothing to say he seemed to
find sufficient occupation in keeping the place he had gained and from
this close vantage he fastened his small eyes immovably upon Ariels
profile Eugene also apparently determined not to move sat
throughout the afternoon at her left but as he was thin others who
came and went were able to approach upon that side and hold speech
with her

She was a stranger to these young people most of whom had grown up
together in a nickname intimacy Few of them had more than a very
imperfect recollection of her as she was before Roger Tabor and she had
departed out of Canaan She had lived her girlhood only upon their
borderland with no intimates save her grandfather and Joe and she
returned to her native town a revelation and a dream as young Mr
Bradbury told his incredulous grandmother that night

The conversation of the gallants consisted for the greater part of
witticisms at one anothers expense which though evoked for Ariels
benefit all eyes furtively reverting to her as each shaft was loosed
she found more or less enigmatical The young men however laughed at
each other loudly and seemed content if now and then she smiled You
must be frightfully ennuied with all this Eugene said to her You
see how provincial we still are

She did not answer she had not heard him The shadows were stretching
themselves over the grass long and attenuated the sunlight upon the
trees and houses was like a thin rosy pigment black birds were
calling each other home to beech and elm and Ariels eyes were fixed
upon the western distance of the street where golddust was beginning
to quiver in the air She did not hear Eugene but she started a
moment later when the name Joe Louden was pronounced by a young man
the poetic Bradbury on the step below Eugene Some one immediately
said SH But she leaned over and addressed Mr Bradbury who shut
out not only from the group about her but from the other centring
upon Miss Pike as well was holding a private conversation with a
friend in like misfortune

What were you saying of Mr Louden she asked smiling down upon the
young man It was this smile which inspired his description of her as
a revelation and a dream

Oh nothing particular was his embarrassed reply I only mentioned
Id heard there was some talk among the He paused awkwardly
remembering that Ariel had walked with Joseph Louden in the face of
Canaan that very day That is I mean to say theres some talk of his
running for Mayor

WHAT

There was a general exclamation followed by an uncomfortable moment or
two of silence No one present was unaware of that noon walk though
there was prevalent a pleasing notion that it would not happen again
founded on the idea that Ariel having only arrived the previous
evening had probably met Joe on the street by accident and
remembering him as a playmate of her childhood and uninformed as to his
reputation had naturally enough permitted him to walk home with her

Mr Flitcroft broke the silence rushing into words with a derisive
laugh Yes hes talked of for Mayorby the saloon people and the
niggers I expect the Beaver Beach crowd would be for him and if
tramps could vote he might

What is Beaver Beach asked Ariel not turning

What is Beaver Beach he repeated and cast his eyes to the sky
shaking his head awesomely Its a Place he said with abysmal
solemnitya Place I shouldnt have mentioned in your presence Miss
Tabor

What has it to do with Mr Louden

The predestined Norbert conceived the present to be a heavensent
opportunity to enlighten her concerning Joes character since the
Pikes appeared to have been derelict in the performance of this
kindness

He goes there he proceeded heavily He lived there for a while
when he first came back from running away and hes a friend of Mike
Sheehans that runs it hes a friend of all the riffraff that hang
around there

How do you know he goes there

Why it was in the paper the day after he came back He appealed for
corroboration Wasnt it Eugene

No no she persisted Newspapers are sometimes mistaken arent
they Laughing a little she swept across the bulbous face beside her
a swift regard that was like a searchlight How do you KNOW Mr
Flitcroft she went on very rapidly raising her voicehow do you
KNOW that Mr Louden is familiar with this place The newspapers may
have been falsely informed you must admit that Then how do you KNOW
Have you ever MET any one who has seen him there

Ive seen him there myself The words skipped out of Norberts mouth
like so many little devils the instant he opened it She had spoken
so quickly and with such vehemence looking him full in the eye that
he had forgotten everything in the world except making the point to
which her insistence had led him

Mamie looked horrified there was a sound of smothered laughter and
Norbert overwhelmed by the treachery of his own mouth sat gasping

It cant be such a terrific place then after all said Ariel
gently and turning to Eugene Have you ever been there Mr Bantry
she asked

He changed color but answered with enough glibness No

Several of the young men rose the wretched Flitcroft however evading
Mamies eyein which there was a distinct hintsat where he was
until all of them except Eugene had taken a reluctant departure one
group after another leaving in the order of their arrival

The rosy pigment which had colored the trees faded the golddust of
the western distance danced itself pale and departed dusk stalked into
the town from the east and still the watcher upon the steps and the
warden of the gate he of the lilacbushes and the Bible held their
places and waitedwaited alas in vain Ah Joe is THIS the
mettle of your daring Did you not say you would try Was your
courage so frail a vessel that it could not carry you even to the gate
yonder Surely you knew that if you had striven so far there you would
have been met Perhaps you foresaw that not one but two would meet
you at the gate both the warden and the watcher What of that What
of that O faint heart What was there to fear Listen The gate
clicks Ah have you come at last

Ariel started to her feet but the bent figure coming up the walk in
the darkness was that of Eskew Arp He bowed gloomily to Mamie and
in response to her inquiry if he wished to see her father answered no
he had come to talk with the granddaughter of his old friend Roger
Tabor

Mr Arp called Ariel I am so very glad She ran down to him and
gave him her hand Well sit here on the bench shant we

Mamie had risen and skirting Norbert frostily touched Eugene upon the
shoulder as she went up the steps He understood that he was to follow
her indoors and after a deep look at the bench where Ariel had
seated herself beside Mr Arp he obeyed Norbert was left a lonely
ruin between the cold twin dogs He had wrought desolation this
afternoon and that sweet verdure his good name so long in the
planting so carefully tended was now a dreary waste yet he
contemplated this not so much as his present aspect of splendid
isolation Frozen by the daughter of the house forgotten by the
visitor whose conversation with Mr Arp was carried on in tones so low
that he could not understand it the fat one though heartbreakingly
loath to take himself away began to comprehend that his hour had
struck He rose descended the steps to the bench and seated himself
unexpectedly upon the cement walk at Ariels feet Legs gone to
sleep he explained in response to her startled exclamation but
like a great soul ignoring the accident of his position as well as the
presence of Mr Arp he immediately proceeded Will you go riding with
me tomorrow afternoon

Arent you very goodnatured Mr Flitcroft she asked with an odd
intonation

Im imposed on often enough he replied rubbing his leg by people
who think I am Why

It is only that your sitting so abruptly upon the ground reminded me
of something that happened long ago before I left Canaan the last
time I met you

I dont think I knew you before you went away You havent said if
youll go riding with me tomorrow Please

Get up interrupted Mr Arp acidly Somebody ll fall over you if
you stay there

Such a catastrophe in truth loomed imminent Judge Pike was rapidly
approaching on his way to the house Bible in handfar better in hand
than was his temper for it is an enraging thing to wait five hours in
ambush for a man who does not come In the darkness a desecration
occurred and Norbert perfected to the last detail whatever had been
left incomplete of his own destruction He began lumberingly to rise
talking at the same time urging upon Ariel the charms of the roadside
wild flowers were in blossom he said recounting the benefits she
might derive through acceptance of his invitation and having thus
busily risen to his knees became aware that some one was passing near
him This some one Mr Flitcroft absorbed in artful persuasions may
have been betrayed by the darkness to mistake for Eugene Reaching out
for assistance he mechanically seized upon the skirts of a coat which
he put to the uses of a rope coming up handoverhand with such noble
weight and energy that he brought himself to his feet and the owner of
the coat to the ground simultaneously The latter hideously
astonished went down with an objurgation so outrageous in venom that
Mr Arp jumped with the shock Judge Pike got to his feet quickly but
not so quickly as the piteous Flitcroft betook himself into the deep
shadows of the street Only a word hoarse and horrorstricken was
left quivering on the night breeze by this accursed whom the gods
intent upon his ruin had early in the day at his first sight of
Ariel in good truth made mad MURDER

Can I help you brush off Judge asked Eskew rising painfully

Either Martin Pike was beyond words or the courtesy proposed by the
feeble old fellow for Eskew was now very far along in years and
looked his age emphasized too bitterly the indignity which had been
put upon him whatever the case he went his way indoors leaving the
cynics offer unacknowledged Eskew sank back upon the bench with the
little rusty sounds suggestions of creaks and sighs which accompany
the movement of antiques Ive always thought he said that the
Judge had spells when he was hard of hearing

Oblongs of light abruptly dropped from the windows confronting them
one falling across the bench appropriately touching with lemon the
acrid withered face and trembling hands of the veteran You are
younger than you were nine years ago Mr Arp said Ariel gayly I
caught a glimpse of you upon the street today and I thought so then
Now I see that I was right

MeYOUNGER he groaned No maam Im mighty near through with
this fool worldand Id be glad of it if I didnt expect that if
there IS another one afterwards it would be jest as ornery

She laughed leaning forward resting her elbows on her knee and her
chin in her hand so that the shadow of her hat shielded her eyes from
the light I thought you looked surprised when you saw me to day

I reckon I did he exclaimed Who wouldnt of been

Why

Why he repeated confounded by her simplicity Why

Yes she laughed Thats what Im anxious to know

Wasnt the whole town the same way he demanded Did you meet
anybody that didnt look surprised

But why should they

Good Lord Admighty he broke out Aint you got any
lookinglasses

I think almost all I have are still in the customs warehouse

Then use Mamie Pikes responded the old man The town never
dreamed you were goin to turn out pretty at all let alone the WAY
youve turned out pretty The Tocsin had a good deal about your looks
and so forth in it once in a letter from Paris but the folks that
remembered you kind of set that down to the way papers talk about
anybody with money and nobody was prepared for it when they saw you
You dont need to drop no curtseys to ME He set his mouth grimly in
response to the bow she made him _I_ think female beauty is like all
other human furbelows and as holler as heaven will be if only the good
people are let in But yet I did stop to look at you when you went
past me today and I kept on lookin long as you were in sight I
reckon I always will when I git the chance tooonly shows what human
nature IS But that wasnt all that folks were starin at today It
was your walkin with Joe Louden that really finished em and I can
say it upset me more than anything Ive seen for a good many years

Upset you Mr Arp she cried I dont quite see

The old man shook his head deploringly After what Id written you
about that boy

Ah she said softly touching his sleeve with her fingers I
havent thanked you for that

You neednt he returned sharply It was a pleasure Do you
remember how easy and quick I promised you

I remember that you were very kind

Kind He gave forth an acid and chilling laugh It was about two
months after Louden ran away and before you and Roger left Canaan and
you asked me to promise to write to you whenever word of that outcast
came

I didnt put it so Mr Arp

No but youd ought of You asked me to write you whatever news of
him should come and if he came back to tell you how and when and all
about it And I did it and kept you sharp on his record ever since he
landed here again Do you know why Ive done it Do you know why I
promised so quick and easy I WOULD do it

Out of the kindness of your heart I think

The acid laugh was repeated NO ma am You couldnt of guessed
colder I promised and I kept my promise because I knew there would
never be anything good to tell AND THERE NEVER WAS

Nothing at all she insisted gravely

Never I leave it to you if Ive written one good word of him

Youve written of the treatment he has received here she began and
Ive been able to see what he has borneand bears

But have I written one word to show that he didnt deserve it all
Havent I told you everything of his associates his

Indeed you have

Then do you wonder that I was more surprised than most when I saw you
walking with him today Because I knew you did it in cold blood and
knowledge aforethought Other folks thought it was because you hadnt
been here long enough to hear his reputation but I KNEW

Tell me she said if you were disappointed when you saw me with
him

Yes he snapped I was

I thought so I saw the consternation in your face You APPROVED
didnt you

I dont know what youre talking about

Yes you do I know it bothers you to have me read you between the
lines but for this once you must let me You are so consistent that
you are never disappointed when things turn out badly or people are
wicked or foolish are you

No certainly not I expect it

And you were disappointed in me today Therefore it must be that I
was doing something you knew was right and good You see She leaned
a little closer to him smiling angelically Ah Mr Arp she cried
I know your secret you ADMIRE me

He rose confused and incoherent as full of denial as a detected
pickpocket I DONT Me ADMIRE WHAT Its an ornery world he
protested I dont admire any human that ever lived

Yes you do she persisted Ive just proved it But that is the
least of your secret the great thing is this YOU ADMIRE MR LOUDEN

I never heard such nonsense he continued to protest at the same
time moving down the walk toward the gate leaning heavily on his
stick Nothin of the kind There aint any LOGIC to that kind of an
argument nor no REASON

You see I understand you she called after him Im sorry you go
away in the bitterness of being found out

Found out His stick ceased for a moment to tap the cement Pooh
he ejaculated uneasily There was a pause followed by a malevolent
chuckle At any rate he said with joy in the afterthought youll
never go walkin with him AGAIN

He waited for the answer which came after a time sadly Perhaps
you are right Perhaps I shall not

Ha I thought so Goodnight

Goodnight Mr Arp


She turned toward the lighted house Through the windows nearest her
she could see Mamie seated in the familiar chair following with happy
and tender eyes the figure of Eugene who was pacing up and down the
room The town was deadly quiet Ariel could hear the sound of
footsteps perhaps a block away She went to the gate and gazed a long
time into the empty street watching the yellow grains of light sieved
through the maples from the arc lights on the corner moving to and fro
in the deep shadow as the lamp swung slightly in the night air
Somewhere not far away the peace was broken by the screams of a
parlor organ which honked and wailed in pious agonies the intention
was hymnal interminably protracting each spasm Presently a womans
voice outdid the organ a voice which made vivid the picture of the
woman who owned it and the ploughed forehead of her above the
noseglasses when the gracenotes were proudly given birth Rescue
the Perishing was the startlingly appropriate selection rendered with
inconceivable lingering upon each syllable Rooscyoo the
Poorooshoong At unexpected intervals two male voices evidently
belonging to men who had contracted the habit of holding tin in their
mouths joined the lady in a thorough search for the Lost Chord

That was the last of silence in Canaan for an hour or so The organ
was merely inaugural across the street a piano sounded firm
emphatic determined vocal competition with the instrument here also
Rock of Ages the incentive Another piano presently followed suit
in a neighboring house Precious Jewels More distant a second
organ was heard other pianos other organs took up other themes and
as a wakeful puppys barking will go over a village at night stirring
first the nearer dogs to give voice these in turn stimulating those
farther away to join one passing the excitement on to another until
hounds in farmyards far beyond the town contribute to the
longdistance conversation even so did Rescue the Perishing enliven
the greater part of Canaan

It was this that made Ariel realize a thing of which hitherto she had
not been able to convince herself that she was actually once more in
the town where she had spent her longago girlhood now grown to seem
the girlhood of some other person It was true her foot was on her
native heath and her name was Ariel Taborthe very name of the girl
who had shared the towns disapproval with Joe Louden Rescue the
Perishing brought it all back to her and she listened to these
sharply familiar rites of the Canaanite Sabbath evening with a shiver
of pain

She turned from the gate to go into the house heard Eugenes voice at
the door and paused He was saying goodnight to Mamie

And please say au revoir to Miss Tabor for me he added peering
out under his hand I dont know where she can have gone

Probably she came in and went to her room said Mamie

Dont forget to tell her au revoir

I wont dear Goodnight

Goodnight She lifted her face and he kissed her perfunctorily
Then he came down the steps and went slowly toward the gate looking
about him into the darkness as if searching for something but Ariel
had fled away from the path of light that led from the open door

She skimmed noiselessly across the lawn and paused at the side of the
house leaning against the veranda where on a night long past a boy
had hid and a girl had wept A small creaking sound fell upon her ear
and she made out an ungainly figure approaching wheeling something of
curious shape

Is that you Sam she said

Mr Warden stopped close by Yesm he replied Im agittin out
de hose to lay de dus yonnah He stretched an arm along the
crossbar of the reel relaxing himself apparently for conversation
Yall done change considable Miss Airil he continued with the
directness of one sure of privilege

WHITE ROSES IN A LAWOFFICE

As upon a world canopied with storm hung with mourning purple and
habited in black did Mr Flitcroft turn his morning face at eight
oclock antemeridian Monday as he hied himself to his daily duty at
the Washington National Bank Yet more than the merely funereal
gloomed out from the hillocky area of his countenance Was there not
ifaith a glow a Vesuvian shimmer beneath the murk of that darkling
eye Was here one think you to turn the other cheek Little has he
learned of Norbert Flitcroft who conceives that this fiery spirit was
easily to be quenched Look upon the jowl of him and let him who
dares maintain that peopleeven the very Pikes themselveswere to
grind beneath their brougham wheels a prostrate Norbert and ride on
scatheless In this his own metaphor is nearly touched I guess not
They dont run over ME Martin Pike better look out how he tries it

So Mother Nature at her kindly tasks good Norbert uses for her
unguent our own perfect inconsistency and often when we are stabbed
deep in the breast she distracts us by thin scratches in other parts
that in the itch of these we may forget the greater hurt till it be
healed Thus the remembrance of last night when you undisguisedly
ran from the wrath of a Pike with a pretty girl looking on to say
nothing of the acrid Arp who will fling the legend on a thousand
winds might well agonize you now as in less hasty moments and at a
safe distance you brood upon the piteous figure you cut On the
contrary behold you see no blood crimsoning the edges of the horrid
gash in your panoply of selfesteem you but smart and scratch the
scratches forgetting your wound in the hot itch for vengeance It is
an itch which will last for in such matters your temper shall be
steadfast and let the great Goliath in the mean time beware of you
You ran last night You ranof course you ran Why not You ran to
fight another day

A bank clerk sometimes has opportunities

The stricken fat one could not understand how it came about that he had
blurted out the damning confession that he had visited Beaver Beach
When he tried to solve the puzzle his mind refused the strain became
foggy and the terrors of his position acute Was he like Joe Louden
to endure the ban of Canaan and like him stand excommunicate beyond
the pale because of Martin Pikes displeasure For Norbert saw with
perfect clearness today what the Judge had done for Joe Now that he
stood in danger of a fate identical this came home to him How many
others he wondered would do as Mamie had done and write notes such as
he had received by the hand of Sam Warden late last night


DEAR SIR This from Mamie who in the Canaanitish way had been
wont to address him as NorbMy father wishes me to state that
after your remark yesterday afternoon on the steps which was overheard
by my mother who happened to be standing in the hall behind you and
your BEHAVIOR to himself later onhe considers it impossible to allow
you to call any more or to speak to any member of his household

 Yours respectfully
 MAMIE PIKE


Erasures and restorations bore witness to a considerable doubt in
Mamies mind concerning Yours respectfully but she had finally let
it stand evidently convinced that the plain signature without
preface savored of an intimacy denied by the context

DEAR SIR repeated Norbert between set teeth IMPOSSIBLE TO
ALLOW YOU TO CALL any more These and other terms of his dismissal
recurred to him during the morning and ever and anon he looked up from
his desk his lips moving to the tune of those horrid phrases and
stared out at the street Basilisk glaring this with no Christian
softness in it not even when it fell upon his own grandfather sitting
among the sages within easy eyeshot from the big window at Norberts
elbow However Colonel Flitcroft was not disturbed by the gaze of his
descendant being in fact quite unaware of it The aged men were
having a busy morning

The conclave was not what it had been See Arp and all his works
There had come as the years went by a few recruits but faces were
missing the two Tabors had gone and Uncle Joe Davey could no longer
lay claim to the patriarchship he had laid it down with a halfsigh
and gone his way Eskew himself was now the oldest of the conscript
fathers the Colonel and Squire Buckalew pressing him closely with
Peter Bradbury no great time behind

Today they did not plant their feet upon the brass rail inside the
hotel windows but courted the genial weather outdoors and as their
summer custom was tilted back their chairs in the shade of the western
wall of the building

And who could of dreamed Mr Bradbury was saying with a sideglance
of expectancy at Eskew that Jonas Tabor would ever turn out to have a
niece like that

Mr Arp ceased to fan himself with his wide straw hat and said grimly

I dont see as Jonas HAS turned outnot in particular If hes
turned at all lately I reckon its in his grave and Ill bet he HAS
if he had any way of hearin how much she must of spent for clothes

I believe Squire Buckalew began that young folks memories are
short

Theyre lucky interjected Eskew The shorter your memory the less
meanness you know

I meant young folks dont remember as well as older people do
continued the Squire I dont see whats so remarkable in her comin
back and walkin upstreet with Joe Louden She used to go kitin
round with him all the time before she left here And yet everybody
talks as if they never HEARD of sech a thing

It seems to me said Colonel Flitcroft hesitatingly that she did
right I know it sounds kind of a queer thing to say and I stirred up
a good deal of opposition at home yesterday evening by sort of
mentioning something of the kind Nobody seemed to agree with me
except Norbert and he didnt SAY much but

He was interrupted by an uncontrollable cackle which issued from the
mouth of Mr Arp The Colonel turned upon him with a frown inquiring
the cause of his mirth

It put me in mind Mr Arp began promptly of something that
happened last night

What was it

Eskews mouth was open to tell but he remembered just in time that
the grandfather of Norbert was not the audience properly to be selected
for this recital choked a halfborn word coughed loudly realizing
that he must withhold the story of the felling of Martin Pike until the
Colonel had taken his departure and replied

Nothin to speak of Go on with your argument

Ive finished said the Colonel I only wanted to say that it seems
to me a good action for a young lady like that to come back here and
stick to her old friend and playmate

STICK to him echoed Mr Arp She walked up Main Street with him
yesterday Do you call that stickin to him Shes been away a good
while shes forgotten what Canaan IS You wait till she sees for
herself jest what his standing in this com

I agree with Eskew for once interrupted Peter Bradbury I agree
because

Then you better wait cried Eskew allowing him to proceed no
farther till you hear what youre agreein to I say you take a
young lady like that pretty and rich and all cultured up and it
stands to reason that she wont

No it dont exclaimed Buckalew impatiently Nothing of the sort
I tell you

Eskew rose to his feet and pounded the pavement with his stick It
stands to reason that she wont stick to a man no other decent woman
will speak to a feller thats been the mark for every stone throwed in
the town ever since he was a boy an outcast with a reputation as
black as a preachers shoes on Sunday I dont care if hes her oldest
friend on EARTH she wont stick to him She walked with him
yesterday but you can mark my words his goose is cooked The old
mans voice rose shrill and high It aint in human nature fer her
to do it You hear what I say youll never see her with Joe Louden
again in this livin world and she as good as told me so herself
last night You can take your oath shes quit him already Dont

Eskew paused abruptly his eyes widening behind his spectacles his jaw
fell his stick raised to hammer the pavement remained suspended in
the air A sudden color rushed over his face and he dropped
speechless in his chair The others after staring at him in momentary
alarm followed the direction of his gaze

Just across Main Street and in plain view was the entrance to the
stairway which led to Joes office Ariel Tabor all in cool gray
carrying a big bunch of white roses in her whitegloved hands had just
crossed the sidewalk from a carriage and was ascending the dark
stairway A moment later she came down again emptyhanded got into
the carriage and drove away

She missed him said Squire Buckalew I saw him go out half an hour
ago BUT he added and exercising a selfrestraint close upon the
saintly did not even glance toward the heap which was Mr Arp I
notice she left her flowers


Ariel was not the only one who climbed the dingy stairs that day and
read the pencilled script upon Joes door Will not return until
evening J Louden Many others came all exceedingly unlike the
first visitor some were quick and watchful dodging into the narrow
entrance furtively some smiled contemptuously as long as they were in
view of the street drooping wanly as they reached the stairs some
were brazen and amused and some were thin and troubled Not all of
them read the message for not all could read but all looked curiously
through the halfopened door at the many roses which lifted their heads
delicately from a waterpitcher on Joes desk to scent that dusty place
with their cool breath

Most of these clients after a grunt of disappointment turned and went
away though there were a few either unable to read the message or so
pressed by anxiety that they disregarded it who entered the room and
sat down to wait for the absentee There were plenty of chairs in the
office now bookcases also and a big steel safe But when evening
came and the final gray of twilight had vanished from the windowpanes
all had gone except one a woman who sat patiently her eyes upon the
floor and her hands folded in her lap until the footsteps of the last
of the others to depart had ceased to sound upon the pavement below
Then with a wordless exclamation she sprang to her feet pulled the
windowshade carefully down to the sill and when she had done that
struck a match on the heel of her shoea soiled white canvas shoe not
a small oneand applied the flame to a gas jet The yellow light
flared up and she began to pace the room haggardly

The courthouse bell rang nine and as the tremors following the last
stroke pulsed themselves into silence she heard a footfall on the
stairs and immediately relapsed into a chair folding her hands again
in her lap her expression composing itself to passivity for the step
was very much lighter than Joes

A lady beautifully dressed in white dimity appeared in the doorway
She hesitated at the threshold not apparently because of any
timidity her expression being too thoughtfully assured for that but
almost immediately she came in and seated herself near the desk
acknowledging the others presence by a slight inclination of the head

This grave courtesy caused a strong deep flush to spread itself under
the rouge which unevenly covered the womans cheeks as she bowed
elaborately in return Then furtively during a protracted silence
she took stock of the newcomer from the tip of her white suede shoes
to the filmy lace and pink roses upon her wide white hat and the
sidelong gaze lingered marvellingly upon the quiet delicate hands
slender and finely expressive in their white gloves

Her own hands unlike the ladys began to fidget confusedly and the
silence continuing she coughed several times to effect the preface
required by her sense of fitness before she felt it proper to observe
with a polite titter

Mr Louden seems to be a good while comin

Have you been waiting very long asked the lady

Ever since six oclock

Yes said the other That is very long

Yes maam it certnly is The ice thus broken she felt free to
use her eyes more directly and after a long frank stare exclaimed

Why you must be Miss Ariel Tabor aint you

Yes Ariel touched one of the roses upon Joes desk with her
fingertips I am Miss Tabor

Well excuse me fer asking Im sure it aint any business of mine
said the other remembering the manners due one lady from another
But I thought it must be I expect she added with loud
inconsequent laughter theres not many in Canaan aint heard youve
come back She paused laughed again nervously and again less
loudly to take off the edge of her abruptness gradually tittering
herself down to a pause to fill which she put forth Right nice
weather we ben havin

Yes said Ariel

It was rainy first of last week though _I_ dont mind rain so
muchthis with more laughterI stay in the house when it rains
Some people dont know enough to they say Youve heard that saying
aint you Miss Tabor

Yes

Well I tell YOU she exclaimed noisily theres plenty ladies and
genlemen in this town thats like that

Her laughter did not cease it became louder and shriller It had
been until now a mere lubrication of the conversation helping to
make her easier in Miss Tabors presence but as it increased in
shrillness she seemed to be losing control of herself as if her
laughter were getting away with her she was not far from hysteria
when it stopped with a gasp and she sat up straight in her chair
white and rigid

THERE she said listening intently Aint that him Steps
sounded upon the pavement below paused for a second at the foot of the
stairs there was the snap of a match then the steps sounded again
retreating She sank back in her chair limply It was only some one
stoppin to light his cigar in the entry It wasnt Joe Loudens step
anyway

You know his step Ariels eyes were bent upon the woman wonderingly

Id know it tonight was the answer delivered with a sharp and
painful giggle I got plenty reason to

Ariel did not respond She leaned a little closer to the roses upon
the desk letting them touch her face and breathing deeply of their
fragrance to neutralize a perfume which pervaded the room an odor as
heavy and cheapsweet as the face of the woman who had saturated her
handkerchief with it a scent which went with her perfectly and made
her unhappily definite suited to her clumsily dyed hair to her soiled
white shoes to the hot red hat smothered in plumage to the restless
stubfingered hands to the fat plated rings of which she wore a
great quantity though surprisingly enough the large diamonds in her
ears were pure and of a very clear water

It was she who broke the silence once more Well she drawled
coughing genteelly at the same time better late than never as the
saying is I wonder who it is gits up all them comical sayings
Apparently she had no genuine desire for light upon this mystery as
she continued immediately I have a genleman friend thats always
gittin em off Well he says the best of friends must part
and Thou strikest me to the heartall kinds of cracks like that
Hes real comical And yet she went on in an altered voice I dont
like him much Id be glad if Id never seen him

The change of tone was so marked that Ariel looked at her keenly to
find herself surprised into pitying this strange client of Joes for
tears had sprung to the womans eyes and slid along the lids where she
tried vainly to restrain them Her face had altered too like her
voice haggard lines suddenly appearing about the eyes and mouth as if
they had just been pencilled there the truth issuing from beneath her
pinchbeck simulations like a tragic mask revealed by the displacement
of a tawdry covering

I expect you think Im real foolish she said but I ben waitin so
awful longand I got a good deal of worry on my mind till I see Mr
Louden

I am sorry Ariel turned from the roses and faced her and the heavy
perfume I hope he will come soon

I hope so said the other Its something to do with me that keeps
him away and the longer he is the more it scares me She shivered
and set her teeth together Its kind of hard waitin I certnly
got my share of troubles

Dont you think that Mr Louden will be able to take care of them for
you

Oh I HOPE so Miss Tabor If he cant nobody can She was crying
openly now wiping her eyes with her musksoaked handkerchief We had
to send fer him yesterday afternoon

To come to Beaver Beach do you mean asked Ariel leaning forward

Yes maam It all begun out thereleastways it begun before that
with me It was all my fault I deserve all thats comin to me I
guess I done wrongI done wrong Id oughtnt never to of went out
there yesterday

She checked herself sharply but after a moments pause continued
encouraged by the grave kindliness of the delicate face in the shadow
of the wide white hat Id oughtnt to of went she repeated Oh
I reckon Ill never never learn enough to keep out o trouble even
when I see it comin But that gentleman friend of mineMr Nashville
Corys his namehe kind o coaxed me into it and hes right comical
when hes with ladies and hes good companyand he says Claudine
well dance the light fantastic he says and I kind o wanted
something cheerfulId ben workin steady quite a spell and it
looked like he wanted to show me a good time so I went and thats
what started it Now that she had begun she babbled on with her
story at times incoherently full of excuses made to herself more
than to Ariel pitifully endeavoring to convince herself that the
responsibility for the muddle she had made was not hers

Mr Cory told me my husband was drinkin and wouldnt know about it
and Besides he says whats the odds Of course I knowed there
was trouble between him and Mr Fearthats my husbanda good while
ago when Mr Fear up and laid him out That was before me and Mr
Fear got married I hadnt even ben to Canaan then I was on the
stage I was on the stage quite a while in Chicago before I got
acquainted with my husband

You were on the stage Ariel exclaimed involuntarily

Yes maam Livin pitchers at Goldbergs Ratskeller and amunchoor
nights I nearly always done a sketch with a genleman friend Thats
the way I met Mr Fear he seemed to be real struck with me right away
and soon as I got through my turn he ast me to order whatever I wanted
Hes always genlemanlike when he aint had too much and even then he
vurry vurry seldom acks rough unless hes jealous That was the
trouble yesterday I never would of gone to the Beach if Id dreamed
what was comin When we got there I saw Mikethats the genleman
that runs the Beachlookin at my company and me kind of anxious and
pretty soon he got me away from Mr Cory and told me whats what
Seems this Cory only wanted me to go with him to make my husband mad
and hed took good care that Mr Fear heard Id be there with him And
hed ben hangin around me every time he struck town jest to make
Mr Fear madthe fresh thing You see he wanted to make my husband
start something again this Mr Cory did and he was fixed for it

I dont understand said Ariel

Its this way if Mr Fear attacted Mr Cory why Mr Cory could
shoot him down and claim selfdefence You see it would be easy for
Mr Cory because Mr Fear nearly killed him when they had their first
trouble and that would give Mr Cory a good excuse to shoot if Mr
Fear jest only pushed him Thats the way it is with the law Mr
Cory could wipe out their old score and git off scotfree

Surely not

Yes maam thats the way it would be And when Mike told me that
Mr Cory had got me out there jest to provoke my husband I went
straight up to him and begun to give him a piece of my mind I didnt
talk loud because I never was one to make a disturbance and start
trouble the way SOME do and right while I was talkin we both see my
husband pass the window Mr Cory give a kind of yelling laugh and put
his arm round me jest as Mr Fear come in the door And then it all
happened so quick that you could hardly tell what WAS goin on Mr
Fear we found afterwards had promised Mr Louden that he wouldnt
come out there but he took too muchyou could see that by the look of
himand fergot his promise fergot everything but me and Cory I guess

He come right up to us where I was tryin to git away from Corys
armit was the left one he had around me and the other behind his
backand neither of em said a word Cory kept on laughin loud as he
could and Mr Fear struck him in the mouth Hes little but he can
hit awful hard and Mr Cory let out a screech and I see his gun go
offright in Mr Fears face I thought but it wasnt it only
scorched him Most of the other genlemen had run but Mike made a
dive and managed to knock the gun to one side jest barely in time
Then Mike and three or four others that come out from behind things
separated emboth of em fightin to git at each other They locked
Mr Cory up in Mikes room and took Mr Fear over to where they hitch
the horses Then Mike sent fer Mr Louden to come out to talk to my
husband and take care of himhes the only one can do anything with
him when hes like thatbut before Mr Louden could git there Mr
Fear broke loose and run through a cornfield and got away at least
they couldnt find him And Mr Cory jumped through a window and slid
down into one of Mikes boats so theyd both gone When Mr Louden
come he only stayed long enough to hear what had happened and started
out to find Happythats my husband Hes bound to keep them apart
but he hasnt found Mr Fear yet or hed be here

Ariel had sunk back in her chair Why should your husband hide she
asked in a low voice

Waitin fer his chance at Cory the woman answered huskily I
expect hes afraid the cops are after him too on account of the
trouble and he doesnt want to git locked up till hes met Cory again
They aint after him but he may not know it They havent heard of
the trouble I reckon or theyd of run Cory in HES around town
today drinkin heavy and I guess hes lookin fer Mr Fear about as
hard as Mr Louden is She rose to her feet lifted her coarse hands
and dropped them despairingly Oh Im scared she said Mr
Fears ben mighty good to me

A slow and tired footstep was heard upon the stairs and Joes dog ran
into the room droopingly wagged his tail with no energy and crept
under the desk Mrs Fear wheeled toward the door and stood rigid
her hands clenched tight her whole body still except her breast
which rose and fell with her tumultuous breathing She could not wait
till the laggard step reached the landing

MR LOUDEN she called suddenly

Joes voice came from the stairway Its all right Claudine Its
all fixed up Dont worry

Mrs Fear gave a thick cry of relief and sank back in her chair as Joe
entered the room He came in shamblingly with his hand over his eyes
as if they were very tired and the light hurt them so that for a
moment or two he did not perceive the second visitor Then he let his
hand fall revealing a face very white and worn

Its all right Claudine he repeated Its all right

He was moving to lay his hat on the desk when his eye caught first the
roses then fell upon Ariel and he stopped stockstill with one arm
outstretched remaining for perhaps ten seconds in that attitude while
she her lips parted her eyes lustrous returned his gaze with a look
that was as inscrutable as it was kind

Yes she said as if in answer to a question I have come here twice
today She nodded slightly toward Mrs Fear I can wait I am
very glad you bring good news

Joe turned dazedly toward the other Claudine he said youve been
telling Miss Tabor

I certnly have Mrs Fears expression had cleared and her tone was
cheerful I dont see no harm in that Im sure shes a good friend
of YOURS Mr Louden

Joe glanced at Ariel with a faint troubled smile and turned again to
Mrs Fear Ive had a long talk with Happy

Im awful glad Is he ready to listen to reason she asked with a
titter

Hes waiting for you

Where She rose quickly

Stop said Joe sharply You must be very careful with him

Dont you spose Im goin to be she interrupted with a catch in
her voice Dont you spose Ive had trouble enough

No said Joe deliberately and impersonally I dont Unless you
keep remembering to be careful all the time youll follow the first
impulse you have as you did yesterday and your excuse will be that
you never thought any harm would come of it Hes in a queer mood but
he will forgive you if you ask him

Well aint that what I WANT to do she exclaimed

I know I know he said dropping into the deskchair and passing his
hand over his eyes with a gesture of infinite weariness But you must
be very careful I hunted for him most of the night and all day He
was trying to keep out of my way because he didnt want me to find him
until he had met this fellow Nashville Happy is a hard man to come at
when he doesnt care to be found and he kept shifting from place to
place until I ran him down Then I got him in a corner and told him
that you hadnt meant any harmwhich is always true of you poor
womanand I didnt leave him till he had promised me to forgive you
if you would come and ask him And you must keep him out of Corys way
until I can arrange to have himCory I meansent out of town Will
you

Why certnly she answered smiling That Nashvilles the vurry
last person I ever want to see againthe fresh thing Mrs Fears
burden had fallen her relief was perfect and she beamed vapidly but
Joe marked her renewed irresponsibility with an anxious eye

You mustnt make any mistakes he said rising stiffly with fatigue

Not ME _I_ dont take no more chances she responded tittering
happily Not after yesterday MY but its a load off my shoulders
I do hate it to have genlemen quarrelling over me especially Mr
Fear I never DID like to START anything I like to see people laugh
and be friendly and Im mighty glad its all blown over I kind o
thought it would all along PSHO She burst into genuine noisy
laughter I dont expect either of em meant no real harm to each
other after they got cooled off a little If theyd met today
theyd probably both run Now Mr Louden wheres Happy

Joe went to the door with her He waited a moment perplexed then his
brow cleared and he said in a low voice You know the alley beyond
Vent Millers poolroom Go down the alley till you come to the second
gate Go in and youll see a basement door opening into a little room
under Millers bar The door wont be locked and Happys in there
waiting for you But remember

Oh dont you worry she cut him off loudly I know HIM Inside of
an hour Ill have him LAUGHIN over all this Youll see

When she had gone he stood upon the landing looking thoughtfully after
her Perhaps after all that is the best mood to let her meet him
in he murmured

Then with a deep breath he turned The heavy perfume had gone the
air was clear and sweet and Ariel was pressing her face into the roses
again As he saw how like them she was he was shaken with a profound
and mysterious sigh like that which moves in the breast of one who
listens in the dark to his dearest music

HAPPY FEAR GIVES HIMSELF UP

I know how tired you are said Ariel as he came back into the room
I shall not keep you long

Ah please do he returned quickly beginning to fumble with the
shade of a studentlamp at one end of the desk

Let me do that she said Sit down He obeyed at once and
watched her as she lit the lamp and stretching upon tiptoe turned
out the gas No she continued seated again and looking across the
desk at him I wanted to see you at the first possible opportunity
but what I have to say

Wait he interrupted Let me tell you why I did not come yesterday

You need not tell me I know She glanced at the chair which had
been occupied by Mrs Fear I knew last night that they had sent for
you

You did he exclaimed Ah I understand Sam Warden must have told
you

Yes she said It was he and I have been wondering ever since how
he heard of it He knew last night but there was nothing in the
papers this morning and until I came here I heard no one else speak of
it yet Canaan is not large

Joe laughed It wouldnt seem strange if you lived with the Canaan
that I do Sam had been downtown during the afternoon and had met
friends the colored people are a good deal like a freemasonry you
know A great many knew last night all about what had happened and
had their theories about what might happen today in case the two men
met Still you see those who knew also knew just what people not to
tell The Tocsin is the only newspaper worth the name here but even
if the Tocsin had known of the trouble it wouldnt have been likely to
mention it Thats a thing I dont understand He frowned and rubbed
the back of his head Theres something underneath it For more than
a year the Tocsin hasnt spoken of Beaver Beach Id like to know why

Joe she said slowly tell me something truly A man said to me
yesterday that he found life here insufferable Do you find it so

Why no he answered surprised

Do you hate Canaan

Certainly not

You dont find it dull provincial unsympathetic

He laughed cheerily Well theres this he explained I have an
advantage over your friend I see a more interesting side of things
probably The people I live among are pretty thorough cosmopolites in a
way and the life I lead

I think I begin to understand a little about the life you lead she
interrupted Then you dont complain of Canaan

Of course not

She threw him a quick bright happy look then glanced again at the
chair in which Mrs Fear had sat Joe she said last night I heard
the people singing in the houses the old Sundayevening way It took
me back so

Yes it would And something else theres one hymn they sing more
than any other its Canaans favorite Do you know what it is

Is it Rescue the Perishing

Thats it Rescue the Perishing he cried and repeating the words
again gave forth a peal of laughter so hearty that it brought tears to
his eyes RESCUE THE PERISHING

At first she did not understand his laughter but after a moment she
did and joined her own to it though with a certain tremulousness

It IS funny isnt it said Joe wiping the moisture from his eyes
Then all trace of mirth left him Is it really YOU sitting here and
laughing with me Ariel

It seems to be she answered in a low voice Im not at all sure

You didnt think yesterday afternoon he began almost in a
whisperyou didnt think that I had failed to come because I He
grew very red and shifted the sentence awkwardly I was afraid you
might think that I wasthat I didnt come because I might have been
the same way again that I was whenwhen I met you at the station

Oh no she answered gently No I knew better

And do you know he faltered that that is all over That it can
never happen again

Yes I know it she returned quickly

Then you know a little of what I owe you

No no she protested

Yes he said Youve made that change in me already It wasnt
hardit wont bethough it might have been ifif you hadnt come
soon

Tell me something she demanded If these people had not sent for
you yesterday would you have come to Judge Pikes house to see me
You said you would try She laughed a little and looked away from
him I want to know if you would have come

There was a silence and in spite of her averted glance she knew that
he was looking at her steadily Finally Dont you know he said

She shook her head and blushed faintly

Dont you know he repeated

She looked up and met his eyes and thereupon both became very grave
Yes I do she answered You would have come When you left me at
the gate and went away you were afraid But you would have come

YesId have come You are right I was afraid at first but I
knew he went on rapidly that you would have come to the gate to
meet me

You understood that she cried her eyes sparkling and her face
flushing happily

Yes I knew that you wouldnt have asked me to come he said with a
catch in his voice which was half chuckle half groan if you hadnt
meant to take care of me And it came to me that you would know how to
do it

She leaned back in her chair and again they laughed together but only
for a moment becoming serious and very quiet almost instantly

I havent thanked you for the roses he said

Oh yes you did When you first looked at them

So I did he whispered Im glad you saw To find them here took my
breath awayand to find you with them

I brought them this morning you know

Would you have come if you had not understood why I failed yesterday

Oh yes I think so she returned the fine edge of a smile upon her
lips For a time last evening before I heard what had happened I
thought you were too frightened a friend to bother about

He made a little ejaculation partly joyful partly sad

And yet she went on I think that I should have come this morning
after all even if you had a poorer excuse for your absence because
you see I came on business

You did

Thats why Ive come again That makes it respectable for me to be
here now doesnt itfor me to have come out alone after dark without
their knowing it Im here as your client Joe

Why he asked

She did not answer at once but picked up a pen from beneath her hand
on the desk and turning it meditatively felt its point with her
forefinger before she said slowly Are most men careful of other
peopleswell of other peoples money

You mean Martin Pike he asked

Yes I want you to take charge of everything I have for me

He bent a frowning regard upon the lampshade You ought to look after
your own property he said You surely have plenty of time

You meanyou mean you wont help me she returned with intentional
pathos

Ariel he laughed shortly in answer then asked What makes you
think Judge Pike isnt trustworthy

Nothing very definite perhaps unless it was his look when I told him
that I meant to ask you to take charge of things for me

Hes been rather hard pressed this year I think said Joe You
might be rightif he could have found a way I hope he hasnt

Im afraid she began gayly that I know very little of my own
affairs He sent me a draft every three months with receipts and
other things to sign and return to him I havent the faintest notion
of what I ownexcept the old house and some money from the income that
I hadnt used and brought with me Judge Pike has all the
paperseverything

Joe looked troubled And Roger Tabor did he

The dear man She shook her head He was just the same To him
poor Uncle Jonass money seemed to come from heaven through the hands
of Judge Pike

And theres a handsome roundabout way said Joe

Wasnt it she agreed cheerfully And he trusted the Judge
absolutely I dont you see

He gave her a thoughtful look and nodded No he isnt a good man he
said not even according to his lights but I doubt if he could have
managed to get away with anything of consequence after he became the
administrator He wouldnt have tried it probably unless he was more
desperately pushed than I think he has been It would have been too
dangerous Suppose you wait a week or so and think it over

But theres something I want you to do for me immediately Joe

Whats that

I want the old house put in order Im going to live there

Alone

Im almost twentyseven and thats being enough of an old maid for me
to risk Canaans thinking me eccentric isnt it

It will think anything you do is all right

And once she cried it thought everything I did all wrong

Yes Thats the difference

You mean it will commend me because Im thought rich

No no he said meditatively it isnt that Its because everybody
will be in love with you

Quite everybody she asked

Certainly he replied Anybody who didnt would be absurd

Ah Joe she laughed You always were the nicest boy in the world
my dear

At that he turned toward her with a sudden movement and his lips
parted but not to speak She had rested one arm upon the desk and her
cheek upon her hand the pen she had picked up still absently held in
her fingers touching her lips and it was given to him to know that he
would always keep that pen though he would never write with it again
The soft lamplight fell across the lower part of her face leaving her
eyes which were lowered thoughtfully in the shadow of her hat The
room was blotted out in darkness behind her Like the background of an
antique portrait the office with its dusty corners and shelves and
hideous safe had vanished leaving the charming and thoughtful face
revealed against an even spacious brownness Only Ariel and the roses
and the lamp were clear and a strange small pain moved from Joes
heart to his throat as he thought that this ugly office always before
so harsh and grim and lonelyloneliest for him when it had been most
crowdedwas now transfigured into something very very different from
an office that this place where he sat with a lamp and flowers on a
desk between him and a woman who called him my dear must be
likelike something that people called home

And then he leaned across the desk toward her as he said again what he
had said a little while beforeand his voice trembled

Ariel it IS you

She looked at him and smiled

Youll be here always wont you Youre not going away from Canaan
again

For a moment it seemed that she had not heard him Then her bright
glance at him wavered and fell She rose turning slightly away from
him but not so far that he could not see the sudden agitation in her
face

Ah he cried rising too I dont want you to think I dont
understand or that I meant _I_ should ever ask you to stay here I
couldnt mean that you know I couldnt dont you You know I
understand that its all just your beautiful friendliness dont you

It isnt beautiful its just ME Joe she said It couldnt be any
other way

Its enough that you should be here now he went on bravely his
voice steady though his hand shook Nothing so wonderful as your
staying could ever actually happen Its just a light coming into a
dark room and out again One day long agoI never forgot itsome
appleblossoms blew by me as I passed an orchard and its like that
too But oh my dear when you go youll leave a fragrance in my
heart that will last

She turned toward him her face suffused with a rosy light Youd
rather have died than have said that to me once she cried Im glad
youre weak enough now to confess it

He sank down again into his chair and his arms fell heavily on the
desk Confess it he cried despairingly And you dont deny that
youre going away againso its true I wish I hadnt realized it so
soon I think Id rather have tried to fool myself about it a little
longer

Joe she cried in a voice of great pain you mustnt feel like
that How do you know Im going away again Why should I want the old
house put in order unless I mean to stay And if I went you know that
I could never change you know how Ive always cared for you

Yes he said I do know how It was always the same and it always
will be wont it

Ive shown that she returned quickly

Yes You say I know how youve cared for meand I do I know HOW
Its just in one certain wayJonathan and David

Isnt that a pretty good way Joe

Never fear that I dont understand He got to his feet again and
looked at her steadily

Thank you Joe She wiped sudden tears from her eyes

Dont you be sorry for me he said Do you think that passing the
love of women isnt enough for me

No she answered humbly

Ill have people at work on the old house tomorrow he began And
for the

Ive kept you so long she interrupted helped to a meek sort of
gayety by his matteroffact tone Goodnight Joe She gave him her
hand I dont want you to come with me It isnt very late and this
is Canaan

I want to come with you however he said picking up his hat You
cant go alone

But you are so tired you

She was interrupted There were muffled flying footsteps on the
stairs and a shabby little man ran furtively into the room shut the
door behind him and set his back against it His face was mottled
like a colored map thick lines of perspiration shining across the
splotches

Joe he panted Ive got Nashville good and hes got me good
tooI got to clear out Hes fixed me good damn him but he wont
trouble nobody

Joe was across the room like a flying shadow

QUIET His voice rang like a shot and on the instant his hand fell
sharply across the speakers mouth In THERE Happy

He threw an arm across the little mans shoulders and swung him toward
the door of the other room

Happy Fear looked up from beneath the downbent brim of his black
slouch hat his eyes followed an imperious gesture toward Ariel gave
her a brief ghastly stare and stumbled into the inner chamber

Wait Joe said cavalierly to Ariel He went in quickly after Mr
Fear and closed the door

This was Joseph Louden AttorneyatLaw and to Ariel it was like a new
face seen in a flashlightnot at all the face of Joe The sense of
his strangeness his unfamiliarity in this electrical aspect overcame
her She was possessed by astonishment Did she know him so well
after all The strange client had burst in shaken beyond belief with
some passion unknown to her but Joe alert and masterful beyond
denial had controlled him instantly had swept him into the other room
as with a broom Could it be that Joe sometimes did other things in
the same sweeping fashion

She heard a match struck in the next room and the voices of the two
men Joes then the others the latter at first broken and
protestive but soon rising shrilly She could hear only fragments
Once she heard the client cry almost scream By God Joe I thought
Claudine had chased him around there to DO me And instantly
followed Loudens voice

STEADY HAPPY STEADY

The name Claudine startled her and although she had had no
comprehension of the argot of Happy Fear the sense of a mysterious
catastrophe oppressed her she was sure that something horrible had
happened She went to the window touched the shade which disappeared
upward immediately and lifted the sash The front of a square
building in the Courthouse Square was bright with lights and figures
were passing in and out of the Main Street doors She remembered that
this was the jail

Claudine The voice of the husband of Claudine was like the voice of
one lamenting over Jerusalem

STEADY HAPPY STEADY

But Joe if they git me whatll she do She cant hold her job no
longernot after this

The door opened and the two men came out Joe with his hand on the
others shoulder The splotches had gone from Happys face leaving it
an even deathly white He did not glance toward Ariel he gazed far
beyond all that was about him and suddenly she was aware of a great
tragedy The little mans chin trembled and he swallowed painfully
nevertheless he bore himself upright and dauntlessly as the two walked
slowly to the door like men taking part in some fateful ceremony Joe
stopped upon the landing at the head of the stairs but Happy Fear went
on clumping heavily down the steps

Its all right Happy said Joe Its better for you to go alone
Dont you worry Ill see you through It will be all right

Just as YOU say Joe a breaking voice came back from the foot of the
stepsjust as YOU say

The lawyer turned from the landing and went rapidly to the window
beside Ariel Together they watched the shabby little figure cross the
street below and she felt an infinite pathos gathering about it as it
paused for a moment hesitating underneath the arclamp at the corner
They saw the white face lifted as Happy Fear gave one last look about
him then he set his shoulders sturdily and steadfastly entered the
door of the jail

Joe took a deep breath Now well go he said I must be quick

What was it she asked tremulously as they reached the street
Can you tell me

Nothingjust an old story

He had not offered her his arm but walked on hurriedly a pace ahead
of her though she came as rapidly as she could She put her hand
rather timidly on his sleeve and without need of more words from her
he understood her insistence

That was the husband of the woman who told you her story he said
Perhaps it would shock you less if I tell you now than if you heard it
tomorrow as you will Hes just shot the other man

Killed him she gasped

Yes he answered He wanted to run away but I wouldnt let him
He has my word that Ill clear him and I made him give himself up



XVI

THE TWO CANAANS

When Joe left Ariel at Judge Pikes gate she lingered there her elbows
upon the uppermost crossbar like a village girl at twilight watching
his thin figure vanish into the heavy shadow of the maples then emerge
momentarily ghostgray and rapid at the lighted crossing down the
street to disappear again under the trees beyond followed a second
later by a brownish streak as the mongrel heeled after him When they
had passed the second corner she could no longer be certain of them
although the street was straight with flat draughtsmanlike Western
directness both figures and Joes quick footsteps merging with the
night Still she did not turn to go did not alter her position nor
cease to gaze down the dim street Few lights shone almost all the
windows of the houses were darkened and save for the summer murmurs
the faint creak of upper branches and the infinitesimal voices of
insects in the grass there was silence the pleasant and somnolent
hush swathed in which that part of Canaan crosses to the far side of
the eleventh hour

But Ariel not soothed by this balm sought beyond it to see that
unquiet Canaan whither her old friend bent his steps and found his
labor and his dwelling that other Canaan where peace did not fall
comfortably with the coming of night a place as alien in habit in
thought and almost in speech as if it had been upon another continent
And yetso strange is the duality of townsit lay but a few blocks
distant

Here about Ariel as she stood at the gate of the Pike Mansion the
houses of the good secure of salvation and daily bread were closed
and quiet as safely shut and sound asleep as the churches but deeper
in the town there was light and life and merry evil
industryscreened but strong to last until morning there were
haunts of haggard merriment in plenty surreptitious chambers where
roulettewheels swam beneath dizzied eyes illfavored bars reached by
devious ways where quavering voices offered song and were harshly
checked and through the burdened air of this Canaan wandered heavy
smells of musk like that upon Happy Fears wife who must now be so
pale beneath her rouge And above all this and for all this and
because of all this was that one resort to which Joe now made his way
that haven whose lights burn all night long whose doors are never
closed but are open from dawn until dawnthe jail

There in that desolate refuge lay Happy Fear surrendered sturdily by
himself at Joes word The picture of the little man was clear and
fresh in Ariels eyes and though she had seen him when he was newly
come from a thing so terrible that she could not realize it as a fact
she felt only an overwhelming pity for him She was not even
horrorstricken though she had shuddered The pathos of the shabby
little figure crossing the street toward the lighted doors had touched
her Something about him had appealed to her for he had not seemed
wicked his face was not cruel though it was desperate Perhaps it
was partly his very desperation which had moved her She had
understood Joe when he told her that this man was his friend and
comprehended his great fear when he said Ive got to clear him I
promised him

Over and over Joe had reiterated Ive got to save him Ive got
to She had answered gently Yes Joe hurrying to keep up with
him Hes a good man he said Ive known few better given his
chances And none of this would have happened except for his oldtime
friendship for me It was his loyaltyoh the rarest and absurdest
loyaltythat made the first trouble between him and the man he shot
Ive got to clear him

Will it be hard

They may make it so I can only see part of it surely When his wife
left the office she met Cory on the street You saw what a pitiful
kind of fool she was irresponsible and helpless and featherbrained
There are thousands of women like that everywheresome of them are
Court Beauties I dare sayand they always mix things up but they
are most dangerous when theyre like Claudine because then they live
among men of action like Cory and Fear Cory was artful he spent the
day about town telling people that he had always liked Happy that his
ill feeling of yesterday was all gone he wanted to find him and shake
his hand bury past troubles and be friends I think he told Claudine
the same thing when they met and convinced the tiny brainlet of his
sincerity Cory was a man who had a way with him and I can see
Claudine flattered at the idea of being peacemaker between two such
nice genlemen as Mr Cory and Mr Fear Her commonest
asseverationquite genuine toois that she doesnt like to have the
genlemen making trouble about her So the poor imbecile led him to
where her husband was waiting All that Happy knew of this was in her
cry afterwards He was sitting alone when Cory threw open the door
and said Ive got you this time Happy His pistol was raised but
never fired He waited too long meaning to establish his case of
selfdefence and Fear is the quickest man I know Cory fell just
inside the door Claudine stumbled upon him as she came running after
him crying out to her husband that she never meant no trouble that
Cory had sworn to her that he only wanted to shake hands and make up
Other people heard the shot and broke into the room but they did not
try to stop Fear he warned them off and walked out without hindrance
and came to me Ive got to clear him

Ariel knew what he meant she realized the actual thing as it was and
though possessed by a strange feeling that it must all be medieval and
not possibly of today understood that he would have to fight to keep
his friend from being killed that the unhappy creature who had run
into the office out of the dark stood in high danger of having his neck
broken unless Joe could help him He made it clear to her that the
State would kill Happy if it could that it would be a point of pride
with certain deliberate men holding office to take the life of the
little man that if they did secure his death it would be set down to
their efficiency and was even competent as campaign material I wish
to point out Joe had heard a candidate for reelection vehemently
orate that in addition to the other successful convictions I have
named I and my assistants have achieved the sending of three men to
the gallows during my term of office

I cant tell yet said Joe at parting It may be hard Im so
sorry you saw all this I

Oh NO she cried I want to UNDERSTAND


She was still there at the gate her elbows resting upon the
crossbar when a long time after Joe had gone there came from the
alley behind the big back yard the minor chordings of a quartette of
those dark strollers who never seem to go to bed who play by night and
playfully pretend to work by day

 You know my soul is afull o thematrubbils
 Evry mawn
 I cain awalk withouten I stumbils
 Then less go on
 Keep walkin on
 These times is sowowful an I am powowful
 Sick an folawn


She heard a step upon the path behind her and turning saw a
whitewrapped figure coming toward her

Mamie she called

Hush Mamie lifted a warning hand The windows are open she
whispered They might hear you

Why havent you gone to bed

Oh dont you see Mamie answered in deep distressIve been
sitting up for you We all thought you were writing letters in your
room but after papa and mamma had gone to bed I went in to tell you
good night and you werent there nor anywhere else so I knew you
must have gone out Ive been sitting by the front window waiting to
let you in but I went to sleep until a little while ago when the
telephonebell rang and he got up and answered it He kept talking a
long time it was something about the Tocsin and Im afraid theres
been a murder downtown When he went back to bed I fell asleep again
and then those darkies woke me up How on earth did you expect to get
in Dont you know he always locks up the house

I could have rung said Ariel

Ohoh gasped Miss Pike and after she had recovered somewhat
asked Do you mind telling me where youve been I wont tell
himnor mamma either I think after all I was wrong yesterday to
follow Eugenes advice He meant for the best but I

Dont think that You werent wrong Ariel put her arm round the
others waist I went to talk over some things with Mr Louden

I think whispered Mamie trembling that you are the bravest girl I
ever knewandandI could almost believe theres some good in him
since you like him so I know there is And II think hes had a
hard time I want you to know I wont even tell Eugene

You can tell everybody in the world said Ariel and kissed her



XVII

MR SHEEHANS HINTS

Never said the Tocsin on the morrow has this community been
stirred to deeper indignation than by the coldblooded and unmitigated
brutality of the deliberate murder committed almost under the very
shadow of the Courthouse cupola last night The victim was not a man
of good repute it is true but at the moment of his death he was in
the act of performing a noble and generous action which showed that he
might have become if he lived a good and lawfearing citizen In
brief he went to forgive his enemy and was stretching forth the hand
of fellowship when that enemy shot him down Not half an hour before
his death Cory had repeated within the hearing of a dozen men what he
had been saying all day as many can testify I want to find my old
friend Fear and shake hands with him I want to tell him that I
forgive him and that I am ashamed of whatever has been my part in the
trouble between us He went with that intention to his death The
wife of the murderer has confessed that this was the substance of what
he said to her and that she was convinced of his peaceful intentions
When they reached the room where her husband was waiting for her Cory
entered first The woman claims now that as they neared the vicinity
he hastened forward at a pace which she could not equal Naturally
her testimony on all points favoring her husband is practically
worthless She followed and heard the murdered man speak though what
his words were she declares she does not know and of course the
murderer after consultation with his lawyer claims that their nature
was threatening Such a statement in determining the truth is worse
than valueless It is known and readily proved that Fear repeatedly
threatened the deceaseds life yesterday and there is no question in
the mind of any man woman or child who reads these words of the
cold blooded nature of the crime The slayer who had formerly made a
murderous attack upon his victim lately quarrelled with him and
uttered threats as we have stated upon his life The dead man came
to him with protestations of friendship and was struck down a corpse
It is understood that the defence will in desperation set up the theory
of selfdefence based on an unsubstantiated claim that Cory entered
the room with a drawn pistol No pistol was found in the room The
weapon with which the deed was accomplished was found upon the person
of the murderer when he was seized by the police one chamber
discharged Another revolver was discovered upon the person of the
woman when she was arrested on the scene of the crime This upon
being strictly interrogated she said she had picked up from the floor
in the confusion thinking it was her husbands and hoping to conceal
it The chambers were full and undischarged and we have heard it
surmised that the defence means to claim that it was Corys Cory
doubtless went on his errand of forgiveness unarmed and beyond doubt
the second weapon belonged to the woman herself who has an unenviable
record

The point of it all is plainly this here is an unquestionable murder
in the first degree and the people of this city and county are
outraged and incensed that such a crime should have been committed in
their lawabiding and respectable community With whom does the fault
lie On whose head is this murder Not with the authorities for they
do not countenance crime Has it come to the pass that counting on
juggleries of the law criminals believe that they may kill maim
burn and slay as they list without punishment Is this to be another
instance of the laws delays and immunity for a hideous crime
compassed by a cunning and cynical trickster of legal technicalities
The people of Canaan cry out for a speedy trial speedy conviction and
speedy punishment of this coldblooded and murderous monster If he is
not dealt with quickly according to his deserts the climax is upon us
and the limit of Canaans patience has been reached

One last word and we shall be glad to have its significance noted J
Louden Esq has been retained for the defence The murderer before
being apprehended by the authorities WENT STRAIGHT FROM THE SCENE OF
HIS CRIME TO PLACE HIS RETAINER IN HIS ATTORNEYS POCKET HOW LONG IS
THIS TO LAST


The Tocsin was quoted on street corners that morning in shop and store
and office wherever people talked of the Cory murder and that was
everywhere for the people of Canaan and of the country roundabout
talked of nothing else Women chattered of it in parlor and kitchen
men gathered in small groups on the street and shook their heads
ominously over it farmers meeting on the road halted their teams and
loudly damned the little man in the Canaan jail milkmen lingered on
back porches over their cans to agree with cooks that it was an awful
thing and that if ever any man deserved hanging that there Fear
deserved ithis lawyer along with him Tipsy men hammered bars with
fists and beerglasses inquiring if there was no rope to be had in the
town and Joe Louden returning to his office from the little
restaurant where he sometimes ate his breakfast heard hisses following
him along Main Street A clerk a fatshouldered blueaproned
pimplecheeked youth stood in the open doors of a grocery and as he
passed stared him in the face and said Yah with supreme disgust

Joe stopped Why he asked mildly

The clerk put two fingers in his mouth and whistled shrilly in
derision Youd ort to be run out o town he exclaimed

I believe said Joe that we have never met before

Go on you shyster

Joe looked at him gravely My dear sir he returned you speak to
me with the familiarity of an old friend

The clerk did not recover so far as to be capable of repartee until Joe
had entered his own stairway Then with a bitter sneer he seized a
bad potato from an open barrel and threw it at the mongrel who had
paused to examine the landscape The missile failed and
Respectability after bestowing a slightly injured look upon the clerk
followed his master

In the office the redbearded man sat waiting Not so redbearded as of
yore however was Mr Sheehan but grizzled and gray and this
morning gray of face too as he sat perspiring and anxious wiping a
troubled brow with a black silk handkerchief

Heres the devil and all to pay at last Joe he said uneasily on
the others entrance This is the worst I ever knew and I hate to
say it but I doubt yer pullin it off

Ive got to Mike

I hope on my soul theres a chanst of it I like the little man Joe

So do I

I know ye do my boy But heres this Tocsin kickin up the public
sentiment and if there ever was a follerin sheep on earth its that
same public sentiment

If it werent for thatJoe flung himself heavily in a
chairthered not be so much trouble Its a clear enough case

But dont ye see interrupted Sheehan the Tocsins tried it and
convicted him aforehand And that if things keep goin the way theyve
started today the gran jurys bound to indict him and the trial
jury to convict him They wouldnt dare not to Whats more theyll
want to And theyll rush the trial summer or no summer and

I know I know

Ill tell ye one thing said the other wiping his forehead with the
black handkerchief and thats this my boy last nights business has
just about put the cap on the Beach fer me Im sick of it and Im
tired of it Im ready to quit sir

Joe looked at him sharply Dont you think my old notion of what
might be done could be made to pay

Sheehan laughed Whoo You and yer hints Joe How long past have
ye come around me with em I blieve ye cd make more money
Mikethats the way yed put itif ye altered the Beach a bit
Make a little countryside restaurant of it yed say and have good
cookin and keep the boys and girls from raisin so much hell out
there Soon yed have other people comin beside the regular crowd
Make a little garden on the shore and let em eat at tables under
trees an grapearbors

Well why not asked Joe

Havent I been tellin ye Im thinkin of it Its only yer way of
hintin thats funny to meyer way of sayin Id make more money
because yere afraid of preachin at any of us partly because ye know
the little good it d be and partly because ye have humor Well Im
thinkin yell git yer way IM willin to go into the missionary
business with ye

Mike said Joe angrily but he grew very red and failed to meet the
others eye Im not

Yes ye are cried Sheehan Yes sir Its a thing ye probly
havent had the nerve to say to yerself since a boy but thats yer
notion inside yere little better than a missionary It took me a
long while to understand what was drivin ye but I do now And yeve
gone the right way about it because we know yell stand fer us when
were in trouble and fight fer us till we git a square deal as yere
goin to fight for Happy now

Joe looked deeply troubled Never mind he said crossly and with
visible embarrassment You think you couldnt make more at the Beach
if you ran it on my plan

Im game to try said Sheehan slowly Im too old to hold em down
out there the way I yoosta could and Im sick of itsick of it into
the very bones of me He wiped his forehead Wheres Claudine

Held as a witness

Im not sorry fer HER said the redbearded man emphatically
Women o that kind are so lightheaded its a wonder they dont float
Think of her pickin up Corys gun from the floor and hidin it in her
clothes Took it fer granted it was Happys and thought shed help
him by hidin it Theres a hard point fer ye Joe to prove the gun
belonged to Cory Theres nobody about here could swear to it I
couldnt myself though I forced him to stick it back in his pocket
yesterday He was a wanderer too and yell have to send a keen one to
trace him Im thinkin to find where he got it sos ye can show it
in court

Im going myself Ive found out that he came here from Denver

And from where before that

I dont know but Ill keep on travelling till I get what I want

Thats right my boy exclaimed the other heartily It may be a
long trip but yere all the little man has to depend on Did ye
notice the Tocsin didnt even give him the credit fer givin himself
up

Yes said Joe Its part of their game

Did it strike ye now Mr Sheehan asked earnestly leaning forward
in his chairdid it strike ye that the Tocsin was aimin more to do
Happy harm because of you than himself

Yes Joe looked sadly out of the window Ive thought that over
and it seemed possible that I might do Happy more good by giving his
case to some other lawyer

No sir exclaimed the proprietor of Beaver Beach loudly Theyve
begun their attack theyre bound to keep it up and theyd manage to
turn it to the discredit of both of ye Besides Happy wouldnt have
no other lawyer hed ruther be hung with you fightin fer him than be
cleared by anybody else I blieve iton my soul I do But look
here he went on leaning still farther forward I want to know if it
struck ye that this morning the Tocsin attacked ye in a way that was
somehow vilenter than ever before

Yes replied Joe because it was aimed to strike where it would most
count

It aint only that said the other excitedly It aint only that
I want ye to listen Now see here the Tocsin is Pike and the town is
PikeI mean the town ye naturally belonged to Aint it

In a way I supposeyes

In a way echoed the other scornfully Ye know it is Even as a
boy Pike disliked ye and hated the kind of a boy ye was Ye wasnt
respectable and he was Ye wasnt rich and he was Ye had a grin on
yer face when yed meet him on the street The redbearded man broke
off at a gesture from Joe and exclaimed sharply Dont deny it _I_
know what ye was like Ye wasnt impudent but ye looked at him as if
ye saw through him Now listen and Ill lead ye somewhere Ye run
with riffraff naggers and evenMr Sheehan lifted a forefinger
solemnly and shook it at his auditorand even with the Irish Now I
ask ye this yeve had one part of Canaan with ye from the start MY
part that is but the others against ye that parts PIKE and its
the rulin part

Yes Mike said Joe wearily In the spirit of things I know

No sir cried the other Thats the trouble ye dont know
Theres more in Canaan than yeve understood Listen to this Why was
the Tocsins attack harder this morning than ever before On yer soul
didnt it sound so bitter that it sounded desprit Now why It looked
to me as if it had started to ruin ye this time fer good and all Why
What have ye had to do with Martin Pike lately Has the old wolf GOT
to injure ye Mr Sheehans voice rose and his eyes gleamed under
bushy brows Think he finished Whats happened lately to make
him bite so hard

There were some faded roses on the desk and as Joes haggard eyes fell
upon them the answer came What makes you think Judge Pike isnt
trustworthy he had asked Ariel and her reply had been Nothing
very definite unless it was his look when I told him that I meant to
ask you to take charge of things for me

He got slowly and amazedly to his feet Youve got it he said

Ye see cried Mike Sheehan slapping his thigh with a big hand On
my soul I have the penetration Ye dont need to tell me one thing
except this I told ye Id lead ye somewhere havent I kept me word

Yes said Joe

But I have the penetration exclaimed Mr Sheehan Should I miss my
guess if I said that ye think Pike may be scared yell stumble on his
track in some queer performances Should I miss it

No said Joe You wouldnt miss it

Just one thing more The redbearded man rose mopping the inner
band of his straw hat In the matter of yer runnin fer Mayor now

Joe who had begun to pace up and down the room made an impatient
gesture Pshaw he interrupted but his friend stopped him with a
hand laid on his arm

Dont be treatin it as clean out of all possibility Joe Louden If
ye do it shows ye havent sense to know that nobody can say what way
the winds blowin week after next All the boys want ye Louie
Farbach wants ye and Louie has a big say Who is it that doesnt want
ye

Canaan said Joe

Hold up Its Pikes Canaan ye mean If ye git the nomination yed
be elected wouldnt ye

I couldnt be nominated

I aint claimin yed git Martin Pikes vote returned Mr Sheehan
sharply though I dont say its impossible Yeve got to beat him
thats all Yeve got to do to him what hes done to YOU and what
hes tryin to do now worse than ever before Wellthere may be ways
to do it and if he tempts me enough I may fergit my troth and honor
as a noble gentleman and help ye with a word yed never guess yerself

Youve hinted at such mysteries before Mike Joe smiled Id be
glad to know what you mean if theres anything in them

It may come to that said the other with some embarrassment It
may come to that some day if the old wolf presses me too hard in the
matter o tryin to git the little man across the street hanged by the
neck and yerself mobbed fer helpin him But today Ill say no more

Very well Mike Joe turned wearily to his desk I dont want you
to break any promises

Mr Sheehan had gone to the door but he paused on the threshold and
wiped his forehead again

And I dont want to break any he said but if ever the time should
come when I couldnt help ithe lowered his voice to a hoarse but
piercing whisperthat will be the devourin angels day fer Martin
Pike



XVIII

IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY

It was a morning of the warmest week of midJuly and Canaan lay inert
and helpless beneath a broiling sun The few people who moved about the
streets went languidly keeping close to the wall on the shady side
the women in thin white fabrics the men often coatless carrying
palmleaf fans and replacing collars with handkerchiefs In the
Courthouse yard the maple leaves gray with blown dust and grown to
great breadth drooped heavily depressing the long motionless
branches with their weight so low that the four or five shabby idlers
upon the benches beneath now and then flicked them sleepily with
whittled sprigs The doors and windows of the stores stood open
displaying limp wares of trade but few tokens of life the clerks
hanging over dim counters as far as possible from the glare in front
gossiping fragmentarily usually about the Cory murder and anon upon
a subject suggested by the sight of an occasional pedestrian passing
perspiring by with scrooged eyelids and purpling skin From street and
sidewalk transparent hot waves swam up and danced themselves into
nothing while from the river bank a halfmile away came a sound
hotter than even the locusts midsummer rasp the drone of a
planingmill A chance boy lying prone in the grass of the
Courthouse yard was annoyed by the relentless chant and lifted his
head to mock it AWREERAWREER SHUT UP CANT YOU The effort
was exhausting he relapsed and suffered with increasing malice but in
silence

Abruptly there was a violent outbreak on the National House corner
as when a quiet farmhouse is startled by some ones inadvertently
bringing down all the tin from a shelf in the pantry The loafers on
the benches turned hopefully saw what it was then closed their eyes
and slumped back into their former positions The outbreak subsided as
suddenly as it had arisen Colonel Flitcroft pulled Mr Arp down into
his chair again and it was all over

Greater heat than that of these blazing days could not have kept one of
the sages from attending the conclave now For the battle was on in
Canaan and here upon the National House corner under the shadow of
the west wall it waxed even keener Perhaps we may find full
justification for calling what was happening a battle in so far as we
restrict the figure to apply to this one spot else where in the
Canaan of the Tocsin the conflict was too onesided The Tocsin had
indeed tried the case of Happy Fear in advance had convicted and
condemned and every day grew more bitter Nor was the urgent vigor of
its attack without effect Sleepy as Main Street seemed in the heat
the town was incensed and roused to a tensity of feeling it had not
known since the civil war when on occasion it had set out to hang
half a dozen Knights of the Golden Circle Joe had been hissed on
the street many times since the inimical clerk had whistled at him
Probably demonstrations of that sort would have continued had he
remained in Canaan but for almost a month he had been absent and his
office closed its threshold gray with dust There were people who
believed that he had run away again this time never to return among
those who held to this opinion being Mrs Louden and her sister Joes
stepaunt Upon only one point was everybody agreed that twelve men
could not be found in the county who could be so far persuaded and
befuddled by Louden that they would dare to allow Happy Fear to escape
The women of Canaan incensed by the terrible circumstance of the case
as the Tocsin colored ita man shot down in the act of begging his
enemys forgivenessclamored as loudly as the men there was only the
difference that the latter vociferated for the hanging of Happy their
good ladies used the word punishment

And yet while the place rang with condemnation of the little man in
the jail and his attorney there were voices here and there uplifted
on the other side People existed it astonishingly appeared who
LIKED Happy Fear These were for the greater part obscure and even
darkling in their lives yet quite demonstrably human beings able to
smile suffer leap run and to entertain fancies even to have
according to their degree a certain rudimentary sense of right and
wrong in spite of which they strongly favored the prisoners
acquittal Precisely on that account it was argued an acquittal would
outrage Canaan and lay it open to untold danger such people needed a
lesson

The Tocsin interviewed the towns great ones printing their opinions
of the heinousness of the crime and the character of the defendants
lawyer The Hon P J Parrott who so ably represented this county
in the Legislature some fourteen years ago could scarcely restrain
himself when approached by a reporter as to his sentiments anent the
repulsive deed I should like to know how long Canaan is going to put
up with this sort of business were his words I am a lawabiding
citizen and I have served faithfully and with my full endeavor and
ability to enact the laws and statutes of my State but there is a
point in my patience I would state which lawbreakers and their
lawyers may not safely pass Of what use are our most solemn
enactments I may even ask of what use is the Legislature itself
chosen by the will of the people if they are to ruthlessly be set
aside by criminals and their shifty protectors The blame should be put
upon the lawyers who by tricks enable such rascals to escape the rigors
of the carefully enacted laws the fruits of the Solons labor more
than upon the criminals themselves In this case if there is any
miscarriage of justice I will say here and now that in my opinion the
people of this county will be sorely tempted and while I do not
believe in lynchlaw yet if that should be the result it is my
unalterable conviction that the vigilantes may well turn their
attention to the lawyersOR LAWYERwho bring about such miscarriage
I am sick of it

The Tocsin did not print the interview it obtained from Louie
Farbachthe same Louie Farbach who long ago had owned a beersaloon
with a little room behind the bar where a shabby boy sometimes played
dominoes and sevenup with loafers not quite the same Louie Farbach
however in outward circumstance for he was now the brewer of Farbach
Beer and making Canaan famous His rise had been Teutonic and sure
and he contributed onetwentieth of his income to the German Orphan
Asylum and onetenth to his partys campaign fund The twentieth saved
the orphans from the county while the tithe gave the county to his
party

He occupied a kitchen chair enjoying the society of some chickens in a
wired enclosure behind the new Italian villa he had erected in that
part of Canaan where he would be most uncomfortable and he looked
woodenly at the reporter when the latter put his question

Hef you any aguaintunce off Mitster Fear he inquired in return
with no expression decipherable either upon his Gargantuan face or in
his heavily enfolded eyes

No sir replied the reporter grinning I never ran across him

Dot iss a goot ting fer you said Mr Farbach stonily He iss not
a man peobles bedder try to run across It iss what Gory tried Now
Gory iss dead

The reporter slightly puzzled lit a cigarette See here Mr
Farbach he urged I only want a word or two about this thing and
you might give me a brief expression concerning that man Louden
besides just a hint of what you think of his influence here you know
and of the kind of sharp work he practises Something like that

I see said the brewer slowly Happy Fear I hef knowt for a goot
many years He iss a goot frient of mine

What

Choe Louten iss a bedder one continued Mr Farbach turning again to
stare at his chickens

Git owit

What

Git owit repeated the other without passion without anger without
any expression whatsoever Git owit

The reporters prejudice against the German nation dated from that
moment

There were others here and there who were less selfcontained than
the brewer A farmhand struck a fellow laborer in the harvestfield
for speaking ill of Joe and the unravelling of a strange street fight
one day disclosed as its cause a like resentment on the part of a
blind broommaker engendered by a like offence The broommakers
companion reading the Tocsin as the two walked together had begun the
quarrel by remarking that Happy Fear ought to be hanged once for his
own sake and twice more to show up that shyster Louden Warm words
followed leading to extremely material conflict in which in spite of
his blindness the broommaker had so much the best of it that he was
removed from the triumphant attitude he had assumed toward the person
of his adversary which was an admirable imitation of the dismounted
St George and the Dragon and conveyed to the jail Keenest
investigation failed to reveal anything oblique in the mans record to
the astonishment of Canaan there was nothing against him He was
blind and moderately poor but a respectable hardworking artisan and
a pride to the church in which he was what has been called an active
worker It was discovered that his sensitiveness to his companions
attack on Joseph Louden arose from the fact that Joe had obtained the
acquittal of an imbecile sister of the blind man a twothirdswitted
woman who had been charged with bigamy

The Tocsin made what it could of this and so dexterously that the
wrath of Canaan was one farther jot increased against the shyster Ay
the town was hot inside and out

Let us consider the Forum Was there ever before such a summer for the
National House corner How voices first thundered there then
cracked and piped is not to be rendered in all the tales of the
fathers One who would make vivid the great doings must indeed dip
his brush in earthquake and eclipse even then he could but picture
the credible and must despair of this the silence of Eskew Arp Not
that Eskew held his tongue not that he was chary of speechno O
tempora O mores NO But that he refused the subject in hand that
he eschewed expression upon it and resolutely drove the argument in
other directions that he achieved such superbly unArplike
inconsistency and with such rich material for his sardonic humors not
at arms length not even so far as his fingertips but beneath his
very palms he rejected it this was the impossible fact

Eskewthere is no option but to declarewas no longer Eskew It is
the truth since the morning when Ariel Tabor came down from Joes
office leaving her offering of white roses in that dingy dusty shady
place Eskew had not been himself His comrades observed it somewhat in
a physical difference one of those alterations which may come upon men
of his years suddenly like a sea change his face was whiter his
walk slower his voice filed thinner he creaked louder when he rose or
sat Old always from his boyhood he had in the turn of a hand
become aged But such things come and such things go after eighty
there are ups and downs people fading away one week bloom out
pleasantly the next and resiliency is not at all a patent belonging to
youth alone The material change in Mr Arp might have been thought
little worth remarking What caused Peter Bradbury Squire Buckalew
and the Colonel to shake their heads secretly to one another and wonder
if their good old friends mind had not begun to go was something
very different To come straight down to it he not only abstained
from all argument upon the Cory Murder and the case of Happy Fear
refusing to discuss either in any terms or under any circumstances but
he also declined to speak of Ariel Tabor or of Joseph Louden or of
their affairs singular or plural masculine feminine or neuter or
in any declension Not a word committal or noncommittal None

And his face when he was silent fell into sorrowful and troubled
lines

At first they merely marvelled Then Squire Buckalew dared to tempt
him Eskews faded eyes showed a blue gleam but he withstood
speaking of Babylon to the disparagement of Chicago They sought to
lead him into what he evidently would not employing many devices but
the old man was wily and often carried them far afield by secret ways
of his own This hot morning he had done that thing they were close
upon him pressing him hard when he roused that outburst which had
stirred the idlers on the benches in the Courthouse yard Squire
Buckalew sidelong at the others but squarely at Eskew had volunteered
the information that Cory was a reformed priest Stung by the mystery
of Eskews silence the Squires imagination had become magically
gymnastic and if anything under heaven could have lifted the veil
this was the thing Mr Arps reply may be reverenced

I consider he said deliberately that James G Blaines furrin
policy was childish and whats more I never thought much of HIM

This outdefied Ajax and every trace of the matter in hand went to the
four winds Eskew like Rome was saved by a cackle in which he
joined and a few moments later as the bench loafers saw was pulled
down into his seat by the Colonel

The voices of the fathers fell to the pitch of ordinary discourse the
drowsy town was quiet again the whine of the planingmill boring its
way through the sizzling air to every wakening ear Far away on a
quiet street it sounded faintly like the hum of a bee across a creek
and was drowned in the noise of men at work on the old Tabor house It
seemed the only busy place in Canaan that day the shade of the big
beechtrees which surrounded it affording some shelter from the
destroying sun to the dripping laborers who were sawing hammering
painting plumbing papering and ripping open old and new
packingboxes There were many changes in the old house pleasantly in
keeping with its simple character airy enlargements now almost
completed so that some of the rooms were already finished and stood
furnished and immaculate ready for tenancy

In that which had been Roger Tabors studio sat Ariel alone She had
caused some chests and cases stored there to be opened and had taken
out of them a few of Rogers canvases and set them along the wall
Tears filled her eyes as she looked at them seeing the tragedy of
labor the old man had expended upon them but she felt the recompense
hard tight literal as they were he had had his moment of joy in each
of them before he saw them coldly and knew the truth And he had been
given his years of Paris at last and had seen how the other fellows
did it

A heavy foot strode through the hall coming abruptly to a halt in the
doorway and turning she discovered Martin Pike his big
HenrytheEighth face flushed more with anger than with the heat His
hat was upon his head and remained there nor did he offer any token
or word of greeting whatever but demanded to know when the work upon
the house had been begun

The second morning after my return she answered

I want to know he pursued why it was kept secret from me and I
want to know quick

Secret she echoed with a wave of her hand to indicate the noise
which the workmen were making

Upon whose authority was it begun

Mine Who else could give it

Look here he said advancing toward her dont you try to fool me
You havent done all this by yourself Who hired these workmen

Remembering her first interview with him she rose quickly before he
could come near her Mr Louden made most of the arrangements for
me she replied quietly before he went away He will take charge
of everything when he returns You havent forgotten that I told you I
intended to place my affairs in his hands

He had started forward but at this he stopped and stared at her
inarticulately

You remember she said her hands resting negligently upon the back
of the chair Surely you remember

She was not in the least afraid of him but coolly watchful of him
This had been her habit with him since her return She had seen little
of him except at table when he was usually grimly laconic though now
and then she would hear him joking heavily with Sam Warden in the yard
or with evidently humorous intent groaning at Mamie over Eugenes
health but it had not escaped Ariel that he was on his part watchful
of herself and upon his guard with a wariness in which she was
sometimes surprised to believe that she saw an almost haggard
apprehension

He did not answer her question and it seemed to her as she continued
steadily to meet his hot eyes that he was trying to hold himself under
some measure of control and a vain effort it proved

You go back to my house he burst out shouting hoarsely You get
back there You stay there

No she said moving between him and the door Mamie and I are
going for a drive

You go back to my house He followed her waving an arm fiercely at
her Dont you come around here trying to run over me You talk
about your affairs All youve got on earth is this twoforanickel
old shack over your head and a bushelbasket of distillery stock that
you can sell by the pound for old paper He threw the words in her
face the bullbass voice seamed and cracked with falsetto Old
paper old rags old iron bottles old clothes You talk about your
affairs Who are you Rothschild You havent GOT any affairs

Not a look not a word not a motion of his escaped her in all the fury
of sound and gesture in which he seemed fairly to envelop himself
least of all did that shaking of histhe quivering of jaw and temple
the tumultuous agitation of his handsevade her watchfulness

When did you find this out she said very quickly After you
became administrator

He struck the back of the chair she had vacated a vicious blow with his
open hand No you spendthrift All there was TO your grandfather
when you buried him was a basket full of distillery stock I tell you
Old paper Cant you hear me Old paper old rags

You have sent me the same income she lifted her voice to interrupt
you have made the same quarterly payments since his death that you
made before If you knew why did you do that

He had been shouting at her with the frantic and incredulous
exasperation of an intolerant man utterly unused to opposition his
face empurpled his forehead dripping and his hands ruthlessly
pounding the back of the chair but this straight question stripped him
suddenly of gesture and left him standing limp and still before her
pale splotches beginning to show on his hot cheeks

If you knew why did you do it she repeated You wrote me that my
income was from dividends and I knew and thought nothing about it but
if the stock which came to me was worthless how could it pay
dividends

It did not he answered huskily That distillery stock I tell
you isnt worth the matches to burn it

But there has been no difference in my income she persisted
steadily Why Can you explain that to me

Yes I can he replied and it seemed to her that he spoke with a
pallid and bitter desperation like a man driven to the wall I can
if you think you want to know

I do

I sent it

Do you mean from you own

I mean it was my own money

She had not taken her eyes from his which met hers straightly and
angrily and at this she leaned forward gazing at him with profound
scrutiny

Why did you send it she asked

Charity he answered after palpable hesitation

Her eyes widened and she leaned back against the lintel of the door
staring at him incredulously Charity she echoed in a whisper

Perhaps he mistook her amazement at his performance for dismay caused
by the sense of her own position for as she seemed to weaken before
him the strength of his own habit of dominance came back to him
Charity madam he broke out shouting intolerably Charity dye
hear I was a friend of the man that made the money you and your
grandfather squandered I was a friend of Jonas Tabor I say Thats
why I was willing to support you for a year and over rather than let a
niece of his suffer

Suffer she cried Support You sent me a hundred thousand
francs

The white splotches which had mottled Martin Pikes face disappeared as
if they had been suddenly splashed with hot red You go back to my
house he said What I sent you only shows the extent of my

Effrontery The word rang through the whole house so loudly and
clearly did she strike it rang in his ears till it stung like a
castigation It was ominous portentous of justice and of disaster
There was more than doubt of him in it there was conviction

He fell back from this word and when he again advanced Ariel had left
the house She had turned the next corner before he came out of the
gate and as he passed his own home on his way downtown he saw her
white dress mingling with his daughters near the horseblock beside
the fire where the two with their arms about each other stood
waiting for Sam Warden and the open summer carriage

Judge Pike walked on the white splotches reappearing like a pale rash
upon his face A yellow butterfly zigzagged before him kneehigh
across the sidewalk He raised his foot and half kicked at it

ESKEW ARP

As the Judge continued his walk down Main Street he wished profoundly
that the butterfly which exhibited no annoyance had been of greater
bulk and more approachable and it was the evil fortune of Joes
mongrel to encounter him in the sinister humor of such a wish
unfulfilled Respectability dwelt at Beaver Beach under the care of Mr
Sheehan until his master should return and Sheehan was kind but the
small dog found the world lonely and time long without Joe He had
grown more and more restless and at last this hot morning having
managed to evade the eye of all concerned in his keeping made off
unobtrusively partly by swimming and reaching the road cantered into
town his ears erect with anxiety Bent upon reaching the familiar
office he passed the grocery from the doorway of which the pimply
cheeked clerk had thrown a bad potato at him a month before The same
clerk had just laid down the Tocsin as Respectability went by and
inspired to great deeds in behalf of justice and his native city he
rushed to the door lavishly seized this time a perfectly good
potato and hurled it with a result which ecstasized him for it took
the mongrel fairly aside the head which it matched in size

The luckless Respectabilitys purpose to reach Joes stairway had been
entirely definite but upon this violence he forgot it momentarily It
is not easy to keep things in mind when one is violently smitten on
mouth nose cheek eye and ear by a missile large enough to strike
them simultaneously Yelping and half blinded he deflected to cross
Main Street Judge Pike had elected to cross in the opposite
direction and the two met in the middle of the street

The encounter was miraculously fitted to the Judges need here was no
butterfly but a solid body light withal a wet muddy and dusty
yellow dog eminently kickable The man was heavily built about the
legs and the vigor of what he did may have been additionally inspired
by his recognition of the mongrel as Joe Loudens The impact of his
toe upon the little runners side was momentous and the latter rose
into the air The Judge hopped as one hops who unshod in the night
discovers an unexpected chair Let us be reconciled to his pain and
not reproach the gods with itfor two of his unintending adversarys
ribs were cracked

The dog thus again deflected retraced his tracks shrieking
distractedly and by one of those ironical twists which Karma reserves
for the tails of the fated dived for blind safety into the store
commanded by the ecstatic and inimical clerk There were shouts the
sleepy Square beginning to wake up the boy who had mocked the
planingmill got to his feet calling upon his fellows the bench
loafers strolled to the street the aged men stirred and rose from
their chairs faces appeared in the open windows of offices sales
ladies and gentlemen came to the doorways of the tradingplaces so
that when Respectability emerged from the grocery he had a notable
audience for the scene he enacted with a brass dinnerbell tied to his
tail

Another potato flung by the pimpled uproarious prodigal clerk added
to the impetus of his flight A shower of pebbles from the hands of
exhilarated boys dented the soft asphalt about him the hideous clamor
of the pursuing bell increased as he turned the next corner running
distractedly The dead town had come to life and its inhabitants
gladly risked the dangerous heat in the interests of sport whereby it
was a merry chase the little dog led around the block For thus some
destructive instinct drove him he could not stop with the unappeasable
Terror clanging at his heels and the increasing crowd yelling in
pursuit but he turned to the left at each corner and thus came back
to pass Joes stairway again unable to pause there or anywhere unable
to do anything except to continue his hapless flight poor meteor

Round the block he went once more and still no chance at that empty
stairway where perhaps he thought there might be succor and safety
Blood was upon his side where Martin Pikes boot had crashed foam and
blood hung upon his jaws and lolling tongue He ran desperately
keeping to the middle of the street and not howling set himself
despairingly to outstrip the Terror The mob disdaining the sun
superbly pursued as closely as it could throwing bricks and rocks at
him striking at him with clubs and sticks Happy Fear playing
tictactoe right hand against left in his cell heard the uproar
made out something of what was happening and though unaware that it
was a friend whose life was sought discovered a similarity to his own
case and prayed to his dim gods that the quarry might get away

MAD DOG they yelled MAD DOG And there were some who cried
JOE LOUDENS DOG that being equally as exciting and explanatory

Three times round and still the little fugitive maintained a lead A
grayhelmeted policeman a big fellow had joined the pursuit He had
children at home who might be playing in the street and the thought of
what might happen to them if the mad dog should head that way resolved
him to be cool and steady He was falling behind so he stopped on the
corner trusting that Respectability would come round again He was
right and the flying brownish thing streaked along Main Street
passing the beloved stairway for the fourth time The policeman lifted
his revolver fired twice missed once but caught him with the second
shot in a forepaw clipping off a fifth toe one of the small claws
that grow above the foot and are always in trouble This did not stop
him but the policeman afraid to risk another shot because of the
crowd waited for him to come again and many others seeing the
hopeless circuit the mongrel followed did likewise armed with bricks
and clubs Among them was the pimply clerk who had been inspired to
commandeer a pitchfork from a hardware store

When the fifth round came Respectabilitys race was run He turned
into Main Street at a broken speed limping parched voiceless
flecked with blood and foam snapping feebly at the showering rocks
but still indomitably a little ahead of the hunt There was no yelp
left in himhe was too thoroughly winded for thatbut in his
brilliant and despairing eyes shone the agony of a cry louder than the
tongue of a dog could utter O master O all the god I know Where
are you in my mortal need

Now indeed he had a gauntlet to run for the street was lined with
those who awaited him while the pursuit grew closer behind A number
of the hardiest stood squarely in his path and he hesitated for a
second which gave the opportunity for a surer aim and many missiles
struck him Let him have it now officer said Eugene Bantry
standing with Judge Pike at the policemans elbow Theres your
chance

But before the revolver could be discharged Respectability had begun
to run again hobbling on three legs and dodging feebly A heavy stone
struck him on the shoulder and he turned across the street making for
the National House corner where the joyful clerk brandished his
pitchfork Going slowly he almost touched the pimply one as he passed
and the clerk already rehearsing in his mind the honors which should
follow the brave stroke raised the tines above the little dogs head
for the coup de grace They did not descend and the daring youth
failed of fame as the laurel almost embraced his brows A hickory
walkingstick was thrust between his legs and he expecting to strike
received a blow upon the temple sufficient for his present undoing and
bedazzlement He went over backwards and the pitchfork not the thing
to hold poised on high when one is knocked down fell with the force he
had intended for Respectability upon his own shin

A train had pulled into the station and a tired travelworn young
man descending from a sleeper walked rapidly up the street to learn
the occasion of what appeared to be a riot When he was close enough
to understand its nature he dropped his bag and came on at top speed
shouting loudly to the battered mongrel who tried with his remaining
strength to leap toward him through a cordon of kicking legs while
Eugene Bantry again called to the policeman to fire

If he does damn you Ill kill him Joe saw the revolver raised and
then Eugene being in his way he ran fulltilt into his stepbrother
with all his force sending him to earth and went on literally over
him as he lay prone upon the asphalt that being the shortest way to
Respectability The next instant the mongrel was in his masters arms
and weakly licking his hands

But it was Eskew Arp who had saved the little dog for it was his stick
which had tripped the clerk and his hand which had struck him down
All his bodily strength had departed in that effort but he staggered
out into the street toward Joe

Joe Louden called the veteran in a loud voice Joe Louden and
suddenly reeled The Colonel and Squire Buckalew were making their way
toward him but Joe holding the dog to his breast with one arm threw
the other about Eskew

Its a townits a townthe old fellow flung himself free from the
supporting armits a town you couldnt even trust a yellow dog to

He sank back upon Joes shoulder speechless An open carriage had
driven through the crowd the colored driver urged by two ladies upon
the back seat and Martin Pike saw it stop by the group in the middle
of the street where Joe stood the wounded dog held to his breast by
one arm the old man white and half fainting supported by the other
Martin Pike saw this and more he saw Ariel Tabor and his own daughter
leaning from the carriage the arms of both pityingly extended to Joe
Louden and his two burdens while the stunned and silly crowd stood
round them staring clouds of dust settling down upon them through the
hot air

THREE ARE ENLISTED

Now in that blazing noon Canaan looked upon a strange sight an open
carriage whirling through Main Street behind two galloping bays upon
the back seat a ghostly white old man with closed eyes supported by
two pale ladies his head upon the shoulder of the taller while beside
the driver a young man whose coat and hands were bloody worked over
the hurts of an injured dog Sam Wardens whip sang across the horses
lather gathered on their flanks and Ariels voice steadily urged on
the pace Quicker Sam if you can For there was little breath
left in the body of Eskew Arp

Mamie almost as white as the old man was silent but she had not
hesitated in her daring now that she had been taught to dare she had
not come to be Ariels friend and honest follower for nothing and it
was Mamie who had cried to Joe to lift Eskew into the carriage You
must come too she said We will need you And so it came to pass
that under the eyes of Canaan Joe Louden rode in Judge Pikes carriage
at the bidding of Judge Pikes daughter

Toward Ariels own house they sped with the stricken octogenarian for
he was alone in the world and she would not take him to the cottage
where he had lived for many years by himself a bleak little house a
derelict of the early days left stranded far down in the town between
a woollenmill and the waterworks The workmen were beginning their
dinners under the big trees but as Sam Warden drew in the lathered
horses at the gate they set down their tin buckets hastily and ran to
help Joe lift the old man out Carefully they bore him into the house
and laid him upon a bed in one of the finished rooms He did not speak
or move and the workmen uncovered their heads as they went out but Joe
knew that they were mistaken Its all right Mr Arp he said as
Ariel knelt by the bed with water and restoratives Its all right
Dont you worry

Then the veterans lips twitched and though his eyes remained closed
Joe saw that Eskew understood for he gasped feebly
Positivelynofreeseats

To Mrs Louden sewing at an upstairs window the sight of her stepson
descending from Judge Pikes carriage was sufficiently startling but
when she saw Mamie Pike take Respectability from his masters arms and
carry him tenderly indoors while Joe and Ariel occupied themselves
with Mr Arp the good lady sprang to her feet as if she had been
stung regardlessly sending her workbasket and its contents scattering
over the floor and ran down the stairs three steps at a time

At the front door she met her husband entering for his dinner and she
leaped at him Had he seen What was it What had happened

Mr Louden rubbed his chinbeard indulging himself in a pause which
was like to prove fatal to his companion finally vouchsafing the
information that the doctors buggy was just turning the corner Eskew
Arp had suffered a stroke it was said and in Loudens opinion was
a mighty sick man His spouse replied in no uncertain terms that she
had seen quite that much for herself urging him to continue which he
did with a deliberation that caused her to recall their weddingday
with a gust of passionate selfreproach Presently he managed to
interrupt reminding her that her diningroom windows commanded as
comprehensive a view of the next house as did the front steps and
after a time her housewifely duty so far prevailed over her indignation
at the mans unwholesome stolidity that she followed him down the hall
to preside over the meal not however to partake largely of it
herself

Mr Louden had no information of Eugenes mishap nor had Mrs Louden
any suspicion that all was not well with the young man and hearing
him enter the front door she called to him that his dinner was
waiting Eugene however made no reply and went upstairs to his own
apartment without coming into the diningroom

A small crowd neighboring children servants and negroes had
gathered about Ariels gate and Mrs Louden watched the workingmen
disperse this assembly gather up their tools and depart then Mamie
came out of the house and bowing sadly to three old men who were
entering the gate as she left it stepped into her carriage and drove
away The newcomers Colonel Flitcroft Squire Buckalew and Peter
Bradbury glanced at the doctors buggy shook their heads at one
another and slowly went up to the porch where Joe met them Mrs
Louden uttered a sharp exclamation for the Colonel shook hands with
her stepson

Perhaps Flitcroft himself was surprised he had offered his hand almost
unconsciously and the greeting was embarrassed and perfunctory but
his two companions each in turn gravely followed his lead and Joes
set face flushed a little It was the first time in many years that
men of their kind in Canaan had offered him this salutation

He wouldnt let me send for you he told them He said he knew
youd be here soon without that And he led the way to Eskews
bedside

Joe and the doctor had undressed the old man and had put him into
nightgear of Roger Tabors taken from an antique chest it was soft
and yellow and much more like color than the face above it for the
white hair on the pillow was not whiter than that Yet there was a
strange youthfulness in the eyes of Eskew an eerie inexplicable
luminous LIVE look the thin cheeks seemed fuller than they had been
for years and though the heavier lines of age and sorrow could be
seen they appeared to have been half erased He lay not in sunshine
but in clear light the windows were open the curtains restrained for
he had asked them not to darken the room

The doctor was whispering in a doctors way to Ariel at the end of the
room opposite the bed when the three old fellows came in None of
them spoke immediately and though all three cleared their throats with
what they meant for casual cheerfulness to indicate that the situation
was not at all extraordinary or depressing it was to be seen that the
Colonels chin trembled under his mustache and his comrades showed
similar small and unwilling signs of emotion

Eskew spoke first Well boys he said and smiled

That seemed to make it more difficult for the others the three white
heads bent silently over the fourth upon the pillow and Ariel saw
waveringly for her eyes suddenly filled that the Colonel laid his
unsteady hand upon Eskews which was outside the coverlet

Itsits not said the old soldier gentlyits not onon both
sides is it Eskew

Mr Arp moved his hand slightly in answer It aint paralysis he
said They call it shock and exhaustion but its more than that
Its just my time Ive heard the call Weve all been slidin on
thin ice this long timeand its broke under me

Eskew Eskew remonstrated Peter Bradbury Youd oughtnt to talk
thataway You only kind of overdone a littleheat o the day too
and

Peter interrupted the sick man with feeble asperity did you ever
manage to fool me in your life

No Eskew

Well youre not doin it now

Two tears suddenly loosed themselves from Squire Buckalews eyelids
despite his hard endeavor to wink them away and he turned from the bed
too late to conceal what had happened There aint any call to feel
bad said Eskew It might have happened any timein the night
maybeat my houseand all alonebut heres Airie Tabor brought me to
her own home and takin care of me I couldnt ask any better way to
go could I

I dont know what well do stammered the Colonel if youyou talk
about goin away from us Eskew Wewe couldnt get along

Well sir Im almost kind of glad to think Mr Arp murmured
between short struggles for breath that it ll bequieteron
theNational House corner

A moment later he called the doctor faintly and asked for a
restorative There he said in a stronger voice and with a gleam of
satisfaction in the vindication of his belief that he was dying I
was almost gone then _I_ know He lay panting for a moment then
spoke the name of Joe Louden

Joe came quickly to the bedside

I want you to shake hands with the Colonel and Peter and Buckalew

We did answered the Colonel infinitely surprised and troubled We
shook hands outside before we came in


Do it again said Eskew I want to see you

And Joe making shift to smile was suddenly blinded so that he could
not see the wrinkled hands extended to him and was fain to grope for
them

God knows why we didnt all take his hand long ago said Eskew Arp
I didnt because I was stubborn I hated to admit that the argument
was against me I acknowledge it now before him and before youand I
want the word of it CARRIED

Its all right Mr Arp began Joe tremulously You mustnt

Hark to methe old mans voice lifted higher If youd ever
whimpered or give backtalk or broke out the wrong way it would of
been different But you never did Ive watched you and I know and
youve just gone your own way alone with the town against you because
you got a bad name as a boy and once wed given you that everything
you did or didnt do we had to give you a blacker one Now its time
some one stood by you Airie Tabor ll do that with all her soul and
body She told me once I thought a good deal of you She knew But I
want these three old friends of mine to do it too I was boys with
them and theyll do it I think Theyve even stood up fer you against
me sometimes but mostly fer the sake of the argument I reckon but
now they must do it when theres more to stand against than just my
talk They saw it all todaythe meanest thing I ever knew I could
of stood it all except that Before they could prevent him he had
struggled half upright in bed lifting a clinched fist at the town
beyond the windows But by God when they got so low down they tried
to kill your dog

He fell back choking in Joes arms and the physician bent over him
but Eskew was not gone and Ariel upon the other side of the room
could hear him whispering again for the restorative She brought it
and when he had taken it went quickly outofdoors to the side yard

She sat upon a workmans bench under the big trees hidden from the
street shrubbery and breathing deeply of the shaded air began to cry
quietly Through the windows came the quavering voice of the old man
lifted again insistent a little querulous but determined Responses
sounded intermittently from the Colonel from Peter and from
Buckalew and now and then a sorrowful yet almost humorous protest
from Joe and so she made out that the veteran swore his three comrades
to friendship with Joseph Louden to lend him their countenance in all
matters to stand by him in weal and woe to speak only good of him and
defend him in the town of Canaan Thus did Eskew Arp on the verge of
parting this life render justice


The gate clicked and Ariel saw Eugene approaching through the
shrubbery One of his hands was bandaged a thin strip of
courtplaster crossed his forehead from his left eyebrow to his hair
and his thin and agitated face showed several light scratches

I saw you come out he said Ive been waiting to speak to you

The doctor told us to let him have his way in whatever he might ask
Ariel wiped her eyes Im afraid that means

I didnt come to talk about Eskew Arp interrupted Eugene Im not
laboring under any anxiety about him You neednt be afraid hes too
sour to accept his conge so readily

Please lower your voice she said rising quickly and moving away
from him toward the house but as he followed insisting sharply that
he must speak with her she walked out of earshot of the windows and
stopping turned toward him

Very well she said Is it a message from Mamie

At this he faltered and hung fire

Have you been to see her she continued

I am anxious to know if her goodness and bravery caused her anyany
discomfort at home

You may set your mind at rest about that returned Eugene I was
there when the Judge came home to dinner I suppose you fear he may
have been rough with her for taking my stepbrother into the carriage
He was not On the contrary he spoke very quietly to her and went on
out toward the stables But I havent come to you to talk of Judge
Pike either

No said Ariel I dont care particularly to hear of him but of
Mamie

Nor of her either he broke out I want to talk of you

There was not mistaking him no possibility of misunderstanding the
real passion that shook him and her startled eyes betrayed her
comprehension

Yes I see you understand he cried bitterly Thats because youve
seen others the same way God help me he went on striking his
forehead with his open hand that young fool of a Bradbury told me you
refused him only yesterday He was proud of even rejection from you
And theres Norbertand half a dozen others perhaps already since
youve been here He flung out his arms in ludicrous savage despair
And here am I

Ah yes she cut him off it is of yourself that you want to speak
after allnot of me

Look here he vociferated are you going to marry that Joe Louden
I want to know whether you are or not He gave me thisand this
today He touched his bandaged hand and plastered forehead He ran
into meover mefor nothing when I was not on my guard struck me
downstamped on me

She turned upon him cheeks aflame eyes sparkling and dry

Mr Bantry she cried he did a good thing And now I want you to go
home I want you to go home and try if you can discover anything in
yourself that is worthy of Mamie and of what she showed herself to be
this morning If you can you will have found something that I could
like

She went rapidly toward the house and he was senseless enough to
follow babbling What do you think Im made of You trample on
meas he did I cant bear everything I tell you

But she lifted her hand with such imperious will that he stopped short
Then through the window of the sickroom came clearly the querulous
voice

I tell you it was I heard him speak just nowout there in the yard
that noaccount stepbrother of Joes What if he IS a hired hand on
the Tocsin Hed better give up his job and quit than do what hes
done to help make the town think hard of Joe And what IS he Why
hes worse than Cory When that Claudine Fear first came here Gene
Bantry was hangin around her himself Joe knew it and hed never tell
but I will I saw em buggyridin out near Beaver Beach and she
slapped his face fer him It ought to be TOLD

I didnt know that Joe knewthat Eugene stammered huskily It
wasit wasa long time ago

If you understood Joe she said in a low voice you would know that
before these men leave this house he will have their promise never to
tell

His eyes fell miserably then lifted again but in her clear and
unbearable gaze there shone such a flame of scorn as he could not
endure to look upon For the first time in his life he saw a true light
upon himself and though the vision was darkling the revelation was
complete

Heaven pity you she whispered

Eugene found himself alone and stumbled away his glance not lifted
He passed his own home without looking up and did not see his mother
beckoning frantically from a window She ran to the door and called
him He did not hear her but went on toward the Tocsin office with
his head still bent

NORBERT WAITS FOR JOE

There was meat for gossip a plenty in Canaan that afternoon and
evening there were rumors that ran from kitchen to parlor and rumors
that ran from parlor to kitchen speculations that detained housewives
in talk across front gates wonderings that held cooks in converse over
shadeless back fences in spite of the heat and canards that brought
Main Street clerks running to the shop doors to stare up and down the
sidewalks Out of the confusion of report the judicious were able by
evenfall to extract a fair history of this day of revolution There
remained no doubt that Joe Louden was in attendance at the deathbed of
Eskew Arp and somehow it came to be known that Colonel Flitcroft
Squire Buckalew and Peter Bradbury had shaken hands with Joe and
declared themselves his friends There were those particularly among
the relatives of the hoary trio who expressed the opinion that the
Colonel and his comrades were too old to be responsible and a
commission ought to sit on them nevertheless some echoes of Eskews
last argument to the conclave had sounded in the town and were not
wholly without effect

Everywhere there was a nipping curiosity to learn how Judge Pike had
taken the strange performance of his daughter and the eager were
much disappointed when it was truthfully reported that he had done and
said very little He had merely discharged both Sam Warden and Sams
wife from his service the mild manner of the dismissal almost
unnerving Mr Warden although he was fully prepared for birdshot and
the couple had found immediate employment in the service of Ariel Tabor

Those who humanly felt the Judges behavior to be a trifle flat and
unsensational were recompensed late in the afternoon when it became
known that Eugene Bantry had resigned his position on the Tocsin His
reason for severing his connection was dumfounding he had written a
formal letter to the Judge and repeated the gist of it to his
associates in the office and acquaintances upon the street He
declared that he no longer sympathized with the attitude of the Tocsin
toward his stepbrother and regretted that he had previously assisted
in emphasizing the papers hostility to Joe particularly in the matter
of the approaching murder trial This being the case he felt that his
effectiveness in the service of the paper had ceased and he must in
justice to the owner resign

Well Im damned was the simple comment of the elder Louden when his
stepson sought him out at the factory and repeated this statement to
him

So am I I think said Eugene wanly Goodbye Im going now to
see mother but Ill be gone before you come home

Gone where

Just away I dont know where Eugene answered from the door I
couldnt live here any longer I

Youve been drinking said Mr Louden inspired Youd better not
let Mamie Pike see you

Eugene laughed desolately I dont mean to I shall write to her
Goodbye he said and was gone before Mr Louden could restore enough
order out of the chaos in his mind to stop him

Thus Mrs Loudens long wait at the window was tragically rewarded and
she became an unhappy actor in Canaans drama of that day Other
ladies attended at other windows or near their front doors throughout
the afternoon the families of the three patriarchs awaiting their
return as the time drew on with something akin to frenzy Mrs
Flitcroft a lady of temper whose rheumatism confined her to a chair
had her grandson wheel her out upon the porch and as the dusk fell
and she finally saw her husband coming at a laggard pace leaning upon
his cane his chin sunk on his breast she frankly told Norbert that
although she had lived with that man more than fiftyseven years she
would never be able to understand him She repeated this with genuine
symptoms of hysteria when she discovered that the Colonel had not come
straight from the Tabor house but had stopped two hours at Peter
Bradburys to talk it over

One item of his recital while sufficiently startling to his wife had
a remarkable effect upon his grandson This was the information that
Ariel Tabors fortune no longer existed

Whats that cried Norbert starting to his feet What are you
talking about

Its true said the Colonel deliberately She told me so herself
Eskew had dropped off into a sort of dozemore like a stupor
perhapsand we all went into Rogers old studio except Louden and
the doctor and while we were there talkin one of Pikes clerks came
with a basket full of tin boxes and packages of papers and talked to
Miss Tabor at the door and went away Then old Peter blundered out and
asked her pointblank what it was and she said it was her estate
almost everything she had except the house Buckalew tryin to make
a joke said hed be willin to swap HIS house and lot for the basket
and she laughed and told him she thought hed be sorry that all there
was to speak of was a pile of distillery stock What repeated
Norbert incredulously

Yes It was the truth said the Colonel solemnly I saw it
myself blocks and blocks of stock in that distillery trust that went
up highern a kite last year Roger had put all of Jonass good
money

Not into that shouted Norbert uncontrollably excited

Yes he did I tell you I saw it

I tell you he didnt He owned Granger Gas worth more today than it
ever was Pike was Rogers attorneyinfact and bought it for him
before the old man died The check went through my hands You dont
think Id forget as big a check as that do you even if it was more
than a year ago Or how it was signed and who made out to It was
Martin Pike that got caught with distillery stock He speculated once
too often

No youre wrong persisted the Colonel I tell you I saw it
myself

Then youre blind returned his grandson disrespectfully youre
blind or elseor else He paused openmouthed a look of wonder
struggling its way to expression upon him gradually conquering every
knobby outpost of his countenance He struck his fat hands together
Wheres Joe Louden he asked sharply I want to see him Did you
leave him at Miss Tabors

Hes goin to sit up with Eskew What do you want of him

I should say you better ask that Mrs Flitcroft began shrilly
Its enough I guess for one of this family to go runnin after him
and shakin hands with him and Heaven knows what not NORBERT
FLITCROFT

But Norbert jumped from the porch ruthlessly crossed his grandmothers
geraniumbed and making off at as sharp a pace as his architecture
permitted within ten minutes opened Ariels gate

Sam Warden came forward to meet him

Dont ring please suh said Sam Dey sot me out heah to tell
inquirin friens dat po ole Mist Arp mighty low

I want to see Mr Louden returned Norbert I want to see him
immediately

I don reckon he kin come out yit Sam said in a low tone But I
kin go in an ast em

He stepped softly within leaving Norbert waiting and went to the door
of the sickroom The door was open the room brightly lighted as
Eskew had commanded when a little earlier he awoke

Joe and Ariel were alone with him leaning toward him with such white
anxiety that the colored man needed no warning to make him remain
silent in the hallway The veteran was speaking and his voice was very
weak seeming to come from a great distance

Its mighty funny but I feel like I used to when I was a little boy
I reckon Im kind of scaredafter all Airie Taborare youhere

Yes Mr Arp

I thoughtsobut II dont see very welllately
Iwantedtoknowto know

Yesto know She knelt close beside him

Its kind offoolish he whispered I justwanted to know if you
was still here Itdont seem so lonesome now that I know

She put her arm lightly about him and he smiled and was silent for a
time Then he struggled to rise upon his elbow and they lifted him a
little

Its hard to breathe gasped the old man Im pretty nearthe big
road Joe Louden

Yes

Youd have beenwillingwilling to change places with mejust
nowwhen Airie

Joe laid his hand on his and Eskew smiled again I thought so And
Joe

Yes

You alwaysalways had thethe best of that joke between us Do
youyou suppose they charge admissionup there His eyes were
lifted Do you suppose youve got toto show your good deeds to git
in The answering whisper was almost as faint as the old mans

No panted Eskew nobody knows But I hopeI do hopetheyll have
some free seats Its amighty poor showwellall haveif
theydont

He sighed peacefully his head grew heavier on Joes arm and the young
man set his hand gently upon the unseeing eyes Ariel did not rise
from where she knelt but looked up at him when a little later he
lifted his hand

Yes said Joe you can cry now

MR SHEEHAN SPEAKS

Joe helped to carry what was mortal of Eskew from Ariels house to its
final abidingplace With him in that task were Buckalew Bradbury
the Colonel and the grandsons of the two latter and Mrs Louden drew
in her skirts grimly as her stepson passed her in the mournful
procession through the hall Her eyes were red with weeping not for
Eskew but not so red as those of Mamie Pike who stood beside her

On the way to the cemetery Joe and Ariel were together in a carriage
with Buckalew and the minister who had read the service a dark
pleasanteyed young manand the Squire after being almost overcome
during the ceremony experienced a natural reaction talking cheerfully
throughout the long drive He recounted many anecdotes of Eskew
chuckling over most of them though filled with wonder by a coincidence
which he and Flitcroft had discovered the Colonel had recently been
made the custodian of his old friends will and it had been opened the
day before the funeral Eskew had left everything he possessedwith
the regret that it was so littleto Joe

But the queer thing about it said the Squire addressing himself to
Ariel was the date of it the seventeenth of June The Colonel and I
got to talkin it over out on his porch last night tryin to
reclect what was goin on about then and we figgered it out that it
was the Monday after you come back the very day he got so upset when
he saw you goin up to Loudens lawoffice with your roses

Joe looked quickly at Ariel She did not meet his glance but turning
instead to Ladew the clergyman began with a barely perceptible
blush to talk of something he had said in a sermon two weeks ago The
two fell into a thoughtful and amiable discussion during which there
stole into Joes heart a strange and unreasonable pain The young
minister had lived in Canaan only a few months and Joe had never seen
him until that morning but he liked the short honest talk he had
made liked his cadenceless voice and keen dark face and recalling
what he had heard Martin Pike vociferating in his brougham one Sunday
perceived that Ladew was the fellow who had got to go because his
sermons did not please the Judge Yet Ariel remembered for more than a
fortnight a passage from one of these sermons And as Joe looked at the
manly and intelligent face opposite him it did not seem strange that
she should

He resolutely turned his eyes to the open window and saw that they had
entered the cemetery were near the green knoll where Eskew was to lie
beside a brother who had died long ago He let the minister help Ariel
out going quickly forward himself with Buckalew and thenafter the
little while that the restoration of dust to dust mercifully needshe
returned to the carriage only to get his hat

Ariel and Ladew and the Squire were already seated and waiting
Arent you going to ride home with us she asked surprised

No he explained not looking at her I have to talk with Norbert
Flitcroft Im going back with him Goodbye

His excuse was the mere truth his conversation with Norbert in the
carriage which they managed to secure to themselves continuing
earnestly until Joe spoke to the driver and alighted at a corner near
Mr Farbachs Italian possessions Dont forget he said as he
closed the carriage door Ive got to have both ends of the string in
my hands

Forget Norbert looked at the cupola of the Pike Mansion rising
above the maples down the street It isnt likely Ill forget


When Joe entered the Louis Quinze room which some decorator drunk
with power had mingled into the brewers villa he found the owner and
Mr Sheehan with five other men engaged in a meritorious attempt to
tone down the apartment with smoke Two of the five others were
prosperous owners of saloons two were known to the public whose
notion of what it meant when it used the term was something of the
vaguest as politicians the fifth was Mr Farbachs closest friend
one who Joe had heard was to be the next chairman of the city
committee of the party They were seated about a table enveloped in
blue clouds and hushed to a grave and pertinent silence which
clarified immediately the circumstance that whatever debate had
preceded his arrival it was now settled

Their greeting of him however though exceedingly quiet indicated a
certain expectancy as he accepted the chair which had been left for
him at the head of the table He looked thinner and paler than usual
which is saying a great deal but presently finding that the fateful
hush which his entrance had broken was immediately resumed a twinkle
came into his eye one of his eyebrows went up and a corner of his
mouth went down

Well gentlemen he said

The smokers continued to smoke and to do nothing else the exception
being Mr Sheehan who though he spoke not exhibited tokens of
agitation and excitement which he curbed with difficulty shifting
about in his chair gnawing his cigar crossing and uncrossing his
knees rubbing and slapping his hands together clearing his throat
with violence his eyes fixed all the while as were those of his
companions upon Mr Farbach so that Joe was given to perceive that it
had been agreed that the brewer should be the spokesman Mr Farbach
was deliberate that was all which added to the effect of what he
finally did say

Choe he remarked placidly you are der next Mayor off Canaan

Why do you say that asked the young man sharply

Bickoss us here he answered interlocking the tips of his fingers
over his waistcoat that being as near folding his hands as lay within
his powerbickoss us here shall try to fix it so und so hef
ditcided

Joe took a deep breath Why do you want me

Dot replied the brewer iss someding I shall tell you He paused
to contemplate his cigar We want you bickoss you are der best man fer
dot positsion

Louie you mustnt make a mistake at the beginning Joe said
hurriedly I may not be the kind of man youre looking for If I
went in He hesitated stammering It seems an ungrateful thing to
say butbut there wouldnt be any slacknessI couldnt be bound to
anybody

Holt up your hosses Mr Farbach once in his life was so ready to
reply that he was able to interrupt Who hef you heert speak off
bounding Hef I speakt off favors Dit I say der shoult be slackness
in der city goferment Litsen to me Choe He renewed his
contemplation of his cigar then proceeded I hef been tinkin it
ofer now a couple years I hef mate up my mind If some peobles are
gombelt to keep der laws and oders are not dots a great atwantitch to
der oders Dot iss what iss ruining der gountry und der peobles iss

up at leven oglock und Sundays but der oders keep open If I own
der Mayor I make der same against dot oder brewery Now I am pooty
sick off dot ways off bitsness und fighting all times Also Mr
Farbach added with magnificent calmness my trade iss larchly
owitside off Canaan und it iss bedder dot here der laws shoult be
enforced der same fer all Litsen Choe all us here beliefs der same
way You are square Der whole tsaloon element knows dot und knows
dot all voult be treated der same Mit you it voult be fairness fer
each one Foolish peobles hef sait you are a lawtricker but we know

und all der granks vake up und we git a fool reformer fer Mayor und der
town goes to der dogs If I try to put in a man dot I own der oder
brewery iss goin to fight like hell but if I work fer you it will not
fight so hart

But the other people Joe objected those outside of what is called
the saloon elementdo you understand how many of them will be against
me

It iss der tsaloon element Mr Farbach returned peacefully dot
does der fightin

And you have considered my standing with that part of Canaan which
considers itself the most respectable section He rose to his feet
standing straight and quiet facing the table upon which it chanced
there lay a copy of the Tocsin

Und yet observed Mr Farbach with mildness we got some pooty
risbecdable men right here

Except me broke in Mr Sheehan grimly you have

Have you thought of this Joe leaned forward and touched the paper
upon the table

We hef replied Mr Farbach All of us You shall beat it

There was a strong chorus of confirmation from the others and Joes
eyes flashed

Have you considered he continued rapidly while a warm color began
to conquer his pallorhave you considered the powerful influence
which will be against me and more against me now I should tell you
than ever before That influence I mean which is striving so hard to
discredit me that lynchlaw has been hinted for poor Fear if I should
clear him Have you thought of that Have you thought

Have we thought o Martin Pike exclaimed Mr Sheehan springing to
his feet face aflame and beard bristling Ay weve thought o
Martin Pike and our thinkin of him is where he begins to git whats
comin to him What dye stand there pickin straws fer Whats the
matter with ye he demanded angrily his violence tenfold increased
by the long repression he had put upon himself during the brewers
deliberate utterances If Louie Farbach and his crowd says theyre fer
ye I guess yeve got a chanst havent ye

Wait said Joe I think you underestimate Pikes influence

Underestimate the devil shouted Mr Sheehan uncontrollably excited
You talk about influence Hes been the worst influence this towns
ever hadand his tracks covered up in the dark wherever he set his
ugly foot down These men know it and you know some but not the
worst of it because none of ye live as deep down in it as I do Ye
want to make a clean town of it ye want to make a little heaven of the
Beach

And in the eyes of Judge Pike Joe cut him off and of all who take
their opinions from him I REPRESENT Beaver Beach

Mike Sheehan gave a wild shout Whooroo Its come I knowed it
would The day I couldnt hold my tongue though I passed my word I
would when the coward showed the deed he didnt dare to git recorded
Waugh He shouted again with bitter laughter Ye do In the eyes
o them as follow Martin Pike ye stand fer the Beach and all its
wickedness do ye Whooroo Its come Yere an offence in the eyes
o Martin Pike and all his kind because ye stand fer the Beach are ye

You know it Joe answered sharply If they could wipe the Beach
off the map and me with it

Martin Pike would shouted Mr Sheehan while the others
openmouthed stared at him Martin Pike would

I dont need to tell you that said Joe

Mr Sheehans big fist rose high over the table and descended crashing
upon it Its a damn lie he roared Martin Pike owns Beaver
Beach

JOE WALKS ACROSS THE COURTHOUSE YARD

From within the glossy old walnut bar that ran from wall to wall the
eyes of the lawyers and reporters wandered often to Ariel as she sat in
the packed courtroom watching Loudens fight for the life and liberty
of Happy Fear She had always three escorts and though she did not
miss a session and the same three never failed to attend her no
whisper of scandal arose But not upon them did the glances of the
members of the bar and the journalists with tender frequency linger
nor were the younger members of these two professions all who gazed
that way Joe had fought out the selection of the jury with the
prosecutor at great length and with infinite pains it was not a young
jury and IT stared at her The Court wore a gray beard with which a
flock of sparrows might have villaged a grove and yet in spite of the
vital necessity for watchfulness over this fighting case IT once
needed to be stirred from a trancelike gaze in Miss Tabors direction
and aroused to the realization that It was there to Sit and not to
dream

The August air was warm outside the windows inviting to the open
country to swimminhole to orchard reveries or shaded pool wherein
to drop a meditative line you would have thought no one could
willingly coop himself in this hot room for three hours twice a day
while lawyers wrangled often unintelligibly over the life of a dingy
little creature like Happy Fear yet the struggle to swelter there was
almost like a riot and the bailiffs were busy men

It was a fighting case throughout fought to a finish on each tiny
point as it came up dragging in the mere matter of time
interminably yet the people of Canaan not only those who succeeded in
penetrating to the courtroom but the others who hung about the
corridors or outside the building and the great mass of stayathomes
who read the story in the Tocsin found each moment of it enthralling
enough The States attorney fearful of losing so notorious a case
and not underestimating his opponent had modestly summoned others to
his aid and the attorney for the defence singlehanded faced an
array of legal talent such as seldom indeed had hollered at this bar
faced it goodnaturedly an eyebrow crooked up and his head on one
side most of the time yet faced it indomitably He had a certain
careless and disarming smile when he lost a point which carried off
the defeat as of only humorous account and not at all part of the
serious business in hand and in his treatment of witnesses he was
plausible kindly knowing that in this case he had no intending
perjurer to entrap brought into play the rare and delicate art of
which he was a master employing in his questions subtle suggestions
and shadings of tone and manner and avoiding words of debatable and
dangerous meaningsa fine craft often attempted by blunderers to
their own undoing but which practised by Joseph Louden made
inarticulate witnesses articulate to the precise effects which he
desired This he accomplished as much by the help of the continuous
fire of objections from the other side as in spite of them He was
infinitely careful asking never an illadvised question for the other
side to use to his hurt and though exhibiting only a pleasant
easiness of manner was electrically alert

A hundred things had shown Ariel that the feeling of the place
influenced by public sentiment without was subtly and profoundly
hostile to Joe and his client she read this in the spectators in the
jury even in the Judge but it seemed to her that day by day the
inimical spirit gradually failed inside the railing and also in those
spectators who like herself were enabled by special favor to be
present throughout the trial and that now and then a kindlier
sentiment began to be manifested She was unaware how strongly she
contributed to effect this herself not only through the glow of
visible sympathy which radiated from her but by a particular action
Claudine was called by the State and told as much of her story as the
law permitted her to tell interlarding her replies with fervent
protestations too quick to be prevented that she never meant to
bring no trouble to Mr Fear and that she did hate to have genlemen
starting things on her account When the defence took this perturbed
witness her interpolations became less frequent and she described
straightforwardly how she had found the pistol on the floor near the
prostrate figure of Cory and hidden it in her own dress The
attorneys for the State listened with a somewhat cynical amusement to
this portion of her testimony believing it of no account
uncorroborated and that if necessary the State could impeach the
witness on the ground that it had been indispensable to produce her
She came down weeping from the stand and the next witness not being
immediately called the eyes of the jurymen naturally followed her as
she passed to her seat and they saw Ariel Tabor bow gravely to her
across the railing Now a thousand things not set forth by
legislatures lawmen and judges affect a jury and the slight
salutation caused the members of this one to glance at one another for
it seemed to imply that the exquisite lady in white not only knew
Claudine but knew that she had spoken the truth It was after this
that a feeling favorable to the defence now and then noticeably
manifested itself in the courtroom Still when the evidence for the
State was all in the life of Happy Fear seemed to rest in a balance
precarious indeed and the little man swallowing pitifully looked at
his attorney with the eyes of a sick dog

Then Joe gave the prosecutors an illuminating and stunning surprise
and having offered in evidence the revolver found upon Claudine
produced as his first witness a pawnbroker of Denver who identified
the weapon as one he had sold to Cory whom he had known very well
The second witness also a stranger had been even more intimately
acquainted with the dead man and there began to be an uneasy
comprehension of what Joe had accomplished during that prolonged
absence of his which had so nearly cost the life of the little mongrel
who was at present most blissful Respectability a lively
convalescent in Ariels back yard The second witness also identified
the revolver testifying that he had borrowed it from Cory in St Louis
to settle a question of marksmanship and that on his returning it to
the owner the latter then working his way eastward had confided to
him his intention of stopping in Canaan for the purpose of exercising
its melancholy functions upon a man who had once done him good in
that city

By the time the witness had reached this point the Prosecutor and his
assistants were on their feet excitedly shouting objections which
were promptly overruled Taken unawares they fought for time thunder
was loosed forensic bellowings everybody lost his temperexcept Joe
and the examination of the witness proceeded Cory with that singular
inspiration to confide in some one which is the characteristic and the
undoing of his kind had outlined his plan of operations to the witness
with perfect clarity He would first attempt so he had declared to
incite an attack upon himself by playing upon the jealousy of his
victim having already made a tentative effort in that direction
Failing in this he would fall back upon one of a dozen schemes for he
was ready in such matters he bragged the most likely of which would
be to play the peacemaker he would talk of his good intentions toward
his enemy speaking publicly of him in friendly and gentle ways then
getting at him secretly destroy him in such a fashion as to leave open
for himself the kind gate of selfdefence In brief here was the
whole tally of what had actually occurred with the exception of the
last account in the sequence which had proved that demise for which
Cory had not arranged and it fell from the lips of a witness whom the
prosecution had no means of impeaching When he left the stand
unshaken and undiscredited after a frantic crossexamination Joe
turning to resume his seat let his hand fall lightly for a second upon
his clients shoulder

That was the occasion of a demonstration which indicated a sentiment
favorable to the defence on the part of at least three of the
spectators and it was in the nature of such a hammering of canes upon
the bare wooden floor as effectually stopped all other proceedings
instantly The indignant Judge fixed the Colonel Peter Bradbury and
Squire Buckalew with his glittering eye yet the hammering continued
unabated and the offenders surely would have been conducted forth in
ignominy had not gallantry prevailed even in that formal place The
Judge reluctantly realizing that some latitude must be allowed to
these aged enthusiasts since they somehow seemed to belong to Miss
Tabor made his remarks general with the timeworn threat to clear the
room whereupon the loyal survivors of Eskew relapsed into unabashed
silence

It was now as Joe had said a clearenough case Only the case itself
however was clear for as he and his friends feared the verdict
might possibly be neither in accordance with the law the facts nor
the convictions of the jury Eugenes defection had not altered the
tone of the Tocsin

All day long a crowd of men and boys hung about the corridors of the
Courthouse about the Square and the neighboring streets and from
these rose sombre murmurs more and more ominous The public sentiment
of a community like Canaan can make itself felt inside a courtroom
and it was strongly exerted against Happy Fear The Tocsin had always
been a powerful agent Judge Pike had increased its strength with a
staff which was thoroughly efficient alert and always able to strike
centre with the papers readers and in town and country it had
absorbed the circulation of the other local journals which resisted
feebly at times but in the matter of the Cory murder had not dared to
do anything except follow the Tocsins lead The Tocsin having lit
the fire fed itfed it saltpetre and sulphurfor now Martin Pike was
fighting hard

The farmers and people of the less urban parts of the country were
accustomed to found their opinions upon the Tocsin They regarded it
as the single immutable rock of journalistic righteousness and wisdom
in the world Consequently stirred by the outbursts of the paper
they came into Canaan in great numbers and though the pressure from
the town itself was so strong that only a few of them managed to crowd
into the courtroom the others joined their voices to those sombre
murmurs outdoors which increased in loudness as the trial went on

The Tocsin however was not having everything its own way the volume
of outcry against Happy Fear and his lawyer had diminished it was
noticed in very respectable quarters The information imparted by
Mike Sheehan to the politicians at Mr Farbachs had been slowly
seeping through the various social strata of the town and though at
first incredulously rejected it began to find acceptance Upper Main
Street cooling appreciably in its acceptance of the Tocsin as the law
and the prophets There were even a few who dared to wonder in their
hearts if there had not been a mistake about Joe Louden and although
Mrs Flitcroft weakened not the relatives of Squire Buckalew and of
Peter Bradbury began to hold up their heads a little after having made
home horrible for those gentlemen and reproached them with their
conversion as the last word of senile shame In addition the
Colonels grandson and Mr Bradburys grandson had both mystifyingly
lent countenance to Joe consorting with him openly the former for his
own purposesthe latter because he had cunningly discovered that it
was a way to Miss Tabors regard which since her gentle rejection of
him he had grown to believe good youth might be the pleasantest
thing that could ever come to him In short the question had begun to
thrive Was it possible that Eskew Arp had not been insane after all

The best of those who gathered ominously about the Courthouse and its
purlieus were the young farmers and fieldhands artisans and clerks
one of the latter being a pimply faced young man lately from the
doctors hands who limped and would limp for the rest of his life
he who of all men held the memory of Eskew Arp in least respect and
was burningly desirous to revenge himself upon the living

The worst were of that mystifying embryonic semirowdy type the
American voyou in the production of which Canaan and her sister towns
everywhere over the country are prolific the young man youth boy
perhaps creature of nameless age whose clothes are like those of a
brakeman out of work but who is not a brakeman in or out of work
wearing the black soft hat tilted forward to shelteras a counter
does the contempt of a clerkthat expression which the face does not
dare wear quite in the open asserting the possession of supreme
capacity in wit strength dexterity and amours the dirty
handkerchief under the collar the short black coat always
doublebreasted the eyelids sooty one cheek always bulged the
forehead speckled the lips cracked horrible teeth and the
affectation of possessing secret information upon all matters of the
universe above all the instinct of finding the shortest way to any
scene of official interest to the policeman fireman or ambulance
surgeona singular being not professionally criminal tough
histrionically rather than really full of its own argot of brag
hysterical when crossed timid through great ignorance and therefore
dangerous It furnishes not the leaders but the mass of mobs and it
springs up at times of crisis from Heaven knows where You might have
driven through all the streets of Canaan a week before the trial and
have seen four or five such fellows but from the day of its beginning
the Square was full of them dingy shuttlecocks batted up into view by
the Tocsin

They kept the air whirring with their noise The news of that sitting
which had caused the Squire Flitcroft and Peter Bradbury to risk the
Courts displeasure was greeted outside with loud and vehement
disfavor and when at noon the jurymen were marshalled out to cross
the yard to the National House for dinner a large crowd followed and
surrounded them until they reached the doors of the hotel Dont let
Lawyer Louden bamboozle you Hang him Tar and feathers fer ye ef
ye dont hang him These were the mildest threats and Joe Louden
watching from an upper window of the Courthouse observed with a
troubled eye how certain of the jury shrank from the pressure of the
throng how the cheeks of others showed sudden pallor Sometimes
public sentiment has done evil things to those who have not shared
it and Joe knew how rare a thing is a jury which dares to stand square
against a town like Canaan aroused

The end of that afternoons session saw another point marked for the
defence Joe had put the defendant on the stand and the little man had
proved an excellent witness During his life he had been many
thingsmany things disreputable high standards were not brightly
illumined for him in the beginning of the nightmarch which his life
had been He had been a tramp afterward a petty gambler but his
great motive had finally come to be the intention to do what Joe told
him to do that and to keep Claudine as straight as he could In a
measure these were the two things that had brought him to the pass in
which he now stood his loyalty to Joe and his resentment of whatever
tampered with Claudines straightness He was submissive to the
consequences he was still loyal And now Joe asked him to tell just
what happened and Happy obeyed with crystal clearness Throughout
the long tricky crossexamination he continued to tell just what
happened with a plaintive truthfulness not to be imitated and
throughout it Joe guarded him from pitfalls for lawyers in their
search after truth are compelled by the exigencies of their profession
to make pitfalls even for the honest and gave him by various
devices time to remember though not to think and made the words
come right in his mouth So that before the sitting was over a
disquieting rumor ran through the waiting crowd in the corridors
across the Square and over the town that the case was surely going
Loudens way This was also the opinion of a lookeron in Canaana
ferretfaced counsellor of corporations who called to consultation
with the eminent Buckalew nephew of the Squire had afterward spent
an hour in his company at the trial Its going that young fellow
Loudens way said the stranger You say hes a shyster but

Well admitted Buckalew with some reluctance I dont mean that
exactly Ive got an old uncle who seems lately to think hes a great
man

Ill take your uncles word for it returned the other smiling I
think hell go pretty far

They had come to the flight of steps which descended to the yardand
the visitor looking down upon the angry crowd added If they dont
kill him

Joe himself was anxious concerning no such matter He shook hands with
Happy at the end of the sitting bidding him be of good cheer and
when the little man had marched away under a strong guard began to
gather and sort his papers at a desk inside the bar This took him
perhaps five minutes and when he had finished there were only three
people left in the room a clerk a negro janitor with a broom and the
darky friend who always hopefully accompanies a colored man holding
high public office These two approvingly greeted the young lawyer
the janitor handing him a note from Norbert Flitcroft and the friend
mechanically borrowing a quarter from him as he opened the envelope

Ill be roun yo way to git a box o SEgahs laughed the friend
soon ez de campaign open up good Dey all goin vote yo way down on
the levee bank but dey sho expecks to git to smoke a little fo
leckshunday We knows whos OW frien

Norberts missive was lengthy and absorbing Joe went on his way
perusing it with profound attention but as he descended the stairway
to the floor below a loud burst of angry shouting outside the
building caused him to hasten toward the big front doors which faced
Main Street The doors opened upon an imposing vestibule from which a
handsome flight of stone steps protected by a marble balustrade led
to the ground

Standing at the top of these steps and leaning over the balustrade he
had a clear view of half the yard No one was near him everybody was
running in the opposite direction toward that corner of the yard
occupied by the jail the crowd centring upon an agitated whirlpool of
men which moved slowly toward a door in the high wall that enclosed the
building and Joe saw that Happy Fears guards conducting the prisoner
back to his cell were being jostled and rushed The distance they had
made was short but as they reached the door the pressure upon them
increased dangerously Clubs rose in the air hats flew the whirlpool
heaved tumultuously and the steel door clanged

Happy Fear was safe inside but the jostlers were outsidebaffled
ugly and stirred with the passion that changes a crowd into a mob

Then some of them caught sight of Joe as he stood alone at the top of
the steps and a great shout of rage and exultation arose

For a moment or two he did not see his danger At the clang of the
door his eyes caught by the gleam of a wide white hat had turned
toward the street and he was somewhat fixedly watching Mr Ladew
extricate Ariel and her aged and indignant escorts from an overflow
of the crowd in which they had been caught But a voice warned him
the wild piping of a newsboy who had climbed into a tree near by

JOE LOUDEN he screamed LOOK OUT

With a muffled roar the crowd surged back from the jail and turned
toward the steps Tar and feather him Take him over to the river
and throw him in Drown him Hang him

Then a thing happened which was dramatic enough in its inception but
almost ludicrous in its effect Joe walked quietly down the steps and
toward the advancing mob with his head cocked to one side one eyebrow
lifted and one corner of his mouth drawn down in a faintly distorted
smile

He went straight toward the yelling forerunners with only a small
bundle of papers in his hands and thenwhile the nonpartisan
spectators held their breath expecting the shock of contactstraight
on through them

A number of the bulgecheeked formed the scattering van of these
forerunners charging with hoarse and cruel shrieks of triumph The
first apparently about to tear Joseph Louden to pieces changed
countenance at armslength swerved violently and with the loud cry
HEAD HIM OFF dashed on up the stone steps The man next behind him
followed his lead with the same shout strategy and haste then the
others of this advance attack finding themselves confronting the quiet
man who kept his even pace and showed no intention of turning aside
for them turned suddenly aside for HIM and taking the cue from the
first pursued their way bellowing HEAD HIM OFF HEAD HIM OFF
until there were a dozen and more rowdyish men and youths upon the
steps their eyes blazing with fury menacing Loudens back with
frightful gestures across the marble balustrade as they hysterically
bleated the chorus HEAD HIM OFF

Whether or not Joe could have walked through the entire mob as he had
walked through these is a matter for speculation it was believed in
Canaan that he could Already a gust of mirth began to sweep over the
sterner spirits as they paused to marvel no less at the disconcerting
advance of the lawyer than at the spectacle presented by the intrepid
daredevils upon the steps a kind of lane actually opening before the
young man as he walked steadily on And when Mr Sheehan leading half
a dozen huge men from the Farbach brewery unceremoniously shouldered a
way through the mob to Joes side reaching him where the press was
thickest it is a question if the services of his detachment were
needed

The laughter increased It became voluminous Homeric salvos shook the
air And never one of the fireeaters upon the steps lived long enough
to live down the hateful cry of that day HEAD HIM OFF which was to
become a catchword on the streets a taunt more stinging than any
devised by deliberate invention an insult bitterer than the ancestral
doubt a fightingword and the great historical joke of Canaan never
omitted in afterdays when the tale was told how Joe Louden took that
short walk across the Courthouse yard which made him Mayor of Canaan

MARTIN PIKE KEEPS AN ENGAGEMENT

An hour later Martin Pike looking forth from the Mansion saw a man
open the gate and passing between the unemotional deer rapidly
approach the house He was a thin young fellow very well dressed in
dark gray his hair prematurely somewhat silvered his face prematurely
somewhat lined and his hat covered a scar such as might have been
caused by a blow from a blunt instrument in the nature of a poker

He did not reach the door nor was there necessity for him to ring
for before he had set foot on the lowest step the Judge had hastened
to meet him Not however with any fulsomely hospitable intent his
hand and arm were raised to execute one of his Olympian gestures of
the kind which had obliterated the young man upon a certain bygone
morning

Louden looked up calmly at the big figure towering above him

It wont do Judge he said that was all but there was a
significance in his manner and a certainty in his voice which caused
the uplifted hand to drop limply while the look of apprehension which
of late had grown more and more to be Martin Pikes habitual expression
deepened into something close upon mortal anxiety

Have you any business to set foot upon my property he demanded

Yes answered Joe Thats why I came

What business have you got with me

Enough to satisfy you I think But theres one thing I dont want to
doJoe glanced at the open doorand that is to talk about it
herefor your own sake and because I think Miss Tabor should be
present I called to ask you to come to her house at eight oclock
tonight

You did Martin Pike spoke angrily but not in the bullbass of yore
and he kept his voice down glancing about him nervously as though he
feared that his wife or Mamie might hear My accounts with her estate
are closed he said harshly If she wants anything let her come
here

Joe shook his head No You must be there at eight oclock

The Judges choler got the better of his uneasiness Youre a pretty
one to come ordering me around he broke out You slanderer do you
suppose I havent heard how youre going about traducing me
undermining my character in this community spreading scandals that I
am the real owner of Beaver Beach

It can easily be proved Judge Joe interrupted quietly though
youre wrong I havent been telling people I havent needed toeven
if Id wished Once a thing like that gets out you cant stop
itever That isnt all to my knowledge you own other property worse
than the Beach I know that you own half of the worst dens in the town
profitable investments too You bought them very gradually and
craftily only showing the deeds to those in chargeas you did to Mike
Sheehan and not recording them Sheehans betrayal of you gave me the
key I know most of the poor creatures who are your tenants too you
see and that gave me an advantage because they have some confidence in
me My investigations have been almost as quiet and careful as your
purchases

You damned blackmailer The Judge bent upon him a fierce inquiring
scrutiny in which oddly enough there was a kind of haggard
hopefulness And out of such stories he sneered you are going to
try to make political capital against the Tocsin are you

No said Joe It was necessary in the interests of my client for me
to know pretty thoroughly just what property you own and I think I do
These pieces Ive mentioned are about all you have not mortgaged You
couldnt do that without exposure and youve kept a controlling
interest in the Tocsin clear toofor the sake of its influence I
suppose Now do you want to hear any more or will you agree to meet
me at Miss Tabors this evening

Whatever the look of hopefulness had signified it fled from Pikes
face during this speech but he asked with some show of contempt Do
you think it likely

Very well said Joe if you want me to speak here And he came a
little closer to him You bought a big block of Granger Gas for Roger
Tabor he began in a low voice Before his death you sold
everything he had except the old house put it all into cash for him
and bought that stock you signed the check as his attorneyinfact
and it came back to you through the Washington National where Norbert
Flitcroft handled it He has a good memory and when he told me what
he knew I had him to do some tracing did a little myself also
Judge Pike I must tell you that you stand in danger of the law You
were the custodian of that stock for Roger Tabor it was transferred in
blank though I think you meant to be legal at that time and that
was merely for convenience in case Roger had wished you to sell it for
him But just after his death you found yourself saddled with
distillery stock which was going bad on your hands Other
speculations of yours were failing at the same time you had to have
moneyyou filed your report as administrator crediting Miss Tabor
with your own stock which you knew was going to the wall and
transferred hers to yourself Then you sold it because you needed
ready money You used her fortune to save yourselfbut you were
horribly afraid No matter how rotten your transactions had been you
had always kept inside the law and now that you had gone outside of
it you were frightened You didnt dare come flat out to Miss Tabor
with the statement that her fortune had gone it had been in your
charge all the time and things might look ugly So you put it off
perhaps from day to day You didnt dare tell her until you were
forced to and to avoid the confession you sent her the income which
was rightfully hers That was your great weakness

Joe had spoken with great rapidity though keeping his voice low and
he lowered it again as he continued Judge Pike what chance have
you to be believed in court when you swear that you sent her twenty
thousand dollars out of the goodness of your heart Do you think SHE
believed you It was the very proof to her that you had robbed her
For she knew you Do you want to hear more now Do you think this is
a good place for it Do you wish me to go over the details of each
step I have taken against you to land you at the bar where this poor
fellow your paper is hounding stands today

The Judge essayed to answer and could not He lifted his hand
uncertainly and dropped it while a thick dew gathered on his temples
Inarticulate sounds came from between his teeth

You will come said Joe

Martin Pike bent his head dazedly and at that the other turned quickly
from him and went away without looking back


Ariel was in the studio half an hour later when Joe was announced by
the smiling Mr Warden Ladew was with her though upon the point of
taking his leave and Joe marked with a sinking heart that the young
ministers cheeks were flushed and his eyes very bright

It was a magnificent thing you did Mr Louden he said offering his
hand heartily I saw it and it was even finer in one way than it was
plucky It somehow straightened things out with such perfect good
nature it made those people feel that what they were doing was
ridiculous

So it was said Joe

Few under the circumstances could have acted as if they thought so
And I hope youll let me call upon you Mr Louden

I hope you will he answered and then when the minister had
departed stood looking after him with sad eyes in which there dwelt
obscure meditations Ladews word of farewell had covered a deep look
at Ariel which was not to be mistaken by Joseph Louden for anything
other than what it was the clergymans secret was an open one and Joe
saw that he was as frank and manly in love as in all other things
Hes a good fellow he said at last sighing A good man

Ariel agreed And he said more to me than he did to you

Yes I think it probable Joe smiled sorrowfully

About YOU I mean He had time to fear that her look admitted
confusion before she proceeded He said he had never seen anything so
fine as your coming down those steps Ah he was right But it was
harder for me to watch you I think than for you to do it Joe I was
so horribly afraidand the crowd between usif we could have got near
youbut we couldntwe

She faltered and pressed her hand close upon her eyes

We asked Joe slowly You mean you and Mr Ladew

Yes he was there but I meanher voice ran into a little laugh with
a beatific quaver in itI mean Colonel Flitcroft and Mr Bradbury and
Mr Buckalew toowe were hemmed in together when Mr Ladew found
usand oh Joe when that cowardly rush started toward you those
threeIve heard wonderful things in Paris and Naples cabmen
quarrelling and disappointed beggarsbut never anything like them
today

You mean they were profane

Oh magnificentlyand with such inventiveness All three begged my
pardon afterwards I didnt grant itI blessed them

Did they beg Mr Ladews pardon

Ah Joe she reproached him He isnt a prig And hes had to
fight some things that you of all men ought to understand Hes only
been here a few months but he told me that Judge Pike has been against
him from the start It seems that Mr Ladew is too liberal in his
views And he told me that if it were not for Judge Pikes losing
influence in the church on account of the Beaver Beach story the Judge
would probably have been able to force him to resign but now he will
stay

He wishes to stay doesnt he

Very much I think And Joe she continued thoughtfully I want
you to do something for me I want you to go to church with me next
Sunday

To hear Mr Ladew

Yes I wouldnt ask except for that

Very well he consented with averted eyes Ill go

Her face was radiant with the smile she gave him It will make me
very happy she said

He bent his head and fumbled over some papers he had taken from his
pocket Will you listen to these memoranda We have a great deal to
go over before eight oclock


Judge Pike stood for a long while where Joe had left him staring out
at the street apparently Really he saw nothing Undoubtedly an image
of blurring foliage castiron cement and turf with sunshine smeared
over all flickered upon the retinas of his eyes but the brain did not
accept the picture from the optic nerve Martin Pike was busy with
other visions Joe Louden had followed him back to his hidden deeds
and had read them aloud to him as Gabriel would read them on
Judgmentday Perhaps THIS was the Judgmentday

Pike had taken charge of Roger Tabors affairs because the commissions
as agent were not too inconsiderable to be neglected To make the task
simpler he had sold as time went on the various properties of the
estate gradually converting all of them into cash Then the
opportunity offering he bought a stock which paid excellent dividends
had it transferred in blank because if it should prove to Rogers
advantage to sell it his agent could do so without any formal delays
between Paris and Canaan At least that is what the Judge had told
himself at the time though it may be that some lurking whisperer in
his soul had hinted that it might be well to preserve the great amount
of cash in hand and Rogers stock was practically that Then came the
evil days Laboriously he had built up a name for conservatism which
most of the town accepted but secretly he had always been a gambler
Wall Street was his goal to adventure there as one of the great
singleeyed Cyclopean maneaters his fond ambition and he had
conceived the distillery trust as a means to attain it but the
structure tumbled about his ears other edifices of his crumbled at the
same time he found himself beset his solvency endangered and there
was the Tabor stock quite as good as gold Roger had just died and it
was enough to save himSave That was a strange way to be
remembering it today when Fate grinned at him out of a dreadful mask
contorted like the face of Norbert Flitcroft

Martin Pike knew himself for a fool What chance had he though he
destroyed the check a thousand times over to escape the records by
which the coil of modern trade duplicates and quadruplicates each slip
of scribbled paper What chance had he against the memories of men
Would the man of whom he had bought forget that the check was signed
by Rogers agent Had the bankclerk forgotten Thrice fool Martin
Pike to dream that in a town like Canaan Norbert or any of his kind
could touch an order for so great a sum and forget it But Martin Pike
had not dreamed that had dreamed nothing When failure confronted him
his mind refused to consider anything but his vital need at the time
and he had supplied that need And now he grew busy with the future
he saw first the civil suit for restitution pressed with the ferocity
and cunning of one who intended to satisfy a grudge of years then
perhaps a criminal prosecution But he would fight it Did they
think that such a man was to be overthrown by a breath of air By a
girl a bankclerk and a shyster lawyer They would find their case
difficult to prove in court He did not believe they COULD prove it
They would be discredited for the attempt upon him and he would win
clear these Beaver Beach scandals would die of inertia presently
there would be a lucky trick in wheat and Martin Pike would be Martin
Pike once more reinstated dictator of church politics business all
those things which were the breath of his life restored He would show
this pitiful pack what manner of man they hounded Norbert
Flitcroft

The Judge put his big hand up to his eyes and rubbed them Curious
mechanisms the eyes That deer in line with the visionnot a zebra
A zebra after all these years And yet  curious indeed the eyes
 a zebra Who ever heard of a deer with stripes The big hand
rose from the eyes and ran through the hair which he had always worn
rather long It would seem strange to have it cut very short Did
they use clippers perhaps 

He started suddenly and realized that his nextdoor neighbor had passed
along the sidewalk with head averted pretending not to see him A few
weeks ago the man would not have missed the chance of looking in to
bowwith proper deference too Did he know He could not know THIS
It must be the Beaver Beach scandal It must be It could not be
THISnot yet But it MIGHT be How many knew Louden Norbert
Arielwho else And again the deer took on the strange zebra look

The Judge walked slowly down to the gate spoke to the man he had
employed in Sam Wardens place a Scotchman who had begun to refresh
the lawn with a garden hose bowed affably in response to the
salutation of the elder Louden who was passing bound homeward from
the factory and returned to the house with thoughtful steps In the
hall he encountered his wife stopped to speak with her upon various
household matters then entered the library which was his workroom
He locked the door tried it and shook the handle After satisfying
himself of its security he pulled down the windowshades carefully
and lighting a gas droplamp upon his desk began to fumble with
various documents which he took from a small safe near by But his
hands were not steady he dropped the papers scattering them over the
floor and had great difficulty in picking them up He perspired
heavily whatever he touched became damp and he continually mopped his
forehead with his sleeve After a time he gave up the attempt to sort
the packets of papers sank into a chair despairingly leaving most of
them in disorder A light tap sounded on the door

Martin its suppertime

With a great effort he made shift to answer Yes I know You and
Mamie go ahead Im too busy tonight I dont want anything

A moment before he had been a pitiful figure face distraught hands
incoherent the whole body incoordinate but if eyes might have rested
upon him as he answered his wife they would have seen a strange thing
he sat apparently steady and collected his expression cool his body
quiet poised exactly to the quality of his reply for the same strange
reason that a young girl smiles archly and coquettes to a telephone

But Martin you oughtnt to work so hard Youll break down

No fear of that he replied cheerfully You can leave something on
the sideboard for me

After another fluttering remonstrance she went away and the room was
silent again His arms rested upon the desk and his head slowly sank
between his elbows When he lifted it again the clock on the
mantelpiece had tinkled once It was halfpast seven He took a
sheet of notepaper from a box before him and began to write but when
he had finished the words My dear wife and Mamie his fingers shook
so violently that he could go no further He placed his left hand over
the back of his right to steady it but found the device unavailing
the pen left mere zigzags on the page and he dropped it

He opened a lower drawer of the desk and took out of it a pistol rose
went to the door tried it once more and again was satisfied of his
seclusion Then he took the weapon in both hands the handle against
his fingers one thumb against the trigger and shaking with nausea
lifted it to the level of his eyes His will betrayed him he could
not contract his thumb upon the trigger and with a convulsive shiver
he dropped the revolver upon the desk

He locked the door of the room behind him crept down the stairs and
out of the frontdoor He walked shamblingly when he reached the
street keeping close to the fences as he went on now and then
touching the pickets with his hands like a feeble old man

He had always been prompt it was one of the things of which he had
been proud in all his life he had never failed to keep a business
engagement precisely upon the appointed time and the Courthouse bell
clanged eight when Sam Warden opened the door for his old employer
tonight

The two young people looked up gravely from the scriptladen table
before them as Martin Pike came into the strong lamplight out of the
dimness of the hall where only a taper burned He shambled a few limp
steps into the room and came to a halt Big as he was his clothes
hung upon him loosely like coverlets upon a collapsed bed and he
seemed but a distorted image of himself as if save for the dull and
reddened eyes he had been made of yellowish wax and had been left too
long in the sun Abject hopeless his attitude a confession of ruin
and shame he stood before his judges in such wretchedness that in
comparison the figure of Happy Fear facing the courtroom through his
darkest hour was one to be envied

Well he said brokenly what are you going to do

Joe Louden looked at him with great intentness for several moments
Then he rose and came forward Sit down Judge he said Its all
right Dont worry

THE JURY COMES IN

Mrs Flitcroft at breakfast on the following morning continued a
disquisition which had ceased the previous night only because of a
provoking human incapacity to exist without sleep Her theme was one
which had exclusively occupied her since the passing of Eskew and her
rheumatism having improved so that she could leave her chair she had
become a sort of walking serial Norbert and his grandfather being well
assured that whenever they left the house the same story was to be
continued upon their reappearance The Tocsin had been her great
comfort she was but one helpless woman against two strong men
therefore she sorely needed assistance in her attack upon them and the
invaluable newspaper gave it in generous measure

Yes young man she said as she lifted her first spoonful of
oatmeal you BETTER read the Tocsin

I AM reading it responded Norbert who was almost concealed by the
paper

And your grandfather better read it she continued severely

I already have said the Colonel promptly Have you

No but you can be sure I will The good lady gave the effect of
tossing her head And you better take what it says to heart you and
some others Its a wonder to me that you and Buckalew and old Peter
dont go and hold that Happy Fears hand durin the trial And as for
Joe Louden his stepmothers own sister Jane says to me only
yesterday afternoon Why law Mrs Flitcroft she says its a
wonder to me she says that your husband and those two other old
fools dont lay down in the gutter and let that Joe Louden walk over
em

Did Jane Quimby say those two other old fools inquired the
Colonel in a manner which indicated that he might see Mr Quimby in
regard to the slander

I cant say as I remember just precisely her exact words admitted
Mrs Flitcroft but that was the sense of em Youve made yourselves
the laughinstock of the whole town

Oh we have

And Id like to knowher voice became shrill and goadingId like
to know what Judge Pike thinks of you and Norbert I should think
youd be ashamed to have him pass you in the street

Ive quit speaking to him said Norbert coldly ever since I heard
he owned Beaver Beach

That story aint proved yet returned his grandmother with much
irascibility

Well it will be but thats not all Norbert wagged his head You
may be a little surprised within the next few days

Ive been surprised for the PAST few she replied with a bitterness
which overrode her satisfaction in the effectiveness of the retort
Surprised Id like to know who wouldnt be surprised when half the
town acts like its gone crazy People PRAISIN that fellow that
nobody in their sober minds and senses never in their lives had a good
word for before Why there was more talk yesterday about his doins
at the Courthouseyoud of thought he was Phil Sheridan Its Joe
Louden here and Joe Louden there and Joe Louden this and Joe
Louden that till Im sick of the name

Then why dont you quit saying it asked the Colonel reasonably

Because itd OUGHT to be said she exclaimed with great heat
Because hed ought to be held up to the community to be despised You
let me have that paper a minute she pursued vehemently you just
let me have the Tocsin and Ill read you out some things about him that
ll show him in his true light

All right said Norbert suddenly handing her the paper Go ahead

And after the exchange of a single glance the two gentlemen composed
themselves to listen

Ha exclaimed Mrs Flitcroft Here it is in headlines on the first
page Defence Scores Again and Again Ridiculous Behavior of a
WouldBe Mob Loudens She paused removed her spectacles
examined them dubiously restored them to place and continued
Loudens Masterly Conduct and WellDeserved she paused again
incredulousWellDeserved Triumph

Go on said the Colonel softly

Indeed I will the old lady replied Do you think I dont know
sarcasm when I see it Ha ha She laughed with great heartiness
I reckon I WILL go on You listen and try to LEARN something from
it She resumed the reading

It is generally admitted that after yesterdays sitting of the court
the prosecution in the FearCory murder trial has not a leg to stand
on Loudens fight for his client has been it must be confessed of a
most splendid and talented order and the bottom has fallen out of the
case for the State while a verdict of Not Guilty it is now conceded
is the general wish of those who have attended and followed the trial
But the most interesting event of the day took place after the session
when some miscreants undertook to mob the attorney for the defence in
the Courthouse yard He met the attack with a coolness and nerve
which have won him a popularity that Mrs Flitcroft again faltered

Go on repeated the Colonel Theres a great deal more

Look at the editorials suggested Norbert Theres one on the same
subject

Mrs Flitcroft her theory of the Tocsins sarcasm somewhat shaken
turned the page We Confess a Mistake was the rubric above the
leader and she uttered a cry of triumph for she thought the mistake
was what she had just been reading and that the editorial would
apologize for the incomprehensible journalistic error upon the first
page The best of us make mistakes and it is well to have a change
of heart sometimes Thus Eugenes successor had written and so
Mrs Flitcroft read An open confession is good for the soul The
Tocsin has changed its mind in regard to certain matters and means to
say so freely and frankly After yesterdays events in connection with
the murder trial before our public the evidence being now all
presented for we understand that neither side has more to offer it is
generally conceded that all good citizens are hopeful of a verdict of
acquittal and the Tocsin is a good citizen No good citizen would
willingly see an innocent man punished and that our city is not to be
disgraced by such a miscarriage of justice is due to the efforts of the
attorney for the defendant who has gained credit not only by his
masterly management of this case but by his splendid conduct in the
face of danger yesterday afternoon He has distinguished himself so
greatly that we frankly assert that our citizens may point with pride
to Mrs Flitcrofts voice at the beginning pitched to a high
exultation had gradually lowered in key and dropped down the scale
till it disappeared altogether

Its a wonder to me the Colonel began that the Tocsin doesnt go
and hold Joe Loudens hand

Ill read the rest of it for you said Norbert his heavy face
lighting up with cruelty Lets seewhere were you Oh yespoint
with pride Our citizens may point with pride to 

Let us not linger to observe the unmanly behavior of an aged man and
his grandson left alone at the breakfasttable by a defenceless woman

The Tocsins rightaboutface undermined others besides Mrs Flitcroft
that morning and rejoiced greater though not better men than the
Colonel Mr Farbach and his lieutenants smiled yet stared amazed
wondering what had happened That was a thing which only three people
even certainly knew yet it was very simple

The Tocsin was part of the Judges restitution

The controlling interest in the paper together with the other
property I have listed Joe had said studying his memoranda under the
lamp in Rogers old studio while Martin Pike listened with his head in
his hands make up what Miss Tabor is willing to accept As I
estimate it their total value is between a third and a half of that of
the stock which belonged to her

But this boythis Flitcroft said Pike feebly he might

He will do nothing interrupted Joe The case is settled out of
court and even if he were disposed to harass you he could hardly
hope to succeed since Miss Tabor declines either to sue or to
prosecute

The Judge winced at the last word Yesyes I know but he mighthe
mighttell

I think Miss Tabors influence will prevent If it should notwell
youre not in a desperate case by any means youre involved but far
from stripped in time you may be as sound as ever And if Norbert
tells theres nothing for you to do but to live it down A faint
smile played upon Joes lips as he lifted his head and looked at the
other It can be done I think

It was then that Ariel complaining of the warmth of the evening
thought it possible that Joe might find her fan upon the porch and as
he departed whispered hurriedly Judge Pike Im not technically in
control of the Tocsin but havent I the right to control its policy

I understand he muttered You mean about Loudenabout this
trial

That is why I have taken the paper

You want all that changed you mean

She nodded decisively From this instant Before morning

Oh well Ill go down there and give the word He rubbed his eyes
wearily with big thumbs Im through fighting Im done Besides
whats the use Theres nothing more to fight

Now Judge Joe said as he came in briskly well go over the list
of that unencumbered property if you will

This unencumbered property consisted of Beaver Beach and those other
belongings of the Judge which he had not dared to mortgage Joe had
somehow explained their nature to Ariel and these with the Tocsin she
had elected to accept in restitution

You told me once that I ought to look after my own property and now I
will Dont you see she cried to Joe eagerly Its my work She
resolutely set aside every other proposition and this was the quality
of mercy which Martin Pike found that night


There was a great crowd to hear Joes summingup at the trial and
those who succeeded in getting into the courtroom declared that it was
worth the struggle He did not orate he did not thunder at the
jury nor did he slyly flatter them he did not overdo the
confidential nor seem so secure of understanding beforehand what their
verdict would be that they felt an instinctive desire to fool him He
talked colloquially but clearly without appeal to the pathetic and
without garnitures not mentioning sunsets birds oceans homes the
glorious old State or the happiness of liberty but he made everybody
in the room quite sure that Happy Fear had fired the shot which killed
Cory to save his own life And that as Mr Bradbury remarked to the
Colonel was what Joe was THERE for

Ariels escort was increased to four that day Mr Ladew sat beside
her and there were times when Joe kept his mind entirely to the work
in hand only by an effort but he always succeeded The sight of the
pale and worshipping face of Happy Fear from the corner of his eye was
enough to insure that And people who could not get near the doors
asking those who could Whats he doin now were answered by
variations of the one formula Oh jest walkin away with it

Once the courtroom was disturbed and set in an uproar which even the
Judges customary threat failed to subdue Joe had been talking very
rapidly and having turned the point he was making with perfect
dexterity the jury listening eagerly stopped for a moment to take a
swallow of water A voice rose over the low hum of the crowd in a
delirious chuckle Why dont somebody HEAD HIM OFF The room
instantly rocked with laughter under cover of which the identity of
the sacrilegious chuckler was not discovered but the voice was the
voice of Buckalew who was incredibly surprised to find that he had
spoken aloud

The jury were out after the case had been given to them seventeen
minutes and thirty seconds by the watch Claudine held in her hand The
little man whose fate was now on the knees of the gods looked
pathetically at the foreman and then at the face of his lawyer and
began to shake violently but not with fright He had gone to the jail
on Joes word as a good dog goes where his master bids trustfully
and yet Happy had not been able to keep his mind from considering the
horrible chances Dont worry Joe had said Its all right Ill
see you through And he had kept his word

The little man was cleared

It took Happy a long time to get through what he had to say to his
attorney in the anteroom and even then of course he did not manage
to put it in words for he had broken down with sheer gratitude
Why damn ME Joe he sobbed if ever Iif ever youwell by God
if you ever This was the substance of his lingual accomplishment
under the circumstances But Claudine threw her arms around poor Joes
neck and kissed him

Many people were waiting to shake hands with Joe and congratulate him
The trio taking advantage of seats near the rail had already done
that somewhat uproariously before he had followed Happy and so had
Ariel and Ladew both necessarily rather hurriedly But in the
corridors he found when he came out of the anteroom clients
acquaintances friends old friends new friends and friends he had
never seen beforeeverybody beaming upon him and wringing his hand as
if they had been sure of it all from the start

KNOW him said one to another Why Ive knowed him sence he was
that high SMART little feller he was too This was a total
stranger

I said years agothus Mr Brown the National House clerk
proving his prophetic visionthat hed turn out to be a big man some
day

They gathered round him if he stopped for an instant and crowded after
him admiringly when he went on again making his progress slow When
he finally came out of the big doors into the sunshine there were as
many people in the yard as there had been when he stood in the same
place and watched the mob rushing his clients guards But today their
temper was different and as he paused a moment looking down on the
upturned laughing faces with a hundred jocular and congratulatory
salutations shouted up at him somebody started a cheer and it was
taken up with thunderous goodwill

There followed the interrogation customary in such emergencies and the
anxious inquirer was informed by four or five hundred people
simultaneously that Joe Louden was all right

HEAD HIM OFF bellowed Mike Sheehan suddenly darting up the steps
The shout increased and with good reason for he stepped quickly back
within the doors and retreating through the building made good his
escape by a basement door

He struck off into a long detour but though he managed to evade the
crowd he had to stop and shake hands with every third person he met
As he came out upon Main Street again he encountered his father

Howdy do Joe said this laconic person and offered his hand They
shook briefly Well he continued rubbing his beard how are ye

All right father I think

Satisfied with the verdict

Id be pretty hard to please if I werent Joe laughed

Mr Louden rubbed his beard again I was there he said without
emotion

At the trial you mean

Yes He offered his hand once more and again they shook Well
come around and see us he said

Thank you I will

Well said Mr Louden goodday Joe

Goodday father


The young man stood looking after him with a curious smile Then he
gave a slight start Far up the street he saw two figures one a
ladys in white with a wide white hat the other a mans wearing
recognizably clerical black They seemed to be walking very slowly

It had been a day of triumph for Joe but in all his life he never
slept worse than he did that night



XXVI

ANCIENT OF DAYS

He woke to the chiming of bells and as his eyes slowly opened the
sorrowful people of a dream who seemed to be bending over him
weeping swam back into the darkness of the night whence they had come
and returned to the imperceptible leaving their shadows in his heart
Slowly he rose stumbled into the outer room and released the
fluttering shade but the sunshine springing like a golden lover
through the open window only dazzled him and found no answering
gladness to greet it nor joy in the royal day it heralded

And yet to the newly cleaned boys on their way to midsummer morning
Sundayschool the breath of that cool August day was as sweet as
stolen apples No doubt the stir of far green thickets and the
twinkle of silverslippered creeks shimmered in the longing vision of
their minds eyes even so they were merry But Joseph Louden
sighing as he descended his narrow stairs with the bitterness still
upon his lips of the frightful coffee he had made heard the echo of
their laughter with wonder

It would be an hour at least before time to start to church when Ariel
expected him he stared absently up the street then down and after
that began slowly to walk in the latter direction with no very active
consciousness or care of where he went He had fallen into a
profound reverie so deep that when he had crossed the bridge and
turned into a dusty road which ran along the riverbank he stopped
mechanically beside the trunk of a fallen sycamore and lifting his
head for the first time since he had set out looked about him with a
melancholy perplexity a little surprised to find himself there

For this was the spot where he had first seen the new Ariel and on
that fallen sycamore they had sat together REMEMBER ACROSS MAIN
STREET BRIDGE AT NOON And Joes cheeks burned as he recalled why he
had not understood the clear voice that had haunted him But that
shame had fallen from him she had changed all that as she had changed
so many things He sank down in the long grass with his back against
the log and stared out over the fields of tall corn shaking in a
steady wind all the way to the horizon

Changed so many things he said half aloud Everything Ah yes
she had changed the whole world for Joseph Loudenat his first sight
of her And now it seemed to him that he was to lose her but not in
the way he had thought

Almost from the very first he had the feeling that nothing so
beautiful as that she should stay in Canaan could happen to him He
was sure that she was but for the little while that her coming was
like the flying petals of which he had told her

He had lain upon the earth and she had lifted him up For a moment he
had felt the beatific wings enfolding him with gentle protection and
then saw them lifted to bear the angel beyond his sight For it was
incredible that the gods so loved Joe Louden that they would make
greater gifts to him than this little time with her which they had
granted him

Changed so many things

The bars that had been between him and half of his world were down
shattered never more to be replaced and the ban of Canaan was lifted
Could this have been save for her And upon that thought he got to
his feet uttering an exclamation of bitter selfreproach asking
himself angrily what he was doing He knew how much she gave him what
full measure of her affection Was not that enoughOut upon you
Louden Are you to sulk in your tent dour in the gloom or to play a
mans part and if she be happy turn a cheery face upon her joy

And thus this pilgrim recrossed the bridge emerging to the street with
his head up smiling and his shoulders thrown back so that none might
see the burden he carried


Ariel was waiting on the porch for him She wore the same dress she
had worn that Sunday of their tryst that exquisite dress with the
faint lavender overtint like the tender colors of the beautiful day he
made his own She had not worn it since and he was far distant when
he caught the first flickering glimpse of her through the lower
branches of the maples but he remembered And again as on that
day he heard a faraway ineffable music the Elfland horns sounding
the mysterious reveille which had wakened his soul to her coming

She came to the gate to meet him and gave him her hand in greeting
without a wordor the need of onefrom either Then together they
set forth over the sunflecked pavement the maples swishing above
them heavier branches crooning in the strong breeze under a sky like
a Della Robbia background And up against the glorious blue of it
some laughing invisible god was blowing small rounded clouds of pure
cotton as children blow thistledown

When he opened her parasol as they came out into the broad sunshine
beyond Upper Main Street there was the faintest mingling of wild roses
and cinnamon loosed on the air

Joe she said Im very happy

Thats right he returned heartily I think you always will be

But oh I wish she went on that Mr Arp could have lived to see
you come down the Courthouse steps

God bless him said Joe I can hear the argument

Those dear old men have been so loyal to you Joe

No he returned loyal to Eskew

To you both she said Im afraid the old circle is broken up they
havent met on the National House corner since he died The Colonel
told me he couldnt bear to go there again

I dont believe any of them ever will he returned And yet I never
pass the place that I dont see Eskew in his old chair I went there
last night to commune with him I couldnt sleep and I got up and
went over there theyd left the chairs out the town was asleep and
it was beautiful moonlight

To commune with him What about

You

Why she asked plainly mystified

I stood in need of good counsel he answered cheerfully or a
friendly word perhaps andas I sat thereafter a while it came

What was it

To forget that I was sodden with selfishness to pretend not to be as
full of meanness as I really was Doesnt that seem to be Eskews own
voice

Werent you happy last night Joe

Oh it was all right he said quickly Dont you worry

And at this old speech of his she broke into a little laugh of which he
had no comprehension

Mamie came to see me early this morning she said after they had
walked on in silence for a time Everything is all right with her
again that is I think it will be Eugene is coming home And she
added thoughtfully it will be best for him to have his old place on
the Tocsin again She showed me his letter and I liked it I think
hes been through the fire

Joes distorted smile appeared And has come out gold he asked

No she laughed but nearer it And I think hell try to be more
worth her caring for She has always thought that his leaving the
Tocsin in the way he did was heroic That was her word for it And it
WAS the finest thing he ever did

I cant figure Eugene out Joe shook his head Theres something
behind his going away that I dont understand This was altogether
the truth nor was there ever to come a time when either he or Mamie
would understand what things had determined the departure of Eugene
Bantry though Mamie never questioned as Joe did the reasons for it
or doubted those Eugene had given her which were the same he had given
her father For she was content with his return


Again the bells across the Square rang out their chime The paths were
decorously enlivened with family and neighborhood groups bound
churchward and the rumble of the organ playing the people into their
pews shook on the air And Joe knew that he must speak quickly if he
was to say what he had planned to say before he and Ariel went into
the church

Ariel He tried to compel his voice to a casual cheerfulness but it
would do nothing for him except betray a desperate embarrassment

She looked at him quickly and as quickly away

Yes

I wanted to say something to you and Id better do it now I
thinkbefore I go to church for the first time in two years He
managed to laugh though with some ruefulness and continued
stammeringly I want to tell you how much I like himhow much I
admire him

Admire whom she asked a little coldly for she knew

Mr Ladew

So do I she answered looking straight ahead That is one reason
why I wanted you to come with me today

It isnt only that I want to tell youto tell you He broke off
for a second You remember that night in my office before Fear came
in

Yes I remember

And that Ithat something I said troubled you because itit sounded
as if I cared too much for you

No not too much She still looked straight ahead They were
walking very slowly You didnt understand Youd been in my mind
you see all those years so much more than I in yours I hadnt
forgotten YOU But to you I was really a stranger

No no he cried

Yes I was she said gently but very quickly And II didnt want
you to fall in love with me at first sight And yetperhaps I did
But I hadnt thought of things in that way I had just the same
feeling for you that I always hadalways I had never cared so much
for any one else and it seemed to me the most necessary thing in my
life to come back to that old companionship Dont you rememberit
used to trouble you so when I would take your hand I think I loved
your being a little rough with me And once when I saw how you had
been hurt that day you ran away

Ariel he gasped helplessly

Have you forgotten

He gathered himself together with all his will I want to prove to
you he said resolutely that the dear kindness of you isnt thrown
away on me I want you to know what I began to say that its all right
with me and I think Ladew He stopped again Ah Ive seen how
much he cares for you

Have you

Ariel he said that isnt fair to me if you trust me You could
not have helped seeing

But I have not seen it she interrupted with great calmness After
having said this she finished truthfully If he did I would never
let him tell me I like him too much

You mean youre not going to

Suddenly she turned to him NO she said with a depth of anger he
had not heard in her voice since that longago winter day when she
struck Eugene Bantry with her clenched fist She swept over him a
blinding look of reproach How could I

And there upon the steps of the church in the sudden dazzling vision
of her love fell the burden of him who had made his sorrowful
pilgrimage across Main Street bridge that morning


A manifold rustling followed them as they went down the aisle and the
sibilance of many whisperings but Joe was not conscious of that as he
took his place in Ariels pew beside her For him there was only the
presence of divinity the church was filled with it


They rose to sing

 Ancient of days Who sittest throned in glory
 To Thee all knees are bent all voices pray
 Thy love has blest the wide worlds wondrous story
 With light and life since Edens dawning day


And then as they knelt to pray there were the white heads of the
three old friends of Eskew Arp and beyond was the silver hair of
Martin Pike who knelt beside his daughter Joe felt that people
should be very kind to the Judge


The sun so eager without came temperately through the windows where
stood angels and saints in gentle colors and the face of the young
minister in this quiet light was like the faces in the windows

Not only to confront your enemies he said that is not enough nor
is it that I would have you bluster at them nor take arms against
them you will not have to do that if when they come at you you do
not turn one inch aside but with an assured heart with good nature
not noisily and with steadfastness you keep on your way If you can
do that I say that they will turn aside for you and you shall walk
straight through them and only laughter be left of their anger

There was a stir among the people and many faces turned toward Joe
Two years ago he had sat in the same church when his character and
actions had furnished the underlying theme of a sermon and he had
recognized himself without difficulty today he had not the shadow of
a dream that the same thing was happening He thought the people were
turning to look at Ariel and he was very far from wondering at that

She saw that he did not understand she was glad to have it so She
had taken off her gloves and he was holding them lightly and
reverently in his hands looking down upon them his thin cheeks a
little flushed And at that and not knowing the glory that was in his
soul something forlorn in his careful tenderness toward her gloves so
touched her that she felt the tears coming to her eyes with a sudden
rush And to prevent them

Not the empty gloves Joe she whispered

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including including checks online payments and credit card
