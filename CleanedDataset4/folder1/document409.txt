P R E F A C E

THE following POEMS were written originally for the Amusement of the
Author as they were the Products of her leisure Moments She had no
Intention ever to have published them nor would they now have made
their Appearance but at the Importunity of many of her best and most
generous Friends to whom she considers herself as under the greatest
Obligations

As her Attempts in Poetry are now sent into the World it is hoped the
Critic will not severely censure their Defects and we presume they
have too much Merit to be cast aside with Contempt as worthless and
trifling Effusions

As to the Disadvantages she has laboured under with Regard to Learning
nothing needs to be offered as her Masters Letter in the following
Page will sufficiently show the Difficulties in this Respect she had to
encounter

With all their Imperfections the Poems are now humbly submitted to the
Perusal of the Public



The following is a Copy of a LETTER sent by the Authors Master to the
Publisher

PHILLIS was brought from Africa to America in the Year 1761 between
seven and eight Years of Age Without any Assistance from School
Education and by only what she was taught in the Family she in
sixteen Months Time from her Arrival attained the English language
to which she was an utter Stranger before to such a degree as to
read any the most difficult Parts of the Sacred Writings to the
great Astonishment of all who heard her

As to her WRITING her own Curiosity led her to it and this she learnt
in so short a Time that in the Year 1765 she wrote a Letter to the
Rev Mr OCCOM the Indian Minister while in England

She has a great Inclination to learn the Latin Tongue and has made some
Progress in it This Relation is given by her Master who bought her
and with whom she now lives

 To M AE C E N A S

 MAECENAS you beneath the myrtle shade
 Read oer what poets sung and shepherds playd
 What felt those poets but you feel the same
 Does not your soul possess the sacred flame
 Their noble strains your equal genius shares
 In softer language and diviner airs
 While Homer paints lo circumfusd in air
 Celestial Gods in mortal forms appear
 Swift as they move hear each recess rebound
 Heavn quakes earth trembles and the shores resound
 Great Sire of verse before my mortal eyes
 The lightnings blaze across the vaulted skies
 And as the thunder shakes the heavnly plains
 A deep felt horror thrills through all my veins
 When gentler strains demand thy graceful song
 The lengthning line moves languishing along
 When great Patroclus courts Achilles aid
 The grateful tribute of my tears is paid
 Prone on the shore he feels the pangs of love
 And stern Pelides tendrest passions move
 Great Maros strain in heavnly numbers flows
 The Nine inspire and all the bosom glows
 O could I rival thine and Virgils page
 Or claim the Muses with the Mantuan Sage
 Soon the same beauties should my mind adorn
 And the same ardors in my soul should burn
 Then should my song in bolder notes arise
 And all my numbers pleasingly surprise
 But here I sit and mourn a grovling mind
 That fain would mount and ride upon the wind
 Not you my friend these plaintive strains become
 Not you whose bosom is the Muses home
 When they from towring Helicon retire
 They fan in you the bright immortal fire
 But I less happy cannot raise the song
 The faultring music dies upon my tongue
 The happier Terence all the choir inspird
 His soul replenishd and his bosom fird
 But say ye Muses why this partial grace
 To one alone of Africs sable race
 From age to age transmitting thus his name
 With the finest glory in the rolls of fame
 Thy virtues great Maecenas shall be sung
 In praise of him from whom those virtues sprung
 While blooming wreaths around thy temples spread
 Ill snatch a laurel from thine honourd head
 While you indulgent smile upon the deed

 He was an African by birth

 As long as Thames in streams majestic flows
 Or Naiads in their oozy beds repose
 While Phoebus reigns above the starry train
 While bright Aurora purples oer the main
 So long great Sir the muse thy praise shall sing
 So long thy praise shal make Parnassus ring
 Then grant Maecenas thy paternal rays
 Hear me propitious and defend my lays



 O N V I R T U E

 O Thou bright jewel in my aim I strive
 To comprehend thee Thine own words declare
 Wisdom is higher than a fool can reach
 I cease to wonder and no more attempt
 Thine height t explore or fathom thy profound
 But O my soul sink not into despair
 Virtue is near thee and with gentle hand
 Would now embrace thee hovers oer thine head
 Fain would the heavnborn soul with her converse
 Then seek then court her for her promisd bliss
 Auspicious queen thine heavnly pinions spread
 And lead celestial Chastity along
 Lo now her sacred retinue descends
 Arrayd in glory from the orbs above
 Attend me Virtue thro my youthful years
 O leave me not to the false joys of time
 But guide my steps to endless life and bliss
 Greatness or Goodness say what I shall call thee
 To give me an higher appellation still
 Teach me a better strain a nobler lay
 O thou enthrond with Cherubs in the realms of day



 TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE IN NEWENGLAND

 WHILE an intrinsic ardor prompts to write
 The muses promise to assist my pen
 Twas not long since I left my native shore
 The land of errors and Egyptian gloom
 Father of mercy twas thy gracious hand
 Brought me in safety from those dark abodes
 Students to you tis givn to scan the heights
 Above to traverse the ethereal space
 And mark the systems of revolving worlds
 Still more ye sons of science ye receive
 The blissful news by messengers from heavn
 How Jesus blood for your redemption flows
 See him with hands outstretcht upon the cross
 Immense compassion in his bosom glows
 He hears revilers nor resents their scorn
 What matchless mercy in the Son of God
 When the whole human race by sin had falln
 He deignd to die that they might rise again
 And share with him in the sublimest skies
 Life without death and glory without end
 Improve your privileges while they stay
 Ye pupils and each hour redeem that bears
 Or good or bad report of you to heavn
 Let sin that baneful evil to the soul
 By you be shund nor once remit your guard
 Suppress the deadly serpent in its egg
 Ye blooming plants of human race divine
 An Ethiop tells you tis your greatest foe
 Its transient sweetness turns to endless pain
 And in immense perdition sinks the soul



 TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY 1768

 YOUR subjects hope dread Sire
 The crown upon your brows may flourish long
 And that your arm may in your God be strong
 O may your sceptre numrous nations sway
 And all with love and readiness obey
 But how shall we the British king reward
 Rule thou in peace our father and our lord
 Midst the remembrance of thy favours past
 The meanest peasants most admire the last
 May George beloved by all the nations round
 Live with heavns choicest constant blessings crownd
 Great God direct and guard him from on high
 And from his head let evry evil fly
 And may each clime with equal gladness see
 A monarchs smile can set his subjects free

  The Repeal of the Stamp Act


 On being brought from Africa to America

 TWAS mercy brought me from my Pagan land
 Taught my benighted soul to understand
 That theres a God that theres a Saviour too
 Once I redemption neither fought nor knew
 Some view our sable race with scornful eye
 Their colour is a diabolic die
 Remember Christians Negroes black as Cain
 May be refind and join th angelic train



 On the Death of the Rev Dr SEWELL 1769

 ERE yet the morn its lovely blushes spread
 See Sewell numberd with the happy dead
 Hail holy man arrivd th immortal shore
 Though we shall hear thy warning voice no more
 Come let us all behold with wishful eyes
 The saint ascending to his native skies
 From hence the prophet wingd his raptrous way
 To the blest mansions in eternal day
 Then begging for the Spirit of our God
 And panting eager for the same abode
 Come let us all with the same vigour rise
 And take a prospect of the blissful skies
 While on our minds Christs image is imprest
 And the dear Saviour glows in evry breast
 Thrice happy saint to find thy heavn at last
 What compensation for the evils past
 Great God incomprehensible unknown
 By sense we bow at thine exalted throne
 O while we beg thine excellence to feel
 Thy sacred Spirit to our hearts reveal
 And give us of that mercy to partake
 Which thou hast promisd for the Saviours sake
 Sewell is dead Swiftpiniond Fame thus cryd
 Is Sewell dead my trembling tongue replyd
 O what a blessing in his flight denyd
 How oft for us the holy prophet prayd
 How oft to us the Word of Life conveyd
 By duty urgd my mournful verse to close
 I for his tomb this epitaph compose
 Lo here a man redeemd by Jesuss blood
 A sinner once but now a saint with God
 Behold ye rich ye poor ye fools ye wise
 Not let his monument your heart surprise
 Twill tell you what this holy man has done
 Which gives him brighter lustre than the sun
 Listen ye happy from your seats above
 I speak sincerely while I speak and love
 He fought the paths of piety and truth
 By these made happy from his early youth
 In blooming years that grace divine he felt
 Which rescues sinners from the chains of guilt
 Mourn him ye indigent whom he has fed
 And henceforth seek like him for living bread
 Evn Christ the bread descending from above
 And ask an intrest in his saving love
 Mourn him ye youth to whom he oft has told
 Gods gracious wonders from the times of old
 I too have cause this mighty loss to mourn
 For he my monitor will not return
 O when shall we to his blest state arrive
 When the same graces in our bosoms thrive



 On the Death of the Rev Mr GEORGE WHITEFIELD 1770

 HAIL happy saint on thine immortal throne
 Possest of glory life and bliss unknown
 We hear no more the music of thy tongue
 Thy wonted auditories cease to throng
 Thy sermons in unequalld accents flowd
 And evry bosom with devotion glowd
 Thou didst in strains of eloquence refind
 Inflame the heart and captivate the mind
 Unhappy we the setting sun deplore
 So glorious once but ah it shines no more
 Behold the prophet in his towring flight
 He leaves the earth for heavns unmeasurd height
 And worlds unknown receive him from our sight
 There Whitefield wings with rapid course his way
 And sails to Zion through vast seas of day
 Thy prayrs great saint and thine incessant cries
 Have piercd the bosom of thy native skies
 Thou moon hast seen and all the stars of light
 How he has wrestled with his God by night
 He prayd that grace in evry heart might dwell
 He longd to see America excell
 He chargd its youth that evry grace divine
 Should with full lustre in their conduct shine
 That Saviour which his soul did first receive
 The greatest gift that evn a God can give
 He freely offerd to the numrous throng
 That on his lips with listning pleasure hung
 Take him ye wretched for your only good
 Take him ye starving sinners for your food
 Ye thirsty come to this lifegiving stream
 Ye preachers take him for your joyful theme
 Take him my dear Americans he said
 Be your complaints on his kind bosom laid
 Take him ye Africans he longs for you
 Impartial Saviour is his title due
 Washd in the fountain of redeeming blood
 You shall be sons and kings and priests to God
 Great Countess we Americans revere
 Thy name and mingle in thy grief sincere
 New England deeply feels the Orphans mourn
 Their more than father will no more return
 But though arrested by the hand of death
 Whitefield no more exerts his labring breath
 Yet let us view him in th eternal skies
 Let evry heart to this bright vision rise
 While the tomb safe retains its sacred trust
 Till life divine reanimates his dust

 The Countess of Huntingdon to whom Mr Whitefield was Chaplain



 On the Death of a young Lady of Five Years of Age

 FROM dark abodes to fair etherial light
 Th enrapturd innocent has wingd her flight
 On the kind bosom of eternal love
 She finds unknown beatitude above
 This known ye parents nor her loss deplore
 She feels the iron hand of pain no more
 The dispensations of unerring grace
 Should turn your sorrows into grateful praise
 Let then no tears for her henceforward flow
 No more distressd in our dark vale below
 Her morning sun which rose divinely bright
 Was quickly mantled with the gloom of night
 But hear in heavns blest bowrs your Nancy fair
 And learn to imitate her language there
 Thou Lord whom I behold with glory crownd
 By what sweet name and in what tuneful sound
 Wilt thou be praisd Seraphic powrs are faint
 Infinite love and majesty to paint
 To thee let all their graceful voices raise
 And saints and angels join their songs of praise
 Perfect in bliss she from her heavnly home
 Looks down and smiling beckons you to come
 Why then fond parents why these fruitless groans
 Restrain your tears and cease your plaintive moans
 Freed from a world of sin and snares and pain
 Why would you wish your daughter back again
 Nobow resignd Let hope your grief control
 And check the rising tumult of the soul
 Calm in the prosperous and adverse day
 Adore the God who gives and takes away
 Eye him in all his holy name revere
 Upright your actions and your hearts sincere
 Till having saild through lifes tempestuous sea
 And from its rocks and boistrous billows free
 Yourselves safe landed on the blissful shore
 Shall join your happy babe to part no more



 On the Death of a young Gentleman

 WHO taught thee conflict with the powrs of night
 To vanquish satan in the fields of light
 Who strung thy feeble arms with might unknown
 How great thy conquest and how bright thy crown
 War with each princedom throne and powr is oer
 The scene is ended to return no more
 O could my muse thy seat on high behold
 How deckt with laurel how enrichd with gold
 O could she hear what praise thine harp employs
 How sweet thine anthems how divine thy joys
 What heavnly grandeur should exalt her strain
 What holy raptures in her numbers reign
 To sooth the troubles of the mind to peace
 To still the tumult of lifes tossing seas
 To ease the anguish of the parents heart
 What shall my sympathizing verse impart
 Where is the balm to heal so deep a wound
 Where shall a sovreign remedy be found
 Look gracious Spirit from thine heavnly bowr
 And thy full joys into their bosoms pour
 The raging tempest of their grief control
 And spread the dawn of glory through the soul
 To eye the path the saint departed trod
 And trace him to the bosom of his God



 To a Lady on the Death of her Husband

 GRIM monarch see deprivd of vital breath
 A young physician in the dust of death
 Dost thou go on incessant to destroy
 Our griefs to double and lay waste our joy
 Enough thou never yet wast known to say
 Though millions die the vassals of thy sway
 Nor youth nor science not the ties of love
 Nor ought on earth thy flinty heart can move
 The friend the spouse from his dire dart to save
 In vain we ask the sovereign of the grave
 Fair mourner there see thy lovd Leonard laid
 And oer him spread the deep impervious shade
 Closd are his eyes and heavy fetters keep
 His senses bound in neverwaking sleep
 Till time shall cease till many a starry world
 Shall fall from heavn in dire confusion hurld
 Till nature in her final wreck shall lie
 And her last groan shall rend the azure sky
 Not not till then his active soul shall claim
 His body a divine immortal frame
 But see the softlystealing tears apace
 Pursue each other down the mourners face
 But cease thy tears bid evry sigh depart
 And cast the load of anguish from thine heart
 From the cold shell of his great soul arise
 And look beyond thou native of the skies
 There fix thy view where fleeter than the wind
 Thy Leonard mounts and leaves the earth behind
 Thyself prepare to pass the vale of night
 To join for ever on the hills of light
 To thine embrace this joyful spirit moves
 To thee the partner of his earthly loves
 He welcomes thee to pleasures more refind
 And better suited to th immortal mind

 1 SAMUEL Chap xvii

 YE martial powrs and all ye tuneful nine
 Inspire my song and aid my high design
 The dreadful scenes and toils of war I write
 The ardent warriors and the fields of fight
 You best remember and you best can sing
 The acts of heroes to the vocal string
 Resume the lays with which your sacred lyre
 Did then the poet and the sage inspire
 Now front to front the armies were displayd
 Here Israel rangd and there the foes arrayd
 The hosts on two opposing mountains stood
 Thick as the foliage of the waving wood
 Between them an extensive valley lay
 Oer which the gleaming armour pourd the day
 When from the camp of the Philistine foes
 Dreadful to view a mighty warrior rose
 In the dire deeds of bleeding battle skilld
 The monster stalks the terror of the field
 From Gath he sprung Goliath was his name
 Of fierce deportment and gigantic frame
 A brazen helmet on his head was placd
 A coat of mail his form terrific gracd
 The greaves his legs the targe his shoulders prest
 Dreadful in arms hightowring oer the rest
 A spear he proudly wavd whose iron head
 Strange to relate six hundred shekels weighd
 He strode along and shook the ample field
 While Phoebus blazd refulgent on his shield
 Through Jacobs race a chilling horror ran
 When thus the huge enormous chief began
 Say what the cause that in this proud array
 You set your battle in the face of day
 One hero find in all your vaunting train
 Then see who loses and who wins the plain
 For he who wins in triumph may demand
 Perpetual service from the vanquishd land
 Your armies I defy your force despise
 By far inferior in Philistias eyes
 Produce a man and let us try the fight
 Decide the contest and the victors right
 Thus challengd he all Israel stood amazd
 And evry chief in consternation gazd
 But Jesses son in youthful bloom appears
 And warlike courage far beyond his years
 He left the folds he left the flowry meads
 And soft recesses of the sylvan shades
 Now Israels monarch and his troops arise
 With peals of shouts ascending to the skies
 In Elahs vale the scene of combat lies
 When the fair morning blushd with orient red
 What Davids fire enjoind the son obeyd
 And swift of foot towards the trench he came
 Where glowd each bosom with the martial flame
 He leaves his carriage to anothers care
 And runs to greet his brethren of the war
 While yet they spake the giantchief arose
 Repeats the challenge and insults his foes
 Struck with the sound and trembling at the view
 Affrighted Israel from its post withdrew
 Observe ye this tremendous foe they cryd
 Who in proud vaunts our armies hath defyd
 Whoever lays him prostrate on the plain
 Freedom in Israel for his house shall gain
 And on him wealth unknown the king will pour
 And give his royal daughter for his dowr
 Then Jesses youngest hope My brethren say
 What shall be done for him who takes away
 Reproach from Jacob who destroys the chief
 And puts a period to his countrys grief
 He vaunts the honours of his arms abroad
 And scorns the armies of the living God
 Thus spoke the youth th attentive people eyd
 The wondrous hero and again replyd
 Such the rewards our monarch will bestow
 On him who conquers and destroys his foe
 Eliab heard and kindled into ire
 To hear his shepherd brother thus inquire
 And thus begun What errand brought thee say
 Who keeps thy flock or does it go astray
 I know the base ambition of thine heart
 But back in safety from the field depart
 Eliab thus to Jesses youngest heir
 Expressd his wrath in accents most severe
 When to his brother mildly he replyd
 What have I done or what the cause to chide
 The words were told before the king who sent
 For the young hero to his royal tent
 Before the monarch dauntless he began
 For this Philistine fail no heart of man
 Ill take the vale and with the giant fight
 I dread not all his boasts nor all his might
 When thus the king Darst thou a stripling go
 And venture combat with so great a foe
 Who all his days has been inurd to fight
 And made its deeds his study and delight
 Battles and bloodshed brought the monster forth
 And clouds and whirlwinds usherd in his birth
 When David thus I kept the fleecy care
 And out there rushd a lion and a bear
 A tender lamb the hungry lion took
 And with no other weapon than my crook
 Bold I pursud and chas d him oer the field
 The prey deliverd and the felon killd
 As thus the lion and the bear I slew
 So shall Goliath fall and all his crew
 The God who savd me from these beasts of prey
 By me this monster in the dust shall lay
 So David spoke The wondring king replyd
 Go thou with heavn and victory on thy side
 This coat of mail this sword gird on he said
 And placd a mighty helmet on his head
 The coat the sword the helm he laid aside
 Nor chose to venture with those arms untryd
 Then took his staff and to the neighbring brook
 Instant he ran and thence five pebbles took
 Mean time descended to Philistias son
 A radiant cherub and he thus begun
 Goliath well thou knowst thou hast defyd
 Yon Hebrew armies and their God denyd
 Rebellious wretch audacious worm forbear
 Nor tempt the vengeance of their God too far
 Them who with his Omnipotence contend
 No eye shall pity and no arm defend
 Proud as thou art in short livd glory great
 I come to tell thee thine approaching fate
 Regard my words The Judge of all the gods
 Beneath whose steps the towring mountain nods
 Will give thine armies to the savage brood
 That cut the liquid air or range the wood
 Thee too a wellaimd pebble shall destroy
 And thou shalt perish by a beardless boy
 Such is the mandate from the realms above
 And should I try the vengeance to remove
 Myself a rebel to my king would prove
 Goliath say shall grace to him be shown
 Who dares heavns Monarch and insults his throne
 Your words are lost on me the giant cries
 While fear and wrath contended in his eyes
 When thus the messenger from heavn replies
 Provoke no more Jehovahs awful hand
 To hurl its vengeance on thy guilty land
 He grasps the thunder and he wings the storm
 Servants their sovreigns orders to perform
 The angel spoke and turnd his eyes away
 Adding new radiance to the rising day
 Now David comes the fatal stones demand
 His left the staff engagd his better hand
 The giant movd and from his towring height
 Surveyd the stripling and disdaind the fight
 And thus began Am I a dog with thee
 Bringst thou no armour but a staff to me
 The gods on thee their vollied curses pour
 And beasts and birds of prey thy flesh devour
 David undaunted thus Thy spear and shield
 Shall no protection to thy body yield
 Jehovahs nameno other arms I bear
 I ask no other in this glorious war
 Today the Lord of Hosts to me will give
 Victry today thy doom thou shalt receive
 The fate you threaten shall your own become
 And beasts shall be your animated tomb
 That all the earths inhabitants may know
 That theres a God who governs all below
 This great assembly too shall witness stand
 That needs nor sword nor spear th Almightys
 hand
 The battle his the conquest he bestows
 And to our powr consigns our hated foes
 Thus David spoke Goliath heard and came
 To meet the hero in the field of fame
 Ah fatal meeting to thy troops and thee
 But thou wast deaf to the divine decree
 Young David meets thee meets thee not in vain
 Tis thine to perish on th ensanguind plain
 And now the youth the forceful pebble slung
 Philistia trembled as it whizzd along
 In his dread forehead where the helmet ends
 Just oer the brows the wellaimd stone descends
 It piercd the skull and shatterd all the brain
 Prone on his face he tumbled to the plain
 Goliaths fall no smaller terror yields
 Than riving thunders in aerial fields
 The soul still lingred in its lovd abode
 Till conqring David oer the giant strode
 Goliaths sword then laid its master dead
 And from the body hewd the ghastly head
 The blood in gushing torrents drenchd the plains
 The soul found passage through the spouting veins
 And now aloud th illustrious victor said
 Where are your boastings now your champions
 dead
 Scarce had he spoke when the Philistines fled
 But fled in vain the conquror swift pursud
 What scenes of slaughter and what seas of blood
 There Saul thy thousands graspd th impurpled sand
 In pangs of death the conquest of thine hand
 And David there were thy ten thousands laid
 Thus Israels damsels musically playd
 Near Gath and Edron many an hero lay
 Breathd out their souls and cursd the light of day
 Their fury quenchd by death no longer burns
 And David with Goliaths head returns
 To Salem brought but in his tent he placd
 The load of armour which the giant gracd
 His monarch saw him coming from the war
 And thus demanded of the son of Ner
 Say who is this amazing youth he cryd
 When thus the leader of the host replyd
 As lives thy soul I know not whence he sprung
 So great in prowess though in years so young
 Inquire whose son is he the sovreign said
 Before whose conqring arm Philistia fled
 Before the king behold the stripling stand
 Goliaths head depending from his hand
 To him the king Say of what martial line
 Art thou young hero and what sire was thine
 He humbly thus The son of Jesse I
 I came the glories of the field to try
 Small is my tribe but valiant in the fight
 Small is my city but thy royal right
 Then take the promisd gifts the monarch cryd
 Conferring riches and the royal bride
 Knit to my soul for ever thou remain
 With me nor quit my regal roof again



 Thoughts on the WORKS OF PROVIDENCE

 A R I S E my soul on wings enrapturd rise
 To praise the monarch of the earth and skies
 Whose goodness and benificence appear
 As round its centre moves the rolling year
 Or when the morning glows with rosy charms
 Or the sun slumbers in the oceans arms
 Of light divine be a rich portion lent
 To guide my soul and favour my intend
 Celestial muse my arduous flight sustain
 And raise my mind to a seraphic strain
 Adord for ever be the God unseen
 Which round the sun revolves this vast machine
 Though to his eye its mass a point appears
 Adord the God that whirls surrounding spheres
 Which first ordaind that mighty Sol should reign
 The peerless monarch of th ethereal train
 Of miles twice forty millions is his height
 And yet his radiance dazzles mortal sight
 So far beneathfrom him th extended earth
 Vigour derives and evry flowry birth
 Vast through her orb she moves with easy grace
 Around her Phoebus in unbounded space
 True to her course th impetuous storm derides
 Triumphant oer the winds and surging tides
 Almighty in these wondrous works of thine
 What Powr what Wisdom and what Goodness shine
 And are thy wonders Lord by men explord
 And yet creating glory unadord
 Creation smiles in various beauty gay
 While day to night and night succeeds to day
 That Wisdom which attends Jehovahs ways
 Shines most conspicuous in the solar rays
 Without them destitute of heat and light
 This world would be the reign of endless night
 In their excess how would our race complain
 Abhorring life how hate its lengthned chain
 From air adust what numrous ills would rise
 What dire contagion taint the burning skies
 What pestilential vapours fraught with death
 Would rise and overspread the lands beneath
 Hail smiling morn that from the orient main
 Ascending dost adorn the heavnly plain
 So rich so various are thy beauteous dies
 That spread through all the circuit of the skies
 That full of thee my soul in rapture soars
 And thy great God the cause of all adores
 Oer beings infinite his love extends
 His Wisdom rules them and his Powr defends
 When tasks diurnal tire the human frame
 The spirits faint and dim the vital flame
 Then too that ever active bounty shines
 Which not infinity of space confines
 The sable veil that Night in silence draws
 Conceals effects but shows th Almighty Cause
 Night seals in sleep the wide creation fair
 And all is peaceful but the brow of care
 Again gay Phoebus as the day before
 Wakes evry eye but what shall wake no more
 Again the face of nature is renewd
 Which still appears harmonious fair and good
 May grateful strains salute the smiling morn
 Before its beams the eastern hills adorn
 Shall day to day and night to night conspire
 To show the goodness of the Almighty Sire
 This mental voice shall man regardless hear
 And never never raise the filial prayr
 Today O hearken nor your folly mourn
 For time mispent that never will return
 But see the sons of vegetation rise
 And spread their leafy banners to the skies
 Allwise Almighty Providence we trace
 In trees and plants and all the flowry race
 As clear as in the nobler frame of man
 All lovely copies of the Makers plan
 The powr the same that forms a ray of light
 That call d creation from eternal night
 Let there be light he said from his profound
 Old Chaos heard and trembled at the sound
 Swift as the word inspird by powr divine
 Behold the light around its Maker shine
 The first fair product of th omnific God
 And now through all his works diffusd abroad
 As reasons powrs by day our God disclose
 So we may trace him in the nights repose
 Say what is sleep and dreams how passing strange
 When action ceases and ideas range
 Licentious and unbounded oer the plains
 Where Fancys queen in giddy triumph reigns
 Hear in soft strains the dreaming lover sigh
 To a kind fair or rave in jealousy
 On pleasure now and now on vengeance bent
 The labring passions struggle for a vent
 What powr O man thy reason then restores
 So long suspended in nocturnal hours
 What secret hand returns the mental train
 And gives improvd thine active powrs again
 From thee O man what gratitude should rise
 And when from balmy sleep thou opst thine eyes
 Let thy first thoughts be praises to the skies
 How merciful our God who thus imparts
 Oerflowing tides of joy to human hearts
 When wants and woes might be our righteous lot
 Our God forgetting by our God forgot
 Among the mental powrs a question rose
 What most the image of th Eternal shows
 When thus to Reason so let Fancy rove
 Her great companion spoke immortal Love
 Say mighty powr how long shall strife prevail
 And with its murmurs load the whispring gale
 Refer the cause to Recollections shrine
 Who loud proclaims my origin divine
 The cause whence heavn and earth began to be
 And is not man immortalizd by me
 Reason let this most causeless strife subside
 Thus Love pronouncd and Reason thus replyd
 Thy birth coelestial queen tis mine to own
 In thee resplendent is the Godhead shown
 Thy words persuade my soul enrapturd feels
 Resistless beauty which thy smile reveals
 Ardent she spoke and kindling at her charms
 She claspd the blooming goddess in her arms
 Infinite Love whereer we turn our eyes
 Appears this evry creatures wants supplies
 This most is heard in Natures constant voice
 This makes the morn and this the eve rejoice
 This bids the fostring rains and dews descend
 To nourish all to serve one genral end
 The good of man yet man ungrateful pays
 But little homage and but little praise
 To him whose works arryd with mercy shine
 What songs should rise how constant how divine



 To a Lady on the Death of three Relations

 WE trace the powr of Death from tomb to tomb
 And his are all the ages yet to come
 Tis his to call the planets from on high
 To blacken Phoebus and dissolve the sky
 His too when all in his dark realms are hurld
 From its firm base to shake the solid world
 His fatal sceptre rules the spacious whole
 And trembling nature rocks from pole to pole
 Awful he moves and wide his wings are spread
 Behold thy brother numberd with the dead
 From bondage freed the exulting spirit flies
 Beyond Olympus and these starry skies
 Lost in our woe for thee blest shade we mourn
 In vain to earth thou never must return
 Thy sisters too fair mourner feel the dart
 Of Death and with fresh torture rend thine heart
 Weep not for them and leave the world behind
 As a young plant by hurricanes up torn
 So near its parent lies the newly born
 But midst the bright ehtereal train behold
 It shines superior on a throne of gold
 Then mourner cease let hope thy tears restrain
 Smile on the tomb and sooth the raging pain
 On yon blest regions fix thy longing view
 Mindless of sublunary scenes below
 Ascend the sacred mount in thought arise
 And seek substantial and immortal joys
 Where hope receives where faith to vision springs
 And rapturd seraphs tune th immortal strings
 To strains extatic Thou the chorus join
 And to thy father tune the praise divine



 To a Clergyman on the Death of his Lady

 WHERE contemplation finds her sacred spring
 Where heavnly music makes the arches ring
 Where virtue reigns unsullyd and divine
 Where wisdom thrond and all the graces shine
 There sits thy spouse amidst the radiant throng
 While praise eternal warbles from her tongue
 There choirs angelic shout her welcome round
 With perfect bliss and peerless glory crownd
 While thy dear mate to flesh no more confind
 Exults a blest an heavnascended mind
 Say in thy breast shall floods of sorrow rise
 Say shall its torrents overwhelm thine eyes
 Amid the seats of heavn a place is free
 And angels open their bright ranks for thee
 For thee they wait and with expectant eye
 Thy spouse leans downward from th empyreal sky
 O come away her longing spirit cries
 And share with me the raptures of the skies
 Our bliss divine to mortals is unknown
 Immortal life and glory are our own
 There too may the dear pledges of our love
 Arrive and taste with us the joys above
 Attune the harp to more than mortal lays
 And join with us the tribute of their praise
 To him who dyd stern justice to stone
 And make eternal glory all our own
 He in his death slew ours and as he rose
 He crushd the dire dominion of our foes
 Vain were their hopes to put the God to flight
 Chain us to hell and bar the gates of light
 She spoke and turnd from mortal scenes her eyes
 Which beamd celestial radiance oer the skies
 Then thou dear man no more with grief retire
 Let grief no longer damp devotions fire
 But rise sublime to equal bliss aspire
 Thy sighs no more be wafted by the wind
 No more complain but be to heavn resignd
 Twas thine t unfold the oracles divine
 To sooth our woes the task was also thine
 Now sorrow is incumbent on thy heart
 Permit the muse a cordial to impart
 Who can to thee their tendrest aid refuse
 To dry thy tears how longs the heavnly muse



 An HYMN to the MORNING

 ATTEND my lays ye ever honourd nine
 Assist my labours and my strains refine
 In smoothest numbers pour the notes along
 For bright Aurora now demands my song
 Aurora hail and all the thousand dies
 Which deck thy progress through the vaulted skies
 The morn awakes and wide extends her rays
 On evry leaf the gentle zephyr plays
 Harmonious lays the featherd race resume
 Dart the bright eye and shake the painted plume
 Ye shady groves your verdant gloom display
 To shield your poet from the burning day
 Calliope awake the sacred lyre
 While thy fair sisters fan the pleasing fire
 The bowrs the gales the variegated skies
 In all their pleasures in my bosom rise
 See in the east th illustrious king of day
 His rising radiance drives the shades away
 But Oh I feel his fervid beams too strong
 And scarce begun concludes th abortive song



 An HYMN to the EVENING

 SOON as the sun forsook the eastern main
 The pealing thunder shook the heavnly plain
 Majestic grandeur From the zephyrs wing
 Exhales the incense of the blooming spring
 Soft purl the streams the birds renew their notes
 And through the air their mingled music floats
 Through all the heavns what beauteous dies are spread
 But the west glories in the deepest red
 So may our breasts with evry virtue glow
 The living temples of our God below
 Filld with the praise of him who gives the light
 And draws the sable curtains of the night
 Let placid slumbers sooth each weary mind
 At morn to wake more heavnly more refind
 So shall the labours of the day begin
 More pure more guarded from the snares of sin
 Nights leaden sceptre seals my drowsy eyes
 Then cease my song till fair Aurora rise



 ISAIAH lxiii 18

 SAY heavnly muse what king or mighty God
 That moves sublime from Idumeas road
 In Bosrahs dies with martial glories joind
 His purple vesture waves upon the wind
 Why thus enrobd delights he to appear
 In the dread image of the Powr of war
 Compresd in wrath the swelling winepress groand
 It bled and pourd the gushing purple round
 Mine was the act th Almighty Saviour said
 And shook the dazzling glories of his head
 When all forsook I trod the press alone
 And conquerd by omnipotence my own
 For mans release sustaind the pondrous load
 For man the wrath of an immortal God
 To execute th Eternals dread command
 My soul I sacrificd with willing hand
 Sinless I stood before the avenging frown
 Atoning thus for vices not my own
 His eye the ample field of battle round
 Surveyd but no created succours found
 His own omnipotence sustaind the right
 His vengeance sunk the haughty foes in night
 Beneath his feet the prostrate troops were spread
 And round him lay the dying and the dead
 Great God what lightning flashes from thine eyes
 What powr withstands if thou indignant rise
 Against thy Zion though her foes may rage
 And all their cunning all their strength engage
 Yet she serenely on thy bosom lies
 Smiles at their arts and all their force defies



 On RECOLLECTION

 MNEME begin Inspire ye sacred nine
 Your ventrous Afric in her great design
 Mneme immortal powr I trace thy spring
 Assist my strains while I thy glories sing
 The acts of long departed years by thee
 Recoverd in due order rangd we see
 Thy powr the longforgotten calls from night
 That sweetly plays before the fancys sight
 Mneme in our nocturnal visions pours
 The ample treasure of her secret stores
 Swift from above the wings her silent flight
 Through Phoebes realms fair regent of the night
 And in her pomp of images displayd
 To the highrapturd poet gives her aid
 Through the unbounded regions of the mind
 Diffusing light celestial and refind
 The heavnly phantom paints the actions done
 By evry tribe beneath the rolling sun
 Mneme enthrond within the human breast
 Has vice condemnd and evry virtue blest
 How sweet the sound when we her plaudit hear
 Sweeter than music to the ravishd ear
 Sweeter than Maros entertaining strains
 Resounding through the groves and hills and plains
 But how is Mneme dreaded by the race
 Who scorn her warnings and despise her grace
 By her unveild each horrid crime appears
 Her awful hand a cup of wormwood bears
 Days years mispent O what a hell of woe
 Hers the worst tortures that our souls can know
 Now eighteen years their destind course have run
 In fast succession round the central sun
 How did the follies of that period pass
 Unnoticd but behold them writ in brass
 In Recollection see them fresh return
 And sure tis mine to be ashamd and mourn
 O Virtue smiling in immortal green
 Do thou exert thy powr and change the scene
 Be thine employ to guide my future days
 And mine to pay the tribute of my praise
 Of Recollection such the powr enthrond
 In evry breast and thus her powr is ownd
 The wretch who dard the vengeance of the skies
 At last awakes in horror and surprise
 By her alarmd he sees impending fate
 He howls in anguish and repents too late
 But O what peace what joys are hers t impart
 To evry holy evry upright heart
 Thrice blest the man who in her sacred shrine
 Feels himself shelterd from the wrath divine



 On IMAGINATION

 THY various works imperial queen we see
 How bright their forms how deckd with pomp
 by thee
 Thy wondrous acts in beauteous order stand
 And all attest how potent is thine hand
 From Helicons refulgent heights attend
 Ye sacred choir and my attempts befriend
 To tell her glories with a faithful tongue
 Ye blooming graces triumph in my song
 Now here now there the roving Fancy flies
 Till some lovd object strikes her wandring eyes
 Whose silken fetters all the senses bind
 And soft captivity involves the mind
 Imagination who can sing thy force
 Or who describe the swiftness of thy course
 Soaring through air to find the bright abode
 Th empyreal palace of the thundring God
 We on thy pinions can surpass the wind
 And leave the rolling universe behind
 From star to star the mental optics rove
 Measure the skies and range the realms above
 There in one view we grasp the mighty whole
 Or with new worlds amaze th unbounded soul
 Though Winter frowns to Fancys rapturd eyes
 The fields may flourish and gay scenes arise
 The frozen deeps may break their iron bands
 And bid their waters murmur oer the sands
 Fair Flora may resume her fragrant reign
 And with her flowry riches deck the plain
 Sylvanus may diffuse his honours round
 And all the forest may with leaves be crownd
 Showrs may descend and dews their gems disclose
 And nectar sparkle on the blooming rose
 Such is thy powr nor are thine orders vain
 O thou the leader of the mental train
 In full perfection all thy works are wrought
 And thine the sceptre oer the realms of thought
 Before thy throne the subjectpassions bow
 Of subjectpassions sovreign ruler thou
 At thy command joy rushes on the heart
 And through the glowing veins the spirits dart
 Fancy might now her silken pinions try
 To rise from earth and sweep th expanse on high
 From Tithons bed now might Aurora rise
 Her cheeks all glowing with celestial dies
 While a pure stream of light oerflows the skies
 The monarch of the day I might behold
 And all the mountains tipt with radiant gold
 But I reluctant leave the pleasing views
 Which Fancy dresses to delight the Muse
 Winter austere forbids me to aspire
 And northern tempests damp the rising fire
 They chill the tides of Fancys flowing sea
 Cease then my song cease the unequal lay



 A Funeral POEM on the Death of C E
 an Infant of Twelve Months

 THROUGH airy roads he wings his instant flight
 To purer regions of celestial light
 Enlargd he sees unnumberd systems roll
 Beneath him sees the universal whole
 Planets on planets run their destind round
 And circling wonders fill the vast profound
 Th ethereal now and now th empyreal skies
 With growing splendors strike his wondring eyes
 The angels view him with delight unknown
 Press his soft hand and seat him on his throne
 Then smilling thus To this divine abode
 The seat of saints of seraphs and of God
 Thrice welcome thou The rapturd babe replies
 Thanks to my God who snatchd me to the skies
 Eer vice triumphant had possessd my heart
 Eer yet the tempter had beguil d my heart
 Eer yet on sins base actions I was bent
 Eer yet I knew temptations dire intent
 Eer yet the lash for horrid crimes I felt
 Eer vanity had led my way to guilt
 But soon arrivd at my celestial goal
 Full glories rush on my expanding soul
 Joyful he spoke exulting cherubs round
 Clapt their glad wings the heavnly vaults resound
 Say parents why this unavailing moan
 Why heave your pensive bosoms with the groan
 To Charles the happy subject of my song
 A brighter world and nobler strains belong
 Say would you tear him from the realms above
 By thoughtless wishes and prepostrous love
 Doth his felicity increase your pain
 Or could you welcome to this world again
 The heir of bliss with a superior air
 Methinks he answers with a smile severe
 Thrones and dominions cannot tempt me there
 But still you cry Can we the sigh forbear
 And still and still must we not pour the tear
 Our only hope more dear than vital breath
 Twelve moons revolvd becomes the prey of death
 Delightful infant nightly visions give
 Thee to our arms and we with joy receive
 We fain would clasp the Phantom to our breast
 The Phantom flies and leaves the soul unblest
 To yon bright regions let your faith ascend
 Prepare to join your dearest infant friend
 In pleasures without measure without end



 To Captain HD of the 65th Regiment

 SAY muse divine can hostile scenes delight
 The warriors bosom in the fields of fight
 Lo here the christian and the hero join
 With mutual grace to form the man divine
 In HD see with pleasure and surprise
 Where valour kindles and where virtue lies
 Go hero brave still grace the post of fame
 And add new glories to thine honourd name
 Still to the field and still to virtue true
 Britannia glories in no son like you



 To the Right Honourable WILLIAM Earl
 of DARTMOUTH His Majestys Principal
 Secretary of State for NorthAmerica c

 HAIL happy day when smiling like the morn
 Fair Freedom rose NewEngland to adorn
 The northern clime beneath her genial ray
 Dartmouth congratulates thy blissful sway
 Elate with hope her race no longer mourns
 Each soul expands each grateful bosom burns
 While in thine hand with pleasure we behold
 The silken reins and Freedoms charms unfold
 Long lost to realms beneath the northern skies
 She shines supreme while hated faction dies
 Soon as appeard the Goddess long desird
 Sick at the view she languishd and expird
 Thus from the splendors of the morning light
 The owl in sadness seeks the caves of night
 No more America in mournful strain
 Of wrongs and grievance unredressd complain
 No longer shalt thou dread the iron chain
 Which wanton Tyranny with lawless hand
 Had made and with it meant t enslave the land
 Should you my lord while you peruse my song
 Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung
 Whence flow these wishes for the common good
 By feeling hearts alone best understood
 I young in life by seeming cruel fate
 Was snatchd from Africs fancyd happy seat
 What pangs excruciating must molest
 What sorrows labour in my parents breast
 Steeld was that soul and by no misery movd
 That from a father seizd his babe belovd
 Such such my case And can I then but pray
 Others may never feel tyrannic sway
 For favours past great Sir our thanks are due
 And thee we ask thy favours to renew
 Since in thy powr as in thy will before
 To sooth the griefs which thou didst once deplore
 May heavnly grace the sacred sanction give
 To all thy works and thou for ever live
 Not only on the wings of fleeting Fame
 Though praise immortal crowns the patriots name
 But to conduct to heavns refulgent fane
 May fiery coursers sweep th ethereal plain
 And bear thee upwards to that blest abode
 Where like the prophet thou shalt find thy God



 O D E T O N E P T U N E

 On Mrs Ws Voyage to England

 I

 WHILE raging tempests shake the shore
 While AElus thunders round us roar
 And sweep impetuous oer the plain
 Be still O tyrant of the main
 Nor let thy brow contracted frowns betray
 While my Susanna skims the watry way

 II

 The Powr propitious hears the lay
 The blueeyd daughters of the sea
 With sweeter cadence glide along
 And Thames responsive joins the song
 Pleasd with their notes Sol sheds benign his ray
 And double radiance decks the face of day

 III

 To court thee to Britannias arms
 Serene the climes and mild the sky
 Her region boasts unnumberd charms
 Thy welcome smiles in evry eye
 Thy promise Neptune keep record my prayr
 Not give my wishes to the empty air

 Boston October 12 1772



 To a LADY on her coming to NorthAmerica
 with her Son for the Recovery of her Health

 INDULGENT muse my grovling mind inspire
 And fill my bosom with celestial fire
 See from Jamaicas fervid shore she moves
 Like the fair mother of the blooming loves
 When from above the Goddess with her hand
 Fans the soft breeze and lights upon the land
 Thus she on Neptunes watry realm reclind
 Appeard and thus invites the lingring wind
 Arise ye winds America explore
 Waft me ye gales from this malignant shore
 The Northern milder climes I long to greet
 There hope that health will my arrival meet
 Soon as she spoke in my ideal view
 The winds assented and the vessel flew
 Madam your spouse bereft of wife and son
 In the groves dark recesses pours his moan
 Each branch widespreading to the ambient sky
 Forgets its verdure and submits to die
 From thence I turn and leave the sultry plain
 And swift pursue thy passage oer the main
 The ship arrives before the favring wind
 And makes the Philadelphian port assignd
 Thence I attend you to Bostonias arms
 Where genrous friendship evry bosom warms
 Thrice welcome here may health revive again
 Bloom on thy cheek and bound in evry vein
 Then back return to gladden evry heart
 And give your spouse his souls far dearer part
 Receivd again with what a sweet surprise
 The tear in transport starting from his eyes
 While his attendant son with blooming grace
 Springs to his fathers ever dear embrace
 With shouts of joy Jamaicas rocks resound
 With shouts of joy the country rings around



 To a LADY on her remarkable Preservation
 in an Hurricane in NorthCarolina

 THOUGH thou didst hear the tempest from afar
 And feltst the horrors of the watry war
 To me unknown yet on this peaceful shore
 Methinks I hear the storm tumultuous roar
 And how stern Boreas with impetuous hand
 Compelld the Nereids to usurp the land
 Reluctant rose the daughters of the main
 And slow ascending glided oer the plain
 Till AEolus in his rapid chariot drove
 In gloomy grandeur from the vault above
 Furious he comes His winged sons obey
 Their frantic sire and madden all the sea
 The billows rave the winds fierce tyrant roars
 And with his thundring terrors shakes the shores
 Broken by waves the vessels frame is rent
 And strows with planks the watry element
 But thee Maria a kind Nereids shield
 Preservd from sinking and thy form upheld
 And sure some heavnly oracle designd
 At that dread crisis to instruct thy mind
 Things of eternal consequence to weigh
 And to thine heart just feelings to convey
 Of things above and of the future doom
 And what the births of the dread world to come
 From tossing seas I welcome thee to land
 Resign her Nereid twas thy Gods command
 Thy spouse late buried as thy fears conceivd
 Again returns thy fears are all relievd
 Thy daughter blooming with superior grace
 Again thou seest again thine arms embrace
 O come and joyful show thy spouse his heir
 And what the blessings of maternal care



 To a LADY and her Children on the Death
 of her Son and their Brother

 OERWHELMING sorrow now demands my song
 From death the overwhelming sorrow sprung
 What flowing tears What hearts with grief opprest
 What sighs on sighs heave the fond parents breast
 The brother weeps the hapless sisters join
 Th increasing woe and swell the crystal brine
 The poor who once his genrous bounty fed
 Droop and bewail their benefactor dead
 In death the friend the kind companion lies
 And in one death what various comfort dies
 Th unhappy mother sees the sanguine rill
 Forget to flow and natures wheels stand still
 But see from earth his spirit far removd
 And know no grief recals your bestbelovd
 He upon pinions swifter than the wind
 Has left mortalitys sad scenes behind
 For joys to this terrestial state unknown
 And glories richer than the monarchs crown
 Of virtues steady course the prize behold
 What blissful wonders to his mind unfold
 But of celestial joys I sing in vain
 Attempt not muse the too adventrous strain
 No more in briny showrs ye friends around
 Or bathe his clay or waste them on the ground
 Still do you weep still wish for his return
 How cruel thus to wish and thus to mourn
 No more for him the streams of sorrow pour
 But haste to join him on the heavnly shore
 On harps of gold to tune immortal lays
 And to your God immortal anthems raise



 To a GENTLEMAN and LADY on the Death
 of the Ladys Brother and Sister and a
 Child of the Name of Avis aged one Year

 ON Deaths domain intent I fix my eyes
 Where human nature in vast ruin lies
 With pensive mind I search the drear abode
 Where the great conquror has his spoils bestowd
 There where the offspring of six thousand years
 In endless numbers to my view appears
 Whole kingdoms in his gloomy den are thrust
 And nations mix with their primeval dust
 Insatiate still he gluts the ample tomb
 His is the present his the age to come
 See here a brother here a sister spread
 And a sweet daughter mingled with the dead
 But Madam let your grief be laid aside
 And let the fountain of your tears be dryd
 In vain they flow to wet the dusty plain
 Your sighs are wafted to the skies in vain
 Your pains they witness but they can no more
 While Death reigns tyrant oer this mortal shore
 The glowing stars and silver queen of light
 At last must perish in the gloom of night
 Resign thy friends to that Almighty hand
 Which gave them life and bow to his command
 Thine Avis give without a murmring heart
 Though half thy soul be fated to depart
 To shining guards consign thine infant care
 To waft triumphant through the seas of air
 Her soul enlargd to heavnly pleasure springs
 She feeds on truth and uncreated things
 Methinks I hear her in the realms above
 And leaning forward with a filial love
 Invite you there to share immortal bliss
 Unknown untasted in a state like this
 With towring hopes and growing grace arise
 And seek beatitude beyond the skies



 On the Death of Dr SAMUEL MARSHALL 1771

 THROUGH thickest glooms look back immortal shade
 On that confusion which thy death has made
 Or from Olympus height look down and see
 A Town involvd in grief bereft of thee
 Thy Lucy sees thee mingle with the dead
 And rends the graceful tresses from her head
 Wild in her woe with grief unknown opprest
 Sigh follows sigh deep heaving from her breast
 Too quickly fled ah whither art thou gone
 Ah lost for ever to thy wife and son
 The hapless child thine only hope and heir
 Clings round his mothers neck and weeps his sorrows there
 The loss of thee on Tylers soul returns
 And Boston for her dear physician mourns
 When sickness calld for Marshalls healing hand
 With what compassion did his soul expand
 In him we found the father and the friend
 In life how lovd how honourd in his end
 And must not then our AEsculapius stay
 To bring his lingring infant into day
 The babe unborn in the dark womb is tost
 And seems in anguish for its father lost
 Gone is Apollo from his house of earth
 But leaves the sweet memorials of his worth
 The common parent whom we all deplore
 From yonder world unseen must come no more
 Yet midst our woes immortal hopes attend
 The spouse the sire the universal friend



 To a GENTLEMAN on his Voyage to GreatBritain
 for the Recovery of his Health

 WHILE others chant of gay Elysian scenes
 Of balmy zephyrs and of flowry plains
 My song more happy speaks a greater name
 Feels higher motives and a nobler flame
 For thee O R the muse attunes her strings
 And mounts sublime above inferior things
 I sing not now of green embowring woods
 I sing not now the daughters of the floods
 I sing not of the storms oer ocean drivn
 And how they howld along the waste of heavn
 But I to R would paint the British shore
 And vast Atlantic not untryd before
 Thy life impaird commands thee to arise
 Leave these bleak regions and inclement skies
 Where chilling winds return the winter past
 And nature shudders at the furious blast
 O thou stupendous earthenclosing main
 Exert thy wonders to the world again
 If ere thy powr prolongd the fleeting breath
 Turnd back the shafts and mockd the gates of death
 If ere thine air dispensd an healing powr
 Or snatchd the victim from the fatal hour
 This equal case demands thine equal care
 And equal wonders may this patient share
 But unavailing frantic is the dream
 To hope thine aid without the aid of him
 Who gave thee birth and taught thee where to flow
 And in thy waves his various blessings show
 May R return to view his native shore
 Replete with vigour not his own before
 Then shall we see with pleasure and surprise
 And own thy work great Ruler of the skies



 To the Rev DR THOMAS AMORY on
 reading his Sermons on DAILY DEVOTION
 in which that Duty is recommended and
 assisted

 TO cultivate in evry noble mind
 Habitual grace and sentiments refind
 Thus while you strive to mend the human heart
 Thus while the heavnly precepts you impart
 O may each bosom catch the sacred fire
 And youthful minds to Virtues throne aspire
 When Gods eternal ways you set in sight
 And Virtue shines in all her native light
 In vain would Vice her works in night conceal
 For Wisdoms eye pervades the sable veil
 Artists may paint the suns effulgent rays
 But Amorys pen the brighter God displays
 While his great works in Amorys pages shine
 And while he proves his essence all divine
 The Atheist sure no more can boast aloud
 Of chance or nature and exclude the God
 As if the clay without the potters aid
 Should rise in various forms and shapes selfmade
 Or worlds above with orb oer orb profound
 Selfmovd could run the everlasting round
 It cannot beunerring Wisdom guides
 With eye propitious and oer all presides
 Still prosper Amory still mayst thou receive
 The warmest blessings which a muse can give
 And when this transitory state is oer
 When kingdoms fall and fleeting Fames no more
 May Amory triumph in immortal fame
 A nobler title and superior name



 On the Death of J C an Infant

 NO more the flowry scenes of pleasure rife
 Nor charming prospects greet the mental eyes
 No more with joy we view that lovely face
 Smiling disportive flushd with evry grace
 The tear of sorrow flows from evry eye
 Groans answer groans and sighs to sighs reply
 What sudden pangs shot thro each aching heart
 When Death thy messenger dispatchd his dart
 Thy dread attendants alldestroying Powr
 Hurried the infant to his mortal hour
 Couldst thou unpitying close those radiant eyes
 Or faild his artless beauties to surprise
 Could not his innocence thy stroke controul
 Thy purpose shake and soften all thy soul
 The blooming babe with shades of Death oerspread
 No more shall smile no more shall raise its head
 But like a branch that from the tree is torn
 Falls prostrate witherd languid and forlorn
 Where flies my James tis thus I seem to hear
 The parent ask Some angel tell me where
 He wings his passage thro the yielding air
 Methinks a cherub bending from the skies
 Observes the question and serene replies
 In heavns high palaces your babe appears
 Prepare to meet him and dismiss your tears
 Shall not th intelligence your grief restrain
 And turn the mournful to the cheerful strain
 Cease your complaints suspend each rising sigh
 Cease to accuse the Ruler of the sky
 Parents no more indulge the falling tear
 Let Faith to heavns refulgent domes repair
 There see your infant like a seraph glow
 What charms celestial in his numbers flow
 Melodious while the foulenchanting strain
 Dwells on his tongue and fills th ethereal plain
 Enoughfor ever cease your murmring breath
 Not as a foe but friend converse with Death
 Since to the port of happiness unknown
 He brought that treasure which you call your own
 The gift of heavn intrusted to your hand
 Cheerful resign at the divine command
 Not at your bar must sovreign Wisdom stand



 An H Y M N to H U M A N I T Y
 To S P G Esq

 I

 LO for this dark terrestrial ball
 Forsakes his azurepaved hall
 A prince of heavnly birth
 Divine Humanity behold
 What wonders rise what charms unfold
 At his descent to earth

 II

 The bosoms of the great and good
 With wonder and delight he viewd
 And fixd his empire there
 Him close compressing to his breast
 The sire of gods and men addressd
 My son my heavnly fair

 III

 Descend to earth there place thy throne
 To succour mans afflicted son
 Each human heart inspire
 To act in bounties unconfind
 Enlarge the close contracted mind
 And fill it with thy fire

 IV

 Quick as the word with swift career
 He wings his course from star to star
 And leaves the bright abode
 The Virtue did his charms impart
 Their G then thy rapturd heart
 Perceivd the rushing God

 V

 For when thy pitying eye did see
 The languid muse in low degree
 Then then at thy desire
 Descended the celestial nine
 Oer me methought they deignd to shine
 And deignd to string my lyre

 VI

 Can Africs muse forgetful prove
 Or can such friendship fail to move
 A tender human heart
 Immortal Friendship laurelcrownd
 The smiling Graces all surround
 With evry heavnly Art



 To the Honourable T H Esq on the Death
 of his Daughter

 WHILE deep you mourn beneath the cypressshade
 The hand of Death and your dear daughter laid
 In dust whose absence gives your tears to flow
 And racks your bosom with incessant woe
 Let Recollection take a tender part
 Assuage the raging tortures of your heart
 Still the wild tempest of tumultuous grief
 And pour the heavnly nectar of relief
 Suspend the sigh dear Sir and check the groan
 Divinely bright your daughters Virtues shone
 How free from scornful pride her gentle mind
 Which neer its aid to indigence declind
 Expanding free it sought the means to prove
 Unfailing charity unbounded love
 She unreluctant flies to see no more
 Her dearlovd parents on earths dusky shore
 Impatient heavns resplendent goal to gain
 She with swift progress cuts the azure plain
 Where grief subsides where changes are no more
 And lifes tumultuous billows cease to roar
 She leaves her earthly mansion for the skies
 Where new creations feast her wondring eyes
 To heavns high mandate cheerfully resignd
 She mounts and leaves the rolling globe behind
 She who late wishd that Leonard might return
 Has ceasd to languish and forgot to mourn
 To the same high empyreal mansions come
 She joins her spouse and smiles upon the tomb
 And thus I hear her from the realms above
 Lo this the kingdom of celestial love
 Could ye fond parents see our present bliss
 How soon would you each sigh each fear dismiss
 Amidst unutterd pleasures whilst I play
 In the fair sunshine of celestial day
 As far as grief affects an happy soul
 So far doth grief my better mind controul
 To see on earth my aged parents mourn
 And secret wish for T to return
 Let brighter scenes your evninghours employ
 Converse with heavn and taste the promisd joy



 NIOBE in Distress for her Children slain by
 APOLLO from Ovids Metamorphoses
 Book VI and from a view of the Painting
 of Mr Richard Wilson

 APOLLOs wrath to man the dreadful spring
 Of ills innumrous tuneful goddess sing
 Thou who didst first th ideal pencil give
 And taughtst the painter in his works to live
 Inspire with glowing energy of thought
 What Wilson painted and what Ovid wrote
 Muse lend thy aid nor let me sue in vain
 Tho last and meanest of the rhyming train
 O guide my pen in lofty strains to show
 The Phrygian queen all beautiful in woe
 Twas where Maeonia spreads her wide domain
 Niobe dwelt and held her potent reign
 See in her hand the regal sceptre shine
 The wealthy heir of Tantalus divine
 He most distinguishd by Dodonean Jove
 To approach the tables of the gods above
 Her grandsire Atlas who with mighty pains
 Th ethereal axis on his neck sustains
 Her other grandsire on the throne on high
 Rolls the loudpealing thunder thro the sky
 Her spouse Amphion who from Jove too springs
 Divinely taught to sweep the sounding strings
 Seven sprightly sons the royal bed adorn
 Seven daughters beauteous as the opning morn
 As when Aurora fills the ravishd sight
 And decks the orient realms with rosy light
 From their bright eyes the living splendors play
 Nor can beholders bear the flashing ray
 Wherever Niobe thou turnst thine eyes
 New beauties kindle and new joys arise
 But thou hadst far the happier mother provd
 If this fair offspring had been less belovd
 What if their charms exceed Auroras teint
 No words could tell them and no pencil paint
 Thy love too vehement hastens to destroy
 Each blooming maid and each celestial boy
 Now Manto comes endud with mighty skill
 The past to explore the future to reveal
 Thro Thebes wide streets Tiresias daughter came
 Divine Latonas mandate to proclaim
 The Theban maids to hear the orders ran
 When thus Maeonias prophetess began
 Go Thebans great Latonas will obey
 And pious tribute at her altars pay
 With rights divine the goddess be implord
 Nor be her sacred offspring unadord
 Thus Manto spoke The Theban maids obey
 And pious tribute to the goddess pay
 The rich perfumes ascend in waving spires
 And altars blaze with consecrated fires
 The fair assembly moves with graceful air
 And leaves of laurel bind the flowing hair
 Niobe comes with all her royal race
 With charms unnumberd and superior grace
 Her Phrygian garments of delightful hue
 Inwove with gold refulgent to the view
 Beyond description beautiful she moves
 Like heavnly Venus midst her smiles and loves
 She views around the supplicating train
 And shakes her graceful head with stern disdain
 Proudly she turns around her lofty eyes
 And thus reviles celestial deities
 What madness drives the Theban ladies fair
 To give their incense to surrounding air
 Say why this new sprung deity preferrd
 Why vainly fancy your petitions heard
 Or say why Caeus offspring is obeyd
 While to my goddesship no tributes paid
 For me no altars blaze with living fires
 No bullock bleeds no frankincense transpires
 Tho Cadmus palace not unknown to fame
 And Phrygian nations all revere my name
 Whereer I turn my eyes vast wealth I find
 Lo here an empress with a goddess joind
 What shall a Titaness be deifyd
 To whom the spacious earth a couch denyd
 Nor heavn nor earth nor sea receivd your queen
 Till pitying Delos took the wandrer in
 Round me what a large progeny is spread
 No frowns of fortune has my soul to dread
 What if indignant she decrease my train
 More than Latonas number will remain
 Then hence ye Theban dames hence haste away
 Nor longer offrings to Latona pay
 Regard the orders of Amphions spouse
 And take the leaves of laurel from your brows
 Niobe spoke The Theban maids obeyd
 Their brows unbound and left the rights unpaid
 The angry goddess heard then silence broke
 On Cynthus summit and indignant spoke
 Phoebus behold thy mother in disgrace
 Who to no goddess yields the prior place
 Except to Junos self who reigns above
 The spouse and sister of the thundring Jove
 Niobe sprung from Tantalus inspires
 Each Theban bosom with rebellious fires
 No reason her imperious temper quells
 But all her father in her tongue rebels
 Wrap her own sons for her blaspheming breath
 Apollo wrap them in the shades of death
 Latona ceasd and ardent thus replies
 The God whose glory decks th expanded skies
 Cease thy complaints mine be the task assignd
 To punish pride and scourge the rebel mind
 This Phoebe joindThey wing their instant flight
 Thebes trembled as th immortal powrs alight
 With clouds incompassd glorious Phoebus stands
 The featherd vengeance quivring in his hands
 Near Cadmus walls a plain extended lay
 Where Thebes young princes passd in sport the day
 There the bold coursers bounded oer the plains
 While their great masters held the golden reins
 Ismenus first the racing pastime led
 And ruld the fury of his flying steed
 Ah me he sudden cries with shrieking breath
 While in his breast he feels the shaft of death
 He drops the bridle on his coursers mane
 Before his eyes in shadows swims the plain
 He the firstborn of great Amphions bed
 Was struck the first first mingled with the dead
 Then didst thou Sipylus the language hear
 Of fate portentous whistling in the air
 As when th impending storm the sailor sees
 He spreads his canvas to the favring breeze
 So to thine horse thou gavst the golden reins
 Gavst him to rush impetuous oer the plains
 But ah a fatal shaft from Phoebus hand
 Smites thro thy neck and sinks thee on the sand
 Two other brothers were at wrestling found
 And in their pastime claspt each other round
 A shaft that instant from Apollos hand
 Transfixt them both and stretcht them on the sand
 Together they their cruel fate bemoand
 Together languishd and together groand
 Together too th unbodied spirits fled
 And sought the gloomy mansions of the dead
 Alphenor saw and trembling at the view
 Beat his torn breast that changd its snowy hue
 He flies to raise them in a kind embrace
 A brothers fondness triumphs in his face
 Alphenor fails in this fraternal deed
 A dart dispatchd him so the fates decreed
 Soon as the arrow left the deadly wound
 His issuing entrails smoakd upon the ground
 What woes on blooming Damasichon wait
 His sighs portend his near impending fate
 Just where the wellmade leg begins to be
 And the soft sinews form the supple knee
 The youth sore wounded by the Delian god
 Attempts t extract the crimeavenging rod
 But whilst he strives the will of fate t avert
 Divine Apollo sends a second dart
 Swift thro his throat the featherd mischief flies
 Bereft of sense he drops his head and dies
 Young Ilioneus the last directs his prayr
 And cries My life ye gods celestial spare
 Apollo heard and pity touchd his heart
 But ah too late for he had sent the dart
 Thou too O Ilioneus art doomd to fall
 The fates refuse that arrow to recal
 On the swift wings of ever flying Fame
 To Cadmus palace soon the tidings came
 Niobe heard and with indignant eyes
 She thus expressd her anger and surprise
 Why is such privilege to them allowd
 Why thus insulted by the Delian god
 Dwells there such mischief in the powrs above
 Why sleeps the vengeance of immortal Jove
 For now Amphion too with grief oppressd
 Had plungd the deadly dagger in his breast
 Niobe now less haughty than before
 With lofty head directs her steps no more
 She who late told her pedigree divine
 And drove the Thebans from Latonas shrine
 How strangely changdyet beautiful in woe
 She weeps nor weeps unpityd by the foe
 On each pale corse the wretched mother spread
 Lay overwhelmd with grief and kissd her dead
 Then raisd her arms and thus in accents slow
 Be sated cruel Goddess with my woe
 If Ive offended let these streaming eyes
 And let this sevnfold funeral suffice
 Ah take this wretched life you deignd to save
 With them I too am carried to the grave
 Rejoice triumphant my victorious foe
 But show the cause from whence your triumphs flow
 Tho I unhappy mourn these children slain
 Yet greater numbers to my lot remain
 She ceasd the bow string twangd with awful sound
 Which struck with terror all th assembly round
 Except the queen who stood unmovd alone
 By her distresses more presumptuous grown
 Near the pale corses stood their sisters fair
 In sable vestures and dishevelld hair
 One while she draws the fatal shaft away
 Faints falls and sickens at the light of day
 To sooth her mother lo another flies
 And blames the fury of inclement skies
 And while her words a filial pity show
 Struck dumbindignant seeks the shades below
 Now from the fatal place another flies
 Falls in her flight and languishes and dies
 Another on her sister drops in death
 A fifth in trembling terrors yields her breath
 While the sixth seeks some gloomy cave in vain
 Struck with the rest and mingled with the slain
 One only daughter lives and she the least
 The queen close claspd the daughter to her breast
 Ye heavnly powrs ah spare me one she cryd
 Ah spare me one the vocal hills replyd
 In vain she begs the Fates her suit deny
 In her embrace she sees her daughter die
  The queen of all her family bereft
 Without or husband son or daughter left
 Grew stupid at the shock The passing air
 Made no impression on her stiffning hair

  This Verse to the End is the Work of another Hand

 The blood forsook her face amidst the flood
 Pourd from her cheeks quite fixd her eyeballs
 stood
 Her tongue her palate both obdurate grew
 Her curdled veins no longer motion knew
 The use of neck and arms and feet was gone
 And evn her bowels hardned into stone
 A marble statue now the queen appears
 But from the marble steal the silent tears



 To S M a young African Painter on seeing his Works

 TO show the labring bosoms deep intent
 And thought in living characters to paint
 When first thy pencil did those beauties give
 And breathing figures learnt from thee to live
 How did those prospects give my soul delight
 A new creation rushing on my sight
 Still wondrous youth each noble path pursue
 On deathless glories fix thine ardent view
 Still may the painters and the poets fire
 To aid thy pencil and thy verse conspire
 And may the charms of each seraphic theme
 Conduct thy footsteps to immortal fame
 High to the blissful wonders of the skies
 Elate thy soul and raise thy wishful eyes
 Thrice happy when exalted to survey
 That splendid city crownd with endless day
 Whose twice six gates on radiant hinges ring
 Celestial Salem blooms in endless spring
 Calm and serene thy moments glide along
 And may the muse inspire each future song
 Still with the sweets of contemplation blessd
 May peace with balmy wings your soul invest
 But when these shades of time are chasd away
 And darkness ends in everlasting day
 On what seraphic pinions shall we move
 And view the landscapes in the realms above
 There shall thy tongue in heavnly murmurs flow
 And there my muse with heavnly transport glow
 No more to tell of Damons tender sighs
 Or rising radiance of Auroras eyes
 For nobler themes demand a nobler strain
 And purer language on th ethereal plain
 Cease gentle muse the solemn gloom of night
 Now seals the fair creation from my sight



 To his Honour the LieutenantGovernor on
 the Death of his Lady March 24 1773

 ALLConquering Death by thy resistless powr
 Hopes towring plumage falls to rise no more
 Of scenes terrestrial how the glories fly
 Forget their splendors and submit to die
 Who ere escapd thee but the saint  of old
 Beyond the flood in sacred annals told
 And the great sage  whom fiery coursers drew
 To heavns bright portals from Elishas view
 Wondring he gazd at the refulgent car
 Then snatchd the mantle floating on the air
 From Death these only could exemption boast
 And without dying gaind th immortal coast
 Not falling millions sate the tyrants mind
 Nor can the victors progress be confind
 But cease thy strife with Death fond Nature cease
 He leads the virtuous to the realms of peace

  Enoch  Elijah

 His to conduct to the immortal plains
 Where heavns Supreme in bliss and glory reigns
 There sits illustrious Sir thy beauteous spouse
 A gemblazd circle beaming on her brows
 Haild with acclaim among the heavnly choirs
 Her soul newkindling with seraphic fires
 To notes divine she tunes the vocal strings
 While heavns high concave with the music rings
 Virtues rewards can mortal pencil paint
 Noall descriptive arts and eloquence are faint
 Nor canst thou Oliver assent refuse
 To heavnly tidings from the Afric muse
 As soon may change thy laws eternal fate
 As the saint miss the glories I relate
 Or her Benevolence forgotten lie
 Which wipd the trickling tear from Misrys eye
 Wheneer the adverse winds were known to blow
 When loss to loss  ensud and woe to woe
 Calm and serene beneath her fathers hand
 She sat resignd to the divine command
 No longer then great Sir her death deplore
 And let us hear the mournful sigh no more
 Restrain the sorrow streaming from thine eye
 Be all thy future moments crownd with joy
 Nor let thy wishes be to earth confind
 But soaring high pursue th unbodied mind
 Forgive the muse forgive th adventrous lays
 That fain thy soul to heavnly scenes would raise



 A Farewel to AMERICA To Mrs S W

 I

 ADIEU NewEnglands smiling meads
 Adieu the flowry plain
 I leave thine opning charms O spring
 And tempt the roaring main

 II

 In vain for me the flowrets rise
 And boast their gaudy pride
 While here beneath the northern skies
 I mourn for health denyd

 III

 Celestial maid of rosy hue
 O let me feel thy reign
 I languish till thy face I view
 Thy vanishd joys regain

 IV

 Susanna mourns nor can I bear
 To see the crystal showr
 Or mark the tender falling tear
 At sad departures hour

 V

 Not unregarding can I see
 Her soul with grief opprest
 But let no sighs no groans for me
 Steal from her pensive breast

 VI

 In vain the featherd warblers sing
 In vain the garden blooms
 And on the bosom of the spring
 Breathes out her sweet perfumes

 VII

 While for Britannias distant shore
 We sweep the liquid plain
 And with astonishd eyes explore
 The wideextended main

 VIII

 Lo Health appears celestial dame
 Complacent and serene
 With Hebes mantle oer her Frame
 With souldelighting mein

 IX

 To mark the vale where London lies
 With misty vapours crownd
 Which cloud Auroras thousand dyes
 And veil her charms around

 X

 Why Phoebus moves thy car so slow
 So slow thy rising ray
 Give us the famous town to view
 Thou glorious king of day


 XI

 For thee Britannia I resign
 NewEnglands smiling fields
 To view again her charms divine
 What joy the prospect yields

 XII

 But thou Temptation hence away
 With all thy fatal train
 Nor once seduce my soul away
 By thine enchanting strain

 XIII

 Thrice happy they whose heavnly shield
 Secures their souls from harms
 And fell Temptation on the field
 Of all its powr disarms

 Boston May 7 1773



 A REBUS by I B

 I

 A BIRD delicious to the taste
 On which an army once did feast
 Sent by an hand unseen
 A creature of the horned race
 Which Britains royal standards grace
 A gem of vivid green

 II

 A town of gaiety and sport
 Where beaux and beauteous nymphs resort
 And gallantry doth reign
 A Dardan hero famd of old
 For youth and beauty as were told
 And by a monarch slain

 III

 A peer of popular applause
 Who doth our violated laws
 And grievances proclaim
 Th initials show a vanquishd town
 That adds fresh glory and renown
 To old Britannias fame


 An ANSWER to the Rebus by the Author of these POEMS

 THE poet asks and Phillis cant refuse
 To show th obedience of the Infant muse
 She knows the Quail of most inviting taste
 Fed Israels army in the dreary waste
 And whats on Britains royal standard borne
 But the tall graceful rampant Unicorn
 The Emerald with a vivid verdure glows
 Among the gems which regal crowns compose
 Bostons a town polite and debonair
 To which the beaux and beauteous nymphs repair
 Each Helen strikes the mind with sweet surprise
 While living lightning flashes from her eyes
 See young Euphorbus of the Dardan line
 By Manelaus hand to death resign
 The well known peer of popular applause
 Is Cm zealous to support our laws
 Quebec now vanquishd must obey
 She too much annual tribute pay
 To Britain of immortal fame
 And add new glory to her name
