CHAPTER 1 A DESERT MEETING

An automobile shot out from a gash in the hills and slipped swiftly down
to the butte Here it came to a halt on the white dusty road while
its occupant gazed with eager unsated eyes on the great panorama that
stretched before her The earth rolled in waves like a mighty sea to
the distant horizon line From a wonderful blue sky poured down upon
the land a bath of sunbeat The air was like wine pure and strong and
above the desert swam the rare untempered light of Wyoming Surely here
was a peace primeval a silence unbroken since the birth of creation

It was all new to her and wonderfully exhilarating The infinite roll
of plain the distant shining mountains the multitudinous voices of the
desert drowned in a sunlit sea of spacethey were all details of the
situation that ministered to a large serenity

And while she breathed deeply the satisfaction of it an exploding rifle
echo shattered the stillness With excited sputtering came the prompt
answer of a fusillade She was new to the West but some instinct
stronger than reason told the girl that here was no playful puncher
shooting up the scenery to ventilate his exuberance Her imagination
conceived something more deadly a sinister picture of men pumping lead
in a grim closelipped silence a lusty plainsman with murder in
his heart crumpling into a lifeless heap while the thin smokespiral
curled from his hot rifle

So the girl imagined the scene as she ran swiftly forward through the
pines to the edge of the butte bluff whence she might look down upon the
coulee that nestled against it Nor had she greatly erred for her first
sweeping glance showed her the thing she had dreaded

In a semicircle well back from the foot of the butte half a dozen
men crouched in the cover of the sagebrush and a scattered group of
cottonwoods They were perhaps fifty yards apart and the attention
of all of them was focused on a spot directly beneath her Even as she
looked in that first swift moment of apprehension a spurt of smoke
came from one of the rifles and was flung back from the forked pine
at the bottom of the mesa She saw him then kneeling behind his
insufficient shelter a trapped man making his last stand

From where she stood the girl distinguished him very clearly and under
the fieldglasses that she turned on him the details leaped to life
Tall strong slender with the lean clean build of a greyhound he
seemed as wary and alert as a panther The broad soft hat the scarlet
handkerchief loosely knotted about his throat the gray shirt spurs
and overalls proclaimed him a stockman just as his dead horse at the
entrance to the coulee told of an accidental meeting in the desert and a
hurried run for cover

That he had no chance was quite plain but no plainer than the cool
vigilance with which he proposed to make them pay Even in the matter
of defense he was worse off than they were but he knew how to make
the most of what he had knew how to avail himself of every inch of
sagebrush that helped to render him indistinct to their eyes

One of the attackers eager for a clearer shot exposed himself a trifle
too far in taking aim Without any loss of time in sighting swift as a
lightningflash the rifle behind the forked pine spoke That the bullet
reached its mark she saw with a gasp of dismay For the man suddenly
huddled down and rolled over on his side

His comrades appeared to take warning by this example The men at both
ends of the crescent fell back and for a minute the girls heart leaped
with the hope that they were about to abandon the siege Apparently the
man in the scarlet kerchief had no such expectation He deserted his
position behind the pine and ran back crouching low in the brush to
another little clump of trees closer to the bluff The reason for this
was at first not apparent to her but she understood presently when the
men who had fallen back behind the rolling hillocks appeared again well
in to the edge of the bluff Only by his timely retreat had the man
saved himself from being outflanked

It was very plain that the attackers meant to take their time to finish
him in perfect safety He was surrounded on every side by a cordon of
rifles except where the bare face of the butte hung down behind him
To attempt to scale it would have been to expose himself as a mark for
every gun to certain death

It was now that she heard the man who seemed to be directing the attack
call out to another on his right She was too far to make out the words
but their effect was clear to her He pointed to the brow of the butte
above and a puncher in white woolen chaps dropped back out of range
and swung to the saddle upon one of the ponies bunched in the rear He
cantered round in a wide circle and made for the butte His purpose was
obviously to catch their victim in the unprotected rear and fire down
upon him from above

The young woman shouted a warning but her voice failed to carry For a
moment she stood with her hands pressed together in despair then
turned and swiftly scudded to her machine She sprang in swept forward
reached the rim of the mesa and plunged down Never before had she
attempted so precarious a descent in such wild haste The car fairly
leaped into space and after it struck swayed dizzily as it shot down
The girl hung on her face white and set the pulse in her temple
beating wildly She could do nothing as the machine rocked down but
hope against many chances that instant destruction might be averted

Utterly beyond her control the motorcar thundered down reached the
foot of the butte and swept over a little hill in its wild flight She
rushed by a mounted horseman in the thousandth part of a second She was
still speeding at a tremendous velocity but a second hill reduced this
somewhat She had not yet recovered control of the machine but though
her eyes instinctively followed the white road that flashed past she
again had photographed on her brain the scene of the turbid tragedy in
which she was intervening

At the foot of the butte the road circled and dipped into the coulee
She braced herself for the shock but though the wheels skidded till
her heart was in her throat the automobile hanging on the balance of
disaster swept round in safety

Her horn screamed an instant warning to the trapped man She could not
see him and for an instant her heart sank with the fear that they
had killed him But she saw then that they were still firing and she
continued her honking invitation as the car leaped forward into the zone
of spitting bullets

By this time she was recovering control of the motor and she dared
not let her attention wander but out of the corner of her eye she
appreciated the situation Temporarily out of sheer amaze at this
apparition from the blue the guns ceased their sniping She became
aware that a light curly head crouched low in the sagebrush was
moving rapidly to meet her at right angles and in doing so was
approaching directly the line of fire She could see him dodging to and
fro as he moved forward for the rifles were again barking

She was within two hundred yards of him still going rapidly but not
with the same headlong rush as before when the curly head disappeared
in the sagebrush It was up again presently but she could see that the
man came limping and so uncertainly that twice he pitched forward to
the ground Incautiously one of his assailants ran forward with a shout
the second time his head went down Crack The unerring rifle rang out
and the impetuous one dropped in his tracks

As she approached the young woman slowed without stopping and as the
car swept past Curly Head flung himself in headlong He picked himself
up from her feet crept past her to the seat beyond and almost
instantly whipped his rifle to his shoulder in prompt defiance of the
fire that was now converged on them

Yet in a few moments the sound died away for a voice midway in the
crescent had shouted an amazed discovery

By God its a woman

The car skimmed forward over the uneven ground toward the end of the
semicircle and passed within fifty yards of the second man from the
end the one she had picked out as the leader of the party He was a
black swarthy fellow in plain leather chaps and blue shirt As they
passed he took a long steady aim

Duck shouted the man beside her and dragged her down on the seat so
that his body covered hers

A puff of wind fanned the girls cheek

Near thing her companion said coolly He looked back at the swarthy
man and laughed softly Some day youll mebbe wish you had sent your
pills straighter Mr Judd Morgan

Yet a few wheelturns and they had dipped forward out of range among
the great land waves that seemed to stretch before them forever The
unexpected had happened and she had achieved a rescue in the face of
the impossible

Hurt badly the girl inquired briefly her darkblue eyes meeting his
as frankly as those of a boy

No need for an undertaker I reckon Ill survive maam

Where are you hit

I just got a telegram from my ankle saying there was a cargo of lead
arrived there unexpected he drawled easily

Hurts a good deal doesnt it

No more than is needful to keep my memory jogged up Its a sort of a
forgetmenot souvenir For a good boy compliments of Mr Jim Henson
he explained

Her dark glance swept him searchingly She disapproved the assurance
of his manner even while the youth in her applauded his reckless
sufficiency His gay courage held her unconsenting admiration even while
she resented it He was a trifle too much at his ease for one who had
just been snatched from dire peril Yet even in his insouciance there
was something engaging something almost of distinction

What was the trouble

Mirth bubbled in his gray eyes I gathered maam that they wanted to
collect my scalp

Do what she frowned

Bump me offsend me across the divide

Oh I know that But why

He seemed to reproach himself Now how could I be so neglectful I
clean forgot to ask

Thats ridiculous was her sharp verdict

Yes maam plumb ridiculous My only excuse is that they began
scattering lead so sudden I didnt have time to ask many Whyfors I
reckon well just have to call it a Wyoming difference of opinion he
concluded pleasantly

Which means I suppose that you are not going to tell me

I got so much else to tell yu thats a heap more important he
laughed Yu see Im enjoyin my first automobile ride It was
certainly thoughtful of yu to ask me to go riding with yu Miss
Messiter

So you know my name May I ask how was her astonished question

He gave the low laugh that always seemed to suggest a private source of
amusement of his own I suspicioned that might be your name when I say
yu come asailin down from heaven to gather me up like Enoch

Why

Well maam I happened to drift in to Gimlet Butte two or three days
ago and while I was up at the depot looking for some freight a train
sashaid in and side tracked a flat car There was an automobile on that
car addressed to Miss Helen Messiter Now automobiles are awful seldom
in this country I dont seem to remember having seen one before

I see Youre quite a Sherlock Holmes Do you know anything more about
me

I know yu have just fallen heir to the Lazy D They say yu are a
schoolmarm but I dont believe it

Well I am Then Why dont you believe it she added

He surveyed her with his smile audacious let his amused eyes wander
down from the mobile face with the wildrose bloom to the slim young
figure so long and supple then serenely met her frown

Yu dont look it

No Are you the owner of a composite photograph of the teachers of the
country

He enjoyed again his private mirth I should like right well to have
the pictures of some of them

She glanced at him sharply but he was gazing so innocently at the
purple Shoshones in the distance that she could not give him the snub
she thought he needed

You are right My name is Helen Messiter she said by way of
stimulating a counter fund of information For though she was a young
woman not much given to curiosity she was aware of an interest in this
spare broadshouldered youth who was such an incarnation of bronzed
vigor

Glad to meet yu Miss Messiter he responded and offered his firm
brown hand in Western fashion

But she observed resentfully that he did not mention his own name It
was impossible to suppose that he knew no better and she was driven
to conclude that he was silent of set purpose Very well If he did not
want to introduce himself she was not going to urge it upon him In a
businesslike manner she gave her attention to eating up the dusty miles

Yes maam I reckon I never was more glad to death to meet a lady than
I was to meet up with yu he continued cheerily Yu sure looked
good to me as yu come afoggin down the road I fair had been yearnin
for company but was some discouraged for fear the invitation had
miscarried He broke off his sardonic raillery and let his level gaze
possess her for a long moment Miss Messiter Im certainly under
an obligation to yu I cant repay Yu saved my life he finished
gravely

Nonsense

Fact

It isnt a personal matter at all she assured him with a touch of
impatient hauteur

It s a heap personal to me

In spite of her healthy young resentment she laughed at the way in which
he drawled this out and with a swift sweep her boyish eyes took in
again his compelling devilmaycare charm She was a tenderfoot but
intuition as well as experience taught her that he was unusual enough to
be one of ten thousand No young Greek gods head could have risen
more superbly above the bricktanned column of the neck than this
closecropped curly one Gray eyes deep and unwavering and masterful
looked out of a face as brown as Wyoming He was got up with no thought
of effect but the tigerish litheness the picturesque competency of
him spake louder than costuming

Arent you really hurt worse than you pretend Im sure your ankle
ought to be attended to as soon as possible

Dont tell me youre a lady doctor maam he burlesqued his alarm

Can you tell me where the nearest ranch house is she asked ignoring
his diversion

The Lazy D is the nearest I reckon

Which direction

North by east maam

Then Ill take the most direct road to it

In that case Ill thank yu for my ride and get out here

Butwhy

He waved a jaunty hand toward the recent battlefield The Lazy D lies
right back of that hill I expect mebbe those wolves might howl again
if we went back

Where then shall I take you

I hate to trouble yu to go out of your way

I dare say but Im going just the same she told him dryly

If youre right determined He interrupted himself to point to the
south Do yu see that camelback peak over there

The one with the sunshine on its lower edge

Thats it Miss Messiter They call those two humps the Antelope Peaks
If yu can drop me somewhere near there I think Ill manage all right

Im not going to leave you till we reach a house she informed him
promptly Youre not fit to walk fifty yards

Thats right kind of yu but I could not think of asking so much My
friends will find me if yu leave me where I can work a heliograph

Or your enemies she cut in

I hope not Id not likely have the luck to get another invitation
right then to go riding with a friendly young lady

She gave him direct cool blackblue eyes that met and searched his
Im not at all sure she is friendly I shall want to find out the cause
of the trouble you have just had before I make up my mind as to that

I judge people by their actions Yu didnt wait to find out before
bringing the ambulance into action he laughed

I see you do not mean to tell me

Youre quite a lawyer maam he evaded

I find you a very slippery witness then

Ask anything yu like and Ill tell you

Very well Who were those men and why were they trying to kill you

They turned their wolf loose on me because I shot up one of them
yesterday

Dear me Is it your business to go around shooting people Thats three
I happen to know that you have shot How many more

No more maamnot recently

Well three is quite enoughrecently she mimicked You seem to me a
good deal of a desperado

Yes maam

Dont say Yes maam like that as if it didnt matter in the least
whether you are or not she ordered

No maam

Oh She broke off with a gesture of impatience at his burlesque of
obedience You know what I meanthat you ought to deny it ought to be
furious at me for suggesting it

Ought I

Of course you ought

Theres a heap of ways I aint up to specifications he admitted
cheerfully

And who are theythe men that were attacking you

There was a gleam of irrepressible humor in the bold eyes Your
cowpunchers maam

My cowpunchers

They cetainly belong to the Lazy D outfit

And you say that you shot one of my men yesterday He could see her
getting ready for a declaration of war

Down by Willow CreekYes maam he answered comfortably

And why may I ask she flamed

Thats a long story Miss Messiter It wouldnt be square for me to get
my version in before your boys Yu ask them He permitted himself a
genial smile somewhat ironic I shouldnt wonder but what theyll give
me a giltedged testimonial as an unhanged horse thief

Isnt there such a thing as law in Wyoming the girl demanded

Lots of it Yu can buy just as good law right here as in Kalamazoo

I wish I knew where to find it

Like to put me in the calaboose

In the penitentiary Yes sir A moment later the question that was in
her thoughts leaped hotly from her lips Who are you sir that dare to
commit murder and boast of it

She had flicked him on the raw at last Something that was near to pain
rested for a second in his eyes Murder is a hard name maam And I
didnt say he was daid or any of the three came his gentle answer

You MEANT to kill them anyhow

Did I There was the ghost of a sad smile about his eyes

The way you act a person might think you one of Ned Bannisters men
she told him scornfully

I expect youre right

She repented her a little at a charge so unjust If you are not ashamed
of your name why are you so loath to part with it

Yu didnt ask me my name he said a dark flush sweeping his face

I ask it now

Like the light from a snuffed candle the boyish recklessness had gone
out of his face His jaws were set like a vise and he looked hard as
hammered steel

My name is Bannister he said coldly

Ned Bannister the outlaw she let slip and was aware of a strange
sinking of the heart

It seemed to her that something sinister came to the surface in his
handsome face I reckon we might as well let it go at that he
returned with bitter briefness



CHAPTER 2 THE KING OF THE BIG HORN COUNTRY

Two months before this time Helen Messiter had been serenely teaching a
second grade at Kalamazoo Michigan notwithstanding the earnest efforts
of several youths of that city to induce her to retire to domesticity
Whats the use of being a schoolmarm had been the burden of their
plaint Any spinster can teach kids CAT Cat but only one in
several thousand can be the prettiest bride in Kalamazoo None of them
however had been able to drive the point sufficiently home and it
is probable that she would have continued to devote herself to Young
America if an uncle she had never seen had not died without a will and
left her a ranch in Wyoming yclept the Lazy D

When her lawyer proposed to put the ranch on the market Miss Helen had a
word to say

I think not Ill go out and see it first anyhow she said

But really my dear young lady it isnt at all necessary Fact is
Ive already had an offer of a hundred thousand dollars for it Now I
should judge that a fair price

Very likely his client interrupted quietly But you see I dont
care to sell

Then what in the world are you going to do with it

Run it

But my dear Miss Messiter it isnt an automobile or any other kind of
toy You must remember that it takes a business head and a great deal of
experience to make such an investment pay I really think

My school ends on the fourteenth of June Ill get a substitute for the
last two months I shall start for Wyoming on the eighteenth of April

The man of law gasped explained the difficulties again carefully as to
a child found that he was wasting his breath and wisely gave it up

Miss Messiter had started on the eighteenth of April as she had
announced When she reached Gimlet Butte the nearest railroad point
to the Lazy D she found a group of curious weatherbeaten individuals
gathered round a machine foreign to their experience It was on a flat
car and the general opinion ran the gamut from a newfangled sewing
machine to a thresher Into this guessing contest came its owner with
so brisk and businesslike an energy that inside of two hours she was
testing it up and down the wide street of Gimlet Butte to the wonder
and delight of an audience to which each one of the eleven saloons of
the city had contributed its admiring quota

Meanwhile the young woman attended strictly to business She had
disappeared for half an hour with a suit case into the Elk House
and when she returned in a shortskirted corduroy suit leggings and
widebrimmed gray Stetson hat all Gimlet Butte took an absorbing
interest in the details of this delightful adventure that had happened
to the town The population was out _en masse_ to watch her slip down
the road on a trial trip

Presently Soapy Sothern drifting in on his buckskin from the Hoodoo
Peak country where for private reasons of his own he had been for the
past month a sojourner reported that he had seen the prettiest sight
in the State climbing under a gasoline bronc with a monkeywrench in
her hand Where Right over the hill on the edge of town The immediate
stampede for the cow ponies was averted by a warning chugchug that
sounded down the road followed by the appearance of a flashing whir
that made the ponies dance on their hind legs

The gasoline bronc lady sure makes a hit with me announced Texas
gravely I allow Ill rustle a job with the Lazy D outfit

She cetainly rides herd on that machine like a champeen admitted
Soapy I reckon Ill drift over to the Lazy D with you to look after
yore remains Tex when the lightning hits you

Miss Messiter swung the automobile round in a swift circle came to an
abrupt halt in front of the hotel and alighted without delay As she
passed in through the half score of admirers she had won her dark eyes
swept smilingly over assembled Cattleland She had already met most of
them at the launching of the machine from the flat car and had directed
their perspiring energies as they labored to follow her orders Now she
nodded a recognition with a little ripple of gay laughter

Im delighted to be able to contribute to the entertainment of Gimlet
Butte she said as she swept in For this young woman was possessed
of Western adaptation It gave her no conscientious qualms to exchange
conversation fraternal with these genial savages

The Elk House did not rejoice in a private dining room and competition
strenuous ensued as to who should have the pleasure of sitting beside
the guest of honor To avoid ill feeling the matter was determined by
a game of freezeout in which Texas and a mature gentleman named
from his complexion Beet Collins were the lucky victors Texas
immediately repaired to the general store where he purchased a new
scarlet bandanna for the occasion also a cake of soap with which to
rout the alkali dust that had filtered into every pore of his hands and
face from a long ride across the desert

Came supper and Texas simultaneously the cowpunchers face scrubbed
to an apple shine At the last moment Collins defaulted his nerve
completely gone Since however he was a thrifty soul he sold his
place to Soapy for ten dollars and proceeded to invest the proceeds in
an immediate drunk

During the first ten minutes of supper Miss Messiter did not appear and
the two guardians who flanked her chair solicitously were the object of
much badinage

She got one glimpse of that red haid of Tex and the pore ladys took to
the sage explained Yorky

And him scrubbed so shiny fust time since Christmas before the big
blizzard sighed Doc Rogers

Shucks She aint scared of no sawedoff hammereddown runt like
Texas No siree Miss Messiters on the absent list cause shes afraid
she caynt resist the blandishments of Soapy Did yo ever hear about
Soapy and that Caspar hash slinger

Forget it Slim advised Soapy promptly He had been engaged in lofty
and oblivious conversation with Texas but he did not intend to allow
reminiscences to get under way just now

At this opportune juncture arrived the mistress of the gasoline bronc
neatly clad in a simple white lawn with blue trimmings She looked like
a gleam of sunshine in her fresh sweet youth and not even in her own
school room had she ever found herself the focus of a cleaner more
unstinted admiration For the outdoors West takes off its hat reverently
to women worthy of respect especially when they are young and friendly

Helen Messiter had come to Wyoming because the call of adventure the
desire for experience outside of rutted convention were stirring her
warmblooded youth She had seen enough of life lived in a parlor and
when there came knocking at her door a chance to know the big untamed
outdoors at first hand she had at once embraced it like a lover She
was eager for her new life and she set out skillfully to make these
men tell her what she wanted to know To them of course it was an old
story and whatever of romance it held was unconscious But since she
wanted to talk of the West they were more than ready to please her

So she listened and drew them out with adroit questions when it was
necessary She made them talk of life on the open range of rustlers and
those who lived outside the law in the upper Shoshone country of the
deadly war waging between the cattle and sheep industries

Are there any sheep near the Lazy D ranch she asked intensely
interested in Soapys tale of how cattle and sheep could no more be got
to mix than oil and water

For an instant nobody answered her question then Soapy replied with
what seemed elaborate carelessness

Ned Bannister runs a bunch of about twelve thousand not moren fifteen
or twenty miles from your place

And you say they are spoiling the range

Theyre cetainly spoiling it for cows

But cant something be done If my cows were there first I dont see
what right he has to bring his sheep there the girl frowned

The assembled company attended strictly to supper The girl surprised
at the stillness looked round Well

Now youre shouting maam Thats what we say enthused Texas
spurring to the rescue

It doesnt much matter what you say What do you do asked Helen
impatiently Do you lie down and let Mr Bannister and his kind drive
their sheep over you

Do we Soapy grinned Texas Yet it seemed to her his smile was not
quite carefree

Im not a cowman myself explained Soapy to the girl Nor do I run
sheep I

Tell Miss Messiter what yore business is Soapy advised Yorky from
the end of the table with a mouthful of biscuit swelling his cheeks

Soapy crushed the irrepressible Yorky with a look but that young man
hit back smilingly

Soapy he sells soap maam Hes a sorter city salesman I reckon

I should never have guessed it Mr Sothern does not LOOK like
a salesman said the girl with a glance at his shrewd hard
expressionless face

Yes maam hes a firstclass seller of soap is Mr Sothern
chuckled the cowpuncher kicking his friends gayly under the table

You can see I never sold HIM any Miss Messiter came back Soapy
sorrowfully

All this was Greek to the young lady from Kalamazoo How was she to know
that Mr Sothern had vended his soap in small cubes on street corners
and that he wrapped bank notes of various denominations in the bars
which same were retailed to eager customers for the small sum of fifty
cents after a guarantee that the soap was good His customers rarely
patronized him twice and frequently they used bad language because
the soap wrapping was not as valuable as they had expected This was
manifestly unfair for Mr Sothern who made no claims to philanthropy
often warned them that the soap should be bought on its merits and not
with an eye single to the premium that might or might not accompany the
package

I started to tell you maam when that infant interrupted that
the cowmen dont aim to quit business yet a while Theyve drawn a
deadline Miss Messiter

A deadline

Yes maam beyond which no sheep herder is to run his bunch

And if he does the girl asked open eyed

He dont do it twict maam Why dont you pass the fritters to Miss
Messiter Slim

And about this Bannister Who is he

Her innocent question seemed to ring a bell for silence seemed to carry
with it some hidden portent that stopped idle conversation as a striking
clock that marks the hour of an execution

The smile that had been gay grew grim and men forgot the subject of
their light casual talk It was Sothern that answered her and
she observed that his voice was grave his face studiously without
expression

Mr Bannister maam is a sheepman

So I understood but Her eyes traveled swiftly round the table and
appraised the sudden sense of responsibility that had fallen on these
reckless careless frontiersmen I am wondering what else he is
Really he seems to be the bogey man of Gimlet Butte

There was another instant silence and again it was Soapy that lifted
it I expaict youll like Wyoming Miss Messiter leastways I hope you
will Theres a right smart of country here His gaze went out of the
open door to the vast sea of space that swam in the fine sunset light
Yes most folks that aint plumb spoilt with city ways likes it

Sure shell like it Yu want to get a good easyriding hawss Miss
Messiter advised Slim

And a rifle added Texas promptly

It occurred to her that they were all working together to drift the
conversation back to a safe topic She followed the lead given her
but she made up her mind to know what it was about her neighbor
Mr Bannister the sheep herder that needed to be handled with such
wariness and circumspection of speech

Her chance came half an hour later when she stood talking to the
landlady on the hotel porch in the mellow twilight that seemed to rest
on the land like a moonlit aura For the moment they were alone

What is it about this man Bannister that makes men afraid to speak of
him she demanded with swift impulse

Her landladys startled eyes went alertly round to see that they were
alone Hush child You mustnt speak of him like that warned the
older woman

Why mustnt I Thats what I want to know

Is isnt healthy

What do you mean

Again that anxious look flashed round in the dusk The Bannister outfit
is the worst in the land Ned Bannister is king of the whole Big Horn
country and beyond that to the Tetons

And you mean to tell me that everybody is afraid of himthat men like
Mr Sothern dare not say their soul is their own the newcomer asked
contemptuously

Not so loud child He has spies everywhere Thats the trouble You
dont know who is in with him Hes got the whole region terrified

Is he so bad

He is a devil Last year he and his hell riders swept down on Topaz and
killed two bartenders just to see them kick Ned Bannister said Folks
allow they knew too much

But the lawthe Government Havent you a sheriff and officers

Bannister has He elects the sheriff in this county

Arent there more honest people here than villains

Ten times as many but the trouble is that the honest folks cant trust
each other You see if one of them made a mistake and confided in the
wrong manwell some fine day he would go riding herd and would not
turn up at night Next week or next month maybe one of his partners
might find a pile of bones in an arroyo

Have you ever seen this Bannister

You MUST speak lower when you talk of him Miss Messiter the woman
insisted Yes I saw him once at least I think I did Mighty few folks
know for sure that they have seen him He is a mystery and he travels
under many names and disguises

When was it you think you saw him

Two years ago at Ayr The bank was looted that night and robbed of
thirty thousand dollars They roused the cashier from his bed and made
him give the combination He didnt want to and Ned Bannisterher
voice sank to a tremulous whisperput redhot runningirons between
his fingers till he weakened It was a moonlight nightmuch such a
night as thisand after it was done I peeped through the blind of my
room and saw them ride away He rode in front of them and sang like an
angeldid it out of daredeviltry to mock the people of the town that
hadnt nerve enough to shoot him You see he knew that nobody would
dare hurt him count of the revenge of his men

What was he like the mistress of the Lazy D asked strangely awed at
this recital of transcendent villainy

Course he was masked and I didnt see his face But Id know him
anywhere Hes a long slim fellow built like a mountain lion You
couldnt look at him and ever forget him Hes one of these graceful
easy men that go so fur with fool women one of the kind that half shuts
his dark devil eyes and masters them without seeming to try

So hes a woman killer too is he Any more outstanding
inconsistencies in this versatile Jesse James

Hes plumb crazy about music they say Has a piano and plays Grigg and
Chopping and all that classical kind of music He went clear down to
Denver last year to hear Mrs Shoeman sing

Helen smiled guessing at SchumannHeink as the singer in question and
Grieg and Chopin as the composers named Her interest was incredibly
aroused She had expected the West and its products to exhilarate her
but she had not looked to find so finished a Mephisto among its vaunted
bad men He was probably overrated considered a wonder because his
accomplishments outstepped those of the range But Helen Messiter had
quite determined on one thing She was going to meet this redoubtable
villain and make up her mind for herself Already before she had been
in Wyoming six hours this emancipated young woman had decided on that



CHAPTER 3 AN INVITATION GIVEN AND ACCEPTED

And already she had met him Not only met him but saved him from the
just vengeance about to fall upon him She had not yet seen her own
ranch had not spoken to a single one of her employees for it had
been a part of her plan to drop in unexpected and examine the situation
before her foreman had a chance to put his best foot forward So she
had started alone from Gimlet Butte that morning in her machine and had
come almost in sight of the Lazy D ranch houses when the battle in the
coulee invited her to take a hand

She had acted on generous impulse and the unforeseen result had been to
save this desperado from justice But the worst of it was that she could
not find it in her heart to regret it Granted that he was a villain
doubledyed and beyond hope yet he was the home of such courage such
virility that her unconsenting admiration went out in spite of herself
He was at any rate a MAN squarejawed resolute implacable In the
sinuous trail of his life might lie arson robbery murder but he still
held to that dynamic spark of selfrespect that is akin to the divine
Nor was it possible to believe that those unblinking gray eyes with
the capability of a latent sadness of despair in them expressed a soul
entirely without nobility He had a certain gallant ease a certain
attractive candor that did not consist with villainy unadulterated

It was characteristic even of her impulsiveness that Helen Messiter
curbed the swift condemnation that leaped to her lips when she knew
that the man sitting beside her was the notorious bandit of the Shoshone
fastnesses She was not in the least afraid A sure instinct told her he
was not the kind of a man of whom a woman need have fear so long as
her own anchor held fast In good time she meant to let him have
her unvarnished opinion of him but she did not mean it to be an
unconsidered one Wherefore she drove the machine forward toward the
camelbacked peak he had indicated her eyes straight before her a frown
corrugating her forehead

For him having made his dramatic announcement he seemed content for
the present with silence He leaned back in the car and appreciated her
with a coolness that just missed impudence Certainly her appearance
proclaimed her very much worth while To dwell on the long lines of her
supple young body the exquisite throat and chin curve was a pleasure
with a thrill to it As a physical creation a mere innocent young
animal he thought her perfect attuned to a fine harmony of grace
and color But it was the animating vitality of her the lightness of
motion the fire and sparkle of expression that gave her the captivating
charm she possessed

They were two miles nearer the camelbacked peak before he broke the
silence

Beats a bronco for getting over the ground Think Ill have to get
one he mused aloud

With the money you took from the Ayr bank she flashed

I might drive off some of your cows and sell them he countered
promptly About how much will they hold me up for a machine like this

This is only a runabout You can get one for twelve or fourteen hundred
dollars of anybodys money

Of yours he laughed

I havent that much with me If youll come over and hold up the ranch
perhaps we might raise it among us she jeered

His mirth was genuine But right now I couldnt get more than how much
off yu

Sixtythree dollars is all I have with me and I couldnt give you
moreNOT EVEN IF YOU PUT RED HOT IRONS BETWEEN MY FINGERS She gave it
to him straight her blue eyes fixed steadily on him

Yet she was not prepared for the effect of her words The last thing she
had expected was to see the blood wash out of his bronzed face to see
his sensitive nostrils twitch with pain He made her feel as if she had
insulted him as if she had been needlessly cruel And because of it she
hardened her heart Why should she spare him the mention of it He had
not hesitated at the shameless deed itself Why should she shrink before
that wounded look that leaped to his fine eyes in that flash of time
before he hardened them to steel

You did itdidnt you she demanded

Thats what they say His gaze met her defiantly

And it is true isnt it

Oh anything is true of a man that herds sheep he returned bitterly

If that is true it would not be possible for you to understand how much
I despise you

Thank you he retorted ironically

I dont understand at all I dont see how you can be the man they
say you are Before I met you it was easy to understand But somehowI
dont knowyou dont LOOK like a villain She found herself strangely
voicing the deep hope of her heart It was surely impossible to look at
him and believe him guilty of the things of which he was accused And
yet he offered no denial suggested no defense

Her troubled eyes went over his thin sunbaked face with its touch
of bitterness and she did not find it possible to dismiss the subject
without giving him a chance to set himself right

You cant be as bad as they say You are not are you she asked
naively

What do yu think he responded coolly

She flushed angrily at what she accepted as his insolence A man of any
decency would have jumped at the chance to explain

But if there is nothing to explain

You are then guilty

Their eyes met and neither of them quailed

If I pleaded not guilty would yu believe me

She hesitated I dont know How could I when it is known by everybody
And yet

He smiled Why should I trouble yu then with explanations I reckon
well let it go at guilty

Is that all you can say for yourself

He seemed to hang in doubt an instant then shook his head and refused
the opening

I expect if we changed the subject I could say a good deal for yu he
drawled I never saw anything pluckier than the way yu flew down from
the mesa and conducted the cuttingout expedition Yu sure drilled
through your punchers like a streak of lightning

I didnt know who you were she explained proudly

Would it have made any difference if yu had

Again the angry flush touched her cheeks Not a bit I would have saved
you in order to have you properly hanged later she cut back promptly

He shook his head gayly Im cetainly going to disappoint yu some
Your enterprising punchers may collect me yet but not alive I reckon

Ill give them strict orders to bring you in alive

Did you ever want the moon when yu was a little kid he asked

Well see Mr Outlaw Bannister

He laughed softly in the quiet indolent fashion that would have been
pleasant if it had not been at her Its right kind of you to take so
much interest in me Id most be willing to oblige by letting your boys
rope me to renew this acquaintance maam Then I get out here Miss
Messiter he added

She stopped on the instant Plainly she could not get rid of him too
soon Havent you forgot one thing she asked ironically

Yes maam To thank you proper for what yu did for me He limped
gingerly down from the car and stood with his hand on one of the tires
I have been trying to think how to say it right but I guess Ill have
to give it up All is that if I ever get a chance to even the score

She waved his thanks aside impatiently I didnt mean that You have
forgotten to take my purse

His gravity was broken on the instant and his laughter was certainly
delightfully fresh I clean forgot but I expect Ill drop over to the
ranch for it some day

Well try to make to make you welcome Mr Bannister

Dont put yourself out at all Ill take potluck when I come

How many of you may we expect she asked defiantly

Oh I allow to come alone

Youll very likely forget

No maam I dont know so many ladies that Im liable to such an
oversight

I have heard a different story But if you do remember to come
and will let us know when you expect to honor the Lazy D Ill have
messengers sent to meet you

He perfectly understood her to mean leaden ones and the humorous gleam
in his eye sparkled in appreciation of her spirit I dont want all
that fuss made over me I reckon Ill drop in unexpected he said

She nodded curtly Goodbye Hope your ankle wont trouble you very
much

Thank yu maam I reckon it wont Goodbye Miss Messiter

Out of the tail of her eye she saw him bowing like an Italian opera
singer as impudently insouciant as gracefully graceless as any stage
villain in her memory Once again she saw him when her machine swept
round a curve and she could look back without seeming to do so limping
across through the sage brush toward a little hillock near the road And
as she looked the bare curly head was inclined toward her in another
low mocking bow He was certainly the gallantest vagabond unhanged



CHAPTER 4 AT THE LAZY D RANCH

Helen Messiter was a young woman very much alive which implies that she
was given to emotions and as her machine skimmed over the ground to
the Lazy D she had them to spare For from the first this young man had
taken her eye and it had come upon her with a distinct shock that he
was the notorious scoundrel who was terrorizing the countryside She
told herself almost passionately that she would never have believed it
if he had not said so himself She knew quite well that the coldness
that had clutched her heart when he gave his name had had nothing to do
with fear There had been chagrin disappointment but nothing in the
least like the terror she might have expected The simple truth was that
he had seemed so much a man that it had hurt her to find him also a wild
beast

Deep in her heart she resented the conviction forced upon her Reckless
he undoubtedly was at odds with the law surely but it was hard to
admit that attractive personality to be the mask of fiendish cruelty
and sinister malice And yetthe facts spoke for themselves He had not
even attempted a denial Still there was a mystery about him else how
was it possible for two so distinct personalities to dwell together in
the same body

She hated him with all her lusty young will not only for what he was
but also for what she had been disappointed in not finding him after her
first instinctive liking Yet it was with an odd little thrill that
she ran down again into the coulee where her prosaic life had found its
first real adventure He might be all they said but nothing could wipe
out the facts that she had offered her life to save his and that he
had lent her his body as a living shield for one exhilarating moment of
danger

As she reached the hill summit beyond the coulee Helen Messiter
was aware that a rider in ungainly chaps of white wool was rapidly
approaching He dipped down into the next depression without seeing her
and when they came face to face at the top of the rise the result was
instantaneous His pony did an animated twostep not on the programme
It took one glance at the diabolical machine and went up on its hind
legs preliminary to giving an elaborate exhibition of pitching The
rider indulged in vivid profanity and plied his quirt vigorously But
the bronco with the fear of this unknown evil on its soul varied its
bucking so effectively that the puncher astride its hurricane deck was
forced in the language of his kind to take the dust

His red head sailed through the air and landed in the white sand at
the girls feet For a moment he sat in the road and gazed with chagrin
after the vanishing heels of his mount Then his wrathful eyes came
round to the owner of the machine that had caused the eruption His
mouth had opened to give adequate expression to his feelings when he
discovered anew the forgotten fact that he was dealing with a woman
His jaw hung open for an instant in amaze and when he remembered the
unedited vocabulary he had turned loose on the world a flood of purple
swept his tanned face

She wanted to laugh but wisely refrained Im very sorry was what
she said

He stared in silence as he slowly picked himself from the ground His
red hair rose like the quills of a porcupine above a face that had the
appearance of being unfinished Neither nose nor mouth nor chin seemed
to be quite definite enough

She choked down her gayety and offered renewed apologies

I was going for a doc he explained by way of opening his share of
the conversation

Then perhaps you had better jump in with me and ride back to the Lazy
D I suppose thats where you came from

He scratched his vivid head helplessly Yes maam

Then jump in

I was going to Bear Creek maam he added dubiously

How far is it

Bout twentyfive miles and then some

You dont expect to walk do you

No I allowed

Ill take you back to the ranch where you can get another horse

I reckon maam Id ruther walk

Nonsense Why

I aint used to them gas wagons

Its quite safe There is nothing to be afraid of

Reluctantly he got in beside her as happy as a calf in a branding pen

Are you the lady that sashaid off with Ned Bannister he asked
presently after he had had time to smother successively some of his
fear wonder and delight at their smooth swift progress

Yes Why

The boys allow you hadnt oughter have done it Then to place the
responsibility properly on shoulders broader than his own he added
Thats what Judd says

And who is Judd

Judd hes the foreman of the Lazy D

Below them appeared the corrals and houses of a ranch nestling in a
little valley flanked by hills

This yeres the Lazy D announced the youth with pride and in the
spirit of friendliness suggested a caution Judd hes some peppery
You wanter smooth him down some seeing as hes riled up today

A flicker of steel came into the blue eyes Indeed Well here we are

If it aint Reddy AND the lady with the flying machine murmured a
freckled youth named McWilliams emerging from the bunkhouse with a pan
of water which had been used to bathe the wound of one of the punctured
combatants

Whats that snapped a voice from within and immediately its owner
appeared in the doorway and bored with narrowed black eyes the young
woman in the machine

Who are you he demanded brusquely

Your target she answered quietly Would you like to take another
shot at me

The freckled lad broke out into a gurgle of laughter at which the
black swarthy man beside him wheeled round in a rage What you
cacklin at Mac he demanded in a low voice

Oh the things I notice returned that youth jauntily meeting the
others anger without the flicker of an eyelid

It aint healthy to be so noticin insinuated the other

Yu dont say came the prompt sarcastic retort If youre such a
darned good judge of health yu better be attending to some of your
patients He jerked a casual thumb over his shoulder toward the bunks
on which lay the wounded men

I shouldnt wonder but what there might be another patient for me to
attend to snarled the foreman

That so Well turn your wolf loose when yu get to feelin real
devilish jeered the undismayed one strolling forward to assist Miss
Messiter to alight

The mistress of the Lazy D had been aware of the byplay but she had
caught neither the words nor their import She took the offered brown
hand smilingly for here again she looked into the frank eyes of the
West unafraid and steady She judged him not more than twentytwo
but the school where he had learned of life had held open and strenuous
session every day since he could remember

Glad to meet yu maam he assured her in the current phrase of the
semiarid lands

Im sure I am glad to meet YOU she answered heartily Can you tell
me where is the foreman of the Lazy D

He introduced with a smile the swarthy man in the doorway This is him
maamMr Judd Morgan

Now it happened that Mr Judd Morgan was simmering with suppressed
spleen

All Ive got to say is that you had no business mixing up in that
shootin affair back there Perhaps you dont know that the man you
saved is Ned Bannister the outlaw was his surly greeting

Oh yes I know that

Then what dye meanWho are you anyway His insolent eyes coasted
malevolently over her

Helen Messiter is my name

It was ludicrous to see the change that came over the man He had been
prepared to bully her and with a word she had pricked the bubble of his
arrogance He swallowed his anger and got a mechanical smile in working
order

Glad to see you here Miss Messiter he said his sinister gaze
attempting to meet hers frankly I been looking for you every day

But yu managed to surprise him after all maam chuckled Mac

Wheres yo hawss Reddy inquired a tall young man who had appeared
silently in the doorway of the bunkhouse

Reddy pinked violently I had an accident Denver he explained This
lady yere she

Scooped yu right off yore hawss Yu dont say sympathized Mac so
breathlessly that even Reddy joined in the chorus of laughter that went
up at his expense

The young woman thought to make it easy for him and suggested an
explanation

His horse isnt used to automobiles and so when it met this one

I got off interposed Reddy hastily displaying a complexion like a
boiled beet

He got off Mac explained gravely to the increasing audience

Denver nodded with an imperturbable face He got off

Mac introduced Miss Messiter to such of her employees as were on hand
Shake hands with Miss Messiter Missou was the formula the name
alone varying to suit the embarrassed gentlemen in leathers Each of
them in turn presented a huge hand in which her little one disappeared
for the time and was sawed up and down in the air like a pumphandle
Yet if she was amused she did not show it and her pleasure at meeting
the simple elemental products of the plains outweighed a great deal her
sense of the ludicrous

How are your patients getting along she presently asked of her
foreman

I reckon all right I sent Reddy for a doc but

He got off murmured Mac pensively

Ill go rope another hawss put in the man who had got off

Get a jump on you then Miss Messiter would you like to look over the
place

Not now I want to see the men that were hurt Perhaps I can help them
Once I took a few weeks in nursing

Bully for you maam whooped Mac Ive a notion those boys are
sufferin for a woman to put the diamondhitch on them bandages

Bring that suitcase in she commanded Denver in the gentlest voice
he had ever heard after she had made a hasty inspection of the first
wounded man

From the suitcase she took a little leather medicinecase the kind
that can be bought already prepared for use It held among other things
a roll of medicated cotton some antiseptic tablets and a little steel
instrument for probing

Some warm water please and have some boiling on the range were her
next commands

Mac flew to execute them

It was a pleasure to see her work so deftly the skillful hands
accomplished what her brain told them In admiring awe the punchers
stood awkwardly around while she washed and dressed the hurts Two of
the bullets had gone through the fleshy part of the arm and left clean
wounds In the case of the third man she had to probe for the lead but
fortunately found it with little difficulty Meanwhile she soothed the
victim with gentle womanly sympathy

I know it hurts a good deal Just a minute and Ill be through

His hands clutched tightly the edges of his bunk Thats all right
doc You attend to roping that pill and Ill endure the grief

A long sigh of relief went up from the assembled cowboys when she drew
the bullet out

The sinewy hands fastened on the wooden bunk relaxed suddenly

Friscos daid gasped the cook who bore the title of Wun Hop for
no reason except that he was an Irishman in a place formerly held by a
Chinese

He has only fainted she said quietly and continued with the
antiseptic dressing

When it was all over the big tanned men gathered at the entrance to
the calf corral and expanded in admiration of their new boss

Shes a pure for fair She grades up any old way yuh take her to
the best cornfed article on the market pronounced Denver with
enthusiasm

I got to ride the boundary sighed Missou I kinder hate to go right
now

Here too acquiesced another I got a roundup on Wind Creek to cut
out them twoyearolds If twas my sayso Id order Mac on that job

Right kind of yu Seems to meMacs sarcastic eye trailed around to
include all those who had been singing her praisesthe new queen of
this hacienda wont have no trouble at all picking a prince consort when
she gets round to it Heres Wun Hop not what yu might call anxious
but cetainly willing Then Denvers some in the turtledove business
according to that hashslinger in Cheyenne Missou might be induced to
accept if it was offered him proper and I allow Jim aint turned the
color of Redtops hair jest for instance I dont want to leave out
Frisco and the other boys carrying Bannisters pills

Nor McWilliams Id admire to include him murmured Denver

That sunburned nonchalant youth laughed musically Sure thing Id
hate to be left out The only difference is

Well

His roving eye circled blandly round I stand about one show in a
million Yu roughnecks are dead ones already

With which cold comfort he sauntered away to join Miss Messiter and
the foreman who now appeared together at the door of the ranchhouse
prepared to make a tour of the buildings and the immediate corrals

Isnt there a woman on the place she was asking Morgan

Nom there aint Hendersons daughter would come and stay with yu a
while I reckon

Please send for her at once then and ask her to come today

All right Ill send one of the boys right away

How did yu leave Frisco maam asked Mac by way of including
himself easily

Hes resting quietly Unless bloodpoisoning sets in they ought all to
do well

Its right lucky for them yu happened along This is the hawss corral
maam explained the young man just as Morgan opened his thin lips to
tell her

Judd contrived to get rid of him promptly Slap on a saddle Mac and
run up the remuda so Miss Messiter can see the hawsses for herself he
ordered

Mebbe shed rather ride down and look at the bunch suggested the
capable McWilliams

As it chanced she did prefer to ride down the pasture and look over
the place from on horseback She was in love with her ranch already
Its spacious distances the thousands of cattle and the horses these
picturesque retainers who served her even to the shedding of an enemys
blood they all struck an answering echo in her gallant young heart
that nothing in Kalamazoo had been able to stir She bubbled over with
enthusiasm the while Morgan covertly sneered and McWilliams warmed to
the untamed youth in her

What about this man Bannister she flung out suddenly after they had
cantered back to the house when the remuda had been inspected

Her abrupt question brought again the short tense silence she had
become used to expect

He runs sheep about twenty or thirty miles southwest of here
explained McWilliams in a carefully casual tone

So everybody tells me but it seems to me he spills a good deal of lead
on my men she answered impatiently Whats the trouble

Last week he crossed the deadline with a bunch of five thousand
sheep

Who draws this deadline

The cattlemen got together and drew it Your uncle was one of those
that marked it off maam

And Bannister crossed it

Yes maam Yesterday Frisco come on him and one of his herders with
a big bunch of them less than fifteen miles from here He didnt know it
was Bannister and took a potshot at him Course Bannister came back
at him and he got Frisco in the laig

Didnt know it was Bannister What difference WOULD that make she
said impatiently

Mac laughed What difference would it make Judd

Morgan scowled and the young man answered his own question We dont
any of us go out of our way moren a mile to cross Bannisters trail
he drawled

Do you wear this for an ornament Are you upholstered with hardware to
catch the eyes of some girl she asked touching with the end of her
whip the revolver in the holster strapped to his chaps

His serene gay smile flashed at her Are yu ordering me to go out and
get Ned Bannisters scalp

No I am not she explained promptly What I am trying to discover is
why you all seem to be afraid of one man He is only a man isnt he

A veil of ice seemed to fall over the boyish face and leave it chiseled
marble His unspeaking eyes rested on the swarthy foreman as he
answered

I dont know what he is maam He may be one man or he may be a
hundred Whats more I aint particularly suffering to find out Fact
is I havent lost any Bannisters

The girl became aware that her foreman was looking at her with a wary
silent vigilance sinister in its intensity

In short youre like the rest of the people in this section Youre
afraid

Now yure shoutin Miss Messiter I sure am when it comes to shootin
off my mouth about Bannister

And you Mr Morgan

It struck her that the young puncher waited with a curious interest for
the answer of the foreman

Did it look like I was afraid this mawnin maam he asked with
narrowed eyes

No you all seemed brave enough then when you had him eight to one

I wasnt there hastily put in McWilliams I dont go gunning for my
man without giving him a show

I do retorted Morgan cruelly Id go if we was fifty to one Wed
a got him too if it hadnt been for Miss Messiter Twas a chance we
aint likely to get again for a year

It wasnt your fault you didnt kill him Mr Morgan she said
looking hard at him You may be interested to know that your last shot
missed him only about six inches and me about four

I didnt know who you were he sullenly defended

I see You only shoot at women when you dont know who they are She
turned her back on him pointedly and addressed herself to McWilliams
You can tell the men working on this ranch that I wont have any more
such attacks on this man Bannister I dont care what or who he is I
dont propose to have him murdered by my employees Let the law take him
and hang him Do you hear

I cetainly do and the boys will get the word straight he replied

I take it since yuh are giving your orders through Mac yuh dont need
me any longer for your foreman bullied Morgan

You take it right sir came her crisp reply McWilliams will be my
foreman from today

The mans face malignant and wolfish suddenly lost its mask That she
would so promptly call his bluff was the last thing he had expected
Thats all right I reckon yuh think yuh know your own business but
Ill put it to yuh straight Long as yuh live youll be sorry for this

And with that he wheeled away

She turned to her new foreman and found him less radiant than she could
have desired Im right sorry yu did that Im afraid yull make
trouble for yourself he said quietly

Why

I dont know myself just why He hesitated before adding They say
him and Bannister is thicker than theyd ought to be Its a cinch that
hes in cahoots somehow with that Shoshone bunch of bad men

Butwhy thats ridiculous Only this morning he was trying to kill
Bannister himself

Thats what I dont just savvy Theres a whole lot about that business
I dont get next to I guess Bannister is at the head of them
Everybody seems agreed about that But the whole thing is a tangle of
contradiction to me Ive milled it over a heap in my mind too

What are some of the contradictions

Well heres one right off the bat as we used to say back in the
States Bannister is a great musician they claim fine singer and
all that Now I happen to know he cant sing any more than a bellowing
yearling

How do you know she asked her eyes shining with interest

Because I heard him try it Twas one day last summer when I was out
cutting trail of a bunch of strays down by Dead Cow Creek The day was
hot and I lay down behind a cottonwood and dropped off to sleep When
I awakened it didnt take me longern an hour to discover what had woke
me Somebody on the other side of the creek was trying to sing It was
cetainly the limit Pretty soon he come out of the brush and I seen it
was Bannister

Youre sure it was Bannister

If seeing is believing Im sure

And was his singing really so bad

Id hate ever to hear worse

Was he singing when you saw him

No hed just quit He caught sight of my pony grazing and hunted
cover real prompt

Then it might have been another man singing in the thicket

It might but it wasnt Yu see Id followed him through the bush by
his song and he showed up the moment I expected him

Still there might have been another man there singing

One chance in a million he conceded

A sudden hope flamed up like tow in her heart Perhaps after all Ned
Bannister was not the leader of the outlaws Perhaps somebody else was
masquerading in his name using Bannisters unpopularity as a shield to
cover his iniquities Still this was an unlikely hypothesis she had to
admit For why should he allow his good name to be dragged in the dust
without any effort to save it On a sudden impulse the girl confided her
doubt to McWilliams

You dont suppose there can be any mistake do you Somehow I cant
think him as bad as they say He looks awfully reckless but one feels
one could trust his face

Same here agreed the new foreman First off when I saw him my think
was Id like to have that man backing my play when Im sitting in the
game with Old Man Hard Luck reaching out for my blue chips

You dont think faces lie do you

Ive seen them that did but genrally speaking tongues are a heap
likelier to get tangled with the truth But I reckon there aint any
doubt about Bannister Hes known over all this Western country

The young woman sighed Im afraid youre right



CHAPTER 5 THE DANCE AT FRASERS

Heard tell yet of the dance over to Frasers

He was a young man of a brick red countenance and he wore loosely round
his neck the best polka dot silk handkerchief that could be bought in
Gimlet Butte also such gala attire as was usually reserved only for
events of importance Sitting his horse carelessly in the plainsmans
indolent fashion he asked his question of McWilliams in front of the
Lazy D bunkhouse

Nope When does the shindig come off

Friday night Big thing Yu want to be there All yu lads

Mebbe some of us will ride over

He of the polka dot kerchief did not appear quite satisfied His glance
wandered toward the house as it had been doing occasionally since the
moment of his arrival

Yu bet this dance is ace high Mac Fancy costumes and masks Yu can
rent the costumes over to Slausons for three per Texas hes going to
call the dances Music from Gimlet Butte Yu want to get it tucked away
in your thinker that this dance aint on the order of culls No sirree
its cornfed

Glad to hear of it Ill cipher out somehow to be there Slim

Slims glance took in the ranchhouse again He had ridden twentythree
miles out of his way to catch a glimpse of the newly arrived mistress of
the Lazy D the report of whose good looks and adventures had traveled
hand in hand through many canons even to the heart of the Tetons It had
been on Skunk Creek that he had heard of her three days before and now
he had come to verify the tongue of rumor to see her quite casually of
course and do his own appraising It began to look as if he were going
to have to ride off without a glimpse of her

He nodded toward the house turning a shade more purple than his native
choleric hue Yu want to bring your boss with yu Mac We been
hearing a right smart lot about her and the boys would admire to
have her present Its going to be strictly according to Hoyleno
roughhouse plays go yunderstand

Ill speak to her about it Macs deep amusement did not reach the
surface He was quite well aware that Slim was playing for time and that
he was too bashful to plump out the desire that was in him Great the
way cows are jumpin aint it

Sure Well Ill be movin along to Slausons I just drapped in on my
way Thought mebbe yu hadnt heard tell of the dance

Much obliged Was it for old man Slauson yu dug up all them togs
Slim Hell cetainly admire to see yu in that silk tablecloth yu got
round your neck

Slims purple deepened again Yu go to grass Mac I dont aim to ask
yu to be my valley yet awhile

Crect I was just wondering do all the Triangle Bar boys ride the
range so handsome

Dont yu worry about the Triangle Bar boys advised the embarrassed
Slim gathering up his bridle reins

With one more reluctant glance in the direction of the house he rode
away When he reached the corral he looked back again His gaze showed
him the boyish foreman doubled up with laughter also the sweep of a
white skirt descending from the piazza

Now aint that hoodooed luck the aggrieved rider of the Triangle Bar
outfit demanded of himself I made my getaway about three shakes too
soon by gum

Her foreman was in the throes of mirth when Helen Messiter reached him

Include me in the joke she suggested

Oh I was just thinkin he explained inadequately

Does it always take you that way

About these boys that drop in so frequent on business these days Funny
how fond theyre getting of the Lazy D There was that stock detective
happened in yesterday to show how anxious he was about your cows Then
the two Willow Creek riders that wanted a job punching for yu not to
mention mention the Shoshone miner and the storekeeper from Gimlet Butte
and Soapy Sothern and

Still I dont quite see the joke

It aint any joke with them Serious business maam

What happened to start you on this line

The lad riding down the road on that piebald pinto He come twenty
miles out of his way plumb dressed for a wedding all to give me an
invite to a dance at Frasers Yu would call that real thoughtful of
him I expect

She gayly sparkled A real ranch dancethe kind you have been telling
me about Are Ida and I invited

Invited Slim hinted at a lynching if I came without yu

She laughed softly merry eyes flashing swiftly at him How gallant you
Westerners are even though you do turn it into burlesque

His young laugh echoed hers Burlesque nothing My life wouldnt be
worth a thing if I went alone Honest I wouldnt dare

Since the ranch cant afford to lose its foreman Ida and I will go
along she promised That is if it is considered proper here

Proper Good gracious maam Every lady for thirty miles round will be
there from six months old to eighty odd years It wouldnt be PROPER to
stay at home

The foreman drove her to Frasers in a surrey with Ida Henderson and one
of the Lazy D punchers on the back seat The drive was over twentyfive
miles but in that silent starry night every mile was a delight Part of
the way led through a beautiful canon along the rocky mountain road of
which the young man guided the rig with unerring skill Beyond the gorge
the country debouched into a grassy park that fell away from their feet
for miles It was in this basin that the Fraser ranch lay

The strains of the fiddle and the thumping of feet could be heard as
they drove up Already the rooms seemed to be pretty well filled as
Helen noticed when they entered Three sets were on the floor for a
quadrille and the house shook with the energy of the dancers On benches
against the walls were seated the spectators and on one of them stood
Texas calling the dance

Alemane left Right hand tyer pardner and grand right and left
Evvrybody swing chanted the caller

A dozen rough young fellows were clustered near the front door
apparently afraid to venture farther lest their escape be cut off
Through these McWilliams pushed a way for his charges the cowboys
falling back respectfully at once when they discovered the presence of
Miss Messiter

In the bedroom where she left her wraps the mistress of the Lazy D found
a dozen or more infants and several of their mothers In the kitchen
were still other women and babies some of the former very old and of
the latter very young A few of the babies were asleep but most of them
were still very much alive to this scene of unwonted hilarity in their
young lives

As soon as she emerged into the general publicity of the dancing room
her foreman pounced upon Helen and led her to a place in the head set
that was making up The floor was rough the music jerky and uncertain
the quadrilling an exhibition of joyous and awkward abandon but its
picturesque lack of convention appealed to the girl from Michigan It
rather startled her to be swung so vigorously but a glance about the
room showed that these humorouseyed Westerners were merely living up to
the duty of the hour as they understood it

At the close of the quadrille Helen found herself being introduced
to Mr Robins alias Slim who drew one of his feet back in an
embarrassed bow

I enjoy to meet yu maam he assured her and supplemented this with
a request for the next dance after which he fell into silence that was
painful in its intensity

Nearly all the dances were squares as few of those present understood
the intricacies of the waltz and twostep Hence it happened that the
proficient McWilliams secured three round dances with his mistress

It was during the lunch of sandwiches cake and coffee that Helen
perceived an addition to the company The affair had been advertised
a costume ball but most of those present had construed this very
liberally She herself to be sure had come as Mary Queen of Scots
Mac was arrayed in the scarlet tunic and tightfitting breeches of the
Northwest Mounted Police and perhaps eight or ten others had made
some attempt at representing some one other than they were She now saw
another apparently a new arrival standing in the doorway negligently
A glance told her that he was made up for a road agent and that his
revolvers and mask were a part of the necessary costuming

Slowly his gaze circled the room and came round to her His eyes were
hard as diamonds and as flashing so that the impact of their meeting
looks seemed to shock her physically He was a tall man swarthy of
hue and he carried himself with a light ease that looked silken strong
Something in the bearing was familiar yet not quite familiar either It
seemed to suggest a resemblance to somebody she knew And in the next
thought she knew that the somebody was Ned Bannister

The man spoke to Fraser just then passing with a cup of coffee and
Helen saw the two men approach The stranger was coming to be formally
introduced

Shake hands with Mr Holloway Miss Messiter Hes from up in the hill
country and he rode to our frolic Yuve got three guesses to figure
out what hes made up as

One will be quite enough I think she answered coldly

Fraser departed on his destination with the coffee and the newcomer sat
down on the bench beside her

Ones enough is it he drawled smilingly

Quite but Im surprised so few came in costume Why didnt you But I
suppose you had your reasons

Didnt I Im supposed to be a bad man from the hills

She swept him casually with an indifferent glance And isnt that what
you are in real life

His sharp scrutiny chiseled into her Whats that

You wont mind if I forget and call you Mr Bannister instead of Mr
Holloway

She thought his counterfeit astonishment perfect

So Im Ned Bannister am I

Their eyes clashed

Arent you

She felt sure of it and yet there was a lurking doubt For there was
in his manner something indescribably more sinister than she had felt
in him on that occasion when she had saved his life Then a debonair
recklessness had been the outstanding note but now there was something
ribald and wicked in him

Since yu put it as a question common politeness demands an answer
Ned Bannister is my name

You are the terror of this country

I shant be a terror to yu maam if I can help it he smiled

But you are the man they call the king

I have that honor

HONOR

At the sharp scorn of her accent he laughed

Do you mean that you are proud of your villainy she demanded

Yuve cetainly got the teacher habit of asking questions he replied
with a laugh that was a sneer

A shadow fell across them and a voice said quietly She didnt wait to
ask any when she saved your life down in the coulee back of the Lazy D

The shadow was Jim McWilliamss and its owner looked down at the man
beside the girl with steady hostile eyes

Is this your put in sir the other flashed back

Yes seh it is The boys dont quite like seeing your hardware so
prominent at a social gathering In this community guns dont come into
the house at a ranch dance Im a committee to mention the subject and
to collect your thirtyeights if yu agree with us

And if I dont agree with you

Theres all outdoors ready to receive yu seh It would be a pity to
stay in the one spot where your welcomes wore thin

Still I may choose to stay

Cetainly but if yu decide that way yu better step out on the porch
and talk it over with us where there aint ladies present

Isnt this a costume dance Whats the matter with my guns Im an
outlaw aint I

I dont know whether yu are or not seh If yu say yu are were
ready to take your word The guns have to be shucked if yu stay here
They might go off accidental and scare the ladies

The man rose blackly Ill remember this If yu knew who yu were
getting so gay with

I can guess Mr Holloway the kind of an outfit yu freight with and
I expect I could put a handle to another name for you

By God if yu dare to say

I dont dare especially among so many ladies came McWilliamss
jaunty answer

The eyes of the two men gripped after which Holloway swung on his heel
and swaggered defiantly out of the house

Presently there came the sound of a ponys feet galloping down the
road It had not yet died away when Texas announced that the supper
intermission was over

Pardners for a quadrille Ladies choice

The dance was on again full swing The fiddlers were tuning up and
couples gathering for a quadrille Denver came to claim Miss Messiter
for a partner Apparently even the existence of the vanished Holloway
was forgotten But Helen remembered it and pondered over the affair
long after daylight had come and brought with it an end to the
festivities



CHAPTER 6 A PARTY CALL

The mistress of the Lazy D just through with her morning visit to the
hospital in the bunkhouse stopped to read the gaudy poster tacked to
the wall It was embellished with the drawing of a placid rider astride
the embodiment of fury incarnate under which was the legend Stick to
Your Saddle

BIG FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION AT GIMLET BUTTE ROPING AND BRONCO
BUSTING CONTESTS FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WORLD AND BIG PRIZES
Including 1000 for the Best Rider and the Same for Best Roper Cow
Pony Races Ladies Races and Ladies Riding Contest Fireworks AND
FREE BARBECUE EVERYBODY COME AND TURN YOUR WOLF LOOSE

A sudden thud of pounding hoofs a snatch of ragtime and her foreman
swept up in a cloud of white dust His pony came from a gallop to an
instant halt and simultaneously Mac landed beside her one hand holding
the widebrimmed hat he had snatched off in his descent the other
hitched by a casual thumb to the belt of his chaps

She laughed You really did it very well

Mac blushed He was still young enough to take pride in his picturesque
regalia to prefer the dramatic way of doing a commonplace thing But
though he liked this girls trick of laughing at him with a perfectly
grave face out of those dark longlashed eyes he would have liked
it better if sometimes they had given back the applause he thought his
little tricks merited

Sho Thats foolishness he deprecated

I suppose they got you to sit for this picture and she indicated the
poster with a wave of her hand

That aint a real picture he explained and when she smiled added
as of course yu know No hawss ever pitched that wayand the saddle
aint right Fact is its all wrong

How did it come here It wasnt here last night

I reckon Denver brought it from Slausons He was ridin that country
yesterday and as the boys was out of smokin he come home that way

I suppose youll all go

I reckon

And youll ride

I aim to sit in

At the roping too

No mm I aint so much with the rope It takes a Mexican to snake a
rope

Then Ill be able to borrow only a thousand dollars from you to help
buy that bunch of young cows we were speaking about she mocked

Only a thousand he grinned And it aint a cinch Ill win There are
three or four straightup riders on this range A fellow come from the
HoleintheWall and won out last year

And where were you

Oh I took second prize he explained with obvious indifference

Well you had better get first this year Well have to show them the
Lazy D hasnt gone to sleep

Sure thing he agreed

Has that buyer from Cheyenne turned up yet she asked reverting to
business

Not yet Do yu want I should make the cut soon as he comes

Dont you think his price is a little lowtwenty dollars from brand
up

Its a scrub bunch We want to get rid of them anyway But youre the
doctor he concluded slangily

She thought a moment Well let him have them but dont make the cut
till I come back Im going to ride over to the Twin Buttes

His admiring eyes followed her as she went toward the pony that was
waiting saddled with the rein thrown to the ground She carried her
slim lithe figure with a grace a lightness that few women could have
rivaled When she had swung to the saddle she halfturned in her seat
to call an order to the foreman

I think Mac you had better run up those horses from Eagle Creek Have
Denver and Missou look after them

Sure maam he said aloud and to himself Shes cetainly a
thoroughbred Does everything well she tackles I never saw anything
like it Im a Chink if she doesnt run this ranch like she had been
at it forty years Same thing with her gasoline bronc That pinto too
Hes got a bad eye for fair but she makes him eat out of her hand I
reckon the pinto is like the rest of usclean mashed He put his arms
on the corral fence and grew introspective Blamed if I know what it is
about her Course shes a winner on looks but that aint it alone I
guess its on account of her being such a game little gentleman When
she turns that smile loose on a fellowwell theres sure sunshine in
the air And gamewhy Ned Bannister aint gamer himself

McWilliams had climbed lazily to the top board of the fence He was an
energetic youth but he liked to do his thinking at his ease Now as
his gaze still followed its lodestar he suddenly slipped from his seat
and ran forward pulling the revolver from its scabbard as he ran Into
his eyes had crept a tense alertness the shining watchfulness of the
tiger ready for its spring

The cause of the change in the foreman of the Lazy D was a simple one
and on its face innocent enough It was merely that a stranger had swung
in casually at the gate of the short stable lane and was due to
meet Miss Messiter in about ten seconds So far good enough A dozen
travelers dropped in every day but this particular one happened to be
Ned Bannister

From the stable door a shot rang out Bannister ducked and shouted
genially Try again

But Helen Messiter whirled her pony as on a halfdollar and charged
down on the stable

Who fired that shot she demanded her eyes blazing

The horsewrangler showed embarrassment He had found time only to lean
the rifle against the wall

I reckon I did maam Yu see

Did you get my orders about this feud she interrupted crisply

Yes maam but

Then you may call for your time When I give my men orders I expect
them to obey

I wouldnt a shot if Id knowed yu was so near him Yu was behind
that summer kitchen he explained lamely

You only expect to obey orders when Im in sight Is that it she
asked hotly and without waiting for an answer delivered her ultimatum
Well I wont have it I run this ranch as long as I am its owner Do
you understand

Yes maam I hadnt ought to have did it but when I seen Bannister it
come over me I owed him a pill for the one he sent me last week down in
the coulee So I up and grabbed the rifle and let him have it

Then you may up and grab your trunk for Medicine Hill Shorty will
drive you tomorrow

When she returned to her unexpected guest Helen found him in
conversation with McWilliams The latters gun had found again its
holster but his brown graceful hand hovered close to its butt

Seems like a long time since the Lazy D has been honored by a visit
from Mr Bannister he was saying with gentle irony

Thats right So I have come to make up for lost time came
Bannisters quiet retort

Miss Messiter did not know much about Wyoming human nature in the raw
but she had learned enough to be sure that the soft courtesy of these
two youths covered a stark courage that might leap to life any moment
Wherefore she interposed

Well be pleased to show you over the place Mr Bannister As it
happens we are close to the hospital Shall we begin there

Her cool silken defiance earned a smile from the visitor All your
cases doing well maam

Its very kind of you to ask I suppose you take an interest because
they are YOUR cases too in a way of speaking

Mine Indeed

Yes If it were not for you Im afraid our hospital would be empty

It must be right pleasant to be nursed by Miss Messiter I reckon the
boys are grateful to me for scattering my lead so promiscuous

I heard one say he would like to lam your haid tenderly murmured
McWilliams

With a twobyfour I suppose laughed Bannister

Shouldnt wonder But looking yu over casual it occurs to me
he might get sick of his job befo he turned yu loose McWilliams
admitted with a glance of admiration at the clean power showing in the
others supple lines

Nor could either the foreman or his mistress deny the tribute of their
respect to the bravado of this scamp who sat so jauntily his seat
regardless of what the next moment might bring forth Three wounded men
were about the place all presumably quite willing to get a clean
shot at him in the open One of them had taken his chance already and
missed Their visitor had no warrant for knowing that a second might not
any instant try his luck with better success Yet he looked every inch
the man on horseback no whit disturbed not the least conscious of
any danger Tall spare broad shouldered this berrybrown young man
crowned with closecropped curls sat at the gates of the enemy very
much at his insolent case

I came over to pay my party call he explained

It really wasnt necessary A run in the machine is not a formal
function

Maybe not in Kalamazoo

I thought perhaps you had come to get my purse and the sixtythree
dollars she derided

No maam nor yet to get that bunch of cows I was going to rustle from
you to buy an auto I came to ask you to go riding with me

The audacity of it took her breath Of all the outrageous things she had
ever heard this was the cream An acknowledged outlaw engaged in feud
with her retainers over that deadly question of the run of the range
he had sauntered over to the ranch where lived a dozen of his enemies
three of them still scarred with his bullets merely to ask her to go
riding with him The magnificence of his bravado almost obliterated its
impudence Of course she would not think of going The idea But her
eyes glowed with appreciation of his courage not the less because the
consciousness of it was so conspicuously absent from his manner

I think not Mr Bannister and her face almost imperceptibly
stiffened I dont go riding with strangers nor with men who shoot
my boys And Ill give you a piece of advice sir That is to burn
the wind back to your home Otherwise I wont answer for your life My
punchers dont love you and I dont know how long I can keep them from
you Youre not wanted here any more than you were at the dance the
other evening

McWilliams nodded Thats right Yu better roll your trail seh and
if yu take my advice youll throw gravel lively I seen two of the
boys cutting acrost that pasture five minutes ago They looked as if
they might be haided to cut yu off and I allow it may be their night
to howl Miss Messiter dont want to be responsible for yu getting lead
poisoning

Indeed Their visitor looked politely interested This solicitude for
me is very touching I observe that both of you are carefully blocking
me from the bunkhouse in order to prevent another practiceshot If I
cant persuade you to join me in a ride Miss Messiter I reckon Ill
go while Im still unpunctured He bowed and gathered the reins for
departure

One moment Mr McWilliams and I are going with you the girl
announced

Changed your mind Think youll take a little pasear after all

I dont want to be responsible for your killing Well see you safe off
the place she answered curtly

The foreman fell in on one side of Bannister his mistress on the other
They rode in close formation to lessen the chance of an ambuscade
Bannister alone chatted at his debonair ease ignoring the
responsibility they felt for his safety

I got my ride after all he presently chuckled To be sure I wasnt
expecting Mr McWilliams to chaperon us But thats an added pleasure

Would it be an added pleasure to get bumped off to kingdom come
drawled the foreman giving a reluctant admiration to his aplomb

Thinking of those willing boys of yours again are you laughed
Bannister Theyre cetainly a heap prevalent with their hardware but
their hunting dont seem to bring home any meat

By the way how IS your ankle Mr Bannister I forgot to ask This
shot from the young woman

He enjoyed it with internal mirth They did happen on the target that
time he admitted Oh its getting along fine but I aim to do most
of my walking on horseback for a while

They swept past the first dangerous grove of cottonwoods in safety and
rounded the boundary fence corner

Theyre in that bunch of pines over there said the foreman after a
single sweep of his eyes in that direction

Yes I see they are You oughtnt to let your boys wear red bandannas
when they go gunning Miss Messiter Its an awful careless habit

Helen herself could see no sign of life in the group of pines but she
knew their keen trained eyes had found what hers could not Riding with
one or another of her cowboys she had often noticed how infallibly they
could read the country for miles around A scattered patch on a distant
hillside though it might be a halfhours ride from them told them a
great deal more than seemed possible To her the dark spots sifted on
that slope meant scrub underbrush if there was any meaning at all in
them But her riders could tell not only whether they were alive but
could differentiate between sheep and cattle Indeed McWilliams could
nearly always tell whether they were HER cattle or not He was unable to
explain to her how he did it By a sort of instinct she supposed

The pines were negotiated in safety and on the part of the men with a
carelessness she could not understand For after they had passed
there was a spot between her shoulderblades that seemed to tingle in
expectation of a possible bullet boring its way through But she would
have died rather than let them know how she felt

Perhaps Bannister understood however for he remarked casually I
wouldnt be ambling past so leisurely if I was riding alone It makes
a heap of difference who your company is too Those punchers wouldnt
take a chance at me now for a million dollars

No theyre some haidstrong but they aint plumb locoed agreed Mac

Fifteen minutes later Helen drew up at the line corner Well part
company here Mr Bannister I dont think there is any more danger from
my men

Before we part there is something I want to say I hold that a man has
as much right to run sheep on these hills as cows Its government land
and neither one of us owns it Its bound to be a case of the survival
of the fittest If sheep are hardier and more adapted to the country
then cows have got to vamos Thats nature as it looks to me The
buffalo and the antelope have gone and I guess cows have got to take
their turn

Her scornful eyes burned him You came to tell me that did you Well
I dont believe a word of it Ill not yield my rights without a fight
You may depend on that

Here too nodded her foreman Im with my boss clear down the line
And as soon as she lets me turn loose my sixgun youll hear it pop
seh

I have not a doubt of it Mr McWilliams returned the sheepman
blithely In the meantime I was going to say that though most of my
interests are in sheep instead of cattle

I thought most of your interests were in other peoples property
interrupted the young woman

It goes into sheep ultimately he smiled Now what I am trying to
get at is this Im in debt to you a heap Miss Messiter and since Im
not all yellow cur I intend to play fair with you I have ordered my
sheep back across the deadline You can have this range to yourself for
your cattle The fights off so far as we personally are concerned

A hint of deeper color touched her cheeks Her manner had been cavalier
at best for the most part frankly hostile and all the time the man was
on an errand of goodwill Certainly he had scored at her expense and
she was ashamed of herself

Yu mean that youre going to respect the deadline asked Mac in
surprise

I didnt say quite that explained the sheepman What I said was
that I meant to keep on my side of it so far as the Lazy D cattle are
concerned Ill let your range alone

But yu mean to cross it down below where the Bar DoubleE cows run

Bannisters gay smile touched the sardonic face Do you invite the
public to examine your hand when you sit into a game of poker Mr
McWilliams

Youre dead right Its none of my business what yu do so long as
yu keep off our range admitted the foreman And next time the
conversation happens on Mr Bannister Ill put in my little sayso that
he aint all black

Thats very good of you sir was the others ironical retort

The girls gauntleted hand offered itself impulsively We cant be
friends under existing circumstances Mr Bannister But that does not
alter the fact that I owe you an apology You came as a peace envoy and
one of my men shot at you Of course he did not understand the reason
why you came but that does not matter I did not know your reason
myself and I know I have been very inhospitable

Are you shaking hands with Ned Bannister the sheepman or Ned Bannister
the outlaw asked the owner of that name with a queer little smile
that seemed to mock himself

With Ned Bannister the gentleman If there is another side to him I
dont know it personally

He flushed underneath the tan but very plainly with pleasure Your
opinions are right contrary to Hoyle maam Arent you aware that a
sheepman is the lowest thing that walks Ask Mr McWilliams

I have known stockmen of that opinion but

The foremans sentence was never finished From a clump of bushes
a hundred yards away came the crack of a rifle A bullet sang past
cutting a line that left on one side of it Bannister on the other Miss
Messiter and her foreman Instantly the two men slid from their horses
on the farther side dragged down the young woman behind the cover
of the broncos and arranged the three ponies so as to give her the
greatest protection available Somehow the weapons that garnished them
had leaped to their hands before their feet touched the ground

That coyote isnt one of our men Ill back that opinion high said
McWilliams promptly

Who is he the girl whispered

Thats what were going to find out pretty soon returned Bannister
grimly Chances are its me he is trying to gather Now Im going to
make a break for that cottonwood When I go you better run up a white
handkerchief and move back from the firingline Turn Buck loose when
you leave Hell stay around and come when I whistle

He made a run for it zigzagging through the sagebrush so swiftly as to
offer the least certain mark possible for a sharpshooter Yet twice the
rifle spoke before he reached the cottonwood

Meanwhile Mac had fastened the handkerchief of his mistress on the end
of a switch he had picked up and was edging out of range His tense
narrowed gaze never left the bushclump from which the shots were being
pumped and he was careful during their retreat to remain on the danger
side of the road in order to cover Helen

I guess Bannisters right He dont want us whoever he is

And even as he murmured it the wind of a bullet lifted his hat from
his head He picked it up and examined it The course of the bullet was
marked by a hole in the wide brim and two more in the side and crown

He cetainly ventilated it proper I reckon maam well make a run
for it Lie low on the pintos neck with your haid on the off side
Thats right Let him out

A mile and a half farther up the road Mac reined in and made the
Indian peacesign Two dejected figures came over the hill and resolved
themselves into punchers of the Lazy D Each of them trailed a rifle by
his side

Youre a fine pair of ringtailed snorters aint yu jeered the
foreman Got to get gay and go projectin round on the shoot after yu
got your orders to stay hitched Anything to say for yoselves

If they had it was said very silently

Now Miss Messiter is going to pass it up this time but from now on
yu dont go off on any private massacrees while yu punch at the Lazy
D Git that This hyer is the last call for supper in the diningcah If
yu miss it yull feed at some other chuckhouse Suddenly the drawl
of his sarcasm vanished His voice carried the ring of peremptory
command Jim yu go back to the ranch with Miss Messiter AND KEEP
YOUR EYES OPEN Missou I need yu Were going back I reckon yu
better hang on to the stirrup for we got to travel some Adios
senorita

He was off at a slow lope on the road he had just come the other man
running beside the horse Presently he stopped as if the arrangement
were not satisfactory and the second man swung behind him on the pony
Later when she turned in her saddle she saw that they had left the
road and were cutting across the plain as if to take the sharpshooter
in the rear

Her troubled thoughts stayed with her even after she had reached the
ranch She was nervously excited keyed up to a high pitch for she knew
that out on the desert within a mile or two of her men were stalking
each other with life or death in the balance as the price of vigilance
skill and an unflawed steel nerve While she herself had been in danger
she had been mistress of her fear But now she could do nothing but
wait after ordering out such reinforcements as she could recruit
without delay and the inaction told upon her swift impulsive
temperament Once twice the wind brought to her a faint sound

She had been pacing the porch but she stopped white as a sheet Behind
those faint explosions might lie a sinister tragedy Her mind projected
itself into a score of imaginary possibilities She listened breathless
in her tensity but no further echo of that battlefield reached her The
sun still shone warmly on brown Wyoming She looked down into a rolling
plain that blurred in the distance from knobs and flat spaces into a
single stretch that included a thousand rises and depressions That roll
of country teemed with life but the steady inexorable sun beat down
on what seemed a shining primeval waste of space Yet somewhere in
that space the tragedy was being determinedunless it had been already
enacted

She wanted to scream The very stillness mocked her So too did the
clicking windmill with its monotonous regularity Her pony still stood
saddled in the yard She knew that her place was at home and she fought
down a dozen times the tremendous impulse to mount and fly to the field
of combat

She looked at her watch How slowly the minutes dragged It could not
be only five minutes since she had looked last time Again she fell to
pacing the long west porch and interrupted herself a dozen times to
stop and listen

I can bear it no longer she told herself at last and in another
moment was in the saddle plying her pinto with the quirt

But before she reached the first cottonwoods she saw them coming Her
glasses swept the distant group and with a shiver she made out the
dreadful truth They were coming slowly carrying something between
them The girl did not need to be told that the object they were
bringing home was their dead or wounded

A figure on horseback detached itself from the huddle of men and
galloped towards her He was coming to break the news But who was the
victim Bannister or McWilliams she felt sure by reason of the sinking
heart in her and then it came home that she would be hard hit if it
were either

The approaching rider began to take distinct form through her glasses
As he pounded forward she recognized him It was the man nicknamed
Denver The wind was blowing strongly from her to him and while he was
still a hundred yards away she hurled her question

His answer was lost in the wind sweep but one word of it she caught
That word was Mac



CHAPTER 7 THE MAN FROM THE SHOSHONE FASTNESSES

Though the sharpshooters rifle cracked twice during his run for the
cottonwood the sheepman reached the tree in safety He could dodge
through the brush as elusively as any man in Wyoming It was a trick he
had learned on the whitewashed football gridiron For in his buried past
this man had been the noted halfback of a famous college and one of
his specialties had been running the ball back after a catch through a
broken field of opponents The lesson that experience had then thumped
into him had since saved his life on more than one occasion

Having reached the tree Bannister took immediate advantage of the lie
of the ground to snake forward unobserved for another hundred feet
There was a dip from the foot of the tree down which he rolled into the
sage below He wormed his way through the thick scrub brush to the edge
of a dry creek into the bed of which he slid Then swiftly his body
bent beneath the level of the bank he ran forward in the sand He moved
noiselessly eyes and ears alert to aid him and climbed the bank at a
point where a live oak grew

Warily he peeped out from behind its trunk and swept the plain for his
foe Nothing was to be seen of him Slowly and patiently his eyes again
went over the semicircle before him for where death may lurk behind
every foot of vegetation every bump or hillock the plainsman leaves
as little as may be to chance No faintest movement could escape the
sheepmans eyes no least stir fail to apprise his ears Yet for many
minutes he waited in vain and the delay told him that he had to do with
a trained hunter rather than a mere reckless cowpuncher For somewhere
in the rough country before him his enemy lay motionless every faculty
alive to the least hint of his presence

It was the whirring flight of a startled dove that told Bannister the
whereabouts of his foe Two hundred yards from him the bird rose
and the direction it took showed that the man must have been trailing
forward from the opposite quarter The sheepman slipped back into the
dry creek bed retraced his steps for about a stonethrow and again
crawled up the bank

For a long time he lay face down in the grass his gaze riveted to the
spot where he knew his opponent to be hidden A faint rustle not born
of the wind stirred the sage Still Bannister waited A less experienced
plainsman would have blazed away and exposed his own position But not
this young man with the steelwire nerves Silent as the coming of
dusk no breaking twig or displaced brush betrayed his selfcontained
presence

Something in the clump he watched wriggled forward and showed
indistinctly through an opening in the underscrub He whipped his rifle
into position and fired twice The huddled brown mass lurched forward
and disappeared

Wonder if I got him Seems to me I couldnt have missed clean thought
Bannister

Silence as before vast and unbroken

A scramble of running feet tearing a path through the brush a crouching
body showing darkly for an eyeflash and then the pounding of a horses
retreating feet

Bannister leaped up ran lightly across the intervening space and with
his repeater took a potshot at the galloping horseman

Missed he muttered and at once gave a sharp whistle that brought his
pony to him on the trot He vaulted to the saddle and gave chase It was
rough going but nothing in reason can stop a cowpony As sure footed
as a mountain goat as good a climber almost as a cat Buck followed the
flying horseman over perilous rock rims and across deepcut creek beds
Pantherlike he climbed up the steep creek sides without hesitation for
the roundup had taught him never to falter at stiff going so long as
his rider put him at it

It was while he was clambering out of the sheer sides of a wash that
Bannister made a discovery The man he pursued was wounded Something in
the manner of the fellows riding had suggested this to him but a drop
of blood splashed on a stone that happened to meet his eye made the
surmise a certainty

He was gaining nownot fast almost imperceptibly but none the less
surely He could see the man looking over his shoulder once twice and
then again with that hurried fearful glance that measures the approach
of retribution Barring accidents the man was his

But the unforeseen happened Buck stepped in the hole of a prairie
dog and went down Over his head flew the rider like a stone from a
catapult

How long Ned Bannister lay unconscious he never knew But when he came
to himself it was none too soon He sat up dizzily and passed his hand
over his head Something had happened

What was it Oh yes he had been thrown from his horse A wave
of recollection passed over him and his mind was clear once more
Presently he got to his feet and moved rather uncertainly toward Buck
for the horse was grazing quietly a few yards from him

But half way to the pony he stopped Voices approaching by way of the
bed of Dry Creek drifted to him

He must a turned and gone back Mebbe he guessed we was there

And a voice that Bannister knew one that had a strangely penetrant
cruel ring of power through the drawl made answer Judd said before
he fainted he was sure the man was Ned Bannister Id cetainly like to
meet up with my beloved cousin right now and even up a few old scores
By God Id make him sick before I finished with him

Ill bet yu would Cap returned the other admiringly Think wed
better deploy here and beat up the scenery a few as we go

There are times when the mind works like lightning flashes its messages
on the wings of an electric current For Bannister this was one of them
The whole situation lighted for him plainly as if it had been explained
for an hour

His cousin had been out with a band of his cutthroats on some errand
and while returning to the fastnesses of the Shoshone Mountains had
stopped to noon at a cow spring three or four miles from the Lazy D
Judd Morgan whom he knew to be a lieutenant of the notorious bandit
had ridden toward the ranch in the hope of getting an opportunity to
vent his anger against its mistress or some of her men While pursuing
the renegade Bannister had stumbled into a hornets nest and was in
imminent danger of being stung to death Even now the last speaker was
scrambling up the bank toward him

The sheepman had to choose between leaving his rifle and immediate
flight The latter was such a forlorn hope that he gave up Buck for the
moment and ran back to the place where his repeating Winchester had
fallen Without stopping he scooped the rifle up as he passed In his
day he had been a famous sprinter and he scudded now for dear life
It was no longer a question of secrecy The sound of men breaking their
hurried way through the heavy brush of the creek bank came crisply to
him A voice behind shouted a warning and from not a hundred yards in
front of him came an answering shout Hemmed in from the fore and the
rear he swung off at a right angle An open stretch lay before him but
he had to take his desperate chance without cover Anything was better
than to be trapped like a wild beast driven by the beaters to the guns

Across the bare brown mesa he plunged and before he had taken a dozen
steps the first rifle had located its prey and was sniping at him
He had perhaps a hundred yards to cover ere the mesa fell away into a
hollow where he might find temporary protection in the scrub pines
And now a second marksman joined himself to the first But he was going
fast already had covered half the distance and it is no easy thing to
bring down a live dodging target

Again the first gun spoke and scored another miss whereat a mocking
devilish laugh rang out in the sunshine

Yu boys splash a heap of useless lead around the horizon I reckon
Cousin Neds my meat Yu see I get him in the flapper without spoiling
him complete And at the word he flung the rifle to his shoulder and
fired with no apparent aim

The running man doubled up like a cottontail but found his feet again
in an instant though one arm hung limp by his side He was within a
dozen feet of the hilldrop and momentary safety

Shall I take him Cap cried one of the men

No hes mine The rifle smoked once more and again the runner went
down But this time he plunged headlong down the slope and out of sight

The outlaw chief turned on his heel I reckon hell not run any more
today Bring him into camp and well take him along with us he said
carelessly and walked away to his horse in the creek bed

Two of the men started forward but they stopped half way as if rooted
to the ground For a galloping horseman suddenly drew up at the very
point for which they were starting He leaped to the ground and warned
them back with his rifle While he covered them a second man rode up and
lifted Bannister to his saddle

Ready Mac he gave the word and both horses disappeared with
their riders over the brow of the hill When the surprised desperadoes
recovered themselves and reached that point the rescuers had disappeared
in the heavy brush

The alarm was at once given and their captain cursing them in a
raucous bellow for their blunder ordered immediate pursuit It was some
little time before the trail of the fugitives was picked up but once
discovered they were over hauled rapidly

Were not going to get out without swapping lead McWilliams admitted
anxiously I wisht yu wasnt hampered with that load but I reckon
Ill have to try to stand them off alone

We bucked into a slice of luck when I opened on his bronc mavericking
around alone Hadnt been for that we could never have made it said
Missou who never crossed a bridge until he came to it

We havent made it yet old hoss not by a long mile and two more on
top o that Theyre beginning to pump lead already Huh Got to drap
your pills closern that fore yu worry me

I believe hes daid anyway said Missou presently peering down into
the white face of the unconscious man

Got to hang onto the remains anyhow for Miss Helen Those coyotes are
too much of the wolf breed to leave him with them

Looks like theyre gittin the aim some better equably remarked the
other a minute later when a spurt of sand flew up in front of him

Theyre cetainly crowding us I expaict I better send them a
Howdedo so as to discourage them a few He took as careful aim as
he could on the galloping horse but his bullet went wide

Theyre gaining like sixty Its my offhand opinion we better stop at
that bunch of trees and argue some with them No use buckjumpin along
to burn the wind while they drill streaks of light through us

All right Take the trees Yull be able to get into the game some
then

They debouched from the road to the little grove and slipped from their
horses

Deadern hell murmured Missou as he lifted the limp body from his
horse But I guess well pack whats left back to the little lady at
the Lazy D

The leader of the pursuers halted his men just out of range and came
forward alone holding his right hand up in the usual signal of peace
In appearance he was not unlike Ned Bannister There was the same long
slim tiger build with the flowing muscles rippling easily beneath the
loose shirt the same effect of power and dominance the same clean
springy stride The pose of the head too even the sweep of salient
jaw bore a marked resemblance But similarity ceased at the expression
For instead of frankness there lurked here that hint of the devil of
strong passion uncontrolled He was the victim of his own moods and in
the space of an hour one might perhaps read in that face cold cunning
cruel malignity leering ribaldry as well as the hardbitten virtues of
unflinching courage and implacable purpose

I reckon youre near enough suggested Mac when the man had
approached to within a hundred feet of the tree clump

Yure drawing the deadline the other acknowledged indolently
It wont take ten words to tell yu what I want and mean to have Im
giving yu two minutes to hand me over the body of Ned Bannister If
yu dont see it that way Ill come and make a lead mine of your whole
outfit

Yu cant come too quick seh Were here ashootin and dont yu
forget it was McWilliamss prompt answer

The sinister face of the man from the Shoshones darkened Yuve signed
your own death warrants he let out through set teeth and at the word
swung on his heel

The balls about to open Pardners for a waltz Have a dustcutter
Mac before she grows warm

The puncher handed over his flask and the other held it before his eye
and appraised the contents in approved fashion Dont mind if I do
Heres how

How echoed Missou in turn and tipped up the bottle till the liquor
gurgled down his baked throat

Hes fanning out his men so as to get us both at the front and back
door Lucky there aint but four of them

I guess we better lie back to back proposed Missou If our lucks
good I reckon theyre going to have a gay time rushing this fort

A few desultory shots had already been dropped among the cottonwoods
and returned by the defendants when Missou let out a yell of triumph

Glory Hallelujah Here comes the boys splittin down the road
hellforleather That lopsided ringtailed snorter of a hawssthief
is gathering his wolves for a hike back to the tall timber Feed me a
cigareet Mac I plumb want to celebrate

It was as the cowpuncher had said Down the road a cloud of dust
was sweeping toward them in the centre of which they made out three
hardriding cowboys from the ranch Farther back in the distance was
another dust whirl The outlaw chiefs hard vigilant gaze swept over
the reinforcements and decided instantly that the game had gone against
him for the present He whistled shrilly twice and began a slow retreat
toward the hills The miscreants flung a few defiant shots at the
advancing cowmen and disappeared swallowed up in the earth swells

The homeward march was a slow one for Bannister had begun to show signs
of consciousness and it was necessary to carry him with extreme care
While they were still a mile from the ranch house the pinto and its
rider could be seen loping toward them

Ride forward Denver and tell Miss Helen were coming Better have her
get everything fixed to doctor him soon as we get there Give him the
best show in the world and hell still be sailing awful close to the
divide Ill bet a hundred plunks hell cash in anyway

DONE

The voice came faintly from the improvised litter Mac turned with
a start for he had not known that Bannister was awake to his
surroundings The man appeared the picture of helplessness all the
lusty power and vigor stricken out of him but his indomitable spirit
still triumphed over the physical collapse for as the foreman looked
a faint smile touched the ashen lips It seemed to say Still in the
ring old man



CHAPTER 8 IN THE LAZY D HOSPITAL

Helens first swift glance showed that the wounded man was Bannister
She turned in crisp command to her foreman

Have him taken to my room and put to bed there We have no time to
prepare another And send one of the boys on your best horse for a
doctor

They carried the limp figure in with rough tenderness and laid him in
the bed McWilliams unbuckled the belt and drew off the chaps then
with the help of Denver undressed the wounded man and covered him
with quilts So Helen found him when she came in to attend his wounds
bringing with her such things as she needed for her task Mrs Winslow
the housekeeper assisted her and the foreman stayed to help but it
was on the mistress of the ranch that the responsibility of saving him
fell Missou was already galloping to Bear Creek for a doctor but the
girl knew that the battle must be fought and the issue decided before he
could arrive

He had fallen again into insensibility and she rinsed and dressed his
wounds working with the quiet impersonal certainty of touch that did
not betray the inner turmoil of her soul But McWilliams his eyes
following her every motion and alert to anticipate her needs saw that
the color had washed from her face and that she was controlling herself
only to meet the demands of the occasion

As she was finishing the sheepman opened his eyes and looked at her

You are not to speak or ask questions You have been wounded and we are
going to take care of you she ordered

Thats right good of yu I cetainly feet mighty trifling His wide
eyes traveled round till they fell on the foreman Yu see I came
back to help fill your hospital Am I there now Where am I His gaze
returned to Helen with the sudden irritation of the irresponsible sick

You are at the Lazy D in my room You are not to worry about anything
Everythings all right

He took her at her word and his eyes closed but presently he began to
mutter unconnected words and phrases When his lids lifted again there
was a wilder look in his eyes and she knew that delirium was beginning
At intervals it lasted for long indeed until the doctor came next
morning in the small hours He talked of many things Helen Messiter did
not understand of incidents in his past life some of them jerky with
the excitement of a tense moment others apparently snatches of talk
with relatives It was like the babbling of a child irrelevant and yet
often insistent He would in one breath give orders connected with the
lambing of his sheep in the next break into football talk calling out
signals and imploring his men to hold them or to break through and get
the ball Once he broke into curses but his very oaths seemed to come
from a clean heart and missed the vulgarity they might have had Again
his talk rambled inconsequently over his youth and he would urge
himself or someone else of the same name to better life

Ned Ned remember your mother he would beseech She asked me to
look after you Dont go wrong Or else it would be Dont disgrace
the general Ned Youll break his heart if you blacken the old name
To this theme he recurred repeatedly and she noticed that when he
imagined himself in the East his language was correct and his intonation
cultured though still with a suggestion of a Southern softness

But when he spoke of her his speech lapsed into the familiar drawl of
Cattleland I aint such a sweep as yu think girl Some day Ill sure
tell yu all about it and how I have loved yu ever since yu scooped
me up in your car Youre the gamest little lady To see yu come
asailin down after me so steady and businesslike not turning a hair
when the bullets hummedI sure do love yu Helen And then he fell
upon her first name and called her by it a hundred times softly to
himself

This happened when she was alone with him just before the doctor came
She heard it with starry eyes and with a heart that flushed for joy a
warmer color into her cheeks Brushing back the short curls she kissed
his damp forehead It was in the thick of the battle before he had
weathered that point where the issues of life and death pressed closely
and even in the midst of her great fears it brought her comfort She was
to think often of it later and always the memory was to be music in
her heart Even when she denied her love for him assured herself it was
impossible she could care for so shameful a villain even then it was
a sweet torture to allow herself the luxury of recalling his broken
delirious phrases At the very worst he could not be as bad as
they said some instinct told her this was impossible His fearless
devilmaycare smile his jaunty gallant bearing these pleaded against
the evidence for him And yet was it conceivable that a man of spirit a
gentleman by training at least would let himself lie under the odium
of such a charge if he were not guilty Her tangled thoughts fought this
profitless conflict for days Nor could she dismiss it from her mind
Even after he began to mend she was still on the rack For in some
snatch of good talk when the fine quality of the man seemed to glow in
his face poignant remembrance would stab her with recollection of the
difference between what he was and what he seemed to be

One of the things that had been a continual surprise to Helen was the
short time required by these deepcheated and cleanblooded Westerners
to recover from apparently serious wounds It was scarce more than two
weeks since Bannister had filled the bunkhouse with wounded men and
already two of them were back at work and the third almost fit for
service For perhaps three days the sheepmans life hung in the balance
after which his splendid constitution and his outdoor life began to
tell The thermometer showed that the fever had slipped down a notch
and he was now sleeping wholesomely a good part of his time Altogether
unless for some unseen contingency the doctor prophesied that the
sheepman was going to upset the probabilities and get well

Which merely shows maam what is possible when you give a sound man
twentyfour hours a day in our hills for a few years he added Thanks
to your nursing hes going to shave through by the narrowest margin
possible I told him today that he owed his life to you Miss
Messiter

I dont think you need have told him that Doctor returned that young
woman not a little vexed at him especially since you have just been
telling me that he owes it to Wyoming air and his own soundness of
constitution

When she returned to the sickroom to give her patient his medicine
he wanted to tell her what the doctor had said but she cut him off
ruthlessly and told him not to talk

Maynt I even say Thank you he wanted to know

No you talk far too much as it is

He smiled All right Yu sit there in that chair where I can see yu
doing that fancywork and Ill not say a word Itll keep all right
what I want to say

I notice you keep talking she told him dryly

Yes maam Yu had better have let me say what I wanted to but Ill
be good now

He fell asleep watching her and when he awoke she was still sitting
there though it was beginning to grow dark He spoke before she knew he
was awake

Im going to get well the doctor thinks

Yes he told me she answered

Did he tell yu it was your nursing saved me

Please dont think about that

What am I to think about I owe yu a heap and it keeps piling up I
reckon yu do it all because its your Christian duty he demanded

It is my duty isnt it

I didnt say it wasnt though I expaict Bighorn County will forget to
give yu a unanimous vote of thanks for doing it I asked if yu did it
because it was your duty

The reason doesnt matter so that I do it she answered steadily

Reasons matter some too though they aint as important as actions out
in this country Back in Boston they figure more and since yu used to
go to school back there yu hadnt ought to throw down your professor of
ethics

Dont you think you have talked enough for the present she smiled
and added If I make you talk whenever I sit beside you I shall have to
stay away

Thats where yuve cetainly got the drop on me maam Im a clam
till yu give the word

Before a week he was able to sit up in a chair for an hour or two and
soon after could limp into the living room with the aid of a walking
stick and his hostess Under the tan he still wore an interesting
pallor but there could be no question that he was on the road to
health

A man doesnt know what hes missing until he gets shot up and is
brought to the Lazy D hospital so as to let Miss Messiter exercise her
Christian duty on him he drawled cheerfully observing the sudden
glow on her cheek brought by the reference to his unanswered question

He made the lounge in the big sunny window his headquarters From it
he could look out on some of the ranch activities when she was not with
him could watch the line riders as they passed to and fro and command
a view of one of the corrals There was always too the turquoise sky
out of which poured a flood of light on the roll of hilltops Sometimes
he read to himself but he was still easily tired and preferred usually
to rest More often she read aloud to him while he lay back with his
leveled eyes gravely on her till the gentle cool abstraction she
affected was disturbed and her perplexed lashes rose to reproach the
intensity of his gaze

She was of those women who have the heavenborn faculty of making home
of such fortuitous elements as are to their hands Except her piano and
such knickknacks as she had brought in a single trunk she had had to
depend upon the resources of the establishment to which she had come
but it is wonderful how much can be done with some Navajo rugs a
bearskin a few bits of Indian pottery and woven baskets and a judicious
arrangement of scenic photographs In a few days she would have her
pictures from Kalamazoo pending which her touch had transformed the big
living room from a cheerless barn into a spot that was a comfort to
the eye and heart To the wounded man who lay there slowly renewing the
blood he had lost the room was the apotheosis of home less perhaps by
reason of what it was in itself than because it was the setting for her
presencefor her grave sympathetic eyes the sound of her clear voice
the light grace of her motion He rejoiced in the delightful intimacy
the circumstances made necessary To hear snatches of joyous song and
gay laughter even from a distance to watch her as she came in and out
on her daily tasks to contest her opinions of books and life and see
how eagerly she defended them he wondered himself at the strength of
the appeal these simple things made to him Already he was dreading the
day when he must mount his horse and ride back into the turbulent life
from which she had for a time snatched him

Ill hate to go back to sheepherding he told her one day at lunch
looking at her across a snowwhite tablecloth upon which were a service
of shining silver fragile china teacups and plates stamped Limoges

He was at the moment buttering a delicious French roll and she was
daintily pouring tea from an old family heirloom The contrast between
this and the dust and the grease of a midday meal at the end of a chuck
wagon lent accent to his smiling lamentation

A lot of sheepherding you do she derided

A shepherd has to look after his sheep yu know

You herd sheep just about as much as I punch cows

I have to herd my herders anyhow and that keeps me on the move

Im glad there isnt going to be any more trouble between you and the
Lazy D And that reminds me of another thing Ive often wonered who
those men could have been that attacked you the day you were hurt

She had asked the question almost carelessly without any thought that
this might be something he wished to conceal but she recognized her
mistake by the wariness that filmed his eyes instantly

Room there for a right interesting guessing contest he replied

You wouldnt need to guess she charged on swift impulse

Meaning that I know

You do know You cant deny that you now

Well say that I know

Arent you going to tell

He shook his head Not just yet Ive got private reasons for keeping
it quiet a while

Im sure they are creditable to you came her swift ironic retort

Sure he agreed whimsically I must live up to the professional
standard Honor among thieves yu know



CHAPTER 9 MISS DARLING ARRIVES

Miss Messiter clung to civilization enough at least to prefer that her
chambermaid should be a woman rather than a Chinese It did not suit her
preconceived idea of the proper thing that Lee Ming should sweep floors
dust bricabrac and make the beds To see him sloshsloshing around
in his felt slippers made her homesick for Kalamazoo There were other
reasons why the proprieties would be better served by having another
woman about the place reasons that had to do with the chaperone system
that even in the uncombed West make its claims upon unmarried
young women of respectability She had with her for the present
fourteenyearold Ida Henderson but this arrangement was merely
temporary

Wherefore on the morning after her arrival Helen had sent two letters
back to the States One of these had been to Mrs Winslow a widow of
fiftyfive inviting her to come out on a business basis as housekeeper
of the Lazy D The buxom widow had loved Helen since she had been a
toddling baby and her reply was immediate and enthusiastic Eight
days later she had reported in person The second letter bore the
affectionate address of Nora Darling Detroit Michigan This also in
time bore fruit at the ranch in a manner worthy of special mention

It was the fourth day after Ned Bannister had been carried back to the
Lazy D that Helen Messiter came out to the porch of the house with a
letter in her hand She found her foreman sitting on the steps waiting
for her but he got up as soon as he heard the fall of her light
footsteps behind him

You sent for me maam he asked hat in hand

Yes I want you to drive into Gimlet Butte and bring back a person whom
youll find at the Elk House waiting for you I had rather you would go
yourself because I know youre reliable

Thank you maam How will I know him

Its a womana spinster Shes coming to help Mrs Winslow Inquire
for Miss Darling She isnt used to jolting two days in a rig but I
know you will be careful of her

Ill surely be as careful of the old lady as if she was my own mother

The mistress of the ranch smothered a desire to laugh

Im sure you will At her age she may need a good deal of care Be
certain you take rug enough

Ill take care of her the best I know how Expect shes likely
rheumatic but Ill wrop her up till she looks like a Cheyenne squaw
when tourist is trying to get a free shoot at her with camera

Please do I want her to get a good impression of Wyoming so that she
will stay I don know about the rheumatism but you might ask her

There were pinpoints of merriment behind the guileless innocence of her
eyes but they came to the surface only after the foreman had departed

McWilliams ordered a team of young horse hitched and presently set out
on his two day journey to Gimlet Butte He reached that town in good
season left the team at a corral and walked back to the Elk House
The white dust of the plains was heavy on him from the bandanna
that loosely embraced the brown throat above the flannel shirt to the
encrusted boots but through it the good humor of his tanned face smiled
fraternally on a young woman he passes at the entrance to the hotel Her
gay smile met his cordially and she was still in his mind while he
ran his eye down the register in search of the name he wanted There
it wasMiss Nora Darling Detroit Michiganin the neatest of little
round letters under date of the previous days arrivals

Is Miss Darling in asked McWilliams of the halfgrown son of the
landlady who served in lieu of clerk and porter

Nope Went out a little while ago Said to tell anybody to wait that
asked for her

Mac nodded relieved to find that duty had postponed itself long enough
for him to pursue the friendly smile that had not been wasted on him
a few seconds before He strolled out to the porch and decided at once
that he needed a cigar more than anything else on earth He was helped
to a realization of his need by seeing the owner of the smile disappear
in an adjoining drug store

She was beginning on a nut sundae when the puncher drifted in She
continued to devote even her eyes to its consumption while the foreman
opened a casual conversation with the drug clerk and lit his cigar

How are things coming in Gimlet Butte he asked by way of prolonging
his stay rather than out of desire for information

Yes she certainly had the longest softest lashes he had ever seen and
the ripest of cherry lips behind the smiling depths of which sparkled
two rows of tiny pearls He wished she would look at HIM and smile
again There wasnt any use trying to melt a sundae with it anyhow

Sure its a good year on the range and the price of cows jumping he
heard his subconscious self make answer to the patronizing inquiries of
him of the boiled shirt

Funny how pretty hair of that color was especially when there was so
much of it You might call it a sort of coppery gold where the little
curls escaped in tendrils and ran wild A fellow

Yes I reckon most of the boys will drop around to the Fourth of July
celebration Got to cut loose once in a while yu know

A shy glance shot him and set him atingle with a queer delight
Gracious what pretty dark velvety lashes she had

She was rising already and as she paid for the ice cream that innocent
gaze smote him again with the brightest of Irish eyes conceivable It
lingered for just a ponderable sunlit moment or him She had smiled once
more

After a decent interval Mac pursued his petit charmer to the hotel
She was seated on the porch reading a magazine and was absorbedly
unconscious of him when he passed For a few awkward moments he hung
around the office then returned to the porch and took the chair most
distant from her He had sat there a long ten minutes before she let
her hands and the magazine fall into her lap and demurely gave him his
chance

Can you tell me how far it is to the Lazy D ranch

Seventytwo miles as the crow flies maam

Thank you

The conversation threatened to die before it was well born Desperately
McWilliams tried to think of something to say to keep it alive without
being too bold

If yu were thinking of traveling out that way I could give yu a lift
I just came in to get another ladyan old lady that has just come to
this country

Thank you but Im expecting a conveyance to meet me here You didnt
happen to pass one on the way I suppose

No I didnt What ranch were yu going to maam

Miss Messitersthe Lazy D

A suspicion began to penetrate the foremans brain Yu aint Miss
Darling

What makes you so sure Im not she asked tilting her dimpled chin
toward him aggressively

Yure too young he protested helplessly

Im no younger than you are came her quick indignant retort

Thus boldly accused of his youth the foreman blushed I didnt mean
that Miss Messiter said she was an old lady

You neednt tell fibs about it She couldnt have said anything of the
kind Who are you anyhow the girl demanded with spirit

Im the foreman of the Lazy D come to get Miss Darling My name is
McWilliamsJim McWilliams

I dont need your first name Mr McWilliams she assured him
sweetly And will you please tell me why you have kept me waiting here
more than thirty hours

Miss Messiter didnt get your letter in time Yu see we dont get
mail every day at the Lazy D he explained the while he hopefully
wondered just when she was going to need his last name

I dont see why you dont go after your mail every day at least
especially when Miss Messiter was expecting me To leave me waiting
here thirty hoursIll not stand it When does the next train leave for
Detroit she asked imperiously

The situation seemed to call for diplomacy and Jim McWilliams moved to
a nearer chair Im right sorry it happened maam and Ill bet Miss
Messiter is too Yu see we been awful busy one way and nother and I
plumb neglected to send one of the boys to the postoffice

Why didnt one of them walk over after supper she demanded severely

He curbed the smile that was twitching at his facial muscles

Well o course it aint so faronly fortythree milesstill

Fortythree miles to the postoffice

Yes maam only fortythree If youll excuse me this time

Is it really fortythree

He saw that her sudden smile had brought out the dimples in the oval
face and that her petulance had been swept away by his astounding
information

Fortythree sure as shootin except twict a week when it comes to
Slausons and thats only twenty miles he assured her Used to be
seventytwo but the Government got busy with its rural free delivery
and now we get it right at our doors

You must have big doors she laughed

All out o doors he punned Yu see our house is under our hat and
like as not thats twenty miles from the ranchhouse when night falls

Dear me She swept his graceful figure sarcastically And of course
twenty miles from a brush too

He laughed with deep delight at her thrust for the warm youth in him
did not ask for pointed wit on the part of a young woman so attractive
and with a manner so delightfully provoking

I expaict I have gathered up some scenery on the journey Ill go brush
it off and get ready for supper Id admire to sit beside yu and pass
the butter and the hash if yu dont object Yu see I dont often meet
up with ladies and Id ought to improve my table manners when I get
a chanct with one so much older than I am and o course so much more
experienced

I see you dont intend to pass any honey with the hash she flashed
with a glimpse of the pearls

DIDNT yu say yu was older than me I believe Ive plumb forgot how
old yu said yu was Miss Darling

Your memorys such a sieve it wouldnt be worth while telling you
After youve been to school a while longer maybe Ill try you again

Some ladies like em young he suggested amiably

But full grown she amended

Do yu judge by my looks or my ways he inquired anxiously

By both

Thats right strange he mused aloud For judging by some of your
ways youre the spinster Miss Messiter was telling me about but judging
by your looks yure only the prettiest and sassiest twentyyearold in
Wyoming

And with this shot he fled to see what transformation he could effect
with the aid of a whiskbroom a tin pan of alkali water and a roller
towel

When she met him at the supper table her first question was Did Miss
Messiter say I was an old maid

Sho I wouldnt let that trouble me if I was yu A woman aint any
older than she looks Your age dont show to speak of

But did she

I reckon she laid a trap for me and I shoved my paw in She wanted to
give me a pleasant surprise

Oh

Dont yu grow anxious about being an old maid There aint any in
Wyoming to speak of If yu like Ill tell the boys youre worried
and some of them will be JohnnieontheSpot Theyre awful gallant
cowpunchers are

Some of them may be she differed If you want to know Im just
twentyone

He sawed industriously at his steak Yu dont say Just old enough to
votelike this steer was before they massacreed him

She gave him one look and thereafter punished him with silence

They left Gimlet Butte early next morning and reached the Lazy D shortly
after noon on the succeeding day McWilliams understood perfectly that
strenuous competition would inevitably ensue as soon as the Lazy D
beheld the attraction he had brought into their midst Nor did he need
a phrenologist to tell him that Nora was a born flirt and that her shy
slant glances were meant to penetrate tough hides to tender hearts
But this did not discourage him and he set about making his individual
impression while he had her all to himself He wasnt at all sure how
deep this went but he had the satisfaction of hearing his first name
the one she had told him she had no need of fall tentatively from her
pretty lips before the other boys caught a glimpse of her

Shortly after his arrival at the ranch Mac went to make his report to
his mistress of some business matters connected with the trip

I see you got back safely with the old lady she laughed when she
caught sight of him

His look reproached her Yu said a spinster

But it was you that insisted on the rheumatism By the way did you ask
her about it

We didnt get that far he parried

Oh How far did you get She perched herself on the porch railing and
mocked him with her friendly eyes Her heart was light within her and
she was ready for anything in the way of fun for the doctor had just
pronounced her patient out of danger if he took proper care of himself

About as fur as I got with yu maam he audaciously retorted

We might disagree as to how far that is she flung back gayly with
heightened color

No maam I dont think we would

But gracious Youre not a Mormon You dont want us both do you
she demanded her eyes sparkling with the exhilaration of the tilt

Could I get either one of yu do yu reckon Thats whats worrying
me

I see and so you intend to keep us both on the string

His joyous laughter echoed hers I expaict yu would call that
presumption or some other dictionary word wouldnt yu

In anybody else perhaps but surely not in Mr McWilliams

Im awful glad to be trotting in a class by myself

And youll let us know when you have made your mind up which of us it
is to be

Well mine aint the only mind that has to be made up he drawled

She took this up gleefully I cant answer for Nora but Ill jump at
the chanceif you decide to give it to me

He laughed delightedly into the hat he was momentarily expecting to put
on Ill mill it over a spell and let yu know maam

Yes think it over from all points of view Of course she is prettier
but then Im not afflicted with rheumatism and probably wouldnt flirt
as much afterward I have a good temper too as a rule but then so has
Nora

Oh shes prettier is she With boyish audacity he grinned at her

What do you think

He shook his head Ill have to go to the foot of the class on that
maam Give me an easier one

Ill have to choose another subject then What did you do about that
bunch of Circle 66 cows you looked at on your way in

They discussed business for a few minutes after which she went back to
her patient and he to his work

Aint she a straightup little gentleman for fair the foreman asked
himself in rhetorical and exuberant question slapping his hat against
his leg as he strode toward the corral Think of her coming at me like
she did the blamed little thoroughbred Yu bet she knows me down to
the ground and how sudden I got over any fool notions I might astarted
to get in my cocoanut But the way she came back at me quick as
lightning and then some pretendin all that foolishness and knowin all
the time Id savez the game

Both McWilliams and his mistress had guessed right in their surmise as
to Nora Darlings popularity in the cow country She made an immediate
and pronounced hit It was astonishing how many errands the men found to
take them to the house as they called the building where the mistress
of the ranch dwelt Bannister served for a time as an excellent
excuse Judging from the number of the inquiries which the men found
it necessary to make as to his progress Helen would have guessed
him exceedingly popular with her riders Having a sense of humor she
mentioned this to McWilliams one day

He laughed and tried to turn it into a compliment to his mistress But
she would have none of it

I know better sir They dont come here to see me Nora is the
attraction and I have sense enough to know it My nose is quite out of
joint she laughed

Mac looked with gay earnestness at the feature she had mentioned
Theres a heap of difference in noses he murmured apparently apropos
of nothing

Thats another way of telling me that Noras pug is the sweetest thing
you ever saw she charged

I aint half such a bad actor as some of the boys he deprecated

Meaning in what way

The Nora Darling way

He pronounced her name so much as if it were a caress that his mistress
laughed and he joined in it

Its your fickleness that is breaking my heart though I knew I was
lost as soon as I saw your beatific look on the day you got back with
Nora The first week I came none of you could do enough for me Now its
all Nora darling She mimicked gayly his intonation

Well maam its this way explained the foreman with a grin
Yure right pleasant and friendly but the boys have got a savvy way
down deep that yud shuck that friendliness awful sudden if any of them
dropped around with Object Matrimony in their manner Consequence
is theyre loaded down to the ground with admiration of their boss
but they aint presumptuous enough to expaict any more I had notions
mebbe Id cut more ice me being not afflicted with bashfulness My
notions faded maam in about a week

Then Nora came she laughed

No maam they had gone glimmering long before she arrived I was just
convalescent enough to need being cheered up when she drapped in

And are you cheered up yet his mistress asked

He took off his dusty hat and scratched his head I aint right
certain yet maam Soon as I know Im consoled Ill be round with an
invite to the wedding

That is if you are

If I amyes Yu cant most always tell when they have eyes like
hers

Youre quite an authority on the sex considering your years

Yes maam He looked aggrieved thinking himself a man grown How
did yu say Mr Bannister was

Wait and Ill send Nora out to tell you she flashed and disappeared
in the house

Conversation at the bunkhouse and the chucktent sometimes circled
around the young women at the house but its personality rarely grew
pronounced References to Helen Messiter and the housemaid were usually
by way of repartee at each other For a change had come over the spirit
of the Lazy D men and though a cheerful profanity still flowed freely
when they were alone together vulgarity was largely banished

The morning after his conversation with Miss Messiter McWilliams
was washing in the foremans room when the triangle beat the call for
breakfast and he heard the cooks raucous Come and get it There was
the usual stampede for the tent and a minute later Mac flung back the
flap and entered He took the seat at the head of the table along the
benches on both sides of which the punchers were plying busy knives and
forks

A stack of chips ordered the foreman and the cooks Coming up was
scarcely more prompt than the plate of hot cakes he set before the young
man

Hen fruit sunny side up shouted Reddy who was further advanced in
his meal

Tame that foghorn son advised Wun Hop but presently he slid three
fried eggs from a fryingpan into the plate of the hungry one

I want yu boys to finish flankin that bunch of hill calves today
said the foreman emptying half a jug of syrup over his cakes

Redtop he aint got no appetite these days grinned Denver as the
gentleman mentioned cleaned up a second loaded plate of ham eggs and
fried potatoes I see him studying a Wind River Bible yesterday
Curious how in the spring a young mans fancy gits to wandering on house
furnishing Red he was taking the catalogue alphabetically Carpets was
absorbin his attention chairs on deck and chandeliers in the hole as
we used to say when we was baseball kids

  A Wind River Bible in the Northwest ranch country is a
 catalogue of one of the big Chicago department stores that
 does a large shipping business in the West

Aint a word of truth in it indignantly denied the assailed his
unfinished nose and chin giving him a pathetic whipped puppy look
Sho I was just looking up saddles Cant a fellow buy a new saddle
without asking leave of Denver

Cyarpets used to begin with a C in my spellingbook but saddles got
off right foot fust with a S suggested Mac amiably

He was cetainly trying to tree his saddle among the Cs He was
looking awful loving at a Turkish rug Reckon he thought it was a
saddleblanket derided Denver cheerfully

Huh Yure awful smart Denver retaliated Reddy his complexion
matching his hair Yu talk a heap with your mouth Nobody believes a
word of what yu say

Denver relaxed into a range song by way of repartee

I want mighty bad to be married To have a garden and a home I
cetainly aim to git married And have a gyurl for my own

Aw Yu fresh guys make me tired Yu dont devil me a bit not a bit
Whyfor should I care what yu say I guess this outfit aint got no
surcingle on me Nevertheless he made a hurried end of his breakfast
and flung out of the tent

Yu boys hadnt ought to wound Reddys tender feelings and him so bent
on matrimony said Denver innocently Get a move on them fried spuds
and sashay them down this way if theres any left when yu fill your
plate Missou

Nor was Reddy the only young man who had dreams those days at the Lazy
D Cupid must have had his hands full for his darts punctured more than
one honest plainsmans heart The reputation of the young women at the
Lazy D seemed to travel on the wings of the wind and from far and near
Cattleland sent devotees to this shrine of youth and beauty So casually
the victims drifted in always with a good business excuse warranted to
endure raillery and sarcasm that it was impossible to say they had come
of set purpose to sun themselves in feminine smiles

As for Nora it is not too much to say that she was having the time of
her life Detroit Michigan could offer no such field for her expansive
charms as the Bighorn country Wyoming Here she might have her pick
of a hundred and every one of them picturesquely begirt with flannel
shirt knotted scarf at neck an arsenal that bristled and a suntan
that could be achieved only in the outdoors of the Rockies Certainly
these knights of the saddle radiated a romance with which even her
floorwalker gentleman friend could not compete



CHAPTER 10 A SHEPHERD OF THE DESERT

It had been Helen Messiters daily custom either to take a ride on her
pony or a spin in her motor car but since Bannister had been quartered
at the Lazy D her time had been so fully occupied that she had given
this up for the present The arrival of Nora Darling however took so
much work off her hands that she began to continue her rides and drives

Her patient was by this time so far recovered that he did not need her
constant attendance and there were reasons why she decided it best to
spend only a minimum of her time with him These had to do with her
increasing interest in the man and the need she felt to discourage it
It had come to a pretty pass she told herself scornfully when she
found herself inventing excuses to take her into the room where this
most picturesque of unhanged scamps was lying Most good women are at
heart puritans and if Helen was too liberal to judge others narrowly
she could be none the less rigid with herself She might talk to him of
her duty but it was her habit to be frank in thought and she knew that
something nearer than that abstraction had moved her efforts in his
behalf She had fought for his life because she loved him She could
deny it no longer Nor was the shame with which she confessed it
unmingled with pride He was a man to compel love one of the mood
imperative chainarmored in the outdoor virtues of strength and
endurance and stark courage Her abasement began only where his
superlation ended That a being so godlike in equipment should have been
fashioned without a soul and that she should have given her heart to
him This was the fount of her degradation

It was of these things she thought as she drove in the late afternoon
toward those Antelope Peaks he had first pointed out to her She swept
past the scene of the battle and dipped down into the plains for a run
to that western horizon behind the jagged mountain line of which the sun
was radiantly setting in a splash of glorious colors Lost in thought
space slipped under her wheels unnoticed Not till her car refused the
spur and slowed to a despondent halt did she observe that velvet night
was falling over the land

She prowled round the machine after the fashion of the motorist
examining details that might be the cause of the trouble She discovered
soon enough with instant dismay that the gasolene tank was empty Reddy
always unreliable must have forgotten to fill it when she told him to

By the road she must be thirty miles from home if she were a step
across country as the crow flies perhaps twenty She was a young woman
of resolution and she wasted no time in tears or regrets The XIX
ranch owned by a small nester named Henderson could not be more than
five or six miles to the southeast If she struck across the hills she
would be sure to run into one of the barblines At the XIX she could
get a horse and reach the Lazy D by midnight Without any hesitation she
struck out It was unfortunate that she did not have on her heavy laced
high boots but she realized that she must take things as she
found them Things might have been a good deal worse she reflected
philosophically

And before long they were worse for the increasing darkness blotted out
the landmarks she was using as guides and she was lost among the hill
waves that rolled one after another across the range Still she did not
give way telling herself that it would be better after the moon was
up She could then tell north from south and so have a line by which to
travel But when at length the stars came out thousands upon thousands
of them and looked down on a land magically flooded with chill
moonlight the girl found that the transformation of Wyoming into this
sense of silvery loveliness had toned the distant mountain line to an
indefinite haze that made it impossible for her to distinguish one peak
from another

She wandered for hours hungry and tired and frightened though this
last she would not confess

Theres nothing to be afraid of she told herself over and over Even
if I have to stay out all night it will do me no harm Theres no need
to be a baby about it

But try to evade it as she would there was something in the loneliness
of this limitless stretch of hilltop that got on her nerves The
very shadows cast by the moonshine seemed too fantastic for reality
Something eerie and unearthly hovered over it all and before she knew
it a sob choked up her throat

Vague fancies filtered through her mind weird imaginings born of the
night in a mind that had been swept from the moorings of reason So
that with no sensible surprise there came to her in that moonlit sea of
desert the sound of a voice a clear sweet tenor swelling bravely in song
with the very ecstacy of pathos

It was the prison song from Il Trovatore and the desolation of its
lifted appeal went to the heart like water to the roots of flowers

 Ah I have sighd to rest me
 Deep in the quiet grave

The girls sob caught in her breast stilled with the awe of that
heavenly music So for an instant she waited before it was borne in on
her that the voice was a human one and that the heaven from which it
descended was the hilltop above her

A wild laugh followed by an oath cut the dying echoes of the song She
could hear the swish of a quirt falling again and again and the sound
of trampling hoofs thudding on the hard suncracked ground Startled
she sprang to her feet and saw silhouetted against the skyline a horse
and his rider fighting for mastery

The battle was superb while it lasted The horse had been a famous
outlaw broken to the saddle by its owner out of the sheer passion
for victory but there were times when its savage strength rebelled at
abject submission and this was one of them It swung itself skyward
and came down like a piledriver camelbacked and without joints in
the legs Swiftly it rose again lunging forward and whirling in the air
then jarred down at an angle The brute did its malevolent best a fury
incarnate But the ride was a match and more than a match for it He
sat the saddle like a Centaur with the perfect unconscious grace of a
born master swaying in his seat as need was and spurring the horse to
a blinder fury

Sudden as had been the start no less sudden was the finish of the
battle The bronco pounded to a stifflegged standstill trembled for
a long minute like an aspen and sank to a tame surrender despite the
sharp spurs roweling its bloody sides

Ah my beauty Youve had enough have you demanded the cruel
triumphant voice of the rider You would try that game would you Ill
teach you

Stop spurring that horse you bully

The man stopped in sheer amazement at this apparition which had leaped
out of the ground almost at his feet His wary glance circled the hills
to make sure she was alone

Cetainly maam Were sure delighted to meet up with you Aint we
Twostep

For himself he spoke the simple truth He lived in his sensations
spurring himself to fresh ones as he had but just now been spurring
his horse to sate the greed of conquest in him And this highspirited
gallant creaturehe could feel her vital courage in the very ring
of her voiceoffered a rare fillip to his jaded appetite The dusky
longlashed eyes which always give a woman an effect of beauty the
splendid fling of head and the piquant finely cut features with their
unconscious tale of Brahmin caste the long lines of the supple body
willowy and yet plump as a partridgethey went to his head like strong
wine Here was an adventure from the godsa stubborn will to bend the
pride of a haughty young beauty to trail in the dust her untamed heart
to break if need be The lust of the battle was on him already She was
a woman to dream about

 Sweeter than the lids of Junos eyes
 Or Cythereas breath

he told himself exultantly as he slid from his horse and stood bowing
before her

And he for his part was a taking enough picture of devilmaycare
gallantry gone to seed The touch of jaunty impudence in his humility
not less than the daring admiration of his handsome eyes and the easy
sinuous grace of his flexed muscles labeled him what he wasa man bold
and capable to do what he willed and a villain every inch of him

Said she after that first clash of stormy eyes with bold admiring
ones

I am lostfrom the Lazy D ranch

Why no youre found he corrected white teeth flashing in a smile

My motor ran out of gasolene this afternoon Ive beenthere was a
catch in her voicewandering ever since

Youre played out of course and yuve had no supper he said his
quiet close gaze on her

Yes Im played out and my nerves gone She laughed a little
hysterically I expect Im hungry and thirsty too though I hadnt
noticed it before

He whirled to his saddle and had the canteen thongs unloosed in a
moment While she drank he rummaged from his saddlebags some sandwiches
of jerky and a flask of whiskey She ate the sandwiches he the while
watching her with amused sympathy in his swarthy countenance

You aint halfbad at the chuckwagon Miss Messiter he told her

She stopped the sandwich part way to her mouth I dont remember your
face Ive met so many people since I came to the Lazy D Still I think
I should remember you

He immediately relieved of duty her quasi apology You havent seen
my face before he laughed and though she puzzled over the double
meaning that seemed to lurk behind his words and amuse him she could
not find the key to it

It was too dark to make out his features at all clearly but she was
sure she had seen him before or somebody that looked very much like him

Life on the range aint just what yu can call exciting he continued
and when a young lady fresh from back East drops among us while sixguns
are popping breaks up a likely feud and mends right neatly all the
ventilated feudists its a corollary to her fun thats she is going to
become famous

What he said was true enough The unsolicited notoriety her exploit had
brought upon her had been its chief penalty Garbled versions of it had
appeared with fake pictures in New York and Chicago Sunday supplements
and all Cattleland had heard and discussed it No matter into what
unfrequented canon she rode some silent cowpuncher would look at her
as they met with admiring eyes behind which she read a knowledge of the
story It was a lonely desolate country full of the wide deep silences
of utter emptiness yet there could be no footfall but the whisper of it
was bruited on the wings of the wind

Do you know where the Lazy D ranch is from here she asked

He nodded

Can you take me home

I surely can But not tonight Youre more tired than yu know Well
camp here and in the moning well hit the trail bright and early

This did not suit her at all Is it far to the Lazy D she inquired
anxiously

Every inch of forty miles Theres a creek not more than two hundred
yards from here Well stay there till morning he made answer in a
matter of course voice leading the way to the place he had mentioned

She followed protesting Yet though it was not in accord with her
civilized sense of fitness she knew that what he proposed was the
common sense solution She was tired and worn out and she could see
that his broncho had traveled far

Having reached the bank of the creek he unsaddled watered his horse
and picketed it and started a fire Uneasily she watched him

I dont like to sleep out Isnt there a ranchhouse near

Yu wouldnt call it near by the time we had reached it Whats to
hinder your sleeping here Isnt this room airy enough And dont yu
like the system of lighting Twas patented I forget how many million
years ago Yu aint going to play parlor girl now after getting the
reputation yuve got for gameness are yu

But he knew well enough that it was no silly schoolgirl fear she had
but some deep instinct in her that distrusted him and warned her to
beware So lightly he took up the burden of the talk while he gathered
cottonwood branches for the fire

Now if Id only thought to bring a load of lumber and some
carpentersand a chaperon he chided himself in burlesque his bold
eyes closely on the girls face to gloat on the color that flew to her
cheeks at his suggestion

She hastened to disclaim lightly the feeling he had unmasked in her It
is a pity but it cant be helped now I suppose I am cross and dont
seem very grateful Im tired out and nervous but I am sure that Ill
enjoy sleeping out If I dont I shall not be so ungenerous as to blame
you

He soon had a cup of steaming coffee ready for her and the heat of it
made a new woman of her She sat in the warm fire glow and began
to feel stealing over her a delightful reaction of languor She told
herself severely it was ridiculous to have been so foolishly prim about
the inevitable

Since you know my name isnt it fair that I should know yours she
smilingly asked more amiably than she had yet spoken to him

Well since I have found the lamb that was lost yu may call me a
shepherd of the desert

Then Mr Shepherd Im very glad to meet you I dont remember when
I ever was more glad to meet a stranger And she added with a little
laugh Its a pity Im too sleepy to do my duty by you in a social
way

Well let that wait till tomorrow Yull entertain me plenty then
Ill make your bunk up right away

She was presently lying with her feet to the fire snugly rolled in his
saddle blankets But though her eyes were heavy her brain was still
too active to permit her to sleep immediately The excitement of her
adventure was too near the emotions of the day too poignantly vivid to
lose their hold on her at once For the first time in her life she
lay lapped in the illimitable velvet night countless unwinking stars
lighting the blueblack dream in which she floated The enchantment of
the nights loveliness swept through her sensitive pulses and thrilled
her with the mystery of the great life of which she was an atom Awe
held her a willing captive

She thought of many things of her past life and its incongruity with
the present of the man who lay wounded at the Lazy D of this other
wideshouldered vagabond who was just now in the shadows beyond the
firelight pacing up and down with long light even strides as he looked
to his horse and fed the fire She watched him make an end of the things
he found to do and then take his place opposite her Who and what was
he this fascinating scamp who one moment flooded the moonlit desert
with inspired snatches from the opera sung in the voice of an angel and
the next lashed at his horse like a devil incarnate How reconcile the
outstanding inconsistencies in him For his every inflection every
motion proclaimed the strain of good blood gone wrong and trampled
under foot of set sardonic purpose indicated him a man of culture in
a hell of his own choosing Lounging on his elbow in the flickering
shadows so carelessly insouciant in every picturesque inch of him he
seemed to radiate the melodrama of the untamed frontier just as her
guest of tarnished reputation now at the ranch seemed to breathe forth
its romance

Sleep well little partner Dont be afraid nothing can harm you
this man had told her

Promptly she had answered Im not afraid thank you in the least
and after a moment had added not to seem hostile Good night big
partner

But despite her calm assurance she knew she did not feel so entirely
safe as if it had been one of her own ranch boys on the other side of
the fire or even that other vagabond who had made so direct an appeal
to her heart If she were not afraid at least she knew some vague hint
of anxiety

She was still thinking of him when she fell asleep and when she
awakened the first sound that fell on her ears was his tuneful whistle
Indeed she had an indistinct memory of him in the night wrapping the
blankets closer about her when the chill air had half stirred her from
her slumber The day was still very young but the abundant desert light
dismissed sleep summarily She shook and brushed the wrinkles out of her
clothes and went down to the creek to wash her face with the inadequate
facilities at hand After redressing her hair she returned to the fire
upon which a coffee pot was already simmering

She came up noiselessly behind him but his trained senses were apprised
of her approach

Good moning How did yu find your bedroom he asked without turning
from the bacon he was broiling on the end of a stick

Quite up to the specifications With all Wyoming for a floor and the
sky for a ceiling I never had a room I liked better But have you eyes
in the back of your head

He laughed grimly I have to be all eyes and ears in my business

Is your business of a nature so sensitive

As much so as stocks on Wall Street And we havent any ticker to warn
us to get under cover Do you take cream in your coffee Miss Messiter

She looked round in surprise Cream

Were in tincan land you know and live on airtights I milk my cow
with a canopener Let me recommend this quail on toast He handed her
a battered tin plate and prepared to help her from the fryingpan

I suppose that is another name for pork

No really I happened to bag a couple of hooters before you wakened

Youre a missionary of the goodfoods movement I shall name your
mission St SherrysintheWilderness

Ah Sherrys Thats since my time I dont suppose I should know my
way about in little old New York now

She found him eager to pick up again the broken strands that had
connected him with the big world from which he had once come It had
been long since she had enjoyed a talk more for he expressed himself
with wit and dexterity But through her enjoyment ran a note of
apprehension He was for the moment a resurrected gentleman But what
would he be next She had an insistent memory of a heavenly flood of
music broken by a horrible discord of raucous oaths

It was he that lingered over their breakfast loath to make the first
move to bring him back into realities and it was she that had to
suggest the need of setting out But once on his feet he saddled and
packed swiftly with a deftness born of experience

Well have to ask Twostep to carry double today he said as he
helped her to a place behind him

Twostep had evidently made an end of the bronco spree upon which he
had been the evening before for he submitted sedately to his unusual
burden The first hilltop they reached had its surprise to offer the
girl In a little valley below them scarce a mile away nestled a ranch
with its corrals and buildings

Look she exclaimed and then swiftly Didnt you know it was there

Yes thats the Hilke place he answered with composure It hasnt
been occupied for years

Isnt that some one crossing to the corral now

No A stray cow I reckon

They dropped into a hollow between the hills and left the ranch on their
left She was not satisfied and yet she had not grounds enough upon
which to base a suspicion For surely the figure she had seen had been
that of a man



CHAPTER 12 MISTRESS AND MAID

Now that it was safely concluded Helen thought the adventure almost
worthwhile for the spontaneous expressions of good will it had drawn
forth from her adherents Mrs Winslow and Nora had taken her to
their arms and wept and laughed over her in turn and in their silent
undemonstrative way she had felt herself hedged in by unusual solicitude
on the part of her riders It was goodnone but she knew how goodto
be back among her own to bask in a friendliness she could not doubt
It was best of all to sit opposite Ned Bannister again with no weight on
her heart from the consciousness of his unworthiness

She could affect to disregard the gray eyes that followed her with
such magnetized content about the living room but beneath her cool
selfcontainment she knew the joyous heart in her was strangely buoyant
He loved her and she had a right to let herself love him This was
enough for the present

Theyre so plumb glad to see yu they cant let yu alone laughed
Bannister at the sound of a knock on the door that was about the fifth
in as many minutes

This time it proved to be Nora come to find out what her mistress would
like for supper Helen turned to the invalid

What would you like Mr Bannister

I should like a porterhouse with mushrooms he announced promptly

You cant have it You know what the doctor said Very peremptorily
she smiled this at him

Hes an old granny Miss Messiter

You may have an egg on toast

Make it two he pleaded Excitements just like caviar to the
appetite and seeing yu safe

Very welltwo she conceded

They ate supper together in a renewal of the pleasant intimacy so
delightful to both He lay on the lounge propped up with sofa cushions
the while he watched her deft fingers butter the toast and prepare his
egg It was surely worth while to be a convalescent given so sweet a
comrade for a nurse and after he had moved over to the table he enjoyed
immensely the gay firmness with which she denied him what was not good
for him

Ill bet yu didnt have supper like this at Robbers Roost he told
her enthusiastically

It wasnt so bad considering everything She was looking directly at
him as she spoke Your cousin is rather a remarkable man in some ways
He manages to live on the best that can be got in tincan land

Did he tell yu he was my cousin he asked slowly

Yes and that his name was Ned Bannister too

Did that explain anything to yu

It explained a great deal but it left some things not clear yet

For instance

For one thing the reason why you should bear the odium of his crimes
I suppose you dont care for him though I can see how you might in a
way

I dont care for him in the least though I used to when we were
boys As to letting myself be blamed for his crimes I did it because
I couldnt help myself We look more or less alike and he was cunning
enough to manufacture evidence against me We were never seen together
and so very few know that there are two Bannisters At first I used to
protest but I gave it up There wasnt the least use I could only wait
for him to be captured or killed In the meantime it didnt make me any
more popular to be a sheepman

Werent you taking a long chance of being killed first Some one with a
grudge against him might have shot you

They havent yet he smiled

You might at least have told me how it was she reproached

I started to tell yu that first day but it looked so much of a fairy
tale to unload that I passed it up

Then you ought not to blame me for thinking you what you were not

I dont remember blaming yu The fact is I thought it awful white of
yu to do your Christian duty so thorough me being such a miscreant
he drawled

You gave me no chance to think well of you

But yet yu did your duty from A to Z

Were not talking about my duty she flashed back My point is that
you werent fair to me If I thought ill of you how could I help it

I expaict your Kalamazoo conscience is worryin yu because yu
misjudged me

It isnt she denied instantly

I aint of a revengeful disposition Ill forgive yu for doing your
duty and saving my life twice he said with a smile of whimsical
irony

I dont want your forgiveness

Well then for thinking me a bad man

You ought to beg my pardon I was a friend at least you say I acted
like oneand you didnt care enough to right yourself with me

Maybe I cared too much to risk trying it I knew there would be proof
some time and I decided to lie under the suspicion until I could get
it I see now that wasnt kind or fair to you I am sorry I didnt tell
yu all about it May I tell yu the story now

If you wish

It was a long story but the main points can be told in a paragraph The
grandfather of the two cousins General Edward Bannister had worn the
Confederate gray for four years and had lost an arm in the service of
the flag with the stars and bars After the war he returned to his
home in Virginia to find it in ruins his slaves freed and his fields
mortgaged He had pulled himself together for another start and
had practiced law in the little town where his family had lived for
generations Of his two sons one was a neerdowell He was one of
those brilliant fellows of whom much is expected that never develops
He had a taste for low company married beneath him and after a career
that was a continual mortification and humiliation to his father was
killed in a drunken brawl under disgraceful circumstances leaving
behind a son named for the general The second son of General Bannister
also died young but not before he had proved his devotion to his father
by an exemplary life He too was married and left an only son also
named for the old soldier The boys were about of an age and were well
matched in physical and mental equipment But the general who had taken
them both to live with him soon discovered that their characters were
as dissimilar as the poles One grandson was frank generous open as
the light the other was of a nature almost degenerate In fact each
had inherited the qualities of his father Tales began to come to the
old generals ears that at first he refused to credit But eventually
it was made plain to him that one of the boys was a rake of the most
objectionable type

There were many stormy scenes between the general and his grandson but
the boy continued to go from bad to worse After a peculiarly flagrant
case involving the character of a respectable young girl young Ned
Bannister was forbidden his ancestral home It had been by means of his
cousin that this last iniquity of his had been unearthed and the boy
had taken it to his grandfather in hot indignation as the last hope of
protecting the reputation of the injured girl From that hour the evil
hatred of his cousin always dormant in the heart flamed into active
heat The disowned youth swore to be revenged A short time later the
general died leaving what little property he had entirely to the one
grandson This stirred again the bitter rage of the other He set fire
to the house that had been willed his cousin and took a train that
night for Wyoming By a strange irony of fate they met again in the
West years later and the enmity between them was renewed growing every
month more bitter on the part of the one who called himself the King of
the Bighorn Country

She broke the silence after his story with a gentle Thank you I can
understand why you dont like to tell the story

I am very glad of the chance to tell it to you he answered

When you were delirious you sometimes begged some one you called Ned
not to break his mothers heart I thought then you might be speaking to
yourself as ill people do Of course I see now it was your cousin that
was on your mind

When I was out of my head I must have talked a lot of nonsense
he suggested in the voice of a question I expect I had opinions I
wouldnt have been scattering around so free if Id known what I was
saying

He was hardly prepared for the tide of color that swept her cheeks at
his words nor for the momentary confusion that shuttered the shy eyes
with long lashes cast down

Sick folks do talk foolishness they say he added his gaze trained
on her suspiciously

Do they

Mrs Winslow says I did But when I asked her what it was I said she
only laughed and told me to ask yu Well Im askin now

She became very busy over the teapot You talked about the work at your
ranchsheep dipping and such things

Was that all

No about lots of other thingsfootball and your early life I dont
see what Mrs Winslow meant Will you have some more tea

No thank yu I have finished Yes that cetainly seems harmless I
didnt know but I had been telling secrets Still his unwavering eyes
rested quietly on her

Secrets She summoned her aplomb to let a question rest lightly in
the face she turned toward him though she was afraid she met his
eyes hardly long enough for complete innocence Why yes secrets He
measured looks with her deliberately before he changed the subject and
he knew again the delightful excitement of victory Are yu going to
read to me this evening

She took his opening so eagerly that he smiled at which her color
mounted again

If yu like What shall I read

Some more of Barries books if yu dont mind When a fellow is weak
as a kitten he sorter takes to things that are about kids

Nora came in and cleared away the supper things She was just beginning
to wash them when McWilliams and Denver dropped into the kitchen by
different doors Each seemed surprised and disappointed at the presence
of the other Nora gave each of them a smile and a dishcloth

Reddy hes shavin and Friscos struggling with a biled shirtI mean
with a necktie Denver hastily amended Theyll be along right soon I
shouldnt wonder

Yu better go tell the boys Miss Nora dont want her kitchen littered
up with so many of them suggested his rival

Yure foreman here I dont aim to butt into your business Mac
grinned back the other polishing a tea plate with the towel

I want to get some table linen over to Lee Ming tonight said Nora
presently

Denver hell be glad to take it for yu Miss Nora Hes real
obliging offered Mac generously

Ive been in the house all day so I need a walk I thought perhaps one
of you gentlemen Miss Nora looked from one to the other of them with
deep innocence

Sure Ill go along and carry it Just as Mac says Ill be real
pleased to go said Denver hastily

Mac felt he had been a trifle precipitate in his assumption that Nora
did not intend to go herself Lee Ming had established a laundry
some half mile from the ranch and the way thereto lay through most
picturesque shadow and moonlight The foreman had conscientious scruples
against letting Denver escort her down such a veritable lovers lane of
romantic scenery

I dont know as yu ought to go out in the night air with that cold
Denver Id hate a heap to have yu catch pneumony It dont seem to me
Id be justified in allowin yu to said the foreman anxiously

Youre THAT thoughtful Mac But I expect mebbe a little saunter with
Miss Nora will do my throat good Well walk real slow sos not to wear
out my strength

Big husky fellows like yu are awful likely to drop off with pneumony
I been thinkin I got some awful good medicine that would be the right
stuff for yu Its in the drawer of my washstand Help yourself
liberal and it will surely do yu good Yull find it in a bottle

Ill bet its good medicine Mac After we get home Ill drop around
In the washstand yu said

I hate to have yu take such a risk Mac tried again There aint a
bit of use in yu exposing yourself so careless Yu take a hot footbath
and some of that medicine Denver then go right straight to bed and in
the moning yull be good as new Honest yu wont know yourself

Yu got the best heart Mac Nora giggled

Since Im foreman I got to be a mother to yu boys aint I

Yure liable to be a grandmother to us if yu keep on came back the
young giant

Yu plumb discourage me Denver sighed the foreman

No sir The way I look at it a fellows got to take some risk Now
yu caynt tell some things I figure I aint half so likely to catch
pneumony as yu would be to get heart trouble if yu went walking with
Miss Nora returned Denver

A perfect gravity sat on both their faces during the progress of most of
their repartee

If your throats so bad Mr Halliday Ill put a kerosene rag round
it for you when we get back Nora said with a sweet little glance of
sympathy that the foreman did not enjoy

Denver otherwise Mr Halliday beamed Yure real kind maam
Ill bet that will help it on the outside much as Macs medicine will
inside

Whatll yu do for my heart maam if it gits bad the way Denver
figures it will

Yu might try a mustard plaster she gurgled with laughter

For once the debonair foremans ready tongue had brought him to defeat
He was about to retire from the field temporarily when Nora herself
offered first aid to the wounded

We would like to have you come along with us Mr McWilliams I want
you to come if you can spare the time

The soft eyes telegraphed an invitation with such a subtle suggestion of
a private understanding that Mac was instantly encouraged to accept

He knew of course that she was playing them against each other and
sitting back to enjoy the result but he was possessed of the hope
common to youths in his case that he really was on a better footing with
her than the other boys This opinion it may be added was shared by
Denver Frisco and even Reddy as regards themselves Which is merely
another way of putting the regrettable fact that this very charming
young woman was given to coquetting with the hearts of her admirers

Any time yu get oneasy about that cough yu go right on home Denver
Dont stay jest out of politeness Well never miss yu anyhow the
foreman assured him

Thank yu Mac But yu see I got to stay to keep Miss Nora from
getting bored

Was it a phrenologist strung yu with the notion yu was a cure for
lonesomeness

Shucks I dont make no such claims The only thing is its a comfort
when youre bored to have company Miss Nora shes so polite But yu
see if Im along I can take yu for a walk when yu get too bad

They reached the little trail that ran up to Lee Mings place and
Denver suggested that Mac run in with the bundle so as to save Nora the
climb

Id like to honest I would But since yu thought of it first I wont
steal the credit of doing Miss Nora a good turn Well wait right here
for yu till yu come back

Well all go up together decided Nora and honors were easy

In the pleasant moonlight they sauntered back two of them still engaged
in lively badinage while the third played chorus with appreciative
little giggles and murmurs of Oh Mr Halliday and You know youre
just flattering me Mr McWilliams

If they had not been so absorbed in their gay foolishness the two men
might not have walked so innocently into the trap waiting for them
at their journeys end As it was the first intimation they had of
anything unusual was a stern command to surrender

Throw up your hands Quick you blank fools

A masked man covered them in each hand a sixshooter and at his
summons the arms of the cowpunchers went instantly into the air

Nora gave an involuntary little scream of dismay

Yu dont need to be afraid lady Aint nobody going to hurt you I
reckon the masked man growled

Sure they wont Mac reassured her adding ironically This
gunplay business is just neighborly frolic Liable to happen any day in
Wyoming

A second masked man stepped up He too was garnished with an arsenal

Whats all this talking about he demanded sharply

We just been having a little conversation seh returned McWilliams
gently his vigilant eyes searching through the disguise of the other
Just been telling the lady that your call is in friendly spirit No
objections I suppose

The swarthy newcomer who seemed to be in command swore sourly

Yu put a knot in your tongue Mr Foreman

Cetainly if yu prefer returned the indomitable McWilliams

Shut up or Ill pump lead into you

Im padlocked seh

Nora Darling interrupted the dialogue by quietly fainting The foreman
caught her as she fell

See what yu done yu blamed chump he snapped



CHAPTER 13 THE TWO COUSINS

The sheepman lay at his ease the strong supple lines of him stretched
lazily on the lounge Helen was sitting beside him in an easy chair and
he watched the play of her face in the lamplight as she read from The
Little White Bird She was very good to see so vitally alive and full
of a sweet charm that half revealed and half concealed her personality
The imagination with which she threw herself into a discussion of the
child fancies portrayed by the Scotch writer captured his fancy It
delighted him to tempt her into discussions that told him by suggestion
something of what she thought and was

They were in animated debate when the door opened to admit somebody
else He had stepped in so quietly that he stood there a little while
without being observed smiling down at them with triumphant malice
behind the mask he wore Perhaps it was the black visor that was
responsible for the Mephisto effect since it hid all the face but the
leering eyes These narrowed to slits swept the room and came back to
its occupants He was a tall man and wellknit dressed incongruously in
uptodate riding breeches and boots in combination with the usual gray
shirt knotted kerchief and widebrimmed felt hat of the horseman of the
plains The dust of the desert lay thick on him without in the least
obscuring a certain ribald elegance a distinction of wickedness
that rested upon him as his due To this result his debonair manner
contributed though it carried with it no suggestion of weakness To the
girl who looked up and found him there he looked indescribably sinister

She half rose to her feet dilated eyes fixed on him

Good evenin I came to make sure yu got safe home Miss Messiter he
said

The eyes of the two men clashed the sheepmans stern and unyielding
his cousins lit with the devil of triumph But out of the faces of both
men looked the inevitable conflict the declaration of war that never
ends till death

Ive been a heap anxious about yucouldnt sleep for worrying So I
saddled up and rode in to find out if yu were all right and to inquire
how Cousin Ned was getting along

The sheepman not deigning to move an inch from his position looked in
silence his steady contempt

This conversation sounds a whole lot like a monologue up to date he
continued Now maybe yu dont know yu have the honor of entertaining
the King of the Bighorn The mans brown hand brushed the mask from his
eyes and he bowed with mocking deference Miss Messiter allow me to
introduce myself againNed Bannister train robber rustler kidnapper
and general bad man But I aint told yu the worst yet Im cousin to a
sheepherder and thats the lowest thing that walks

He limped forward a few steps and sat down Thank you I believe I will
stay a while since yu both ask me so urgent It isnt often I meet with
a welcome so hearty and straight from the heart

It was not hard to see how the likeness between them contributed to
the mistake that had been current concerning them Side by side no
man could have mistaken one for the other The color of their eyes
the shade of hair even the cut of their features were different But
beneath all distinctions in detail ran a family resemblance not to be
denied This man looked like his cousin the sheepman as the latter
might have done if all his life he had given a free rein to evil
passions

The height the build the elastic tread of each made further
contributions to this effect of similarity

What are you doing here They were the first words spoken by the man
on the lounge and they rang with a curt challenge

Come to inquire after the health of my dear cousin came the prompt
silken answer

You villain

My dear cousin yu speak with such conviction that yu almost persuade
me But of course if Im a villain Ive got to live up to my reputation
Havent I Miss Messiter

Wouldnt it be better to live it down she asked with a quietness
that belied her terror For there had been in his manner a threat
not against her but against the man whom her heart acknowledged as her
lover

He laughed Yure still hoping to make a Sunday school superintendent
out of me I see Yu havent forgot all your schoolmarm ways yet but
Ill teach yu to forget them

The other cousin watched him with a cool quiet glance that never
wavered The outlaw was heavily armed but his weapons were sheathed
and though there was a wary glitter behind the vindictive exultation
in his eyes his capable hands betrayed no knowledge of the existence of
his revolvers It was he knew to be a moral victory if one at all

Hope Im not disturbing any happy family circle he remarked and
taking two limping steps forward he lifted the book from the girls
unresisting hands Hm Barrie I dont go much on him Hes too
sissy for me But I could have guessed the other Ned Bannister would
be reading something like that he concluded a flicker of sneering
contempt crossing his face

Perhaps yull learn some time to attend to your own business said
the man on the couch quietly

Hatred gleamed in the narrowed slits from which the soul of the other
cousin looked down at him Im a philanthropist and my business is
attending to other peoples They raise sheep for instance and I
market them

The girl hastily interrupted She had not feared for herself but she
knew fear for the indomitable man she had nursed back to life Wont
you sit down Mr Bannister Since you dont approve our literature
perhaps we can find some other diversion more to your taste She smiled
faintly

The man turned in smiling divination of her purpose and sat down to
play with her as a cat does with a mouse

Thank yu Miss Messiter I believe I will I called to thank yu for
your kindness to my cousin as well as to inquire about you The word
goes that yu pulled my dear cousin back when death was reaching mighty
strong for him Of course I feel grateful to yu How is he getting
along now

Hes doing very well I think

Thats cetainly good hearing was his ironical response How come he
to get hurt did yu say

His sleek smile was a thing hateful to see

A hound bit me explained the sheepman

Yu dont say I reckon yu oughtnt to have got in its way Did yu
kill it

Not yet

That was surely a mistake for its liable to bite again

The girl felt a sudden sickness at his honeyed cruelty but immediately
pulled herself together For whatever fiendish intention might be in his
mind she meant to frustrate it

I hear you are of a musical turn Mr Bannister Wont you play for
us

She had by chance found his weak spot Instantly his eyes lit up He
stepped across to the piano and began to look over the music though not
so intently that he forgot to keep under his eye the man on the lounge

Hm Mozart Grieg Chopin Raff Beethoven Yu cetainly have the
music here I wonder if yu have the musician He looked her over with
a bold unscrupulous gaze Its an old trick to have classical music on
the rack and ragtime in your soul Can yu play these

You will have to be the judge of that she said

He selected two of Griegs songs and invited her to the piano He knew
instantly that the Norwegians delicate fancy and lyrical feeling had
found in her no inadequate medium of expression The peculiar emotional
quality of the song I Love Thee seemed to fill the room as she played
When she swung round on the stool at its conclusion it was to meet a
shiningeyed musical enthusiast instead of the villain she had left
five minutes earlier

Yu CAN play was all he said but the manner of it spoke volumes

For nearly an hour he kept her at the piano and when at last he let her
stop playing he seemed a man transformed

You have given me a great pleasure a very great pleasure Miss
Messiter he thanked her warmly his Western idiom sloughed with his
villainy for the moment It has been a good many months since I have
heard any decent music With your permission I shall come again

Her hesitation was imperceptible Surely if you wish She felt it
would be worse than idle to deny the permission she might not be able to
refuse

With perfect grace he bowed and as he wheeled away met with a little
shock of remembrance the gaze of his cousin For a long moment their
eyes bored into each other Neither yielded the beat of an eyelid but
it was the outlaw that spoke

I had forgotten yu Thats strange too because it was for yu I came
Im going to take yu home with me

Alive or dead asked the other serenely

Alive dear Ned

Same old traits cropping out again There was always something feline
about yu I remember when yu were a boy yu liked to torment wild
animals yu had trapped

I play with larger game nowand find it more interesting

Just so Miss Messiter I shall have to borrow a pony from yu
unless He broke off and turned indifferently to the bandit

Yes I brought a hawss along with me for yu replied the other to the
unvoiced question I thought maybe yu might want to ride with us

But he cant ride He couldnt possibly It would kill him the girl
broke out

I reckon not The man from the Shoshones glanced at his victim as he
drew on his gauntlets Hes a heap tougher than yu think

But it will If he should ride now whyIt would be the same as
murder she gasped You wouldnt make him ride now

Didnt yu hear him order his hawss maam Hes keen on this ride
Of course he dont have to go unless he wants to The man turned his
villainous smile on his cousin and the latter interpreted it to mean
that if he preferred the point of attack might be shifted to the girl
He might go or he might stay But if he stayed the mistress of the Lazy
D would have to pay for his decision

No Ill ride he said at once

Helen Messiter had missed the meaning of that Marconied message that
flashed between them She set her jaw with decision Well youll not
Its perfectly ridiculous I wont hear of such a thing

Yu seem right welcome Hadnt yu better stay Ned murmured the
outlaw with smiling eyes that mocked

Of course he had He couldnt ride a milenot half a mile The idea is
utterly preposterous

The sheepman got to his feet unsteadily Ill do famously

I wont have it Why are you so foolish about going He said you didnt
need to go You cant ride any more than a baby could chop down that
pine in the yard

Im a heap stronger than yu think

Yes you are she derided Its nothing but obstinacy Make him
stay she appealed to the outlaw

Am I my cousins keeper he drawled I can advise him to stay but I
cant make him

Well I can Im his nurse and I say he shant stir a foot out of
this housenot a foot

The wounded man smiled quietly admiring the splendid energy of her
Im right sorry to leave yu so unceremoniously

Youre not going She wheeled on the outlaw I dont understand this
at all But if you want him you can find him here when you come again
Put him on parole and leave him here Ill not be a party to murder by
letting him go

Yu think Im going to murder him he smiled

I think he cannot stand the riding It would kill him

A haidstrong man is bound to have his way He seems hellbent on
riding All the docs say the outside of a hawss is good for the inside
of a man Mebbe itll be the making of him

I wont have it Ill rouse the whole countryside against you Why
dont you parole him till he is better

All right Well leave it that way announced the man Id hate to
hurt your tender feelings after such a pleasant evening Let him give
his parole to come to me whenever I send for him no matter where he
may be to quit whatever he is doing right that instant and come on the
jump If he wants to leave it that way well call it a bargain

Again the rapierthrust of their eyes crossed The sheepman was
satisfied with what he saw in the face of his foe

All right Its a deal he agreed and sank weakly back to the couch

There are men whose looks are a profanation to any good woman Ned
Bannister of the Shoshones was one of them He looked at his cousin
and his ribald eyes coasted back to bold scrutiny of this young womans
charming buoyant youth There was Something in his face that sent a
flush of shame coursing through her rich blood No man had ever looked
at her like that before

Take awful good care of him he sneered with so plain an implication
of evil that her clean blood boiled But I know yu will and dont let
him go before hes real strong

No she murmured hating herself for the flush that bathed her

He bowed like a Chesterfield and went out with elastic heels spurs
clicking

Helen turned fiercely on her guest Why did you make me insist on
your staying As if I want you here as if She stopped choking with
anger presently flamed out I hate you and ran from the room to hide
herself alone with her tears and her shame



CHAPTER 14 FOR THE WORLDS CHAMPIONSHIP

The scene on which Helen Messiters eyes rested that mellow Fourth of
July was vivid enough to have interested a far more jaded mind than
hers Nowhere outside of Cattleland could it have been duplicated
Wyoming is sparsely populated but the riders of the plains think
nothing of traveling a hundred miles in the saddle to be present at a
broncobusting contest Large delegations too had come in by railroad
from Caspar Billings Sheridan Cheyenne and a score of other points
so that the amphitheatre that looked down on the arena was filled to its
capacity

All night the little town had rioted with its guests Everything was
wide open at Gimlet Butte Saloons were doing a landoffice business and
gamblinghouses coining money Great piles of gold had passed to and fro
during the night at the roulette wheel and the faro table But with the
coming of day interest had centered on the roughriding contest for the
worlds championship Saloons and dance halls were deserted and the
universal trend of travel had been toward the big grand stands from
which the sport could be best viewed

It was afternoon now The preliminaries had been ridden and half a
dozen of the best riders had been chosen by the judges to ride again
for the finals Helen was wonderfully interested because in the six who
were to ride again were included the two Bannister cousins her foreman
McWilliams the young man Texas whom she had met the day of her
arrival at Gimlet Butte and Tom Sanford who had last year won the
championship

She looked down on the arena and her heart throbbed with the pure
joy of life Already she loved her West and its picturesque chapclad
population Their jingling spurs and their colored kerchiefs knotted
round sunburned necks their frank wholehearted abandon to the
interest of the moment led her to regard these youths as schoolboys
Yet they were a hardbitten lot as one could see burned to a brickred
by the untempered sun of the Rockies with muscles knit like steel
and hearts toughened to endure any blizzard they might meet Only the
humorous wrinkles about the corners of their eyes gave them away for the
cheerful sons of mirth that they were

Bob Austin on TwoStep announced the megaphone man and a little stir
eddied through the group gathered at the lane between the arena and the
corral

A meeklooking buckskin was driven into the arena The embodiment of
listlessness it apparently had not ambition enough to flick a fly from
its flank with its tail Suddenly the broncos ears pricked its sharp
eyes dilated A man was riding forward the loop of a lariat circling
about his head The rope fell true but the wily pony sidestepped and
the loop slithered to the ground Again the rope shot forward dropped
over the ponys head and tightened The ropers mustang braced its
forefeet and brought the buckskin up short Another rope swept over its
head It stood trembling unable to move without strangling itself

A picturesque youth in flannel shirt and chaps came forward dragging
blanket saddle and bridle At sight of him the horse gave a spasmodic
fling then trembled again violently A blind was coaxed over its eyes
and the bridle slipped on Quickly and warily with deft fingers the
young man saddled and cinched He waved a hand jauntily to the ropers
The lariats were thrown off as the puncher swung to the saddle For an
instant the buckskin stood bewildered motionless as a statue There was
a sudden leap forward high in air and Bob Austin alias Texas swung
his sombrero with a joyous whoop

Fan him Fan him screamed the spectators and the riders quirt went
up and down like a pistonrod

Round and round went TwoStep in a vicious circle swapping ends with
dizzying rapidity Suddenly he went forward as from a catapult and came
to sudden halt in about five seconds But Texass knees still clung
viselike to the sides of the pony A series of quick bucks followed
the buckskin coming down with back humped all four legs stiff as iron
posts The jar on the rider would have been like a piledriver falling
on his head had he not let himself grow limp The buckskin plunged
forward again in frenzied leaps ending in an unexpected jump to one
side Alas for Texas One moment he was jubilantly plying quirt and
spurs the next he found himself pitching sideways To save himself he
caught at the saddlehorn

Hes hunting leather shouted a hundred voices

One of the judges rode out and waved a hand Texas slipped to the ground
disqualified and made his dejected way back to his deriding comrades
Some of them had endured similar misfortunes earlier in the day
Therefore they found much pleasure in condoling with him

If hed only recollected to saw off the horn of his saddle then
he couldnt a found it when he went to hunt leather mournfully
commented one puncher in a shirt of robins egg blue

Twould have been most as good as to take the dust wouldnt it
retorted Texas gently and the laugh was on the gentleman in blue
because he had been thrown earlier in the day

A fellows hands sure get in his way sometimes I reckon if youd tied
your hands Tex youd been riding that rockinghawss yet suggested
Denver amiably

Sometimes its his foot he puts in it There was onct a gent
disqualified for riding on his spurs said Texas reminiscently

At which hit Denver retired for not three hours before he had been
detected digging his spurs into the cinch to help him stick to the
saddle

Jim McWilliams will ride Dead Easy came the announcement through the
megaphone and a burst of cheering passed along the grand stand for the
sunny smile of the foreman of the Lazy D made him a general favorite
Helen leaned forward and whispered something gaily to Nora who sat in
the seat in front of her The Irish girl laughed and blushed but when
her mistress looked up it was her turn to feel the mounting color creep
into her cheeks For Ned Bannister arrayed in all his riding finery
was making his way along the aisle to her

She had not seen him since he had ridden away from the Lazy D ten days
before quite sufficiently recovered from his wounds to take up the
routine of life again They had parted not the best of friends for she
had not yet forgiven him for his determination to leave with his cousin
on the night that she had been forced to insist on his remaining He had
put her in a false position and he had never explained to her why Nor
could she guess the reasonfor he was not a man to harvest credit for
himself by explaining his own chivalry

Since her heart told her how glad she was he had come to her box to see
her she greeted him with the coolest little nod in the world

Good morning Miss Messiter May I sit beside yu he asked

Oh certainly She swept her skirts aside carelessly and made room for
him I thought you were going to ride soon

No I ride last except for Sanford the champion My cousin rides just
before me Hes entered under the name of Jack Holloway

She was thinking that he had no business to be riding that his wounds
were still too fresh but she did not intend again to show interest
enough in his affairs to interfere even by suggestion Her heart had
been in her mouth every moment of the time this morning while he had
been tossed hither and thither on the back of his mount In his delirium
he had said he loved her If he did why should he torture her so It
was well enough for sound men to risk their lives but

A cheer swelled in the grand stand and died breathlessly away
McWilliams was setting a pace it would take a rare expert to equal He
was a trick rider and all the spectacular feats that appealed to the
onlooker were his While his horse was wildly pitching he drank a
bottle of pop and tossed the bottle away With the reins in his teeth
he slipped off his coat and vest and concluded a splendid exhibition of
skill by riding with his feet out of the stirrups He had been smoking a
cigar when he mounted Except while he had been drinking the pop it had
been in his mouth from beginning to end and after he had vaulted from
the ponys back he deliberately puffed a long smokespiral into the
air to show that his cigar was still alight No previous rider had
earned so spontaneous a burst of applause Hes cetainly a pure when
it comes to riding acknowledged Bannister I look to see him get
either first or second

Whom do you think is his most dangerous rival Helen asked

My cousin is a straightup rider too Hes more graceful than Mac I
think but not quite so good on tricks It will be nip and tuck

How about your cousins cousin she asked with bold irony

He hopes he wont have to take the dust was his laughing answer

The next rider suffered defeat irrevocably before he had been thirty
seconds in the saddle His mount was one of the most cunning of the
outlaw ponies of the Northwest and it brought him to grief by jamming
his leg hard against the fence He tried in vain to spur the bronco into
the middle of the arena but after it drove at a post for the third time
and ground his limb against it he gave up to the pain and slipped off

That isnt fair is it Helen asked of the young man sitting beside
her

He shrugged his lean broad shoulders He should have known how to keep
the horse in the open Mac would never have been caught that way

Jack Holloway on Rocking Horse the announcer shouted

It took four men and two lariats to subdue this horse to a condition
sufficiently tame to permit of a saddle being slipped on Even then this
could not be accomplished without throwing the bronco first The result
was that all the spirit was taken out of the animal by the preliminary
ordeal so that when the man from the Shoshone country mounted his
steed was too jaded to attempt resistance

Thumb him Thumb him the audience cried referring to the cowboy
trick of running the thumbs along a certain place in the shoulder to
stir the anger of the bucker

But the rider slipped off with disgust Give me another horse he
demanded and after a minutes consultation among the judges a second
pony was driven out from the corral This one proved to be a Tartar It
went off in a frenzy of pitching the moment its rider dropped into the
saddle

Yull go a long way before you see better ridin than his and Macs
Notice how he gives to its pitching said Bannister as he watched his
cousins perfect ease in the cyclone of which he was the center

I expect it depends on the kind of a hawss she mocked Hes riding
well isnt he

I dont know any that ride better

The horse put up a superb fight trying everything it knew to unseat
this demon clamped to its back It possessed in combination all the
worst vices was a weaver a sunfisher and a fencerower and never
had it tried so desperately to maintain its record of never having
been ridden But the outlaw in the saddle was too much for the outlaw
underneath He was master just as he was first among the ruffians whom
he led because there was in him a redhot devil of wickedness that
would brook no rival

The furious bronco surrendered without an instants warning and its
rider slipped at once to the ground As he sauntered through the dust
toward the grand stand Helen could not fail to see how his vanity
sunned itself in the applause that met his performance His equipment
was perfect to the least detail The reflection from a ladys
lookingglass was no brighter than the silver spurs he jingled on his
sprightly heels Strikingly handsome in a dark sinister way one would
say at first sight and later would chafe at the justice of a verdict
not to be denied

Ned Bannister rose from his seat beside Helen Wish me luck he said
with his gay smile

I wish you all the luck you deserve she answered

Oh wish me more than that if yu want me to win

I didnt say I wanted you to win You take the most unaccountable
things for granted

Ive a good mind to win then just to spite yu he laughed

As if you could she mocked but her voice took a softer intonation as
she called after him in a low murmur Be careful please

His white teeth flashed a smile of reassurance at her Ive never been
killed yet

Ned Bannister on Steamboat sang out the megaphone man

Im cetainly in luck Steamboats the worst hawss on the range he
told himself as he strode down the grand stand to enter the arena

The announcement of his name created for the second time that day a stir
of unusual interest Everybody in that large audience had heard of Ned
Bannister knew of his record as a bad man and his prowess as the king
of the Shoshone country suspected him of being a train and bank robber
as well as a rustler That he should have the boldness to enter the
contest in his own name seemed to show how defiant he was of the public
sentiment against him and how secure he counted himself in flaunting
this contempt As for the sheepman the notoriety that his cousins
odorous reputation had thrust upon him was extremely distasteful as well
as dangerous but he had done nothing to disgrace his name and he meant
to use it openly He could almost catch the low whispers that passed
from mouth to mouth about him

Aint it a shame that a fellow like that leader of all the criminals
that hide in the mountains can show himself openly before ten thousand
honest folks That he knew to be the purport of their whispering and
along with it went a recital of the crimes he had committed How he
was a noted waddy or cattlerustler how he and his gang had held
up three trains in eighteen months how he had killed Tom Mooney Bob
Carney and several othersthese were the sorts of things that were
being said about him and from the bottom of his soul he resented his
impotency to clear his name

There was something in Bannisters riding that caught Helens fancy at
once It was the unconscious grace of the man the ease with which he
seemed to make himself a very part of the horse He attempted no tricks
rode without any flourishes But the perfect poise of his lithe body as
it gave with the motions of the horse proclaimed him a born rider so
finished indeed that his very ease seemed to discount the performance
Steamboat had a malevolent red eye that glared hatred at the oppressor
man and today it lived up to its reputation of being the most vicious
and untamed animal on the frontier But though it did its best to
unseat the rider and trample him underfoot there was no moment when the
issue seemed in doubt save once The horse flung itself backward in a
somersault risking its own neck in order to break its masters But
he was equal to the occasion and when Steamboat staggered again to its
feet Bannister was still in the saddle It was a daring and magnificent
piece of horsemanship and though he was supposed to be a desperado
and a ruffian his achievement met with a breathless gasp followed by
thunderous applause

The battle between horse and man was on again for the animal was as
strong almost in courage as the rider But Steamboats confidence had
been shaken as well as its strength Its efforts grew less cyclonic
Foam covered its mouth and flecked its sides The pitches were easy to
foresee and meet Presently they ceased altogether

Bannister slid from the saddle and swayed unsteadily across the arena
The emergency past he had scarce an ounce of force left in him Jim
McWilliams ran out and slipped an arm around his shoulders regardless
of what his friends might think of him for it

Youre all in old man Yu hadnt ought to have ridden even though
yu did skin us all to a finish

Nonsense Mac First place goes to yu oror Jack Holloway

Not unless the judges are blind

But Bannisters prediction proved true The champion Sanford had been
traveling with a Wild West show and was far too soft to compete with
these lusty cowboys who had kept hard from their daily life on the
plains Before he had ridden three minutes it was apparent that he stood
no chance of retaining his title so that the decision narrowed itself
to an issue between the two Bannisters and McWilliams First place was
awarded to the latter the second prize to Jack Holloway and the third
to Ned Bannister

But nearly everybody in the grand stand knew that Bannister had been
discriminated against because of his unpopularity The judges were
not local men and had nothing to fear from the outlaw Therefore they
penalized him on account of his reputation It would never do for
the Associated Press dispatches to send word all over the East that a
murderous desperado was permitted unmolested to walk away with the
championship belt

It aint a square deal declared McWilliams promptly

He was sitting beside Nora and he turned round to express his opinion
to the two sitting behind him in the box

Well not go behind the returns Yu won fairly I congratulate
yu Mr Championoftheworld replied the sheepman shaking hands
cordially

I told you to bring that belt to the Lazy D smiled his mistress as
she shook hands

But in her heart she was crying out that it was an outrage



CHAPTER 15 JUDD MORGAN PASSES

Gimlet Butte devoted the night of the Fourth to a high old time The
roping and the other sports were to be on the morrow and meanwhile the
night hours were filled with exuberance The cowboys spree comes
only once in several months but when it does come he enters into the
occasion with such wholehearted enthusiasm as to make up swiftly for
lost time A traveling midway had cast its tents in a vacant square in
competition with the regular attractions of the town and everywhere the
hardriding punchers were night herding in full regalia

There was a big masked ball in the street and another in the Masonic
Hall while here and there flared the lights of the faker with something
to sell Among these last was Soapy Sothern doing a thriving business
in selling suckers and bars wrapped with greenbacks Crowds tramped the
streets blowing horns and throwing confetti and everywhere was a large
sprinkling of men in highheeled boots swinging along with the awkward
stifflegged gait of the cowboy Sometimes a girl was hanging on his
arm and again he was whooping it up with the boys but in either case
the rangeriders savings were burning a hole through his pockets with
extreme rapidity

Jim McWilliams and the sheepman Bannister had that day sealed a
friendship that was to be as enduring as life The owner of the sheep
ranch was already under heavy obligation to the foreman of the Lazy D
but debt alone is not enough on which to found soul brotherhood There
must be qualities of kinship in the primeval elements of character Both
men had suspected that this kinship existed but today they had proved
it in the way that one had lost and the other had won the coveted
championship They had made no vows and no professions The subject had
not even been touched in words a meeting of the eyes followed by the
handshake with which Bannister had congratulated the winner That had
been all But it was enough

With the casual democracy of the frontier they had together escorted
Helen Messiter and Nora Darling through a riotous three hours of
carnival taking care to get them back to their hotel before the night
really began to howl

But after they had left the young women neither of them cared to sleep
yet They were still in costume Mac dressed as a monk and his friend
as a Stuart cavalier and the spirit of frolic was yet strong in them

I expaict mebbe we better hunt in couples if were going to help
paint the town smiled Mac and his friend had immediately agreed

It must have been well after midnight that they found themselves
bucking the tiger in a combination saloon and gamblinghouse whose
patrons were decidedly cosmopolitan in character Here white and red
and yellow men played side by side the Orient and the Occident and
the aboriginal alike intent on the falling cards and the little rolling
ball A good many of them were still in their masks and dominos though
these for the most part removed their vizors before playing

Neither McWilliams nor his friend were betting high and the luck had
been so even that at the end of two hours play neither of them had at
any time either won or lost more than fifteen dollars In point of fact
they were playing not so much to win as just to keep in touch with the
gay youthful humor of the night

They were getting tired of the game when two men jingled in for a drink
They were talking loudly together and it was impossible to miss the
subject of their conversation

McWilliams gave a little jerk of his head toward one of them Judd
Morgan his lips framed without making a sound

Bannister nodded

Been tanking up all day Mac added Otherwise his tongue would not be
shooting off so reckless

A silence had fallen over the assembly save for the braggarts at the
bar Men looked at each other and then furtively at Bannister For
Morgan ignorant of who was sitting quietly with his back to him at the
farotable was venting his hate of Bannister and McWilliams

Both in the same boat Did yu see how Mac ran to help him today Both
waddies Both rustlers Both train robbers Sho I got through putting
a padlock on me mouth Man to man Im as good as either of themdamn
sight better I wisht they was here one or both I wisht they would
step up here and fight it out Bannisters a false alarm and that
foreman of the Lazy D His tongue stumbled over a blur of vilification
that ended with a foul mention of Miss Messiter

Instantly two chairs crashed to the floor Two pair of gray eyes met
quietly

My quarrel Bann said Jim in a low even voice

The other nodded Ill see yu have a clear field

The man who was with Morgan suddenly whispered in his ear and the
latter slewed his head in startled fear Almost instantly a bullet
clipped past McWilliamss shoulder Morgan had fired without waiting
for the challenge he felt sure was at hand Oncetwice the foremans
revolver made answer Morgan staggered slipped down to the floor a
bullet crashing through the chandelier as he fell For a moment his body
jerked Then he rolled over and lay still

The foremans weapon covered him unwaveringly but no more steadily than
Bannisters gaze the man who had come in with him who lay lifeless on
the floor The man looked at the lifeless thing shuddered and backed
out of the saloon

I call yu all to witness that my friend killed him in selfdefense
said Bannister evenly Yu all saw him fire first Mac did not even
have his gun out

Thats right agreed one and another added He got what was coming
to him

He sure did was the barkeepers indorsement He came in hunting
trouble but I reckon he didnt want to be accommodated so prompt

Yull find us at the Gimlet Butte House if were wanted for this
said Bannister Well be there till morning

But once out of the gamblinghouse McWilliams drew his friend to one
side Do yu know who that was I killed

Judd Morgan foreman before yu at the Lazy D

Yes but what else

What do yu mean

I mean that next to your cousin Judd was leader of that ShoshoneTeton
bunch

How do yu know

I suspected it a long time but I knew for sure the day that your
cousin held up the ranch The man that was in charge of the crowd
outside was Morgan I could swear to it I knew him soon as I clapped
eyes to him but I was awful careful to forget to tell him I recognized
him

That means we are in more serious trouble than I had supposed

Yu bet it does Were in a hell of a hole figure it out any way
yu like Instead of having shot up a casual idiot Ive killed Ned
Bannisters righthand man That will be the excuseshooting Morgan
But the real trouble is that I won the championship belt from your
cousin He already hated yu like poison and he dont love me any too
hard He will have us arrested by his sheriff here Catch the point
YURE NED BANNISTER THE OUTLAW AND IM HIS RIGHTBOWER Thats the
play hes going to make and hes going to make it right soon

I dont care if he does Well fight him on his own ground Well prove
that hes the miscreant and not us

Prove nothing snarled McWilliams Do yu reckon hell give us a
chance to prove a thing Not on your life Hell have us jailed first
thing then hell stir up a sentiment against us and before morning
there will be a lynchingbee and yu and I will wear the neckties How
do yu like the looks of it

But yu have a lot of friends They wont stand for anything like
that

Not if they had time to stop it Trouble is fellows friends think
awful slow Theyll arrive in time to cut us down and be the mourners
No sir Its a hike for Jimmie Mac on the back of the first bronc he
can slap a saddle on

Bannister frowned I dont like to run before the scurvy scoundrels

Do yu suppose Im enjoying it Not to any extent I allow But that
sweet relative of yours holds every ace in the deck and hell play
them too He owns the law in this mans town and he owns the lawless
But the best card he holds is that he can get a thousand of the best
people here to join him in hanging the king of the Shoshone outlaws
Explanations nothing Yu rode under the name of Bannister didnt yu
Hes Jack Holloway

It does make a strong combination admitted the sheepman

Strong Its invincible I can see him playing it laughing up his
sleeve all the time at the honest fools he is working No sir I draw
out of a game like that Yu dont get a run for your money

Of course he knows already what has happened mused Bannister

Sure he knows That fellow with Morgan made a beeline for him Just
about now hes routing the sheriff out of his bed We got no time to
lose Thing is to burn the wind out of this town while we have the
chance

I see It wont help us any to be spilling lead into a sheriffs posse
That would cetainly put us in the wrong

Now yure shouting If were honest men why dont we surrender
peaceable Thats the play the king is going to make in this town Now
if we should spoil a posse and bump off one or two of them we couldnt
pile up evidence enough to get a jury to acquit No sir We cant
surrender and we cant fight Consequence is we got to roll our tails
immediate

We have an appointment with Miss Messiter and Nora for tomorrow
morning Well have to leave word we cant keep it

Sure Denver and Missou are playing the wheel down at the Silver
Dollar I reckon we better make those boys jump and run errands for us
while we lie low Ill drop in casual and give them the word Meet yu
here in ten minutes Whatever yu do keep that mask on your face

Better meet farther from the scene of trouble Suppose we say the north
gate of the grand stand

Good enough Solong

The first faint streaks of day were beginning to show on the horizon
when Bannister reached the grand stand He knew that inside of another
halfhour the little frontier town would be blinking in the early
morning sunlight that falls so brilliantly through the limpid
atmosphere If they were going to leave without fighting their way out
there was no time to lose

Ten minutes slowly ticked away

He glanced at his watch Five minutes after four I wish I had gone
with Mac He may have been recognized

But even as the thought flitted through his mind the semidarkness
opened to let a figure out of it

All quiet along the Potomac seh asked the foremans blithe voice
Good I found the boys and got them started He flung down a Mexican
vaqueros gaily trimmed costume

Get into these seh Denver shucked them for me That coyote must have
noticed what we wore before he slid out Yu can bet the orders are to
watch for us as we were dressed then

What are y u going to do

Me Im scheduled to be Aaron Burr seh Missou swaps with me when he
gets back here Theyre going to rustle us some white mens clothes
too but we caynt wear them till we get out of town on account of
showing our handsome faces

What about horses

Denver is rustling some for us Yu better be scribbling your billydoo
to the girl yu leave behind yu seh

Havent yu got one to scribble Bannister retorted Seems to me yu
better get busy too

So it happened that when Missou arrived a few minutes later he found
this pair of gentlemen who were about to flee for their lives busily
inditing what McWilliams had termed facetiously billetsdoux Each
of them was trying to make his letter a little warmer than friendship
allowed without committing himself to any chance of a rebuff Mac got as
far as Nora Darling absentmindedly inserted a comma between the words
and there stuck hopelessly He looked enviously across at Bannister
whose pencil was traveling rapidly down his notebook

My what a swift trail your pencil leaves on that paper Thats going
some Mines bogged down before it got started I wisht yu would start
me off

Well if you aint up and started a business college already I had
ought to have brought a typewriter along with me murmured Missou
ironically

How are things stacking Our friends the enemy getting busy yet asked
Bannister folding and addressing his note

Thats what Orders gone out to guard every road so as not to let you
pass Whats the matter with me rustling up the boys and us holding down
a corner of this town ourselves

The sheepman shook his head Were not going to start a little private
war of our own We couldnt do that without spilling a lot of blood No
well make a run for it

That yu Denver the foreman called softly as the sound of
approaching horses reached him

Bet your life Got your own broncs too Sheriff Burns called up
Daniels not to let any horses go out from his corral to anybody without
his OK I happened to be cinching at the time the phone message
came so I concluded that order wasnt for me and lit out kinder
unceremonious

Hastily the fugitives donned the new costumes and dominos turned their
notes over to Denver and swung to their saddles

Good luck the punchers called after them and Denver added an
ironical promise that the foreman had no doubt he would keep Ill look
out for NoraDarling There was a drawling pause between the first and
second names Ill cetainly see that she dont have any time to worry
about yu Mac

Yu go to Halifax returned Mac genially over his shoulder as he loped
away

I doubt if we can get out by the roads Soon as we reach the end of the
street we better cut across that hayfield suggested Ned

Thats whatever Then well slip past the sentries without being seen
Id hate to spoil any of them if we can help it Were liable to get
ourselves disliked if our guns spatter too much

They rode through the main street still noisy with the shouts of late
revelers returning to their quarters Masked men were yet in evidence
occasionally so that their habits caused neither remark nor suspicion
A good many of the punchers unable to stay longer were slipping out
of town after having made a night of it In the general exodus the two
friends hoped to escape unobserved

They dropped into a side street galloped down it for two hundred yards
and dismounted at a barbwire fence which ran parallel with the road
The foremans wireclippers severed the strands one by one and they led
their horses through the gap They crossed an alfalfafield jumped an
irrigation ditch used the clippers again and found themselves in a
large pasture It was getting lighter every moment and while they
were still in the pasture a voice hailed them from the road in an
unmistakable command to halt

They bent low over the backs of their ponies and gave them the spur The
shot they had expected rang out passing harmlessly over them Another
followed and still another

Thats right Shoot up the scenery Yu dont hurt us none the
foreman said apostrophizing the man behind the gun

The next clipped fence brought them to the open country For half an
hour they rode swiftly without halt Then McWilliams drew up

Where are we making for

How about the Wind River country

Wont do First off theyll strike right down that way after us
Whats the matter with running up Sweetwater Creek and lying out in the
bad lands around the Roubideaux

Good I have a sheepcamp up that way I can arrange to have grub sent
there for us by a man I can trust

All right The Roubideaux goes

While they were nooning at a cowspring Bannister lying on his back
with his face to the turquoise sky became aware that a vagrant impulse
had crystallized to a fixed determination He broached it at once to his
companion

One thing is a cinch Mac Neither yu nor I will be safe in this
country now until we have broken up the gang of desperadoes that is
terrorizing this country If we dont get them they will get us There
isnt any doubt about that Im not willing to lie down before these
miscreants What do yu say

Im with yu old man But put a name to it What are yu proposing

Im proposing that yu and I make it our business not to have any other
business until we clean out this nest of wolves Lets go right after
them and see if we cant wipe out the ShoshoneTeton outfit

How They own the law dont they

They dont own the United States Government When they held up a
mailtrain they did a fool thing for they bucked up against Uncle
Sam What I propose is that we get hold of one of the gang and make him
weaken Then after we have got hold of some evidence that will convict
well go out and run down my namesake Ned Bannister If people once get
the idea that his hold isnt so strong theres a hundred people that
will testify against him Well have him in a Government prison inside
of six months

Or else hell have us in a hole in the ground added the foreman
dryly

One or the other admitted Bannister Are yu in on this thing

I surely am Yure the best man Ive met up with in a month of
Sundays seh Yu aint got but one fault and that is yu dont smoke
cigareets Feed yourself about a dozen a day and yu wont have a blamed
trouble left Match seh The foreman of the Lazy D already following
his own advice rolled deftly his smoke moistened it and proceeded to
blow away his troubles

Bannister looked at his debonair insouciance and laughed Water off a
ducks back he quoted I know some folks that would be sweating fear
right now Its cetainly an aggravating situation that of being an
honest man hunted as a villain by a villain But I expaict my cousins
enjoying it

He aint enjoying it so much as he would if his plans had worked out a
little smoother Hes holding the sack right now and cussing right smaht
over it being empty I reckon

He did lock the stable door a little too late chuckled the sheepman
But even as he spoke a shadow fell over his face My God I had
forgotten Yu dont suppose he would take it out of Miss Messiter

Not unless hes tired of living returned her foreman darkly One
thing this country wont stand for is that Hes got to keep his hands
off women or he loses out He dassent lay a hand on them if they dont
want him to Thats the law of the plains isnt it

Thats the unwritten law for the bad man but I notice it doesnt seem
to satisfy yu my friend Yu and I know that my cousin Ned Bannister
doesnt acknowledge any law written or unwritten Hes a devil and he
has no fear Didnt he kidnap her before

He surely would never dare touch those young ladies ButI dont know
Bann I guess we better roll along toward the Lazy D country after
all

I think so Ned looked at his friend with smiling drollery I thought
yu smoked your troubles away Jim This one seems to worry yu

McWilliams grinned sheepishly Theres one trouble wont be smoked
away It kinder dwells Then apparently apropos of nothing he added
irrelevantly Wonder what Denvers doing right now

Probably keeping that appointment yu ran away from bantered his
friend

Ill bet he is Funny how some men have all the luck murmured the
despondent foreman



CHAPTER 16 HUNTING BIG GAME

In point of fact Denvers occupation at that moment was precisely what
they had guessed it to be He was sitting beside Nora Darling in the
grand stand explaining to her the fine points of roping Mr Bob
Austin commonly known as Texas was meanwhile trying to make himself
agreeable to Helen Messiter Truth to tell both young women listened
with divided interest to their admirers Both of them had heard the
story of the night and each of them had tucked away in her corsage a
scribbled note she wanted to get back to her room and read again That
the pursuit was still on everybody knew and those on the inside were
aware that the King masquerading under the name of Jack Holloway was
the active power behind the sheriff stimulating the chase

It was after the roping had begun and Austin had been called away to
take his turn that the outlaw chief sauntered along the aisle of the
grand stand to the box in which was seated the mistress of the Lazy D

Beautiful moning isnt it Delightfully crisp and clear he said by
way of introduction stopping at her box

She understood the subtle jeer in his manner and her fine courage rose
to meet it There was a daring light in her eye a buoyant challenge in
her voice as she answered

It is a splendid morning Im not surprised you are enjoying it

Did I say I was enjoying it He laughed as he lifted the bar came
into her box and took a seat

Of course not How careless of me I had forgotten you were in mourning
for a deceased friend

His dark eyes flashed Ill not mourn for him long He was a mighty
trifling fellow anyhow Soon as I catch and hang his murderers Ill
quit wearing black

You may wear out several suits before then she hit back

Dont yu believe it when I want a thing I dont quit till its done

She met his gaze and the impact of eyes seemed to shock her physically
The wickedness in him threatened gloated dominated She shivered in
the warm sunlight and would not have had him know it for worlds

Dear me How confident you talk Arent you sometimes disappointed

Temporarily But when I want a thing I take it in the end

She knew he was serving notice on her that he meant to win her and
again the little spinal shiver raced over her She could not look at his
sardonic evil face without fear and she could not look away without
being aware of his eyes possessing her What was the use of courage
against such a creature as this

Yes I understand you take a good deal that isnt yours she retorted
carelessly her eyes on the arena

I make it mine when I take it he answered coolly admiring the
gameness which she wore as a suit of chain armor against his thrusts

Isnt it a little dangerous sometimes her even voice countered When
you take what belongs to others you run a risk dont you

Thats part of the rules Except for that I shouldnt like it so well
I hunt big game and the bigger the game the more risk Thats why yu
guessed right when yu said I was enjoying the moning

Meaningyour cousin

Well no I wasnt thinking of him though hes some sizable But Im
hunting bigger game than he is and I expect to bag it

She let her scornful eyes drift slowly over him I might pretend to
misunderstand you But I wont You may have your answer now I am not
afraid of you for since you are a bully you must be a coward I saw a
rattlesnake last week in the hills It reminded me of some one I have
seen Ill leave you to guess who

Her answer drew blood The black tide raced under the swarthy tan of his
face He leaned forward till his beady eyes were close to her defiant
ones Yu have forgotten one thing Miss Messiter A rattlesnake can
sting I ask nothing of you Cant I break your heart without your
loving me Youre only a womanand not the first I have broken by
God

His slim lithe body was leaning forward so that it cut off others and
left them to all intents alone At a touch of her fingers the handbag in
her lap flew open and a little ivoryhilted revolver lay in her hand

You may break me but youll never bend me an inch

He looked at the little gun and laughed ironically Sho If yu should
hit me with that and I should find it out I might get mad at yu

Did I say it was for you she said coldly and again the shock of
joined eyes ended in drawn battle

Have yu the nerve He looked her over so dainty and so resolute so
silken strong and he knew he had his answer

His smoldering eyes burned with desire to snatch her to him and ride
away into the hills For he was a man who lived in his sensations He
had won many women to their hurt but it was the joy of conflict that
made the pursuit worth while to him and this young woman who could so
delightfully bubble with little laughs ready to spill over and was yet
possessed of a spirit so finely superior to the tenderness of her soft
round maidenly curves allured him mightily to the attack

She dropped the revolver back into the bag and shut the clasp with a
click And now I think Mr Bannister that Ill not detain you any
longer We understand each other sufficiently

He rose with a laugh that mocked I expaict to spend quite a bit of
time understanding yu one of these days In the meantime this is to our
better acquaintance

Deliberately without the least haste he stooped and kissed her before
she could rally from the staggering surprise of the intention she read
in his eyes too late to elude Then with the coolest bravado in the
world he turned on his heel and strolled away

Angry sapphires gleamed at him from under the long brown lashes She
was furious aghast daunted By the merest chance she was sitting in a
corner of the box so screened from observation that none could see But
the insolence of him the reckless defiance of all standards of society
shook her even while it enraged her He had put forth his claim like
a braggart but he had made good with an audacity superb in its
effrontery How she hated him How she feared him The thoughts were
woven inseparably in her mind Mephisto himself could not have impressed
himself more imperatively than this strutting heartless master artist
in vice

She saw him again presently down in the arena for it was his turn to
show his skill at roping Texas had done well very well indeed He had
made the throw and tie in thirtyseven seconds which was two seconds
faster than the record of the previous year But she knew instinctively
as her fascinated eyes watched the outlaw preparing for the feat that
he was going to win He would use his success as a weapon against
her as a means of showing her that he always succeeded in whatever he
undertook So she interpreted he look he flung her as he waited at the
chute for the wild hill steer to be driven into the arena It takes a
good man physically to make a successful roper He must be possessed
of nerve skill and endurance far out of the ordinary He must be
quickeyed stronghanded nimble of foot expert of hand and built like
a wildcat So Denver explained to the two young women in the box and
the one behind him admitted reluctantly that she long lean supple
Centaur waiting impassively at the gateway fitted the specifications

Out flashed the roughcoated hill steer wild and fleet as a hare
thin and leggy with muscles of whipcord Down went the flag and the
stopwatches began to tick off the seconds Like an arrow the outlaws
pony shot forward a lariat circling round and round the riders head
At every leap the cow pony lessened the gap as it pounded forward on the
heels of the flying steer

The loop swept forward and dropped over the horns of the animal The
pony with the perfect craft of long practice swerved to one side with
a rush The dragging rope swung up against the running steers legs
grew suddenly taut Down went the steers head and next moment its feet
were swept from under it as it went heavily to the ground Man and horse
were perfect in their team work As the supple rider slid from the back
of the pony it ran to the end of the rope and braced itself to keep the
animal from rising Bannister leaped on the steer tierope in hand
Swiftly his deft hands passed to and fro making the necessary loops and
knots Then his hands went into the air The steer was hogtied

For a few seconds the judges consulted together Twentynine seconds
announced their spokesman and at the words a great cheer went up
Bannister had made his tie in record time

Impudently the scoundrel sauntered up to the grand stand bowed
elaborately to Miss Messiter and perched himself on the fence where he
might be the observed of all observers It was curious she thought
how his vanity walked hand in hand with so much power and force He was
really extraordinarily strong but no debutantes selfsufficiency could
have excelled his He was so frankly an egotist that it ceased to be a
weakness

Back in her room at the hotel an hour later Helen paced up and down
under a nervous strain foreign to her temperament She was afraid for
the first time in her life definitely afraid This man pitted against
her had deliberately divorced his life from morality In him lay no
appeal to any conscience court of last resort But the terror of this
was not for herself principally but for her flying lover With his
indubitable power backed by the unpopularity of the sheepman in this
cattle country the King of the Bighorn could destroy his cousin if
he set himself to do so Of this she was convinced and her conviction
carried a certainty that he had the will as well as the means If he
had lacked anything in motive she herself had supplied one For she was
afraid that this villain had read her heart

And as her hand went fluttering to her heart she found small comfort
in the paper lying next it that only a few hours before had brought her
joy For at any moment a messenger might come in to tell her that the
writer of it had been captured and was to be dealt with summarily in
frontier fashion At best her lover and her friend were but fugitives
from justice Against them were arrayed not only the ruffian followers
of their enemy but also the lawfully constituted authorities of the
county Even if they should escape today the net would tighten on them
and they would eventually be captured

For the third time since coming to Wyoming Helen found refuge in tears



CHAPTER 17 RUN TO EARTH

When word came to Denver and the other punchers of the Lazy D that Reddy
had been pressed into service as a guide for the posse that was pursuing
the fugitives they gave vent to their feelings in choice profanity

Now aint that like him Had to run around like a locoed calf telling
all he knowed and more till Burns ropes him in commented the disgusted
Missou

Trouble with Reddy is he sets his mouth to working and then goes away
and leaves it mourned Jim Henson

Id hate to feel as sore as Reddy will when the boys get through
playing with him after he gets back to the ranch Denver contributed
when he had exhausted his vocabulary

Meanwhile Reddy unaware of being a cause of offense was cheerfully
happy in the unexpected honor that had been thrust upon him His will
was of putty molded into the opinion of whomever he happened at the
moment to be with Just now with the ironic eye of Sheriff Burns upon
him he was strong for law enforcement

A feller hadnt ought to be so promiscuous with his hardware This
here thing of shooting up citizens dont do Wyoming no good these days
Capital aint agoing to come in when such goingson occur he sagely
opined unconsciously parroting the sentiment Burns had just been
instilling into him

Thats right sir If that aint horse sense I dont know any You got
a head on you all right answered the admiring sheriff

The flattered Reddy pleaded guilty to being wiser than most men Jest
because I punch cows aint any reason why Im anybodys fool Ill show
them smart boys at the Lazy D I dont have to take the dust of any of
the bunch when it comes to using my think tank

I would sympathized Burns You bet theyll all be almighty jealous
when they learn how you was chosen out of the whole outfit on this job

All day they rode and that night camped a few miles from the Lazy D
Early next morning they hailed a solitary rider as he passed The man
turned out to be a cowman with a small ranch not far from the one owned
by Miss Messiter

Hello Henderson yu seen anything of Jim McWilliams and another
fellow riding acrost this way asked Reddy

Nope answered the cowman promptly But immediately he modified his
statement to add that he had seen two men riding toward Dry Creek a
couple of hours ago They was going kinder slow Looked to me sorter
like one of them was hurt and the other was helping him out he
volunteered

The sheriff looked significantly at one of his men and nodded

You didnt recognize the horses I reckon

Come to think of it one of the ponies did look like Jims roan Whats
up boys Anything doing

Nothing particular We want to see Jim thats all So long

What Henderson had guessed was the truth The continuous hard riding had
been too much for Bannister and his wound had opened anew They were at
the time only a few miles from a shack on Dry Creek where the Lazy D
punchers sometimes put up McWilliams had attended the wound as best
he could and after a few hours rest had headed for the cabin in the
hills They were compelled to travel very slowly since the motion kept
the sheepmans wound continually bleeding But about noon they reached
the refuge they had been seeking and Bannister lay down on the bunk
with their saddle blankets under him He soon fell asleep and Mac took
advantage of this to set out on a foraging expedition to a ranch not
far distant Here he got some bread bacon milk and eggs from a man he
could trust and returned to his friend

It was dark by the time he reached the cabin He dismounted and with
his arms full of provisions pushed into the hut

Awake Bann he asked in a low voice

The answer was unexpected Something heavy struck his chest and flung
him back against the wall Before he could recover his balance he was
pinioned fast Four men had hurled themselves upon him

Weve got you Jim Not a mite o use resisting counseled the
sheriff

Think I dont savez that I can take a hint when a whole Methodist
church falls on me Who are yu anyhow

Somebody light a lantern ordered Burns

By the dim light it cast Mac made them out and saw Ned Bannister gagged
and handcuffed on the bed He knew a moment of surprise when his eyes
fell on Reddy

So it was yu brought them here Red he said quietly

Contrary to his own expectations the gentleman named was embarrassed
The sheriff he summoned me to serve was his lame defense

And so yu threw down your friends Good boy

A mans got to back the law up aint he

Mac turned his shoulder on him rather pointedly There isnt any need
of keeping that gag in my friends mouth any longer he suggested to
Burns

Thats right too Take it out boys I got to do my duty but I dont
aim to make any gentleman more uncomfortable than I can help I want
everything to be pleasant all round

Im right glad to hear that Burns because my friend isnt fit to
travel Yu can take me back and leave him out here with a guard the
foreman replied quickly

Sorry I cant accommodate you Jim but I got to take yu both with
me

Those are the orders of the King are they

Burns flushed darkly It aint going to do you any good to talk that
way You know mighty well this here man with you is Bannister I aint
going to take no chances on losing him now Ive got my hand on him

Yu cetainly deserve a reelection and Ill bet yu get it all right
Any man so given over to duty so plumb loaded down to the hocks with
conscience as yu will surely come back with a big majority next
November

I aint askin for YOUR vote Mac

Oh yu dont need votes Just get the King to O K your nomination
and yull win in a walk

My friend yu better mind your own business Far as I can make out yu
got troubles enough of your own retorted the nettled sheriff

Yu dont need to tell me that Tom Burns Yu aint a mannothing but
a stuffed skin worked by a string When that miscreant Bannister pulls
the string yu jump Hes jerked it now so yure taking us back to
him I can prove that coyote Morgan shot at me first but that doesnt
cut any ice with you

What made you light out so sudden then demanded the aggrieved Burns
triumphantly

Because I knew you Thats a plenty good reason Im not asking
anything for myself All I say is that my friend isnt fit to travel
yet Let him stay here under a guard till he is

He was fit enough to get here By thunder hes fit to go back

Yuve said enough Mac broke in Bannister Its awfully good of yu
to speak for me but I would rather see it out with you to a finish I
dont want any favors from this yellow dog of my cousin

The yellow dog set his teeth and swore vindictively behind them He
was already imagining an hour when these insolent prisoners of his would
sing another tune



CHAPTER 18 PLAYING FOR TIME

Theyve got em Caught them on Dry Creek just below Green Forks

Helen Messiter just finishing her breakfast at the hotel preparatory to
leaving in her machine for the ranch laid down her knife and fork and
looked with dilated eyes at Denver who had broken in with the news

Are you sure The color had washed from her face and left her very
white but she fronted the situation quietly without hysterics or fuss
of any kind

Yes maam Theyre bringing them in now to jail Watch out and yull
see them pass here in a few minutes Seems that Bannisters wound opened
up on him and he couldnt go any farther Course Mac wouldnt leave
him Sheriff Burns and his posse dropped in on them and had them covered
before Mac could chirp

You are sure this manthis desperado Bannisterwill do nothing till
night

Not the way I figure it Hell have the jail watched all day But hes
got to work the town up to a lynching I expect the bars will be free
for all today By night the worst part of this town will be ready for
anything The rest of the citizens are going to sit down and do nothing
just because it is Bannister

But it isnt Bannisternot the Bannister they think it is

He shook his head No use maam Ive talked till my throat aches but
it dont do a mite of good Nobody believes a word of what I say Yu
see we aint got any proof

Proof We have enough God knows didnt this villainthis outlaw that
calls himself Jack Hollowayattack and try to murder him

Thats what we believe but the report out is that one of us punchers
shot him up for crossing the deadline

Didnt this fellow hold up the ranch and try to take Ned Bannister away
with him

Yes maam But that doesnt look good to most people They say he had
his friends come to take him away so yu wouldnt hold him and let us
boys get him This cousin business is a fairy tale the way they size it
up How come this cousin to let him go if he held up the ranch to put
the sick man out of business No miss This country has made up its
mind that your friend is the original Ned Bannister My opinion is that
nothing on earth can save him

I dont want your opinion Im going to save him I tell you and you
are going to help Are his friends nothing but a bunch of quitters she
cried with sparkling eyes

I didnt know I was such a great friend of his answered the cowboy
sulkily

Youre a friend of Jim McWilliams arent you Are you going to sneak
away and let these curs hang him

Denver flushed Yure dead right Miss Helen I guess Ill see it out
with you Whats the orders

I want you to help me organize a defense Get all Macs friends stirred
up to make a fight for him Bring as many of them in to see me during
the day as you can If you see any of the rest of the Lazy D boys send
them in to me for instructions Report yourself every hour to me And
make sure that at least three of your friends that you can trust are
hanging round the jail all day so as to be ready in case any attempt is
made to storm it before dark

Ill see to it Denver hung on his heel a moment before leaving Its
only square to tell yu Miss Helen that this means war here tonight
These streets are going to run with blood if we try to save them

Im taking that responsibility she told him curtly but a moment
later she added gently I have a plan my friend that may stop this
outrage yet But you must do your best for me She smiled sadly at him
Youre my foreman today you know

Im going to do my level best yu may tie to that he told her
earnestly

I know you will And their fingers touched for an instant

Through a window the girl could see a crowd pouring down the street
toward the hotel She flew up the stairs and out upon the secondstory
piazza that looked down upon the road

From her point of vantage she easily picked them outthe two unarmed
men riding with their hands tied behind their backs encircled by a
dozen riders armed to the teeth Bannisters hat had apparently fallen
off farther down the street for the man beside him was dusting it The
wounded prisoner looked about him without fear but it was plain he was
near the limit of endurance He was pale as a sheet and his fair curls
clung moistly to his damp forehead

McWilliams caught sight of her first and she could see him turn and
say a word to his comrade Bannister looked up caught sight of her and
smiled That smile so pale and wan went to her heart like a knife But
the message of her eyes was hope They told the prisoners silently to be
of good cheer that at least they were not deserted to their fate

What is it aboutthe crowd Nora asked of her mistress as the latter
was returning to the head of the stairs

In as few words as she could Helen told her repressing sharply the
tears the girl began to shed This is not the time to weepnot yet
We must save them You can do your part Mr Bannister is wounded Get
a doctor over the telephone and see that he attends him at the prison
Dont leave the phone until you have got one to promise to go
immediately

Yes miss Is there anything else

Ask the doctor to call you up from the prison and tell you how Mr
Bannister is Make it plain to him that he is to give up his other
practice if necessary and is to keep us informed through the day about
his patients condition I will be responsible for his bill

Helen herself hurried to the telegraph office at the depot She wrote
out a long dispatch and handed it to the operator Send this at once
please

He was one of those supercilious young idiots that make the most of such
small power as ever drifts down to them Taking the message he tossed
it on the table Ill send it when I get time

Youll send it now

Whatwhats that

Her steady eyes caught and held his shifting ones I say you are going
to send it nowthis very minute

I guess not The lines busy he bluffed

If you dont begin sending that message this minute Ill make it my
business to see that you lose your position she told him calmly

He snatched up the paper from the place where he had tossed it Oh
well if its so darned important heconceded ungraciously

She stood quietly above him while he sent the telegram even though he
contrived to make every moment of her stay an unvoiced insult Her
wire was to the wife of the Governor of the State They had been close
friends at school and the latter had been urging Helen to pay a visit
to Cheyenne The message she sent was as follows

Battle imminent between outlaws and cattlemen here Bloodshed certain
tonight My foreman last night killed in selfdefense a desperado
Bannisters gang in league with town authorities mean to lynch him
and one of my other friends after dark this evening Sheriff will do
nothing Can your husband send soldiers immediately Wire answer

The operator looked up sullenly after his fingers had finished the last
tap Well

Just one thing more Helen told him You understand the rules of the
company about secrecy Nobody you knows I am sending this message If by
any chance it should leak out I shall know through whom If you want to
hold your position you will keep quiet

I know my business he growled Nevertheless she had spoken in
season for he had had it in his mind to give a tip where he knew
it would be understood to hasten the jail delivery and accompanying
lynching

When she returned to the hotel Helen found Missou waiting for her
She immediately sent him back to the office and told him to wait there
until the answer was received Ill send one of the boys up to relieve
you so that you may come with the telegram as soon as it arrives I
want the operator watched all day Oh heres Jim Henson Denver has
explained the situation to you I presume I want you to go up to the
telegraph office and stay there all day Go to lunch with the operator
when he goes Dont let him talk privately to anybody not even for a
few seconds I dont want you to seem to have him under guard before
outsiders but let him know it very plainly He is not to mention a wire
I sent or the answer to itnot to anybody Jim Is that plain

Yu bet Hes a clam all right till the order is countermanded And
the young man departed with a cheerful grin that assured Helen she had
nothing to fear from official leaks

Nora from answering a telephone call came to report to the general
in charge The doctor says that he has looked after Mr Bannister and
there is no immediate danger If he keeps quiet for a few days he ought
to do well Mr McWilliams sent a message by him to say that we arent
to worry about him He said he wouldwouldrope a heap of cows on the
Lazy D yet

Nora bursting into tears flung herself into Helens arms They are
going to kill him I know they are andand twas only yesterday
maam I told him not toto get gay the poor boy When he tried
toto She broke down and sobbed

Her mistress smiled in spite of herself though she was bitterly aware
that even Noras grief was only superficially ludicrous

Were going to save him Nora if we can Theres hope while theres
life You see Mac himself is full of courage HE hasnt given up We
must keep up our courage too

Yes maam but this is the first gentleman friend I ever had hanged
and She broke off sobbing leaving the rest as a guess

Helen filled it out aloud And you were going to say that you care more
for him than any of the others Well you must stop coquetting and tell
him so when we have saved him

Yes maam agreed Nora very repentant for the moment of the fact
that it was her nature to play with the hearts of those of the
male persuasion Immediately she added He was THAT kind maam
tenderhearted

Helen whose own heart was breaking continued to soothe her Dont say
WAS child You are to be brave and not think of him that way

Yes maam He told me he was going to buy cows with the thousand
dollars he won yesterday I knew he meant

Yes of course Its a cowboys way of saying that he means to start
housekeeping Have you the telegram Missou For that young man was
standing in the doorway

He handed her the yellow slip She ripped open the envelope and read
Company B en route Railroad connections uncertain Postpone crisis long
as possible May reach Gimlet Butte by tenthirty

Her first thought was of unspeakable relief The militia was going to
take a hand The boys in khaki would come marching down the street and
everything would be all right But hard on the heels of her instinctive
gladness trod the sober second thought Tenthirty at best and perhaps
later Would they wait that long or would they do their cowardly work
as soon as night fell She must contrive to delay them till the train
drew in She must play for those two lives with all her womans wit
must match the outlaws sinister cunning and fool him into delay She
knew he would come if she sent for him But how long could she keep
him As long as he was amused at her agony as long as his pleasure in
tormenting her was greater than his impatience to be at his ruffianly
work Oh if she ever needed all her power it would be tonight

Throughout the day she continued to receive hourly reports from Denver
who always brought with him four or five honest cowpunchers from
upcountry to listen to the strange tale she unfolded to them It was
of course in part the spell of her sweet personality of that shy
appeal she made to the manhood in them but of those who came nearly
all believed for the time at least and aligned themselves on her side
in the struggle that was impending Some of these were swayed from their
allegiance in the course of the day but a few she knew would remain
true

Meanwhile all through the day the enemy was busily at work As Denver
had predicted free liquor was served to all who would drink The
town and its guests were started on a grand debauch that was to end in
violence that might shock their sober intelligence Everywhere poisoned
whispers were being flung broadcast against the two men waiting in the
jail for what the night would bring forth

Dusk fell on a town crazed by bad whiskey and evil report The deeds of
Bannister were hashed and rehashed at every bar and nobody related them
with more ironic gusto than the man who called himself Jack Holloway
There were people in town who knew his real name and character but of
these the majority were either in alliance with him or dared not voice
their knowledge Only Miss Messiter and her punchers told the truth and
their words were blown away like chaff

From the first moment of darkness Helen had the outlaw leader dogged by
two of her men Since neither of these were her own riders this was
done without suspicion At intervals of every quarter of an hour they
reported to her in turn Bannister was beginning to drink heavily and
she did not want to cut short his dissipation by a single minute Yet
she had to make sure of getting his attention before he went too far

It was close to nine when she sent him a note not daring to delay a
minute longer For the reports of her men were all to the same effect
that the crisis would not now be long postponed Bannister or Holloway
as he chose to call himself was at the bar with his lieutenants in evil
when the note reached him He read it with a satisfaction he could not
conceal So He had brought her already to her knees Before he was
through with her she should grovel in the dust before him

Ill be back in a few minutes Do nothing till I return he ordered
and went jingling away to the Elk House

The young womans anxiety was pitiable but she repressed it sternly
when she went to meet the man she feared and never had it been more in
evidence than in this hour of her greatest torture Blithely she came
forward to meet him eye challenging eye gayly No hint of her anguish
escaped into her manner He read there only coquetry the eternal sex
conflict the winsome defiance of a woman hitherto the virgin mistress
of all assaults upon her hearts citadel It was the last thing he had
expected to see but it was infinitely more piquant more intoxicating
than desperation She seemed to give the lie to his impression of her
love for his cousin and that too delighted his pride

You will sit down

Carelessly almost indolently she put the question her raised eyebrows
indicating a chair with perfunctory hospitality He had not meant to
sit had expected only to gloat a few minutes over her despair but
this situation called for more deliberation He had yet to establish the
mastery his vanity demanded Therefore he took a chair

This is cetainly an unexpected honor Did yu send for me to explain
some more about that sufficient understanding between us he sneered

It was a great relief to her to see that though he had been drinking
as she had heard he was entirely master of himself Her efforts might
still be directed to Philip sober

I sent for you to congratulate you she answered with a smile You
are a bigger man than I thought You have done what you said you would
do and I presume you can very shortly go out of mourning

He radiated vanity seemed to visibly expand Do yu go in when I go
out he asked brutally

She laughed lightly Hardly But it does seem as if Im unlucky in my
foremen They all seem to have engagements across the divide

Ill get y u another

Thank you I was going to ask as much of you Can you suggest one now

Im a right good cattle man myself

Andcan you stay with me a reasonable time

He laughed I have no engagements across the Styx maam

My other foremen thought they were permanent fixtures here too

Were all liable to mistakes

Even you I suppose

Ill sign a lease to give yu possession of my skill for as long as yu
like

She settled herself comfortably back in an easy chair as alluring a
picture of buoyant radiant youth as he had seen in many a day But the
terms I am afraid I cant offer you as much as you make at your present
occupation

I could keep that up as a sideline

So you could But if you use my time for your own profit you ought to
pay me a royalty on your intake

His eyes lit with laughter I reckon that can be arranged Any
percentage you think fair It will all be in the family anyway

I think that is one of the things about which we dont agree she made
answer softly flashing him the proper look of inviting disdain from
under her silken lashes

He leaned forward elbow on the chairarm and chin in hand Well agree
about it one of these days

Think so she returned airily

I dont think I know

Just an eyebeat her gaze met his with that hint of shy questioning of
puzzled doubt that showed a growing interest I wonder she murmured
and recovered herself little laugh

How she hated her task and him She was a singularly honest woman but
she must play the siren must allure this scoundrel to forgetfulness
with a hurried and yet elude the very familiarity her manner invited
She knew her part the heartless enticing coquette compounded half
of passion and half of selfishness It was a hateful thing to do this
sacrifice of her personal reticence of the individual abstraction in
which she wrapped herself as a cloak in order to hint at a possibility
of some intimacy of feeling between them She shrank from it with a
repugnance hardly to be overcome but she held herself with an iron will
and consummate art to the role she had undertaken Two lives hung on
her success She must not forget that She would not let herself forget
thatand one of them that of the man she loved

So bravely she played her part repelling always with a hint of
invitation denying with the promise in her fascinated eyes of ultimate
surrender to his ardor In the zest of the pursuit the minutes slipped
away unnoticed Never had a woman seemed to him more subtly elusive and
never had he felt more sure of himself Her charm grew on him stirred
his pulses to a faster beat For it was his favorite sport and this
warm supple young creature who was to be the victim of his bow and
arrow showed herself worthy of his mettle

The clock downstairs struck the halfhour and Bannister reminded of
what lay before him outside made a move to go Her alert eyes had been
expecting it and she forestalled him by a change of tactics Moved
apparently by impulse she seated herself on the pianostool swept the
keys for an instant with her fingers and plunged into the brilliant
Carmen overture Susceptible as this man was to the influence of
music he could not fail to be arrested by so perfect an interpretation
of his mood He stood rooted was carried back again in imagination to
a great artistes rendering of that story of fierce passion and aching
desire so brilliantly enacted under the white sunbeat of a country
of cloudless skies Imperceptibly she drifted into other parts of the
opera Was it the wild gypsy seductiveness of _Carmen_ that he felt
or rather this American girls allurement From Love will like a
birdling fly she slipped into the exquisitely graceful snatches of song
with which _Carmen_ answers the officers questions Their rare buoyancy
marched with his mood and from them she carried him into the song
Over the hill that is so perfect and romantic an expression of the
_wanderlust_

How long she could have held him she will never know for at that
inopportune time came blundering one of his men into the room with a
call for his presence to take charge of the situation outside

What do yu want Bostwick he demanded with curt peremptoriness

The man whispered in his ear

Cant wait any longer cant they snapped his chief Yu tell them
theyll wait till I give the word Understand

He almost flung the man out of the room but Helen noticed that she had
lost him His interest was perfunctory and though he remained a little
time longer it was to establish his authority with the men rather than
to listen to her Twice he looked at his watch within five minutes

He rose to go There is a little piece of business I have to put
through So Ill have to ask yu to excuse me I have had a delightful
hour and I hate to go He smiled and quoted with mock sentimentality

The hours I spent with thee dear heart Are as a string of pearls to
me I count them over every one apart My rosary My rosary

Dear me One certainly lives and learns How could I have guessed that
with your reputation you could afford to indulge in a rosary she
mocked

Good night He offered his hand

Dont go yet she coaxed

He shook his head Duty yu know

Stay only a little longer Just ten minutes more

His vanity purred so softly she stroked it Cant Wish I could Yu
hear how noisy things are getting Ive got to take charge Solong

She stood close looking up at him with a face of seductive appeal

Dont go yet Please

The triumph of victory mounted to his head Ill come back when Ive
done what Ive got to do

No no Stay a little longer just a little

Not a minute sweetheart

He bent to kiss her and a little clenched fist struck his face

Dont you dare she cried

The outraged woman in her curbed all evening with an iron bit escaped
from control Delightedly he laughed The hot spirit in her pleased him
mightily He took her little hands and held them in one of his while he
smiled down at her I guess that kiss will keep my girl till I come
back

My God Are you going to kill your own cousin

All her terror all her detestation and hatred of him looked haggardly
out of her unmasked face His narrowed eyes searched her heart and his
countenance grew every second more sinister

Yu have been fooling me all evening then

Yes and hating you every minute of the time

Yu dared His face was black with rage

You would like to kill me Why dont you

Because I know a better revenge Im going out to take it now After
your lover is dead Ill come back and make love to yu again he
sneered

Never She stood before him like a queen in her lissom brave defiant
youth And as for your cousin you may kill him but you cant destroy
his contempt for you He will die despising you for a coward and a
scoundrel

It was true and he knew it In his heart he cursed her while he vainly
sought some weapon that would strike home through her impervious armor

Yu love him Ill remember that when I see him kick he taunted

I make you a present of the information I love him and I despise you
Nothing can change those facts she retorted whitely

Mebbe but some day yull crawl on your knees to beg my pardon for
having told me so

There is your overweening vanity again she commented

Im going to break yu my beauty so that yull come running when I
snap my fingers

Well see

And in the meantime Ill go hang your lover He bowed ironically
swung on his jingling heel and strode out of the room

She stood there listening to his dying footfalls then covered her
face with her hands as if to press back the dreadful vision her mind
conjured



CHAPTER 19 WEST POINT TO THE RESCUE

It was understood that the sheriff should make a perfunctory defense
against the mob in order to square him with the voters at the election
soon to be held But the word had been quietly passed that the bullets
of the prison guards would be fired over the heads of the attackers
This assurance lent an added braggadocio to the Dutch courage of the
lynchers Many of them who would otherwise have hung back distinguished
themselves by the enthusiasm which they displayed

Bannister himself generaled the affair detailing squads to batter down
the outer door to guard every side of the prison and to overpower the
sheriffs guard That official according to programme appeared at a
window and made a little speech declaring his intention of performing
his duty at whatever cost He was hooted down with jeers and laughter
and immediately the attack commenced

The yells of the attackers mingled with the sound of the axeblows and
the report of revolvers from inside the building Among those nearest
to the door being battered down were Denver and the few men he had with
him His plan offered merely a forlorn hope It was that in the first
scramble to get in after the way was opened he and his friends might
push up the stairs in the van and hold the corridor for as long as they
could against the furious mob

It took less than a quarter of an hour to batter down the door and
among the first of those who sprang across the threshold were Denver
Missou Frisco and their allies While others stopped to overpower
the struggling deputies according to the arranged farce they hurried
upstairs and discovered the cell in which their friends were fastened

Frisco passed a revolver through the grating to McWilliams and another
to Bannister Havent got the keys so I cant let yu out old hoss
he told the foreman But mebbe yu wont feel so lonesome with these
little toys to play with

Meanwhile Denver a young giant of seventysix inches held the head of
the stairs with four stalwart plainsmen back of him The rush of many
feet came up pellmell and he flung the leaders back on those behind

Hold on there This isnt a freelunch counter Dont you see were
crowded up here already

Whats eating you Whyfor cant we come growled one of the foremost
nursing an injured nose

Ive just explained to you son that its crowded Folks are prevalent
enough up here right now Send up that bunch of keys and well bring
your meat to you fast enough

Whats that Whats that The outlaw chief pushed his way through the
dense mob at the door and reached the stairway

He wont let us up growled one of them

Who wont demanded Bannister sharply and at once came leaping up the
stairs

Nothing doing drawled Frisco and tossed him over the railing on to
the heads of his followers below

They carried Bannister into the open air for his head had struck the
newelpost in his descent This gave the defense a few minutes respite

Theyre going to come ashooting next time remarked Denver Just as
soon as he comes back from byelow land youll see things hum

Yu bet agreed Missou Well last about three minutes when the
stampede begins

The scream of an engine pierced the night

Denvers face lit Make it five minutes Missou and Mac is safe At
least Im hoping so awful hard Miss Helen wired for the militia from
Sheridan this nothing Chances are theyre on that train I couldnt
tell you earlier because she made me promise not to She was afraid it
might leak out and get things started sooner

Weak but furious the miscreant from the Shoshones returned to the
attack Break in the back door and sneak up behind on those fellows
Well have the men we want inside of fifteen minutes he promised the
mob

Well rush them from both sides and show those guys on the landing
whether they can stop us added Bostwick

Suddenly some one raised the cry The soldiers Bannister looked up
the street and swore a vicious oath Swinging down the road at double
time came a company of militia in khaki He was mad with baffled fury
but he made good his retreat at once and disappeared promptly into the
nearest dark alley

The mob scattered by universal impulse disintegrated so promptly that
within five minutes the soldiers held the ground alone save for the
officials of the prison and Denvers little band

A boyish lieutenant lately out of the Point and just come in to
a lieutenancy in the militia was in command In time he asked
anxiously for this was his first independent expedition

Yu bet chuckled Denver Were right glad to see you and Ill
bet those boys in the cage aint regretting your arrival any Fifteen
minutes later and you would have been in time to hold the funeral
services I reckon

Where is Miss Messiter asked the young officer

Shes at the Elk House colonel I expect some of us better drift over
there and tell her its all right Shes the gamest little woman that
ever crossed the Wyoming line Hadnt been for her these boys would have
been across the divide hours ago Shes a plumb thoroughbred Wouldnt
give up an inch All day she has generaled this thing played a mighty
weak hand for a heap more than it was worth Sand Seh shes grit clear
through if anybody asks you And Denver told the story of the
day making much of her unflinching courage and nothing of her mens
readiness to back whatever steps she decided upon

It was ten minutes past eleven when a smooth young applecheeked lad in
khaki presented himself before Helen Messiter with a bow never invented
outside of West Point

I am Lieutenant Beecher Governor Raleigh presents his compliments by
me Miss Messiter and is very glad to be able to put at your service
such forces as are needed to quiet the town

You were in time she breathed

With about five minutes to spare I am having the prisoners brought
here for the night if you do not object In the morning I shall
investigate the affair and take such steps as are necessary In
the meantime you may rest assured that there will be no further
disturbance

Thank you I am sure that with you in command everything will now be all
right and I am quite of your opinion that the prisoners had better stay
here for the night One of them is wounded and ought to be given the
best attention But of course you will see to that lieutenant

The young man blushed This was the right kind of appreciation He
wished his old classmates at the Point could hear how implicitly this
sweet girl relied on him

Certainly And now Miss Messiter if there is nothing you wish I
shall retire for the night You may sleep with perfect confidence

I am sure I may lieutenant She gave him a broadside of trusting eyes
full of admiration But perhaps you would like me to see my foreman
first just to relieve my mind And as you were about to say his
friend might be brought in too since they are together

The young man promptly assented though he had not been aware that he
was about to say anything of the kind

They came in together Bannister supported by McWilliamss arm The eyes
of both mistress and maid brimmed over with tears when they saw them
Helen dragged forward a chair for the sheepman and he sank into it
From its depths he looked up with his rare sweet smile

Ive heard about it he told her in a low voice Ive heard how
yu fought for my life all day Theres nothing I can say I owed yu
everything already twice and now I owe it all over again Give me a
lifetime and I couldnt get even

Helens swift glance swept over Nora and the foreman They were in a
dark alcove oblivious of anybody else Also they were in each others
arms frankly For some reason wine flowed into the cream of Helens
cheeks

Do you have to get even Among friends is that necessary she asked
shyly

I hope not If it is Im sure bankrupt Even my thanks seem to stay at
home If yu hadnt done so much for me perhaps I could tell yu how
much yu had done But I have no words to say it

Then dont she advised

Yure the best friend a man ever had Thats all I can say

Its enough since you mean it even though it isnt true she
answered gently

Their eyes met fastened for an instant and by common consent looked
away

As it chanced they were close to the window their shadows reflected on
the blind A man slipping past in the street on horseback stopped
at sight of that lighted window with the moving shadows in an
uncontrollable white fury He slid from the saddle threw the reins
over the horses head to the ground and slipped his revolver from its
holster and back to make sure that he could draw it easily Then he
passed springily across the road to the hotel and up the stairs He trod
lightly stealthily and by his very wariness defeated his purpose
of eluding observation For a pair of keen eyes from the hotel office
glimpsed the figure stealing past so noiselessly and promptly followed
up the stairway

Hope I dont intrude at this happy family gathering

Helen who had been pouring a glass of cordial for the spent and wounded
sheepman put the glass down on the table and turned at sound of the
silken sinister voice After one glance at the vindictive face from
the cold eyes of which hate seemed to smolder she took an instinctive
step toward her lover The cold wave that drenched her heart accompanied
an assurance that the man in the doorway meant trouble

His sleek smile arrested her He was standing with his feet apart his
hands clasped lightly behind his back as natty and as well groomed as
was his wont

Ah make the most of what ye yet may spend Before ye too into the
Dust descend Dust into Dust and under Dust to lie Sans Wine sans
Song sans Singer andsans End

he misquoted with a sneer and immediately interrupted his irony to
give way to one of his sudden blind rages

With incredible swiftness his right hand moved forward and up catching
revolver from scabbard as it rose But by a fraction of a second his
purpose had been anticipated A closed fist shot forward to the salient
jaw in time to fling the bullets into the ceiling An arm encircled the
outlaws neck and flung him backward down the stairs The railing broke
his fall and on it his body slid downward the weapon falling from his
hand He pulled himself together at the foot of the stairs crouched for
an upward rush but changed his mind instantly The young officer who
had flung him down had him covered with his own sixshooter He could
hear footsteps running toward him and he knew that in a few seconds he
would be in the hands of the soldiers Plunging out of the doorway the
desperado vaulted to the saddle and drove his spurs home For a minute
hoofs pounded on the hard white road Then the night swallowed him and
the echo of his disappearance

That was Bannister of the Shoshones and the Tetons the girls white
lips pronounced to Lieutenant Beecher

And I let him get away from me the disappointed lad groaned Why I
had him right in my hands I could have throttled him as easy But how
was I to know he would have nerve enough to come rushing into a hotel
full of soldiers hunting him

Yu have a very persistent cousin Mr Bannister said McWilliams
coming forward from the alcove with shining eyes And I must say hes
game Did yu ever hear the like Come butting in here as cool as if he
hadnt a thing to do but sing out orders like he was in his own home He
was that easy

It seems to me that a little of the praise is due Lieutenant Beecher
If he hadnt dealt so competently with the situation murder would have
been done Did you learn your boxing at the Academy Lieutenant Helen
asked trying to treat the situation lightly in spite of her hammering
heart

I was the champion middleweight of our class Beecher could not help
saying boyishly with another of his blushes

I can easily believe it returned Helen

I wish yu would teach me how to double up a man so prompt and
immediate said the admiring foreman

I expect Im under particular obligations to that straight right to
the chin Lieutenant chimed in the sheepman The fact is that I dont
seem to be able to get out anything except thanks these days I ought
to send my cousin a letter thanking him for giving me a chance to owe so
much kindness to so many people

Your cousin repeated the uncomprehending officer

This desperado Bannister is my cousin answered the sheepman
gravely

But if he was your cousin why should he wantto kill you

Thats a long story Lieutenant Will yu hear it now

If you feel strong enough to tell it

Oh Im strong enough He glanced at Helen Perhaps we had better not
tire Miss Messiter with it If yull come to my room

I should like above all things to hear it again interrupted that
young woman promptly

For the man she loved had just come back to her from the brink of the
grave and she was still reluctant to let him out of her sight

So Ned Bannister told his story once more and out of the alcove came
the happy foreman and Nora to listen to the tale While he told it his
sweethearts contented eyes were on him The excitement of the night
burnt pleasantly in her veins for out of the nettle danger she had
plucked safety for her sheepman



CHAPTER 20 TWO CASES OF DISCIPLINE

The Fourth of July celebration at Gimlet Butte had been a thing of the
past for four days and the Lazy D had fallen back into the routine of
ranch life The riders were discussing supper and the continued absence
of Reddy when that young man drew back the flap and joined them

He stood near the doorway and grinned with embarrassed guilt at the
assembled company

I reckon I got too much Fourth of July at Gimlet Butte boys Thats
how come I to be onpunctual getting back

There was a long silence during which those at the table looked at him
with an expressionless gravity that did not seem to veil an unduly warm
welcome

Hello Mac Hello boys I just got back he further contributed

Without comment the Lazy D resumed supper Apparently it had not
missed Reddy or noticed his return Casual conversation was picked up
cheerfully The return of the prodigal was quite ignored

Then that blamed cow gits its back up and makes a beeline for Rogers
The old man hikes for his pony and

Seems good to git my legs under the old table again interrupted Reddy
with cheerful unease

loses by about half a second continued Missou If Doc hadnt roped
its hind laig

Have some cigars boys I brought a box back with me Reddy tossed a
handful on the table where they continued to lie unnoticed

theres no telling what would have happened As twas the old man got
off with a

Yu bet theyre good cigars all right broke in the propitiatory
Reddy

The interrupted anecdote went on to a finish and the men trooped out and
left the prodigal alone with his hash When that young man reached the
bunkhouse Frisco was indulging in a reminiscence Reddy got only the
last of it but that did not contribute to his serenity

Yep When I was working on the Silver Dollar Must abeen three years
ago I reckon when Jerry Miller got that chapping

Threw down the outfit in a row they had with the Lafferty crowd didnt
he asked Denver

Frisco nodded

Mac got up glanced round and reached for his hat I reckon Ill have
to be going he said and forthright departed

Reddy reached for HIS hat and rose I got to go and have a talk with
Mac he explained

Denver got to the door first and his big frame filled it

Dont hurry Reddy It aint polite to rush away right after dinner
Besides Mac will be here all day He aint starting for New York

Yure gittin blamed particular Mac he went right out

But Mac didnt have a most particular engagement with the boys Theres
a difference

Why I aint got Reddy paused and looked around helplessly

Gents I move yu that it be the horse sense of the Lazy D that our
friend Mr Reddy Reeves be given gratis one chapping immediately if not
sooner The reason for which same being that he played a lowdown trick
on the outfit whose bread he was eating

Oh quit your foolin boys besought the victim anxiously

And that Denver being some ablebodied and having a good reach be
requested to deliver same to the gent needing it concluded Missou

Reddy backed in alarm to the wall Yu boys dont want to get gay with
me Yu cant monkey with

Motion carried unanimously

Just as Reddy whipped out his revolver Denvers long leg shot out
and his foot caught the wrist behind the weapon When Reddy next took
cognizance of his surroundings he was serving as a mattress for the
anatomy of three stalwart riders He was gently deposited face down on
his bunk with a onehundredeightypound live peg at the end of each arm
and leg

All ready Denver announced Frisco from the end of the left foot

Denver selected a pair of plain leather chaps with care and proceeded to
business What he had to do he did with energy It is safe to say
that at least one of those present can still vividly remember this and
testify to his thoroughness

Mac drifted in after the disciplining As foreman it was fitting that
he should be discreetly ignorant of what had occurred but he could not
help saying

That yu I heard singing Reddy Seems to me yu had ought to take
that voice into grand opera The way yu straddle them high notes is
a caution for fair What was it yu was singing Sounded like Would I
were far from here love

Yu go to hell choked Reddy rushing past him from the bunkhouse

McWilliams looked round innocently I judge some of yu boys must
abeen teasing Reddy from his manner Seemed like he didnt want to sit
down and talk

I shouldnt wonder but hell hold his conversations standing for a day
or two returned Missou gravely

At the end of the laugh that greeted this Mac replied

Well yu boys want to be gentle with him Hes so plumb tender now
that I reckon hell get along without any more treatment in that line
from us drawled Frisco

Mac departed laughing He had an engagement that recurred daily in the
dusk of the evening and he was always careful to be on time The other
party to the engagement met him at the kitchen door and fell with him
into the trail that led to Lee Mings laundry

What made you late she asked

Im not late honey I seem late because youre so anxious he
explained

Im not protested Nora indignantly If you think youre the only man
on the place Jim McWilliams

Sho Hold your hawsses a minute Nora darling A spinster like yu

You think youre awful funnywriting in my autograph album that a
spinsters best friend is her powder box I like Mr Hallidays ways
better Hes a perfect gentleman

I aint got a word to say against Denver even if he did write in your
book

 Sugar is sweet
 The sky is blue
 Grass is green
 And so are you

I reckon being a perfect gentleman he meant

You know very well you wrote that in yourself and pretended it was Mr
Halliday signing his name and everything It wasnt a bit nice of you

Now do I look like a forger he wanted to know with innocence on his
cherubic face

Anyway you know it was mean Mr Halliday wouldnt do such a thing You
take your arm down and keep it where it belongs Mr McWilliams

That aint my name Nora darling and Id like to know where my arm
belongs if it isnt round the prettiest girl in Wyoming Whats the use
of being engaged if

Im not sure Im going to stay engaged to you announced the young
woman coolly walking at the opposite edge of the path from him

Now that aint any way to talk

You neednt lecture me Im not your wife and I dont think Im going
to be cut in Nora whose temper was ruffled on account of having had
to wait for him as well as for other reasons

Yu surely wouldnt make me sue yu for breach of promise would yu
he demanded with a burlesque of anxiety that was the final straw

Nora turned on her heel and headed for the house

Now dont yu get mad at me honey I was only joking he explained as
he pursued her

You think you can laugh at me all you please Ill show you that you
cant she informed him icily

Sho I wasnt laughing at yu What tickled me

Im not interested in your amusement Mr McWilliams

Whats the use of flying out about a little thing like that Honest
I dont even know what youre mad at me for the perplexed foreman
averred

Im not mad at you as you call it Im simply disgusted

And with a final Good night flung haughtily over her shoulder Miss
Nora Darling disappeared into the house

Mac took off his hat and gazed at the door that had been closed in his
face He scratched his puzzled poll in vain

I cetainly got mine good and straight just like Reddy got his But
what in time was it all about And me thinkin I was a graduate in the
study of the ladies I reckon I never did get jarred up so Its plumb
discouraging

If he could have caught a glimpse of Nora at that moment lying on her
bed and crying as if her heart would break Mac might have found the
situation less hopeless



CHAPTER 21 THE SIGNAL LIGHTS

In a little hillrift about a mile back of the Lazy D Ranch was a
deserted miners cabin

The hut sat on the edge of a bluff that commanded a view of the
buildings below while at the same time the pines that surrounded it
screened the shack from any casual observation A thin curl of smoke was
rising from the mud chimney and inside the cabin two men lounged before
the open fire

Its his move and he is going to make it soon Every night I look
for him to drop down on the ranch His hates kind of volcanic Mr Ned
Bannisters is and its bound to bubble over mighty sudden one of these
days said the younger of the two rising and stretching himself

It did bubble over some when he drove two thousand of my sheep over the
bluff and killed the whole outfit suggested the namesake of the man
mentioned

Yes I reckon thats some irritating agreed McWilliams But if I
know him he isnt going to be content with sheep so long as he can take
it out of a real live man

Or woman suggested the sheepman

Or woman agreed the other Especially when he thinks he can cut yu
deeper by striking at her If he doesnt raid the Lazy D one of these
nights Im a blamed poor prophet

Bannister nodded agreement Hes near the end of his rope He could
see that if he were blind When we captured Bostwick and they got a
confession out of him that started the landslide against him It began
to be noised abroad that the government was going to wipe him out Folks
began to lose their terror of him and after that his whole outfit began
to want to turn States evidence He isnt sure of one of them now
cant tell when he will be shot in the back by one of his own scoundrels
for that two thousand dollars reward

The foreman strolled negligently to the door His eyes drifted
indolently down into the valley and immediately sparkled with
excitement

The signals out Bann he exclaimed Its in your window

The sheepman leaped to his feet and strode to the door Down in the
valley a light was gleaming in a window Even while he looked another
light appeared in a second window

She wants us both cried the foreman running to the little corral
back of the house

He presently reappeared with two horses both saddled and they took the
downward trail at once

If Miss Helen can keep him in play till we arrive murmured Mac
anxiously

She can if he gives her a chance and I think he will Theres a kind
of cat instinct in him to play with his prey

Yes but he missed his kill last time by letting her fool him Thats
what Im afraid of that he wont wait

They had reached lower ground now and could put their ponies at a
pounding gallop that ate up the trail fast As they approached the
houses both men drew rein and looked carefully to their weapons Then
they slid from the saddles and slipped noiselessly forward

What the foreman had said was exactly true Helen Messiter did want them
both and she wanted them very much indeed

After supper she had been dreamily playing over to herself one of
Chopins waltzes when she became aware by some instinct that she was
not alone in the room There had been no least sound no slightest stir
to betray an alien presence Yet that some one was in the room she knew
and by some subtle sixth sense could even put a name to the intruder

Without turning she called over her shoulder Shall I finish the
waltz No faintest tremor in the clear sweet voice betrayed the racing
heart

Yure a cool hand my friend came his ready answer But I think
well dispense with the music I had enough last time to serve me for
twice

She laughed as she swung on the stool with that musical scorn which
both allured and maddened I did rather do you that time she allowed

This is the return match You won then I win now he told her with a
look that chilled

Indeed But isnt that rather discounting the future

Only the immediate future Yure mine my beauty and I mean to take
yu with me

Just a disdainful sweep of her eyes she gave him as she rose from the
pianostool and rearranged the lamps You mean so much that never comes
to pass Mr Bannister The road to the nether regions is paved with
good intentions we are given to understand Not that yours can by any
stretch of imagination be called good intentions

Contrariwise then perhaps the road to heaven may be paved with evil
intentions Since yu travel the road with me wherever it may lead it
were but gallant to hope so

He took three sharp steps toward her and stood looking down in her face
her sweet slenderness so close to him that the perfume mounted to his
brain Surely no maiden had ever been more desirable than this one who
held him in such contemptuous estimation that only her steady eyes
moved at his approach These held to his and defied him while she stood
leaning motionless against the table with such strong and supple grace
She knew what he meant to do hated him for it and would not give him
the satisfaction of flying an inch from him or struggling with him

Your eyes are pools of splendor Thats right Make them flash fire
I love to see such spirit since it offers a more enticing pleasure
in breaking he told her with an admiration half ironic but wholly
genuine Pools of splendor my beauty Therefore I salute them

At the touch of his lips upon her eyelids a shiver ran through her but
still she made no movement was cold to him as marble You coward she
said softly with an infinite contempt

Your lips he continued to catalogue are ripe as fresh flesh of
Southern fruit No cupid ever possessed so adorable a mouth A worshiper
of Eros I as now I prove

This time it was the mouth he kissed the while her unconquered spirit
looked out of the brave eyes and fain would have murdered him In turn
he kissed her cold cheeks the tip of one of her little ears the small
clenched fist with which she longed to strike him

Are you quite through

For the present and now having put the seal of my ownership on her
more obvious charms Ill take my bride home

I would die first

Nay youll die later Madam Bannister but not for many years I
hope he told her with a theatrical bow

Do you think me so weak a thing as your words imply

Rather so strong that the glory of overcoming yu fills me with joy
Believe me madam though your master I am not less your slave he
mocked

You are neither my master nor my slave but a thing I detest she
said in a low voice that carried extraordinary intensity

And obey he added suavely Come madam to horse for our
honeymoon

I tell you I shall not go

Then in faith well reenact a modern edition of The Taming of the
Shrew Yull find me sweet as apt at the part as old Petruchio He
paced complacently up the room and back and quoted glibly

And thus Ill curb her mad and headstrong humor He that knows better
how to tame a shrew Now let him speak tis charity to show

Would you take me against my will

Yu have said it Whats your will to me What I want I take And I
sure want my beautiful shrew His halfshuttered eyes gloated on her as
he rattled off a couple more lines from the play he had mentioned

Kate like the hazeltwig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
As hazelnuts and sweeter than the kernels

She let a swift glance travel anxiously to the door You are in a very
poetical mood today

As befits a bridegroom my own He stepped lightly to the window and
tapped twice on the pane A signal to bring the horses round If yu
have any preparations to make any trousseau to prepare yu better set
that girl of yours to work

I have no preparations to make

Coming to me simply as yu are Good Well lead the simple life

Nora as it chanced knocked and entered at his moment The sight of
her vivid good looks truck him for the first time At sight of him
she stopped gazing with parted lips a double row of pearls shining
through

He turned swiftly to the mistress Yu ought not to be alone there
among so many men It wouldnt be proper Well take the girl along with
us

Where Noras parted lips emitted

To Arden my dear He interrupted himself to look at his watch I
wonder why that fellow doesnt come with the horses They should pass
this window

Bannister standing jauntily with his feet astride as he looked out
of the window heard someone enter the room Did yu bring round the
horses he snapped without looking round

NO WE ALLOWED THEY WOULDNT BE NEEDED

At sound of the slow drawl the outlaw wheeled like a flash his hand
traveling to the hilt of the revolver that hung on his hip But he was
too late Already two revolvers covered him and he knew that both his
cousin and McWilliams were dead shots He flashed one venomous look at
the mistress of the ranch

Yu fooled me again That lamp business was a signal and I was too
thickhaided to see it My compliments to yu Miss Messiter

Yu are under arrest announced his cousin

Yu dont say His voice was full of sarcastic admiration And you
done it with your little gun My what a wonder yu are

Take your hand from the butt of that gun Yu better relieve him of
it Mac Hes got such a restless disposition he might commit suicide by
reaching for it

What do yu think youre going to do with me now yu have got me
Cousin Ned

Were going to turn yu over to the United States Government

Guess again I have a thing or two to say to that

Youre going to Gimlet Butte with us alive or dead

The outlaw intentionally misunderstood If Ive got to take yu then
well say yu go dead rather than alive

He was going to take Nora and me with him Helen explained to her
friends

Instantly the man swung round on her But now Ive changed my mind
maam Im going to take my cousin with me instead of yu ladies

Helen caught his meaning first and flashed it whitely to her lover It
dawned on him more slowly

I see yu remember Miss Messiter he continued with a cruel silken
laugh He gave me his parole to go with me whenever I said the word
Im saying it now He sat down astride a chair put his chin on the
back crossbar and grinned malevolently from one to another

Whats come over this happy family It dont look so joyous all of a
sudden Yu dont need to worry maam Ill send him back to yu all
rightalive or dead With his shield or on it yu know Ha ha

You will not go with him It was wrung from Helen as a low cry and
struck her lovers heart

I must he answered I gave him my word yu remember

But why keep it You know what he is how absolutely devoid of honor

That is not quite the question is it he smiled

Would he keep his word to you

Not if a lie would do as well But that isnt the point either

Its quixoticfoolishworse than thatridiculous she implored

Perhaps but the fact remains that I am pledged

 I could not love thee dear so much
 Loved I not honor more

murmured the villain in the chair apparently to the ceiling Dear Ned
he always was the soul of honor Ill have those lines carved on his
tombstone

You see He is already bragging that he means to kill you said the
girl

I shall go armed the sheepman answered

Yes but he will take you into the mountain fastnesses where the men
that serve him will do his bidding What is one man among so many

Two men maam corrected the foreman

Whats that The outlaw broke off the snatch of opera he was singing
to slew his head round at McWilliams

I said two Any objections seh

Yes That wasnt in the contract

Were giving yu surplusage thats all Yu wanted one of us and yu
get two We dont charge anything for the extra weight grinned Mac

Oh Mac will you go with him cried Helen with shining eyes

Those are my present intentions Miss Helen laughed her foreman

Whereat Nora emerged from the background and flung herself on him Yu
cant go Jim I wont have you go she cried

The young man blushed a beautiful pink and accepted gladly this overt
evidence of a reconciliation Its all right honey Dont yu think
two big grownup men are good to handle that scalawag Sho Dont yu
worry

Miss Nora can come too if she likes suggested he of the Shoshones
Looks like we would have quite a party Wont yu join us too
Miss Messiter according to the original plan he said extending an
ironical invitation

I think we had better cut it down to me alone Well not burden your
hospitality sir said the sheepman

No sir Im in on this Whyfor cant I go demanded Jim

Bannister the outlaw eyed him unpleasantly Yu certainly can so far
as I am concerned I owe yu one too Mr McWilliams Only if yu come
of your own free will as yu are surely welcome to do dont holler if
yure not so welcome to leave whenever yu take a notion

Ill try and look out for that Its settled then that we ride
together When do yu want to start

We cant go any sooner than right now I hate to take these young
men from yu lady but as I said Ill send them back in good shape
Adios senorita Dont forget to whom yu belong He swaggered to the
door and turned leaning against the jamb with one hand again it I
expect yu can say those loveydov goodbyes without my help Im going
into the yard If yu want to yu can plug me in the back through the
window he suggested with a sneer

As yu would us under similar circumstances retorted his cousin

Be with yu in five minutes said the foreman

Dont hurry Its a long goodbye yure saying returned his enemy
placidly

Nora and the young man who belonged to her followed him from the room
leaving Bannister and his hostess alone

Shall I ever see you again Helen murmured

I think so the sheepman answered The truth is that this opportunity
falls pat Jim and have been wanting to meet those men who are under my
cousins influence and have a talk with them There is no question
but that the gang is disintegrating and I believe that if we offer to
mediate between its members and the Government something might be done
to stop the outrages that have been terrorizing this country My cousin
cant be reached but I believe the rest of them or at least a part
can be induced either to surrender or to flee the country Anyhow we
want to try it

But the danger she breathed

Is less than yu think Their leader has not anywhere nearly the
absolute power he had a few months ago They would hardly dare do
violence to a peace envoy

Your cousin would I dont believe he has any scruples

We shall keep an eye on him Both of us will not sleep at the same
time Yu may depend on me to bring your foreman safely back to yu he
smiled

Oh my foreman

And your foremans friend he added I have the best of reasons for
wanting to return alive I think yu know them They have to do with
yu Miss Helen

It had come at last but womanlike she evaded the issue her heart had
sought Yes I know You think it would not be fair to throw away your
life in this foolish manner after I have saved it for youhow many
times was it you said The blue eyes lifted with deceptive frankness to
the gray ones

No that isnt my reason I have a better one than that I love yu
girl more than anything in this world

And so you try to prove it to me by running into a trap set for you to
take your life Thats a selfish kind of love isnt it Or it would be
if I loved you

Do yu love me Helen

Why should I tell you since you dont love me enough to give up this
quixotic madness

Dont yu see dear I cant give it up

I see you wont You care more for your pride than for me

No it isnt that Ive got to go It isnt that I want to leave yu
God knows But Ive given my word and I must keep it Do yu want me
to be a quitter and yu so game yourself Do yu want it to go all over
this cattle country that I gave my word and took it back because I lost
my nerve

The boy that takes a dare isnt a hero is he Theres a higher courage
that refuses to be drawn into such foolishness that doesnt give way to
the jeers of the empty headed

I dont think that is a parallel case Im sorry we cant see this
alike but Ive got to go ahead the way that seems to me right


Youre going to leave me then to go with that man

Yes if thats the way yu have to put it He looked at her
sorrowfully and added gently I thought you would see it I thought
sure you would

But she could not bear that he should leave her so and she cried out
after him Oh I see it I know you must go but I cant bear it Her
head buried itself in his coat It isnt rightit isnt aa square
deal that you should go away now the very minute you belong to me

A happy smile shone in his eyes I belong to you do I Thats good
hearing girl o mine His arm went round her and he stroked the black
head softly Ill not be gone long dear Dont yu worry about me
Ill be back with yu soon just as soon as I have finished this piece
of work I have to do

But if you should getif anything should happen to you

Nothing is going to happen to me There is a special providence looks
after lovers yu know

Be careful Ned of yourself For my sake dear

Ill dry my socks every time I get my feet wet for fear of taking
cold he laughed

But you will wont you

Ill be very careful Helen he promised more gravely

Even then she could hardly let him go clinging to him with a reluctance
to separate that was a new experience to her independent vigorous
youth In the end he unloosened her arm kissed her once and hurried
out of the room In the hallway he met McWilliams also hurryin out from
a tearful farewell on the part of Nora

Bannister the outlaw already mounted was waiting for them Yu did
get through at last he drawled insolently Well if yull kindly give
orders to your sevenfoot dwarf to point the Winchester another way Ill
collect my men an well be moving

For though the outlaw had left his men in command of the ranch when he
went into the house he found the situation reversed on his return
With the arrival of reinforcements in the persons of McWilliams and his
friend it had been the turn of the raiders to turn over their weapons

All right Denver nodded the foreman

The outlaw chief whistled for his men and with their guests they rode
into the silent desert night



CHAPTER 22 EXIT THE KING

They bedded that night under the great vaultroof where twinkle a
million stars

There were three of the outlaws men with him and both Mcwilliams and
his friend noticed that they slept a little apart from their chief
There were other indications among the rustlers of a camp divided
against itself Bannisters orders to them he contrived to make an
insult and their obedience was as surly as possible compatible with
safety For all of the men knew that he would not hesitate to shoot them
down in one of his violent rages should they anger him sufficiently

Throughout the night there was no time that at least two men were not
awake in the camp The foreman and the sheepman took turns keeping
vigil and on the other side of the fire sat one of the rustlers in
silent watchfulness To the man opposite him each of the sentinels were
outposts of the enemy but they fraternized after the manner of army
sentries exchanging tobacco and occasional casual conversation

The foreman took the first turn and opposite him sat a oneeyed old
scoundrel who had rustle calves from big outfits ever since Wyoming was
a territory and long before Chalkeye Dave he was called and sometimes
merely Chalkeye What his real name was no man knew Nor was his past a
subject for conversation in his presence It was known that he had been
in the Nevada penitentiary and that he had killed a man in Arizona but
these details of an active life were rarely resurrected For Chalkeye
was deadly on the shoot and was ready for it at the drop of the
hat though he had his good points too One of these was a remarkable
fondness for another member of the party a mere lad called by his
companions Hughie Generally surly and morose to such a degree that
even his chief was careful to humor him as a rule when with Hughie all
the softer elements of his character came to the surface In his rough
way he was ever humorous and genial

Jim McWilliams found him neither however He declined to engage in
conversation accepted a proffer of tobacco with a silent hostile grunt
and relapsed into a long silence that lasted till his shift was ended

Hate to have yu leave old man Yure so darned good company Ill
cetainly pine for you the foreman suggested with sarcasm when
the old man rolled up in his blankets preparatory to falling asleep
immediately

Chalkeyes successor was a blatant youth much impressed with his own
importance He was both foulmouthed and foulminded so that Jim
was constrained to interrupt his evil boastings by pretending to fall
asleep

It was nearly two oclock when the foreman aroused his friend to take
his turn Shortly after this the lad Hughie relieved the bragging
wouldbe bad man

Hughie was a flaxenhaired rather goodlooking boy of nineteen In his
small wistful face was not a line of wickedness though it was plain
that he was weak He seemed so unfit for the life he was leading that
the sheepmans interest was aroused For on the frontier it takes a
strong competent miscreant to be a bad man and survive Ineffectives
and weaklings are quickly weeded out to their graves or the
penitentiaries

The boy was manifestly under great fear of his chief but the curly
haired young Hermes who kept watch with him had a very winning smile and
a charming manner when he cared to exert it Almost in spite of himself
the youngster was led to talk It seemed that he had but lately joined
the TetonShoshones outfit of desperadoes and between the lines
Bannister easily read that his cousins masterful compulsion had coerced
the young fellow All he wanted was an opportunity to withdraw in
safety but he knew he could never do this so long as the King was
alive and at liberty

Under the starroof in the chill breaking day Ned Bannister talked to
him long and gently It was easy to bring the boy to tears but it was
harder thing to stiffen a will that was of putty and to hearten a soul
in mortal fear But he set himself with all the power in him to combat
the influence of his cousin over this boy and before the camp stirred
to life again he knew that he had measurably succeeded

They ate breakfast in the gray dawn under the stars and after they had
finished their coffee and bacon horses were saddled and the trail
taken up again It led in and out among the foothills slopping
upward gradually toward the first long blue line of the Shoshones that
stretched before them in the distance Their nooning was at running
stream called Smiths Creek and by nightfall the party was well up in
the higher foot hills

In the course of the day and the second night both the sheepman and
his friend made attempt to establish a more cordial relationship with
Chalkeye but so far as any apparent results went their efforts were
vain He refused grimly to meet their overtures half way even though it
was plain from his manner that a break between him and his chief could
not long be avoided

All day by crooked trails they pushed forward and as the party advanced
into the mountains the gloom of the mournful pines and frowning peaks
invaded its spirits Suspicion and distrust went with it camped at
night by the rushing mountain stream lay down to sleep in the shadows
at every mans shoulder For each man looked with an ominous eye on his
neighbor watchful of every sudden move of every careless word that
might convey a sudden meaning

Along a narrow rockrim trail far above a steep canon whose walls shot
precipitously down they were riding in single file when the outlaw
chief pushed his horse forward between the road wall and his cousins
bronco The sheepman immediately fell back

I reckon this trail isnt wide enough for twounless yu take the
outside he explained quietly

The outlaw who had been drinking steadily ever since leaving the Lazy
D laughed his low sinister cackle Afraid of me are yu Afraid Ill
push yu off

Not when Im inside and you dont have chance

Twas a place about like this I drove for thousand of your sheep over
last week With sheep worth what they are Im afraid it must have
cost yu quite a bit Not that yull miss it where you are going he
hastened to add

It was very like you to revenge yourself on dumb animals

Think so The Kings black gaze rested on him Yull sing a
different song soon Mr Bannister Its humans Ill drive next time and
dont yu forget it

If you get the chance amended his cousin gently

Ill get the chance Im not worrying about that And about those
sheepany man that hasnt got more sense than to run sheep in a cow
country ought to lose them for his pigheadedness

Those sheep were on the right side of the deadline You had to cross
it to reach them Their owners steady eyes challenged a denial

Is that so Now how do yu know that We didnt leave the herder alive
to explain that to yu did we

You admit murdering him

To yu dear cousin Yu see I have a hunch that maybe yull go join
your herder right soon Yull not do much talking

The sheepman fell back I think Ill ride alone

Rage flared in the others eye Too good for me are yu my
mealymouthed cousin Yu always thought yourself better than me When
yu were a boy you used to go sneaking to that old hypocrite your
grandfather

You have said enough interrupted the other sternly Ill not hear
another word Keep your foul tongue off him

Their eyes silently measured strength

Yull not hear a word sneered the chief of the rustlers What will
yu do dear cousin

Stand up and fight like a man and settle this thing once for all

Still their steely eyes crossed as with the thrust of rapiers The
challenged man crouched tensely with a mighty longing for the test
but he had planned a more elaborate revenge and a surer one than this
Reluctantly he shook his head

Why should I Yure mine Were four to two and soon well be a dozen
to two Id like a heap to oblige yu but I reckon I cant afford to
just now Yu will have to wait a little for that bumping off thats
coming to yu

In that event Ill trouble you not to inflict your society on me any
more than is necessary

Thats all right too If yu think I enjoy your conversation yu have
got another guess coming

So by mutual consent the sheepman fell in behind the blatant youth who
had wearied McWilliams so and rode in silence

It was again getting close to nightfall The slant sun was throwing its
rays on less and less of the trail They could see the shadows grow and
the coolness of night sift into the air They were pushing on to pass
the rim of a great valley basin that lay like a saucer in the mountains
in order that they might camp in the valley by a stream all of them
knew Dusk was beginning to fall when they at last reached the saucer
edge and only the opposite peaks were still tipped with the sun rays
This too disappeared before they had descended far and the gloom of
the great mountains that girt the valley was on all their spirits even
McWilliams being affected by it

They were tired with travel and the long night watches did not improve
tempers already overstrained with the expectation of a crisis too long
dragged out Rain fell during the night and continued gently in a misty
drizzle after day broke It was a situation and an atmosphere ripe for
tragedy and it fell on them like a clap of thunder out of a sodden sky

Hughie was cook for the day and he came chill and stifffingered to his
task Summer as it was there lay a thin coating of ice round the edges
of the stream for they had camped in an altitude of about nine thousand
feet The King had wakened in a vile humor He had a splitting
headache as was natural under the circumstances and he had not left in
his bottle a single drink to tide him over it He came cursing to the
struggling fire which was making only fitful headway against the rain
which beat down upon it

Why didnt yu build your fire on the side of the tree he growled at
Hughie

Now Hughie was a tenderfoot and in his knowledge of outdoor life he
was still an infant I didnt know he was beginning when his master
cut him short with a furious tongue lashing out of all proportion to the
offense

The lads face blanched with fear and his terror was so manifest that
the bully who was threatening him with all manner of evils began to
enjoy himself Chalkeye returning from watering the horses got back
in time to hear the intemperate fagend of the scolding He glanced at
Hughie whose hands were trembling in spite of him and then darkly at
the brute who was attacking him But he said not a word

The meal proceeded in silence except for jeers and taunts of the King
For nobody cared to venture conversation which might prove a match to
a powder magazine Whatever thoughts might be each man kept them to
himself

Coffee snapped the single talker toward end of breakfast

Hughie jumped up filled the cup that was handed him and set the coffee
pot back on fire As he handed the tin cup with the coffee to the outlaw
the lads foot slipped on a piece wet wood and the hot liquid splashed
over his chiefs leg The man jumped to his feet in a rage and struck
the boy across the face with his whip once and then again

By God thatll do for you cried Chalkeye from the other side of the
fire springing revolver in hand Draw you coyote I come ashooting

The King wheeled finding his weapon he turned Two shots rang out
almost simultaneously and Chalkeye pitched forward The outlaw chief
sank to his knees and with one hand resting on the ground to steady
himself fired two more shots into the twitching body on the other side
of the fire Then he too lurched forward and rolled over

It had come to climax so swiftly that not one of them had moved except
the combatants Bannister rose and walked over to the place where the
body of his cousin lay He knelt down and examined him When he rose it
was with a very grave face

He is dead he said quietly

McWilliams who had been bending over Chalkeye looked up Here too
Any one of the shots would have finished him

Bannister nodded Yes That first exchange killed them both He looked
down at the limp body of his cousin but a minute before so full of
supple virile life But his hate had to reach out and make sure even
though he was as good as dead himself He was game Then sharply to the
young braggart who had risen and was edging away with a face of
chalk Sit down yu What do yu take us for Think this is to be a
massacre

The man came back with palpable hesitancy I was aiming to go and get
the boys to bury them My God did you ever see anything so quick They
drilled through each other like lightning

Mac looked him over with dry contempt My friend yure too tender for
a genuwine A1 bad man If I was handing yu a bunch of advice it would
be to get back to the prosaic paths of peace right prompt And while
were on the subject Ill borrow your guns Yure scared stiff and it
might get into your fool coconut to plug one of us and light out Id
hate to see yu commit suicide right before us so Ill just natcherally
unload yu

He was talking to lift the strain and it was for the same purpose that
Bannister moved over to Hughie who sat with his face in his hands
trying to shut out the horror of what he had seen

The sheepman dropped a hand on his shoulder gently Brace up boy
Dont you see that the very best thing that could have happened is this
Its best for yu best for the rest of the gang and best for the whole
cattle country Well have peace here at last Now hes gone honest men
are going to breathe easy Ill take yu in hand and set yu at work on
one of my stations if yu like Anyhow youll have a chance to begin
life again in a better way

Thats right agreed the blatant youth Im sick of rustling the
mails and other folks calves Im glad he got what was coming to him
he concluded vindictively with a glance at his dead chief and a sudden
raucous oath

McWilliamss cold blue eye transfixed him Hadnt you better be a little
careful how your mouth goes off For one thing hes daid now and for
another he happens to be Mr Bannisters cousin

Butwerent they enemies

Thats how I understand it But this mans passed over the range A MAN
doesnt unload his hatred on dead folksand I expect if yull study
him even yu will be able to figure out that my friend measures up to
the size of a real man

I dont see why if

No I dont suppose yu do interrupted the foreman turning on his
heel Then to Bannister who was looking down at his cousin with a stony
face I reckon Bann we better make arrangements to have the bodies
buried right here in the valley he said gently

Bannister was thinking of early days of the time when this miscreant
whose light had just been put out so instantaneously had played with
him day in and day out They had attended their first school together
had played marbles and prisoners base a hundred times against each
other He could remember how they used to get up early in the morning to
go fishing with each other And later when each began unconsciously
to choose the path he would follow in already beginning to settle into
an established fact He could see now by looking back on trifles of
their childhood that his cousin had been badly handicapped in his
fight with himself against the evil in him He had inherited depraved
instincts and tastes and with them somewhere in him a strand of
weakness that prevented him from slaying the giants he had to oppose in
the making of a good character From bad to worse he had gone and here
he lay with the drizzling rain on his white face a warning and a lesson
to wayward youths just setting their feet in the wrong direction Surely
it was kismet

Ned Bannister untied the handkerchief from his neck and laid it across
the face of his kinsman A moment longer he looked down then passed
his hands across his eyes and seemed to brush away the memories that
thronged him He stepped forward to the fire and warmed his hands

Well go on Mac to the rendezvous he had appointed with his outfit
We ought to reach there by noon and the boys can send a wagon back to
get the bodies



CHAPTER 23 JOURNEYS END IN LOVERS MEETING

It had been six days since the two Ned Bannisters had ridden away
together into the mountains and every waking hour since that time had
been for Helen one of harassing anxiety No word had yet reached her of
the issue of that dubious undertaking and she both longed and dreaded
to hear He had promised to send a messenger as soon as he had anything
definite to tell but she knew it would be like his cousin too to
send her some triumphant word should he prove the victor in the struggle
between them So that every stranger she glimpsed brought to her a
sudden beating of the heart

But it was not the nature of Helen Messiter to sit down and give herself
up a prey to foreboding Her active nature cried out for work to occupy
her and distract her attention Fortunately this was to be had in
abundance just now For the autumn roundup was on and since her
foreman was away the mistress of the Lazy D found plenty of work ready
to her hand

The meeting place for the roundup riders was at Boom Creek five miles
from the ranch and Helen rode out there to take charge of her own
interests in person With her were six riders and for the use of each
of them in addition to his present mount three extra ponies were brought
in the remuda For the riding is so hard during the roundup that a
horse can stand only one day in four of it At the appointed rendezvous
a score of other cowboys and owners met them Without any delay they
proceeded to business Mr Bob Austin better known as Texas was
elected boss of the roundup and he immediately assigned the men to
their places and announced that they would work Squaw Creek They moved
camp at once Helen returning to the ranch

It was three oclock in the morning when the men were roused by the
cooks triangle calling them to the chuck wagon for breakfast It was
still cold and dark as the boys crawled from under their blankets and
squatted round the fire to eat jerky biscuits and gravy and to drink
cupfuls of hot black coffee Before sun rose every man was at his post
far up on the Squaw Creek ridges ready to begin the drive

Later in the day Helen rode to the parade grounds toward which a
stream of cattle was pouring down the canyon of the creek Every gulch
tributary to the creek contributed its quota of wild cows and calves
These came romping down the canyon mouth where four picked men with a
bunch of tame cows in front of them stopped the rush of flying cattle
Lunch was omitted and branding began at once Every calf belonging to
a Lazy D cow after being roped and tied was flanked with the great D
which indicated its ownership by Miss Messiter and on account of the
recumbent position of which letter the ranch had its name

It was during the branding that a boyish young fellow rode up and handed
Helen a note Her heart pumped rapidly with relief for one glance told
her that it was in the handwriting of the Ned Bannister she loved She
tore it open and glanced swiftly through it

DEAR FRIEND Two hours ago my cousin was killed by one of his own men
I am sending back to you a boy who had been led astray by him and it
would be a great service to me if you would give him something to do
till I return His name is Hugh Rogers I think if you trust him he will
prove worthy of it

Jim and I are going to stay here a few days longer to finish the
work that is begun We hope to meet and talk with as many of the men
implicated in my cousins lawlessness as is possible What the result
will be I cannot say We do not consider ourselves in any danger
whatever though we are not taking chances If all goes well we shall be
back within a few days

I hope you are not missing Jim too much at the roundup Sincerely

NED BANNISTER

She liked the letter because there was not a hint of the relationship
between them to be read in it He had guarded her against the chance of
its falling into the wrong hands and creating talk about them

She turned to Hughie Can you ride

In a way maam I cant ride like these men His glance indicated a
cowpuncher pounding past after a wild steer that had broken through the
cordon of riders and was trying to get away

Do you want to learn

Id like to if I had a chance he answered wistfully

All right You have your chance Ill see that Mr Austin finds
something for you to do From today you are in my employ

She rode back to the ranch in the late afternoon while the sun was
setting in a great splash of crimson The roundup boss had hinted that
if she were nervous about riding alone he could find it convenient to
accompany her But the girl wanted to be alone with her own thoughts
and she had slipped away while he was busy cutting out calves from
the herd It had been a wonderful relief to her to find that HER Ned
Bannister was the one that had survived in the conflict and her heart
sang a paean of joy as she rode into the golden glow of the westering
sun He was aliveto love and be loved The unlived years of her future
seemed to unroll before her as a vision She glowed with a resurgent
happiness that was almost an ecstasy The words of a bit of verse she
had once seena mere scrap from a magazine that had stuck in an obscure
corner of her memorysang again and again in her heart

Life and love And a bright sky oer us AndGod take care Of the way
before us

Ah the way before them before her and her romanceradiating hero
It might be rough and hilly but if they trod it togetherHer tangled
thoughts were off again in another glad leap of imagination

The days passed somehow She busied herself with the affairs of the
ranch rode out often to the scenes of the cattle drives and watched the
roundup and every twentyfour hours brought her one day nearer to
his return she told herself Nora too was on the lookout under her
longlashed roguish eyelids and the two young women discussed the
subject of their lovers return in that elusive elliptical way common
to their sex

No doubt each of these young women had conjectured as to the manner of
that homecoming and the meeting that would accompany it but it is safe
to say that neither of them guessed in her daydreams how it actually
was to occur

Nora had been eager to see something of the roundup and as she was no
horsewoman her mistress took her out one day in her motor The drive
had been that day on Bronco Mesa and had finished in the natural corral
made by Bear Canon fenced with a cordon of riders at the end opening
to the plains below After watching for two hours the busy scenes of
cutting out roping and branding Helen wheeled her car and started down
the canyon on their return

Now a herd of wild cattle is uncertain as an April days behavior
Under the influence of the tame valley cattle among which they are
driven after a little milling around the whole bunch may gentle almost
immediately or on the other hand it may break through and go crashing
away on a wild stampede at a moments notice Every experienced cowman
knows enough to expect the unexpected

At Bronco Mesa the roundup had proceeded with unusual facility Scores
of wiry longlegged steers had drifted down the ridges or gulches that
led to the canon and many a cow followed by its calf had stumbled
forward to the herd and apparently accepted the inevitable But before
Helen Messiter had well started out of the canyons mouth the situation
changed absolutely

A big hill steer which had not seen a man for a year broke through
the human corral with a bellow near a point where Reddy kept guard The
puncher wheeled and gave chase Before the other men could close the
opening a couple of twoyearolds seized the opportunity and followed
its lead A second rider gave chase and at once as if some imp of
mischief had stirred them fifty tails went up in wild flight Another
minute and the whole herd was in stampede

Down the gulch the five hundred cattle thundered toward the motor car
which lay directly in their path Helen turned appreciated the danger
and put the machine at its full speed The road branched for a space
of about fifty yards and in her excitement she made the mistake of
choosing the lower more level one Into a deep sand bed they plowed
the wheels sinking at every turn Slower and slower went the car
finally came to a full stop

Nora glanced back in affright at the two hundred and fifty tons of beef
that was charging wildly toward them What shall we do she gasped
and clambered to the ground

Run cried Helen following her example and scudding for the sides
of the canyon which here sloped down less precipitately than at other
points But before they had run a dozen steps each of them was aware
that they could not reach safety in time to escape the hoofs rushing
toward them so heavily that the ground quaked

Look out A resonant cry rang out above the dull thud of the
stampeding cattle that were almost upon them Down the steep sides of
the gorge two riders were galloping recklessly It was a race for life
between them and the first of the herd and they won by scarce more than
a length Across the sand the horses plowed and as they swept past
the two trembling young women each rider bent from the saddle without
slackening speed and snatched one almost from under the very hoofs of
the leaders

The danger was not past As the horses swerved and went forward with the
rush Helen knew that a stumble would fling not only her and the man who
had saved her but also the horse down to death They must contrive
to hold their own in that deadly rush until a way could be found of
escaping from the path of the living cyclone that trod at their heels
galloped beside them in front behind

For it came to her that the horse was tiring in that rush through the
sand with double weight upon its back

Courage cried the man behind her as her fearful eyes met his

As he spoke they reached the end of the canyon and firm ground
simultaneously Helen saw that her rescuer had now a revolver in his
hand and that he was firing in such a way as to deflect the leaders
to the left At first the change in course was hardly perceptible but
presently she noticed that they were getting closer to the outskirts of
the herd working gradually to the extreme right edging inch by inch
ever so warily toward safety Going parallel to their course
running neck and neck with the cow pony lumbered a great dun steer
Unconsciously it blocked every effort of the horseman to escape He had
one shot left in his revolver and this time he did not fire into the
air It was a mighty risk for the animal in falling might stagger
against the horse and hunt them all down to death But the man took it
without apparent hesitation Into the ear of the bullock he sent the
lead crashing The brute stumbled and went down head over heels Its
flying hoofs struck the flanks of the pony but the bronco stuck to its
feet and next moment staggered out from among the herd stragglers and
came to halt

The man slid from its back and lifted down the halffainting girl She
clung to him white a trembling Oh it was horrible Ned She could
still look down in imagination upon the sea of dun backs that swayed and
surged about them like stormtossed waves

It was a near thing but we made it girl So did Jim He got out
before we did Its all past now You can remember it as the most
exciting experience of your life

She shuddered I dont want to remember it at all And so shaken was
she that she did not realize that his arm was about her the while she
sobbed on his shoulder

A cattle stampede is a nasty thing to get in front of Never mind Its
done with now and everybodys safe

She drew a long breath Yes everybodys safe and you are back home
Why didnt you come after your cousin was killed

I had to finish my work

And DID you finish it

I think we did There will be no more Shoshone gang Its members have
scatted in all directions

Im glad you stayed then We can live at peace now And presently she
added I knew you would not come back until you had done what you set
out to do Youre very obstinate sir Do you know that

Perseverance I call it he smiled glad to see that she was
recovering her lightness of tone

You dont always insist on putting your actions in the most favorable
light Do you remember the first day I ever saw you

Am I likely ever to forget it he smiled fondly

I didnt mean THAT What I was getting at was that you let me go away
from you thinking you were the king I havent forgiven you entirely
for that

I expect yull always have to be forgiving me things

If you valued my good opinion I dont see how you could let me go
without telling me Was it fair or kind

If yu come to that was it so fair and kind to convict me so promptly
on suspicion he retaliated with a smile

No it wasnt But She flushed with a divine shyness But I loved
you all the time even when they said you were a villain

Even while yu believed me one

I didnt I never would believe you onenot deep in my heart I
wouldnt let myself I made excuses for youexplained everything to
myself

Yet your reason told yu I was guilty

Yes I think my mind hated you and my heart loved you

He adored her for the frank simplicity of her confession that out of
the greatness of her love she dared to make no secret of it to him
Direct as a boy she was yet as wholly sweet as the most retiring girl
could be

Yu always swamp my vocabulary sweetheart I cant ever tell yulife
wouldnt be long enoughhow much I care for you

Im glad she said simply

They stood looking at each other palms pressed to palms in meeting
hands supremely happy in this miracle of love that had befallen them
They were alonefor Nora and Jim had gone into temporary eclipse behind
a hill and seemed in no hurry to emergealone in the sunshine with this
wonder that flowed from one to another by shining eyes by finger touch
and then by meeting lips He held her close knew the sweet delight of
contact with the supple surrendered figure then released her as she
drew away in maidenly reserve

When shall we be married Helen Is the early part of next week too
late he asked

Still blushing she straightened her hat Thats ridiculous sir I
havent got used to the thought of you yet

Plenty of time for that afterward Then well say next week if that
suits yu

But it doesnt Dont you know that it is the ladys privilege to name
the day Besides I want time to change my mind if I should decide to

Thats what Im afraid of he laughed joyfully So I have to insist
on an early marriage

Insist she demurred

Ive been told on the best of authority that Im very obstinate he
gayly answered

I have a mind of my own myself If I ever marry you be sure I shall
name the day sir

Will yu marry me the day Nora does Jim

Well see The eyes slanted at him under the curved lashes teased him
delightfully Did Nora tell you she was going to marry Jim

Bannister looked mildly hurt My common sense has been telling it to me
a month

How long has your common sense been telling you about us

I didnt use it when I fell in love with yu he boldly laughed

Of all things to say
