HISTORY


This three volume etext set comes from multiple editions of Challoners
revised DouayRheims Version of the Holy Bible The division of the Old
Testaments into two parts follows the two tome format of the 16091610
printing of the Old Testament In 1568 English exiles many from
Oxford established the English College of Douay DouaiDoway Flanders
under William later Cardinal Allen In October 1578 Gregory Martin
began the work of preparing an English translation of the Bible for
Catholic readers the first such translation into Modern English
Assisting were William Allen Richard Bristow Thomas Worthington and
William Reynolds who revised criticized and corrected Dr Martins
work The college published the New Testament at Rheims ReimsRhemes
France in 1582 through John Fogny with a preface and explanatory notes
authored chiefly by Bristol Allen and Worthington Later the Old
Testament was published at Douay in two parts 1609 and 1610 by Laurence
Kellam through the efforts of Dr Worthington then superior of the
seminary The translation had been prepared before the appearance of the
New Testament but the publication was delayed due to financial
difficulties The religious and scholarly adherence to the Latin Vulgate
text led to the less elegant and idiomatic words and phrases often found
in the translation In some instances where no English word conveyed the
full meaning of the Latin a Latin word was Anglicized and its meaning
defined in a glossary Although ridiculed by critics many of these
words later found common usage in the English language Spellings of
proper names and the numbering of the Psalms are adopted from the Latin
Vulgate

In 1749 Dr Richard Challoner began a major revision of the Douay and
Rheims texts the spellings and phrasing of which had become increasingly
archaic in the almost two centuries since the translations were first
produced He modernized the diction and introduced a more fluid style
while faithfully maintaining the accuracy of Dr Martins texts This
revision became the de facto standard text for English speaking
Catholics until the twentieth century It is still highly regarded by
many for its style although it is now rarely used for liturgical
purposes The notes included in this electronic edition are generally
attributed to Bishop Challoner

The 1610 printing of the second tome of the Old Testament includes an
appendix containing the noncanonical books Prayer of Manasses Third
Booke of Esdras and Fourth Booke of Esdras While not part of
Challoners revision the 1610 texts are placed in the appendices of
Vol II of this etext set Also included are the original texts of two
short books The Prophecie of Abdias Vol II and The Catholike
Epistle of Iude the Apostle Vol III to give the reader a sense of
the language of the first editions in comparison to the Challoner
revision Further background on the DouayRheims version may be found in
a selection from the preface to the 1582 edition and the original
glossary included in the appendices of Vol III

THE BOOK OF PSALMS



The psalms are called by the Hebrews TEHILLIM that is Hymns of
Praise The author of a great part of them at least was king David
but many are of opinion that some of them were made by Asaph and
others whose names are prefixed in the titles



Psalms Chapter 1


Beatus vir

The happiness of the just and the evil state of the wicked

11 Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the
ungodly nor stood in the way of sinners nor sat in the chair of
pestilence

12 But his will is in the law of the Lord and on his law he shall
meditate day and night

13 And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running
waters which shall bring forth its fruit in due season And his leaf
shall not fall off and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper

14 Not so the wicked not so but like the dust which the wind
driveth from the face of the earth

15 Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment nor sinners
in the council of the just

16 For the Lord knoweth the way of the just and the way of the
wicked shall perish



Psalms Chapter 2


Quare fremuerunt

The vain efforts of persecutors against Christ and his church

21 Why have the Gentiles raged and the people devised vain things

22 The kings of the earth stood up and the princes met together
against the Lord and against his Christ

23 Let us break their bonds asunder and let us cast away their yoke
from us

24 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them and the Lord shall
deride them

25 Then shall he speak to them in his anger and trouble them in his
rage

26 But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain
preaching his commandment

27 The Lord hath said to me Thou art my son this day have I
begotten thee

28 Ask of me and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance
and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession

29 Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron and shalt break them in
pieces like a potters vessel

210 And now O ye kings understand receive instruction you that
judge the earth

211 Serve ye the Lord with fear and rejoice unto him with trembling

212 Embrace discipline lest at any time the Lord be angry and you
perish from the just way

213 When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time blessed are all
they that trust in him



Psalms Chapter 3


Domine quid multiplicati

The prophets danger and delivery from his son Absalom mystically the
passion and resurrection of Christ

31 The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom

32 Many say to my soul There is no salvation for him in his God

34 But thou O Lord art my protector my glory and the lifter up of
my head

35 I have cried to the Lord with my voice and he hath heard me from
his holy hill

36 I have slept and have taken my rest and I have risen up because
the Lord hath protected me

37 I will not fear thousands of the people surrounding me arise O
Lord save me O my God

38 For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without
cause thou hast broken the teeth of sinners

39 Salvation is of the Lord and thy blessing is upon thy people



Psalms Chapter 4


Cum invocarem

The prophet teacheth us to flee to God in tribulation with confidence
in him

41 Unto the end in verses A psalm for David

Unto the end  Or as St Jerome renders it victori to him that
overcometh which some understand of the chief musician to whom they
suppose the psalms which bear that title were given to be sung we
rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ who is
the end of the law and the great conqueror of death and hell and to
the New TestamentIbid In verses in carminibus  In the Hebrew it
is neghinoth supposed by some to be a musical instrument with which
this psalm was to be sungIbid For David or to David  That is
inspired to David himself or to be sung

42 When I called upon him the God of my justice heard me when I was
in distress thou hast enlarged me Have mercy on me and hear my
prayer

43 O ye sons of men how long will you be dull of heart why do you
love vanity and seek after lying

44 Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful the
Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him

45 Be ye angry and sin not the things you say in your hearts be
sorry for them upon your beds

46 Offer up the sacrifice of justice and trust in the Lord many
say Who sheweth us good things

47 The light of thy countenance O Lord is signed upon us thou hast
given gladness in my heart

48 By the fruit of their corn their wine and oil they rest

49 In peace in the self same I will sleep and I will rest

410 For thou O Lord singularly hast settled me in hope



Psalms Chapter 5


Verba mea auribul

A prayer to God against the iniquities of men

51 Unto the end for her that obtaineth the inheritance A psalm for
David

For her that obtaineth the inheritance  That is for the church of
Christ

52 Give ear O Lord to my words understand my cry

53 Hearken to the voice of my prayer O my King and my God

54 For to thee will I pray O Lord in the morning thou shalt hear my
voice

55 In the morning I will stand before thee and I will see because
thou art not a God that willest iniquity

56 Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee nor shall the unjust
abide before thy eyes

57 Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity thou wilt destroy all
that speak a lie The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor

58 But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into thy
house I will worship towards thy holy temple in thy fear

59 Conduct me O Lord in thy justice because of my enemies direct
my way in thy sight

510 For there is no truth in their mouth their heart is vain

511 Their throat is an open sepulchre they dealt deceitfully with
their tongues judge them O God Let them fall from their devices
according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out for
they have provoked thee O Lord

512 But let all them be glad that hope in thee they shall rejoice
for ever and thou shalt dwell in them And all they that love thy name
shall glory in thee

513 For thou wilt bless the just O Lord thou hast crowned us as
with a shield of thy good will



Psalms Chapter 6


Domine ne in furore

A prayer of a penitent sinner under the scourge of God The first
penitential psalm

61 Unto the end in verses a psalm for David for the octave

For the octave  That is to be sung on an instrument of eight
strings St Augustine understands it mystically of the last
resurrection and the world to come which is as it were the octave
or eighth day after the seven days of this mortal life and for this
octave sinners must dispose themselves like David by bewailing their
sins whilst they are here upon earth

62 O Lord rebuke me not in thy indignation nor chastise me in thy
wrath

63 Have mercy on me O Lord for I am weak heal me O Lord for my
bones are troubled

64 And my soul is troubled exceedingly but thou O Lord how long

65 Turn to me O Lord and deliver my soul O save me for thy mercys
sake

66 For there is no one in death that is mindful of thee and who
shall confess to thee in hell

67 I have laboured in my groanings every night I will wash my bed I
will water my couch with my tears

68 My eye is troubled through indignation I have grown old amongst
all my enemies

69 Depart from em all ye workers of iniquity for the Lord hath
heard the voice of my weeping

610 The Lord hath heard my supplication the Lord hath received my
prayer

611 Let all my enemies be ashamed and be very much troubled let
them be turned back and be ashamed very speedily



Psalms Chapter 7


Domine Deus meus

David trusting in the justice of his cause prayeth for Gods help
against his enemies

71 The psalm of David which he sung to the Lord for the words of
Chusi the son of Jemini

72 O Lord my God in thee have I put my trust same me from all them
that persecute me and deliver me

73 Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion while there is
no one to redeem me nor to save

74 O Lord my God if I have done this thing if there be iniquity in
my hands

75 If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils let me deservedly
fall empty before my enemies

76 Let the enemy pursue my soul and take it and tread down my life
on the earth and bring down my glory to the dust

77 Rise up O Lord in thy anger and be thou exalted in the borders
of my enemies And arise O Lord my God in the precept which thou
hast commanded

78 And a congregation of people shall surround thee And for their
sakes return thou on high

79 The Lord judgeth the people Judge me O Lord according to my
justice and according to my innocence in me

710 The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought and thou
shalt direct the just the searcher of hearts and reins is God Just

711 Is my help from the Lord who saveth the upright of heart

712 God is a just judge strong and patient is he angry every day

713 Except you will be converted he will brandish his sword he hath
bent his bow and made it ready

714 And in it he hath prepared to instruments of death he hath made
ready his arrows for them that burn

For them that burn  That is against the persecutors of his saints

715 Behold he hath been in labour with injustice he hath conceived
sorrow and brought forth iniquity

716 He hath opened a pit and dug it and he is fallen into the hole
he made

717 His sorrow shall be turned on his own head and his iniquity
shall come down upon his crown

718 I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice and will
sing to the name of the Lord the most high



Psalms Chapter 8


Domine Dominus noster

God is wonderful in his works especially in mankind singularly
exalted by the incarnation of Christ

81 Unto the end for the presses a psalm for David

The presses  In Hebrew Gittith supposed to be a musical instrument

82 O Lord our Lord how admirable is thy name in the whole earth
For thy magnificence is elevated above the heavens

83 Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected
praise because of thy enemies that thou mayst destroy the enemy and
the avenger

84 For I will behold thy heavens the works of thy fingers the moon
and the stars which thou hast founded

85 What is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that
thou visitest him

86 Thou hast made him a little less than the angels thou hast
crowned him with glory and honour

87 And hast set him over the works of thy hands

88 Thou hast subjected all things under his feet all sheep and oxen
moreover the beasts also of the fields

89 The birds of the air and the fishes of the sea that pass through
the paths of the sea

810 O Lord our Lord how admirable is thy name in the whole earth



Psalms Chapter 9


Confitebor tibi Domine The church praiseth God for his protection
against her enemies

91 Unto the end for the hidden things of the Son A psalm for David

The hidden things of the Son  The humility and sufferings of Christ
the Son of God and of good Christians who are his sons by adoption
are called hidden things with regard to the children of this world
who know not the value and merit of them

92 I will give praise to thee O Lord with my whole heart I will
relate all thy wonders

93 I will be glad and rejoice in thee I will sing to thy name O
thou most high

94 When my enemy shall be turned back they shall be weakened and
perish before thy face

95 For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause thou hast sat
on the throne who judgest justice

96 Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles and the wicked one hath perished
thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever

97 The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end and their cities
thou hast destroyed Their memory hath perished with a noise

98 But the Lord remaineth for ever He hath prepared his throne in
judgment

99 And he shall judge the world in equity he shall judge the people
in justice

910 And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor a helper in due
time in tribulation

911 And let them trust in thee who know thy name for thou hast not
forsaken them that seek thee O Lord

912 Sing ye to the Lord who dwelleth in Sion declare his ways among
the Gentiles

913 For requiring their blood he hath remembered them he hath not
forgotten the cry of the poor

914 Have mercy on me O Lord see my humiliation which I suffer from
my enemies

915 Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death that I may
declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion

916 I will rejoice in thy salvation the Gentiles have stuck fast in
the destruction which they prepared Their foot hath been taken in the
very snare which they hid

917 The Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments the sinner
hath been caught in the works of his own hands

918 The wicked shall be turned into hell all the nations that forget
God

919 For the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end the patience
of the poor shall not perish for ever

920 Arise O Lord let not man be strengthened let the Gentiles be
judged in thy sight

921 Appoint O Lord a lawgiver over them that the Gentiles may know
themselves to be but men

Here the late Hebrew doctors divide this psalm into two making ver 22
the beginning of Psalm 10 And again they join Psalms 146 and 147 into
one in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed 150
And in this manner the psalms are numbered in the Protestant Bible

Psalm 10 according to the Hebrews

9a1 Why O Lord hast thou retired afar off why dost thou slight us
in our wants in the time of trouble

9a2 Whilst the wicked man is proud the poor is set on fire they are
caught in the counsels which they devise

9a3 For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul and the
unjust man is blessed

9a4 The sinner hath provoked the Lord according to the multitude of
his wrath he will not seek him

9a5 God is not before his eyes his ways are filthy at all times Thy
judgments are removed form his sight he shall rule over all his
enemies

9a6 For he hath said in his heart I shall not be moved from
generation to generation and shall be without evil

9a7 His mouth is full of cursing and of bitterness and of deceit
under his tongue are labour and sorrow

9a8 He sitteth in ambush with the rich in private places that he may
kill the innocent

9a9 His eyes are upon the poor man he lieth in wait in secret like
a lion in his den He lieth in ambush that he may catch the poor man
so catch the poor whilst he draweth him to him

9a10 In his net he will bring him down he will crouch and fall when
he shall have power over the poor

9a11 For he hath said in his heart God hath forgotten he hath turned
away his face not to see to the end

9a12 Arise O Lord God let thy hand be exalted forget not the poor

9a13 Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God for he hath said in his
heart He will not require it

9a14 Thou seest it for thou considerest labour and sorrow that thou
mayst deliver them into thy hands To thee is the poor man left thou
wilt be a helper to the orphan

9a15 Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant his sin
shall be sought and shall not be found

9a16 The Lord shall reign to eternity yea for ever and ever ye
Gentiles shall perish from his land

9a17 The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor thy ear hath heard
the preparation of their heart

9a18 To judge for the fatherless and for the humble that man may no
more presume to magnify himself upon earth



Psalms Chapter 10


In Domino confido

The just mans confidence in God in the midst of persecutions

101 Unto the end A psalm to David

102 In the Lord I put my trust how then do you say to my soul Get
thee away from hence to the mountain like a sparrow

103 For lo the wicked have bent their bow they have prepared their
arrows in the quiver to shoot in the dark the upright of heart

104 For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made but what
has the just man done

105 The Lord is in his holy temple the Lords throne is in heaven
His eyes look on the poor man his eyelids examine the sons of men

106 The Lord trieth the just and the wicked but he that loveth
iniquity hateth his own soul

107 He shall rain snares upon sinners fire and brimstone and storms
of winds shall be the portion of their cup

108 For the Lord is just and hath loved justice his countenance
hath beheld righteousness



Psalms Chapter 11


Salvum me fac

The prophet calls for Gods help against the wicked

111 Unto the end for the octave a psalm for David

112 Save me O Lord for there is now no saint truths are decayed
from among the children of men

113 They have spoken vain things every one to his neighbour with
deceitful lips and with a double heart have they spoken

114 May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips and the tongue that
speaketh proud things

115 Who have said We will magnify our tongue our lips are our own
who is Lord over us

116 By reason of the misery of the needy and the groans of the poor
now will I arise saith the Lord I will set him in safety I will deal
confidently in his regard

117 The words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried by the
fire purged from the earth refined seven times

118 Thou O Lord wilt preserve us and keep us from this generation
for ever

119 The wicked walk round about according to thy highness thou hast
multiplied the children of men



Psalms Chapter 12


Usquequo Domine

A prayer in tribulation

121 Unto the end a psalm for David How long O Lord wilt thou
forget me unto the end how long dost thou turn away thy face from me

122 How long shall I take counsels in my soul sorrow in my heart all
the day

123 How long shall my enemy be exalted over Me

124 Consider and hear me O Lord my God Enlighten my eyes that I
never sleep in death

125 Lest at any time my enemy say I have prevailed against him They
that trouble me will rejoice when I am moved

126 But I have trusted in thy mercy My heart shall rejoice in thy
salvation I will sing to the Lord who giveth me good things yea I
will sing to the name of the Lord the most high



Psalms Chapter 13


Dixit insipiens

The general corruption of man before our redemption by Christ

131 Unto the end a psalm for David The fool hath said in his heart
There is no God They are corrupt and are become abominable in their
ways there is none that doth good no not one

132 The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men
to see if there be any that understand and seek God

133 They are all gone aside they are become unprofitable together
there is none that doth good no not one Their throat is an open
sepulchre with their tongues they acted deceitfully the poison of
asps is under their lips Their mouth is full of cursing and
bitterness their feet are swift to shed blood Destruction and
unhappiness in their ways and the way of peace they have not known
there is no fear of God before their eyes

134 Shall not all they know that work iniquity who devour my people
as they eat bread

135 They have not called upon the Lord there have they trembled for
fear where there was no fear

136 For the Lord is in the just generation you have confounded the
counsel of the poor man but the Lord is his hope

137 Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel when the Lord
shall have turned away the captivity of his people Jacob shall
rejoice and Israel shall be glad



Psalms Chapter 14


Domine quis habitabit

What kind of men shall dwell in the heavenly Sion

141 A psalm for David Lord who shall dwell in thy tabernacle or
who shall rest in thy holy hill

142 He that walketh without blemish and worketh justice

143 He that speaketh truth in his heart who hath not used deceit in
his tongue Nor hath done evil to his neighbour nor taken up a
reproach against his neighbours

144 In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing but he
glorifieth them that fear the Lord He that sweareth to his neighbour
and deceiveth not

145 He that hath not put out his money to usury nortaken bribes
against the innocent He that doth these things shall not be moved for
ever



Psalms Chapter 15


Conserva me Domine

Christs future victory and triumph over the world and death

151 The inscription of a title to David himself Preserve me O Lord
for I have put my trust in thee

The inscription of a title  That is of a pillar or monument
staylographia which is as much as to say that this psalm is most
worthy to be engraved on an everlasting monument

152 I have said to the Lord thou art my God for thou hast no need
of my goods

153 To the saints who are in his land he hath made wonderful all my
desires in them

154 Their infirmities were multiplied afterwards they made haste I
will not gather together their meetings for bloodofferings nor will I
be mindful of their names by my lips

155 The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup it is
thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me

156 The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places for my inheritance
is goodly to me

157 I will bless the Lord who hath given me understanding moreover
my reins also have corrected me even till night

158 I set the Lord always in my sight for he is at my right hand
that I be not moved

159 Therefore my heart hath been glad and my tongue hath rejoiced
moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope

1510 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell nor wilt thou give
thy holy one to see corruption

1511 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt fill me
with joy with thy countenance at thy right hand are delights even to
the end



Psalms Chapter 16


Exaudi Domine justitiam

A just mans prayer in tribulation against the malice of his enemy

161 The prayer of David Hear O Lord my justice attend to my
supplication Give ear unto my prayer which proceedeth not from
deceitful lips

162 Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance let thy eyes
behold the things that are equitable

163 Thou hast proved my heart and visited it by night thou hast
tried me by fire and iniquity hath not been found in me

164 That my mouth may not speak the works of men for the sake of the
words of thy lips I have kept hard ways

165 Perfect thou my goings in thy paths that my footsteps be not
moved

166 I have cried to thee for thou O God hast heard me O incline
thy ear unto me and hear my words

167 Shew forth thy wonderful mercies thou who savest them that trust
in thee

168 From them that resist thy right hand keep me as the apple of thy
eye Protect me under the shadow of thy wings

169 From the face of the wicked who have afflicted me My enemies
have surrounded my soul

1610 They have shut up their fat their mouth hath spoken proudly

Their fat  That is their bowels of compassion for they have none
for me

1611 They have cast me forth and now they have surrounded me they
have set their eyes bowing down to the earth

1612 They have taken me as a lion prepared for the prey and as a
young lion dwelling in secret places

1613 Arise O Lord disappoint him and supplant him deliver my soul
from the wicked one thy sword

1614 From the enemies of thy hand O Lord divide them from the few
of the earth in their life their belly is filled from thy hidden
stores They are full of children and they have left to their little
ones the rest of their substance

Divide them from the few etc  That is cut them off from the earth
and the few trifling things thereof which they are so proud of or
divide them from the few that is from thy elect who are but few
that they may no longer have it in their power to oppress them It is
not meant by way of a curse or imprecation but as many other the like
passages in the psalms by way of a prediction or prophecy of what
should come upon them in punishment of their wickedness Ibid Thy
hidden stores  Thy secret treasures out of which thou furnishest
those earthly goods which with a bountiful hand thou hast distributed
both to the good and the bad

1615 But as for me I will appear before thy sight in justice I
shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear



Psalms Chapter 17


Diligam te Domine

Davids thanks to God for his delivery from all his enemies

171 Unto the end for David the servant of the Lord who spoke to
the Lord the words of this canticle in the day that the Lord delivered
him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul and he
said

172 I will love thee O Lord my strength

173 The Lord is my firmament my refuge and my deliverer My God is
my helper and in him will I put my trust My protector and the horn
of my salvation and my support

174 Praising I will call upon the Lord and I shall be saved from my
enemies

175 The sorrows of death surrounded me and the torrents of iniquity
troubled me

176 The sorrows of hell encompassed me and the snares of death
prevented me

177 In my affliction I called upon the Lord and I cried to my God
And he heard my voice from his holy temple and my cry before him came
into his ears

178 The earth shook and trembled the foundations of the mountains
were troubled and were moved because he was angry with them

179 There went up a smoke in his wrath and a fire flamed from his
face coals were kindled by it

1710 He bowed the heavens and came down and darkness was under his
feet

1711 And he ascended upon the cherubim and he flew he flew upon the
wings of the winds

1712 And he made darkness his covert his pavilion round about him
dark waters in the clouds of the air

1713 At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed hail
and coals of fire

1714 And the Lord thundered from heaven and the Highest gave his
voice hail and coals of fire

1715 And he sent forth his arrows and he scattered them he
multiplied lightnings and troubled them

1716 Then the fountains of waters appeared and the foundations of
the world were discovered At thy rebuke O Lord at the blast of the
spirit of thy wrath

1717 He sent from on high and took me and received me out of many
waters

1718 He delivered me from my strongest enemies and from them that
hated me for they were too strong for me

1719 They prevented me in the day of my affliction and the Lord
became my protector

1720 And he brought me forth into a large place he saved me because
he was well pleased with me

1721 And the Lord will reward me according to my justice and will
repay me according to the cleanness of my hands

1722 Because I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not done
wickedly against my God

1723 For all his judgments are in my sight and his justices I have
not put away from me

1724 And I shall be spotless with him and shall keep myself from my
iniquity

1725 And the Lord will reward me according to my justice and
according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes

1726 With the holy thou wilt be holy and with the innocent man thou
wilt be innocent

1727 And withe the elect thou wilt be elect and with the perverse
thou wilt be perverted

1728 For thou wilt save the humble people but wilt bring down the
eyes of the proud

1729 For thou lightest my lamp O Lord O my God enlighten my
darkness

1730 For by thee I shall be delivered from temptation and through my
God I shall go over a wall

1731 As for my God his way is undefiled the words of the Lord are
firetried he is the protector of all that trust in him

1732 For who is God but the Lord or who is God but our God

1733 God who hath girt me with strength and made my way blameless

1734 Who hath made my feet like the feet of harts and who setteth me
upon high places

1735 Who teacheth my hands to war and thou hast made my arms like a
brazen bow

1736 And thou hast given me the protection of thy salvation and thy
right hand hath held me up And thy discipline hath corrected me unto
the end and thy discipline the same shall teach me

1737 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me and my feet are not
weakened

1738 I will pursue after my enemies and overtake them and I will
not turn again till they are consumed

1739 I will break them and they shall not be able to stand they
shall fall under my feet

1740 And thou hast girded me with strength unto battle and hast
subdued under me them that rose up against me

1741 And thou hast made my enemies furn their back upon me and hast
destroyed them that hated me

1742 They cried but there was none to save them to the Lord but he
heard them not

1743 And I shall beat them as small as the dust before the wind I
shall bring them to nought like the dirt in the streets

1744 Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people thou
wilt make me head of the Gentiles

1745 A people which I knew not hath served me at the hearing of the
ear they have obeyed me

1746 The children that are strangers have lied to me strange
children have faded away and have halted from their paths

1747 The Lord liveth and blessed by my God and let the God of my
salvation be exalted

1748 O God who avengest me and subduest the people under me my
deliverer from my enraged enemies

1749 And thou wilt lift me up above them that rise up against me
from the unjust man thou wilt deliver me

1750 Therefore will I give glory to thee O Lord among the nations
and I will sing a psalm to thy name

1751 Giving great deliverance to his king and shewing mercy to
David his anointed and to his seed for ever

Coeli enarrant

The works of God shew forth his glory his law is greatly to be
esteemed and loved

181 Unto the end A Psalm for David

182 The heavens shew forth the glory of God and the firmament
declareth the work of his hands

183 Day to day uttereth speech and night to night sheweth knowledge

184 There are no speeches nor languages where their voices are not
heard

185 Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth and their words
unto the ends of the world

186 He hath set his tabernacle in the sun and he as a bridegroom
coming out of his bridechamber Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the
way

187 His going out is from the end of heaven And his circuit even to
the end thereof and there is no one that can hide himself from his
heat

188 The law of the Lord is unspotted converting souls the testimony
of the Lord is faithful giving wisdom to little ones

189 The justices of the Lord are right rejoicing hearts the
commandment of the Lord is lightsome enlightening the eyes

1810 The fear of the Lord is holy enduring for ever and ever the
judgments of the Lord are true justified in themselves

1811 More to be desired than gold and many precious stones and
sweeter than honey and the honeycomb

1812 For thy servant keepeth them and in keeping them there is a
great reward

1813 Who can understand sins from my secret ones cleanse me O Lord

1814 And from those of others spare thy servant If they shall have
no dominion over me then shall I be without spot and I shall be
cleansed form the greatest sin

1815 And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please and the
meditation of my heart always in thy sight O Lord my helper and my
Redeemer

Exaudiat te Dominus

A prayer for the king

191 Unto the end A psalm for David

192 May the Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation may the name of
the God of Jacob protect thee

burntoffering be made fat

salvation of his right hand is in powers

The salvation of his right hand is in powers  That is in strength
His right hand is strong and mighty to save them that trust in him

198 Some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will call upon

upright O Lord save the king and hear us in the day that we shall
call upon thee

Domine in virtute

Praise to God for Christs exaltation after his passion

201 Unto the end A psalm for David

202 In thy strength O Lord the king shall joy and in thy salvation
he shall rejoice exceedingly

203 Thou hast given him his hearts desire and hast not withholden
from him the will of his lips

204 For thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness thou
hast set on his head a crown of precious stones

205 He asked life of thee and thou hast given him length of days for
ever and ever

206 His glory is great in thy salvation glory and great beauty shalt
thou lay upon him

207 For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever thou
shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance

208 For the king hopeth in the Lord and through the mercy of the
most High he shall not be moved

209 Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies let thy right hand find
out all them that hate thee

2010 Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire in the time of thy
anger the Lord shall trouble them in his wrath and fire shall devour
them

2011 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed
from among the children of men

2012 For they have intended evils against thee they have devised
counsels which they have not been able to establish

2013 For thou shalt make them turn their back in thy remnants thou
shalt prepare their face

In thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face  Or thou shalt set thy
remnants against their faces That is thou shalt make them see what
punishments remain for them hereafter from thy justice Instead of
remnants St Jerome renders it funes that is cords or strings viz
of the bow of divine justice from which God directs his arrows against
the faces of his enemies

2014 Be thou exalted O Lord in thy own strength we will sing and
praise thy power

Deus Deus meus

Christs passion and the conversion of the Gentiles

211 Unto the end for the morning protection a psalm for David

212 O God my God look upon me why hast thou forsaken me Far from
my salvation are the words of my sins

The words of my sins  That is the sins of the world which I have
taken upon myself cry out against me and are the cause of all my
sufferings

213 O my God I shall cry by day and thou wilt not hear and by
night and it shall not be reputed as folly in me

214 But thou dwellest in the holy place the praise of Israel

215 In thee have our fathers hoped they have hoped and thou hast
delivered them

216 They cried to thee and they were saved they trusted in thee
and were not confounded

217 But I am a worm and no man the reproach of men and the outcast
of the people

218 All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn they have spoken
with the lips and wagged the head

219 He hoped in the Lord let him deliver him let him save him
seeing he delighteth in him

2110 For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb my hope from
the breasts of my mother

2111 I was cast upon thee from the womb From my mothers womb thou
art my God

2112 Depart not from me For tribulation is very near for there is
none to help me

2113 Many calves have surrounded me fat bulls have besieged me

2114They have opened their mouths against me as a lion ravening and
roaring

2115 I am poured out like water and all my bones are scattered My
heart is become like wax melting in the midst of my bowels

2116 My strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue hath
cleaved to my jaws and thou hast brought me down into the dust of
death

2117 For many dogs have encompassed me the council of the malignant
hath besieged me They have dug my hands and feet

2118 They have numbered all my bones And they have looked and stared
upon me

2119 They parted my garments amongst them and upon my vesture they
cast lots

2120 But thou O Lord remove not thy help to a distance from me
look towards my defence

2121 Deliver O God my soul from the sword my only one from the
hand of the dog

2122 Save me from the lions mouth and my lowness from the horns of
the unicorns

2123 I will declare thy name to my brethren in the midst of the
church will I praise thee

2124 Ye that fear the Lord praise him all ye the seed of Jacob
glorify him

2125 Let all the seed of Israel fear him because he hath not
slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man Neither hath he
turned away his face form me and when I cried to him he heard me

2126 With thee is my praise in a great church I will pay my vows in
the sight of them that fear him

2127 The poor shall eat and shall be filled and they shall praise
the Lord that seek him their hearts shall live for ever and ever

2128 All the ends of the earth shall remember and shall be converted
to the Lord And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in his
sight

2129 For the kingdom is the Lords and he shall have dominion over
the nations

2130 All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored all
they that go down to the earth shall fall before him

2131 And to him my soul shall live and my seed shall serve him

2132 There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come and
the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be
born which the Lord hath made

will fear no evils for thou art with me Thy rod and thy staff they

soul in vain nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour

235 He shall receive a blessing from the Lord and mercy from God his
Saviour

Davids faith and hope in God

261 The psalm of David before he was anointed The Lord is my light
and my salvation whom shall I fear The Lord is the protector of my
life of whom shall I be afraid

262 Whilst the wicked draw near against me to eat my flesh My
enemies that trouble me have themselves been weakened and have
fallen

263 If armies in camp should stand together against me my heart
shall not fear If a battle should rise up against me in this will I
be confident

264 One thing I have asked of the Lord this will I seek after that
I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life That I
may see the delight of the Lord and may visit his temple

265 For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle in the day of evils he
hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle

266 He hath exalted me upon a rock and now he hath lifted up my head
above my enemies I have gone round and have offered up in his
tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation I will sing and recite a psalm
to the Lord

267 Hear O Lord my voice with which I have cried to thee have
mercy on me and hear me

268 My heart hath said to thee My face hath sought thee thy face O
Lord will I still seek

269 Turn not away thy face from me decline not in thy wrath from thy
servant Be thou my helper forsake me not do not thou despise me O
God my Saviour

2610 For my father and my mother have left me but the Lord hath
taken me up

2611 Set me O Lord a law in thy way and guide me in the right
path because of my enemies

2612 Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me for
unjust witnesses have risen up against me and iniquity hath lied to
itself

and wait thou for the Lord

271 A psalm for David himself Unto thee will I cry O Lord O my
God be not thou silent to me lest if thou be silent to me I become

when I lift up my hands to thy holy temple

273 Draw me not away together with the wicked and with the workers
of iniquity destroy me not Who speak peace with their neighbour but
evils are in their hearts

274 Give them according to their works and according to the
wickedness of their inventions According to the works of their hands
give thou to them render to them their reward

operations of his hands thou shalt destroy them and shalt not build
them up

supplication

277 The Lord is my helper and my protector in him hath my heart
confided and I have been helped And my flesh hath flourished again

the Lord O ye children of God bring to the Lord the offspring of
rams

282 Bring to the Lord glory and honour bring to the Lord glory to
his name adore ye the Lord in his holy court

283 The voice of the Lord is upon the waters the God of majesty hath
thundered The Lord is upon many waters

284 The voice of the Lord is in power the voice of the Lord in
magnificence

285 The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars yea the Lord shall
break the cedars of Libanus

286 And shall reduce them to pieces as a calf of Libanus and as the
beloved son of unicorns

Shall reduce them to pieces etc  In Hebrew shall make them to skip
like a calf The psalmist here describes the effects of thunder which
he calls the voice of the Lord which sometimes breaks down the tallest
and strongest trees and makes their broken branches skip etc All
this is to be understood mystically of the powerful voice of Gods word
in his church which has broken the pride of the great ones of this
world and brought many of them meekly and joyfully to submit their
necks to the sweet yoke of Christ

287 The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire

288 The voice of the Lord shaketh the desert and the Lord shall
shake the desert of Cades

289 The voice of the Lord prepareth the stags and he will discover
the thick woods and in his temple all shall speak his glory

for ever The Lord will give strength to his people the Lord will
bless his people with peace

David praiseth God for his deliverance and his merciful dealings with
him

291 A psalm of a canticle at the dedication of Davids house

292 I will extol thee O Lord for thou hast upheld me and hast not
made my enemies to rejoice over me

293 O Lord my God I have cried to thee and thou hast healed me

294 Thou hast brought forth O Lord my soul from hell thou hast
saved me from them that go down into the pit

295 Sing to the Lord O ye his saints and give praise to the memory
of his holiness

296 For wrath is in his indignation and life in his good will In
the evening weeping shall have place and in the morning gladness

297 And in my abundance I said I shall never be moved

298 O Lord in thy favour thou gavest strength to my beauty Thou
turnedst away thy face from me and I became troubled

299 To thee O Lord will I cry and I will make supplication to my
God

2910 What profit is there in my blood whilst I go down to
corruption Shall dust confess to thee or declare thy truth

2911 The Lord hath heard and hath had mercy on me the Lord became
my helper

2912 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy thou hast cut my
sackcloth and hast compassed me with gladness

2913 To the end that my glory may sing to thee and I may not regret
O Lord my God I will give praise to thee for ever



Psalms Chapter 30


In te Domine speravi

A prayer of a just man under affliction

301 Unto the end a psalm for David in an ecstasy

302 In thee O Lord have I hoped let me never be confounded
deliver me in thy justice

303 Bow down thy ear to me make haste to deliver me Be thou unto me
a God a protector and a house of refuge to save me

304 For thou art my strength and my refuge and for thy names sake
thou wilt lead me and nourish me

305 Thou wilt bring me out of this snare which they have hidden for
me for thou art my protector

306 Into thy hands I commend my spirit thou hast redeemed me O
Lord the God of truth

307 Thou hast hated them that regard vanities to no purpose But I
have hoped in the Lord

308 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy For thou hast regarded
my humility thou hast saved my soul out of distresses

309 And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy thou hast
set my feet in a spacious place

3010 Have mercy on me O Lord for I am afflicted my eye is troubled
with wrath my soul and my belly

3011 For my life is wasted with grief and my years in sighs My
strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed

3012 I am become a reproach among all my enemies and very much to my
neighbours and a fear to my acquaintance They that saw me without
fled from me

3013 I am forgotten as one dead from the heart I am become as a
vessel that is destroyed

3014 For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about While
they assembled together against me they consulted to take away my
life

3015 But I have put my trust in thee O Lord I said Thou art my
God

3016 My lots are in thy hands Deliver me out of the hands of my
enemies and from them that persecute me

3017 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me in thy mercy

3018 Let me not be confounded O Lord for I have called upon thee
Let the wicked be ashamed and be brought down to hell

3019 Let deceitful lips be made dumb Which speak iniquity against
the just with pride and abuse

3020 O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness O Lord which
thou hast hidden for them that fear thee Which thou hast wrought for
them that hope in thee in the sight of the sons of men

3021 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face from the
disturbance of men Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle from the
contradiction of tongues

3022 Blessed be the Lord for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me
in a fortified city

3023 But I said in the excess of my mind I am cast away from before
thy eyes Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer when I
cried to thee

3024 O love the Lord all ye his saints for the Lord will require
truth and will repay them abundantly that act proudly

3025 Do ye manfully and let your heart be strengthened all ye that
hope in the Lord



Psalms Chapter 31


Beati quorum

The second penitential psalm

311 To David himself understanding Blessed are they whose
iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered

312 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin and in
whose spirit there is no guile

313 Because I was silent my bones grew old whilst I cried out all
the day long

Because I was silent etc  That is whilst I kept silence by
concealing or refusing to confess my sins thy hand was heavy upon me
etc

314 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me I am turned in my
anguish whilst the thorn is fastened

I am turned etc  That is I turn and roll about in my bed to seek
for ease in my pain whilst the thorn of thy justice pierces my flesh
and sticks fast in me Or I am turned that is I am converted to
thee my God by being brought to a better understanding by thy
chastisements In the Hebrew it is my moisture is turned into the
droughts of the summer

315 I have acknowledged my sin to thee and my injustice I have not
concealed I said I will confess against my self my injustice to the
Lord and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin

316 For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a
seasonable time And yet in a flood of many waters they shall not come
nigh unto him

317 Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me my
joy deliver me from them that surround me

318 I will give thee understanding and I will instruct thee in this
way in which thou shalt go I will fix my eyes upon thee

319 Do not become like the horse and the mule who have no
understanding With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws who come not
near unto thee

3110 Many are the scourges of the sinner but mercy shall encompass
him that hopeth in the Lord

3111 Be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye just and glory all ye
right of heart

becometh the upright

322 Give praise to the Lord on the harp sing to him with the
psaltery the instrument of ten strings

324 For the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done
with faithfulness

325 He loveth mercy and judgment the earth is full of the mercy of
the Lord

326 By the word of the Lord the heavens were established and all the
power of them by the spirit of his mouth

327 Gathering together the waters of the sea as in a vessel laying
up the depths in storehouses

328 Let all the earth fear the Lord and let all the inhabitants of
the world be in awe of him

329 For he spoke and they were made he commanded and they were
created

3210 The Lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations and he
rejecteth the devices of people and casteth away the counsels of
princes

3211 But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever the thoughts of
his heart to all generations

3212 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord the people whom he
hath chosen for his inheritance

3213 The Lord hath looked from heaven he hath beheld all the sons of
men

3214 From his habitation which he hath prepared he hath looked upon
all that dwell on the earth

3215 He who hath made the hearts of every one of them who
understandeth all their works

3216 The king is not saved by a great army nor shall the giant be
saved by his own great strength

3217 Vain is the horse for safety neither shall he be saved by the
abundance of his strength

3218 Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him and on
them that hope in his mercy

3219 To deliver their souls from death and feed them in famine

3220 Our soul waiteth for the Lord for he is our helper and
protector

3221 For in him our heart shall rejoice and in his holy name we have
trusted

3222 Let thy mercy O Lord be upon us as we have hooped in thee



Psalms Chapter 33


Benedicam Dominum

An exhortation to the praise and service of God

331 For David when he changed his countenance before Achimelech who
dismissed him and he went his way 1 Kings 21

332 I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall be always in
my mouth

333 In the Lord shall my soul be praised let the meek hear and
rejoice

334 O magnify the Lord with me and let us extol his name together

335 I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all
my troubles

336 Come ye to him and be enlightened and your faces shall not be
confounded

337 This poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of
all his troubles

338 The angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear
him and shall deliver them

339 O taste and see that the Lord is sweet blessed is the man that
hopeth in him

3310 Fear the Lord all ye his saints for there is no want to them
that fear him

3311 The rich have wanted and have suffered hunger but they that
seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good

3312 Come children hearken to me I will teach you the fear of the
Lord

3316 The eyes of the Lord are upon the just and his ears unto their
prayers

things to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth

3318 The just cried and the Lord heard them and delivered them out
of all their troubles

3319 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart and he
will save the humble of spirit

the Lord deliver them

will save the humble of spirit

just shall be guilty

that trust in him shall offend



Psalms Chapter 34


Judica Domine nocentes me

David in the person of Christ prayeth against his persecutors
prophetically foreshewing the punishments that shall fall upon them

341 For David himself Judge thou O Lord them that wrong me
overthrow them that fight against me

342 Take hold of arms and shield and rise up to help me

343 Bring out the sword and shut up the way against them that
persecute me say to my soul I am thy salvation

344 Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul Let
them be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me

345 Let them become as dust before the wind and let the angel of the
Lord straiten them

346 Let their way become dark and slippery and let the angel of the
Lord pursue them

347 For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto
destruction without cause they have upbraided my soul

348 Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him and let the net
which he hath hidden catch him and into that very snare let them fall

349 But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord and shall be delighted in
his salvation

3410 All my bones shall say Lord who is like to thee Who
deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he
the needy and the poor from them that strip him

3411 Unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not

3412 They repaid me evil for good to the depriving me of my soul

3413 But as for me when they were troublesome to me I was clothed
with haircloth I humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer shall be
turned into my bosom

3414 As a neighbour and as an own brother so did I please as one
mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled

3415 But they rejoiced against me and came together scourges were
gathered together upon me and I knew not

3416 They were separated and repented not they tempted me they
scoffed at me with scorn they gnashed upon me with their teeth

3417 Lord when wilt thou look upon me rescue thou my soul from
their malice my only one from the lions

3418 I will give thanks to thee in a great church I will praise thee
in a strong people

3419 Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me who
have hated me without cause and wink with the eyes

3420 For they spoke indeed peaceably to me and speaking in the anger
of the earth they devised guile

3421 And they opened their mouth wide against me they said Well
done well done our eyes have seen it

3422 Thou hast seen O Lord be not thou silent O Lord depart not
from me

3423 Arise and be attentive to my judgment to my cause my God and
my Lord

3424 Judge me O Lord my God according to thy justice and let them
not rejoice over me

3425 Let them not say in their hearts It is well it is well to our
mind neither let them say We have swallowed him up

3426 Let them blush and be ashamed together who rejoice at my
evils Let them be clothed with confusion and shame who speak great
things against me

3427 Let them rejoice and be glad who are well pleased with my
justice and let them say always The Lord be magnified who delights
in the peace of his servant

3428 And my tongue shall meditate thy justice thy praise all the day
long



Psalms Chapter 35


Dixit injustus

The malice of sinners and the goodness of God

351 Unto the end for the servant of God David himself

352 The unjust hath said within himself that he would sin there is
no fear of God before his eyes

353 For in his sight he hath done deceitfully that his iniquity may
be found unto hatred

Unto hatred  That is hateful to God

354 The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile he would not
understand that he might do well

355 He hath devised iniquity on his bed he hath set himself on every
way that is not good but evil he hath not hated

356 O Lord thy mercy is in heaven and thy truth reacheth even to
the clouds

357 Thy justice is as the mountains of God thy judgments are a great
deep Men and beasts thou wilt preserve O Lord

358 O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy O God But the children of
men shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings

359 They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house and thou
shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure

3510 For with thee is the fountain of life and in thy light we shall
see light

3511 Extend thy mercy to them that know thee and thy justice to them
that are right in heart

3512 Let not the foot of pride come to me and let not the hand of
the sinner move me

3513 There the workers of iniquity are fallen they are cast out and
could not stand



Psalms Chapter 36


Noli aemulari

An exhortation to despise this world and the short prosperity of the
wicked and to trust in Providence

361 Be not emulous of evildoers nor envy them that work iniquity

362 For they shall shortly wither away as grass and as the green
herbs shall quickly fall

363 Trust in the Lord and do good and dwell in the land and thou
shalt be fed with its riches

364 Delight in the Lord and he will give thee the requests of thy
heart

365 Commit thy way to the Lord and trust in him and he will do it

366 And he will bring forth thy justice as the light and thy
judgment as the noonday

367 Be subject to the Lord and pray to him Envy not the man who
prospereth in his way the man who doth unjust things

368 Cease from anger and leave rage have no emulation to do evil

369 For evildoers shall be cut off but they that wait upon the Lord
they shall inherit the land

3610 For yet a little while and the wicked shall not be and thou
shalt seek his place and shalt not find it

3611 But the meek shall inherit the land and shall delight in
abundance of peace

3612 The sinner shall watch the just man and shall gnash upon him
with his teeth

3613 But the Lord shall laugh at him for he foreseeth that his day
shall come

3614 The wicked have drawn out the sword they have bent their bow
To cast down the poor and needy to kill the upright of heart

3615 Let their sword enter into their own hearts and let their bow
be broken

3616 Better is a little to the just than the great riches of the
wicked

3617 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces but the
Lord strengtheneth the just

3618 The Lord knoweth the days of the undefiled and their
inheritance shall be for ever

3619 They shall not be confounded in the evil time and in the days
of famine they shall be filled

3620 Because the wicked shall perish And the enemies of the Lord
presently after they shall be honoured and exalted shall come to
nothing and vanish like smoke

3621 The sinner shall borrow and not pay again but the just sheweth
mercy and shall give

3622 For such as bless him shall inherit the land but such as curse
him shall perish

3623 With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed and he shall
like well his way

3624 When he shall fall he shall not be bruised for the Lord putteth
his hand under him

3625 I have been young and now am old and I have not seen the just
forsaken nor his seed seeking bread

3626 He sheweth mercy and lendeth all the day long and his seed
shall be in blessing

3627 Decline from evil and do good and dwell for ever and ever

3628 For the Lord loveth judgment and will not forsake his saints
they shall be preserved for ever The unjust shall be punished and the
seed of the wicked shall perish

3629 But the just shall inherit the land and shall dwell therein for
evermore

3630 The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom and his tongue
shall speak judgment

3631 The law of his God is in his heart and his steps shall not be
supplanted

3632 The wicked watcheth the just man and seeketh to put him to
death

3633 But the Lord will not leave him in his hands nor condemn him
when he shall be judged

3634 Expect the Lord and keep his way and he will exalt thee to
inherit the land when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see

3635 I have seen the wicked highly exalted and lifted up like the
cedars of Libanus

3636 And I passed by and lo he was not and I sought him and his
place was not found

3637 Keep innocence and behold justice for there are remnants for
the peaceable man

3638 But the unjust shall be destroyed together the remnants of the
wicked shall perish

3639 But the salvation of the just is from the Lord and he is their
protector in the time of trouble

3640 And the Lord will help them and deliver them and he will rescue
them from the wicked and save them because they have hoped in him



Psalms Chapter 37


Domine ne in furore

A prayer of a penitent for the remission of his sins The third
penitential psalm

371 A psalm for David for a remembrance of the sabbath

For a remembrance  Viz of our miseries and sins and to be sung on
the sabbath day

372 Rebuke me not O Lord in thy indignation nor chastise me in thy
wrath

373 For thy arrows are fastened in me and thy hand hath been strong
upon me

374 There is no health in my flesh because of thy wrath there is no
peace for my bones because of my sins

375 For my iniquities are gone over my head and as a heavy burden
are become heavy upon me

376 My sores are putrified and corrupted because of my foolishness

377 I am become miserable and am bowed down even to the end I
walked sorrowful all the day long

378 For my loins are filled with illusions and there is no health in
my flesh

379 I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly I roared with the
groaning of my heart

3710 Lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not
hidden from thee

3711 My heart is troubled my strength hath left me and the light of
my eyes itself is not with me

3712 My friends and my neighbours have drawn near and stood against
me And they that were near me stood afar off

3713 And they that sought my soul used violence And they that sought
evils to me spoke vain things and studied deceits all the day long

3714 But I as a deaf man heard not and as a dumb man not opening
his mouth

3715 And I became as a man that heareth not and that hath no
reproofs in his mouth

3716 For in thee O Lord have I hoped thou wilt hear me O Lord my
God

3717 For I said Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me and
whilst my feet are moved they speak great things against me

3718 For I am ready for scourges and my sorrow is continually before
me

3719 For I will declare my iniquity and I will think for my sin

3720 But my enemies live and are stronger than I and they that hate
me wrongfully are multiplied

3721 They that render evil for good have detracted me because I
followed goodness

3722 For sake me not O Lord my God do not thou depart from me

3723 Attend unto my help O Lord the God of my salvation



Psalms Chapter 38


Dixi custodiam

A just mans peace and patience in his sufferings considering the
vanity of the world and the providence of God

381 Unto the end for Idithun himself a canticle of David

382 I said I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my
tongue I have set a guard to my mouth when the sinner stood against
me

383 I was dumb and was humbled and kept silence from good things
and my sorrow was renewed

384 My heart grew hot within me and in my meditation a fire shall
flame out

385 I spoke with my tongue O Lord make me know my end And what is
the number of my days that I may know what is wanting to me

386 Behold thou hast made my days measurable and my substance is as
nothing before thee And indeed all things are vanity every man
living

387 Surely man passeth as an image yea and he is disquieted in
vain He storeth up and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these
things

388 And now what is my hope is it not the Lord and my substance is
with thee

389 Deliver thou me from all my iniquities thou hast made me a
reproach to the fool

3810 I was dumb and I opened not my mouth because thou hast done
it

3811 Remove thy scourges from me The strength of thy hand hath made
me faint in rebukes

3812 Thou hast corrected man for iniquity And thou hast made his
soul to waste away like a spider surely in vain is any man disquieted

3813 Hear my prayer O Lord and my supplication give ear to my
tears Be no silent for I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as
all my fathers were

3814 O forgive me that I may be refreshed before I go hence and be
no more



Psalms Chapter 39


Expectans expectavi

Christs coming and redeeming mankind

391 Unto the end a psalm for David himself

392 With expectation I have waited for the Lord and he was attentive
to me

393 And he heard my prayers and brought me out of the pit of misery
and the mire of dregs And he set my feet upon a rock and directed my
steps

394 And he put a new canticle into my mouth a song to our God Many
shall see and shall fear and they shall hope in the Lord

395 Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord and
who hath not had regard to vanities and lying follies

396 Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works O Lord my God and in
thy thoughts there is no one like to thee I have declared and I have
spoken they are multiplied above number

397 Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire but thou hast
pierced ears for me Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not
require

398 Then said I Behold I come In the head of the book it is written
of me

399 That I should do thy will O my God I have desired it and thy
law in the midst of my heart

3910 I have declared thy justice in a great church lo I will not
restrain my lips O Lord thou knowest it

3911 I have not hid thy justice within my heart I have declared thy
truth and thy salvation I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth
from a great council

3912 Withhold not thou O Lord thy tender mercies from me thy mercy
and thy truth have always upheld me

3913 For evils without number have surrounded me my iniquities have
overtaken me and I was not able to see They are multiplied above the
hairs of my head and my heart hath forsaken me

My iniquities  That is the sins of all mankind which I have taken
upon me

3914 Be pleased O Lord to deliver me look down O Lord to help
me

3915 Let them be confounded and ashamed together that seek after my
soul to take it away Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that
desire evils to me

3916 Let them immediately bear their confusion that say to me T is
well t is well

T is well  The Hebrew here is an interjection of insult and
derision like the Vah Matt 2749

3917 Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such
as love thy salvation say always The Lord be magnified

3918 But I am a beggar and poor the Lord is careful for me Thou art
my helper and my protector O my God be not slack



Psalms Chapter 40


Beatus qui intelligit

The happiness of him that shall believe in Christ notwithstanding the
humility and poverty in which he shall come the malice of his enemies
especially of the traitor Judas

401 Unto the end a psalm for David himself

402 Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the
poor the Lord will deliver him in the evil day

403 The Lord preserve him and give him life and make him blessed
upon the earth and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies

404 The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow thou hast turned all his
couch in his sickness

405 I said O Lord be thou merciful to me heal my soul for I have
sinned against thee

406 My enemies have spoken evils against me when shall he die and
his name perish

407 And if he came in to see me he spoke vain things his heart
gathered together iniquity to itself He went out and spoke to the same
purpose

408 All my enemies whispered together against me they devised evils
to me

409 They determined against me an unjust word shall he that sleepeth
rise again no more

4010 For even the man of my peace in whom I trusted who ate my
bread hath greatly supplanted me

4011 But thou O Lord have mercy on me and raise my up again and I
will requite them

4012 By this I know that thou hast had a good will for me because
my enemy shall not rejoice over me

4013 But thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence and hast
established me in thy sight for ever

4014 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity
So be it So be it



Psalms Chapter 41


Quemadmodum desiderat

The fervent desire of the just after God hope in afflictions

411 Unto the end understanding for the sons of Core

412 As the hart panteth after the fountains of water so my soul
panteth after thee O God

413 My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God when shall I
come and appear before the face of God

414 My tears have been my bread day and night whilst it is said to
me daily Where is thy God

415 These things I remembered and poured out my soul in me for I
shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle even to the
house of God With the voice of joy and praise the noise of one
feasting

416 Why art thou sad O my soul and why dost thou trouble me Hope
in God for I will still give praise to him the salvation of my
countenance

417 And my God My soul is troubled within my self therefore will I
remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim from the little
hill

418 Deep calleth on deep at the noise of thy floodgates All thy
heights and thy billows have passed over me

419 In the daytime the Lord hath commanded his mercy and a canticle
to him in the night With me is prayer to the God of my life

4110 I will say to God Thou art my support Why hast thou forgotten
me and why go I mourning whilst my enemy afflicteth me

4111 Whilst my bones are broken my enemies who trouble me have
reproached me Whilst they say to me day by day Where is thy God

4112 Why art thou cast down O my soul and why dost thou disquiet
me Hope thou in God for I will still give praise to him the
salvation of my countenance and my God



Psalms Chapter 42


Judica me Deus

The prophet aspireth after the temple and altar of God

421 A psalm for David Judge me O God and distinguish my cause from
the nation that is not holy deliver me from the unjust and deceitful
man

422 For thou art God my strength why hast thou cast me off and why
do I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me

423 Sent forth thy light and thy truth they have conducted me and
brought me unto thy holy hill and into thy tabernacles

424 And I will go in to the altar of God to God who giveth joy to my
youth

425 To thee O God my God I will give praise upon the harp why art
thou sad O my soul and why dost thou disquiet me

426 Hope in God for I will still give praise to him the salvation
of my countenance and my God



Psalms Chapter 43


Deus auribus nostris

The church commemorates former favours and present afflictions under
which she prays for succour

431 Unto the end for the sons of Core to give understanding

432 We have heard O God with our ears our fathers have declared to
us The work thou hast wrought in their days and in the days of old

433 Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles and thou plantedst them thou
didst afflict the people and cast them out

434 For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword
neither did their own arm save them But thy right hand and thy arm
and the light of thy countenance because thou wast pleased with them

435 Thou art thyself my king and my God who commandest the saving of
Jacob

436 Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn and
through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us

437 For I will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me

438 But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us and hast put
them to shame that hate us

439 In God shall we glory all the day long and in thy name we will
give praise for ever

4310 But now thou hast cast us off and put us to shame and thou  O
God wilt not go out with our armies

4311 Thou hast made us turn our back to our enemies and they that
hated us plundered for themselves

4312 Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten thou hast
scattered us among the nations

4313 Thou hast sold thy people for no price and there was no
reckoning in the exchange of them

4314 Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours a scoff and
derision to them that are round about us

4315 Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles a shaking of the
head among the people

4316 All the day long my shame is before me and the confusion of my
face hath covered me

4317 At the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me at the
face of the enemy and persecutor

4318 All these things have come upon us yet we have not forgotten
thee and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant

4319 And our heart hath not turned back neither hast thou turned
aside our steps from thy way

4320 For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction and the
shadow of death hath covered us

4321 If we have forgotten the name of our God and if we have spread
forth our hands to a strange god

4322 Shall not God search out these things for he knoweth the
secrets of the heart Because for thy sake we are killed all the day
long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter

4323 Arise why sleepest thou O Lord arise and cast us not off to
the end

4324 Why turnest thou thy face away and forgettest our want and our
trouble

4325 For our soul is humbled down to the dust our belly cleaveth to
the earth

4326 Arise O Lord help us and redeem us for thy names sake

Magnus Dominus

God is greatly to be praised for the establishment of his church

471 A psalm of a canticle for the sons of Core on the second day of
the week

472 Great is the Lord and exceedingly to be praised in the city of
our God in his holy mountain

473 With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded on the
sides of the north the city of the great king

474 In her houses shall God be known when he shall protect her

475 For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves they
gathered together

476 So they saw and they wondered they were troubled they were
moved

477 Trembling took hold of them There were pains as of a woman in
labour

478 With a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of
Tharsis

479 As we have heard so have we seen in the city of the Lord of
hosts in the city of our God God hath founded it for ever

4710 We have received thy mercy O God in the midst of thy temple

4711 According to thy name O God so also is thy praise unto the
ends of the earth thy right hand is full of justice

4712 Let mount Sion rejoice and the daughters of Juda be glad
because of thy judgments O Lord

4713 Surround Sion and encompass her tell lye in her towers

4714 Set your hearts on her strength and distribute her houses that
ye may relate it in another generation

4715 For this is God our God unto eternity and for ever and ever
he shall rule us for evermore



Psalms Chapter 48


Audite haec omnes gentes

The folly of worldlings who live on in sin without thinking of death
or hell

481 Unto the end a psalm for the sons of Core

482 Hear these things all ye nations give ear all ye inhabitants
of the world

483 All you that are earthborn and you sons of men both rich and
poor together

484 My mouth shall speak wisdom and the meditation of my heart
understanding

485 I will incline my ear to a parable I will open my proposition on
the psaltery

486 Why shall I fear in the evil day the iniquity of my heel shall
encompass me

The iniquity of my heel  That is the iniquity of my steps or ways
or the iniquity of my pride with which as with the heel I have
spurned and kicked at my neighbours or the iniquity of my heel that
is the iniquity in which I shall be found in death The meaning of
this verse is Why should I now indulge those passions and sinful
affections or commit now those sins which will cause me so much fear
and anguish in the evil day when the sorrows of death shall compass
me and the perils of hell shall find me

487 They that trust in their own strength and glory in the multitude
of their riches

They that trust etc  As much as to say let them fear that trust in
their strength or riches for they have great reason to fear seeing no
brother or other man how much a friend soever can by any price or
labour rescue them from death

488 No brother can redeem nor shall man redeem he shall not give to
God his ransom

489 Nor the price of the redemption of his soul and shall labour for
ever

And shall labour for ever etc  This seems to be a continuation of
the foregoing sentence as much as to say no man can by any price or
ransom prolong his life that so he may still continue to labour here
and live to the end of the world Others understand it of the eternal
sorrows and dying life of hell which is the dreadful consequence of
dying in sin

4810 And shall still live unto the end

4811 He shall not see destruction when he shall see the wise dying
the senseless and the fool shall perish together And they shall leave
their riches to strangers

He shall not see destruction etc  Or shall he not see destruction
As much as to say however thoughtless he may be of his death he must
not expect to escape when even the wise and the good are not exempt
from dying

4812 And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever Their
dwelling places to all generations they have called their lands by
their names

They have called etc  That is they have left their names on their
graves which alone remain of their lands

4813 And man when he was in honour did not understand he is compared
to senseless beasts and is become like to them

4814 This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them and afterwards
they shall delight in their mouth

They shall delight in their mouth  Notwithstanding the wretched way
in which they walk they shall applaud themselves with their mouths
and glory in their doings

4815 They are laid in hell like sheep death shall feed upon them
And the just shall have dominion over them in the morning and their
help shall decay in hell from their glory

In the morning  That is in the resurrection to a new life when the
just shall judge and condemn the wicked Ibid From their
glory  That is when their shortlived glory in this world shall be
past and be no more

4816 But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell when he shall
receive me

4817 Be not thou afraid when a man shall be made rick and when the
glory of his house shall be increased

4818 For when he shall die he shall take nothing away nor shall his
glory descend with him

4819 For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed and he will praise
thee when thou shalt do well to him

4820 He shall go in to the generations of his fathers and he shall
never see light

4821 Man when he was in honour did not understand he hath been
compared to senseless beasts and made like to them



Psalms Chapter 49


Deus deorum

The coming of Christ who prefers virtue and inward purity before the
blood of victims

491 A psalm for Asaph The God of gods the Lord hath spoken and he
hath called the earth From the rising of the sun to the going down
thereof

492 Out of Sion the loveliness of his beauty

493 God shall come manifestly our God shall come and shall not keep
silence A fire shall burn before him and a mighty tempest shall be
round about him

494 He shall call heaven from above and the earth to judge his
people

495 Gather ye together his saints to him who set his covenant before
sacrifices

496 And the heavens shall declare his justice for God is judge

497 Hear O my people and I will speak O Israel and I will testify
to thee I am God thy God

498 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices and thy burnt
offerings are always in my sight

499 I will not take calves out of thy house nor he goats out of thy
flocks

4910 For all the beasts of the woods are mine the cattle on the
hills and the oxen

4911 I know all the fowls of the air and with me is the beauty of
the field

4912 If I should be hungry I would not tell thee for the world is
mine and the fulness thereof

4913 Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks or shall I drink the blood of
goats

4914 Offer to God the sacrifice of praise and pay thy vows to the
most High

4915 And call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee and
thou shalt glorify me

4916 But to the sinner God hath said Why dost thou declare my
justices and take my covenant in thy mouth

4917 Seeing thou hast hated discipline and hast cast my words behind
thee

4918 If thou didst see a thief thou didst run with him and with
adulterers thou hast been a partaker

4919 Thy mouth hath abounded with evil and thy tongue framed
deceits

4920 Sitting thou didst speak against thy brother and didst lay a
scandal against thy mothers son

4921 These things hast thou done and I was silent Thou thoughtest
unjustly that I should be like to thee but I will reprove thee and
set before thy face

4922 Understand these things you that forget God lest he snatch you
away and there be none to deliver you

4923 The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me and there is the way
by which I will shew him the salvation of God



Psalms Chapter 50


Miserere

The repentance and confession of David after his sin The fourth
penitential psalm

501 Unto the end a psalm of David

502 When Nathan the prophet came to him after he had sinned with
Bethsabee 2 Kings 12

503 Have mercy on me O God according to thy great mercy And
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my iniquity

504 Wash me yet more from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin

505 For I know my iniquity and my sin is always before me

506 To thee only have I sinned and have done evil before thee that
thou mayst be justified in thy words and mayst overcome when thou art
judged

507 For behold I was conceived in iniquities and in sins did my
mother conceive me

508 For behold thou hast loved truth the uncertain and hidden things
of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me

509 Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed thou
shalt wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow

5010 To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness and the bones
that have been humbled shall rejoice

5011 Turn away thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities

5012 Create a clean heart in me O God and renew a right spirit
within my bowels

5013 Cast me not away from thy face and take not thy holy spirit
from me

5014 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and strengthen me with
a perfect spirit

5015 I will teach the unjust thy ways and the wicked shall be
converted to thee

5016 Deliver me from blood O God thou God of my salvation and my
tongue shall extol thy justice

5017 O Lord thou wilt open my lips and my mouth shall declare thy
praise

5018 For if thou hadst desired sacrifice I would indeed have given
it with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted

5019 A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit a contrite and
humbled heart O God thou wilt not despise

5020 Deal favourably O Lord in thy good will with Sion that the
walls of Jerusalem may be built up

5021 Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice oblations and
whole burnt offerings then shall they lay calves upon thy altar



Psalms Chapter 51


Quid gloriaris

David condemneth the wickedness of Doeg and foretelleth his
destruction

511 Unto the end understanding for David

512 When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul David went to the house
of Achimelech

513 Why dost thou glory in malice thou that art mighty in iniquity

514 All the day long thy tongue hath devised injustice as a sharp
razor thou hast wrought deceit

515 Thou hast loved malice more than goodness and iniquity rather
than to speak righteousness

516 Thou hast loved all the words of ruin O deceitful tongue

517 Therefore will God destroy thee for ever he will pluck thee out
and remove thee from thy dwelling place and thy root out of the land
of the living

518 The just shall see and fear and shall laugh at him and say

519 Behold the man that made not God his helper But trusted in the
abundance of his riches and prevailed in his vanity

5110 But I as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God have hoped
in the mercy of God for ever yea for ever and ever

5111 I will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and I
will wait on thy name for it is good in the sight of thy saints



Psalms Chapter 52


Dixit insipiens

The general corruption of man before the coming of Christ

521 Unto the end for Maeleth understandings to David The fool said
in his heart There is no God

Maeleth  Or Machalath A musical instrument or a chorus of
musicians for St Jerome renders it per chorum

522 They are corrupted and become abominable in iniquities there is
none that doth good

523 God looked down from heaven on the children of men to see if
there were any that did understand or did seek God

524 All have gone aside they are become unprofitable together there
is none that doth good no not one

525 Shall not all the workers of iniquity know who eat up my people
as they eat bread

526 They have not called upon God there have they trembled for fear
where there was no fear For God hath scattered the bones of them that
please men they have been confounded because God hath despised them

God hath scattered the bones etc  That is God has brought to
nothing the strength of all those that seek to please men to the
prejudice of their duty to their Maker

527 Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel when God shall
bring back the captivity of his people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel
shall be glad



Psalms Chapter 53


Deus in nomine tuo

A prayer for help in distress

531 Unto the end in verses understanding for David

532 When the en of Ziph had come and said to Saul Is not David
hidden with us 1 Kings 2319

533 Save me O God by thy name and judge me in thy strength

534 O God hear my prayer give ear to the words of my mouth

535 For strangers have risen up against me and the mighty have
sought after my soul and they have not set God before their eyes

536 For behold God is my helper and the Lord is the protector of my
soul

537 Turn back the evils upon my enemies and cut them off in thy
truth

538 I will freely sacrifice to thee and will give praise O God to
thy name because it is good

539 For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble and my eye hath
looked down upon my enemies



Psalms Chapter 54


Exaudi Deus

A prayer of a just man under persecution from the wicked It agrees to
Christ persecuted by the Jews and betrayed by Judas

541 Unto the end in verses understanding for David

542 Hear O God my prayer and despise not my supplication

543 Be attentive to me and hear me I am grieved in my exercise and
am troubled

544 At the voice of the enemy and at the tribulation of the sinner
For they have cast iniquities upon me and in wrath they were
troublesome to me

545 My heart is troubled within me and the fear of death is fallen
upon me

546 Fear and trembling are come upon me and darkness hath covered
me

547 And I said Who will give me wings like a dove and I will fly
and be at rest

548 Lo I have gone far off flying away and I abode in the
wilderness

549 I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit
and a storm

5410 Cast down O Lord and divide their tongues for I have seen
iniquity and contradiction in the city

5411 Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls and in
the midst thereof are labour

5412 And injustice And usury and deceit have not departed from its
streets

5413 For if my enemy had reviled me I would verily have borne with
it And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me I would
perhaps have hidden my self from him

5414 But thou a man of one mind my guide and my familiar

5415 Who didst take sweetmeats together with me in the house of God
we walked with consent

5416 Let death come upon them and let them go down alive into hell
For there is wickedness in their dwellings in the midst of them

Let death etc  This and such like imprecations which occur in the
psalms are delivered prophetically that is by way of foretelling the
punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice and
approving the righteous ways of God but not by way of ill will or
uncharitable curses which the law of God disallows

5417 But I have cried to God and the Lord will save me

5418 Evening and morning and at noon I will speak and declare and
he shall hear my voice

5419 He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me
for among many they were with me

Among many etc  That is they that drew near to attack me were many
in company all combined to fight against me

5420 God shall hear and the Eternal shall humble them For there is
no change with them and they have not feared God

5421 He hath stretched forth his hand to repay They have defiled his
covenant

5422 They are divided by the wrath of his countenance and his heart
hath drawn near His words are smoother than oil and the same are
darts

They are divided etc  Dispersed scattered and brought to nothing
by the wrath of God who looks with indignation on their wicked and
deceitful ways

5423 Cast thy care upon the Lord and he shall sustain thee he shall
not suffer the just to waver for ever

5424 But thou O God shalt bring them down into the pit of
destruction Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days but I will trust in thee O Lord



Psalms Chapter 55


Miserere mei Deus

A prayer of David in danger and distress

551 Unto the end for a people that is removed at a distance form the
sanctuary for David for an inscription of a title or pillar when
the Philistines held him in Geth

552 Have mercy on me O God for man hath trodden me under foot all
the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me

553 My enemies have trodden on me all the day long for they are many
that make war against me

554 From the height of the day I shall fear but I will trust in
thee

The height of the day  That is even at noonday when the sun is the
highest I am still in danger

555 In God I will praise my words in God I have put my trust I will
not fear what flesh can do against me

My words  The words or promises God has made in my favour

556 All the day long they detested my words all their thoughts were
against me unto evil

557 They will dwell and hide themselves they will watch my heel As
they have waited for my soul

558 For nothing shalt thou save them in thy anger thou shalt break
the people in pieces O God

For nothing shalt thou save them  That is since they lie in wait to
ruin my soul thou shalt for no consideration favour or assist them
but execute thy justice upon them

559 I have declared to thee my life thou hast set me tears in thy
sight As also in thy promise

5510 Then shall my enemies be turned back In what day soever I shall
call upon thee behold I know thou art my God

5511 In God will I praise the word in the Lord will I praise his
speech In God have I hoped I will not fear what man can do to me

5512 In me O God are vows to thee which I will pay praises to
thee

5513 Because thou hast delivered my soul from death my feet from
falling that I may please in the sight of God in the light of the
living



Psalms Chapter 56


Miserere mei Deus The prophet prays in his affliction and praises
God for his delivery

561 Unto the end destroy not for David for an inscription of a
title when he fled from Saul into the cave 1 Kings 24

Destroy not  Suffer me not to be destroyed

562 Have mercy on me O God have mercy on me for my soul trusteth
in thee And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope until iniquity
pass away

563 I will cry to God the most high to God who hath done good to me

564 He hath sent from heaven and delivered me he hath made them a
reproach that trod upon me God hath sent his mercy and his truth

565 And he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions
I slept troubled The sons of men whose teeth are weapons and arrows
and their tongue a sharp sword

566 Be thou exalted O God above the heavens and thy glory above
all the earth

567 They prepared a snare for my feet and they bowed down my soul
They dug a pit before my face and they are fallen into it

568 My heart is ready O God my heart is ready I will sing and
rehearse a psalm

569 Arise O my glory arise psaltery and harp I will arise early

5610 I will give praise to thee O Lord among the people I will
sing a psalm to thee among the nations

5611 For thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens and thy truth
unto the clouds

5612 Be thou exalted O God above the heavens and thy glory above
all the earth



Psalms Chapter 57


Si vere utique

David reproveth the wicked and foretelleth their punishment

571 Unto the end destroy not for David for an inscription of a
title

572 If in very deed ye speak justice judge right things ye sons of
men

573 For in your heart you work iniquity your hands forge injustice
in the earth

574 The wicked are alienated from the womb they have gone astray
from the womb they have spoken false things

575 Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent like the
deaf asp that stoppeth her ears

576 Which will not hear the voice of the charmers nor of the wizard
that charmeth wisely

577 God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth the Lord
shall break the grinders of the lions

578 They shall come to nothing like water running down he hath bent
his bow till they be weakened

579 Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away fire hath fallen
on them and they shall not see the sun

5710 Before your thorns could know the brier he swalloweth them up
as alive in his wrath

Before your thorns etc  That is before your thorns grow up so as
to become strong briers they shall be overtaken and consumed by divine
justice swallowing them up as it were alive in his wrath

5711 The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge he shall
wash his hands in the blood of the sinner

Shall wash his hands etc  Shall applaud the justice of God and take
occasion from the consideration of the punishment of the wicked to wash
and cleanse his hands from sin

5712 And man shall say If indeed there be fruit to the just there
is indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth



Psalms Chapter 58

582 Deliver me from my enemies O my God and defend me from them
that rise up against me

583 Deliver me from them that work iniquity and save me from bloody
men

584 For behold they have caught my soul the mighty have rushed in
upon me

585 Neither is it my iniquity nor my sin O Lord without iniquity
have I run and directed my steps

586 Rise up thou to meet me and behold even thou O Lord the God
of hosts the God of Israel Attend to visit all the nations have no
mercy on all them that work iniquity

587 They shall return at evening and shall suffer hunger like dogs
and shall go round about the city

588 Behold they shall speak with their mouth and a sword is in their
lips for who say they hath heard us

589 But thou O Lord shalt laugh at them thou shalt bring all the
nations to nothing

5810 I will keep my strength to thee for thou art my protector

5811 My God his mercy shall prevent me

5812 God shall let me see over my enemies slay them not lest at any
time my people forget Scatter them by thy power and bring them down
O Lord my protector

5813 For the sin of their mouth and the word of their lips and let
them be taken in their pride And for their cursing and lying they
shall be talked of

5814 When they are consumed when they are consumed by thy wrath and
they shall be no more And they shall know that God will rule Jacob
and all the ends of the earth

5815 They shall return at evening and shall suffer hunger like dogs
and shall go round about the city

5816 They shall be scattered abroad to eat and shall murmur if they
be not filled

5817 But I will sing thy strength and will extol thy mercy in the
morning For thou art become my support and my refuge in the day of
my trouble

5818 Unto thee O my helper will I sing for thou art God my
defence my God my mercy

of a title to David himself for doctrine

592 When he set fire to Mesopotamia of Syria and Sobal and Joab
returned and slew of Edom in the vale of the saltpits twelve thousand
men

593 O God thou hast cast us off and hast destroyed us thou hast
been angry and hast had mercy on us

594 Thou hast moved the earth and hast troubled it heal thou the
breaches thereof for it has been moved

595 Thou hast shewn thy people hard things thou hast made us drink
the wine of sorrow

596 Thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee that they may
flee from before the bow That thy beloved may be delivered

597 Save me with thy right hand and hear me

598 God hath spoken in his holy place I will rejoice and I will
divide Sichem and will mete out the vale of tabernacles

599 Galaad is mine and Manasses is mine and Ephraim is the strength
of my head Juda is my king

5910 Moab is the pot of my hope Into Edom will I stretch out my
shoe to me the foreigners are made subject

The pot of my hope  Or my watering pot That is a vessel for meaner
uses by being reduced to serve me even in the meanest
employmentsIbid Foreigners  So the Philistines are called who
had no kindred with the Israelites whereas the Edomites Moabites etc
were originally of the same family

5911 Who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into
Edom

God go out with our armies

5914 Through God we shall do mightily and he shall bring to nothing
them that afflict us

Nonne Deo

The prophet encourageth himself and all others to trust in God and
serve him

611 Unto the end for Idithun a psalm of David

612 Shall not my soul be subject to God for from him is my
salvation

613 For he is my God and my saviour he is my protector I shall be
moved no more

614 How long do you rush in upon a man you all kill as if you were
thrusting down a leaning wall and a tottering fence

615 But they have thought to cast away my price I ran in thirst
they blessed with their mouth but cursed with their heart

616 But be thou O my soul subject to God for from him is my
patience

617 For he is my God and my saviour he is my helper I shall not be
moved

618 In God is my salvation and my glory he is the God of my help
and my hope is in God

619 Trust in him all ye congregation of people pour out your hearts
before him God is our helper for ever

6110 But vain are the sons of men the sons of men are liars in the
balances that by vanity they may together deceive

Are liars in the balances etc  They are so vain and light that if
they are put into the scales they will be found to be of no weight
and to be mere lies deceit and vanity Or They are liars in their
balances by weighing things by false weights and preferring the
temporal before the eternal

6111 Trust not in iniquity and cover not robberies if riches
abound set not your heart upon them

6112 God hath spoken once these two things have I heard that power
belongeth to God

6113 And mercy to thee O Lord for thou wilt render to every man
according to his works



Psalms Chapter 62


Deus Deus meus ad te

The prophet aspireth after God

621 A psalm of David while he was in the desert of Edom

622 O God my God to thee do I watch at break of day For thee my
soul hath thirsted for thee my flesh O how many ways

623 In a desert land and where there is no way and no water so in
the sanctuary have I come before thee to see thy power and thy glory

624 For thy mercy is better than lives thee my lips will praise

625 Thus will I bless thee all my life long and in thy name I will
lift up my hands

626 Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness and my mouth
shall praise thee with joyful lips

627 If I have remembered thee upon my bed I will meditate on thee in
the morning

628 Because thou hast been my helper And I will rejoice under the
covert of thy wings

629 My soul hath stuck close to thee thy right hand hath received
me

6210 But they have fought my soul in vain they shall go into the
lower parts of the earth

6211 They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword they shall
be the portions of foxes

6212 But the king shall rejoice in God all they shall be praised
that swear by him because the mouth is stopped of them that speak
wicked things



Psalms Chapter 63


Exaudi Deus orationem

A prayer in affliction with confidence in God that he will bring to
nought the machinations of persecutors

631 Unto the end a psalm for David

632 Hear O God my prayer when I make supplication to thee deliver
my soul from the fear of the enemy

633 Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant from
the multitude of the workers of iniquity

634 For they have whetted their tongues like a sword they have bent
their bow a bitter thing

635 To shoot in secret the undefiled

636 They will shoot at him on a sudden and will not fear they are
resolute in wickedness They have talked of hiding snares they have
said Who shall see them

637 They have searched after iniquities they have failed in their
search Man shall come to a deep heart

A deep heart  That is crafty subtle deep projects and designs
which nevertheless shall not succeed for God shall be exalted in
bringing them to nought by his wisdom and power

638 And God shall be exalted The arrows of children are their
wounds

The arrows of children are their wounds  That is the wounds
stripes or blows they seek to inflict upon the just are but like the
weak efforts of childrens arrows which can do no execution and their
tongues that is their speeches against them come to nothing

639 And their tongues against them are made weak All that saw them
were troubled

6310 And every man was afraid And they declared the works of God
and understood his doings

6311 The just shall rejoice in the Lord and shall hope in him and
all the upright in heart shall be praised



Psalms Chapter 64


Te decet

God is to be praised in his church to which all nations shall be
called

641 To the end a psalm of David The canticle of Jeremias and
Ezechiel to the people of the captivity when they began to go out

Of the captivity  That is the people of the captivity of Babylon
This is not in the Hebrew but is found in the ancient translation of
the Septuagint

642 A hymn O God becometh thee in Sion and a vow shall be paid to
thee in Jerusalem

643 O hear my prayer all flesh shall come to thee

644 The words of the wicked have prevailed over us and thou wilt
pardon our transgressions

645 Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee he shall
dwell in thy courts We shall be filled with the good things of thy
house holy is thy temple

646 Wonderful in justice Hear us O God our saviour who art the
hope of all the ends of the earth and in the sea afar off

647 Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength being girded
with power

648 Who troublest the depth of the sea the noise of its waves The
Gentiles shall be troubled

649 And they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at
thy signs thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the
evening to be joyful

6410 Thou hast visited the earth and hast plentifully watered it
thou hast many ways enriched it The river of God is filled with water
thou hast prepared their food for so is its preparation

6411 Fill up plentifully the streams thereof multiply its fruits it
shall spring up and rejoice in its showers

6412 Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of thy goodness and thy
fields shall be filled with plenty

6413 The beautiful places of the wilderness shall grow fat and the
hills shall be girded about with joy

6414 The rams of the flock are clothed and the vales shall abound
with corn they shall shout yea they shall sing a hymn



Psalms Chapter 65


Jubilate Deo

An invitation to praise God

651 Unto the end a canticle of a psalm of the resurrection Shout
with joy to God all the earth

652 Sing ye a psalm to his name give glory to his praise

653 Say unto God How terrible are thy works O Lord in the
multitude of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee

654 Let all the earth adore thee and sing to thee let it sing a
psalm to thy name

655 Come and see the works of God who is terrible in his counsels
over the sons of men

656 Who turneth the sea into dry land in the river they shall pass
on foot there shall we rejoice in him

657 Who by his power ruleth for ever his eyes behold the nations
let not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves

658 O bless our God ye Gentiles and make the voice of his praise to
be heard

659 Who hath set my soul to live and hath not suffered my feet to be
moved

6510 For thou O God hast proved us thou hast tried us by fire as
silver is tried

6511 Thou hast brought us into a net thou hast laid afflictions on
our back

6512 Thou hast set men over our heads We have passed through fire
and water and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment

6513 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings I will pay thee
my vows

6514 Which my lips have uttered And my mouth hath spoken when I was
in trouble

6515 I will offer up to thee holocausts full of marrow with burnt

6516 Come and hear all ye that fear God and I will tell you what
great things he hath done for my soul

6517 I cried to him with my mouth and I extolled him with my tongue

6518 If I have looked at iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear
me

my supplication

6520 Blessed be God who hath not turned away my prayer nor his
mercy from me



Psalms Chapter 66

his countenance to shine upon us and may he have mercy on us

663 That we may know thy way upon earth thy salvation in all

Psalms Chapter 67


Exurgat Deus

The glorious establishment of the church of the New Testament
prefigured by the benefits bestowed on the people of Israel

671 Unto the end a psalm of a canticle for David himself

672 Let God arise and let his enemies be scattered and let them
that hate him flee from before his face

673 As smoke vanisheth so let them vanish away as wax melteth
before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of God

674 And let the just feast and rejoice before God and be delighted
with gladness

675 Sing ye to God sing a psalm to his name make a way for him who
ascendeth upon the west the Lord is his name Rejoice ye before him
but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence

Who ascendeth upon the west  Super occasum St Gregory understands
it of Christ who after his going down like the sun in the west by
his passion and death ascended more glorious and carried all before
him St Jerome renders it who ascendeth or cometh up through the
deserts

676 Who is the father of orphans and the judge of widows God in his
holy place

677 God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house Who
bringeth out them that were bound in strength in like manner them that
provoke that dwell in sepulchres

Of one manner  That is agreeing in faith unanimous in love and
following the same manner of discipline It is verified in the servants
of God living together in his house which is the church 1 Tim
315Ibid Them that were bound etc  The power and mercy of God
appears in his bringing out of their captivity those that were strongly
bound in their sins and in restoring to his grace those whose
behaviour had been most provoking and who by their evil habits were
not only dead but buried in their sepulchres

678 O God when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people when
thou didst pass through the desert

679 The earth was moved and the heavens dropped at the presence of
the God of Sina at the presence of the God of Israel

6710 Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain O God and
it was weakened but thou hast made it perfect

A free rain  the manna which rained plentifully from heaven in
favour of Gods inheritance that is of his people Israel which was
weakened indeed under a variety of afflictions but was made perfect by
God that is was still supported by divine providence and brought on
to the promised land It agrees particularly to the church of Christ
his true inheritance which is plentifully watered with the free rain
of heavenly grace and through many infirmities that is crosses and
tribulations is made perfect and fitted for eternal glory

6711 In it shall thy animals dwell in thy sweetness O God thou
hast provided for the poor

In it etc  That is in this church which is thy fold and thy
inheritance shall thy animals thy sheep dwell where thou hast
plentifully provided for them

6712 The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings
with great power

To them that preach good tidings  Evangelizantibus That is to the
preachers of the gospel who receiving the word from the Lord shall
with great power and efficacy preach throughout the world the glad
tidings of a Saviour and of eternal salvation through him

6713 The king of powers is of the beloved of the beloved and the
beauty of the house shall divide spoils

The king of powers  That is the mighty King the Lord of hosts is
of the beloved of the beloved that is is on the side of Christ his
most beloved son and his beautiful house viz the church in which
God dwells forever shall by her spiritual conquests divide the spoils
of many nations The Hebrew as it now stands pointed is thus
rendered The kings of armies have fled they have fled and she that
dwells at home or the beauty of the house shall divide the spoils

6714 If you sleep among the midst of lots you shall be as the wings
of a dove covered with silver and the hinder parts of her back with
the paleness of gold

If you sleep among the midst of lots intermedios cleros etc  Viz
in such dangers and persecutions as if your enemies were casting
lots for your goods and persons or in the midst of the lots
intermedios terminos as St Jerome renders it that is upon the
very bounds or borders of the dominions of your enemies you shall be
secure nevertheless under the divine protection and shall be enabled
to fly away like a dove with glittering wings and feathers shining
like the palest and most precious gold that is with great increase of
virtue and glowing with the fervour of charity

6715 When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her they shall
be whited with snow in Selmon

Kings over her  That is pastors and rulers over his church viz
the apostles and their successors Then by their ministry shall men be
made whiter than the snow which lies on the top of the high mountain
Selmon

6716 The mountain of God is a fat mountain A curdled mountain a fat
mountain

The mountain of God  The church which Isa 22 is called The
mountain of the house of the Lord upon the top of mountains It is here
called a fat and a curdled mountain that is to say most fruitful and
enriched by the spiritual gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost

6717 Why suspect ye curdled mountains A mountain in which God is
well pleased to dwell for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end

Why suspect ye curdled mountains  Why do you suppose or imagine
there may be any other such curdled mountains You are mistaken the
mountain thus favoured by God is but one and this same he has chosen
for his dwelling for ever

6718 The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands thousands of
them that rejoice the Lord is among them in Sina in the holy place

The chariot of God  Descending to give his law on mount Sina as also
of Jesus Christ his Son ascending into heaven to send from thence the
Holy Ghost to publish his new law is attended with ten thousands
that is with an innumerable multitude of joyful angels

6719 Thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive
thou hast received gifts in men Yea for those also that do not
believe the dwelling of the Lord God

Led captivity captive  Carrying away with thee to heaven those who
before had been the captives of Satan and receiving from God the
Father gifts to be distributed to men even to those who were before
unbelievers

6720 Blessed be the Lord day by day the God of our salvation will
make our journey prosperous to us

6721 Our God is the God of salvation and of the Lord of the Lord
are the issues from death

The issues from death  The Lord alone is master of the issues by
which we may escape from death

6722 But God shall break the heads of his enemies the hairy crown of
them that walk on in their sins

6723 The Lord said I will turn them from Basan I will turn them
into the depth of the sea

I will turn them from Basan etc  I will cast out my enemies from
their rich possessions signified by Basan a fruitful country and I
will drive them into the depth of the sea and make such a slaughter of
them that the feet of my servants may be dyed in their blood etc

6724 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies the
tongue of thy dogs be red with the same

6725 They have seen thy goings O God the goings of my God of my
king who is in his sanctuary

Thy goings  Thy ways thy proceedings by which thou didst formerly
take possession of the promised land in favour of thy people and shalt
afterwards of the whole world which thou shalt subdue to thy Son

6726 Princes went before joined with singers in the midst of young
damsels playing on timbrels

Princes  The apostles the first converters of nations attended by
numbers of perfect souls singing the divine praises and virgins
consecrated to God

6727 In the churches bless ye God the Lord from the fountains of
Israel

From the fountains of Israel  From whom both Christ and his apostles
sprung By Benjamin the holy fathers on this place understand St
Paul who was of that tribe named here a youth because he was the
last called to the apostleship By the princes of Juda Zabulon and
Nephthali we may understand the other apostles who were of the tribe
of Juda or of the tribes of Zabulon and Nephthali where our Lord
began to preach Matt 413 etc

6728 There is Benjamin a youth in ecstasy of mind The princes of
Juda are their leaders the princes of Zabulon the princes of
Nephthali

6729 Command thy strength O God confirm O God what thou hast
wrought in us

Command thy strength  Give orders that thy strength may be always with
us

6730 From thy temple in Jerusalem kings shall offer presents to
thee

6731 Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds the congregation of bulls
with the kine of the people who seek to exclude them who are tried
with silver Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars

Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds  or the wild beasts which lie
hid in the reeds That is the devils who hide themselves in order to
surprise their prey Or by wild beasts are here understood
persecutors who for all their attempts against the Church are but as
weak reeds which cannot prevail against them who are supported by the
strength of the Almighty The same are also called the congregation of
bulls from their rage against the Church who assemble together all
their kine that is the people their subjects to exclude if they can
from Christ and his inheritance his constant confessors who are like
silver tried by fire

6732 Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt Ethiopia shall soon stretch
out her hands to God

Ambassadors shall come etc  It is a prophecy of the conversion of
the Gentiles and by name of the Egyptians and Ethiopians

6733 Sing to God ye kingdoms of the earth sing ye to the Lord Sing
ye to God

6734 Who mounteth above the heaven of heavens to the east Behold he
will give to his voice the voice of power

To the east  From mount Olivet which is on the east side of
JerusalemIbid The voice of power  That is he will make his voice
to be a powerful voice by calling from death to life such as were
dead in mortal sin as at the last day he will by the power of his
voice call all the dead from their graves

6735 Give ye glory to God for Israel his magnificence and his power
is in the clouds

6736 God is wonderful in his saints the God of Israel is he who will
give power and strength to his people Blessed be God



Psalms Chapter 68


Salvum me fac Deus

Christ in his passion declareth the greatness of his sufferings and
the malice of his persecutors the Jews and foretelleth their
reprobation

681 Unto the end for them that shall be changed for David

For them that shall be changed  A psalm for Christian converts to
remember the passion of Christ

682 Save me O God for the waters are come in even unto my soul

The waters  Of afflictions and sorrows My soul is sorrowful even
unto death Matt 2638

683 I stick fast in the mire of the deep and there is no sure
standing I am come into the depth of the sea and a tempest hath
overwhelmed me

684 I have laboured with crying my jaws are become hoarse my eyes
have failed whilst I hope in my God

685 They are multiplied above the hairs of my head who hate me
without cause My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully
persecuted me then did I pay that which I took not away

I pay that which I took not away  Christ in his passion made
restitution of what he had not taken away by suffering the punishment
due to our sins and so repairing the injury we had done to God

686 O God thou knowest my foolishness and my offences are not
hidden from thee

My foolishness and my offences  which my enemies impute to me or the
follies and sins of men which I have taken upon myself

687 Let not them be ashamed for me who look for thee O Lord the
Lord of hosts Let them not be confounded on my account who seek thee
O God of Israel

688 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach shame hath covered my
face

689 I am become a stranger to my brethren and an alien to the sons
of my mother

6810 For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up and the reproaches
of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me

6811 And I covered my soul in fasting and it was made a reproach to
me

6812 And I made haircloth my garment and I became a byword to them

6813 They that sat in the gate spoke against me and they that drank
wine made me their song

6814 But as for me my prayer is to thee O Lord for the time of thy
good pleasure O God In the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the
truth of thy salvation

6815 Draw me out of the mire that I may not stick fast deliver me
from them that hate me and out of the deep waters

6816 Let not the tempest of water drown me nor the deep water
swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me

6817 Hear me O Lord for thy mercy is kind look upon me according
to the multitude of thy tender mercies

6818 And turn not away thy face from thy servant for I am in
trouble hear me speedily

6819 Attend to my soul and deliver it save me because of my
enemies

6820 Thou knowest my reproach and my confusion and my shame

6821 In thy sight are all they that afflict me my heart hath
expected reproach and misery And I looked for one that would grieve
together with me but there was none and for one that would comfort
me and I found none

6822 And they gave me gall for my food and in my thirst they gave me
vinegar to drink

6823 Let their table become as a snare before them and a recompense
and a stumblingblock

Let their table etc  What here follows in the style of an
imprecation is a prophecy of the wretched state to which the Jews
should be reduced in punishment of their wilful obstinacy

6824 Let their eyes be darkened that they see not and their back
bend thou down always

6825 Pour out thy indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger
take hold of them

6826 Let their habitation be made desolate and let there be none to
dwell in their tabernacles

6827 Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten and
they have added to the grief of my wounds

6828 Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity and let them not come
into thy justice

6829 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living and with the
just let them not be written

6830 But I am poor and sorrowful thy salvation O God hath set me
up

6831 I will praise the name of God with a canticle and I will
magnify him with praise

6832 And it shall please God better than a young calf that bringeth
forth horns and hoofs

6833 Let the poor see and rejoice seek ye God and your soul shall
live

6834 For the Lord hath heard the poor and hath not despised his
prisoners

6835 Let the heavens and the earth praise him the sea and every
thing that creepeth therein

6836 For God will save Sion and the cities of Juda shall be built
up And they shall dwell there and acquire it by inheritance

Sion  The catholic church The cities of Juda etc her places of
worship which shall be established throughout the world And there
viz in this church of Christ shall his servants dwell etc

6837 And the seed of his servants shall possess it and they that
love his name shall dwell therein



Psalms Chapter 69


Deus in adjutorium

A prayer in persecution

691 Unto the end a psalm for David to bring to remembrance that the
Lord saved him

692 O God come to my assistance O Lord make haste to help me

693 Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul

694 Let them be turned backward and blush for shame that desire
evils to me Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that
say to me Tis well tis well

T is well t is well  Euge euge St Jerome renders it vah vah
which is the voice of one insulting and deriding Some understand it as
a detestation of deceitful flatterers

695 Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such
as love thy salvation say always The Lord be magnified

696 But I am needy and poor O God help me Thou art my helper and
my deliverer O lord make no delay



Psalms Chapter 70


In te Domine

A prayer for perseverance

701 A psalm for David Of the sons of Jonadab and the former
captives In thee O Lord I have hoped let me never be put to
confusion

Of the sons of Jonadab  The Rechabites of whom see Jer 35 By this
addition of the seventytwo interpreters we gather that this psalm was
usually sung in the synagogue in the person of the Rechabites and of
those who were first carried away into captivity

702 Deliver me in thy justice and rescue me Incline thy ear unto
me and save me

703 Be thou unto me a God a protector and a place of strength that
thou mayst make me safe For thou art my firmament and my refuge

704 Deliver me O my God out of the hand of the sinner and out of
the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust

705 For thou art my patience O Lord my hope O Lord from my youth

706 By thee have I been confirmed from the womb from my mothers
womb thou art my protector Of thee I shall continually sing

707 I am become unto many as a wonder but thou art a strong helper

708 Let my mouth be filled with praise that I may sing thy glory
thy greatness all the day long

709 Cast me not off in the time of old age when my strength shall
fail do not thou forsake me

7010 For my enemies have spoken against me and they that watched my
soul have consulted together

7011 Saying God hath forsaken him pursue and take him for there is
none to deliver him

7012 O God be not thou far from me O my God make haste to my help

7013 Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul
let them be covered with confusion and blame that seek my hurt

7014 But I will always hope and will add to all thy praise

7015 My mouth shall shew forth thy justice thy salvation all the day
long Because I have not known learning

Learning  As much as to say I build not upon human learning but
only on the power and justice of God

7016 I will enter into the powers of the Lord O Lord I will be
mindful of thy justice alone

7017 Thou hast taught me O God from my youth and till now I will
declare thy wonderful works

7018 And unto old age and grey hairs O God forsake me not Until I
shew forth thy arm to all the generation that is to come Thy power

7019 And thy justice O God even to the highest great things thou
hast done O God who is like to thee

7020 How great troubles hast thou shewn me many and grievous and
turning thou hast brought me to life and hast brought me back again
from the depths of the earth

7021 Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence and turning to me thou
hast comforted me

7022 For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments
of psaltery O God I will sing to thee with the harp thou holy one of
Israel

7023 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I shall sing to thee and my
soul which thou hast redeemed

7024 Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day
when they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me



Psalms Chapter 71


Deus judicium tuum

A prophecy of the coming of Christ and of his kingdom prefigured by
Solomon and his happy reign

711 A psalm on Solomon

712 Give to the king thy judgment O God and to the kings son thy
justice To judge thy people with justice and thy poor with judgment

713 Let the mountains receive peace for the people and the hills
justice

714 He shall judge the poor of the people and he shall save the
children of the poor and he shall humble the oppressor

715 And he shall continue with the sun and before the moon
throughout all generations

716 He shall come down like rain upon the fleece and as showers
falling gently upon the earth

717 In his days shall justice spring up and abundance of peace till
the moon be taken away

718 And he shall rule from sea to sea and from the river unto the
ends of the earth

719 Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down and his enemies shall
lick the ground

7110 The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents the
kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts

7111 And all kings of the earth shall adore him all nations shall
serve him

7112 For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty and the needy
that had no helper

7113 He shall spare the poor and needy and he shall save the souls
of the poor

7114 He shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity and their
names shall be honourable in his sight

7115 And he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of
Arabia for him they shall always adore they shall bless him all the
day

7116 And there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of
mountains above Libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted and they
of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth

A firmament on the earth etc  This may be understood of the church
of Christ ever firm and visible and of the flourishing condition of
its congregation

7117 Let his name be blessed for evermore his name continueth before
the sun And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed all
nations shall magnify him

7118 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel who alone doth wonderful
things

7119 And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever and the whole
earth shall be filled with his majesty So be it So be it

7120 The praises of David the son of Jesse are ended

Are ended  By this it appears that this psalm though placed here
was in order of time the last of those which David composed



Psalms Chapter 72


Quam bonus Israel Deus

The temptation of the weak upon seeing the prosperity of the wicked
is overcome by the consideration of the justice of God who will
quickly render to every one according to his works

721 A psalm for Asaph How good is God to Israel to them that are of
a right heart

722 But my feet were almost moved my steps had well nigh slipped

723 Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked seeing the
prosperity of sinners

724 For there is no regard to their death nor is there strength in
their stripes

725 They are not in the labour of men neither shall they be scourged
like other men

726 Therefore pride hath held them fast they are covered with their
iniquity and their wickedness

727 Their iniquity hath come forth as it were from fatness they
have passed into the affection of the heart

Fatness  Abundance and temporal prosperity which hath encouraged
them in their iniquity and made them give themselves up to their
irregular affections

728 They have thought and spoken wickedness they have spoken
iniquity on high

729 They have set their mouth against heaven and their tongue hath
passed through the earth

7210 Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be
found in them

Return here  or hither The weak among the servants of God will be
apt often to return to this thought and will be shocked when they
consider the full days that is the long and prosperous life of the
wicked and will be tempted to make the reflections against providence
which are set down in the following verses

7211 And they said How doth God know and is there knowledge in the
most High

7212 Behold these are sinners and yet abounding in the world they
have obtained riches

7213 And I said Then have I in vain justified my heart and washed
my hands among the innocent

7214 And I have been scourged all the day and my chastisement hath
been in the mornings

7215 If I said I will speak thus behold I should condemn the
generation of thy children

If I said etc  That is if I should indulge such thoughts as these

7216 I studied that I might know this thing it is a labour in my
sight

7217 Until I go into the sanctuary of God and understand concerning
their last ends

7218 But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them when they were
lifted up thou hast cast them down

Thou hast put it to them  In punishment of their deceits or for
deceiving them thou hast brought evils upon them in their last end
which in their prosperity they never apprehended

7219 How are they brought to desolation they have suddenly ceased to
be they have perished by reason of their iniquity

7220 As the dream of them that awake O Lord so in thy city thou
shalt bring their image to nothing

7221 For my heart hath been inflamed and my reins have been changed

7222 And I am brought to nothing and I knew not

7223 I am become as a beast before thee and I am always with thee

7224 Thou hast held me by my right hand and by thy will thou hast
conducted me and with thy glory thou hast received me

7225 For what have I in heaven and besides thee what do I desire
upon earth

7226 For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away thou art the
God of my heart and the God that is my portion for ever

7227 For behold they that go far from thee shall perish thou hast
destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee

7228 But it is good for me to adhere to my God to put my hope in the
Lord God That I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the
daughter of Sion



Psalms Chapter 73


Ut quid Deus

A prayer of the church under grievous persecutions

731 Understanding for Asaph O God why hast thou cast us off unto
the end why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture

732 Remember thy congregation which thou hast possessed from the
beginning The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed
mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt

733 Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end see what
things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary

734 And they that hate thee have made their boasts in the midst of
thy solemnity They have set up their ensigns for signs

Their ensigns etc  They have fixed their colours for signs and
trophies both on the gates and on the highest top of the temple and
they knew not that is they regarded not the sanctity of the place
This psalm manifestly foretells the time of the Machabees and the
profanation of the temple by Antiochus

735 And they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top
As with axes in a wood of trees

736 They have cut down at once the gates thereof with axe and
hatchet they have brought it down

737 They have set fire to thy sanctuary they have defiled the
dwelling place of thy name on the earth

738 They said in their heart the whole kindred of them together Let
us abolish all the festival days of God from the land

739 Our signs we have not seen there is now no prophet and he will
know us no more

7310 How long O God shall the enemy reproach is the adversary to
provoke thy name for ever

7311 Why dost thou turn away thy hand and thy right hand out of the
midst of thy bosom for ever

7312 But God is our king before ages he hath wrought salvation in
the midst of the earth

7313 Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm thou didst crush
the heads of the dragons in the waters

The sea firm  By making the waters of the Red Sea stand like firm
walls whilst Israel passed through and destroying the Egyptians
called here dragons from their cruelty in the same waters with their
king casting up their bodies on the shore to be stripped by the
Ethiopians inhabiting in those days the coast of Arabia

7314 Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon thou hast given him to
be meat for the people of the Ethiopians

7315 Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents thou hast
dried up the Ethan rivers

Ethan rivers  That is rivers which run with strong streams This was
verified in Jordan Jos 3 and in Arnon Num 2114

7316 Thine is the day and thine is the night thou hast made the
morning light and the sun

7317 Thou hast made all the borders of the earth the summer and the
spring were formed by thee

7318 Remember this the enemy hath reproached the Lord and a foolish
people hath provoked thy name

7319 Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee and
forget not to the end the souls of thy poor

7320 Have regard to thy covenant for they that are the obscure of
the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity

The obscure of the earth  Mean and ignoble wretches have been filled
that is enriched with houses of iniquity that is with our estates
and possessions which they have unjustly acquired

7321 Let not the humble be turned away with confusion the poor and
needy shall praise thy name

7322 Arise O God judge thy own cause remember thy reproaches with
which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day

7323 Forget not the voices of thy enemies the pride of them that
hate thee ascendeth continually



Psalms Chapter 74


Confitebimur tibi

There is a just judgment to come therefore let the wicked take care

741 Unto the end corrupt not a psalm of a canticle for Asaph

Corrupt not  It is believed to have been the beginning of some ode or
hymn to the tune of which this psalm was to be sung St Augustine and
other fathers take it to be an admonition of the spirit of God not to
faint or fail in our hope but to persevere with constancy in good
because God will not fail in his due time to render to every man
according to his works

742 We will praise thee O God we will praise and we will call upon
thy name We will relate thy wondrous works

743 When I shall take a time I will judge justices

When I shall take a time  In proper times particularly at the last
day when the earth shall melt away at the presence of the great Judge
the same who originally laid the foundations of it and as it were
established its pillars

744 The earth is melted and all that dwell therein I have
established the pillars thereof

745 I said to the wicked Do not act wickedly and to the sinners
Lift not up the horn

746 Lift not up your horn on high speak not iniquity against God

747 For neither from the east nor from the west nor from the desert
hills

748 For God is the judge One he putteth down and another he lifteth
up

749 For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of
mixture And he hath poured it out from this to that but the dregs
thereof are not emptied all the sinners of the earth shall drink

7410 But I will declare for ever I will sing to the God of Jacob

7411 And I will break all the horns of sinners but the horns of the
just shall be exalted



Psalms Chapter 75


Notus in Judaea

God is known in his church and exerts his power in protecting it It
alludes to the slaughter of the Assyrians in the days of king
Ezechias

751 Unto the end in praises a psalm for Asaph a canticle to the
Assyrians

752 In Judea God is known his name is great in Israel

753 And his place is in peace and his abode in Sion

754 There hath he broken the powers of bows the shield the sword
and the battle

755 Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills

756 All the foolish of heart were troubled They have slept their
sleep and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands

757 At thy rebuke O God of Jacob they have all slumbered that
mounted on horseback

758 Thou art terrible and who shall resist thee from that time thy
wrath

From that time etc  From the time that thy wrath shall break out

759 Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven the earth
trembled and was still

7510 When God arose in judgment to save all the meek of the earth

7511 For the thought of man shall give praise to thee and the
remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee

7512 Vow ye and pay to the Lord your God all you that are round
about him bring presents To him that is terrible

7513 Even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes to the
terrible with the kings of the earth



Psalms Chapter 76


Voce mea

The faithful have recourse to God in trouble of mind with confidence
in his mercy and power

761 Unto the end for Idithun a psalm of Asaph

762 I cried to the Lord with my voice to God with my voice and he
gave ear to me

763 In the days of my trouble I sought God with my hands lifted up
to him in the night and I was not deceived My soul refused to be
comforted

764 I remembered God and was delighted and was exercised and my
spirit swooned away

765 My eyes prevented the watches I was troubled and I spoke not

766 I thought upon the days of old and I had in my mind the eternal
years

767 And I meditated in the night with my own heart and I was
exercised and I swept my spirit

768 Will God then cast off for ever or will he never be more
favourable again

769 Or will he cut off his mercy for ever from generation to
generation

7610 Or will God forget to shew mercy or will he in his anger shut
up his mercies

7611 And I said Now have I begun this is the change of the right
hand of the most High

7612 I remembered the works of the Lord for I will be mindful of thy
wonders from the beginning

7613 And I will meditate on all thy works and will be employed in
thy inventions

7614 Thy way O God is in the holy place who is the great God like
our God

7615 Thou art the God that dost wonders Thou hast made thy power
known among the nations

7616 With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob
and of Joseph

7617 The waters saw thee O God the waters saw thee and they were
afraid and the depths were troubled

7618 Great was the noise of the waters the clouds sent out a sound
For thy arrows pass

7619 The voice of thy thunder in a wheel Thy lightnings enlightened
the world the earth shook and trembled

7620 Thy way is in the sea and thy paths in many waters and thy
footsteps shall not be known

7621 Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep by the hand of Moses
and Aaron



Psalms Chapter 77


Attendite

Gods great benefits to the people of Israel notwithstanding their
ingratitude

771 Understanding for Asaph Attend O my people to my law incline
your ears to the words of my mouth

772 I will open my mouth in parables I will utter propositions from
the beginning

Propositions  Deep and mysterious sayings By this it appears that
the historical facts of ancient times commemorated in this psalm were
deep and mysterious as being figures of great truths appertaining to
the time of the New Testament

773 How great things have we heard and known and our fathers have
told us

774 They have not been hidden from their children in another
generation Declaring the praises of the Lord and his powers and his
wonders which he hath done

775 And he set up a testimony in Jacob and made a law in Israel How
great things he commanded our fathers that they should make the same
known to their children

776 That another generation might know them The children that should
be born and should rise up and declare them to their children

777 That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works
of God and may seek his commandments

778 That they may not become like their fathers a perverse and
exasperating generation A generation that set not their heart aright
and whose spirit was not faithful to God

779 The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow they have
turned back in the day of battle

7710 They kept not the covenant of God and in his law they would not
walk

7711 And they forgot his benefits and his wonders that he had shewn
them

7712 Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers in the
land of Egypt in the field of Tanis

7713 He divided the sea and brought them through and he made the
waters to stand as in a vessel

7714 And he conducted them with a cloud by day and all the night
with a light of fire

7715 He struck the rock in the wilderness and gave them to drink as
out of the great deep

7716 He brought forth water out of the rock and made streams run
down as rivers

7717 And they added yet more sin against him they provoked the most
High to wrath in the place without water

7718 And they tempted God in their hearts by asking meat for their
desires

7719 And they spoke ill of God they said Can God furnish a table in
the wilderness

7720 Because he struck the rock and the waters gushed out and the
streams overflowed Can he also give bread or provide a table for his
people

7721 Therefore the Lord heard and was angry and a fire was kindled
against Jacob and wrath came up against Israel

7722 Because they believed not in God and trusted not in his
salvation

7723 And he had commanded the clouds from above and had opened the
doors of heaven

7724 And had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given them
the bread of heaven

7725 Man ate the bread of angels he sent them provisions in
abundance

7726 He removed the south wind from heaven and by his power brought
in the southwest wind

7727 And he rained upon them flesh as dust and feathered fowls like
as the sand of the sea

7728 And they fell in the midst of their camp round about their
pavilions

7729 So they did eat and were filled exceedingly and he gave them
their desire

7730 they were not defrauded of that which they craved As yet their
meat was in their mouth

7731 And the wrath of God came upon them And he slew the fat ones
amongst them and brought down the chosen men of Israel

7732 In all these things they sinned still and they behaved not for
his wondrous works

7733 And their days were consumed in vanity and their years in
haste

7734 When he slew them then they sought him and they returned and
came to him early in the morning

7735 And they remembered that God was their helper and the most high
God their redeemer

7736 And they loved him with their mouth and with their tongue they
lied unto him

7737 But their heart was not right with him nor were they counted
faithful in his covenant

7738 But he is merciful and will forgive their sins and will not
destroy them And many a time did he turn away his anger and did not
kindle all his wrath

7739 And he remembered that they are flesh a wind that goeth and
returneth not

7740 How often did they provoke him in the desert and move him to
wrath in the place without water

7741 And they turned back and tempted God and grieved the holy one
of Israel

7742 They remembered not his hand in the day that he redeemed them
from the hand of him that afflicted them

7743 How he wrought his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field
of Tanis

7744 And he turned their rivers into blood and their showers that
they might not drink

7745 He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies which devoured them
and frogs which destroyed them

7746 And he gave up their fruits to the blast and their labours to
the locust

7747 And he destroyed their vineyards with hail and their mulberry
trees with hoarfrost

7748 And he gave up their cattle to the hail and their stock to the
fire

7749 And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation indignation
and wrath and trouble which he sent by evil angels

7750 He made a way for a path to his anger he spared not their souls
from death and their cattle he shut up in death

7751 And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt the
firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham

7752 And he took away his own people as sheep and guided them in the
wilderness like a flock

7753 And he brought them out in hope and they feared not and the sea
overwhelmed their enemies

7754 And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary the
mountain which his right hand had purchased And he cast out the
Gentiles before them and by lot divided to them their land by a line
of distribution

7755 And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles

7756 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God and they kept
not his testimonies

7757 And they turned away and kept not the covenant even like their
fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow

7758 They provoked him to anger on their hills and moved him to
jealousy with their graven things

7759 God heard and despised them and he reduced Israel exceedingly
as it were to nothing

7760 And he put away the tabernacle of Silo his tabernacle where he
dwelt among men

7761 And he delivered their strength into captivity and their beauty
into the hands of the enemy

7762 And he shut up his people under the sword and he despised his
inheritance

7763 Fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not
lamented

7764 Their priests fell by the sword and their widows did not mourn

7765 And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty
man that hath been surfeited with wine

7766 And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts he put them to an
everlasting reproach

7767 And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph and chose not the
tribe of Ephraim

7768 But he chose the tribe of Juda mount Sion which he loved

7769 And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns in the land which he
founded for ever

As of unicorns  That is firm and strong like the horn of the
unicorn This is one of the chiefest of the propositions of this psalm
foreshewing the firm establishment of the one true and everlasting
sanctuary of God in his church

7770 And he chose his servant David and took him from the flocks of
sheep he brought him from following the ewes great with young

7771 To feed Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance

7772 And he fed them in the innocence of his heart and conducted
them by the skilfulness of his hands



Psalms Chapter 78


Deus venerunt gentes

The church in time of persecution prayeth for relief It seems to
belong to the time of the Machabees

781 A psalm for Asaph O God the heathens are come into thy
inheritance they have defiled thy holy temple they have made
Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit

782 They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for
the fowls of the air the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the
earth

783 They have poured out their blood as water round about Jerusalem
and there was none to bury them

784 We are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision
to them that are round about us

785 How long O Lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy zeal be
kindled like a fire

786 Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee and
upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name

787 Because they have devoured Jacob and have laid waste his place

788 Remember not our former iniquities let thy mercies speedily
prevent us for we are become exceeding poor

789 Help us O God our saviour and for the glory of thy name O
Lord deliver us and forgive us our sins for thy names sake

7810 Lest they should say among the Gentiles Where is their God And
let him be made known among the nations before our eyes By the
revenging the blood of thy servants which hath been shed

7811 Let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee According
to the greatness of thy arm take possession of the children of them
that have been put to death

7812 And render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom the
reproach wherewith they have reproached thee O Lord

7813 But we thy people and the sheep of thy pasture will give
thanks to thee for ever We will shew forth thy praise unto generation
and generation



Psalms Chapter 79


Qui regis Israel

A prayer for the church in tribulation commemorating Gods former
favours

791 Unto the end for them that shall be changed a testimony for
Asaph a psalm

792 Give ear O thou that rulest Israel thou that leadest Joseph
like a sheep Thou that sittest upon the cherubims shine forth

793 Before Ephraim Benjamin and Manasses Stir up thy might and
come to save us

794 Convert us O God and shew us thy face and we shall be saved

795 O Lord God of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the
prayer of thy servant

796 How long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears and give us
for our drink tears in measure

797 Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours and
our enemies have scoffed at us

798 O God of hosts convert us and shew thy face and we shall be
saved

799 Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt thou hast cast out the
Gentiles and planted it

7910 Thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight thou plantedst
the roots thereof and it filled the land

7911 The shadow of it covered the hills and the branches thereof the
cedars of God

7912 It stretched forth its branches unto the sea and its boughs
unto the river

7913 Why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof so that all they
who pass by the way do pluck it

7914 The boar out of the wood hath laid it waste and a singular wild
beast hath devoured it

7915 Turn again O God of hosts look down from heaven and see and
visit this vineyard

7916 And perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted and upon
the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself

7917 Things set on fire and dug down shall perish at the rebuke of
thy countenance

Things set on fire etc  So this vineyard of thine almost consumed
already must perish if thou continue thy rebukes

7918 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand and upon the son
of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself

The man of thy right hand  Christ

7919 And we depart not from thee thou shalt quicken us and we will
call upon thy name

7920 O Lord God of hosts convert us and shew thy face and we shall
be saved



Psalms Chapter 80


Exultate Deo

An invitation to a solemn praising of God

801 Unto the end for the winepresses a psalm for Asaph himself

For the winepresses etc  Torcularibus It either signifies a musical
instrument or that this psalm was to be sung at the feast of the
tabernacles after the gathering in of the vintage

802 Rejoice to God our helper sing aloud to the God of Jacob

803 Take a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant psaltery
with the harp

804 Blow up the trumpet on the new moon on the noted day of your
solemnity

805 For it is a commandment in Israel and a judgment to the God of
Jacob

806 He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph when he came out of the
land of Egypt he heard a tongue which he knew not

807 He removed his back from the burdens his hands had served in
baskets

808 Thou calledst upon me in affliction and I delivered thee I
heard thee in the secret place of tempest I proved thee at the waters
of contradiction

In the secret place of tempest  Heb Of thunder When thou soughtest
to hide thyself from the tempest or when I came down to mount Sina
hidden from thy eyes in a storm of thunder

809 Hear O my people and I will testify to thee O Israel if thou
wilt hearken to me

8010 there shall be no new god in thee neither shalt
thou adore a strange god

8011 For I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of
Egypt open thy mouth wide and I will fill it

8012 But my people heard not my voice and Israel hearkened not to
me

8013 So I let them go according to the desires of their heart they
shall walk in their own inventions

8014 If my people had heard me if Israel had walked in my ways

8015 I should soon have humbled their enemies and laid my hand on
them that troubled them

8016 The enemies of the Lord have lied to him and their time shall
be for ever

Their time shall be forever  Impenitent sinners shall suffer for
ever

8017 And he fed them with the fat of wheat and filled them with
honey out of the rock



Psalms Chapter 81


Deus stetit

An exhortation to judges and men in power

811 A psalm for Asaph God hath stood in the congregation of gods
and being in the midst of them he judgeth gods

812 How long will you judge unjustly and accept the persons of the
wicked

813 Judge for the needy and fatherless do justice to the humble and
the poor

814 Rescue the poor and deliver the needy out of the hand of the
sinner

815 They have not known nor understood they walk on in darkness all
the foundations of the earth shall be moved

816 I have said You are gods and all of you the sons of the most
High

817 But you like men shall die and shall fall like one of the
princes

818 Arise O God judge thou the earth for thou shalt inherit among
all the nations



Psalms Chapter 82


Deus quis similis

A prayer against the enemies of Gods church

821 A canticle of a psalm for Asaph

822 O God who shall be like to thee hold not thy peace neither be
thou still O God

823 For lo thy enemies have made a noise and they that hate thee
have lifted up the head

824 They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people and have
consulted against thy saints

825 They have said Come and let us destroy them so that they be not
a nation and let the name of Israel be remembered no more

826 For they have contrived with one consent they have made a
covenant together against thee

827 The tabernacle of the Edomites and the Ishmahelites Moab and
the Agarens

828 Gebal and Ammon and Amalec the Philistines with the
inhabitants of Tyre

829 Yea and the Assyrian also is joined with them they are come to
the aid of the sons of Lot

8210 Do to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara as to Jabin at
the brook of Cisson

8211 Who perished at Endor and became as dung for the earth

8212 Make their princes like Oreb and Zeb and Zebee and Salmana
All their princes

8213 Who have said Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an
inheritance

8214 O my God make them like a wheel and as stubble before the
wind

8215 As fire which burneth the wood and as a flame burning
mountains

8216 So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest and shalt trouble
them in thy wrath

8217 Fill their faces with shame and they shall seek thy name O
Lord

8218 Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever and let them
be confounded and perish

8219 And let them know that the Lord is thy name thou alone art the
most High over all the earth

Quam dilecta

The soul aspireth after heaven rejoicing in the mean time in being in
the communion of Gods church upon earth

831 Unto the end for the winepresses a psalm for the sons of Core

832 How lovely are thy tabernacles O Lord of hosts

833 my soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord My heart
and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God

834 For the sparrow hath found herself a house and the turtle a nest
for herself where she may lay her young ones Thy altars O Lord of
hosts my king and my God

835 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house O Lord they shall
praise thee for ever and ever

836 Blessed is the man whose help is from thee in his heart he hath
disposed to ascend by steps

In his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps etc  Ascensiones in
corde suo disposuit As by steps men ascended to the temple of God
situated on a hill so the good Christian ascends towards the eternal
temple by certain steps of virtue disposed or ordered within the heart
and this whilst he lives as yet in the body in this vale of tears the
place which man hath set that is which he hath brought himself to
being cast out of paradise for his sin

837 In the vale of tears in the place which he hath set

838 For the lawgiver shall give a blessing they shall go from virtue
to virtue the God of gods shall be seen in Sion

839 O Lord God of hosts hear my prayer give ear O God of Jacob

8310 Behold O God our protector and look on the face of thy Christ

8311 For better is one day in thy courts above thousands I have
chosen to be an abject in the house of my God rather than to dwell in
the tabernacles of sinners

8312 For God loveth mercy and truth the Lord will give grace and
glory

8313 He will not deprive of good things them that walk in innocence
O Lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee

all their sins

844 Thou hast mitigated all thy anger thou hast turned away from the
wrath of thy indignation

845 Convert us O God our saviour and turn off thy anger from us

wrath from generation to generation

rejoice in thee

848 Shew us O Lord thy mercy and grant us thy salvation

peace unto his people And unto his saints and unto them that are
converted to the heart

may dwell in our land

fruit

way

Fundamenta ejus

The glory of the church of Christ

861 For the sons of Core a psalm of a canticle The foundations
thereof are the holy mountains

The holy mountains  The apostles and prophets Eph 220

862 The Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles of
Jacob

863 Glorious things are said of thee O city of God

864 I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me Behold the
foreigners and Tyre and the people of the Ethiopians these were
there

Rahab  Egypt etc To this Sion which is the church of God many
shall resort from all nations

865 Shall not Sion say This man and that man is born in her and the
Highest himself hath founded her

Shall not Sion say etc  The meaning is that Sion viz the church
shall not only be able to commemorate this or that particular person of
renown born in her but also to glory in great multitudes of people and
princes of her communion who have been foretold in the writings of the
prophets and registered in the writings of the apostles

866 The Lord shall tell in his writings of peoples and of princes of
them that have been in her

867 The dwelling in thee is as it were of all rejoicing

Maheleth to answer understanding of Eman the Ezrahite

petition

874 For my soul is filled with evils and my life hath drawn nigh to
hell

875 I am counted among them that go down to the pit I am become as a
man without help

876 Free among the dead Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres
whom thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand

877 They have laid me in the lower pit in the dark places and in
the shadow of death

878 Thy wrath is strong over me and all thy waves thou hast brought
in upon me

an abomination to themselves I was delivered up and came not forth

8710 My eyes languished through poverty All the day I cried to thee

8711 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead or shall physicians raise to
life and give praise to thee

8712 Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy and thy truth
in destruction

8713 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy justice in the
land of forgetfulness

8714 But I O Lord have cried to thee and in the morning my prayer
shall prevent thee

8715 Lord why castest thou off my prayer why turnest thou away thy
face from me

8716 I am poor and in labours from my youth and being exalted have
been humbled and troubled

8717 Thy wrath hath come upon me and thy terrors have troubled me

8718 They have come round about me like water all the day they have
compassed me about together

8719 Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me and my
acquaintance because of misery



Psalms Chapter 88


Misericordias Domini

The perpetuity of the church of Christ in consequence of the promise
of God which notwithstanding God permits her to suffer sometimes
most grievous afflictions

881 Of understanding for Ethan the Ezrahite

882 The mercies of the Lord I will sing for ever I will shew forth
thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation

883 For thou hast said Mercy shall be built up for ever in the
heavens thy truth shall be prepared in them

884 I have made a covenant with my elect I have sworn to David my
servant

885 Thy seed will I settle for ever And I will build up thy throne
unto generation and generation

886 The heavens shall confess thy wonders O Lord and thy truth in
the church of the saints

887 For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord or who among
the sons of God shall be like to God

888 God who is glorified in the assembly of the saints great and
terrible above all them that are about him

889 O Lord God of hosts who is like to thee thou art mighty O
Lord and thy truth is round about thee

8810 Thou rulest the power of the sea and appeasest the motion of
the waves thereof

8811 Thou hast humbled the proud one as one that is slain with the
arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies

8812 Thine are the heavens and thine is the earth the world and the
fulness thereof thou hast founded

8813 The north and the sea thou hast created Thabor and Hermon shall
rejoice in thy name

8814 Thy arm is with might Let thy hand be strengthened and thy
right hand exalted

8815 Justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne Mercy
and truth shall go before thy face

8816 Blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation They shall walk
O Lord in the light of thy countenance

8817 And in thy name they shall rejoice all the day and in thy
justice they shall be exalted

8818 For thou art the glory of their strength and in thy good
pleasure shall our horn be exalted

8819 For our protection is of the Lord and of our king the holy one
of Israel

8820 Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints and saidst I have
laid help upon one that is mighty and have exalted one chosen out of
my people

8821 I have found David my servant with my holy oil I have anointed
him

8822 For my hand shall help him and my arm shall strengthen him

8823 The enemy shall have no advantage over him nor the son of
iniquity have power to hurt him

8824 And I will cut down his enemies before his face and them that
hate him I will put to flight

8825 And my truth and my mercy shall be with him and in my name
shall his horn be exalted

8826 And I will set his hand in the sea and his right hand in the
rivers

8827 He shall cry out to me Thou art my father my God and the
support of my salvation

8828 And I will make him my firstborn high above the kings of the
earth

8829 I will keep my mercy for him for ever and my covenant faithful
to him

8830 And I will make his seed to endure for evermore and his throne
as the days of heaven

8831 And if his children forsake my law and walk not in my
judgments

8832 If they profane my justices and keep not my commandments

8833 I will visit their iniquities with a rod and their sins with
stripes

8834 But my mercy I will not take away from him nor will I suffer my
truth to fail

8835 Neither will I profane my covenant and the words that proceed
from my mouth I will not make void

8836 Once have I sworn by my holiness I will not lie unto David

8837 His seed shall endure for ever

8838 And his throne as the sun before me and as the moon perfect for
ever and a faithful witness in heaven

8839 But thou hast rejected and despised thou hast been angry with
my anointed

8840 Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant thou hast
profaned his sanctuary on the earth

Overthrown the covenant etc  All this seems to relate to the time of
the captivity of Babylon in which for the sins of the people and
their princes God seemed to have set aside for a while the covenant he
made with David

8841 Thou hast broken down all his hedges thou hast made his
strength fear

8842 All that pass by the way have robbed him he is become a
reproach to his neighbours

8843 Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him thou
hast made all his enemies to rejoice

8844 Thou hast turned away the help of his sword and hast not
assisted him in battle

8845 Thou hast made his purification to cease and thou hast cast his
throne down to the ground

8846 Thou hast shortened the days of his time thou hast covered him
with confusion

8847 How long O Lord turnest thou away unto the end shall thy
anger burn like fire

8848 Remember what my substance is for hast thou made all the
children of men in vain

8849 Who is the man that shall live and not see death that shall
deliver his soul from the hand of hell

8850 Lord where are thy ancient mercies according to what thou
didst swear to David in thy truth

8851 Be mindful O Lord of the reproach of thy servants which I
have held in my bosom of many nations

8852 Wherewith thy enemies have reproached O Lord wherewith they
have reproached the change of thy anointed

8853 Blessed be the Lord for evermore So be it So be it



Psalms Chapter 89


Domine refugium

A prayer for the mercy of God recounting the shortness and miseries of
the days of man

891 A prayer of Moses the man of God Lord thou hast been our refuge
from generation to generation

892 Before the mountains were made or the earth and the world was
formed from eternity and to eternity thou art God

893 Turn not man away to be brought low and thou hast said Be
converted O ye sons of men

Turn not man away etc  Suffer him not quite to perish from thee
since thou art pleased to call upon him to be converted to thee

894 For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday which is
past And as a watch in the night

895 Things that are counted nothing shall their years be

896 In the morning man shall grow up like grass in the morning he
shall flourish and pass away in the evening he shall fall grow dry
and wither

897 For in thy wrath we have fainted away and are troubled in thy
indignation

898 Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes our life in the
light of thy countenance

899 For all our days are spent and in thy wrath we have fainted
away Our years shall be considered as a spider

As a spider  As frail and weak as a spiders web and miserable
withal whilst like a spider we spend our bowels in weaving webs to
catch flies

8910 The days of our years in them are threescore and ten years But
if in the strong they be fourscore years and what is more of them is
labour and sorrow For mildness is come upon us and we shall be
corrected

Mildness is come upon us etc  Gods mildness corrects us inasmuch
as he deals kindly with us in shortening the days of this miserable
life and so weaning our affections from all its transitory enjoyments
and teaching us true wisdom

8911 Who knoweth the power of thy anger and for thy fear

8912 Can number thy wrath So make thy right hand known and men
learned in heart in wisdom

8913 Return O Lord how long and be entreated in favour of thy
servants

8914 We are filled in the morning with thy mercy and we have
rejoiced and are delighted all our days

8915 We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us for
the years in which we have seen evils

8916 Look upon thy servants and upon their works and direct their
children

8917 And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us and
direct thou the works of our hands over us yea the work of our hands
do thou direct



Psalms Chapter 90


Qui habitat

The just is secure under the protection of God

901 The praise of a canticle for David He that dwelleth in the aid
of the most High shall abide under the protection of the God of Jacob

902 He shall say to the Lord Thou art my protector and my refuge
my God in him will I trust

903 For he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunters and from
the sharp word

904 He will overshadow thee with his shoulders and under his wings
thou shalt trust

905 His truth shall compass thee with a shield thou shalt not be
afraid of the terror of the night

906 Of the arrow that flieth in the day of the business that walketh
about in the dark of invasion or of the noonday devil

907 A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right
hand but it shall not come nigh thee

908 But thou shalt consider with thy eyes and shalt see the reward
of the wicked

909 Because thou O Lord art my hope thou hast made the most High
thy refuge

9010 There shall no evil come to thee nor shall the scourge come
near thy dwelling

9011 For he hath given his angels charge over thee to keep thee in
all thy ways

9012 In their hands they shall bear thee up lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone

9013 Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk and thou shalt
trample under foot the lion and the dragon

9014 Because he hoped in me I will deliver him I will protect him
because he hath known my name

9015 He shall cry to me and I will hear him I am with him in
tribulation I will deliver him and I will glorify him

9016 I will fill him with length of days and I will shew him my
salvation



Psalms Chapter 91


Bonum est confiteri

God is to be praised for his wondrous works

911 A psalm of a canticle on the sabbath day

912 It is good to give praise to the Lord and to sing to thy name O
most High

913 To shew forth thy mercy in the morning and thy truth in the
night

914 Upon an instrument of ten strings upon the psaltery with a
canticle upon the harp

915 For thou hast given me O Lord a delight in thy doings and in
the works of thy hands I shall rejoice

916 O Lord how great are thy works thy thoughts are exceeding deep

917 The senseless man shall not know nor will the fool understand
these things

918 When the wicked shall spring up as grass and all the workers of
iniquity shall appear That they may perish for ever and ever

919 But thou O Lord art most high for evermore

9110 For behold thy enemies O lord for behold thy enemies shall
perish and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered

9111 But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn and my
old age in plentiful mercy

9112 My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies and my ear shall
hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me

9113 The just shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow up
like the cedar of Libanus

9114 They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in
the courts of the house of our God

9115 They shall still increase in a fruitful old age and shall be
well treated

9116 That they may shew That the Lord our God is righteous and
there is no iniquity in him



Psalms Chapter 92


Dominus regnavit

The glory and stability of the kingdom that is of the church of
Christ

Praise in the way of a canticle for David himself on the day before
the sabbath when the earth was founded

921 The Lord hath reigned he is clothed with beauty the Lord is
clothed with strength and hath girded himself For he hath established
the world which shall not be moved

922 My throne is prepared from of old thou art from everlasting

923 The floods have lifted up O Lord the floods have lifted up
their voice The floods have lifted up their waves

924 With the noise of many waters Wonderful are the surges of the
sea wonderful is the Lord on high

925 Thy testimonies are become exceedingly credible holiness
becometh thy house O Lord unto length of days



Psalms Chapter 93


Deus ultionum

God shall judge and punish the oppressors of his people

A psalm for David himself on the fourth day of the week

931 The Lord is the God to whom revenge belongeth the God of revenge
hath acted freely

932 Lift up thyself thou that judgest the earth render a reward to
the proud

933 How long shall sinners O Lord how long shall sinners glory

934 Shall they utter and speak iniquity shall all speak who work
injustice

935 Thy people O Lord they have brought low and they have
afflicted thy inheritance

936 They have slain the widow and the stranger and they have
murdered the fatherless

937 And they have said The Lord shall not see neither shall the God
of Jacob understand

938 Understand ye senseless among the people and you fools be
wise at last

939 He that planted the ear shall he not hear or he that formed the
eye doth he not consider

9310 He that chastiseth nations shall he not rebuke he that
teacheth man knowledge

9311 The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men that they are vain

9312 Blessed is the man whom thou shalt instruct O Lord and shalt
teach him out of thy law

9313 That thou mayst give him rest from the evil days till a pit be
dug for the wicked

Rest from the evil days  That thou mayst mitigate the sorrows to
which he is exposed during the short and evil days of his mortality

9314 For the Lord will not cast off his people neither will he
forsake his own inheritance

9315 Until justice be turned into judgment and they that are near it
are all the upright in heart

Until justice be turned into judgment etc  By being put in
execution which will be agreeable to all the upright in heart

9316 Who shall rise up for me against the evildoers or who shall
stand with me against the workers of iniquity

9317 Unless the Lord had been my helper my soul had almost dwelt in
hell

9318 If I said My foot is moved thy mercy O Lord assisted me

9319 According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart thy
comforts have given joy to my soul

9320 Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee who framest labour in
commandment

Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee etc  That is wilt thou O
God who art always just admit of the seat of iniquity that is of
injustice or unjust judges to have any partnership with thee Thou
who framest or makest labour in commandment that is thou who
obligest us to labour with all diligence to keep thy commandments

9321 They will hunt after the soul of the just and will condemn
innocent blood

9322 But the Lord is my refuge and my God the help of my hope

9323 And he will render them their iniquity  and in their malice he
will destroy them the Lord our God will destroy them



Psalms Chapter 94

the mountains are his

945 For the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry
land

made us

and the sheep of his hand

948 To day if you shall hear his voice harden not your hearts

949 As in the provocation according to the day of temptation in the
wilderness where your fathers tempted me they proved me and saw my
works

9410 Forty years long was I offended with that generation and I
said These always err in heart

9411 And these men have not known my ways so I swore in my wrath
that they shall not enter into my rest

Clouds and darkness  The coming of Christ in the clouds with great
terror and majesty to judge the world is here prophesied

963 A fire shall go before him and shall burn his enemies round
about

964 His lightnings have shone forth to the world the earth saw and
trembled

965 The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord at
the presence of the Lord of all the earth

966 The heavens declared his justice and all people saw his glory

967 Let them be all confounded that adore graven things and that
glory in their idols Adore him all you his angels

Psalms Chapter 98


Dominus regnavit

The reign of the Lord in Sion that is of Christ in his church

981 A psalm for David himself The Lord hath reigned let the people
be angry he that sitteth on the cherubims let the earth be moved

Let the people be angry  Though many enemies rage and the whole
earth be stirred up to oppose the reign of Christ he shall still
prevail

982 The lord is great in Sion and high above all people

983 Let them give praise to thy great name for it is terrible and
holy

984 And the kings honour loveth judgment Thou hast prepared
directions thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob

Loveth judgment  Requireth discretionIbid Directions  Most
right and just laws to direct men

985 Exalt ye the Lord our God and adore his footstool for it is
holy

Adore his footstool  The ark of the covenant was called in the Old
Testament Gods footstool over which he was understood to sit on his
propitiatory or mercy seat as on a throne between the wings of the
cherubims in the sanctuary to which the children of Israel paid a
great veneration But as this psalm evidently relates to Christ and
the New Testament where the ark has no place the holy fathers
understand this text of the worship paid by the church to the body and
blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries inasmuch as the humanity of
Christ is as it were the footstool of the divinity So St Ambrose
L 3 De Spiritu Sancto c 12 And St Augustine upon this psalm

986 Moses and Aaron among his priests and Samuel among them that
call upon his name They called upon the Lord and he heard them

Moses and Aaron among his priests  By this it is evident that Moses
also was a priest and indeed the chief priest inasmuch as he
consecrated Aaron and offered sacrifice for him Lev 8 So that his
preeminence over Aaron makes nothing for lay church headship

987 He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud They kept his
testimonies and the commandment which he gave them

988 Thou didst hear them O Lord our God thou wast a merciful God to
them and taking vengeance on all their inventions

All their inventions  that is all the enterprises of their enemies
against them as in the case of Core Dathan and Abiron

989 Exalt ye the Lord our God and adore at his holy mountain for
the Lord our God is holy



Psalms Chapter 99


Jubilate Deo

All are invited to rejoice in God the creator of all

991 A psalm of praise

992 Sing joyfully to God all the earth serve ye the Lord with
gladness Come in before his presence with exceeding great joy

993 Know ye that the Lord he is God he made us and not we
ourselves We are his people and the sheep of his pasture

994 Go ye into his gates with praise into his courts with hymns and
give glory to him Praise ye his name

995 For the Lord is sweet his mercy endureth for ever and his truth
to generation and generation



Psalms Chapter 100


Misericordiam et judicium

The prophet exhorteth all by his example to follow mercy and justice

1001 A psalm for David himself Mercy and judgment I will sing to
thee O Lord I will sing

1002 And I will understand in the unspotted way when thou shalt come
to me I walked in the innocence of my heart in the midst of my house

I will understand etc  That is I will apply my mind I will do my
endeavour to know and to follow the perfect way of thy commandments
not trusting to my own strength but relying on thy coming to me by thy
grace

1003 I will not set before my eyes any unjust thing I hated the
workers of iniquities

1004 The perverse heart did not cleave to me and the malignant that
turned aside from me I would not know

1005 The man that in private detracted his neighbour him did I
persecute With him that had a proud eye and an unsatiable heart I
would not eat

1006 My eyes were upon the faithful of the earth to sit with me the
man that walked in the perfect way he served me

1007 He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house
he that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes

1008 In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land that I
might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord



Psalms Chapter 101


Domine exaudi

A prayer for one in affliction the fifth penitential psalm

1011 The prayer of the poor man when he was anxious and poured out
his supplication before the Lord

1012 Hear O Lord my prayer and let my cry come to thee

1013 Turn not away thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble
incline thy ear to me In what day soever I shall call upon thee hear
me speedily

1014 For my days are vanished like smoke and my bones are grown dry
like fuel for the fire

1015 I am smitten as grass and my heart is withered because I
forgot to eat my bread

1016 Through the voice of my groaning my bone hath cleaved to my
flesh

1017 I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness I am like a
night raven in the house

A pelican etc  I am become through grief like birds that affect
solitude and darkness

1018 I have watched and am become as a sparrow all alone on the
housetop

1019 All the day long my enemies reproached me and they that praised
me did swear against me

10110 For I did eat ashes like bread and mingled my drink with
weeping

10111 Because of thy anger and indignation for having lifted me up
thou hast thrown me down

10112 My days have declined like a shadow and I am withered like
grass

10113 But thou O Lord endurest for ever and thy memorial to all
generations

10114 Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion for it is time to have
mercy on it for the time is come

10115 For the stones thereof have pleased thy servants and they
shall have pity on the earth thereof

10116 All the Gentiles shall fear thy name O Lord and all the kings
of the earth thy glory

10117 For the Lord hath built up Sion and he shall be seen in his
glory

10118 He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble and he hath not
despised their petition

10119 Let these things be written unto another generation and the
people that shall be created shall praise the Lord

10120 Because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary from
heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth

10121 That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters that
he might release the children of the slain

10122 That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion and his
praise in Jerusalem

10123 When the people assemble together and kings to serve the
Lord

10124 He answered him in the way of his strength Declare unto me the
fewness of my days

He answered him in the way of his strength  That is the people
mentioned in the foregoing verse or the penitent in whose person this
psalm is delivered answered the Lord in the way of his strength that
is according to the best of his power and strength or when he was in
the flower of his age and strength inquiring after the fewness of his
days to know if he should live long enough to see the happy
restoration of Sion etc

10125 Call me not away in the midst of my days thy years are unto
generation and generation

10126 In the beginning O Lord thou foundedst the earth and the
heavens are the works of thy hands

10127 They shall perish but thou remainest and all of them shall
grow old like a garment And as a vesture thou shalt change them and
they shall be changed

10128 But thou art always the selfsame and thy years shall not fail

10129 The children of thy servants shall continue and their seed
shall be directed for ever



Psalms Chapter 102


Benedic anima

Thanksgiving to God for his mercies

1021 For David himself Bless the Lord O my soul and let all that
is within me bless his holy name

1022 Bless the Lord O my soul and never forget all he hath done for
thee

1023 Who forgiveth all thy iniquities who healeth all thy diseases

1024 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with
mercy and compassion

1025 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things thy youth shall be
renewed like the eagles

1026 The Lord doth mercies and judgment for all that suffer wrong

1027 He hath made his ways known to Moses his wills to the children
of Israel

1028 The Lord is compassionate and merciful longsuffering and
plenteous in mercy

1029 He will not always be angry nor will he threaten for ever

10210 He hath not dealt with us according to our sins nor rewarded
us according to our iniquities

10211 For according to the height of the heaven above the earth he
hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him

10212 As far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our
iniquities from us

10213 As a father hath compassion on his children so hath the Lord
compassion on them that fear him

10214 For he knoweth our frame He remembereth that we are dust

10215 Mans days are as grass as the flower of the field so shall he
flourish

10216 For the spirit shall pass in him and he shall not be and he
shall know his place no more

10217 But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity and unto eternity
upon them that fear him And his justice unto childrens children

10218 To such as keep his covenant And are mindful of his
commandments to do them

10219 The lord hath prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom
shall rule over all

10220 Bless the Lord all ye his angels you that are mighty in
strength and execute his word hearkening to the voice of his orders

10221 Bless the Lord all ye his hosts you ministers of his that do
his will

10222 Bless the Lord all his works in every place of his dominion
O my soul bless thou the Lord

God is to be praised for his mighty works and wonderful providence

1031 For David himself Bless the Lord O my soul O Lord my God
thou art exceedingly great Thou hast put on praise and beauty

1032 And art clothed with light as with a garment Who stretchest out
the heaven like a pavilion

1033 Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water Who makest the
clouds thy chariot who walkest upon the wings of the winds

1034 Who makest thy angels spirits and thy ministers a burning fire

1035 Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases it shall not be
moved for ever and ever

1036 The deep like a garment is its clothing above the mountains
shall the waters stand

1037 At thy rebuke they shall flee at the voice of thy thunder they
shall fear

1038 The mountains ascend and the plains descend into the place
which thou hast founded for them

1039 Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over neither
shall they return to cover the earth

10310 Thou sendest forth springs in the vales between the midst of
the hills the waters shall pass

10311 All the beasts of the field shall drink the wild asses shall
expect in their thirst

10312 Over them the birds of the air shall dwell from the midst of
the rocks they shall give forth their voices

10313 Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms the earth shall
be filled with the fruit of thy works

10314 Bringing forth grass for cattle and herb for the service of
men That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth

10315 And that wine may cheer the heart of man That he may make the
face cheerful with oil and that bread may strengthen mans heart

10316 The trees of the field shall be filled and the cedars of
Libanus which he hath planted

10317 There the sparrows shall make their nests The highest of them
is the house of the heron

10318 The high hills are a refuge for the harts the rock for the
irchins

10319 He hath made the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going
down

10320 Thou hast appointed darkness and it is night in it shall all
the beasts of the woods go about

10321 The young lions roaring after their prey and seeking their
meat from God

10322 The sun ariseth and they are gathered together and they shall
lie down in their dens

10323 Man shall go forth to his work and to his labour until the
evening

10324 How great are thy works O Lord  thou hast made all things in
wisdom the earth is filled with thy riches

10325 So is this great sea which stretcheth wide its arms there are
creeping things without number Creatures little and great

10326 There the ships shall go This sea dragon which thou hast
formed to play therein

10327 All expect of thee that thou give them food in season

10328 What thou givest to them they shall gather up when thou
openest thy hand they shall all be filled with good

10329 But if thou turnest away thy face they shall be troubled thou
shalt take away their breath and they shall fail and shall return to
their dust

10330 Thou shalt send forth thy spirit and they shall be created
and thou shalt renew the face of the earth

10331 May the glory of the Lord endure for ever the Lord shall
rejoice in his works

10332 He looketh upon the earth and maketh it tremble he troubleth
the mountains and they smoke

10333 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live I will sing praise
to my God while I have my being

10334 Let my speech be acceptable to him but I will take delight in
the Lord

10335 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth and the unjust so
that they be no more O my soul bless thou the Lord



Psalms Chapter 104


Confitemini Domino

A thanksgiving to God for his benefits to his people Israel

Alleluia

1041 Give glory to the Lord and call upon his name declare his
deeds among the Gentiles

1042 Sing to him yea sing praises to him relate all his wondrous
works

1043 Glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the Lord

1044 Seek ye the lord and be strengthened seek his face evermore

1045 Remember his marvellous works which he hath done his wonders
and the judgments of his mouth

1046 O ye seed of Abraham his servant ye sons of Jacob his chosen

1047 He is the Lord our God his judgments are in all the earth

1048 He hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations

1049 Which he made to Abraham and his oath to Isaac

10410 And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law and to Israel for
an everlasting testament

10411 Saying To thee will I give the land of Chanaan the lot of
your inheritance

10412 When they were but a small number yea very few and sojourners
therein

10413 And they passed from nation to nation and from one kingdom to
another people

10414 He suffered no man to hurt them and he reproved kings for
their sakes

10415 Touch ye not my anointed and do no evil to my prophets

10416 And he called a famine upon the land and he broke in pieces
all the support of bread

10417 He sent a man before them Joseph who was sold for a slave

10418 They humbled his feet in fetters the iron pierced his soul

10419 Until his word came The word of the Lord inflamed him

10420 The king sent and he released him the ruler of the people
and he set him at liberty

10421 He made him master of his house and ruler of all his
possession

10422 That he might instruct his princes as himself and teach his
ancients wisdom

10423 And Israel went into Egypt and Jacob was a sojourner in the
land of Cham

10424 And he increased his people exceedingly and strengthened them
over their enemies

10425 He turned their heart to hate his people and to deal
deceitfully with his servants

He turned their heart etc  Not that God who is never the author of
sin moved the Egyptians to hate and persecute his people but that the
Egyptians took occasion of hating and envying them from the sight of
the benefits which God bestowed upon them

10426 He sent Moses his servant Aaron the man whom he had chosen

10427 He gave them power to shew them signs and his wonders in the
land of Cham

10428 He sent darkness and made it obscure and grieved not his
words

Grieved not his words  That is he was not wanting to fulfil his
words or he did not grieve Moses and Aaron the carriers of his words
or he did not grieve his words that is his sons the children of
Israel who enjoyed light whilst the Egyptians were oppressed with
darkness

10429 He turned their waters into blood and destroyed their fish

10430 Their land brought forth frogs in the inner chambers of their
kings

10431 He spoke and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in
all their coasts

Sciniphs  See the annotation Ex816

10432 He gave them hail for rain a burning fire in the land

10433 And he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees and he
broke in pieces the trees of their coasts

10434 He spoke and the locust came and the bruchus of which there
was no number

Bruchus  An insect of the locust kind

10435 And they devoured all the grass in their land and consumed all
the fruit of their ground

10436 And he slew all the firstborn in their land the firstfruits of
all their labour

10437 And he brought them out with silver and gold and there was not
among their tribes one that was feeble

10438 Egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them lay
upon them

10439 He spread a cloud for their protection and fire to give them
light in the night

10440 They asked and the quail came and he filled them with the
bread of heaven

10441 He opened the rock and waters flowed rivers ran down in the
dry land

10442 Because he remembered his holy word which he had spoken to his
servant Abraham

10443 And he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with
gladness

10444 And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles and they possessed
the labours of the people

10445 That they might observe his justifications and seek after his
law

His justifications  That is his commandments which here and in
many other places of the scripture are called justifications because
the keeping of them makes man just The Protestants render it by the
word statutes in favour of their doctrine which does not allow good
works to justify



Psalms Chapter 105


Confitemini Domino

A confession of the manifold sins and ingratitudes of the Israelites

Alleluia

1051 Give glory to the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth
for ever

1052 Who shall declare the powers of the Lord who shall set forth
all his praises

1053 Blessed are they that keep judgment and do justice at all
times

1054 Remember us O Lord in the favour of thy people visit us with
thy salvation

1055 That we may see the good of thy chosen that we may rejoice in
the joy of thy nation that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance

1056 We have sinned with our fathers we have acted unjustly we have
wrought iniquity

1057 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies And they provoked to wrath going up
to the sea even the Red Sea

1058 And he saved them for his own names sake that he might make
his power known

1059 And he rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up and he led them
through the depths as in a wilderness

10510 And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them and he
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy

10511 And the water covered them that afflicted them there was not
one of them left

10512 And they believed his words and they sang his praises

10513 They had quickly done they forgot his works and they waited
not for his counsel

10514 And they coveted their desire in the desert and they tempted
God in the place without water

10515 And he gave them their request and sent fulness into their
souls

10516 And they provoked Moses in the camp Aaron the holy one of the
Lord

10517 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
congregation of Abiron

10518 And a fire was kindled in their congregation the flame burned
the wicked

10519 They made also a calf in Horeb and they adored the graven
thing

10520 And they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that
eateth grass

10521 They forgot God who saved them who had done great things in
Egypt

10522 Wondrous works in the land of Cham terrible things in the Red
Sea

10523 And he said that he would destroy them had not Moses his
chosen stood before him in the breach To turn away his wrath lest he
should destroy them

10524 And they set at nought the desirable land They believed not
his word

10525 And they murmured in their tents they hearkened not to the
voice of the Lord

10526 And he lifted up his hand over them to overthrow them in the
desert

10527 And to cast down their seed among the nations and to scatter
them in the countries

10528 They also were initiated to Beelphegor and ate the sacrifices
of the dead

Initiated  That is they dedicated or consecrated themselves to the
idol of the Moabites and Madianites called Beelphegor or BaalPeor
Num 253Ibid The dead  Viz idols without life

10529 And they provoked him with their inventions and destruction
was multiplied among them

10530 Then Phinees stood up and pacified him and the slaughter
ceased

10531 And it was reputed to him unto justice to generation and
generation for evermore

10532 They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction and
Moses was afflicted for their sakes

10533 Because they exasperated his spirit And he distinguished with
his lips

He distinguished with his lips  Moses by occasion of the peoples
rebellion and incredulity was guilty of distinguishing with his lips
when instead of speaking to the rock as God had commanded he said to
the people with a certain hesitation in his faith Hear ye rebellious
and incredulous Can we from this rock bring out water for you Num
2010

10534 They did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto
them

10535 And they were mingled among the heathens and learned their
works

10536 And served their idols and it became a stumblingblock to them

10537 And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils

10538 And they shed innocent blood the blood of their sons and of
their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan And the
land was polluted with blood

10539 And was defiled with their works and they went aside after
their own inventions

10540 And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people and he
abhorred his inheritance

10541 And he delivered them into the hands of the nations and they
that hated them had dominion over them

10542 And their enemies afflicted them and they were humbled under
their hands

10543 Many times did he deliver them But they provoked him with
their counsel and they were brought low by their iniquities

10544 And he saw when they were in tribulation and he heard their
prayer

10545 And he was mindful of his covenant and repented according to
the multitude of his mercies

10546 And he gave them unto mercies in the sight of all those that
had made them captives

10547 Save us O Lord our God and gather us from among the nations
That we may give thanks to thy holy name and may glory in thy praise

10548 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from everlasting to
everlasting and let all the people say So be it so be it



Psalms Chapter 106


Confitemini Domino

All are invited to give thanks to God for his perpetual providence over
men

Alleluia

1061 Give glory to the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth
for ever

1062 Let them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord whom he
hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gathered out of the
countries

1063 From the rising and from the setting of the sun from the north
and from the sea

1064 They wandered in a wilderness in a place without water they
found not the way of a city for their habitation

1065 They were hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them

1066 And they cried to the Lord in their tribulation and he
delivered them out of their distresses

1067 And he led them into the right way that they might go to a city
of habitation

1068 Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him and his wonderful
works to the children of men

1069 For he hath satisfied the empty soul and hath filled the hungry
soul with good things

10610 Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death bound in
want and in iron

10611 Because they had exasperated the words of God and provoked the
counsel of the most High

10612 And their heart was humbled with labours they were weakened
and there was none to help them

10613 Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction and he
delivered them out of their distresses

10614 And he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death
and broke their bonds in sunder

10615 Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him and his
wonderful works to the children of men

10616 Because he hath broken gates of brass and burst iron bars

10617 He took them out of the way of their iniquity for they were
brought low for their injustices

10618 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat and they drew nigh even
to the gates of death

10619 And they cried to the Lord in their affliction and he
delivered them out of their distresses

10620 He sent his word and healed them and delivered them from
their destructions

10621 Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him and his
wonderful works to the children of men

10622 And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise and declare his
works with joy

10623 They that go down to the sea in ships doing business in the
great waters

10624 These have seen the works of the Lord and his wonders in the
deep

10625 He said the word and there arose a storm of wind and the
waves thereof were lifted up

10626 They mount up to the heavens and they go down to the depths
their soul pined away with evils

10627 They were troubled and reeled like a drunken man and all
their wisdom was swallowed up

10628 And they cried to the Lord in their affliction and he brought
them out of their distresses

10629 And he turned the storm into a breeze and its waves were
still

10630 And they rejoiced because they were still and he brought them
to the haven which they wished for

10631 Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him and his
wonderful works to the children of men

10632 And let them exalt him in the church of the people and praise
him in the chair of the ancients

10633 He hath turned rivers into a wilderness and the sources of
waters into dry ground

10634 A fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein

10635 He hath turned a wilderness into pools of waters and a dry
land into water springs

10636 And hath placed there the hungry and they made a city for
their habitation

10637 Anti they sowed fields and planted vineyards and they yielded
fruit of birth

10638 And he blessed them and they were multiplied exceedingly and
their cattle he suffered not to decrease

10639 Then they were brought to be few and they were afflicted
through the trouble of evils and sorrow

10640 Contempt was poured forth upon their princes and he caused
them to wander where there was no passing and out of the way

10641 And he helped the poor out of poverty and made him families
like a flock of sheep

10642 The just shall see and shall rejoice and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth

10643 Who is wise and will keep these things and will understand
the mercies of the Lord



Psalms Chapter 107


Paratum cor meum

The prophet praiseth God for benefits received

1071 A canticle of a psalm for David himself

1072 My heart is ready O God my heart is ready I will sing and
will give praise with my glory

1073 Arise my glory arise psaltery and harp I will arise in the
morning early

1074 I will praise thee O Lord among the people and I will sing
unto thee among the nations

1075 For thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth even
unto the clouds

1076 Be thou exalted O God above the heavens and thy glory over
all the earth

1077 That thy beloved may be delivered Save with thy right hand and
hear me

1078 God hath spoken in his holiness I will rejoice and I will
divide Sichem and I will mete out the vale of tabernacles

1079 Galaad is mine and Manasses is mine and Ephraim the protection
of my head Juda is my king

10710 Moab the pot of my hope Over Edom I will stretch out my shoe
the aliens are become my friends

10711 Who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into
Edom

10712 Wilt not thou O God who hast cast us off  and wilt not thou
O God go forth with our armies

10713 O grant us help from trouble for vain is the help of man

10714 Through God we shall do mightily and he will bring our enemies
to nothing



Psalms Chapter 108


Deus laudem meam

David in the person of Christ prayeth against his persecutors more
especially the traitor Judas foretelling and approving his just
punishment for his obstinacy in sin and final impenitence

1081 Unto the end a psalm for David

1082 O God be not thou silent in my praise for the mouth of the
wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me

1083 They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues and they
have compassed me about with words of hatred and have fought against
me without cause

1084 Instead of making me a return of love they detracted me but I
gave myself to prayer

1085 And they repaid me evil for good and hatred for my love

1086 Set thou the sinner over him and may the devil stand at his
right hand

Set thou the sinner over him etc  Give to the devil that
archsinner power over him let him enter into him and possess him
The imprecations contained in the thirty verses of this psalm are
opposed to the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our
Lord and are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that
should befall the traitor and his accomplices the Jews and not
properly as curses

1087 When he is judged may he go out condemned and may his prayer
be turned to sin

1088 May his days be few and his bishopric let another take

1089 May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow

10810 Let his children be carried about vagabonds and beg and let
them be cast out of their dwellings

10811 May the usurer search all his substance and let strangers
plunder his labours

10812 May there be none to help him nor none to pity his fatherless
offspring

10813 May his posterity be cut off in one generation may his name be
blotted out

10814 May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of
the Lord and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out

10815 May they be before the Lord continually and let the memory of
them perish from the earth

10816 because he remembered not to shew mercy

10817 But persecuted the poor man and the beggar and the broken in
heart to put him to death

10818 And he loved cursing and it shall come unto him and he would
not have blessing and it shall be far from him And he put on cursing
like a garment and it went in like water into his entrails and like
oil in his bones

10819 May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him and like
a girdle with which he is girded continually

10820 This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord and
who speak evils against my soul

10821 But thou O Lord do with me for thy names sake because thy
mercy is sweet Do thou deliver me

10822 For I am poor and needy and my heart is troubled within me

10823 I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth and I am
shaken off as locusts

10824 My knees are weakened through fasting and my flesh is changed
for oil

For oil  Propter oleum The meaning is my flesh is changed being
perfectly emaciated and dried up as having lost all its oil or
fatness

10825 And I am become a reproach to them they saw me and they shaked
their heads

10826 Help me O Lord my God save me according to thy mercy

10827 And let them know that this is thy hand and that thou O Lord
hast done it

10828 They will curse and thou wilt bless let them that rise up
against me be confounded but thy servant shall rejoice

10829 Let them that detract me be clothed with shame and let them be
covered with their confusion as with a double cloak

10830 I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth and in the
midst of many I will praise him

10831 Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor to save my
soul from persecutors



Psalms Chapter 109


Dixit Dominus

Christs exaltation and everlasting priesthood

1091 A psalm for David The Lord said to my Lord Sit thou at my
right hand Until I make thy enemies thy footstool

1092 The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion
rule thou in the midst of thy enemies

1093 With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength in the
brightness of the saints from the womb before the day star I begot
thee

1094 The Lord hath sworn and he will not repent Thou art a priest
for ever according to the order of Melchisedech

1095 The Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his
wrath

1096 He shall judge among nations he shall fill ruins he shall
crush the heads in the land of many

1097 He shall drink of the torrent in the way therefore shall he
lift up the head

understanding to all that do it his praise continueth for ever and
ever

exceedingly in his commandments

order his words with judgment

1116 Because he shall not be moved for ever

Psalms Chapter 113


In exitu Israel

God hath shewn his power in delivering his people idols are vain The
Hebrews divide this into two psalms

Alleluia

1131 When Israel went out of Egypt the house of Jacob from a
barbarous people

1132 Judea was made his sanctuary Israel his dominion

1133 The sea saw and fled Jordan was turned back

1134 The mountains skipped like rams and the hills like the lambs of
the flock

1135 What ailed thee O thou sea that thou didst flee and thou
O Jordan that thou wast turned back

1136 Ye mountains that ye skipped like rams and ye hills like
lambs of the flock

1137 At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved at the presence
of the God of Jacob

1138 Who turned the rock into pools of water and the stony hill into
fountains of waters

1131 Not to us O Lord not to us but to thy name give glory

1132 For thy mercy and for thy truths sake lest the Gentiles
should say Where is their God

1133 But our God is in heaven he hath done all things whatsoever he
would

1134 The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold the works of the
hands of men

1135 They have mouths and speak not they have eyes and see not

1136 They have ears and hear not they have noses and smell not

1137 They have hands and feel not they have feet and walk not
neither shall they cry out through their throat

1138 Let them that make them become like unto them and all such as
trust in them

1139 The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord he is their helper
and their protector

11310 The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord he is their helper
and their protector

11311 They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord he is their
helper and their protector

11312 The Lord hath been mindful of us and hath blessed us He hath
blessed the house of Israel he hath blessed the house of Aaron

11313 He hath blessed all that fear the Lord both little and great

11314 May the Lord add blessings upon you upon you and upon your
children

11315 Blessed be you of the Lord who made heaven and earth

11316 The heaven of heaven is the Lords but the earth he has given
to the children of men

11317 The dead shall not praise thee O Lord nor any of them that go
down to hell

11318 But we that live bless the Lord from this time now and for

God

Psalms Chapter 118


Beati immaculati

Of the excellence of virtue consisting in the love and observance of
the commandments of God

Alleluia

ALEPH

Aleph  The first eight verses of this psalm in the original begin
with Aleph which is the name of the first letter of the Hebrew
alphabet The second eight verses begin with Beth the name of the
second letter of the Hebrew alphabet and so to the end of the whole
alphabet in all twentytwo letters each letter having eight verses
This order is variously expounded by the holy fathers which shews the
difficulty of understanding the holy scriptures and consequently with
what humility and submission to the Church they are to be read

1181 Blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the
Lord

1182 Blessed are they that search his testimonies that seek him with
their whole heart

His testimonies  The commandments of God are called his testimonies
because they testify his holy will unto us Note here that in almost
every verse of this psalm which in number are 176 the word and law of
God and the love and observance of it is perpetually inculcated
under a variety of denominations all signifying the same thing

1183 For they that work iniquity have not walked in his ways

1184 Thou hast commanded thy commandments to be kept most diligently

1185 O that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications

1186 Then shall I not be confounded when I shall look into all thy
commandments

1187 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart when I shall have
learned the judgments of thy justice

1188 I will keep thy justifications O do not thou utterly forsake
me

words

thee

11812 Blessed art thou O Lord teach me thy justifications

11813 With my lips I have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth

11814 I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies as in all
riches

11815 I will meditate on thy commandments and I will consider thy
ways

11816 I will think of thy justifications I will not forget thy
words

GIMEL

11817 Give bountifully to thy servant enliven me and I shall keep
thy words

11818 Open thou my eyes and I will consider the wondrous things of
thy law

11819 I am a sojourner on the earth hide not thy commandments from
me

11820 My soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications at all
times

11821 Thou hast rebuked the proud they are cursed who decline from
thy commandments

11822 Remove from me reproach and contempt because I have sought
after thy testimonies

11823 For princes sat and spoke against me but thy servant was
employed in thy justifications

11824 For thy testimonies are my meditation and thy justifications
my counsel

DALETH

11825 My soul hath cleaved to the pavement quicken thou me according
to thy word

shall be exercised in thy wondrous works

thy words

mercy on me

11830 I have chosen the way of truth thy judgments I have not
forgotten

11831 I have stuck to thy testimonies O Lord put me not to shame

11832 I have run the way of thy commandments when thou didst enlarge
my heart

HE

11833 Set before me for a law the way of thy justifications O Lord
and I will always seek after it

11834 Give me understanding and I will search thy law and I will
keep it with my whole heart

11835 Lead me into the path of thy commandments for this same I have
desired

11836 Incline my heart into thy testimonies and not to covetousness

11837 Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity quicken me
in thy way

11838 Establish thy word to thy servant in thy fear

11839 Turn away my reproach which I have apprehended for thy
judgments are delightful

justice

VAU

11841 Let thy mercy also come upon me O Lord thy salvation
according to thy word

11842 So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing that I
have trusted in thy words

11843 And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth
for in thy words I have hoped exceedingly

11844 So shall I always keep thy law for ever and ever

11845 And I walked at large because I have sought after thy
commandments

11846 And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings and I was not
ashamed

11847 I meditated also on thy commandments which I loved

11848 And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments which I loved
and I was exercised in thy justifications

ZAIN

given me hope

enlivened me

thy law

11852 I remembered O Lord thy judgments of old and I was
comforted

forsake thy law

my pilgrimage

thy law

11856 This happened to me because I sought after thy justifications

according to thy word

11859 I have thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy
testimonies

11860 I am ready and am not troubled that I may keep thy
commandments

11861 The cords of the wicked have encompassed me but I have not
forgotten thy law

11862 I rose at midnight to give praise to thee for the judgments of
thy justification

11863 I am a partaker with all them that fear thee and that keep thy
commandments

11864 The earth O Lord is full of thy mercy teach me thy
justifications

TETH

word

be confounded

CAPH

11881 My soul hath fainted after thy salvation and in thy word I
have very much hoped

11882 My eyes have failed for thy word saying When wilt thou
comfort me

11883 For I am become like a bottle in the frost I have not
forgotten thy justifications

11884 How many are the days of thy servant when wilt thou execute
judgment on them that persecute me

Psalms Chapter 119


Ad Dominum

A prayer in tribulation

A gradual canticle

A gradual canticle  The following psalms in number fifteen are
called gradual psalms or canticles from the word gradus signifying
steps ascensions or degrees either because they were appointed to be
sung on the fifteen steps by which the people ascended to the temple
or that in the singing of them the voice was to be raised by certain
steps or ascensions or that they were to be sung by the people
returning from their captivity and ascending to Jerusalem which was
seated amongst mountains The holy fathers in a mystical sense
understand these steps or ascensions of the degrees by which
Christians spiritually ascend to virtue and perfection and to the true
temple of God in the heavenly Jerusalem

1191 In my trouble I cried to the Lord and he heard me

1192 O Lord deliver my soul from wicked lips and a deceitful
tongue

1193 What shall be given to thee or what shall be added to thee to
a deceitful tongue

1194 The sharp arrows of the mighty with coals that lay waste

1195 Woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged I have dwelt with
the inhabitants of Cedar

1196 My soul hath been long a sojourner

1197 With them that hated peace I was peaceable when I spoke to them
they fought against me without cause



Psalms Chapter 120


Levavi oculos

shall come to me

1202 My help is from the Lord who made heaven and earth

1203 May he not suffer thy foot to be moved neither let him slumber
that keepeth thee

1204 Behold he shall neither slumber nor sleep that keepeth Israel

1205 The Lord is thy keeper the Lord is thy protection upon thy
right hand

1206 The sun shall not burn thee by day nor the moon by night

1207 The Lord keepeth thee from all evil may the Lord keep thy soul

1208 May the Lord keep thy coming in and thy going out from
henceforth now and for ever



Psalms Chapter 121

1213 Jerusalem which is built as a city which is compact together

1214 For thither did the tribes go up the tribes of the Lord the
testimony of Israel to praise the name of the Lord

1215 Because their seats have sat in judgment seats upon the house
of David

1216 Pray ye for the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem and
abundance for them that love thee

1217 Let peace be in thy strength and abundance in thy towers

1218 For the sake of my brethren and of my neighbours I spoke peace
of thee

1219 Because of the house of the Lord our God I have sought good
things for thee

masters As the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands of her mistress
so are our eyes unto the Lord our God until he have mercy on us

1223 Have mercy on us O Lord have mercy on us for we are greatly
filled with contempt

1224 For our soul is greatly filled we are a reproach to the rich
and contempt to the proud

her enemies

us let Israel now say

1232 If it had not been that the Lord was with us When men rose up
against us

1233 Perhaps they had swallowed us up alive When their fury was
enkindled against us

1234 Perhaps the waters had swallowed us up

1235 Our soul hath passed through a torrent perhaps our soul had
passed through a water insupportable

1236 Blessed be the Lord who hath not given us to be a prey to their
teeth

1237 Our soul hath been delivered as a sparrow out of the snare of
the fowlers The snare is broken and we are delivered

1238 Our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth

the just that the just may not stretch forth their hands to iniquity

heart

1245 But such as turn aside into bonds the Lord shall lead out with
the workers of iniquity peace upon Israel

1254 Turn again our captivity O Lord as a stream in the south

1255 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy

1256 Going they went and wept casting their seeds

1257 But coming they shall come with joyfulness carrying their
sheaves

sitten you that eat the bread of sorrow When he shall give sleep to
his beloved

It is vain for you to rise before light  That is your early rising
your labour and worldly solicitude will be vain that is will avail
you nothing without the light grace and blessing of God

1263 Behold the inheritance of the Lord are children the reward the
fruit of the womb

children as olive plants round about thy table

1274 Behold thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord

things of Jerusalem all the days of thy life

1286 Let them be as grass upon the tops of houses which withereth
before it be plucked up

1287 Who with the mower filleth not his hand nor he that gathereth
sheaves his bosom

1288 And they that passed by have not said The blessing of the Lord
be upon you we have blessed you in the name of the Lord

Memento Domine

A prayer for the fulfilling of the promise made to David

1311 A gradual canticle O Lord remember David and all his
meekness

1312 How he swore to the Lord he vowed a vow to the God of Jacob

1313 If I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house if I shall go
up into the bed wherein I lie

1314 If I shall give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids

1315 Or rest to my temples until I find out a place for the Lord a
tabernacle for the God of Jacob

1316 Behold we have heard of it in Ephrata we have found it in the
fields of the wood

We have heard of it in Ephrata  When I was young and lived in
Bethlehem otherwise called Ephrata I heard of Gods tabernacle and
ark and had a devout desire of seeking it and accordingly I found it
at Cariathiarim the city of the woods where it was till it was
removed to Jerusalem See 1 Par 13

1317 We will go into his tabernacle we will adore in the place where
his feet stood

1318 Arise O Lord into thy resting place thou and the ark which
thou hast sanctified

1319 Let thy priests be clothed with justice and let thy saints
rejoice

13110 For thy servant Davids sake turn not away the face of thy
anointed

13111 The Lord hath sworn truth to David and he will not make it
void of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy throne

13112 If thy children will keep my covenant and these my testimonies
which I shall teach them Their children also for evermore shall sit
upon thy throne

13113 For the Lord hath chosen Sion he hath chosen it for his
dwelling

13114 This is my rest for ever and ever here will I dwell for I
have chosen it

13115 Blessing I will bless her widow I will satisfy her poor with
bread

13116 I will clothe her priests with salvation and her saints shall
rejoice with exceeding great joy

13117 There will I bring forth a horn to David I have prepared a
lamp for my anointed

13118 His enemies I will clothe with confusion but upon him shall my
sanctification flourish

generations

13414 For the Lord will judge his people and will be entreated in
favour of his servants

13415 The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold the works of
mens hands

13416 They have a mouth but they speak not they have eyes but they
see not

13417 They have ears but they hear not neither is there any breath

Super flumina

The lamentation of the people of God in their captivity in Babylon

A psalm of David for Jeremias

For Jeremias  For the time of Jeremias and the captivity of Babylon

1361 Upon the rivers of Babylon there we sat and wept when we
remembered Sion

1362 On the willows in the midst thereof we hung up our instruments

1363 For there they that led us into captivity required of us the
words of songs And they that carried us away said Sing ye to us a
hymn of the songs of Sion

1364 How shall we sing the song of the Lord in a strange land

1365 If I forget thee O Jerusalem let my right hand be forgotten

1366 Let my tongue cleave to my jaws if I do not remember thee If I
make not Jerusalem the beginning of my joy

1367 Remember O Lord the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem
Who say Rase it rase it even to the foundation thereof

1368 O daughter of Babylon miserable blessed shall he be who shall
repay thee thy payment which thou hast paid us

1369 Blessed be he that shall take and dash thy little ones against
the rock

Dash thy little ones etc  In the spiritual sense we dash the little
ones of Babylon against the rock when we mortify our passions and
stifle the first motions of them by a speedy recourse to the rock
which is Christ

Psalms Chapter 138


Domine probasti

Gods special providence over his servants

1381 Unto the end a psalm of David Lord thou hast proved me and
known me

1382 Thou hast known my sitting down and my rising up

1383 Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off my path and my line
thou hast searched out

1384 And thou hast foreseen all my ways for there is no speech in my
tongue

There is no speech etc  Viz unknown to thee or when there is no
speech in my tongue yet my whole interior and my most secret thoughts
are known to thee

1385 Behold O Lord thou hast known all things the last and those
of old thou hast formed me and hast laid thy hand upon me

1386 Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me it is high and I
cannot reach to it

1387 Whither shall I go from thy spirit or whither shall I flee from
thy face

1388 If I ascend into heaven thou art there if I descend into hell
thou art present

1389 If I take my wings early in the morning and dwell in the
uttermost parts of the sea

13810 Even there also shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand
shall hold me

13811 And I said Perhaps darkness shall cover me and night shall be
my light in my pleasures

13812 But darkness shall not be dark to thee and night shall be
light all the day the darkness thereof and the light thereof are
alike to thee

13813 For thou hast possessed my reins thou hast protected me from
my mothers womb

13814 I will praise thee for thou art fearfully magnified wonderful
are thy works and my soul knoweth right well

13815 My bone is not hidden from thee which thou hast made in
secret and my substance in the lower parts of the earth

13816 Thy eyes did see my imperfect being and in thy book all shall
be written days shall be formed and no one in them

13817 But to me thy friends O God are made exceedingly honourable
their principality is exceedingly strengthened

13818 I will number them and they shall be multiplied above the
sand I rose up and am still with thee

13819 If thou wilt kill the wicked O God ye men of blood depart
from me

13820 Because you say in thought They shall receive thy cities in
vain

Because you say in thought etc  Depart from me you wicked who plot
against the servants of God and think to cast them out of the cities
of their habitation as if they have received them in vain and to no
purpose

13821 Have I not hated them O Lord that hated thee and pined away
because of thy enemies

13822 I have hated them with a perfect hatred and they are become
enemies to me

I have hated them  Not with an hatred of malice but a zeal for the
observance of Gods commandments which he saw were despised by the
wicked who are to be considered enemies to God

13823 Prove me O God and know my heart examine me and know my
paths

13824 And see if there be in me the way of iniquity and lead me in
the eternal way

1391 Unto the end a psalm of David

man

1393 Who have devised iniquities in their hearts all the day long
they designed battles

1394 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent the venom of
asps is under their lips

1395 Keep me O Lord from the hand of the wicked and from unjust
men deliver me Who have proposed to supplant my steps

1396 The proud have hidden a net for me And they have stretched out
cords for a snare they have laid for me a stumblingblock by the
wayside

1397 I said to the Lord Thou art my God hear O Lord the voice of
my supplication

1398 O Lord Lord the strength of my salvation thou hast
overshadowed my head in the day of battle

1399 Give me not up O Lord from my desire to the wicked they have
plotted against me do not thou forsake me lest they should triumph

13910 The head of them compassing me about the labour of their lips
shall overwhelm them

13911 Burning coals shall fall upon them thou wilt cast them down
into the fire in miseries they shall not be able to stand

13912 A man full of tongue shall not be established in the earth
evil shall catch the unjust man unto destruction

13913 I know that the Lord will do justice to the needy and will
revenge the poor

13914 But as for the just they shall give glory to thy name and the
upright shall dwell with thy countenance

Domine clamavi

A prayer against sinful words and deceitful flatterers

A psalm of David

I cry to thee

1402 Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight the lifting
up of my hands as evening sacrifice

1403 Set a watch O Lord before my mouth and a door round about my
lips

1404 Incline not my heart to evil words to make excuses in sins
With men that work iniquity and I will not communicate with the
choicest of them

1405 The just man shall correct me in mercy and shall reprove me
but let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head For my prayer shall
still be against the things with which they are well pleased

Let not the oil of the sinner etc  That is the flattery or
deceitful praiseIbid For my prayer etc  So far from coveting
their praises who are never well pleased but with things that are
evil I shall continually pray to be preserved from such things as they
are delighted with

1406 Their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up They
shall hear my words for they have prevailed

Their judges etc  Their rulers or chiefs quickly vanish and
perish like ships dashed against the rocks and swallowed up by the
waves Let them then hear my words for they are powerful and will
prevail or as it is in the Hebrew for they are sweet

1407 As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground
Our bones are scattered by the side of hell

1408 But to thee O Lord Lord are my eyes in thee have I put my
trust take not away my soul

1409 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me and from
the stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity

14010 The wicked shall fall in his net I am alone until I pass

I am alone etc  Singularly protected by the Almighty until I pass
all their nets and snares

trouble

way wherein I walked they have hidden a snare for me

1415 I looked on my right hand and beheld and there was no one that
would know me Flight hath failed me and there is no one that hath
regard to my soul

1416 I cried to thee O Lord I said Thou art my hope my portion in
the land of the living

from my persecutors for they are stronger than I

1418 Bring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name the
just wait for me until thou reward me

away thy face from me lest I be like unto them that go down into the
pit

hoped Make the way known to me wherein I should walk for I have
lifted up my soul to thee

shall lead me into the right land

14211 for thy names sake O Lord thou wilt quicken me in thy justice
Thou wilt bring my soul out of trouble

cut off all them that afflict my soul for I am thy servant

14312 Whose sons are as new plants in their youth Their daughters
decked out adorned round about after the similitude of a temple

14313 Their storehouses full flowing out of this into that Their
sheep fruitful in young abounding in their goings forth

crying out in their streets

14315 They have called the people happy that hath these things but
happy is that people whose God is the Lord

THE BOOK OF PROVERBS



This Book is so called because it consists of wise and weighty
sentences regulating the morals of men and directing them to wisdom
and virtue And these sentences are also called PARABLES because great
truths are often couched in them under certain figures and similitudes



Proverbs Chapter 1


The use and end of the proverbs An exhortation to flee the company of
the wicked and to hearken to the voice of wisdom

11 The parables of Solomon the son of David king of Israel

12 To know wisdom and instruction

13 To understand the words of prudence and to receive the
instruction of doctrine justice and judgment and equity

14 To give subtilty to little ones to the young man knowledge and
understanding

15 A wise man shall hear and shall be wiser and he that
understandeth shall possess governments

16 He shall understand a parable and the interpretation the words of
the wise and their mysterious sayings

17 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom Fools despise
wisdom and instruction

18 My son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the
law of thy mother

19 That grace may be added to thy head and a chain of gold to thy
neck

110 My son if sinners shall entice thee consent not to them

111 If they shall say Come with us let us lie in wait for blood
let us hide snares for the innocent without cause

112 Let us swallow him up alive like hell and whole as one that
goeth down into the pit

113 We shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses
with spoils

114 Cast in thy lot with us let us all have one purse

115 My son walk not thou with them restrain thy foot from their
paths

116 For their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood

117 But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have
wings

118 And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood and practise
deceits against their own souls

119 So the ways of every covetous man destroy the souls of the
possessors

120 Wisdom preacheth abroad she uttereth her voice in the streets

121 At the head of multitudes she crieth out in the entrance of the
gates of the city she uttereth her words saying

122 O children how long will you love childishness and fools covet
those things which are hurtful to themselves and the unwise hate
knowledge

123 Turn ye at my reproof behold I will utter my spirit to you and
will shew you my words

124 Because I called and you refused I stretched out my hand and
there was none that regarded

125 You have despised all my counsel and have neglected my
reprehensions

126 I also will laugh in your destruction and will mock when that
shall come to you which you feared

127 When sudden calamity shall fall on you and destruction as a
tempest shall be at hand when tribulation and distress shall come
upon you

128 Then shall they call upon me and I will not hear they shall
rise in the morning and shall not find me

129 Because they have hated instruction and received not the fear of
the Lord

130 Nor consented to my counsel but despised all my reproof

131 Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way and shall be
filled with their own devices

132 The turning away of little ones shall kill them and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them

133 But he that shall hear me shall rest without terror and shall
enjoy abundance without fear of evils



Proverbs Chapter 2


The advantages of wisdom and the evils from which it delivers

21 My son if thou wilt receive my words and wilt hide my
commandments with thee

22 That thy ear may hearken to wisdom incline thy heart to know
prudence

23 For if thou shalt call for wisdom and incline thy heart to
prudence

24 If thou shalt seek her as money and shalt dig for her as for a
treasure

25 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord and shalt find
the knowledge of God

26 Because the Lord giveth wisdom and out of his mouth cometh
prudence and knowledge

27 He wilt keep the salvation of the righteous and protect them that
walk in simplicity

28 Keeping the paths of justice and guarding the ways of saints

29 Then shalt thou understand justice and judgment and equity and
every good path

210 If wisdom shall enter into thy heart and knowledge please thy
soul

211 Counsel shall keep thee and prudence shall preserve thee

212 That thou mayst be delivered from the evil way and from the man
that speaketh perverse things

213 Who leave the right way and walk by dark ways

214 Who are glad when they have done evil and rejoice in the most
wicked things

215 Whose ways are perverse and their steps infamous

216 That thou mayst be delivered from the strange woman and from the
stranger who softeneth her words

217 And forsaketh the guide of her youth

218 And hath forgotten the covenant of her God for her house
inclineth unto death and her paths to hell

219 None that go in unto her shall return again neither shall they
take hold of the paths of life

220 That thou mayst walk in a good way and mayst keep the paths of
the just

221 For they that are upright shall dwell in the earth and the
simple shall continue in it

222 But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth and they that
do unjustly shall be taken away from it



Proverbs Chapter 3


An exhortation to the practice of virtue

31 My son forget not my law and let thy heart keep my commandments

32 For they shall add to thee length of days and years of life and
peace

33 Let not mercy aud truth leave thee put them about thy neck and
write them in the tables of thy heart

34 And thou shalt find grace and good understanding before God and
men

35 Have confidence in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not upon
thy own prudence

36 In all thy ways think on him and he will direct thy steps

37 Be not wise in thy own conceit fear God and depart from evil

38 For it shall be health to thy navel and moistening to thy bones

39 Honour the Lord with thy substance and give him of the first of
all thy fruits

310 And thy barns shall be filled with abundance and thy presses
shall run over with wine

311 My son reject not the correction of the Lord and do not faint
when thou art chastised by him

312 For whom the Lord loveth he chastiseth and as a father in the
son he pleaseth himself

313 Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom and is rich in prudence

314 The purchasing thereof is better than the merchandise of silver
and her fruit than the chief and purest gold

315 She is more precious than all riches and all the things that are
desired are not to be compared to her

316 Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches
and glory

317 Her ways are beautiful ways and all her paths are peaceable

318 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her and he that
shall retain her is blessed

319 The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth hath established the
heavens by prudence

320 By his wisdom the depths have broken out and the clouds grow
thick with dew

321 My son let not these things depart from thy eyes keep the law
and counsel

322 And there shall be life to thy soul and grace to thy mouth

323 Then shalt thou walk confidently in thy way and thy foot shall
not stumble

324 If thou sleep thou shalt not fear thou shalt rest and thy
sleep shall be sweet

325 Be not afraid of sudden fear nor of the power of the wicked
falling upon thee

326 For the Lord will be at thy side and will keep thy foot that
thou be not taken

327 Do not withhold him from doing good who is able if thou art
able do good thyself also

328 Say not to thy friend Go and come again and to morrow I will
give to thee when thou canst give at present

329 Practise not evil against thy friend when he hath confidence in
thee

330 Strive not against a man without cause when he hath done thee no
evil

331 Envy not the unjust man and do not follow his ways

332 For every mocker is an abomination to the Lord and his
communication is with the simple

333 Want is from the Lord in the house of the wicked but the
habitations of the just shall be blessed

334 He shall scorn the scorners and to the meek he will give grace

335 The wise shall possess glory the promotion of fools is disgrace



Proverbs Chapter 4


A further exhortation to seek after wisdom

41 Hear ye children the instruction of a father and attend that
you may know prudence

42 I will give you a good gift forsake not my law

43 For I also was my fathers son tender and as an only son in the
sight of my mother

44 And he taught me and said Let thy heart receive my words keep
my commandments and thou shalt live

45 Get wisdom get prudence forget not neither decline from the
words of my mouth

46 Forsake her not and she shall keep thee love her and she shall
preserve thee

47 The beginning of wisdom get wisdom and with all thy possession
purchase prudence

48 Take hold on her and she shall exalt thee thou shalt be
glorified by her when thou shalt embrace her

49 She shall give to thy head increase of graces and protect thee
with a noble crown

410 Hear O my son and receive my words that years of life may be
multiplied to thee

411 I will shew thee the way of wisdom I will lead thee by the paths
of equity

412 Which when thou shalt have entered thy steps shall not be
straitened and when thou runnest thou shalt not meet a
stumblingblock

413 Take hold on instruction leave it not keep it because it is
thy life

414 Be not delighted in the paths of the wicked neither let the way
of evil men please thee

415 Flee from it pass not by it go aside and forsake it

416 For they sleep not except they have done evil and their sleep
is taken away unless they have made some to fall

417 They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of iniquity

418 But the path of the just as a shining light goeth forwards and
increaseth even to perfect day

419 The way of the wicked is darksome they know not where they fall

420 My son hearken to my words and incline thy ear to my sayings

421 Let them not depart from thy eyes keep them in the midst of thy
heart

422 For they are life to those that find them and health to all
flesh

423 With all watchfulness keep thy heart because life issueth out
from it

424 Remove from thee a froward mouth and let detracting lips be far
from thee

425 Let thy eyes look straight on and let thy eyelids go before thy
steps

426 Make straight the path for thy feet and all thy ways shall be
established

427 Decline not to the right hand nor to the left turn away thy
foot from evil For the Lord knoweth the ways that are on the right
hand but those are perverse which are on the left hand But he will
make thy courses straight he will bring forward thy ways in peace



Proverbs Chapter 5


An exhortation to fly unlawful lust and the occasions of it

51 My son attend to my wisdom and incline thy ear to my prudence

52 That thou mayst keep thoughts and thy lips may preserve
instruction Mind not the deceit of a woman

53 For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping and her
throat is smoother than oil

54 But her end is bitter as wormwood and sharp as a twoedged sword

55 Her feet go down into death and her steps go in as far as hell

56 They walk not by the path of life her steps are wandering and
unaccountable

57 Now therefore my son hear me and depart not from the words of
my mouth

58 Remove thy way far from her and come not nigh the doors of her
house

59 Give not thy honour to strangers and thy years to the cruel

510 Lest strangers be filled with thy strength and thy labours be in
another mans house

511 And thou mourn at the last when thou shalt have spent thy flesh
and thy body and say

512 Why have I hated instruction and my heart consented not to
reproof

513 And have not heard the voice of them that taught me and have not
inclined my ear to masters

514 I have almost been in all evil in the midst of the church and of
the congregation

515 Drink water out of thy own cistern and the streams of thy own
well

516 Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad and in the streets divide
thy waters

517 Keep them to thyself alone neither let strangers be partakers
with thee

518 Let thy vein be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth

519 Let her be thy dearest hind and most agreeable fawn let her
breasts inebriate thee at all times be thou delighted continually with
her love

520 Why art thou seduced my son by a strange woman and art
cherished in the bosom of another

521 The Lord beholdeth the ways of man and considereth all his
steps

522 His own iniquities catch the wicked and he is fast bound with
the ropes of his own sins

523 He shall die because he hath not received instruction and in
the multitude of his folly he shall be deceived



Proverbs Chapter 6


Documents on several heads

61 My son if thou be surety for thy friend thou hast engaged fast
thy hand to a stranger

62 Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth and caught with thy
own words

63 Do therefore my son what I say and deliver thyself because
thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour Run about make haste
stir up thy friend

64 Give not sleep to thy eyes neither let thy eyelids slumber

65 Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand and as a bird from the
hand of the fowler

66 Go to the ant O sluggard and consider her ways and learn
wisdom

67 Which although she hath no guide nor master nor captain

68 Provideth her meat for herself in the summer and gathereth her
food in the harvest

69 How long wilt thou sleep O sluggard when wilt thou arise out of
thy sleep

610 Thou wilt sleep a little thou wilt slumber a little thou wilt
fold thy hands a little to sleep

611 And want shall come upon thee as a traveller and poverty as a
man armed But if thou be diligent thy harvest shall come as a
fountain and want shall flee far from thee

612 A man that is an apostate an unprofitable man walketh with a
perverse mouth

613 He winketh with the eyes presseth with the foot speaketh with
the finger

614 With a wicked heart he deviseth evil and at all times he soweth
discord

615 To such a one his destruction shall presently come and he shall
suddenly be destroyed and shall no longer have any remedy

616 Six things there are which the Lord hateth and the seventh his
soul detesteth

617 Haughty eyes a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood

618 A heart that deviseth wicked plots feet that are swift to run
into mischief

619 A deceitful witness that uttereth lies and him that soweth
discord among brethren

620 My son keep the commandments of thy father and forsake not the
law of thy mother

621 Bind them in thy heart continually and put them about thy neck

622 When thou walkest let them go with thee when thou sleepest let
them keep thee and when thou awakest talk with them

623 Because the commandment is a lamp and the law a light and
reproofs of instruction are the way of life

624 That they may keep thee from the evil woman and from the
flattering tongue of the stranger

625 Let not thy heart covet her beauty be not caught with her winks

626 For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf but the woman
catcheth the precious soul of a man

627 Can a man hide fire in his bosom and his garments not burn

628 Or can he walk upon hot coals and his feet not be burnt

629 So he that goeth in to his neighbours wife shall not be clean
when he shall touch her

630 The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen for he stealeth
to fill his hungry soul

The fault is not so great etc  The sin of theft is not so great as
to be compared with adultery especially when a person pressed with
hunger which is the case here spoken of steals to satisfy nature
Moreover the damage done by theft may much more easily be repaired
than the wrong done by adultery But this does not hinder but that
theft also is a mortal sin forbidden by one of the ten commandments

631 And if he be taken he shall restore sevenfold and shall give up
all the substance of his house

632 But he that is an adulterer for the folly of his heart shall
destroy his own soul

633 He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour and his reproach
shall not be blotted out

634 Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in
the day of revenge

635 Nor will he yield to any mans prayers nor will he accept for
satisfaction ever so many gifts



Proverbs Chapter 7


The love of wisdom is the best preservative from being led astray by
temptation

71 My son keep my words and lay up my precepts with thee Son

72 Keep my commandments and thou shalt live and my law as the apple
of thy eye

73 Bind it upon thy fingers write it upon the tables of thy heart

74 Say to wisdom Thou art my sister and call prudence thy friend

75 That she may keep thee from the woman that is not thine and from
the stranger who sweeteneth her words

76 For I looked out of the window of my house through the lattice

77 And I see little ones I behold a foolish young man

78 Who passeth through the street by the corner and goeth nigh the
way of her house

79 In the dark when it grows late in the darkness and obscurity of
the night

710 And behold a woman meeteth him in harlots attire prepared to
deceive souls talkative and wandering

711 Not bearing to be quiet not able to abide still at home

712 Now abroad now in the streets now lying in wait near the
corners

713 And catching the young man she kisseth him and with an impudent
face flattereth saying

714 I vowed victims for prosperity this day I have paid my vows

715 Therefore I am come out to meet thee desirous to see thee and I
have found thee

716 I have woven my bed with cords I have covered it with painted
tapestry brought from Egypt

717 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon

718 Come let us be inebriated with the breasts and let us enjoy the
desired embraces till the day appear

719 For my husband is not at home he is gone a very long journey

720 He took with him a bag of money he will return home the day of
the full moon

721 She entangled him with many words and drew him away with the
flattery of her lips

722 Immediately he followeth her as an ox led to be a victim and as
a lamb playing the wanton and not knowing that he is drawn like a fool
to bonds

723 Till the arrow pierce his liver as if a bird should make haste
to the snare and knoweth not that his life is in danger

724 Now therefore my son hear me and attend to the words of my
mouth

725 Let not thy mind be drawn away in her ways neither be thou
deceived with her paths

726 For she hath cast down many wounded and the strongest have been
slain by her

727 Her house is the way to hell reaching even to the inner chambers
of death



Proverbs Chapter 8


The preaching of wisdom Her excellence

81 Doth not wisdom cry aloud and prudence put forth her voice

82 Standing in the top of the highest places by the way in the midst
of the paths

83 Beside the gates of the city in the very doors she speaketh
saying

84 O ye men to you I call and my voice is to the sons of men

85 O little ones understand subtlety and ye unwise take notice

86 Hear for I will speak of great things and my lips shall be
opened to preach right things

87 My mouth shall meditate truth and my lips shall hate wickedness

88 All my words are just there is nothing wicked nor perverse in
them

89 They are right to them that understand and just to them that find
knowledge

810 Receive my instruction and not money choose knowledge rather
than gold

811 For wisdom is better than all the most precious things and
whatsoever may be desired cannot be compared to it

812 I wisdom dwell in counsel and am present in learned thoughts

813 The fear of the Lord hateth evil I hate arrogance and pride
and every wicked way and a mouth with a double tongue

814 Counsel and equity is mine prudence is mine strength is mine

815 By me kings reign and lawgivers decree just things

816 By me princes rule and the mighty decree justice

817 I love them that love me and they that in the morning early
watch for me shall find me

818 With me are riches and glory glorious riches and justice

819 For my fruit is better than gold and the precious stone and my
blossoms than choice silver

820 I walk in the way of justice in the midst of the paths of
judgment

821 That I may enrich them that love me and may fill their
treasures

822 The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways before he
made any thing from the beginning

823 I was set up from eternity and of old before the earth was
made

824 The depths were not as yet and I was already conceived neither
had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out

825 The mountains with their huge bulk had not as yet been
established before the hills I was brought forth

826 He had not yet made the earth nor the rivers nor the poles of
the world

827 When he prepared the heavens I was present when with a certain
law and compass he enclosed the depths

828 When he established the sky above and poised the fountains of
waters

829 When he compassed the sea with its bounds and set a law to the
waters that they should not pass their limits when he balanced the
foundations of the earth

830 I was with him forming all things and was delighted every day
playing before him at all times

831 Playing in the world and my delights were to be with the
children of men

832 Now therefore ye children hear me blessed are they that keep
my ways

833 Hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not

834 Blessed is the man that heareth me and that watcheth daily at my
gates and waiteth at the posts of my doors

835 He that shall find me shall find life and shall have salvation
from the Lord

836 But he that shall sin against me shall hurt his own soul All
that hate me love death



Proverbs Chapter 9


Wisdom invites all to her feast Folly calls another way

91 Wisdom hath built herself a house she hath hewn her out seven
pillars

92 She hath slain her victims mingled her wine and set forth her
table

93 She hath sent her maids to invite to the tower and to the walls
of the city

94 Whosoever is a little one let him come to me And to the unwise
she said

95 Come eat my bread and drink the wine which I have mingled for
you

96 Forsake childishness and live and walk by the ways of prudence

97 He that teacheth a scorner doth an injury to himself and he that
rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot

98 Rebuke not a scorner lest he hate thee Rebuke a wise man and he
will love thee

99 Give an occasion to a wise man and wisdom shall be added to him
Teach a just man and he shall make haste to receive it

910 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the
knowledge of the holy is prudence

911 For by me shall thy days be multiplied and years of life shall
be added to thee

912 If thou be wise thou shalt be so to thyself and if a scorner
thou alone shalt bear the evil

913 A foolish woman and clamorous and full of allurements and
knowing nothing at all

914 Sat at the door of her house upon a seat in a high place of the
city

915 To call them that pass by the way and go on their journey

916 He that is a little one let him turn to me And to the fool she
said

917 Stolen waters are sweeter and hidden bread is more pleasant

918 And he did not know that giants are there and that her guests
are in the depths of hell

inebriateth shall be inebriated also himself

1126 He that hideth up corn shall be cursed among the people but a
blessing upon the head of them that sell

1127 Well doth he rise early who seeketh good things but he that
seeketh after evil things shall be oppressed by them

1128 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall but the just shall
spring up as a green leaf

1129 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the winds and
the fool shall serve the wise

1130 The fruit of the just man is a tree of life and he that gaineth
souls is wise

1131 If the just man receive in the earth how much more the wicked
and the sinner



Proverbs Chapter 12


121 He that loveth correction loveth knowledge but he that hateth
reproof is foolish

122 He that is good shall draw grace from the Lord but he that
trusteth in his own devices doth wickedly

123 Man shall not be strengthened by wickedness and the root of the
just shall not be moved

124 A diligent woman is a crown to her husband and she that doth
things worthy of confusion is as rottenness in his bones

125 The thoughts of the just are judgments and the counsels of the
wicked are deceitful

126 The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood the mouth of the
just shall deliver them

127 Turn the wicked and they shall not be but the house of the just
shall stand firm

128 A man shall be known by his learning but he that is vain and
foolish shall be exposed to contempt

129 Better is the poor man that provideth for himself than he that
is glorious and wanteth bread

the wicked are cruel

1211 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread but he
that pursueth idleness is very foolish

1212 He that is delighted in passing his time over wine leaveth a
reproach in his strong holds

1212 The desire of the wicked is the fortification of evil men but
the root of the just shall prosper

1213 For the sins of the lips ruin draweth nigh to the evil man but
the just shall escape out of distress

1214 By the fruit of his own mouth shall a man be filled with good
things and according to the works of his hands it shall be repaid him

1215 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that is wise
hearkeneth unto counsels

1216 A fool immediately sheweth his anger but he that dissembleth
injuries is wise

1217 He that speaketh that which he knoweth sheweth forth justice
but he that lieth is a deceitful witness

1218 There is that promiseth and is pricked as it were with a sword
of conscience but the tongue of the wise is health

1219 The lip of truth shall be steadfast for ever but he that is a
hasty witness frameth a lying tongue

1220 Deceit is in the heart of them that think evil things but joy
followeth them that take counsels of peace

1221 Whatsoever shall befall the just man shall not make him sad
but the wicked shall be filled with mischief

1222 Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord but they that deal
faithfully please him

1223 A cautious man concealeth knowledge and the heart of fools
publisheth folly

1224 The hand of the valiant shall bear rule but that which is
slothful shall be under tribute

1225 Grief in the heart of a man shall bring him low but with a good
word he shall be made glad

1226 He that neglecteth a loss for the sake of a friend is just but
the way of the wicked shall deceive them

just man shall be precious gold

1228 In the path of justice is life but the byeway leadeth to
death



Proverbs Chapter 13

scorner heareth not when he is reproved

things but the soul of transgressors is wicked

guard on his speech shall meet with evils

work shall be made fat

135 The just shall hate a lying word but the wicked confoundeth and
shall be confounded

overthroweth the sinner

were poor when he hath great riches

beareth not reprehension

139 The light of the just giveth joy but the lamp of the wicked
shall be put out

1310 Among the proud there are always contentions but they that do
all things with counsel are ruled by wisdom

little and little is gathered with the hand shall increase

1312 Hope that is deferred afflicteth the soul desire when it
cometh is a tree of life

time to come but he that feareth the commandment shall dwell in
peace Deceitful souls go astray in sins the just are merciful and

yieldeth to reproof shall be glorified

them that flee from evil things

1320 He that walketh with the wise shall be wise a friend of fools
shall become like to them

1321 Evil pursueth sinners and to the just good shall be repaid

1322 The good man leaveth heirs sons and grandsons and the
substance of the sinner is kept for the just

1323 Much food is in the tillage of fathers but for others it is
gathered without judgment

1324 He that spareth the rod hateth his son but he that loveth him
correcteth him betimes

1325 The just eateth and filleth his soul but the belly of the
wicked is never to be filled



Proverbs Chapter 14


141 A wise woman buildeth her house but the foolish will pull down
with her hands that also which is built

142 He that walketh in the right way and feareth God is despised by
him that goeth by an infamous way

143 In the mouth of a fool is the rod of pride but the lips of the
wise preserve them

144 Where there are no oxen the crib is empty but where there is
much corn there the strength of the ox is manifest

145 A faithful witness will not lie but a deceitful witness uttereth
a lie

146 A scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not the learning of the
wise is easy

147 Go against a foolish man and he knoweth not the lips of
prudence

148 The wisdom of a discreet man is to understand his way and the
imprudence of fools erreth

1410 The heart that knoweth the bitterness of his own soul in his
joy the stranger shall not intermeddle

1411 The house of the wicked shall be destroyed but the tabernacles
of the just shall flourish

1412 There is a way which seemeth just to a man but the ends thereof
lead to death

of the ends of joy

1414 A fool shall be filled with his own ways and the good man shall
be above him

his steps No good shall come to the deceitful son but the wise
servant shall prosper in his dealings and his way shall be made
straight

knowledge

the gates of the just

friends of the rich are many

1421 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth but he that sheweth
mercy to the poor shall be blessed He that believeth in the Lord
loveth mercy

1422 They err that work evil but mercy and truth prepare good
things

1423 In much work there shall be abundance but where there are many
words there is oftentimes want

1424 The crown of the wise is their riches the folly of fools
imprudence

1425 A faithful witness delivereth souls and the double dealer
uttereth lies

1426 In the fear of the Lord is confidence of strength and there
shall be hope for his children

1427 The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life to decline from the
ruin of death

1428 In the multitude of people is the dignity of the king and in
the small number of the people the dishonour of the prince

impatient exalteth his folly

1430 Soundness of heart is the life of the flesh but envy is the
rottenness of the bones

hath pity on the poor honoureth him

just hath hope in his death

1433 In the heart of the prudent resteth wisdom and it shall
instruct all the ignorant

1434 Justice exalteth a nation but sin maketh nations miserable

1435 A wise servant is acceptable to the king he that is good for
nothing shall feel his anger



Proverbs Chapter 15


151 A mild answer breaketh wrath but a harsh word stirreth up fury

152 The tongue of the wise adorneth knowledge but the mouth of fools
bubbleth out folly

153 The eyes of the Lord in every place behold the good and the evil

154 A peaceable tongue is a tree of life but that which is
immoderate shall crush the spirit

155 A fool laugheth at the instruction of his father but he that
regardeth reproofs shall become prudent In abundant justice there is
the greatest strength but the devices of the wicked shall be rooted
out

the wicked is trouble

157 The lips of the wise shall disperse knowledge the heart of fools
shall be unlike

158 The victims of the wicked are abominable to the Lord the vows of
the just are acceptable

159 The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord he that
followeth justice is beloved by him

1510 Instruction is grievous to him that forsaketh the way of life
he that hateth reproof shall die

1511 Hell and destruction are before the Lord how much more the
hearts of the children of men

1512 A corrupt man loveth not one that reproveth him nor will he go
to the wise

1513 A glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by grief of mind
the spirit is cast down

1514 The heart of the wise seeketh instruction and the mouth of
fools feedeth on foolishness

1515 All the days of the poor are evil a secure mind is like a
continual feast

1516 Better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great
treasures without content

1517 It is better to be invited to herbs with love than to a fatted
calf with hatred

appeaseth those that are stirred up

just is without offence

1520 A wise son maketh a father joyful but the foolish man despiseth
his mother

1521 Folly is joy to the fool and the wise man maketh straight his
steps

1522 Designs are brought to nothing where there is no counsel but
where there are many counsellors they are established

1523 A man rejoiceth in the sentence of his mouth and a word in due
time is best

1524 The path of life is above for the wise that he may decline from
the lowest hell

1525 The Lord will destroy the house of the proud and will
strengthen the borders of the widow

1526 Evil thoughts are an abomination to the Lord and pure words
most beautiful shall be confirmed by him

that yieldeth to reproof possesseth understanding

1533 The fear of the Lord is the lesson of wisdom and humility goeth
before glory



Proverbs Chapter 16


161 It is the part of man to prepare the soul and of the Lord to
govern the tongue

It is the part of man etc  That is a man should prepare in his
heart and soul what he is to say but after all it must be the Lord
that must govern his tongue to speak to the purpose Not that we can
think any thing of good without Gods grace but that after we have
with Gods grace thought and prepared within our souls what we would
speak if God does not govern our tongue we shall not succeed in what
we speak

162 All the ways of a man are open to his eyes the Lord is the
weigher of spirits

163 Lay open thy works to the Lord and thy thoughts shall be
directed

164 The Lord hath made all things for himself the wicked also for
the evil day

165 Every proud man is an abomination to the Lord though hand should
be joined to hand he is not innocent The beginning of a good way is
to do justice and this is more acceptable with God than to offer
sacrifices

166 By mercy and truth iniquity is redeemed and by the fear of the
Lord men depart from evil

167 When the ways of man shall please the Lord he will convert even
his enemies to peace

168 Better is a little with justice than great revenues with
iniquity

169 The heart of man disposeth his way but the Lord must direct his
steps

1610 Divination is in the lips of the king his mouth shall not err
in judgment

1611 Weight and balance are judgments of the Lord and his work all
the weights of the bag

1612 They that act wickedly are abominable to the king for the
throne is established by justice

1613 Just lips are the delight of kings he that speaketh right
things shall be loved

1614 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death and the wise man
will pacify it

1615 In the cheerfulness of the kings countenance is life and his
clemency is like the latter rain

1616 Get wisdom because it is better than gold and purchase
prudence for it is more precious than silver

1617 The path of the just departeth from evils he that keepeth his
soul keepeth his way

1618 Pride goeth before destruction and the spirit is lifted up
before a fall

1619 It is better to be humbled with the meek than to divide spoils
with the proud

1620 The learned in word shall find good things and he that trusteth
in the Lord is blessed

1621 The wise in heart shall be called prudent and he that is sweet
in words shall attain to greater things

1622 Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it the
instruction of fools is foolishness

1623 The heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth and shall add
grace to his lips

1624 Well ordered words are as a honeycomb sweet to the soul and
health to the bones

1625 There is a way that seemeth to a man right and the ends thereof
lead to death

1626 The soul of him that laboureth laboureth for himself because
his mouth hath obliged him to it

1627 The wicked man diggeth evil and in his lips is a burning fire

1628 A perverse man stirreth up quarrels and one full of words
separateth princes

1629 An unjust man allureth his friend and leadeth him into a way
that is not good

1630 He that with fixed eyes deviseth wicked things biting his lips
bringeth evil to pass

1631 Old age is a crown of dignity when it is found in the ways of
justice

1632 The patient man is better than the valiant and he that ruleth
his spirit than he that taketh cities

1633 Lots are cast into the lap but they are disposed of by the
Lord



Proverbs Chapter 17


171 Better is a dry morsel with joy than a house full of victims
with strife

172 A wise servant shall rule over foolish sons and shall divide the
inheritance among the brethren

173 As silver is tried by fire and gold in the furnace so the Lord
trieth the hearts

174 The evil man obeyeth an unjust tongue and the deceitful
hearkeneth to lying lips

175 He that despiseth the poor reproacheth his maker and he that
rejoiceth at another mans ruin shall not be unpunished

176 Childrens children are the crown of old men and the glory of
children are their fathers

177 Eloquent words do not become a fool nor lying lips a prince

178 The expectation of him that expecteth is a most acceptable jewel
whithersoever he turneth himself he understandeth wisely

179 He that concealeth a transgression seeketh friendships he that
repeateth it again separateth friends

1710 A reproof availeth more with a wise man than a hundred stripes
with a fool

1711 An evil man always seeketh quarrels but a cruel angel shall be
sent against him

1712 It is better to meet a bear robbed of her whelps than a fool
trusting in his own folly

1713 He that rendereth evil for good evil shall not depart from his
house

1714 The beginning of quarrels is as when one letteth out water and
before he suffereth reproach he forsaketh judgment

1715 He that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just
both are abominable before God

1716 What doth it avail a fool to have riches seeing he cannot buy
wisdom He that maketh his house high seeketh a downfall and he that
refuseth to learn shall fall into evils

1717 He that is a friend loveth at all times and a brother is proved
in distress

1718 A foolish man will clap hands when he is surety for his friend

1719 He that studieth discords loveth quarrels and he that exalteth
his door seeketh ruin

1720 He that is of a perverse heart shall not find good and he that
perverteth his tongue shall fall into evil

1721 A fool is born to his own disgrace and even his father shall
not rejoice in a fool

1722 A joyful mind maketh age flourishing a sorrowful spirit drieth
up the bones

1723 The wicked man taketh gifts out of the bosom that he may
pervert the paths of judgment

1724 Wisdom shineth in the face of the wise the eyes of fools are in
the ends of the earth

1725 A foolish son is the anger of the father and the sorrow of the
mother that bore him

1726 It is no good thing to do hurt to the just nor to strike the
prince who judgeth right

1727 He that setteth bounds to his words is knowing and wise and
the man of understanding is of a precious spirit

1728 Even a fool if he will hold his peace shall be counted wise
and if he close his lips a man of understanding



Proverbs Chapter 18


181 He that hath a mind to depart from a friend seeketh occasions
he shall ever be subject to reproach

182 A fool receiveth not the words of prudence unless thou say those
things which are in his heart

183 The wicked man when he is come into the depths of sins
contemneth but ignominy and reproach follow him

184 Words from the mouth of a man are as deep water and the fountain
of wisdom is an overflowing stream

185 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked to decline
from the truth of judgment

186 The lips of a fool intermeddle with strife and his mouth
provoketh quarrels

187 The mouth of a fool is his destruction and his lips are the ruin
of his soul

188 The words of the double tongued are as if they were harmless and
they reach even to the inner parts of the bowels Fear casteth down the
slothful and the souls of the effeminate shall be hungry

189 He that is loose and slack in his work is the brother of him
that wasteth his own works

1810 The name of the Lord is a strong tower the just runneth to it
and shall be exalted

1811 The substance of the rich man is the city of his strength and
as a strong wall compassing him about

1812 Before destruction the heart of a man is exalted and before he
be glorified it is humbled

1813 He that answereth before he heareth sheweth himself to be a
fool and worthy of confusion

1814 The spirit of a man upholdeth his infirmity but a spirit that
is easily angered who can bear

1815 A wise heart shall acquire knowledge and the ear of the wise
seeketh instruction

1816 A mans gift enlargeth his way and maketh him room before
princes

1817 The just is first accuser of himself his friend cometh and
shall search him

1818 The lot suppresseth contentions and determineth even between
the mighty

1819 A brother that is helped by his brother is like a strong city
and judgments are like the bars of cities

1820 Of the fruit of a mans mouth shall his belly be satisfied and
the offspring of his lips shall fill him

1821 Death and life are in the power of the tongue they that love
it shall eat the fruits thereof

1822 He that hath found a good wife hath found a good thing and
shall receive a pleasure from the Lord He that driveth away a good
wife driveth away a good thing but he that keepeth an adulteress is
foolish and wicked

1823 The poor will speak with supplications and the rich will speak
roughly

1824 A man amiable in society shall be more friendly than a brother



Proverbs Chapter 19


191 Better is the poor man that walketh in his simplicity than a
rich man that is perverse in his lips and unwise

192 Where there is no knowledge of the soul there is no good and he
that is hasty with his feet shall stumble

193 The folly of a man supplanteth his steps and he fretteth in his
mind against God

194 Riches make many friends but from the poor man even they whom
he had depart

195 A false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh
lies shall not escape

196 Many honour the person of him that is mighty and are friends of
him that giveth gifts

197 The brethren of the poor man hate him moreover also his friends
have departed far from him He that followeth after words only shall
have nothing

198 But he that possesseth a mind loveth his own soul and he that
keepeth prudence shall find good things

199 A false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh
lies shall perish

1910 Delicacies are not seemly for a fool nor for a servant to have
rule over princes

1911 The learning of a man is known by patience and his glory is to
pass over wrongs

1912 As the roaring of a lion so also is the anger of a king and
his cheerfulness as the dew upon the grass

1913 A foolish son is the grief of his father and a wrangling wife
is like a roof continually dropping through

1914 House and riches are given by parents but a prudent wife is
properly from the Lord

1915 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and an idle soul shall
suffer hunger

1916 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul but he
that neglecteth his own way shall die

1917 He that hath mercy on the poor lendeth to the Lord and he will
repay him

1918 Chastise thy son despair not but to the killing of him set not
thy soul

1919 He that is impatient shall suffer damage and when he shall
take away he shall add another thing

1920 Hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayst be wise
in thy latter end

1921 There are many thoughts in the heart of a man but the will of
the Lord shall stand firm

1922 A needy man is merciful and better is the poor than the lying
man

1923 The fear of the Lord is unto life and he shall abide in the
fulness without being visited with evil

1924 The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit and will not so
much as bring it to his mouth

1925 The wicked man being scourged the fool shall be wiser but if
thou rebuke a wise man he will understand discipline

1926 He that afflicteth his father and chaseth away his mother is
infamous and unhappy

1927 Cease not O my son to hear instruction and be not ignorant of
the words of knowledge

1928 An unjust witness scorneth judgment and the mouth of the wicked
devoureth iniquity

1929 Judgments are prepared for scorners and striking hammers for
the bodies of fools



Proverbs Chapter 20


201 Wine is a luxurious thing and drunkenness riotous whosoever is
delighted therewith shall not be wise

202 As the roaring of a lion so also is the dread of a king he that
provoketh him sinneth against his own soul

203 It is an honour for a man to separate himself from quarrels but
all fools are meddling with reproaches

204 Because of the cold the sluggard would not plough he shall beg
therefore in the summer and it shall not be given him

205 Counsel in the heart of a man is like deep water but a wise man
will draw it out

206 Many men are called merciful but who shall find a faithful man

207 The just that walketh in his simplicity shall leave behind him
blessed children

208 The king that sitteth on the throne of judgment scattereth away
all evil with his look

209 Who can say My heart is clean I am pure from sin

2010 Diverse weights and diverse measures both are abominable before
God

2011 By his inclinations a child is known if his works be clean and
right

2012 The hearing ear and the seeing eye the Lord hath made them
both

2013 Love not sleep lest poverty oppress thee open thy eyes and be
filled with bread

2014 It is naught it is naught saith every buyer and when he is
gone away then he will boast

2015 There is gold and a multitude of jewels but the lips of
knowledge are a precious vessel

2016 Take away the garment of him that is surety for a stranger and
take a pledge from him for strangers

2017 The bread of lying is sweet to a man but afterwards his mouth
shall be filled with gravel

2018 Designs are strengthened by counsels and wars are to be managed
by governments

2019 Meddle not with him that revealeth secrets and walketh
deceitfully and openeth wide his lips

2020 He that curseth his father and mother his lamp shall be put
out in the midst of darkness

2021 The inheritance gotten hastily in the beginning in the end
shall be without a blessing

2022 Say not I will return evil wait for the Lord and he will
deliver thee

2023 Diverse weights are an abomination before the Lord a deceitful
balance is not good

2024 The steps of men are guided by the Lord but who is the man that
can understand his own way

2025 It is ruin to a man to devour holy ones and after vows to
retract

2026 A wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth over them the
wheel

2027 The spirit of a man is the lamp of the Lord which searcheth all
the hidden things of the bowels

2028 Mercy and truth preserve the king and his throne is
strengthened by clemency

2029 The joy of young men is their strength and the dignity of old
men their grey hairs

2030 The blueness of a wound shall wipe away evils and stripes in
the more inward parts of the belly



Proverbs Chapter 21


211 As the divisions of waters so the heart of the king is in the
hand of the Lord whithersoever he will he shall turn it

212 Every way of a man seemeth right to himself but the Lord
weigheth the hearts

213 To do mercy and judgment pleaseth the Lord more than victims

214 Haughtiness of the eyes is the enlarging of the heart the lamp
of the wicked is sin

215 The thoughts of the industrious always bring forth abundance but
every sluggard is always in want

216 He that gathereth treasures by a lying tongue is vain and
foolish and shall stumble upon the snares of death

217 The robberies of the wicked shall be their downfall because they
would not do judgment

218 The perverse way of a man is strange but as for him that is
pure his work is right

219 It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop than with a
brawling woman and in a common house

2110 The soul of the wicked desireth evil he will not have pity on
his neighbour

2111 When a pestilent man is punished the little one will be wiser
and if he follow the wise he will receive knowledge

2112 The just considereth seriously the house of the wicked that he
may withdraw the wicked from evil

2113 He that stoppeth his ear against the cry of the poor shall also
cry himself and shall not be heard

2114 A secret present quencheth anger and a gift in the bosom the
greatest wrath

2115 It is joy to the just to do judgment and dread to them that
work iniquity

2116 A man that shall wander out of the way of doctrine shall abide
in the company of the giants

2117 He that loveth good cheer shall be in want he that loveth
wine and fat things shall not be rich

2118 The wicked is delivered up for the just and the unjust for the
righteous

2119 It is better to dwell in a wilderness than with a quarrelsome
and passionate woman

2120 There is a treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of
the just and the foolish man shall spend it

2121 He that followeth justice and mercy shall find life justice
and glory

2122 The wise man hath scaled the city of the strong and hath cast
down the strength of the confidence thereof

2123 He that keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
distress

2124 The proud and the arrogant is called ignorant who in anger
worketh pride

2125 Desires kill the slothful for his hands have refused to work at
all

2126 He longeth and desireth all the day but he that is just will
give and will not cease

2127 The sacrifices of the wicked are abominable because they are
offered of wickedness

2128 A lying witness shall perish an obedient man shall speak of
victory

2129 The wicked man impudently hardeneth his face but he that is
righteous correcteth his way

2130 There is no wisdom there is no prudence there is no counsel
against the Lord

2131 The horse is prepared for the day of battle but the Lord giveth
safety



Proverbs Chapter 22


221 A good name is better than great riches and good favour is above
silver and gold

222 The rich and poor have met one another the Lord is the maker of
them both

223 The prudent man saw the evil and hid himself the simple passed
on and suffered loss

224 The fruit of humility is the fear of the Lord riches and glory
and life

225 Arms and swords are in the way of the perverse but he that
keepeth his own soul departeth far from them

226 It is a proverb A young man according to his way even when he
is old he will not depart from it

227 The rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to him
that lendeth

228 He that soweth iniquity shall reap evils and with the rod of
his anger he shall be consumed

229 He that is inclined to mercy shall be blessed for of his bread
he hath given to the poor He that maketh presents shall purchase
victory and honour but he carrieth away the souls of the receivers

2210 Cast out the scoffer and contention shall go out with him and
quarrels and reproaches shall cease

2211 He that loveth cleanness of heart for the grace of his lips
shall have the king for his friend

2212 The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge and the words of the
unjust are overthrown

2213 The slothful man saith There is a lion without I shall be
slain in the midst of the streets

2214 The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit he whom the Lord is
angry with shall fall into it

2215 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child and the rod of
correction shall drive it away

2216 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his own riches shall
himself give to one that is richer and shall be in need

2217 Incline thy ear and hear the words of the wise and apply thy
heart to my doctrine

2218 Which shall be beautiful for thee if thou keep it in thy
bowels and it shall flow in thy lips

2219 That thy trust may be in the Lord wherefore I have also shewn
it to thee this day

2220 Behold I have described it to thee three manner of ways in
thoughts and knowledge

2221 That I might shew thee the certainty and the words of truth to
answer out of these to them that sent thee

2222 Do no violence to the poor because he is poor and do not
oppress the needy in the gate

2223 Because the Lord will judge his cause and will afflict them
that have afflicted his soul

2224 Be not a friend to an angry man and do not walk with a furious
man

2225 Lest perhaps thou learn his ways and take scandal to thy soul

2226 Be not with them that fasten down their hands and that offer
themselves sureties for debts

2227 For if thou have not wherewith to restore what cause is there
that he should take the covering from thy bed

2228 Pass not beyond the ancient bounds which thy fathers have set

2229 Hast thou seen a man swift in his work he shall stand before
kings and shall not be before those that are obscure



Proverbs Chapter 23


231 When thou shalt sit to eat with a prince consider diligently
what is set before thy face

232 And put a knife to thy throat if it be so that thou have thy
soul in thy own power

233 Be not desirous of his meats in which is the bread of deceit

234 Labour not to be rich but set bounds to thy prudence

235 Lift not up thy eyes to riches which thou canst not have because
they shall make themselves wings like those of an eagle and shall fly
towards heaven

236 Eat not with an envious man and desire not his meats

237 Because like a soothsayer and diviner he thinketh that which
he knoweth not Eat and drink will he say to thee and his mind is not
with thee

238 The meats which thou hadst eaten thou shalt vomit up and shalt
loose thy beautiful words

239 Speak not in the ears of fools because they will despise the
instruction of thy speech

2310 Touch not the bounds of little ones and enter not into the
field of the fatherless

2311 For their near kinsman is strong and he will judge their cause
against thee

2312 Let thy heart apply itself to instruction and thy ears to words
of knowledge

2313 Withhold not correction from a child for if thou strike him
with the rod he shall not die

2314 Thou shalt beat him with the rod and deliver his soul from
hell

2315 My son if thy mind be wise my heart shall rejoice with thee

2316 And my reins shall rejoice when thy lips shall speak what is
right

2317 Let not thy heart envy sinners but be thou in the fear of the
Lord all the day long

2318 Because thou shalt have hope in the latter end and thy
expectation shall not be taken away

2319 Hear thou my son and be wise and guide thy mind in the way

2320 Be not in the feasts of great drinkers nor in their revellings
who contribute flesh to eat

2321 Because they that give themselves to drinking and that club
together shall be consumed and drowsiness shall be clothed with rags

2322 Hearken to thy father that begot thee and despise not thy
mother when she is old

2323 Buy truth and do not sell wisdom and instruction and
understanding

2324 The father of the just rejoiceth greatly he that hath begotten
a wise son shall have joy in him

2325 Let thy father and thy mother be joyful and let her rejoice
that bore thee

2326 My son give me thy heart and let thy eyes keep my ways

2327 For a harlot is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow
pit

2328 She lieth in wait in the way as a robber and him whom she shall
see unwary she will kill

2329 Who hath woe whose father hath woe who hath contentions who
falls into pits who hath wounds without cause who hath redness of
eyes

2330 Surely they that pass their time in wine and study to drink off
their cups

2331 Look not upon the wine when it is yellow when the colour
thereof shineth in the glass it goeth in pleasantly

2332 But in the end it will bite like a snake and will spread
abroad poison like a basilisk

2333 Thy eyes shall behold strange women and thy heart shall utter
perverse things

2334 And thou shalt be as one sleeping in the midst of the sea and
as a pilot fast asleep when the stern is lost

2335 And thou shalt say They have beaten me but I was not sensible
of pain they drew me and I felt not when shall I awake and find wine
again



Proverbs Chapter 24


241 Seek not to be like evil men neither desire to be with them

242 Because their mind studieth robberies and their lips speak
deceits

243 By wisdom the house shall be built and by prudence it shall be
strengthened

244 By instruction the storerooms shall be filled with all precious
and most beautiful wealth

245 A wise man is strong and a knowing man stout and valiant

246 Because war is managed by due ordering and there shall be safety
where there are many counsels

247 Wisdom is too high for a fool in the gate he shall not open his
mouth

248 He that deviseth to do evils shall be called a fool

249 The thought of a fool is sin and the detractor is the
abomination of men

2410 If thou lose hope being weary in the day of distress thy
strength shall be diminished

2411 Deliver them that are led to death and those that are drawn to
death forbear not to deliver

2412 If thou say I have not strength enough he that seeth into the
heart he understandeth and nothing deceiveth the keeper of thy soul
and he shall render to a man according to his works

2413 Eat honey my son because it is good and the honeycomb most
sweet to thy throat

2414 So also is the doctrine of wisdom to thy soul which when thou
hast found thou shalt have hope in the end and thy hope shall not
perish

2415 Lie not in wait nor seek after wickedness in the house of the
just nor spoil his rest

2416 For a just man shall fall seven times and shall rise again but
the wicked shall fall down into evil

2417 When thy enemy shall fall be not glad and in his ruin let not
thy heart rejoice

2418 Lest the Lord see and it displease him and he turn away his
wrath from him

2419 Contend not with the wicked nor seek to be like the ungodly

2420 For evil men have no hope of things to come and the lamp of the
wicked shall be put out

2421 My son fear the Lord and the king and have nothing to do with
detractors

2422 For their destruction shall rise suddenly and who knoweth the
ruin of both

2423 These things also to the wise It is not good to have respect to
persons in judgment

2424 They that say to the wicked man Thou art just shall be cursed
by the people and the tribes shall abhor them

2425 They that rebuke him shall be praised and a blessing shall come
upon them

2426 He shall kiss the lips who answereth right words

2427 Prepare thy work without and diligently till thy ground that
afterward thou mayst build thy house

2428 Be not witness without cause against thy neighbour and deceive
not any man with thy lips

2429 Say not I will do to him as he hath done to me I will render
to every one according to his work

2430 I passed by the field of the slothful man and by the vineyard
of the foolish man

2431 And behold it was all filled with nettles and thorns had
covered the face thereof and the stone wall was broken down

2432 Which when I had seen I laid it up in my heart and by the
example I received instruction

2433 Thou wilt sleep a little said I thou wilt slumber a little
thou wilt fold thy hands a little to rest

2434 And poverty shall come to thee as a runner and beggary as an
armed man



Proverbs Chapter 25


251 These are also parables of Solomon which the men of Ezechias
king of Juda copied out

252 It is the glory of God to conceal the word and the glory of
kings to search out the speech

253 The heaven above and the earth beneath and the heart of kings is
unsearchable

254 Take away the rust from silver and there shall come forth a most
pure vessel

255 Take away wickedness from the face of the king and his throne
shall be established with justice

256 Appear not glorious before the king and stand not in the place
of great men

257 For it is better that it should be said to thee Come up hither
than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince

258 The things which thy eyes have seen utter not hastily in a
quarrel lest afterward thou mayst not be able to make amends when
thou hast dishonoured thy friend

259 Treat thy cause with thy friend and discover not the secret to a
stranger

2510 Lest he insult over thee when he hath heard it and cease not
to upbraid thee Grace and friendship deliver a man keep these for
thyself lest thou fall under reproach

2511 To speak a word in due time is like apples of gold on beds of
silver

2512 As an earring of gold and a bright pearl so is he that
reproveth the wise and the obedient ear

2513 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest so is a faithful
messenger to him that sent him for he refresheth his soul

2514 As clouds and wind when no rain followeth so is the man that
boasteth and doth not fulfil his promises

2515 By patience a prince shall be appeased and a soft tongue shall
break hardness

2516 Thou hast found honey eat what is sufficient for thee lest
being glutted therewith thou vomit it up

2517 Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour lest having
his fill he hate thee

2518 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is like
a dart and a sword and a sharp arrow

2519 To trust in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble is like a
rotten tooth and weary foot

2520 And one that looseth his garment in cold weather As vinegar
upon nitre so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart As a moth
doth by a garment and a worm by the wood so the sadness of a man
consumeth the heart

2521 If thy enemy be hungry give him to eat if he thirst give him
water to drink

2522 For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head and the Lord will
reward thee

2523 The north wind driveth away rain as doth a sad countenance a
backbiting tongue

2524 It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop than with a
brawling woman and in a common house

2525 As cold water to a thirsty soul so are good tidings from a far
country

2526 A just man falling down before the wicked is as a fountain
troubled with the foot and a corrupted spring

2527 As it is not good for a man to eat much honey so he that is a
searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory

Majesty  Viz of God For to search into that incomprehensible
Majesty and to pretend to sound the depths of the wisdom of God is
exposing our weak understanding to be blinded with an excess of light
and glory which it cannot comprehend

2528 As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls so is
a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking



Proverbs Chapter 26


261 As snow in summer and rain in harvest so glory is not seemly
for a fool

262 As a bird flying to other places and a sparrow going here or
there so a curse uttered without cause shall come upon a man

As a bird etc  The meaning is that a curse uttered without cause
shall do no harm to the person that is cursed but will return upon him
that curseth as whithersoever a bird flies it returns to its own
nest

263 A whip for a horse and a snaffle for an ass and a rod for the
back of fools

264 Answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou be made like
him

Answer not a fool etc  Viz so as to imitate him but only so as to
reprove his folly

265 Answer a fool according to his folly lest he imagine himself to
be wise

266 He that sendeth words by a foolish messenger is lame of feet and
drinketh iniquity

267 As a lame man hath fair legs in vain so a parable is unseemly in
the mouth of fools

268 As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury so is he
that giveth honour to a fool

269 As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard so is a
parable in the mouth of fools

2610 Judgment determineth causes and he that putteth a fool to
silence appeaseth anger

2611 As a dog that returneth to his vomit so is the fool that
repeateth his folly

2612 Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit there shall be
more hope of a fool than of him

2613 The slothful man saith There is a lion in the way and a
lioness in the roads

2614 As the door turneth upon its hinges so doth the slothful upon
his bed

2615 The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit and it grieveth
him to turn it to his mouth

2616 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that
speak sentences

2617 As he that taketh a dog by the ears so is he that passeth by in
anger and meddleth with another mans quarrel

2618 As he is guilty that shooteth arrows and lances unto death

2619 So is the man that hurteth his friend deceitfully and when he
is taken saith I did it in jest

2620 When the wood faileth the fire shall go out and when the
talebearer is taken away contentions shall cease

2621 As coals are to burning coals and wood to fire so an angry man
stirreth up strife

2622 The words of a talebearer are as it were simple but they reach
to the innermost parts of the belly

2623 Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart are like an earthern
vessel adorned with silver dross

2624 An enemy is known by his lips when in his heart he entertaineth
deceit

2625 When he shall speak low trust him not because there are seven
mischiefs in his heart

2626 He that covereth hatred deceitfully his malice shall be laid
open in the public assembly

2627 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and he that rolleth a
stone it shall return to him

2628 A deceitful tongue loveth not truth and a slippery mouth
worketh ruin



Proverbs Chapter 27


271 Boast not for to morrow for thou knowest not what the day to
come may bring forth

272 Let another praise thee and not thy own mouth a stranger and
not thy own lips

273 A stone is heavy and sand weighty but the anger of a fool is
heavier than them both

274 Anger hath no mercy nor fury when it breaketh forth and who
can bear the violence of one provoked

275 Open rebuke is better than hidden love

276 Better are the wounds of a friend than the deceitful kisses of
an enemy

277 A soul that is full shall tread upon the honeycomb and a soul
that is hungry shall take even bitter for sweet

278 As a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that leaveth
his place

279 Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart and the good counsels of
a friend are sweet to the soul

2710 Thy own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not and go not
into thy brothers house in the day of thy affliction Better is a
neighbour that is near than a brother afar off

2711 Study wisdom my son and make my heart joyful that thou mayst
give an answer to him that reproacheth

2712 The prudent man seeing evil hideth himself little ones passing
on have suffered losses

2713 Take away his garment that hath been surety for a stranger and
take from him a pledge for strangers

2714 He that blesseth his neighbour with a loud voice rising in the
night shall be like to him that curseth

2715 Roofs dropping through in a cold day and a contentious woman
are alike

2716 He that retaineth her is as he that would hold the wind and
shall call the oil of his right hand

2717 Iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend

2718 He that keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof and
he that is the keeper of his master shall be glorified

2719 As the faces of them that look therein shine in the water so
the hearts of men are laid open to the wise

2720 Hell and destruction are never filled so the eyes of men are
never satisfied

2721 As silver is tried in the finingpot and gold in the furnace
so a man is tried by the mouth of him that praiseth The heart of the
wicked seeketh after evils but the righteous heart seeketh after
knowledge

2722 Though thou shouldst bray a fool in the mortar as when a pestle
striketh upon sodden barley his folly would not be taken from him

2723 Be diligent to know the countenance of thy cattle and consider
thy own flocks

2724 For thou shalt not always have power but a crown shall be given
to generation and generation

2725 The meadows are open and the green herbs have appeared and the
hay is gathered out of the mountains

2726 Lambs are for thy clothing and kids for the price of the field

2727 Let the milk of the goats be enough for thy food and for the
necessities of thy house and for maintenance for thy handmaids



Proverbs Chapter 28


281 The wicked man fleeth when no man pursueth but the just bold
as a lion shall be without dread

282 For the sins of the land many are the princes thereof and for
the wisdom of a man and the knowledge of those things that are said
the life of the prince shall be prolonged

283 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a violent shower
which bringeth a famine

284 They that forsake the law praise the wicked man they that keep
it are incensed against him

285 Evil men think not on judgment but they that seek after the
Lord take notice of all things

286 Better is the poor man walking in his simplicity than the rich
in crooked ways

287 He that keepeth the law is a wise son but he that feedeth
gluttons shameth his father

288 He that heapeth together riches by usury and loan gathereth them
for him that will be bountiful to the poor

289 He that turneth away his ears from hearing the law his prayer
shall be an abomination

2810 He that deceiveth the just in a wicked way shall fall in his
own destruction and the upright shall possess his goods

2811 The rich man seemeth to himself wise but the poor man that is
prudent shall search him out

2812 In the joy of the just there is great glory when the wicked
reign men are ruined

2813 He that hideth his sins shall not prosper but he that shall
confess and forsake them shall obtain mercy

2814 Blessed is the man that is always fearful but he that is
hardened in mind shall fall into evil

2815 As a roaring lion and a hungry bear so is a wicked prince over
the poor people

2816 A prince void of prudence shall oppress many by calumny but he
that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days

2817 A man that doth violence to the blood of a person if he flee
even to the pit no man will stay him

2818 He that walketh uprightly shall be saved he that is perverse
in his ways shall fall at once

2819 He that tilleth his ground shall be filled with bread but he
that followeth idleness shall be filled with poverty

2820 A faithful man shall be much praised but he that maketh haste
to be rich shall not be innocent

2821 He that hath respect to a person in judgment doth not well
such a man even for a morsel of bread forsaketh the truth

2822 A man that maketh haste to be rich and envieth others is
ignorant that poverty shall come upon him

2823 He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find favour with him
more than he that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him

2824 He that stealeth any thing from his father or from his mother
and saith This is no sin is the partner of a murderer

2826 He that boasteth and puffeth up himself stirreth up quarrels
but he that trusteth in the Lord shall be healed

2826 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but he that
walketh wisely he shall be saved

2827 He that giveth to the poor shall not want he that despiseth his
entreaty shall suffer indigence

2828 When the wicked rise up men shall hide themselves when they
perish the just shall be multiplied



Proverbs Chapter 29


291 The man that with a stiff neck despiseth him that reproveth him
shall suddenly be destroyed and health shall not follow him

292 When just men increase the people shall rejoice when the wicked
shall bear rule the people shall mourn

293 A man that loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father but he that
maintaineth harlots shall squander away his substance

294 A just king setteth up the land a covetous man shall destroy it

295 A man that speaketh to his friend with flattering and dissembling
words spreadeth a net for his feet

296 A snare shall entangle the wicked man when he sinneth and the
just shall praise and rejoice

297 The just taketh notice of the cause of the poor the wicked is
void of knowledge

298 Corrupt men bring a city to ruin but wise men turn away wrath

299 If a wise man contend with a fool whether he be angry or laugh
he shall find no rest

2910 Bloodthirsty men hate the upright but just men seek his soul

2911 A fool uttereth all his mind a wise man deferreth and keepeth
it till afterwards

2912 A prince that gladly heareth lying words hath all his servants
wicked

2913 The poor man and the creditor have met one another the Lord is
the enlightener of them both

2914 The king that judgeth the poor in truth his throne shall be
established for ever

2915 The rod and reproof give wisdom but the child that is left to
his own will bringeth his mother to shame

2916 When the wicked are multiplied crimes shall be multiplied but
the just shall see their downfall

2917 Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give
delight to thy soul

2918 When prophecy shall fail the people shall be scattered abroad
but he that keepeth the law is blessed

2919 A slave will not be corrected by words because he understandeth
what thou sayest and will not answer

2920 Hast thou seen a man hasty to speak folly is rather to be
looked for than his amendment

2921 He that nourisheth his servant delicately from his childhood
afterwards shall find him stubborn

2922 A passionate man provoketh quarrels and he that is easily
stirred up to wrath shall be more prone to sin

2923 Humiliation followeth the proud and glory shall uphold the
humble of spirit

2924 He that is partaker with a thief hateth his own soul he
heareth one putting him to his oath and discovereth not

2925 He that feareth man shall quickly fall he that trusteth in the
Lord shall be set on high

2926 Many seek the face of the prince but the judgment of every one
cometh forth from the Lord

2927 The just abhor a wicked man and the wicked loathe them that are
in the right way The son that keepeth the word shall be free from
destruction



Proverbs Chapter 30


The wise man thinketh humbly of himself His prayer and sentiments upon
certain virtues and vices

301 The words of Gatherer the son of Vomiter The vision which the
man spoke with whom God is and who being strengthened by God abiding
with him said

Gatherer etc  Or as it is in the Latin Congregans the son of
Vomens The Latin interpreter has given us in this place the
signification of the Hebrew names instead of the names themselves
which are in the Hebrew Agur the son of Jakeh But whether this Agur
be the same person as Solomon as many think or a different person
whose doctrine was adopted by Solomon and inserted among his parables
or proverbs is uncertain

302 I am the most foolish of men and the wisdom of men is not with
me

303 I have not learned wisdom and have not known the science of
saints

304 Who hath ascended up into heaven and descended who hath held
the wind in his hands who hath bound up the waters together as in a
garment who hath raised up all the borders of the earth what is his
name and what is the name of his son if thou knowest

305 Every word of God is fire tried he is a buckler to them that
hope in him

Is fire tried  That is most pure like gold purified by fire

306 Add not any thing to his words lest thou be reproved and found a
liar

307 Two things I have asked of thee deny them not to me before I
die

308 Remove far from me vanity and lying words Give me neither
beggary nor riches give me only the necessaries of life

309 Lest perhaps being filled I should be tempted to deny and say
Who is the Lord or being compelled by poverty I should steal and
forswear the name of my God

3010 Accuse not a servant to his master lest he curse thee and thou
fall

3011 There is a generation that curseth their father and doth not
bless their mother

3012 A generation that are pure in their own eyes and yet are not
washed from their filthiness

3013 A generation whose eyes are lofty and their eyelids lifted up
on high

3014 A generation that for teeth hath swords and grindeth with their
jaw teeth to devour the needy from off the earth and the poor from
among men

3015 The horseleech hath two daughters that say Bring bring There
are three things that never are satisfied and the fourth never saith
It is enough

The horseleech  Concupiscence which hath two daughters that are
never satisfied viz lust and avarice

3016 Hell and the mouth of the womb and the earth which is not
satisfied with water and the fire never saith It is enough

3017 The eye that mocketh at his father and that despiseth the
labour of his mother in bearing him let the ravens of the brooks pick
it out and the young eagles eat it

3018 Three things are hard to me and the fourth I am utterly
ignorant of

3019 The way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a
rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man
in youth

3020 Such also is the way of an adulterous woman who eateth and
wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no evil

3021 By three things the earth is disturbed and the fourth it cannot
bear

3022 By a slave when he reigneth by a fool when be is filled with
meat

3023 By an odious woman when she is married and by a bondwoman when
she is heir to her mistress

3024 There are four very little things of the earth and they are
wiser than the wise

3025 The ants a feeble people which provide themselves food in the
harvest

3026 The rabbit a weak people which maketh its bed in the rock

3027 The locust hath no king yet they all go out by their bands

3028 The stellio supporteth itself on hands and dwelleth in kings
houses

The stellio  A kind of house lizard marked with spots like stars
from whence it has its name

3019 There are three things which go well and the fourth that
walketh happily

3030 A lion the strongest of beasts who hath no fear of any thing
he meeteth

3031 A cock girded about the loins and a ram and a king whom none
can resist

3032 There is that hath appeared a fool after he was lifted up on
high for if he had understood he would have laid his hand upon his
mouth

3033 And he that strongly squeezeth the paps to bring out milk
straineth out butter and he that violently bloweth his nose bringeth
out blood and he that provoketh wrath bringeth forth strife



Proverbs Chapter 31


An exhortation to chastity temperance and works of mercy with the
praise of a wise woman

311 The words of king Lamuel The vision wherewith his mother
instructed him

Lamuel  This name signifies God with him and is supposed to have
been one of the names of Solomon

312 What O my beloved what O the beloved of my womb what O the
beloved of my vows

313 Give not thy substance to women and thy riches to destroy kings

314 Give not to kings O Lamuel give not wine to kings because
there is no secret where drunkenness reigneth

315 And lest they drink and forget judgments and pervert the cause
of the children of the poor

316 Give strong drink to them that are sad and wine to them that are
grieved in mind

317 Let them drink and forget their want and remember their sorrow
no more

318 Open thy mouth for the dumb and for the causes of all the
children that pass

319 Open thy mouth decree that which is just and do justice to the
needy and poor

3110 Who shall find a valiant woman far and from the uttermost
coasts is the price of her

3111 The heart of her husband trusteth in her and he shall have no
need of spoils

3112 She will render him good and not evil all the days of her life

3113 She hath sought wool and flax and hath wrought by the counsel
of her hands

3114 She is like the merchants ship she bringeth her bread from
afar

3115 And she hath risen in the night and given a prey to her
household and victuals to her maidens

3116 She hath considered a field and bought it with the fruit of
her hands she hath planted a vineyard

3117 She hath girded her loins with strength and hath strengthened
her arm

3118 She hath tasted and seen that her traffic is good her lamp
shall not be put out in the night

3119 She hath put out her hand to strong things and her fingers have
taken hold of the spindle

3120 She hath opened her hand to the needy and stretched out her
hands to the poor

3121 She shall not fear for her house in the cold of snow for all
her domestics are clothed with double garments

3122 She hath made for herself clothing of tapestry fine linen and
purple is her covering

3123 Her husband is honourable in the gates when he sitteth among
the senators of the land

3124 She made fine linen and sold it and delivered a girdle to the
Chanaanite

The Chanaanite  The merchant for Chanaanite in Hebrew signifies a
merchant

3125 Strength and beauty are her clothing and she shall laugh in the
latter day

3126 She hath opened her mouth to wisdom and the law of clemency is
on her tongue

3127 She hath looked well on the paths of her house and hath not
eaten her bread idle

3128 Her children rose up and called her blessed her husband and
he praised her

3129 Many daughters have gathered together riches thou hast
surpassed them all

3130 Favour is deceitful and beauty is vain the woman that feareth
the Lord she shall be praised

3131 Give her of the fruit of her hands and let her works praise her
in the gates




ECCLESIASTES



This Book is called Ecclesiastes or The Preacher in Hebrew
Coheleth because in it Solomon as an excellent preacher setteth
forth the vanity of the things of this world to withdraw the hearts
and affections of men from such empty toys



Ecclesiastes Chapter 1


The vanity of all temporal things

11 The words of Ecclesiastes the son of David king of Jerusalem

12 Vanity of vanities said Ecclesiastes vanity of vanities and all
is vanity

13 What hath a man more of all his labour that he taketh under the
sun

14 One generation passeth away and another generation cometh but
the earth standeth for ever

15 The sun riseth and goeth down and returneth to his place and
there rising again

16 Maketh his round by the south and turneth again to the north the
spirit goeth forward surveying all places round about and returneth to
his circuits

17 All the rivers run into the sea yet the sea doth not overflow
unto the place from whence the rivers come they return to flow again

18 All things are hard man cannot explain them by word The eye is
not filled with seeing neither is the ear filled with hearing

19 What is it that hath been the same thing that shall be What is
it that hath been done the same that shall be done

110 Nothing under the sun is new neither is any man able to say
Behold this is new for it hath already gone before in the ages that
were before us

111 There is no remembrance of former things nor indeed of those
things which hereafter are to come shall there be any remembrance with
them that shall be in the latter end

112 I Ecclesiastes was king over Israel in Jerusalem

113 And I proposed in my mind to seek and search out wisely
concerning all things that are done under the sun This painful
occupation hath God given to the children of men to be exercised
therein

114 I have seen all things that are done under the sun and behold
all is vanity and vexation of spirit

115 The perverse are hard to be corrected and the number of fools is
infinite

116 I have spoken in my heart saying Behold I am become great and
have gone beyond all in wisdom that were before me in Jerusalem and
my mind hath contemplated many things wisely and I have learned

117 And I have given my heart to know prudence and learning and
errors and folly and I have perceived that in these also there was
labour and vexation of spirit

118 Because in much wisdom there is much indignation and he that
addeth knowledge addeth also labour



Ecclesiastes Chapter 2


The vanity of pleasures riches and worldly labours

21 I said in my heart I will go and abound with delights and enjoy
good things And I saw that this also was vanity

22 Laughter I counted error and to mirth I said Why art thou vainly
deceived

23 I thought in my heart to withdraw my flesh from wine that I
might turn my mind to wisdom and might avoid folly till I might see
what was profitable for the children of men and what they ought to do
under the sun all the days of their life

24 I made me great works I built me houses and planted vineyards

25 I made gardens and orchards and set them with trees of all
kinds

26 And I made me ponds of water to water therewith the wood of the
young trees

27 I got me menservants and maidservants and had a great family
and herds of oxen and great flocks of sheep above all that were
before me in Jerusalem

28 I heaped together for myself silver and gold and the wealth of
kings and provinces I made me singing men and singing women and the
delights of the sons of men cups and vessels to serve to pour out
wine

29 And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem my
wisdom also remained with me

210 And whatsoever my eyes desired I refused them not and I
withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure and delighting
itself in the things which I had prepared and esteemed this my
portion to make use of my own labour

211 And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had
wrought and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain I saw in
all things vanity and vexation of mind and that nothing was lasting
under the sun

212 I passed further to behold wisdom and errors and folly What is
man said I that he can follow the King his maker

213 And I saw that wisdom excelled folly as much as light differeth
from darkness

214 The eyes of a wise man are in his head the fool walketh in
darkness and I learned that they were to die both alike

215 And I said in my heart If the death of the fool and mine shall
be one what doth it avail me that I have applied myself more to the
study of wisdom And speaking with my own mind I perceived that this
also was vanity

216 For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the
fool forever and the times to come shall cover all things together
with oblivion the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned

217 And therefore I was weary of my life when I saw that all things
under the sun are evil and all vanity and vexation of spirit

218 Again I hated all my application wherewith I had earnestly
laboured under the sun being like to have an heir after me

219 Whom I know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool and he
shall have rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been
solicitous and is there anything so vain

220 Wherefore I left off and my heart renounced labouring anymore
under the sun

221 For when a man laboureth in wisdom and knowledge and
carefulness he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man so this
also is vanity and a great evil

222 For what profit shall a man have of all his labour and vexation
of spirit with which he hath been tormented under the sun

223 All his days are full of sorrows and miseries even in the night
he doth not rest in mind and is not this vanity

224 Is it not better to eat and drink and to shew his soul good
things of his labours and this is from the hand of God

225 Who shall so feast and abound with delights as I

226 God hath given to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and
knowledge and joy but to the sinner he hath given vexation and
superfluous care to heap up and to gather together and to give it to
him that hath pleased God but this also is vanity and a fruitless
solicitude of the mind



Ecclesiastes Chapter 3


All human things are liable to perpetual changes We are to rest on
Gods providence and cast away fruitless cares

31 All things have their season and in their times all things pass
under heaven

32 A time to be born and a time to die A time to plant and a time
to pluck up that which is planted

33 A time to kill and a time to heal A time to destroy and a time
to build

34 A time to weep and a time to laugh A time to mourn and a time
to dance

35 A time to scatter stones and a time to gather A time to embrace
and a time to be far from embraces

36 A time to get and a time to lose A time to keep and a time to
cast away

37 A time to rend and a time to sew A time to keep silence and a
time to speak

38 A time of love and a time of hatred A time of war and a time of
peace

39 What hath man more of his labour

310 I have seen the trouble which God hath given the sons of men to
be exercised in it

311 He hath made all things good in their time and hath delivered
the world to their consideration so that man cannot find out the work
which God hath made from the beginning to the end

312 And I have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice
and to do well in this life

313 For every man that eateth and drinketh and seeth good of his
labour this is the gift of God

314 I have learned that all the works which God hath made continue
for ever we cannot add any thing nor take away from those things
which God hath made that he may be feared

315 That which hath been made the same continueth the things that
shall be have already been and God restoreth that which is past

316 I saw under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness and in
the place of justice iniquity

317 And I said in my heart God shall judge both the just and the
wicked and then shall be the time of every thing

318 I said in my heart concerning the sons of men that God would
prove them and shew them to be like beasts

319 Therefore the death of man and of beasts is one and the
condition of them both is equal as man dieth so they also die all
things breathe alike and man hath nothing more than beast all things
are subject to vanity

Man hath nothing more etc  Viz as to the life of the body

320 And all things go to one place of earth they were made and into
earth they return together

321 Who knoweth if the spirit of the children of Adam ascend upward
and if the spirit of the beasts descend downward

Who knoweth etc  Viz experimentally since no one in this life can
see a spirit But as to the spirit of the beasts which is merely
animal and become extinct by the death of the beast who can tell the
manner it acts so as to give life and motion and by death to descend
downward that is to be no more

322 And I have found that nothing is better than for a man to rejoice
in his work and that this is his portion For who shall bring him to
know the things that shall be after him



Ecclesiastes Chapter 4


Other instances of human miseries

41 I turned myself to other things and I saw the oppressions that
are done under the sun and the tears of the innocent and they had no
comforter and they were not able to resist their violence being
destitute of help from any

42 And I praised the dead rather than the living

43 And I judged him happier than them both that is not yet born nor
hath seen the evils that are done under the sun

44 Again I considered all the labours of men and I remarked that
their industries are exposed to the envy of their neighbour so in this
also there is vanity and fruitless care

45 The fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh
saying

46 Better is a handful with rest than both hands full with labour
and vexation of mind

47 Considering I found also another vanity under the sun

48 There is but one and he hath not a second no child no brother
and yet he ceaseth not to labour neither are his eyes satisfied with
riches neither doth he reflect saying For whom do I labour and
defraud my soul of good things in this also is vanity and a grievous
vexation

49 It is better therefore that two should be together than one for
they have the advantage of their society

410 If one fall he shall be supported by the other woe to him that
is alone for when he falleth he hath none to lift him up

411 And if two lie together they shall warm one another how shall
one alone be warmed

412 And if a man prevail against one two shall withstand him a
threefold cord is not easily broken

413 Better is a child that is poor and wise than a king that is old
and foolish who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter

414 Because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to
a kingdom and another born king is consumed with poverty

415 I saw all men living that walk under the sun with the second
young man who shall rise up in his place

416 The number of the people of all that were before him is
infinite and they that shall come afterwards shall not rejoice in
him but this also is vanity and vexation of spirit

417 Keep thy foot when thou goest into the house of God and draw
nigh to hear For much better is obedience than the victims of fools
who know not what evil they do



Ecclesiastes Chapter 5


Caution in words Vows are to be paid Riches are often pernicious
the moderate use of them is the gift of God

51 Speak not any thing rashly and let not thy heart be hasty to
utter a word before God For God is in heaven and thou upon earth
therefore let thy words be few

52 Dreams follow many cares and in many words shall be found folly

53 If thou hast vowed any thing to God defer not to pay it for an
unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him but whatsoever thou
hast vowed pay it

54 And it is much better not to vow than after a vow not to perform
the things promised

55 Give not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin and say not before
the angel There is no providence lest God be angry at thy words and
destroy all the works of thy hands

56 Where there are many dreams there are many vanities and words
without number but do thou fear God

57 If thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor and violent
judgments and justice perverted in the province wonder not at this
matter for he that is high hath another higher and there are others
still higher than these

58 Moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject
to him

59 A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money and he that
loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them so this also is vanity

510 Where there are great riches there are also many to eat them
And what doth it profit the owner but that he seeth the riches with
his eyes

511 Sleep is sweet to a labouring man whether he eat little or much
but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep

512 There is also another grievous evil which I have seen under the
sun riches kept to the hurt of the owner

513 For they are lost with very great affliction he hath begotten a
son who shall be in extremity of want

514 As he came forth naked from his mothers womb so shall he
return and shall take nothing away with him of his labour

515 A most deplorable evil as he came so shall he return What then
doth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind

516 All the days of his life he eateth in darkness and in many
cares and in misery and sorrow

517 This therefore hath seemed good to me that a man should eat and
drink and enjoy the fruit of his labour wherewith he hath laboured
under the sun all the days of his life which God hath given him and
this is his portion

518 And every man to whom God hath given riches and substance and
hath given him power to eat thereof and to enjoy his portion and to
rejoice of his labour this is the gift of God

519 For he shall not much remember the days of his life because God
entertaineth his heart with delight



Ecclesiastes Chapter 6


The misery of the covetous man

61 There is also another evil which I have seen under the sun and
that frequent among men

62 A man to whom God hath given riches and substance and honour
and his soul wanteth nothing of all that he desireth yet God doth not
give him power to eat thereof but a stranger shall eat it up This is
vanity and a great misery

63 If a man beget a hundred children and live many years and attain
to a great age and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance
and he be without burial of this man I pronounce that the untimely
born is better than he

64 For he came in vain and goeth to darkness and his name shall be
wholly forgotten

65 He hath not seen the sun nor known the distance of good and evil

66 Although he lived two thousand years and hath not enjoyed good
things do not all make haste to one place

67 All the labour of man is for his mouth but his soul shall not be
filled

68 What hath the wise man more than the fool and what the poor man
but to go thither where there is life

69 Better it is to see what thou mayst desire than to desire that
which thou canst not know But this also is vanity and presumption of
spirit

610 He that shall be his name is already called and it is known
that he is a man and cannot contend in judgment with him that is
stronger than himself

611 There are many words that have much vanity in disputing



Ecclesiastes Chapter 7


Prescriptions against worldly vanities mortification patience and
seeking wisdom

71 What needeth a man to seek things that are above him whereas he
knoweth not what is profitable for him in his life in all the days of
his pilgrimage and the time that passeth like a shadow Or who can
tell him what shall be after him under the sun

72 A good name is better than precious ointments and the day of
death than the day of ones birth

73 It is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of
feasting for in that we are put in mind of the end of all and the
living thinketh what is to come

74 Anger is better than laughter because by the sadness of the
countenance the mind of the offender is corrected

Anger  That is correction or just wrath and zeal against evil

75 The heart of the wise is where there is mourning and the heart of
fools where there is mirth

76 It is better to be rebuked by a wise man than to be deceived by
the flattery of fools

77 For as the crackling of thorns burning under a pot so is the
laughter of a fool now this also is vanity

78 Oppression troubleth the wise and shall destroy the strength of
his heart

79 Better is the end of a speech than the beginning Better is the
patient man than the presumptuous

710 Be not quickly angry for anger resteth in the bosom of a fool

711 Say not What thinkest thou is the cause that former times were
better than they are now for this manner of question is foolish

712 Wisdom with riches is more profitable and bringeth more
advantage to them that see the sun

713 For as wisdom is a defence so money is a defence but learning
and wisdom excel in this that they give life to him that possesseth
them

714 Consider the works of God that no man can correct whom he hath
despised

715 In the good day enjoy good things and beware beforehand of the
evil day for God hath made both the one and the other that man may
not find against him any just complaint

716 These things also I saw in the days of my vanity A just man
perisheth in his justice and a wicked man liveth a long time in his
wickedness

717 Be not over just and be not more wise than is necessary lest
thou become stupid

Over just  Viz By an excessive rigour in censuring the ways of God
in bearing with the wicked

718 Be not overmuch wicked and be not foolish lest thou die before
thy time

Be not overmuch wicked  That is lest by the greatness of your sin
you leave no room for mercy

719 It is good that thou shouldst hold up the just yea and from him
withdraw not thy hand for he that feareth God neglecteth nothing

720 Wisdom hath strengthened the wise more than ten princes of the
city

721 For there is no just man upon earth that doth good and sinneth
not

722 But do not apply thy heart to all words that are spoken lest
perhaps thou hear thy servant reviling thee

723 For thy conscience knoweth that thou also hast often spoken evil
of others

724 I have tried all things in wisdom I have said I will be wise
and it departed farther from me

725 Much more than it was it is a great depth who shall find it
out

726 I have surveyed all things with my mind to know and consider
and seek out wisdom and reason and to know the wickedness of the fool
and the error of the imprudent

727 And I have found a woman more bitter than death who is the
hunters snare and her heart is a net and her hands are bands He
that pleaseth God shall escape from her but he that is a sinner shall
be caught by her

728 Lo this have I found said Ecclesiastes weighing one thing after
another that I might find out the account

729 Which yet my soul seeketh and I have not found it One man among
a thousand I have found a woman among them all I have not found

730 Only this I have found that God made man right and he hath
entangled himself with an infinity of questions Who is as the wise
man and who hath known the resolution of the word

Of the word  That is of this obscure and difficult matter



Ecclesiastes Chapter 8


True wisdom is to observe Gods commandments The ways of God are
unsearchable

81 The wisdom of a man shineth in his countenance and the most
mighty will change his face

82 I observe the mouth of the king and the commandments of the oath
of God

83 Be not hasty to depart from his face and do not continue in an
evil work for he will do all that pleaseth him

84 And his word is full of power neither can any man say to him Why
dost thou so

85 He that keepeth the commandment shall find no evil The heart of
a wiser man understandeth time and answer

86 There is a time and opportunity for every business and great
affliction for man

87 Because he is ignorant of things past and things to come he
cannot know by any messenger

88 It is not in mans power to stop the spirit neither hath he power
in the day of death neither is he suffered to rest when war is at
hand neither shall wickedness save the wicked

89 All these things I have considered and applied my heart to all
the works that are done under the sun Sometimes one man ruleth over
another to his own hurt

810 I saw the wicked buried who also when they were yet living were
in the holy place and were praised in the city as men of just works
but this also is vanity

811 For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil
the children of men commit evils without any fear

812 But though a sinner do evil a hundred times and by patience be
borne withal I know from thence that it shall be well with them that
fear God who dread his face

813 But let it not be well with the wicked neither let his days be
prolonged but as a shadow let them pass away that fear not the face of
the Lord

814 There is also another vanity which is done upon the earth There
are just men to whom evils happen as though they had done the works of
the wicked and there are wicked men who are as secure as though they
had the deeds of the just but this also I judge most vain

815 Therefore I commended mirth because there was no good for a man
under the sun but to eat and drink and be merry and that he should
take nothing else with him of his labour in the days of his life which
God hath given him under the sun

No good for a man etc  Some commentators think the wise man here
speaks in the person of the libertine representing the objections of
these men against divine providence and the inferences they draw from
thence which he takes care afterwards to refute But it may also be
said that his meaning is to commend the moderate use of the goods of
this world preferably to the cares and solicitudes of worldlings
their attachment to vanity and curiosity and presumptuously diving
into the unsearchable ways of divine providence

816 And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to understand the
distraction that is upon earth for there are some that day and night
take no sleep with their eyes

817 And I understood that man can find no reason of all those works
of God that are done under the sun and the more he shall labour to
seek so much the less shall he find yea though the wise man shall
say that he knoweth it he shall not be able to find it



Ecclesiastes Chapter 9


Man knows not certainty that he is in Gods grace After death no more
work or merit

91 All these things have I considered in my heart that I might
carefully understand them there are just men and wise men and their
works are in the hand of God and yet man knoweth not whether he be
worthy of love or hatred

92 But all things are kept uncertain for the time to come because
all things equally happen to the just and to the wicked to the good
and to the evil to the clean and to the unclean to him that offereth
victims and to him that despiseth sacrifices As the good is so also
is the sinner as the perjured so he also that sweareth truth

93 This is a very great evil among all things that are done under the
sun that the same things happen to all men whereby also the hearts of
the children of men are filled with evil and with contempt while they
live and afterwards they shall be brought down to hell

94 There is no man that liveth always or that hopeth for this a
living dog is better than a dead lion

95 For the living know that they shall die but the dead know nothing
more neither have they a reward any more for the memory of them is
forgotten

Know nothing more  Viz as to the transactions of this world in
which they have now no part unless it be revealed to them neither
have they any knowledge or power now of doing any thing to secure their
eternal state if they have not taken care of it in their lifetime
nor can they now procure themselves any good as the living always may
do by the grace of God

96 Their love also and their hatred and their envy are all
perished neither have they any part in this world and in the work
that is done under the sun

97 Go then and eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with
gladness because thy works please God

98 At all times let thy garments be white and let not oil depart
from thy head

99 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy
unsteady life which are given to thee under the sun all the time of
thy vanity for this is thy portion in life and in thy labour
wherewith thou labourest under the sun

910 Whatsoever thy hand is able to do do it earnestly for neither
work nor reason nor wisdom nor knowledge shall be in hell whither
thou art hastening

911 I turned me to another thing and I saw that under the sun the
race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong nor bread to
the wise nor riches to the learned nor favour to the skilful but
time and chance in all

912 Man knoweth not his own end but as fishes are taken with the
hook and as birds are caught with the snare so men are taken in the
evil time when it shall suddenly come upon them

913 This wisdom also I have seen under the sun and it seemed to me
to be very great

914 A little city and few men in it there came against it a great
king and invested it and built bulwarks round about it and the siege
was perfect

915 Now there was found in it a man poor and wise and he delivered
the city by his wisdom and no man afterward remembered that poor man

916 And I said that wisdom is better than strength how then is the
wisdom of the poor man slighted and his words not heard

917 The words of the wise are heard in silence more than the cry of
a prince among fools

918 Better is wisdom than weapons of war and he that shall offend
in one shall lose many good things



Ecclesiastes Chapter 10


Observations on wisdom and folly ambition and detraction

101 Dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment Wisdom and glory
is more precious than a small and shortlived folly

102 The heart of a wise man is in his right hand and the heart of a
fool is in his left hand

103 Yea and the fool when he walketh in the way whereas he himself
is a fool esteemeth all men fools

104 If the spirit of him that hath power ascend upon thee leave not
thy place because care will make the greatest sins to cease

105 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun as it were by an
error proceeding from the face of the prince

106 A fool set in high dignity and the rich sitting beneath

107 I have seen servants upon horses and princes walking on the
ground as servants

108 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and he that breaketh a
hedge a serpent shall bite him

109 He that removeth stones shall be hurt by them and he that
cutteth trees shall be wounded by them

1010 If the iron be blunt and be not as before but be made blunt
with much labour it shall be sharpened and after industry shall follow
wisdom

1011 If a serpent bite in silence he is nothing better that
backbiteth secretly

1012 The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace but the lips of
a fool shall throw him down headlong

1013 The beginning of his words is folly and the end of his talk is
a mischievous error

1014 A fool multiplieth words A man cannot tell what hath been
before him and what shall be after him who can tell him

1015 The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not how to go
to the city

1016 Woe to thee O land when thy king is a child and when the
princes eat in the morning

1017 Blessed is the land whose king is noble and whose princes eat
in due season for refreshment and not for riotousness

1018 By slothfulness a building shall be brought down and through
the weakness of hands the house shall drop through

1019 For laughter they make bread and wine that the living may
feast and all things obey money

1020 Detract not the king no not in thy thought and speak not evil
of the rich man in thy private chamber because even the birds of the
air will carry thy voice and he that hath wings will tell what thou
hast said



Ecclesiastes Chapter 11


Exhortation to works of mercy while we have time to diligence in
good and to the remembrance of death and judgment

111 Cast thy bread upon the running waters for after a long time
thou shalt find it again

112 Give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not
what evil shall be upon the earth

113 If the clouds be full they will pour out rain upon the earth If
the tree fall to the south or to the north in what place soever it
shall fall there shall it be

If the tree fall etc  The state of the soul is unchangeable when
once she comes to heaven or hell and a soul that departs this life in
the state of grace shall never fall from grace as on the other side
a soul that dies out of the state of grace shall never come to it But
this does not exclude a place of temporal punishments for such souls as
die in the state of grace yet not so as to be entirely pure and
therefore they shall be saved indeed yet so as by fire 1 Cor 313
14 15

114 He that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that
considereth the clouds shall never reap

115 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the
bones are joined together in the womb of her that is with child so
thou knowest not the works of God who is the maker of all

116 In the morning sow thy seed and in the evening let not thy hand
cease for thou knowest not which may rather spring up this or that
and if both together it shall be the better

117 The light is sweet and it is delightful for the eyes to see the
sun

118 If a man live many years and have rejoiced in them all he must
remember the darksome time and the many days which when they shall
come the things past shall be accused of vanity

119 Rejoice therefore O young man in thy youth and let thy heart
be in that which is good in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways
of thy heart and in the sight of thy eyes and know that for all these
God will bring thee into judgment

1110 Remove anger from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh
For youth and pleasure are vain



Ecclesiastes Chapter 12


The Creator is to be remembered in the days of our youth all worldly
things are vain we should fear God and keep his commandments

121 Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth before the time of
affliction come and the years draw nigh of which thou shalt say They
please me not

122 Before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars be
darkened and the clouds return after the rain

Before the sun etc  That is before old age the effects of which
upon all the senses and faculties are described in the following
verses under a variety of figures

123 When the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men
shall stagger and the grinders shall be idle in a small number and
they that look through the holes shall be darkened

124 And they shall shut the doors in the street when the grinders
voice shall be low and they shall rise up at the voice of the bird
and all the daughters of music shall grow deaf

125 And they shall fear high things and they shall be afraid in the
way the almond tree shall flourish the locust shall be made fat and
the caper tree shall be destroyed because man shall go into the house
of his eternity and the mourners shall go round about in the street

126 Before the silver cord be broken and the golden fillet shrink
back and the pitcher be crushed at the fountain and the wheel be
broken upon the cistern

127 And the dust return into its earth from whence it was and the
spirit return to God who gave it

128 Vanity of vanities said Ecclesiastes and all things are vanity

129 And whereas Ecclesiastes was very wise he taught the people and
declared the things that he had done and seeking out he set forth
many parables

1210 He sought profitable words and wrote words most right and full
of truth

1211 The words of the wise are as goads and as nails deeply fastened
in which by the counsel of masters are given from one shepherd

1212 More than these my son require not Of making many books there
is no end and much study is an affliction of the flesh

1213 Let us all hear together the conclusion of the discourse Fear
God and keep his commandments for this is all man

All man  The whole business and duty of man

1214 And all things that are done God will bring into judgment for
every error whether it be good or evil

Error  Or hidden and secret thing

Christ our Lord unless he draws us by his grace which is laid up in
his storerooms that is in the mysteries of Faith which God in his
goodness and love for mankind hath revealed first by his servant Moses
in the Old Law in figure only and afterwards in reality by his only
begotten Son Jesus Christ

humility appearing outwardly afflicted and as it were black and
contemptible but inwardly that is in its doctrine and morality fair
and beautiful

my colour the sons of my mother have fought against me they have made
me the keeper in the vineyards my vineyard I have not kept

thou liest in the midday lest I begin to wander after the flocks of
thy companions

follow after the steps of the flocks and feed thy kids beside the
tents of the shepherds

and watch her flock and though she know not entirely the power at hand

which are to be considered as thorns

awake till she please

behind our wall looking through the windows looking through the
lattices

teachers by holding forth their fallacy and erroneous doctrine which
like foxes would bite and destroy the vines

beloved to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether

31 In my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loveth I sought him
and found him not

In my bed by night etc  The Gentiles as in the dark and seeking in
heathen delusion what they could not find the true God until Christ
revealed his doctrine to them by his watchmen ver 3 that is by
the apostles and teachers by whom they were converted to the true
faith and holding that faith firmly the spouse the Catholic Church
declares ver 4 That she will not let him go till she bring him into
her mothers house etc that is till at last the Jews also shall
find him

32 I will rise and will go about the city in the streets and the
broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth I sought him and I
found him not

33 The watchmen who keep the city found me Have you seen him whom
my soul loveth

34 When I had a little passed by them I found him whom my soul
loveth I held him and I will not let him go till I bring him into my
mothers house and into the chamber of her that bore me

of the fields that you stir not up nor awake my beloved till she
please

aromatical spices of myrrh and frankincense and of all the powders
of the perfumer

surrounded the bed of Solomon

his thigh because of fears in the night

going up of purple the midst he covered with charity for the daughters
of Jerusalem

diadem wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of the joy of his
heart

Christ his church at times as it were penned up by its persecutors
and in fears expecting the divine assistance here signified by his
hand and ver 6 but he had turned aside and was gone that is Christ
permitting a further trial of suffering and again ver 7 the
keepers etc signifying the violent and cruel persecutors of the
church taking her veil despoiling the church of its places of worship

my fingers were full of the choicest myrrh

56 I opened the bolt of my door to my beloved but he had turned
aside and was gone My soul melted when he spoke I sought him and
found him not I called and he did not answer me

spices to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies

lilies

within thee

before the written law fair as the moon shewing her under the light
of the gospel and terrible as an army the power of Christs church
against its enemies

valleys and to look if the vineyard had flourished and the
pomegranates budded

thee



Canticle of Canticles Chapter 7

Hesebon which are in the gate of the daughter of the multitude Thy
nose is as the tower of Libanus that looketh toward Damascus

of the king bound in the channels

and the odour of thy mouth like apples

Canticle of Canticles Chapter 8


The love of the church to Christ his love to her

my mother that I may find thee without and kiss thee and now no man
may despise me

there thou shalt teach me and I will give thee a cup of spiced wine
and new wine of my pomegranates

83 His left hand under my head and his right hand shall embrace me

His left hand etc  Words of the church to Christ His left hand
signifying the Old Testament and his right hand the New

84 I adjure you O daughters of Jerusalem that you stir not up nor
awake my love till she please

85 Who is this that cometh up from the desert flowing with delights
leaning upon her beloved Under the apple tree I raised thee up there
thy mother was corrupted there she was defloured that bore thee

Who is this etc  The angels with admiration behold the Gentiles
converted to the faith coming up from the desert that is coming from
heathenism and false worship flowing with delights that is abounding
with good works which are pleasing to God leaning on her beloved on
the promise of Christ to his Church that the gates of hell should not
prevail against it and supported by his grace conferred by the
sacraments Under the apple tree I raised thee up that is that Christ
redeemed the Gentiles at the foot of the cross where the synagogue of
the Jews the mother church was corrupted by their denying him and
crucifying him

86 Put me as a seal upon thy heart as a seal upon thy arm for love
is strong as death jealousy as hard as hell the lamps thereof are
fire and flames

87 Many waters cannot quench charity neither can the floods drown
it if a man should give all the substance of his house for love he
shall despise it as nothing

88 Our sister is little and hath no breasts What shall we do to our
sister in the day when she is to be spoken to

Our sister is little etc  Mystically signifies the Jews who are to
be spoken to that is converted towards the end of the world and then
shall become a wall that is a part of the building the church of
Christ

89 If she be a wall let us build upon it bulwarks of silver if she
be a door let us join it together with boards of cedar

810 I am a wall and my breasts are as a tower since I am become in
his presence as one finding peace

811 The peaceable had a vineyard in that which hath people he let
out the same to keepers every man bringeth for the fruit thereof a
thousand pieces of silver

812 My vineyard is before me A thousand are for thee the peaceable
and two hundred for them that keep the fruit thereof

813 Thou that dwellest in the gardens the friends hearken make me
hear thy voice

814 Flee away O my beloved and be like to the roe and to the young
hart upon the mountains of aromatical spices




THE BOOK OF WISDOM



This Book is so called because it treats of the excellence of WISDOM
the means to obtain it and the happy fruits it produces It is written
in the person of Solomon and contains his sentiments But it is
uncertain who was the writer It abounds with instructions and
exhortations to kings and all magistrates to minister justice in the
commonwealth teaching all kinds of virtues under the general names of
justice and wisdom It contains also many prophecies of Christs
coming passion resurrection and other Christian mysteries The whole
may be divided into three parts In the first six chapters the author
admonishes all superiors to love and exercise justice and wisdom In
the next three he teacheth that wisdom proceedeth only from God and
is procured by prayer and a good life In the other ten chapters he
sheweth the excellent effects and utility of wisdom and justice



Wisdom Chapter 1


An exhortation to seek God sincerely who cannot be deceived and
desireth not our death

11 Love justice you that are the judges of the earth Think of the
Lord in goodness and seek him in simplicity of heart

12 For he is found by them that tempt him not and he sheweth himself
to them that have faith in him

13 For perverse thoughts separate from God and his power when it is
tried reproveth the unwise

14 For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul nor dwell in a
body subject to sins

15 For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful
and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding
and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in

16 For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent and will not acquit the
evil speaker from his lips for God is witness of his reins and he is
a true searcher of his heart and a hearer of his tongue

17 For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world and that
which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice

18 Therefore he that speaketh unjust things cannot be hid neither
shall the chastising judgment pass him by

19 For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly
and the hearing of his words shall come to God to the chastising of
his iniquities

110 For the ear of jealousy heareth all things and the tumult of
murmuring shall not be hid

111 Keep yourselves therefore from murmuring which profiteth
nothing and refrain your tongue from detraction for an obscure speech
shall not go for nought and the mouth that belieth killeth the soul

112 Seek not death in the error of your life neither procure ye
destruction by the works of your hands

113 For God made not death neither hath he pleasure in the
destruction of the living

114 For he created all things that they might be and he made the
nations of the earth for health and there is no poison of destruction
in them nor kingdom of hell upon the earth

115 For justice is perpetual and immortal

116 But the wicked with works and words have called it to them and
esteeming it a friend have fallen away and have made a covenant with
it because they are worthy to be of the part thereof



Wisdom Chapter 2


The vain reasonings of the wicked their persecuting the just
especially the Son of God

21 For they have said reasoning with themselves but not right The
time of our life is short and tedious and in the end of a man there is
no remedy and no man hath been known to have returned from hell

22 For we are born of nothing and after this we shall be as if we
had not been for the breath in our nostrils is smoke and speech a
spark to move our heart

23 Which being put out our body shall be ashes and our spirit shall
be poured abroad as soft air and our life shall pass away as the trace
of a cloud and shall be dispersed as a mist which is driven away by
the beams of the sun and overpowered with the heat thereof

24 And our name in time shall be forgotten and no man shall have any
remembrance of our works

25 For our time is as the passing of a shadow and there is no going
back of our end for it is fast sealed and no man returneth

26 Come therefore and let us enjoy the good things that are
present and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth

27 Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments and let not
the flower of the time pass by us

28 Let us crown ourselves with roses before they be withered let no
meadow escape our riot

29 Let none of us go without his part in luxury let us every where
leave tokens of joy for this is our portion and this our lot

210 Let us oppress the poor just man and not spare the widow nor
honour the ancient grey hairs of the aged

211 But let our strength be the law of justice for that which is
feeble is found to be nothing worth

212 Let us therefore lie in wait for the just because he is not
for our turn and he is contrary to our doings and upbraideth us with
transgressions of the law and divulgeth against us the sins of our way
of life

213 He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God and calleth
himself the son of God

214 He is become a censurer of our thoughts

215 He is grievous unto us even to behold for his life is not like
other mens and his ways are very different

216 We are esteemed by him as triflers and he abstaineth from our
ways as from filthiness and he preferreth the latter end of the just
and glorieth that he hath God for his father

217 Let us see then if his words be true and let us prove what shall
happen to him and we shall know what his end shall be

218 For if he be the true son of God he will defend him and will
deliver him from the hands of his enemies

219 Let us examine him by outrages and tortures that we may know his
meekness and try his patience

220 Let us condemn him to a most shameful death for there shall be
respect had unto him by his words

221 These things they thought and were deceived for their own
malice blinded them

222 And they knew not the secrets of God nor hoped for the wages of
justice nor esteemed the honour of holy souls

223 For God created man incorruptible and to the image of his own
likeness he made him

224 But by the envy of the devil death came into the world

225 And they follow him that are of his side



Wisdom Chapter 3


The happiness of the just and the unhappiness of the wicked

31 But the souls of the just are in the hand of God and the torment
of death shall not touch them

32 In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die and their departure
was taken for misery

33 And their going away from us for utter destruction but they are
in peace

34 And though in the sight of men they suffered torments their hope
is full of immortality

35 Afflicted in few things in many they shall be well rewarded
because God hath tried them and found them worthy of himself

36 As gold in the furnace he hath proved them and as a victim of a
holocaust he hath received them and in time there shall be respect
had to them

37 The just shall shine and shall run to and fro like sparks among
the reeds

38 They shall judge nations and rule over people and their Lord
shall reign for ever

39 They that trust in him shall understand the truth and they that
are faithful in love shall rest in him for grace and peace are to his
elect

310 But the wicked shall be punished according to their own devices
who have neglected the just and have revolted from the Lord

311 For he that rejecteth wisdom and discipline is unhappy and
their hope is vain and their labours without fruit and their works
unprofitable

312 Their wives are foolish and their children wicked

313 Their offspring is cursed for happy is the barren and the
undefiled that hath not known bed in sin she shall have fruit in the
visitation of holy souls

314 And the eunuch that hath not wrought iniquity with his hands
nor thought wicked things against God for the precious gift of faith
shall be given to him and a most acceptable lot in the temple of God

315 For the fruit of good labours is glorious and the root of wisdom
never faileth

316 But the children of adulterers shall not come to perfection and
the seed of the unlawful bed shall be rooted out

317 And if they live long they shall be nothing regarded and their
last old age shall be without honour

318 And if they die quickly they shall have no hope nor speech of
comfort in the day of trial

319 For dreadful are the ends of a wicked race



Wisdom Chapter 4


The difference between the chaste and the adulterous generations and
between the death of the just and the wicked

41 How beautiful is the chaste generation with glory for the memory
thereof is immortal because it is known both with God and with men

42 When it is present they imitate it and they desire it when it
hath withdrawn itself and it triumpheth crowned for ever winning the
reward of undefiled conflicts

43 But the multiplied brood of the wicked shall not thrive and
bastard slips shall not take deep root nor any fast foundation

44 And if they flourish in branches for a time yet standing not
fast they shall be shaken with the wind and through the force of
winds they shall be rooted out

45 For the branches not being perfect shall be broken and their
fruits shall be unprofitable and sour to eat and fit for nothing

46 For the children that are born of unlawful beds are witnesses of
wickedness against their parents in their trial

47 But the just man if he be prevented with death shall be in rest

48 For venerable old age is not that of long time nor counted by the
number of years but the understanding of a man is grey hairs

49 And a spotless life is old age

410 He pleased God and was beloved and living among sinners he was
translated

411 He was taken away lest wickedness should alter his
understanding or deceit beguile his soul

412 For the bewitching of vanity obscureth good things and the
wandering of concupiscence overturneth the innocent mind

413 Being made perfect in a short space he fulfilled a long time

414 For his soul pleased God therefore he hastened to bring him out
of the midst of iniquities but the people see this and understand
not nor lay up such things in their hearts

415 That the grace of God and his mercy is with his saints and that
he hath respect to his chosen

416 But the just that is dead condemneth the wicked that are living
and youth soon ended the long life of the unjust

417 For they shall see the end of the wise man and it shall not
understand what God hath designed for him and why the Lord hath set
him in safety

418 They shall see him and shall despise him but the Lord shall
laugh them to scorn

419 And they shall fall after this without honour and be a reproach
among the dead for ever for he shall burst them puffed up and
speechless and shall shake them from the foundations and they shall
be utterly laid waste they shall be in sorrow and their memory shall
perish

420 They shall come with fear at the thought of their sins and their
iniquities shall stand against them to convict them



Wisdom Chapter 5


The fruitless repentance of the wicked in another world the reward of
the just

51 Then shall the just stand with great constancy against those that
have afflicted them and taken away their labours

52 These seeing it shall be troubled with terrible fear and shall
be amazed at the suddenness of their unexpected salvation

53 Saying within themselves repenting and groaning for anguish of
spirit These are they whom we had sometime in derision and for a
parable of reproach

54 We fools esteemed their life madness and their end without
honour

55 Behold how they are numbered among the children of God and their
lot is among the saints

56 Therefore we have erred from the way of truth and the light of
justice hath not shined unto us and the sun of understanding hath not
risen upon us

57 We wearied ourselves in the way of iniquity and destruction and
have walked through hard ways but the way of the Lord we have not
known

58 What hath pride profited us or what advantage hath the boasting
of riches brought us

59 All those things are passed away like a shadow and like a post
that runneth on

510 And as a ship that passeth through the waves whereof when it is
gone by the trace cannot be found nor the path of its keel in the
waters

511 Or as when a bird flieth through the air of the passage of which
no mark can be found but only the sound of the wings beating the light
air and parting it by the force of her flight she moved her wings
and hath flown through and there is no mark found afterwards of her
way

512 Or as when an arrow is shot at a mark the divided air quickly
cometh together again so that the passage thereof is not known

513 So we also being born forthwith ceased to be and have been able
to shew no mark of virtue but are consumed in our wickedness

514 Such things as these the sinners said in hell

515 For the hope of the wicked is as dust which is blown away with
the wind and as a thin froth which is dispersed by the storm and a
smoke that is scattered abroad by the wind and as the remembrance of a
guest of one day that passeth by

516 But the just shall live for evermore and their reward is with
the Lord and the care of them with the most High

517 Therefore shall they receive a kingdom of glory and a crown of
beauty at the hand of the Lord for with his right hand he will cover
them and with his holy arm he will defend them

518 And his zeal will take armour and he will arm the creature for
the revenge of his enemies

519 He will put on justice as a breastplate and will take true
judgment instead of a helmet

520 He will take equity for an invincible shield

521 And he will sharpen his severe wrath for a spear and the whole
world shall fight with him against the unwise

522 Then shafts of lightning shall go directly from the clouds as
from a bow well bent they shall be shot out and shall fly to the
mark

523 And thick hail shall be cast upon them from the stone casting
wrath the water of the sea shall rage against them and the rivers
shall run together in a terrible manner

524 A mighty wind shall stand up against them and as a whirlwind
shall divide them and their iniquity shall bring all the earth to a
desert and wickedness shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty



Wisdom Chapter 6


An address to princes to seek after wisdom she is easily found by
those that seek her

61 Wisdom is better than strength and a wise man is better than a
strong man

62 Hear therefore ye kings and understand learn ye that are
judges of the ends of the earth

63 Give ear you that rule the people and that please yourselves in
multitudes of nations

64 For power is given you by the Lord and strength by the most High
who will examine your works and search out your thoughts

66 Because being ministers of his kingdom you have not judged
rightly nor kept the law of justice nor walked according to the will
of God

66 Horribly and speedily will he appear to you for a most severe
judgment shall be for them that bear rule

67 For to him that is little mercy is granted but the mighty shall
be mightily tormented

68 For God will not except any mans person neither will he stand in
awe of any mans greatness for he made the little and the great and
he hath equally care of all

69 But a greater punishment is ready for the more mighty

610 To you therefore O kings are these my words that you may
learn wisdom and not fall from it

611 For they that have kept just things justly shall be justified
and they that have learned these things shall find what to answer

612 Covet ye therefore my words and love them and you shall have
instruction

613 Wisdom is glorious and never fadeth away and is easily seen by
them that love her and is found by them that seek her

614 She preventeth them that covet her so that she first sheweth
herself unto them

615 He that awaketh early to seek her shall not labour for he shall
find her sitting at his door

616 To think therefore upon her is perfect understanding and he
that watcheth for her shall quickly be secure

617 For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her and she
sheweth herself to them cheerfully in the ways and meeteth them with
all providence

618 For the beginning of her is the most true desire of discipline

619 And the care of discipline is love and love is the keeping of
her laws and the keeping of her laws is the firm foundation of
incorruption

620 And incorruption bringeth near to God

621 Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to the everlasting
kingdom

622 If then your delight be in thrones and sceptres O ye kings of
the people love wisdom that you may reign for ever

623 Love the light of wisdom all ye that bear rule over peoples

624 Now what wisdom is and what was her origin I will declare and
I will not hide from you the mysteries of God but will seek her out
from the beginning of her birth and bring the knowledge of her to
light and will not pass over the truth

625 Neither will I go with consuming envy for such a man shall not
be partaker of wisdom

626 Now the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the whole world
and a wise king is the upholding of the people

627 Receive therefore instruction by my words and it shall be
profitable to you



Wisdom Chapter 7


The excellence of wisdom how she is to be found

71 I myself am a mortal man like all others and of the race of him
that was first made of the earth and in the womb of my mother I was
fashioned to be flesh

72 In the time of ten months I was compacted in blood of the seed of
man and the pleasure of sleep concurring

73 And being born I drew in the common air and fell upon the earth
that is made alike and the first voice which I uttered was crying as
all others do

74 I was nursed in swaddling clothes and with great cares

75 For none of the kings had any other beginning of birth

76 For all men have one entrance into life and the like going out

77 Wherefore I wished and understanding was given me and I called
upon God and the spirit of wisdom came upon me

78 And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones and esteemed
riches nothing in comparison of her

79 Neither did I compare unto her any precious stone for all gold
in comparison of her is as a little sand and silver in respect to
her shall be counted as clay

710 I loved her above health and beauty and chose to have her
instead of light for her light cannot be put out

711 Now all good things came to me together with her and innumerable
riches through her hands

712 And I rejoiced in all these for this wisdom went before me and
I knew not that she was the mother of them all

713 Which I have learned without guile and communicate without envy
and her riches I hide not

714 For she is an infinite treasure to men which they that use
become the friends of God being commended for the gifts of discipline

715 And God hath given to me to speak as I would and to conceive
thoughts worthy of those things that are given me because he is the
guide of wisdom and the director of the wise

716 For in his hand are both we and our words and all wisdom and
the knowledge and skill of works

717 For he hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are
to know the disposition of the whole world and the virtues of the
elements

718 The beginning and ending and midst of the times the
alterations of their courses and the changes of seasons

719 The revolutions of the year and the dispositions of the stars

720 The natures of living creatures and rage of wild beasts the
force of winds and reasonings of men the diversities of plants and
the virtues of roots

721 And all such things as are hid and not foreseen I have learned
for wisdom which is the worker of all things taught me

722 For in her is the spirit of understanding holy one manifold
subtile eloquent active undefiled sure sweet loving that which is
good quick which nothing hindereth beneficent

723 Gentle kind steadfast assured secure having all power
overseeing all things and containing all spirits intelligible pure
subtile

724 For wisdom is more active than all active things and reacheth
everywhere by reason of her purity

725 For she is a vapour of the power of God and a certain pure
emmanation of the glory of the Almighty God and therefore no defiled
thing cometh into her

726 For she is the brightness of eternal light and the unspotted
mirror of Gods majesty and the image of his goodness

727 And being but one she can do all things and remaining in
herself the same she reneweth all things and through nations
conveyeth herself into holy souls she maketh the friends of God and
prophets

728 For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom

729 For she is more beautiful than the sun and above all the order
of the stars being compared with the light she is found before it

730 For after this cometh night but no evil can overcome wisdom



Wisdom Chapter 8


Further praises of wisdom and her fruits

81 She reacheth therefore from end to end mightily and ordereth
all things sweetly

82 Her have I loved and have sought her out from my youth and have
desired to take for my spouse and I became a lover of her beauty

83 She glorifieth her nobility by being conversant with God yea and
the Lord of all things hath loved her

84 For it is she that teacheth the knowledge of God and is the
chooser of his works

85 And if riches be desired in life what is richer than wisdom
which maketh all things

86 And if sense do work who is a more artful worker than she of
those things that are

87 And if a man love justice her labours have great virtues for she
teacheth temperance and prudence and justice and fortitude which
are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life

88 And if a man desire much knowledge she knoweth things past and
judgeth of things to come she knoweth the subtilties of speeches and
the solutions of arguments she knoweth signs and wonders before they
be done and the events of times and ages

89 I purposed therefore to take her to me to live with me knowing
that she will communicate to me of her good things and will be a
comfort in my cares and grief

810 For her sake I shall have glory among the multitude and honour
with the ancients though I be young

811 And I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment and shall be
admired in the sight of the mighty and the faces of princes shall
wonder at me

812 They shall wait for me when I hold my peace and they shall look
upon me when I speak and if I talk much they shall lay their hands on
their mouth

813 Moreover by the means of her I shall have immortality and shall
leave behind me an everlasting memory to them that come after me

814 I shall set the people in order and nations shall be subject to
me

815 Terrible kings hearing shall be afraid of me among the
multitude I shall be found good and valiant in war

816 When I go into my house I shall repose myself with her for her
conversation hath no bitterness nor her company any tediousness but
joy and gladness

817 Thinking these things with myself and pondering them in my
heart that to be allied to wisdom is immortality

818 And that there is great delight in her friendship and
inexhaustible riches in the works of her hands and in the exercise of
conference with her wisdom and glory in the communication of her
words I went about seeking that I might take her to myself

819 And I was a witty child and had received a good soul

820 And whereas I was more good I came to a body undefiled

821 And as I knew that I could not otherwise be continent except God
gave it and this also was a point of wisdom to know whose gift it
was I went to the Lord and besought him and said with my whole
heart



Wisdom Chapter 9


Solomons prayer for wisdom

91 God of my fathers and Lord of mercy who hast made all things
with thy word

92 And by thy wisdom hast appointed man that he should have dominion
over the creature that was made by thee

93 That he should order the world according to equity and justice
and execute justice with an upright heart

94 Give me wisdom that sitteth by thy throne and cast me not off
from among thy children

95 For I am thy servant and the son of thy handmaid a weak man and
of short time and falling short of the understanding of judgment and
laws

96 For if one be perfect among the children of men yet if thy wisdom
be not with him he shall be nothing regarded

97 Thou hast chosen me to be king of thy people and a judge of thy
sons and daughters

98 And hast commanded me to build a temple on thy holy mount and an
altar in the city of thy dwelling place a resemblance of thy holy
tabernacle which thou hast prepared from the beginning

99 And thy wisdom with thee which knoweth thy works which then also
was present when thou madest the world and knew what was agreeable to
thy eyes and what was right in thy commandments

910 Send her out of thy holy heaven and from the throne of thy
majesty that she may be with me and may labour with me that I may
know what is acceptable with thee

911 For she knoweth and understandeth all things and shall lead me
soberly in my works and shall preserve me by her power

912 So shall my works be acceptable and I shall govern thy people
justly and shall be worthy of the throne of my father

913 For who among men is he that can know the counsel of God or who
can think what the will of God is

914 For the thoughts of mortal men are fearful and our counsels
uncertain

915 For the corruptible body is a load upon the soul and the earthly
habitation presseth down the mind that museth upon many things

916 And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth and
with labour do we find the things that are before us But the things
that are in heaven who shall search out

917 And who shall know thy thought except thou give wisdom and send
thy holy Spirit from above

918 And so the ways of them that are upon earth may be corrected and
men may learn the things that please thee

919 For by wisdom they were healed whosoever have pleased thee O
Lord from the beginning



Wisdom Chapter 10


What wisdom did for Adam Noe Abraham Lot Jacob Joseph and the
people of Israel

101 She preserved him that was first formed by God the father of
the world when he was created alone

102 And she brought him out of his sin and gave him power to govern
all things

103 But when the unjust went away from her in his anger he perished
by the fury wherewith he murdered his brother

The unjust  Cain

104 For whose cause when water destroyed the earth wisdom healed it
again directing the course of the just by contemptible wood

For whose cause  Viz for the wickedness of the race of CainIbid
The just  Noe

105 Moreover when the nations had conspired together to consent to
wickedness she knew the just and preserved him without blame to God
and kept him strong against the compassion for his son

She knew the just  She found out and approved Abraham Ibid
And kept him strong etc  Gave him strength to stand firm against
the efforts of his natural tenderness when he was ordered to sacrifice
his son

106 She delivered the just man who fled from the wicked that were
perishing when the fire came down upon Pentapolis

The just man  LotIbid Pentapolis  The land of the five cities
Sodom Gomorrha etc

107 Whose land for a testimony of their wickedness is desolate and
smoketh to this day and the trees bear fruits that ripen not and a
standing pillar of salt is a monument of an incredulous soul

108 For regarding not wisdom they did not only slip in this that
they were ignorant of good things but they left also unto men a
memorial of their folly so that in the things in which they sinned
they could not so much as lie hid

109 But wisdom hath delivered from sorrow them that attend upon her

1010 She conducted the just when he fled from his brothers wrath
through the right ways and shewed him the kingdom of God and gave him
the knowledge of the holy things made him honourable in his labours
and accomplished his labours

The just  Jacob

1011 In the deceit of them that overreached him she stood by him
and made him honourable

1012 She kept him safe from his enemies and she defended him from
seducers and gave him a strong conflict that he might overcome and
know that wisdom is mightier than all

Conflict  Viz with the angel

1013 She forsook not the just when he was sold but delivered him
from sinners she went down with him into the pit

The just when he was sold  Viz Joseph

1014 And in bands she left him not till she brought him the sceptre
of the kingdom and power against those that oppressed him and shewed
them to be liars that had accused him and gave him everlasting glory

1015 She delivered the just people and blameless seed from the
nations that oppressed them

1016 She entered into the soul of the servant of God and stood
against dreadful kings in wonders and signs

The servant of God  Viz Moses

1017 And she rendered to the just the wages of their labours and
conducted them in a wonderful way and she was to them for a covert by
day and for the light of stars by night

1018 And she brought them through the Red Sea and carried them over
through a great water

1019 But their enemies she drowned in the sea and from the depth of
hell she brought them out Therefore the just took the spoils of the
wicked

1020 And they sung to thy holy name O Lord and they praised with
one accord thy victorious hand

1021 For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb and made the tongues of
infants eloquent



Wisdom Chapter 11


Other benefits of wisdom to the people of God

111 She prospered their works in the hands of the holy prophet

The holy prophet  Moses

112 They went through wildernesses that were not inhabited and in
desert places they pitched their tents

113 They stood against their enemies and revenged themselves of
their adversaries

Their enemies  The Amalecites

114 They were thirsty and they called upon thee and water was given
them out of the high rock and a refreshment of their thirst out of the
hard stone

115 For by what things their enemies were punished when their drink
failed them while the children of Israel abounded therewith and
rejoiced

By what things etc  The meaning is that God who wrought a miracle
to punish the Egyptians by thirst when he turned all their waters into
blood at which time the Israelites who were exempt from those
plagues had plenty of water wrought another miracle in favour of his
own people in their thirst by giving them water out of the rock

116 By the same things they in their need were benefited

117 For instead of a fountain of an ever running river thou gavest
human blood to the unjust

118 And whilst they were diminished for a manifest reproof of their
murdering the infants thou gavest to thine abundant water unlooked
for

119 Shewing by the thirst that was then how thou didst exalt thine
and didst kill their adversaries

1110 For when they were tried and chastised with mercy they knew
how the wicked were judged with wrath and tormented

1111 For thou didst admonish and try them as a father but the
others as a severe king thou didst examine and condemn

1112 For whether absent or present they were tormented alike

1113 For a double affliction came upon them and a groaning for the
remembrance of things past

1114 For when they heard that by their punishments the others were
benefited they remembered the Lord wondering at the end of what was
come to pass

By their punishments etc  That is that the Israelites had been
benefited and miraculously favoured in the same kind in which they had
been punished

1115 For whom they scorned before when he was thrown out at the time
of his being wickedly exposed to perish him they admired in the end
when they saw the event their thirsting being unlike to that of the
just

1116 But for the foolish devices of their iniquity because some
being deceived worshipped dumb serpents and worthless beasts thou
didst send upon them a multitude of dumb beasts for vengeance

Dumb beasts  Viz frogs sciniphs flies and locusts

1117 That they might know that by what things a man sinneth by the
same also he is tormented

1118 For thy almighty hand which made the world of matter without
form was not unable to send upon them a multitude of bears or fierce
lions

1119 Or unknown beasts of a new kind full of rage either breathing
out a fiery vapour or sending forth a stinking smoke or shooting
horrible sparks out of their eyes

1120 Whereof not only the hurt might be able to destroy them but
also the very sight might kill them through fear

1121 Yea and without these they might have been slain with one
blast persecuted by their own deeds and scattered by the breath of
thy power but thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and
weight

1122 For great power always belonged to thee alone and who shall
resist the strength of thy arm

1123 For the whole world before thee is as the least grain of the
balance and as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon tho
earth

1124 But thou hast mercy upon all because thou canst do all things
and overlookest the sins of men for the sake of repentance

1125 For thou lovest all things that are and hatest none of the
things which thou hast made for thou didst not appoint or make any
thing hating it

1126 And how could any thing endure if thou wouldst not or be
preserved if not called by thee

1127 But thou sparest all because they are thine O Lord who lovest
souls



Wisdom Chapter 12


Gods wisdom and mercy in his proceedings with the Chanaanites

121 O how good and sweet is thy Spirit O Lord in all things

122 And therefore thou chastisest them that err by little and
little and admonishest them and speakest to them concerning the
things wherein they offend that leaving their wickedness they may
believe in thee O Lord

123 For those ancient inhabitants of thy holy land whom thou didst
abhor

124 Because they did works hateful to thee by their sorceries and
wicked sacrifices

125 And those merciless murderers of their own children and eaters
of mens bowels and devourers of blood from the midst of thy
consecration

From the midst of thy consecration  Literally sacrament That is
the land sacred to thee in which thy temple was to be established and
mans redemption to be wrought

126 And those parents sacrificing with their own hands helpless
souls it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our parents

127 That the land which of all is most dear to thee might receive a
worthy colony of the children of God

128 Yet even those thou sparedst as men and didst send wasps
forerunners of thy host to destroy them by little and little

129 Not that thou wast unable to bring the wicked under the just by
war or by cruel beasts or with one rough word to destroy them at
once

1210 But executing thy judgments by degrees thou gavest them place
of repentance not being ignorant that they were a wicked generation
and their malice natural and that their thought could never be
changed

1211 For it was a cursed seed from the beginning neither didst thou
for fear of any one give pardon to their sins

1212 For who shall say to thee What hast thou done or who shall
withstand thy judgment or who shall come before thee to be a revenger
of wicked men or who shall accuse thee if the nations perish which
thou hast made 

1213 For there is no other God but thou who hast care of all that
thou shouldst shew that thou dost not give judgment unjustly

1214 Neither shall king nor tyrant in thy sight inquire about them
whom thou hast destroyed

1215 For so much then as thou art just thou orderest all things
justly thinking it not agreeable to the power to condemn him who
deserveth not to be punished

1216 For thy power is the beginning of justice and because thou art
Lord of all thou makest thyself gracious to all

1217 For thou shewest thy power when men will not believe thee to be
absolute in power and thou convincest the boldness of them that know
thee not

1218 But thou being master of power judgest with tranquillity and
with great favour disposest of us for thy power is at hand when thou
wilt

1219 But thou hast taught thy people by such works that they must be
just and humane and hast made thy children to be of a good hope
because in judging thou givest place for repentance for sins

1220 For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy servants and that
deserved to die with so great deliberation giving them time and place
whereby they might be changed from their wickedness

1221 With what circumspection hast thou judged thy own children to
whose parents thou hast sworn and made covenants of good promises

1222 Therefore whereas thou chastisest us thou scourgest our enemies
very many ways to the end that when we judge we may think on thy
goodness and when we are judged we may hope for thy mercy

1223 Wherefore thou hast also greatly tormented them who in their
life have lived foolishly and unjustly by the same things which they
worshipped

1224 For they went astray for a long time in the ways of error
holding those things for gods which are the most worthless among
beasts living after the manner of children without understanding

1225 Therefore thou hast sent a judgment upon them as senseless
children to mock them

1226 But they that were not amended by mockeries and reprehensions
experienced the worthy judgment of God

1227 For seeing with indignation that they suffered by those very
things which they took for gods when they were destroyed by the same
they acknowledged him the true God whom in time past they denied that
they knew for which cause the end also of their condemnation came upon
them



Wisdom Chapter 13


Idolaters are inexcusable and those most of all that worship for gods
the works of the hands of men

131 But all men are vain in whom there is not the knowledge of God
and who by these good things that are seen could not understand him
that is neither by attending to the works have acknowledged who was
the workman

132 But have imagined either the fire or the wind or the swift air
or the circle of the stars or the great water or the sun and moon to
be the gods that rule the world

133 With whose beauty if they being delighted took them to be
gods let them know how much the Lord of them is more beautiful than
they for the first author of beauty made all those things

134 Or if they admired their power and their effects let them
understand by them that he that made them is mightier than they

135 For by the greatness of the beauty and of the creature the
creator of them may be seen so as to be known thereby

136 But yet as to these they are less to be blamed For they perhaps
err seeking God and desirous to find him

137 For being conversant among his works they search and they are
persuaded that the things are good which are seen

138 But then again they are not to be pardoned

139 For if they were able to know so much as to make a judgment of
the world how did they not more easily find out the Lord thereof

1310 But unhappy are they and their hope is among the dead who have
called gods the works of the hand of men gold and silver the
inventions of art and the resemblances of beasts or an unprofitable
stone the work of an ancient hand

1311 Or if an artist a carpenter hath cut down a tree proper for
his use in the wood and skilfully taken off all the bark thereof and
with his art diligently formeth a vessel profitable for the common
uses of life

1312 And useth the chips of his work to dress his meat

1313 And taking what was left thereof which is good for nothing
being a crooked piece of wood and full of knots carveth it diligently
when he hath nothing else to do and by the skill of his art fashioneth
it and maketh it like the image of a man

1314 Or the resemblance of some beast laying it over with vermilion
and painting it red and covering every spot that is in it

1315 And maketh a convenient dwelling place for it and setting it in
a wall and fastening it with iron

1316 Providing for it lest it should fall knowing that it is unable
to help itself for it is an image and hath need of help

1317 And then maketh prayer to it enquiring concerning his
substance and his children or his marriage And he is not ashamed to
speak to that which hath no life

1318 And for health he maketh supplication to the weak and for life
prayeth to that which is dead and for help calleth upon that which is
unprofitable

1319 And for a good journey he petitioneth him that cannot walk and
for getting and for working and for the event of all things he asketh
him that is unable to do any thing



Wisdom Chapter 14


The beginning of worshipping idols and the effects thereof

141 Again another designing to sail and beginning to make his
voyage through the raging waves calleth upon a piece of wood more
frail than the wood that carrieth him

142 For this the desire of gain devised and the workman built it by
his skill

143 But thy providence O Father governeth it for thou hast made a
way even in the sea and a most sure path among the waves

144 Shewing that thou art able to save out of all things yea though
a man went to sea without art

145 But that the works of thy wisdom might not be idle therefore men
also trust their lives even to a little wood and passing over the sea
by ship are saved

146 And from the beginning also when the proud giants perished the
hope of the world fleeing to a vessel which was governed by thy hand
left to the world seed of generation

147 For blessed is the wood by which justice cometh

148 But the idol that is made by hands is cursed as well it as he
that made it he because he made it and it because being frail it is
called a god

149 But to God the wicked and his wickedness are hateful alike

1410 For that which is made together with him that made it shall
suffer torments

1411 Therefore there shall be no respect had even to the idols of the
Gentiles because the creatures of God are turned to an abomination
and a temptation to the souls of men and a snare to the feet of the
unwise

1412 For the beginning of fornication is the devising of idols and
the invention of them is the corruption of life

1413 For neither were they from the beginning neither shall they be
for ever

1414 For by the vanity of men they came into the world and therefore
they shall be found to come shortly to an end

1415 For a father being afflicted with bitter grief made to himself
the image of his son who was quickly taken away and him who then had
died as a man he began now to worship as a god and appointed him
rites and sacrifices among his servants

1416 Then in process of time wicked custom prevailing this error
was kept as a law and statues were worshipped by the commandment of
tyrants

1417 And those whom men could not honour in presence because they
dwelt far off they brought their resemblance from afar and made an
express image of the king whom they had a mind to honour that by this
their diligence they might honour as present him that was absent

1418 And to the worshipping of these the singular diligence also of
the artificer helped to set forward the ignorant

1419 For he being willing to please him that employed him laboured
with all his art to make the resemblance in the best manner

1420 And the multitude of men carried away by the beauty of the
work took him now for a god that little before was but honoured as a
man

1421 And this was the occasion of deceiving human life for men
serving either their affection or their kings gave the incommunicable
name to stones and wood

1422 And it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of
God but whereas they lived in a great war of ignorance they call so
many and so great evils peace

1423 For either they sacrifice their own children or use hidden
sacrifices or keep watches full of madness

1424 So that now they neither keep life nor marriage undefiled but
one killeth another through envy or grieveth him by adultery

1425 And all things are mingled together blood murder theft and
dissimulation corruption and unfaithfulness tumults and perjury
disquieting of the good

1426 Forgetfulness of God defiling of souls changing of nature
disorder in marriage and the irregularity of adultery and uncleanness

1427 For the worship of abominable idols is the cause and the
beginning and end of all evil

1428 For either they are mad when they are merry or they prophesy
lies or they live unjustly or easily forswear themselves

1429 For whilst they trust in idols which are without life though
they swear amiss they look not to be hurt

1430 But for both these things they shall be justly punished because
they have thought not well of God giving heed to idols and have sworn
unjustly in guile despising justice

1431 For it is not the power of them by whom they swear but the
just vengeance of sinners always punisheth the transgression of the
unjust



Wisdom Chapter 15


The servants of God praise him who hath delivered them from idolatry
condemning both the makers and the worshippers of idols

151 But thou our God art gracious and true patient and ordering
all things in mercy

152 For if we sin we are thine knowing thy greatness and if we sin
not we know that we are counted with thee

153 For to know thee is perfect justice and to know thy justice and
thy power is the root of immortality

154 For the invention of mischievous men hath not deceived us nor
the shadow of a picture a fruitless labour a graven figure with
divers colours

155 The sight whereof enticeth the fool to lust after it and he
loveth the lifeless figure of a dead image

156 The lovers of evil things deserve to have no better things to
trust in both they that make them and they that love them and they
that worship them

157 The potter also tempering soft earth with labour fashioneth
every vessel for our service and of the same clay he maketh both
vessels that are for clean uses and likewise such as serve to the
contrary but what is the use of these vessels the potter is the
judge

158 And of the same clay by a vain labour he maketh a god he who a
little before was made of earth himself and a little after returneth
to the same out of which he was taken when his life which was lent
him shall be called for again

159 But his care is not that he shall labour nor that his life is
short but he striveth with the goldsmiths and silversmiths and he
endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass and counteth it a glory
to make vain things

1510 For his heart is ashes and his hope vain earth and his life
more base than clay

1511 Forasmuch as he knew not his maker and him that inspired into
him the soul that worketh and that breathed into him a living spirit

1512 Yea and they have counted our life a pastime and the business
of life to be gain and that we must be getting every way even out of
evil

1513 For that man knoweth that he offendeth above all others who of
earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven gods

1514 But all the enemies of thy people that hold them in subjection
are foolish and unhappy and proud beyond measure

1515 For they have esteemed all the idols of the heathens for gods
which neither have the use of eyes to see nor noses to draw breath
nor ears to hear nor fingers of hands to handle and as for their
feet they are slow to walk

1516 For man made them and he that borroweth his own breath
fashioned them For no man can make a god like to himself

1517 For being mortal himself he formeth a dead thing with his
wicked hands For he is better than they whom he worshippeth because
he indeed hath lived though he were mortal but they never

1518 Moreover they worship also the vilest creatures but things
without sense compared to these are worse than they

1519 Yea neither by sight can any man see good of these beasts But
they have fled from the praise of God and from his blessing



Wisdom Chapter 16


Gods different dealings with the Egyptians and with his own people

161 For these things and by the like things to these they were
worthily punished and were destroyed by a multitude of beasts

162 Instead of which punishment dealing well with thy people thou
gavest them their desire of delicious food of a new taste preparing
for them quails for their meat

163 To the end that they indeed desiring food by means of those
things that were shewn and sent among them might loath even that which
was necessary to satisfy their desire But these after suffering want
for a short time tasted a new meat

They indeed desiring food etc  He means the Egyptians who were
restrained even from that food which was necessary by the frogs and
the flies that were sent amongst them and spoiled all their
meatsIbid But these  Viz the Israelites

164 For it was requisite that inevitable destruction should come upon
them that exercised tyranny but to these it should only be shewn how
their enemies were destroyed

165 For when the fierce rage of beasts came upon these they were
destroyed by the bitings of crooked serpents

166 But thy wrath endured not for ever but they were troubled for a
short time for their correction having a sign of salvation to put
them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law

Sign of salvation  The brazen serpent an emblem of Christ our
Saviour

167 For he that turned to it was not healed by that which he saw
but by thee the Saviour of all

168 And in this thou didst shew to our enemies that thou art he who
deliverest from all evil

169 For the bitings of locusts and of flies killed them and there
was found no remedy for their life because they were worthy to be
destroyed by such things

1610 But not even the teeth of venomous serpents overcame thy
children for thy mercy came and healed them

1611 For they were examined for the remembrance of thy words and
were quickly healed lest falling into deep forgetfulness they might
not be able to use thy help

1612 For it was neither herb nor mollifying plaster that healed
them but thy word O Lord which healeth all things

1613 For it is thou O Lord that hast power of life and death and
leadest down to the gates of death and bringest back again

1614 A man indeed killeth through malice and when the spirit is gone
forth it shall not return neither shall he call back the soul that is
received

1615 But it is impossible to escape thy hand

1616 For the wicked that denied to know thee were scourged by the
strength of thy arm being persecuted by strange waters and hail and
rain and consumed by fire

1617 And which was wonderful in water which extinguisheth all
things the fire had more force for the world fighteth for the just

The fire had more force  Viz when the fire and hail mingled
together laid waste the land of Egypt Ex 9

1618 For at one time the fire was mitigated that the beasts which
were sent against the wicked might not be burnt but that they might
see and perceive that they were persecuted by the judgment of God

1619 And at another time the fire above its own power burnt in the
midst of water to destroy the fruits of a wicked land

1620 Instead of which things thou didst feed thy people with the
food of angels and gavest them bread from heaven prepared without
labour having in it all that is delicious and the sweetness of every
taste

1621 For thy sustenance shewed thy sweetness to thy children and
serving every mans will it was turned to what every man liked

1622 But snow and ice endured the force of fire and melted not that
they might know that the fire burning in the hail and flashing in the
rain destroyed the fruits of the enemies

1623 But this same again that the just might be nourished did even
forget its own strength

1624 For the creature serving thee the Creator is made fierce
against the unjust for their punishment and abateth its strength for
the benefit of them that trust in thee

1625 Therefore even then it was transformed into all things and was
obedient to thy grace that nourisheth all according to the will of
them that desired it of thee

1626 That thy children O Lord whom thou lovedst might know that it
is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth men but thy word
preserveth them that believe in thee

1627 For that which could not be destroyed by fire being warmed with
a little sunbeam presently melted away

1628 That it might be known to all that we ought to prevent the sun
to bless thee and adore thee at the dawning of the light

1629 For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winters
ice and shall run off as unprofitable water



Wisdom Chapter 17


The Egyptian darkness

171 For thy judgments O Lord are great and thy words cannot be
expressed therefore undisciplined souls have erred

172 For while the wicked thought to be able to have dominion over the
holy nation they themselves being fettered with the bonds of darkness
and a long night shut up in their houses lay there exiled from the
eternal providence

173 And while they thought to lie hid in their obscure sins they
were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfullness being horribly
afraid and troubled with exceeding great astonishment

174 For neither did the den that held them keep them from fear for
noises coming down troubled them and sad visions appearing to them
affrighted them

175 And no power of fire could give them light neither could the
bright flames of the stars enlighten that horrible night

176 But there appeared to them a sudden fire very dreadful and
being struck with the fear of that face which was not seen they
thought the things which they saw to be worse

177 And the delusions of their magic art were put down and their
boasting of wisdom was reproachfully rebuked

178 For they who promised to drive away fears and troubles from a
sick soul were sick themselves of a fear worthy to be laughed at

179 For though no terrible thing disturbed them yet being scared
with the passing by of beasts and hissing of serpents they died for
fear and denying that they saw the air which could by no means be
avoided

1710 For whereas wickedness is fearful it beareth witness of its
condemnation for a troubled conscience always forecasteth grievous
things

1711 For fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from
thought

1712 And while there is less expectation from within the greater
doth it count the ignorance of that cause which bringeth the torment

1713 But they that during that night in which nothing could be done
and which came upon them from the lowest and deepest hell slept the
same sleep

1714 Were sometimes molested with the fear of monsters sometimes
fainted away their soul failing them for a sudden and unlooked for
fear was come upon them

1715 Moreover if any of them had fallen down he was kept shut up in
prison without irons

1716 For if any one were a husbandman or a shepherd or a labourer
in the field and was suddenly overtaken he endured a necessity from
which he could not fly

1717 For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness
Whether it were a whistling wind or the melodious voice of birds
among the spreading branches of trees or a fall of water running down
with violence

1718 Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down or the running that
could not be seen of beasts playing together or the roaring voice of
wild beasts or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains these
things made them to swoon for fear

1719 For the whole world was enlightened with a clear light and
none were hindered in their labours

1720 But over them only was spread a heavy night an image of that
darkness which was to come upon them But they were to themselves more
grievous than the darkness



Wisdom Chapter 18


The slaughter of the firstborn in Egypt the efficacy of Aarons
intercession in the sedition on occasion of Core

181 But thy saints had a very great light and they heard their voice
indeed but did not see their shape And because they also did not
suffer the same things they glorified thee

182 And they that before had been wronged gave thanks because they
were not hurt now and asked this gift that there might be a
difference

183 Therefore they received a burning pillar of fire for a guide of
the way which they knew not and thou gavest them a harmless sun of a
good entertainment

A harmless sun  A light that should not hurt or molest them but that
should be an agreeable guest to them

184 The others indeed were worthy to be deprived of light and
imprisoned in darkness who kept thy children shut up by whom the pure
light of the law was to be given to the world

185 And whereas they thought to kill the babes of the just one child
being cast forth and saved to reprove them thou tookest away a
multitude of their children and destroyedst them altogether in a
mighty water

One child  Viz Moses

186 For that night was known before by our fathers that assuredly
knowing what oaths they had trusted to they might be of better
courage

187 So thy people received the salvation of the just and destruction
of the unjust

188 For as thou didst punish the adversaries so thou didst also
encourage and glorify us

189 For the just children of good men were offering sacrifice
secretly and they unanimously ordered a law of justice that the just
should receive both good and evil alike singing now the praises of the
fathers

Of good men  Viz of the patriarchs Their children the Israelites
offered in private the sacrifice of the paschal lamb and were
regulating what they were to do in their journey when that last and
most dreadful plague was coming upon their enemies

1810 But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the
enemies and a lamentable mourning was heard for the children that were
bewailed

1811 And the servant suffered the same punishment as the master and
a common man suffered in like manner as the king

1812 So all alike had innumerable dead with one kind of death
Neither were the living sufficient to bury them for in one moment the
noblest offspring of them was destroyed

The noblest offspring  That is the firstborn

1813 For whereas they would not believe any thing before by reason of
the enchantments then first upon the destruction of the firstborn
they acknowledged the people to be of God

1814 For while all things were in quiet silence and the night was in
the midst of her course

1815 Thy Almighty word leaped down from heaven from thy royal throne
as a fierce conqueror into the midst of the land of destruction

1816 With a sharp sword carrying thy unfeigned commandment and he
stood and filled all things with death and standing on the earth
reached even to heaven

1817 Then suddenly visions of evil dreams troubled them and fears
unlooked for came upon them

1818 And one thrown here another there half dead shewed the cause
of his death

1819 For the visions that troubled them foreshewed these things lest
they should perish and not know why they suffered these evils

1820 But the just also were afterwards touched by an assault of
death and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the wilderness
but thy wrath did not long continue

1821 For a blameless man made haste to pry for the people bringing
forth the shield of his ministry prayer and by incense making
supplication withstood the wrath and put an end to the calamity
shewing that he was thy servant

1822 And he overcame the disturbance not by strength of body nor
with force of arms but with a word he subdued him that punished them
alleging the oath and covenant made with the fathers

1823 For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon
another he stood between and stayed the assault and cut off the way
to the living

1824 For in the priestly robe which he wore was the whole world and
in the four rows of the stones the glory of the fathers was graven
and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head

1826 And to these the destroyer gave place and was afraid of them
for the proof only of wrath was enough



Wisdom Chapter 19


Why God shewed no mercy to the Egyptians His favour to the Israelites
All creatures obey Gods orders for the service of the good and the
punishment of the wicked

191 But as to the wicked even to the end there came upon them wrath
without mercy For he knew before also what they would do

192 For when they had given them leave to depart and had sent them
away with great care they repented and pursued after them

193 For whilst they were yet mourning and lamenting at the graves of
the dead they took up another foolish device and pursued them as
fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone

194 For a necessity of which they were worthy brought them to this
end and they lost the remembrance of those things which had happened
that their punishment might fill up what was wanting to their torments

195 And that thy people might wonderfully pass through but they
might find a new death

196 For every creature according to its kind was fashioned again as
from the beginning obeying thy commandments that thy children might
be kept without hurt

197 For a cloud overshadowed their camps and where water was before
dry land appeared and in the Red Sea a way without hindrance and out
of the great deep a springing field

198 Through which all the nation passed which was protected with thy
hand seeing thy miracles and wonders

199 For they fed on their food like horses and they skipped like
lambs praising thee O Lord who hadst delivered them

1910 For they were yet mindful of those things which had been done in
the time of their sojourning how the ground brought forth flies
instead of cattle and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs
instead of fishes

1911 And at length they saw a new generation of birds when being led
by their appetite they asked for delicate meats

1912 For to satisfy their desire the quail came up to them from the
sea and punishments came upon the sinners not without foregoing signs
by the force of thunders for they suffered justly according to their
own wickedness

1913 For they exercised a more detestable inhospitality than any
others indeed received not strangers unknown to them but these brought
their guests into bondage that had deserved well of them

1914 And not only so but in another respect also they were worse
for the others against their will received the strangers

1915 But these grievously afflicted them whom they had received with
joy and who lived under the same laws

1916 But they were struck with blindness as those others were at the
doors of the just man when they were covered with sudden darkness and
every one sought the passage of his own door

1917 For while the elements are changed in themselves as in an
instrument the sound of the quality is changed yet all keep their
sound which may clearly be perceived by the very sight

Elements are changed etc  The meaning is that whatever changes God
wrought in the elements by miracles in favour of his people they still
kept their harmony by obeying his will

1918 For the things of the land were turned into things of the water
and the things that before swam in the water passed upon the land

1919 The fire had power in water above its own virtue and the water
forgot its quenching nature

1920 On the other side the flames wasted not the flesh of
corruptible animals walking therein neither did they melt that good
food which was apt to melt as ice For in all things thou didst
magnify thy people O Lord and didst honour them and didst not
despise them but didst assist them at all times and in every place

That good food  The manna




ECCLESIASTICUS



This Book is so called from a Greek word that signifies a preacher
because like an excellent preacher it gives admirable lessons of all
virtues The author was Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem who
flourished about two hundred years before Christ As it was written
after the time of Esdras it is not in the Jewish canon but is
received as canonical and divine by the Catholic Church instructed by
apostolical tradition and directed by the spirit of God It was first
written in the Hebrew but afterwards translated into Greek by another
Jesus the grandson of the author whose prologue to this book is the
following



THE PROLOGUE


The knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us by the law
and the prophets and others that have followed them for which things
Israel is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom because not only
they that speak must needs be skilful but strangers also both
speaking and writing may by their means become most learned My
grandfather Jesus after he had much given himself to a diligent
reading of the law and the prophets and other books that were
delivered to us from our fathers had a mind also to write something
himself pertaining to doctrine and wisdom that such as are desirous
to learn and are made knowing in these things may be more and more
attentive in mind and be strengthened to live according to the law I
entreat you therefore to come with benevolence and to read with
attention and to pardon us for those things wherein we may seem while
we follow the image of wisdom to come short in the composition of
words for the Hebrew words have not the same force in them when
translated into another tongue And not only these but the law also
itself and the prophets and the rest of the books have no small
difference when they are spoken in their own language For in the
eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt when Ptolemy Evergetes was
king and continuing there a long time I found there books left of no
small nor contemptible learning Therefore I thought it good and
necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this
book and with much watching and study in some space of time I brought
the book to an end and set it forth for the service of them that are
willing to apply their mind and to learn how they ought to conduct
themselves who purpose to lead their life according to the law of the
Lord



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 1


All wisdom is from God and is given to them that fear and love God

11 All wisdom is from the Lord God and hath been always with him
and is before all time

12 Who hath numbered the sand of the sea and the drops of rain and
the days of the world Who hath measured the height of heaven and the
breadth of the earth and the depth of the abyss

13 Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before all
things

14 Wisdom hath been created before all things and the understanding
of prudence from everlasting

15 The word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom and her ways
are everlasting commandments

16 To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed and who hath known
her wise counsels

17 To whom hath the discipline of wisdom been revealed and made
manifest and who hath understood the multiplicity of her steps

18 There is one most high Creator Almighty and a powerful king and
greatly to be feared who sitteth upon his throne and is the God of
dominion

19 He created her in the Holy Ghost and saw her and numbered her
and measured her

110 And he poured her out upon all his works and upon all flesh
according to his gift and hath given her to them that love him

111 The fear of the Lord is honour and glory and gladness and a
crown of joy

112 The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart and shall give joy
and gladness and length of days

113 With him that feareth the Lord it shall go well in the latter
end and in the day of his death he shall be blessed

114 The love of God is honourable wisdom

115 And they to whom she shall shew herself love her by the sight
and by the knowledge of her great works

116 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and was created
with the faithful in the womb it walketh with chosen women and is
known with the just and faithful

117 The fear of the Lord is the religiousness of knowledge

118 Religiousness shall keep and justify the heart it shall give joy
and gladness

119 It shall go well with him that feareth the Lord and in the days
of his end he shall be blessed

120 To fear God is the fulness of wisdom and fulness is from the
fruits thereof

121 She shall fill all her house with her increase and the
storehouses with her treasures

122 The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom filling up peace and
the fruit of salvation

123 And it hath seen and numbered her but both are the gifts of
God

124 Wisdom shall distribute knowledge and understanding of prudence
and exalteth the glory of them that hold her

125 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord and the branches thereof
are longlived

126 In the treasures of wisdom is understanding and religiousness of
knowledge but to sinners wisdom is an abomination

127 The fear of the Lord driveth out sin

128 For he that is without fear cannot be justified for the wrath
of his high spirits is his ruin

129 A patient man shall bear for a time and afterwards joy shall be
restored to him

130 A good understanding will hide his words for a time and the lips
of many shall declare his wisdom

131 In the treasures of wisdom is the signification of discipline

132 But the worship of God is an abomination to a sinner

133 Son if thou desire wisdom keep justice and God will give her
to thee

134 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline and that which
is agreeable to him

135 Is faith and meekness and he will fill up his treasures

136 Be not incredulous to the fear of the Lord and come not to him
with a double heart

137 Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men and let not thy lips be a
stumblingblock to thee

138 Watch over them lest thou fall and bring dishonour upon thy
soul

139 And God discover thy secrets and cast thee down in the midst of
the congregation

140 Because thou camest to the Lord wickedly and thy heart is full
of guile and deceit



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 2


Gods servants must look for temptations and must arm themselves with
patience and confidence in God

21 Son when thou comest to the service of God stand in justice and
in fear and prepare thy soul for temptation

22 Humble thy heart and endure incline thy ear and receive the
words of understanding and make not haste in the time of clouds

23 Wait on God with patience join thyself to God and endure that
thy life may be increased in the latter end

24 Take all that shall be brought upon thee and in thy sorrow
endure and in thy humiliation keep patience

25 For gold and silver are tried in the fire but acceptable men in
the furnace of humiliation

26 Believe God and he will recover thee and direct thy way and
trust in him Keep his fear and grow old therein

27 Ye that fear the Lord wait for his mercy and go not aside from
him lest ye fall

28 Ye that fear the Lord believe him and your reward shall not be
made void

29 Ye that fear the Lord hope in him and mercy shall come to you for
your delight

210 Ye that fear the Lord love him and your hearts shall be
enlightened

211 My children behold the generations of men and know ye that no
one hath hoped in the Lord and hath been confounded

212 For who hath continued in his commandment and hath been
forsaken or who hath called upon him and he despised him

213 For God is compassionate and merciful and will forgive sins in
the day of tribulation and he is a protector to all that seek him in
truth

214 Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips and to
the hands that do evil and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two
ways

215 Woe to them that are fainthearted who believe not God and
therefore they shall not be protected by him

216 Woe to them that have lost patience and that have forsaken the
right ways and have gone aside into crooked ways

217 And what will they do when the Lord shall begin to examine

218 They that fear the Lord will not be incredulous to his word and
they that love him will keep his way

219 They that fear the Lord will seek after the things that are well
pleasing to him and they that love him shall be filled with his law

220 They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts and in his
sight will sanctify their souls

221 They that fear the Lord keep his commandments and will have
patience even until his visitation

222 Saying If we do not penance we shall fall into the hands of the
Lord and not into the hands of men

223 For according to his greatness so also is his mercy with him



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 3


Lessons concerning the honour of parents and humility and avoiding
curiosity

31 The sons of wisdom are the church of the just and their
generation obedience and love

32 Children hear the judgment of your father and so do that you may
be saved

33 For God hath made the father honourable to the children and
seeking the judgment of the mothers hath confirmed it upon the
children

34 He that loveth God shall obtain pardon for his sins by prayer
and shall refrain himself from them and shall be heard in the prayer
of days

35 And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a
treasure

36 He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children
and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard

37 He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life and he that
obeyeth the father shall be a comfort to his mother

38 He that feareth the Lord honoureth his parents and will serve
them as his masters that brought him into the world

39 Honour thy father in work and word and all patience

310 That a blessing may come upon thee from him and his blessing may
remain in the latter end

311 The fathers blessing establisheth the houses of the children
but the mothers curse rooteth up the foundation

312 Glory not in the dishonour of thy father for his shame is no
glory to thee

313 For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father and a
father without honour is the disgrace of the son

314 Son support the old age of thy father and grieve him not in his
life

315 And if his understanding fail have patience with him and
despise him not when thou art in thy strength for the relieving of the
father shall not be forgotten

316 For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother

317 And in justice thou shalt be built up and in the day of
affliction thou shalt be remembered and thy sins shall melt away as
the ice in the fair warm weather

318 Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father and he is
cursed of God that angereth his mother

319 My son do thy works in meekness and thou shalt be beloved above
the glory of men

320 The greater thou art the more humble thyself in all things and
thou shalt find grace before God

321 For great is the power of God alone and he is honoured by the
humble

322 Seek not the things that are too high for thee and search not
into things above thy ability but the things that God hath commanded
thee think on them always and in many of his works be not curious

323 For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those
things that are hid

324 In unnecessary matters be not over curious and in many of his
works thou shalt not be inquisitive

325 For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men

326 And the suspicion of them hath deceived many and hath detained
their minds in vanity

327 A hard heart shall fear evil at the last and he that loveth
danger shall perish in it

328 A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success and the
perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein

329 A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows and the sinner will
add sin to sin

330 The congregation of the proud shall not be healed for the plant
of wickedness shall take root in them and it shall not be perceived

331 The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom and a good ear
will hear wisdom with all desire

332 A wise heart and which hath understanding will abstain from
sins and in the works of justice shall have success

333 Water quencheth a flaming fire and alms resisteth sins

334 And God provideth for him that sheweth favour he remembereth him
afterwards and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 4


An exhortation to works of mercy and to the love of wisdom

41 Son defraud not the poor of alms and turn not away thy eyes from
the poor

42 Despise not the hungry soul and provoke not the poor in his want

43 Afflict not the heart of the needy and defer not to gibe to him
that is in distress

44 Reject not the petition of the afflicted and turn not away thy
face from the needy

45 Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger and leave
not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back

46 For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his
soul shall be heard for he that made him will hear him

47 Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor and humble
thy soul to the ancient and bow thy head to a great man

48 Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor and pay what thou owest
and answer him peaceable words with mildness

49 Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud and
be not fainthearted in thy soul

410 In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father and as a
husband to their mother

411 And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High and he
will have mercy on thee more than a mother

412 Wisdom inspireth life into her children and protecteth them that
seek after her and will go before them in the way of justice

413 And he that loveth her loveth life and they that watch for her
shall embrace her sweetness

414 They that hold her fast shall inherit life and whithersoever
she entereth God will give a blessing

415 They that serve her shall be servants to the holy one and God
loveth them that love her

416 He that hearkeneth to her shall judge nations and he that
looketh upon her shall remain secure

417 If he trust to her he shall inherit her and his generation
shall be in assurance

418 For she walketh with him in temptation and at the first she
chooseth him

In temptation etc  The meaning is that before wisdom will choose
any for her favourite she will try them by leading them through
contradictions afflictions and temptations the usual noviceship of
the children of God

419 She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial and she will
scourge him with the affliction of her discipline till she try him by
her laws and trust his soul

420 Then she will strengthen him and make a straight way to him and
give him joy

421 And will disclose her secrets to him and will heap upon him
treasures of knowledge and understanding of justice

422 But if he go astray she will forsake him and deliver him into
the hands of his enemy

423 Son observe the time and fly from evil

424 For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth

425 For there is a shame that bringeth sin and there is a shame that
bringeth glory and grace

426 Accept no person against thy own person nor against thy soul a
lie

427 Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall

428 And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation Hide not thy
wisdom in her beauty

429 For by the tongue wisdom is discerned and understanding and
knowledge and learning by the word of the wise and steadfastness in
the works of justice

430 In nowise speak against the truth but be ashamed of the lie of
thy ignorance

431 Be not ashamed to confess thy sins but submit not thyself to
every man for sin

432 Resist not against the face of the mighty and do not strive
against the stream of the river

433 Strive for justice for thy soul and even unto death fight for
justice and God will overthrow thy enemies for thee

434 Be not hasty in thy tongue and slack and remiss in thy works

435 Be not as a lion in thy house terrifying them of thy household
and oppressing them that are under thee

436 Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive and shut when thou
shouldst give



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 5


We must not presume of our wealth or strength nor of the mercy of God
to go on in sin we must be steadfast in virtue and truth

51 Set not thy heart upon unjust possessions and say not I have
enough to live on for it shall be of no service in the time of
vengeance and darkness

52 Follow not in thy strength the desires of thy heart

53 And say not How mighty am I and who shall bring me under for my
deeds for God will surely take revenge

54 Say not I have sinned and what harm hath befallen me for the
most High is a patient rewarder

55 Be not without fear about sin forgiven and add not sin upon sin

56 And say not The mercy of the Lord is great he will have mercy on
the multitude of my sins

57 For mercy and wrath quickly come from him and his wrath looketh
upon sinners

58 Delay not to be converted to the Lord and defer it not from day
to day

59 For his wrath shall come on a sudden and in the time of vengeance
he will destroy thee

510 Be not anxious for goods unjustly gotten for they shall not
profit thee in the day of calamity and revenge

511 Winnow not with every wind and go not into every way for so is
every sinner proved by a double tongue

512 Be steadfast in the way of the Lord and in the truth of thy
judgment and in knowledge and let the word of peace and justice keep
with thee

513 Be meek to hear the word that thou mayst understand and return
a true answer with wisdom

514 If thou have understanding answer thy neighbour but if not let
thy hand be upon thy mouth lest thou be surprised in an unskilful
word and be confounded

515 Honour and glory is in the word of the wise but the tongue of
the fool is his ruin

516 Be not called a whisperer and be not taken in thy tongue and
confounded

517 For confusion and repentance is upon a thief and an evil mark of
disgrace upon the double tongued but to the whisperer hatred and
enmity and reproach

518 Justify alike the small and the great



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 6


Of true and false friends and of the of the fruits of wisdom

61 Instead of a friend become not an enemy to thy neighbour for an
evil man shall inherit reproach and shame so shall every sinner that
is envious and double tongued

62 Extol not thyself in the thoughts of thy soul like a bull lest
thy strength be quashed by folly

63 And it eat up thy leaves and destroy thy fruit and thou be left
as a dry tree in the wilderness

64 For a wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it and maketh him
to be a joy to his enemies and shall lead him into the lot of the
wicked

65 A sweet word multiplieth friends and appeaseth enemies and a
gracious tongue in a good man aboundeth

66 Be in peace with many but let one of a thousand be thy
counsellor

67 If thou wouldst get a friend try him before thou takest him and
do not credit him easily

68 For there is a friend for his own occasion and he will not abide
in the day of thy trouble

69 And there is a friend that turneth to enmity and there is a
friend that will disclose hatred and strife and reproaches

610 And there is a friend a companion at the table and he will not
abide in the day of distress

611 A friend if he continue steadfast shall be to thee as thyself
and shall act with confidence among them of thy household

612 If he humble himself before thee and hide himself from thy face
thou shalt have unanimous friendship for good

613 Separate thyself from thy enemies and take heed of thy friends

614 A faithful friend is a strong defence and he that hath found
him hath found a treasure

615 Nothing can be compared to a faithful friend and no weight of
gold and silver is able to countervail the goodness of his fidelity

616 A faithful friend is the medicine of life and immortality and
they that fear the Lord shall find him

617 He that feareth God shall likewise have good friendship because
according to him shall his friend be

618 My son from thy youth up receive instruction and even to thy
grey hairs thou shalt find wisdom

619 Come to her as one that plougheth and soweth and wait for her
good fruits

620 For in working about her thou shalt labour a little and shalt
quickly eat of her fruits

621 How very unpleasant is wisdom to the unlearned and the unwise
will not continue with her

622 She shall be to them as a mighty stone of trial and they will
cast her from them before it be long

623 For the wisdom of doctrine is according to her name and she is
not manifest unto many but with them to whom she is known she
continueth even to the sight of God

624 Give ear my son and take wise counsel and cast not away my
advice

625 Put thy feet into her fetters and thy neck into her chains

626 Bow down thy shoulder and bear her and be not grieved with her
bands

627 Come to her with all thy mind and keep her ways with all thy
power

628 Search for her and she shall be made known to thee and when
thou hast gotten her let her not go

629 For in the latter end thou shalt find rest in her and she shall
be turned to thy joy

630 Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee and a firm
foundation and her chain a robe of glory

631 For in her is the beauty of life and her bands are a healthful
binding

632 Thou shalt put her on as a robe of glory and thou shalt set her
upon thee as a crown of joy

633 My son if thou wilt attend to me thou shalt learn and if thou
wilt apply thy mind thou shalt be wise

634 If thou wilt incline thy ear thou shalt receive instruction and
if thou love to hear thou shalt be wise

635 Stand in the multitude of ancients that are wise and join
thyself from thy heart to their wisdom that thou mayst hear every
discourse of God and the sayings of praise may not escape thee

636 And if thou see a man of understanding go to him early in the
morning and let thy foot wear the steps of his doors

637 Let thy thoughts be upon the precepts of God and meditate
continually on his commandments and he will give thee a heart and the
desire of wisdom shall be given to thee



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 7

honour

75 Justify not thyself before God for he knoweth the heart and

is not good

the word in thy prayer

Repeat not etc  Make not much babbling by repetition of words but
aim more at fervour of heart

716 Hate not laborious works nor husbandry ordained by the most
High

717 Number not thyself among the multitude of the disorderly

718 Remember wrath for it will not tarry long

719 Humble thy spirit very much for the vengeance on the flesh of
the ungodly is fire and worms

720 Do not transgress against thy friend deferring money nor despise
thy dear brother for the sake of gold

721 Depart not from a wise and good wife whom thou hast gotten in
the fear of the Lord for the grace of her modesty is above gold

722 Hurt not the servant that worketh faithfully nor the hired man
that giveth thee his life

723 Let a wise servant be dear to thee as thy own soul defraud him
not of liberty nor leave him needy

724 Hast thou cattle have an eye to them and if they be for thy
profit keep them with thee

725 Hast thou children instruct them and bow down their neck from
their childhood

726 Hast thou daughters have a care of their body and shew not thy
countenance gay towards them

727 Marry thy daughter well and thou shalt do a great work and give
her to a wise man

728 If thou hast a wife according to thy soul cast her not off and
to her that is hateful trust not thyself With thy whole heart

a return to them as they have done for thee

731 With all thy soul fear the Lord and reverence his priests

732 With all thy strength love him that made thee and forsake not
his ministers

733 Honour God with all thy soul and give honour to the priests and
purify thyself with thy arms

firstfruits and of purifications and for thy negligences purify
thyself with a few

735 Offer to the Lord the gift of thy shoulders and the sacrifice of
sanctification and the firstfruits of the holy things

736 And stretch out thy hand to the poor that thy expiation and thy
blessing may be perfected

737 A gift hath grace in the sight of all the living and restrain
not grace from the dead

And restrain not grace from the dead  That is withhold not from them
the benefit of alms prayers and sacrifices Such was the doctrine and
practice of the church of God even in the time of the Old Testament
And the same has always been continued from the days of the apostles in
the church of the New Testament

738 Be not wanting in comforting them that weep and walk with them
that mourn

739 Be not slow to visit the sick for by these things thou shalt be

to her lest thou perish by the force of her charms

95 Gaze not upon a maiden lest her beauty be a stumblingblock to
thee

96 Give not thy soul to harlots in any point lest thou destroy
thyself and thy inheritance

97 Look not round about thee in the ways of the city nor wander up
and down in the streets thereof

98 Turn away thy face from a woman dressed up and gaze not about
upon anothers beauty

99 For many have perished by the beauty of a woman and hereby lust
is enkindled as a fire

910 Every woman that is a harlot shall be trodden upon as dung in
the way

911 Many by admiring the beauty of another mans wife have become
reprobate for her conversation burneth as fire

with her

913 And strive not with her over wine lest thy heart decline towards

Ecclesiasticus Chapter 10


The virtues and vices of men in power the great evil of pride

101 A wise judge shall judge his people and the government of a
prudent man shall be steady

Judge his people  In the Greek it is instruct his people

102 As the judge of the people is himself so also are his ministers
and what manner of man the ruler of a city is such also are they that
dwell therein

103 An unwise king shall be the ruin of his people and cities shall
be inhabited through the prudence of the rulers

104 The power of the earth is in the hand of God and in his time he
will raise up a profitable ruler over it

105 The prosperity of man is in the hand of God and upon the person
of the scribe he shall lay his honour

The scribe  That is the man that is wise and learned in the law

106 Remember not any injury done thee by thy neighbour and do thou
nothing by deeds of injury

107 Pride is hateful before God and men and all iniquity of nations
is execrable

108 A kingdom is translated from one people to another because of
injustices and wrongs and injuries and divers deceits

109 But nothing is more wicked than the covetous man Why is earth
and ashes proud

1010 There is not a more wicked thing than to love money for such a
one setteth even his own soul to sale because while he liveth he hath
cast away his bowels

1011 All power is of short life A long sickness is troublesome to
the physician

1012 The physician cutteth off a short sickness so also a king is to
day and to morrow he shall die

1013 For when a man shall die he shall inherit serpents and beasts
and worms

1014 The beginning of the pride of man is to fall off from God

1015 Because his heart is departed from him that made him for pride
is the beginning of all sin he that holdeth it shall be filled with
maledictions and it shall ruin him in the end

1016 Therefore hath the Lord disgraced the assemblies of the wicked
and hath utterly destroyed them

1017 God hath overturned the thrones of proud princes and hath set
up the meek in their stead

1018 God hath made the roots of proud nations to wither and hath
planted the humble of these nations

1019 The Lord hath overthrown the lands of the Gentiles and hath
destroyed them even to the foundation

1020 He hath made some of them to wither away and hath destroyed
them and hath made the memory of them to cease from the earth

1021 God hath abolished the memory of the proud and hath preserved
the memory of them that are humble in mind

1022 Pride was not made for men nor wrath for the race of women

1023 That seed of men shall be honoured which feareth God but that
seed shall be dishonoured which transgresseth the commandments of the
Lord

1024 In the midst of brethren their chief is honourable so shall
they that fear the Lord be in his eyes

1025 The fear of God is the glory of the rich and of the honourable
and of the poor

1026 Despise not a just man that is poor and do not magnify a sinful
man that is rich

1027 The great man and the judge and the mighty is in honour and
there is none greater than he that feareth God

1028 They that are free shall serve a servant that is wise and a man
that is prudent and well instructed will not murmur when he is
reproved and he that is ignorant shall not be honoured

1029 Extol not thyself in doing thy work and linger not in the time
of distress

1030 Better is he that laboureth and aboundeth in all things than
he that boasteth himself and wanteth bread

1031 My son keep thy soul in meekness and give it honour according
to its desert

1032 Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul and who
will honour him that dishonoureth his own soul

1033 The poor man is glorified by his discipline and fear and there
is a man that is honoured for his wealth

1034 But he that is glorified in poverty how much more in wealth
and he that is glorified in wealth let him fear poverty



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 11


Lessons of humility and moderation in all things

111 The wisdom of the humble shall exalt his head and shall make him
sit in the midst of great men

112 Praise not a man for his beauty neither despise a man for his
look

113 The bee is small among flying things but her fruit hath the
chiefest sweetness

114 Glory not in apparel at any time and be not exalted in the day
of thy honour for the works of the Highest only are wonderful and his
works are glorious and secret and hidden

115 Many tyrants have sat on the throne and he whom no man would
think on hath worn the crown

116 Many mighty men have been greatly brought down and the glorious
have been delivered into the hand of others

117 Before thou inquire blame no man and when thou hast inquired
reprove justly

118 Before thou hear answer not a word and interrupt not others in
the midst of their discourse

119 Strive not in a matter which doth not concern thee and sit not
in judgment with sinners

1110 My son meddle not with many matters and if thou be rich thou
shalt not be free from sin for if thou pursue after thou shalt not
overtake and if thou run before thou shalt not escape

1111 There is an ungodly man that laboureth and maketh haste and is
in sorrow and is so much the more in want

1112 Again there is an inactive man that wanteth help is very weak
in ability and full of poverty

1113 Yet the eye of God hath looked upon him for good and hath
lifted him up from his low estate and hath exalted his head and many
have wondered at him and have glorified God

1114 Good things and evil life and death poverty and riches are
from God

1115 Wisdom and discipline and the knowledge of the law are with
God Love and the ways of good things are with him

1116 Error and darkness are created with sinners and they that glory
in evil things grow old in evil

1117 The gift of God abideth with the just and his advancement shall
have success for ever

1118 There is one that is enriched by living sparingly and this is
the portion of his reward

1119 In that he saith I have found me rest and now I will eat of my
goods alone

1120 And he knoweth not what time shall pass and that death
approacheth and that he must leave all to others and shall die

1121 Be steadfast in thy covenant and be conversant therein and
grow old in the work of thy commandments

1122 Abide not in the works of sinners But trust in God and stay in
thy place

1123 For it is easy in the eyes of God on a sudden to make the poor
man rich

1124 The blessing of God maketh haste to reward the just and in a
swift hour his blessing beareth fruit

1125 Say not What need I and what good shall I have by this

1126 Say not I am sufficient for myself and what shall I be made
worse by this

1127 In the day of good things be not unmindful of evils and in the
day of evils be not unmindful of good things

1128 For it is easy before God in the day of death to reward every
one according to his ways

1129 The affliction of an hour maketh one forget great delights and
in the end of a man is the disclosing of his works

1130 Praise not any man before death for a man is known by his
children

1131 Bring not every man into thy house for many are the snares of
the deceitful

1132 For as corrupted bowels send forth stinking breath and as the
partridge is brought into the cage and as the roe into the snare so
also is the heart of the proud and as a spy that looketh on the fall
of his neighbour

1133 For he lieth in wait and turneth good into evil and on the
elect he will lay a blot

1134 Of one spark cometh a great fire and of one deceitful man much
blood and a sinful man lieth in wait for blood

1135 Take heed to thyself of a mischievous man for he worketh evils
lest he bring upon thee reproach for ever

1136 Receive a stranger in and he shall overthrow thee with a
whirlwind and shall turn thee out of thy own



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 12


We are to be liberal to the just and not to trust the wicked

121 If thou do good know to whom thou dost it and there shall be
much thanks for thy good deeds

122 Do good to the just and thou shalt find great recompense and if
not of him assuredly of the Lord

123 For there is no good for him that is always occupied in evil and
that giveth no alms for the Highest hateth sinners and hath mercy on
the penitent

124 Give to the merciful and uphold not the sinner God will repay
vengeance to the ungodly and to sinners and keep them against the day
of vengeance

125 Give to the good and receive not a sinner

126 Do good to the humble and give not to the ungodly hold back thy
bread and give it not to him lest thereby he overmaster thee

127 For thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou
shalt have done to him for the Highest also hateth sinners and will
repay vengeance to the ungodly

128 A friend shall not be known in prosperity and an enemy shall not
be hidden in adversity

129 In the prosperity of a man his enemies are grieved and a friend
is known in his adversity

1210 Never trust thy enemy for as a brass pot his wickedness rusteth

1211 Though he humble himself and go crouching yet take good heed
and beware of him

1212 Set him not by thee neither let him sit on thy right hand lest
he turn into thy place and seek to take thy seat and at the last thou
acknowledge my words and be pricked with my sayings

1213 Who will pity an enchanter struck by a serpent or any that come
near wild beasts so is it with him that keepeth company with a wicked
man and is involved in his sins

1214 For an hour he will abide with thee but if thou begin to
decline he will not endure it

1215 An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips but in his heart he
lieth in wait to throw thee into a pit

1216 An enemy weepeth with his eyes but if he find an opportunity he
will not be satisfied with blood

1217 And if evils come upon thee thou shalt find him there first

1218 An enemy hath tears in his eyes and while he pretendeth to help
thee will undermine thy feet

1219 He will shake his head and clap his hands and whisper much
and change his countenance



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 13


Cautions in the choice of company

131 He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled with it and he that
hath fellowship with the proud shall put on pride

132 He shall take a burden upon him that hath fellowship with one
more honourable than himself And have no fellowship with one that is
richer than thyself

133 What agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle for if
they knock one against the other it shall be broken

134 The rich man hath done wrong and yet he will fume but the poor
is wronged and must hold his peace

135 If thou give he will make use of thee and if thou have nothing
he will forsake thee

136 If thou have any thing he will live with thee and will make
thee bare and he will not be sorry for thee

137 If he have need of thee he will deceive thee and smiling upon
thee will put thee in hope he will speak thee fair and will say What
wantest thou

138 And he will shame thee by his meats till he have drawn thee dry
twice or thrice and at last he will laugh at thee and afterward when
he seeth thee he will forsake thee and shake his head at thee

139 Humble thyself to God and wait for his hands

1310 Beware that thou be not deceived into folly and be humbled

1311 Be not lowly in thy wisdom lest being humbled thou be deceived
into folly

1312 If thou be invited by one that is mightier withdraw thyself
for so he will invite thee the more

1313 Be not troublesome to him lest thou be put back and keep not
far from him lest thou be forgotten

1314 Affect not to speak with him as an equal and believe not his
many words for by much talk he will sift thee and smiling will
examine thee concerning thy secrets

1315 His cruel mind will lay up thy words and he will not spare to
do thee hurt and to cast thee into prison

1316 Take heed to thyself and attend diligently to what thou
hearest for thou walkest in danger of thy ruin

1317 When thou hearest those things see as it were in sleep and
thou shalt awake

1318 Love God all thy life and call upon him for thy salvation

1319 Every beast loveth its like so also every man him that is
nearest to himself

1320 All flesh shall consort with the like to itself and every man
shall associate himself to his like

1321 If the wolf shall at any time have fellowship with the lamb so
the sinner with the just

1322 What fellowship hath a holy man with a dog or what part hath
the rich with the poor

1323 The wild ass is the lions prey in the desert so also the poor
are devoured by the rich

1324 And as humility is an abomination to the proud so also the rich
man abhorreth the poor

1325 When a rich man is shaken he is kept up by his friends but
when a poor man is fallen down he is thrust away even by his
acquaintance

1326 When a rich man hath been deceived he hath many helpers he
hath spoken proud things and they have justified him

1327 The poor man was deceived and he is rebuked also he hath
spoken wisely and could have no place

1328 The rich man spoke and all held their peace and what he said
they extol even to the clouds

1329 The poor man spoke and they say Who is this and if he
stumble they will overthrow him

1330 Riches are good to him that hath no sin in his conscience and
poverty is very wicked in the mouth of the ungodly

1331 The heart of a man changeth his countenance either for good or
for evil

1332 The token of a good heart and a good countenance thou shalt
hardly find and with labour



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 14


The evil of avarice works of mercy are recommended and the love of
wisdom

141 Blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of his
mouth and is not pricked with the remorse of sin

142 Happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind and who is not
fallen from his hope

143 Riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard and what
should an envious man do with gold

144 He that gathereth together by wronging his own soul gathereth
for others and another will squander away his goods in rioting

145 He that is evil to himself to whom will he be good and he shall
not take pleasure in his goods

146 There is none worse than he that envieth himself and this is the
reward of his wickedness

147 And if he do good he doth it ignorantly and unwillingly and at
the last he discovereth his wickedness

148 The eye of the envious is wicked and he turneth away his face
and despiseth his own soul

149 The eye of the covetous man is insatiable in his portion of
iniquity he will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul drying
it up

1410 An evil eye is towards evil things and he shall not have his
fill of bread but shall be needy and pensive at his own table

1411 My son if thou have any thing do good to thyself and offer to
God worthy offerings

1412 Remember that death is not slow and that the covenant of hell
hath been shewn to thee for the covenant of this world shall surely
die

Covenant of hell  The decree by which all are to go down to the
regions of death

1413 Do good to thy friend before thou die and according to thy
ability stretching out thy hand give to the poor

1414 Defraud not thyself of the good day and let not the part of a
good gift overpass thee

1415 Shalt thou not leave to others to divide by lot thy sorrows and
labours

1416 Give and take and justify thy soul

1417 Before thy death work justice for in hell there is no finding
food

1418 All flesh shall fade as grass and as the leaf that springeth
out on a green tree

1419 Some grow and some fall off so is the generation of flesh and
blood one cometh to an end and another is born

1420 Every work that is corruptible shall fail in the end and the
worker thereof shall go with it

1421 And every excellent work shall be justified and the worker
thereof shall be honoured therein

1422 Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom and that shall
meditate in his justice and in his mind shall think of the all seeing
eye of God

1423 He that considereth her ways in his heart and hath
understanding in her secrets who goeth after her as one that traceth
and stayeth in her ways

1424 He who looketh in at her windows and hearkeneth at her door

1425 He that lodgeth near her house and fastening a pin in her walls
shall set up his tent high unto her where good things shall rest in
his lodging for ever

1426 He shall set his children under her shelter and shall lodge
under her branches

1427 He shall be protected under her covering from the heat and
shall rest in her glory



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 15


Wisdom embraceth them that fear God God is not the author of sin

151 He that feareth God will do good and he that possesseth
justice shall lay hold on her

152 And she will meet him as an honourable mother and will receive
him as a wife married of a virgin

153 With the bread of life and understanding she shall feed him and
give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink and she shall be made
strong in him and he shall not be moved

154 And she shall hold him fast and he shall not be confounded and
she shall exalt him among his neighbours

155 And in the midst of the church she shall open his mouth and
shall fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding and shall
clothe him with a robe of glory

156 She shall heap upon him a treasure of joy and gladness and shall
cause him to inherit an everlasting name

157 But foolish men shall not obtain her and wise men shall meet
her foolish men shall not see her for she is far from pride and
deceit

158 Lying men shall be mindful of her but men that speak truth shall
be found with her and shall advance even till they come to the sight
of God

159 Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner

1510 For wisdom came forth from God for praise shall be with the
wisdom of God and shall abound in a faithful mouth and the sovereign
Lord will give praise unto it

1511 Say not It is through God that she is not with me for do not
thou the things that he hateth

1512 Say not He hath caused me to err for he hath no need of wicked
men

1513 The Lord hateth all abomination of error and they that fear him
shall not love it

1514 God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his
own counsel

1515 He added his commandments and precepts

1516 If thou wilt keep the commandments and perform acceptable
fidelity for ever they shall preserve thee

1517 He hath set water and fire before thee stretch forth thy hand
to which thou wilt

1518 Before man is life and death good and evil that which he shall
choose shall be given him

1519 For the wisdom of God is great and he is strong in power
seeing all men without ceasing

1520 The eyes of the Lord are towards them that fear him and he
knoweth al the work of man

1521 He hath commanded no man to do wickedly and he hath given no
man license to sin

1522 For he desireth not a multitude of faithless and unprofitable
children



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 16


It is better to have none than many wicked children Of the justice and
mercy of God His ways are unsearchable

161 Rejoice not in ungodly children if they be multiplied neither
be delighted in them if the fear of God be not with them

162 Trust not to their life and respect not their labours

163 For better is one that feareth God than a thousand ungodly
children

164 And it is better to die without children than to leave ungodly
children

165 By one that is wise a country shall be inhabited the tribe of
the ungodly shall become desolate

166 Many such things hath my eyes seen and greater things than these
my ear hath heard

167 In the congregation of sinners a fire shall be kindled and in an
unbelieving nation wrath shall flame out

168 The ancient giants did not obtain pardon for their sins who were
destroyed trusting to their own strength

169 And he spared not the place where Lot sojourned but abhorred
them for the pride of their word

1610 He had not pity on them destroying the whole nation that
extolled themselves in their sins

1611 So did he with the six hundred thousand footmen who were
gathered together in the hardness of their heart and if one had been
stiffnecked it is a wonder if he had escaped unpunished

Six hundred thousand footmen etc  Viz the children of Israel whom
he sentenced to die in the wilderness Num 14

1612 For mercy and wrath are with him He is mighty to forgive and
to pour out indignation

1613 According as his mercy is so his correction judgeth a man
according to his works

1614 The sinner shall not escape in his rapines and the patience of
him that sheweth mercy shall not be put off

1615 All mercy shall make a place for every man according to the
merit of his works and according to the wisdom of his sojournment

1616 Say not I shall be hidden from God and who shall remember me
from on high

1617 In such a multitude I shall not be known for what is my soul in
such an immense creation

1618 Behold the heaven and the heavens of heavens the deep and all
the earth and the things that are in them shall be moved in his
sight

1619 The mountains also and the hills and the foundations of the
earth when God shall look upon them they shall be shaken with
trembling

1620 And in all these things the heart is senseless and every heart
is understood by him

1621 And his ways who shall understand and the storm which no eye
of man shall see

1622 For many of his works are hidden but the works of his justice
who shall declare or who shall endure for the testament is far from
some and the examination of all is in the end

1623 He that wanteth understanding thinketh vain things and the
foolish and erring man thinketh foolish things

1624 Hearken to me my son and learn the discipline of
understanding and attend to my words in thy heart

1625 And I will shew forth good doctrine in equity and will seek to
declare wisdom and attend to my words in thy heart whilst with equity
of spirit I tell thee the virtues that God hath put upon his works from
the beginning and I shew forth in truth his knowledge

1626 The works of God are done in judgment from the beginning and
from the making of them he distinguished their parts and their
beginnings in their generations

1627 He beautified their works for ever they have neither hungered
nor laboured and they have not ceased from their works

1628 Nor shall any of them straiten his neighbour at any time

1629 Be not thou incredulous to his word

1630 After this God looked upon the earth and filled it with his
goods

1631 The soul of every living thing hath shewn forth before the face
thereof and into it they return again

Shewn forth  Viz the glory and power of God upon the earth



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 17


The creation and favour of God to man An exhortation to turn to God

171 God created man of the earth and made him after his own image

172 And he turned him into it again and clothed him with strength
according to himself

173 He gave him the number of his days and time and gave him power
over all things that are upon the earth

174 He put the fear of him upon all flesh and he had dominion over
beasts and fowls

175 He created of him a helpmate like to himself he gave them
counsel and a tongue and eyes and ears and a heart to devise and
he filled them with the knowledge of understanding

176 He created in them the science of the spirit he fired their
heart with wisdom and shewed them both good and evil

177 He set his eye upon their hearts to shew them the greatness of
his works

178 That they might praise the name which he hath sanctified and
glory in his wondrous act that they might declare the glorious things
of his works

179 Moreover he gave them instructions and the law of life for an
inheritance

1710 He made an everlasting covenant with them and he shewed them
his justice and judgments

1711 And their eye saw the majesty of his glory and their ears heard
his glorious voice and he said to them Beware of all iniquity

Their eye saw etc  Viz when he gave the law on mount Sinai

1712 And he gave to every one of them commandment concerning his
neighbour

1713 Their ways are always before him they are not hidden from his
eyes

1714 Over every nation he set a ruler

1715 And Israel was made the manifest portion of God

1716 And all their works are as the sun in the sight of God and his
eyes are continually upon their ways

1717 Their covenants were not hid by their iniquity and all their
iniquities are in the sight of God

1718 The alms of a man is as a signet with him and shall preserve
the grace of a man as the apple of the eye

1719 And afterward he shall rise up and shall render them their
reward to every one upon their own head and shall turn them down into
the bowels of the earth

1720 But to the penitent he hath given the way of justice and he
hath strengthened them that were fainting in patience and hath
appointed to them the lot of truth

1721 Turn to the Lord and forsake thy sins

1722 Make thy prayer before the face of the Lord and offend less

Offend less  Minue offendicula That is remove sins and the
occasions of sins

1723 Return to the Lord and turn away from thy injustice and
greatly hate abomination

1724 And know the justices and judgments of God and stand firm in
the lot set before thee and in prayer to the most high God

1725 Go to the side of the holy age with them that live and give
praise to God

Go to the side etc  Fly from the side of Satan and sin and join
with the holy ones that follow God and godliness

1726 Tarry not in the error of the ungodly give glory before death
Praise perisheth from the dead as nothing

1727 Give thanks whilst thou art living whilst thou art alive and in
health thou shalt give thanks and shalt praise God and shalt glory in
his mercies

1728 How great is the mercy of the Lord and his forgiveness to them
that turn to him 

1729 For all things cannot be in men because the son of man is not
immortal and they are delighted with the vanity of evil

1730 What is brighter than the sun yet it shall be eclipsed Or what
is more wicked than that which flesh and blood hath invented and this
shall be reproved

1731 He beholdeth the power of the height of heaven and all men are
earth and ashes



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 18


Gods works are wonderful we must serve him and not our lusts

181 He that liveth for ever created all things together God only
shall be justified and he remaineth an invincible king for ever

182 Who is able to declare his works

183 For who shall search out his glorious acts

184 And who shall show forth the power of his majesty or who shall
be able to declare his mercy

185 Nothing may be taken away nor added neither is it possible to
find out the glorious works of God

186 When a man hath done then shall he begin and when he leaveth
off he shall be at a loss

Then shall he begin  God is so great and incomprehensible that when
man has done all that he can to find out his greatness and boundless
perfections he is still to begin for what he has found out is but a
mere nothing in comparison with his infinity

187 What is man and what is his grace and what is his good or what
is his evil

188 The number of the days of men at the most are a hundred years as
a drop of water of the sea are they esteemed and as a pebble of the
sand so are a few years compared to eternity

189 Therefore God is patient in them and poureth forth his mercy
upon them

1810 He hath seen the presumption of their heart that it is wicked
and hath known their end that it is evil

1811 Therefore hath he filled up his mercy in their favour and hath
shewn them the way of justice

1812 The compassion of man is toward his neighbour but the mercy of
God is upon all flesh

1813 He hath mercy and teacheth and correcteth as a shepherd doth
his flock

1814 He hath mercy on him that receiveth the discipline of mercy and
that maketh haste in his judgments

1815 My son in thy good deeds make no complaint and when thou
givest any thing add not grief by an evil word

1816 Shall not the dew assuage the heat so also the good word is
better than the gift

1817 Lo is not a word better than a gift but both are with a
justified man

1818 A fool will upbraid bitterly and a gift of one ill taught
consumeth the eyes

1819 Before judgment prepare thee justice and learn before thou
speak

1820 Before sickness take a medicine and before judgment examine
thyself and thou shalt find mercy in the sight of God

1821 Humble thyself before thou art sick and in the time of sickness
shew thy conversation

1822 Let nothing hinder thee from praying always and be not afraid
to be justified even to death for the reward of God continueth for
ever

1823 Before prayer prepare thy soul and be not as a man that
tempteth God

1824 Remember the wrath that shall be at the last day and the time
of repaying when he shall turn away his face

1825 Remember poverty in the time of abundance and the necessities
of poverty in the day of riches

1826 From the morning until the evening the time shall be changed
and all these are swift in the eyes of God

1827 A wise man will fear in every thing and in the days of sins
will beware of sloth

1828 Every man of understanding knoweth wisdom and will give praise
to him that findeth her

1829 They that were of good understanding in words have also done
wisely themselves and have understood truth and justice and have
poured forth proverbs and judgments

1830 Go not after thy lusts but turn away from thy own will

1831 If thou give to thy soul her desires she will make thee a joy
to thy enemies

1832 Take no pleasure in riotous assemblies be they ever so small
for their concertation is continual

1833 Make not thyself poor by borrowing to contribute to feasts when
thou hast nothing in thy purse for thou shalt be an enemy to thy own
life



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 19


Admonition against sundry vices

191 A workman that is a drunkard shall not be rich and he that
contemneth small things shall fall by little and little

192 Wine and women make wise men fall off and shall rebuke the
prudent

193 And he that joineth himself to harlots will be wicked
Rottenness and worms shall inherit him and he shall be lifted up for a
greater example and his soul shall be taken away out of the number

194 He that is hasty to give credit is light of heart and shall be
lessened and he that sinneth against his own soul shall be despised

195 He that rejoiceth in iniquity shall be censured and he that
hateth chastisement shall have less life and he that hateth babbling
extinguisheth evil

196 He that sinneth against his own soul shall repent and he that
is delighted with wickedness shall be condemned

197 Rehearse not again a wicked and harsh word and thou shalt not
fare the worse

198 Tell not thy mind to friend or foe and if there be a sin with
thee disclose it not

199 For he will hearken to thee and will watch thee and as it were
defending thy sin he will hate thee and so will he be with thee
always

1910 Hast thou heard a word against thy neighbour let it die within
thee trusting that it will not burst thee

1911 At the hearing of a word the fool is in travail as a woman
groaning in the bringing forth a child

1912 As an arrow that sticketh in a mans thigh so is a word in the
heart of a fool

1913 Reprove a friend lest he may not have understood and say I
did it not or if he did it that he may do it no more

1914 Reprove thy neighbour for it may be he hath not said it and if
he hath said it that he may not say it again

1915 Admonish thy friend for there is often a fault committed

1916 And believe not every word There is one that slippeth with the
tongue but not from his heart

1917 For who is there that hath not offended with his tongue
Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him

1918 And give place to the fear of the most High for the fear of God
is all wisdom and therein is to fear God and the disposition of the
law is in all wisdom

1919 But the learning of wickedness is not wisdom and the device of
sinners is not prudence

1920 There is a subtle wickedness and the same is detestable and
there is a man that is foolish wanting in wisdom

1921 Better is a man that hath less wisdom and wanteth
understanding with the fear of God than he that aboundeth in
understanding and transgresseth the law of the most High

1922 There is an exquisite subtilty and the same is unjust

1923 And there is one that uttereth an exact word telling the truth
There is one that humbleth himself wickedly and his interior is full
of deceit

1924 And there is one that submitteth himself exceedingly with a
great lowliness and there is one that casteth down his countenance
and maketh as if he did not see that which is unknown

1925 And if he be hindered from sinning for want of power if he
shall find opportunity to do evil he will do it

1926 A man is known by his look and a wise man when thou meetest
him is known by his countenance

1927 The attire of the body and the laughter of the teeth and the
gait of the man shew what he is

1928 There is a lying rebuke in the anger of an injurious man and
there is a judgment that is not allowed to be good and there is one
that holdeth his peace he is wise



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 20


Rules with regard to correction discretion and avoiding lies

201 How much better is it to reprove than to be angry and not to
hinder him that confesseth in prayer

202 The lust of an eunuch shall deflour a young maiden

203 So is he that by violence executeth of the unwise

204 How good is it when thou art reproved to shew repentance for
so thou shalt escape wilful sin

205 There is one that holdeth his peace that is found wise and
there is another that is hateful that is bold in speech

206 There is one that holdeth his peace because he knoweth not what
to say and there is another that holdeth his peace knowing the proper
time

207 A wise man will hold his peace till he see opportunity but a
babbler and a fool will regard no time

208 He that useth many words shall hurt his own soul and he that
taketh authority to himself unjustly shall be hated

209 There is success in evil things to a man without discipline and
there is a finding that turneth to loss

2010 There is a gift that is not profitable and there is a gift the
recompense of which is double

2011 There is an abasement because of glory and there is one that
shall lift up his head from a low estate

2012 There is that buyeth much for a small price and restoreth the
same sevenfold

2013 A man wise in words shall make himself beloved but the graces
of fools shall be poured out

2014 The gift of the fool shall do thee no good for his eyes are
sevenfold

2015 He will give a few things and upbraid much and the opening of
his mouth is the kindling of a fire

2016 To day a man lendeth and to morrow he asketh it again such a
man as this is hateful

2017 A fool shall have no friend and there shall be no thanks for
his good deeds

2018 For they that eat his bread are of a false tongue How often
and how many will laugh him to scorn

2019 For he doth not distribute with right understanding that which
was to be had in like manner also that which was not to be had

2020 The slipping of a false tongue is as one that falleth on the
pavement so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily

2021 A man without grace is as a vain fable it shall be continually
in the mouth of the unwise

2022 A parable coming out of a fools mouth shall be rejected for he
doth not speak it in due season

2023 There is that is hindered from sinning through want and in his
rest he shall be pricked

2024 There is that will destroy his own soul through shamefacedness
and by occasion of an unwise person he will destroy it and by respect
of person he will destroy himself

2025 There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend and
maketh him his enemy for nothing

2026 A lie is a foul blot in a man and yet it will be continually in
the mouth of men without discipline

2027 A thief is better than a man that is always lying but both of
them shall inherit destruction

2028 The manners of lying men are without honour and their confusion
is with them without ceasing

2029 A wise man shall advance himself with his words and a prudent
man shall please the great ones

2030 He that tilleth his land shall make a high heap of corn and he
that worketh justice shall be exalted and he that pleaseth great men
shall escape iniquity

2031 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of judges and make them dumb
in the mouth so that they cannot correct

2032 O Wisdom that is hid and treasure that is not seen what profit
is there in them both

2033 Better is he that hideth his folly than the man that hideth his
wisdom



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 21


Cautions against sin in general and some sins in particular

211 My son hast thou sinned do so no more but for thy former sins
also pray that they may be forgiven thee

212 Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent for if thou comest
near them they will take hold of thee

213 The teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion killing the souls of
men

214 All iniquity is like a twoedged sword there is no remedy for
the wound thereof

215 Injuries and wrongs will waste riches and the house that is very
rich shall be brought to nothing by pride so the substance of the
proud shall be rooted out

216 The prayer out of the mouth of the poor shall reach the ears of
God and judgment shall come for him speedily

217 He that hateth to be reproved walketh in the trace of a sinner
and he that feareth God will turn to his own heart

218 He that is mighty by a bold tongue is known afar off but a wise
man knoweth to slip by him

219 He that buildeth his house at other mens charges is as he that
gathereth himself stones to build in the winter

2110 The congregation of sinners is like tow heaped together and the
end of them is a flame of fire

2111 The way of sinners is made plain with stones and in their end
is hell and darkness and pains

2112 He that keepeth justice shall get the understanding thereof

2113 The perfection of the fear of God is wisdom and understanding

2114 He that is not wise in good will not be taught

2115 But there is a wisdom that aboundeth in evil and there is no
understanding where there is bitterness

2116 The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood and his
counsel continueth like a fountain of life

2117 The heart of a fool is like a broken vessel and no wisdom at
all shall it hold

2118 A man of sense will praise every wise word he shall hear and
will apply it to himself the luxurious man hath heard it and it shall
displease him and he will cast it behind his back

2119 The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way but in the
lips of the wise grace shall be found

2120 The mouth of the prudent is sought after in the church and they
will think upon his words in their hearts

2121 As a house that is destroyed so is wisdom to a fool and the
knowledge of the unwise is as words without sense

2122 Doctrine to a fool is as fetters on the feet and like manacles
on the right hand

2123 A fool lifteth up his voice in laughter but a wise man will
scarce laugh low to himself

2124 Learning to the prudent is as an ornament of gold and like a
bracelet upon his right arm

2125 The foot of a fool is soon in his neighbours house but a man
of experience will be abashed at the person of the mighty

2126 A fool will peep through the window into the house but he that
is well taught will stand without

2127 It is the folly of a man to hearken at the door and a wise man
will be grieved with the disgrace

2128 The lips of the unwise will be telling foolish things but the
words of the wise shall be weighed in a balance

2129 The heart of fools is in their mouth and the mouth of wise men
is in their heart

2130 While the ungodly curseth the devil he curseth his own soul

While the ungodly etc  He condemneth and curseth himself inasmuch
as by sin he takes part with the devil and is as it were his member
and subject

2131 The talebearer shall defile his own soul and shall be hated by
all and he that shall abide with him shall be hateful the silent and
wise man shall be honoured



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 22


Wise sayings on divers subjects

221 The sluggard is pelted with a dirty stone and all men will speak
of his disgrace

222 The sluggard is pelted with the dung of oxen and every one that
toucheth him will shake his hands

223 A son ill taught is the confusion of the father and a foolish
daughter shall be to his loss

224 A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband but
she that confoundeth becometh a disgrace to her father

225 She that is bold shameth both her father and husband and will
not be inferior to the ungodly and shall be disgraced by them both

226 A tale out of time is like music in mourning but the stripes and
instruction of wisdom are never out of time

227 He that teacheth a fool is like one that glueth a potsherd
together

228 He that telleth a word to him that heareth not is like one that
waketh a man out of a deep sleep

229 He speaketh with one that is asleep who uttereth wisdom to a
fool and in the end of the discourse he saith Who is this

2210 Weep for the dead for his light hath failed and weep for the
fool for his understanding faileth

For the fool  In the language of the Holy Ghost he is styled a fool
that turns away from God to follow vanity and sin And what is said by
the wise man against fools is meant of such fools as these

2211 Weep but a little for the dead for he is at rest

2212 For the wicked life of a wicked fool is worse than death

2213 The mourning for the dead is seven days but for a fool and an
ungodly man all the days of their life

2214 Talk not much with a fool and go not with him that hath no
sense

2215 Keep thyself from him that thou mayst not have trouble and
thou shalt not be defiled with his sin

2216 Turn away from him and thou shalt find rest and shalt not be
wearied out with his folly

2217 What is heavier than lead and what other name hath he but fool

2218 Sand and salt and a mass of iron is easier to bear than a man
without sense that is both foolish and wicked

2219 A frame of wood bound together in the foundation of a building
shall not be loosed so neither shall the heart that is established by
advised counsel

2220 The thought of him that is wise at all times shall not be
depraved by fear

2221 As pales set in high places and plasterings made without cost
will not stand against the face of the wind

2222 So also a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool shall not
resist against the violence of fear

2223 As a fearful heart in the thought of a fool at all times will
not fear so neither shall he that continueth always in the
commandments of God

2224 He that pricketh the eye bringeth out tears and he that
pricketh the heart bringeth forth resentment

2225 He that flingeth a stone at birds shall drive them away so he
that upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship

2226 Although thou hast drawn a sword at a friend despair not for
there may be a returning To a friend

2227 If thou hast opened a sad mouth fear not for there may be a
reconciliation except upbraiding and reproach and pride and
disclosing of secrets or a treacherous wound for in all these cases a
friend will flee away

2228 Keep fidelity with a friend in his poverty that in his
prosperity also thou mayst rejoice

2229 In the time of his trouble continue faithful to him that thou
mayst also be heir with him in his inheritance

2230 As the vapour of a chimney and the smoke of the fire goeth up
before the fire so also injurious words and reproaches and threats
before blood

2231 I will not be ashamed to salute a friend neither will I hide
myself from his face and if any evil happen to me by him I will bear
it

2232 But every one that shall hear it will beware of him

2233 Who will set a guard before my mouth and a sure seal upon my
lips that I fall not by them and that my tongue destroy me not



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 23


A prayer for grace to flee sin cautions against profane swearing and
other vices

231 O Lord father and sovereign ruler of my life leave me not to
their counsel nor suffer me to fall by them

By them  Viz the tongue and the lips mentioned in the last verse
of the foregoing chapter

232 Who will set scourges over my thoughts and the discipline of
wisdom over my heart that they spare me not in their ignorances and
that their sins may not appear

That they spare me not in their ignorances etc  That is that the
scourges and discipline of wisdom may restrain the ignorances that is
the slips and offences which are usually committed by the tongue and
the lips

233 Lest my ignorances increase and my offences be multiplied and
my sins abound and I fall before my adversaries and my enemy rejoice
over me

234 O Lord father and God of my life leave me not to their
devices

235 Give me not haughtiness of my eyes and turn away from me all
coveting

236 Take from me the greediness of the belly and let not the lusts
of the flesh take hold of me and give me not over to a shameless and
foolish mind

237 Hear O ye children the discipline of the mouth and he that
will keep it shall not perish by his lips nor be brought to fall into
most wicked works

238 A sinner is caught in his own vanity and the proud and the evil
speakers shall fall thereby

239 Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing for in it there are
many falls

2310 And let not the naming of God be usual in thy mouth and meddle
not with the names of saints for thou shalt not escape free from them

2311 For as a slave daily put to the question is never without a
blue mark so every one that sweareth and nameth shall not be wholly
pure from sin

2312 A man that sweareth much shall be filled with iniquity and a
scourge shall not depart from his house

2313 And if he make it void his sin shall be upon him and if he
dissemble it he offendeth double

2314 And if he swear in vain he shall not be justified for his
house shall be filled with his punishment

2315 There is also another speech opposite to death let it not be
found in the inheritance of Jacob

2316 For from the merciful all these things shall be taken away and
they shall not wallow in sins

2317 Let not thy mouth be accustomed to indiscreet speech for
therein is the word of sin

2318 Remember thy father and thy mother for thou sittest in the
midst of great men

2319 Lest God forget thee in their sight and thou by thy daily
custom be infatuated and suffer reproach and wish that thou hadst not
been born and curse the day of thy nativity

2320 The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words will never be
corrected all the days of his life

2321 Two sorts of men multiply sins and the third bringeth wrath and
destruction

2322 A hot soul is a burning fire it will never be quenched till it
devour some thing

2323 And a man that is wicked in the mouth of his flesh will not
leave off till he hath kindled a fire

2324 To a man that is a fornicator all bread is sweet he will not be
weary of sinning unto the end

2325 Every man that passeth beyond his own bed despising his own
soul and saying Who seeth me

2326 Darkness compasseth me about and the walls cover me and no man
seeth me whom do I fear the most High will not remember my sins

2327 And he understandeth not that his eye seeth all things for such
a mans fear driveth him from the fear of God and the eyes of men
fearing him

2328 And he knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are far brighter
than the sun beholding round about all the ways of men and the bottom
of the deep and looking into the hearts of men into the most hidden
parts

2329 For all things were known to the Lord God before they were
created so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things

2330 This man shall be punished in the streets of the city and he
shall be chased as a colt and where he suspected not he shall be
taken

2331 And he shall be in disgrace with all men because he understood
not the fear of the Lord

2332 So every woman also that leaveth her husband and bringeth in an
heir by another

2333 For first she hath been unfaithful to the law of the most High
and secondly she hath offended against her husband thirdly she hath
fornicated in adultery and hath gotten her children of another man

2334 This woman shall be brought into the assembly and inquisition
shall be made of her children

2335 Her children shall not take root and her branches shall bring
forth no fruit

2336 She shall leave her memory to be cursed and her infamy shall
not be blotted out

2337 And they that remain shall know that there is nothing better
than the fear of God and that there is nothing sweeter than to have
regard to the commandments of the Lord

2338 It is great glory to follow the Lord for length of days shall
be received from him



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 24


Wisdom praiseth herself her origin her dwelling her dignity and her
fruits

241 Wisdom shall praise her own self and shall be honoured in God
and shall glory in the midst of her people

242 And shall open her mouth in the churches of the most High and
shall glorify herself in the sight of his power

243 And in the midst of her own people she shall be exalted and
shall be admired in the holy assembly

244 And in the multitude of the elect she shall have praise and
among the blessed she shall be blessed saying

245 I came out of the mouth of the most High the firstborn before
all creatures

246 I made that in the heavens there should rise light that never
faileth and as a cloud I covered all the earth

247 I dwelt in the highest places and my throne is in a pillar of a
cloud

248 I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven and have penetrated
into the bottom of the deep and have walked in the waves of the sea

249 And have stood in all the earth and in every people

2410 And in every nation I have had the chief rule

2411 And by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts of all
the high and low and in all these I sought rest and I shall abide in
the inheritance of the Lord

2412 Then the creator of all things commanded and said to me and he
that made me rested in my tabernacle

2413 And he said to me Let thy dwelling be in Jacob and thy
inheritance in Israel and take root in my elect

2414 From the beginning and before the world was I created and
unto the world to come I shall not cease to be and in the holy
dwelling place I have ministered before him

2415 And so was I established in Sion and in the holy city likewise
I rested and my power was in Jerusalem

2416 And I took root in an honourable people and in the portion of
my God his inheritance and my abode is in the full assembly of saints

2417 I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus and as a cypress tree on
mount Sion

2418 I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades and as a rose plant in
Jericho

2419 As a fair olive tree in the plains and as a plane tree by the
water in the streets was I exalted

2420 I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aromatical balm I
yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh

2421 And I perfumed my dwelling as storax and galbanum and onyx
and aloes and as the frankincense not cut and my odour is as the
purest balm

2422 I have stretched out my branches as the turpentine tree and my
branches are of honour and grace

2423 As the vine I have brought forth a pleasant odour and my
flowers are the fruit of honour and riches

2424 I am the mother of fair love and of fear and of knowledge and
of holy hope

2425 In me is all grace of the way and of the truth in me is all
hope of life and of virtue

2426 Come over to me all ye that desire me and be filled with my
fruits

2427 For my spirit is sweet above honey and my inheritance above
honey and the honeycomb

2428 My memory is unto everlasting generations

2429 They that eat me shall yet hunger and they that drink me
shall yet thirst

2430 He that hearkeneth to me shall not be confounded and they that
work by me shall not sin

2431 They that explain me shall have life everlasting

2432 All these things are the book of life and the covenant of the
most High and the knowledge of truth

2433 Moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices and an
inheritance to the house of Jacob and the promises to Israel

2434 He appointed to David his servant to raise up of him a most
mighty king and sitting on the throne of glory for ever

A most mighty king  Viz Christ who by his gospel like an
overflowing river has enriched the earth with heavenly wisdom

2435 Who filleth up wisdom as the Phison and as the Tigris in the
days of the new fruits

2436 Who maketh understanding to abound as the Euphrates who
multiplieth it as the Jordan in the time of harvest

2437 Who sendeth knowledge as the light and riseth up as Gehon in
the time of the vintage

2438 Who first hath perfect knowledge of her and a weaker shall not
search her out

Who first hath perfect knowledge of her  Christ was the first that
had perfect knowledge of heavenly wisdom

2439 For her thoughts are more vast than the sea and her counsels
more deep than the great ocean

2440 I wisdom have poured out rivers

2441 I like a brook out of a river of a mighty water I like a
channel of a river and like an aqueduct came out of paradise

2442 I said I will water my garden of plants and I will water
abundantly the fruits of my meadow

2443 And behold my brook became a great river and my river came near
to a sea

2444 For I make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning light
and I will declare it afar off

2445 I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth and will
behold all that sleep and will enlighten all that hope in the Lord

2446 I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy and will leave it to
them that seek wisdom and will not cease to instruct their offspring
even to the holy age

2447 See ye that I have not laboured myself only but for all that
seek out the truth



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 25


Documents of wisdom on several subjects

251 With three things my spirit is pleased which are approved before
God and men

252 The concord of brethren and the love of neighbours and man and
wife that agree well together

253 Three sorts my soul hateth and I am greatly grieved at their
life

254 A poor man that is proud a rich man that is a liar an old man
that is a fool and doting

255 The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth how shalt
thou find them in thy old age

256 O how comely is judgment for a grey head and for ancients to
know counsel

257 O how comely is wisdom for the aged and understanding and
counsel to men of honour

258 Much experience is the crown of old men and the fear of God is
their glory

259 Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I
magnified and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue

2510 A man that hath joy of his children and he that liveth and
seeth the fall of his enemies

2511 Blessed is he that dwelleth with a wise woman and that hath not
slipped with his tongue and that hath not served such as are unworthy
of him

2512 Blessed is he that findeth a true friend and that declareth
justice to an ear that heareth

2513 How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge but there is
none above him that feareth the Lord

2514 The fear of God hath set itself above all things

2515 Blessed is the man to whom it is given to have the fear of God
he that holdeth it to whom shall he be likened

2516 The fear of God is the beginning of his love and the beginning
of faith is to be fast joined unto it

2517 The sadness of the heart is every plague and the wickedness of
a woman is all evil

2518 And a man will choose any plague but the plague of the heart

2519 And any wickedness but the wickedness of a woman

2520 And any affliction but the affliction from them that hate him

2521 And any revenge but the revenge of enemies

2522 There is no head worse than the head of a serpent

2523 And there is no anger above the anger of a woman It will be
more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon than to dwell with a
wicked woman

2524 The wickedness of a woman changeth her face and she darkeneth
her countenance as a bear and sheweth it like sackcloth In the midst
of her neighbours

2525 Her husband groaned and hearing he sighed a little

2526 All malice is short to the malice of a woman let the lot of
sinners fall upon her

2527 As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged so is
a wife full of tongue to a quiet man

2528 Look not upon a womans beauty and desire not a woman for
beauty

2529 A womans anger and impudence and confusion is great

2530 A woman if she have superiority is contrary to her husband

2531 A wicked woman abateth the courage and maketh a heavy
countenance and a wounded heart

2532 Feeble hands and disjointed knees a woman that doth not make
her husband happy

2533 From the woman came the beginning of sin and by her we all die

2534 Give no issue to thy water no not a little nor to a wicked
woman liberty to gad abroad

2535 If she walk not at thy hand she will confound thee in the sight
of thy enemies

2536 Cut her off from thy flesh lest she always abuse thee



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 26


Of good and bad women

261 Happy is the husband of a good wife for the number of his years
is double

262 A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband and shall fulfil the
years of his life in peace

263 A good wife is a good portion she shall be given in the portion
of them that fear God to a man for his good deeds

264 Rich or poor if his heart is good his countenance shall be
cheerful at all times

265 Of three things my heart hath been afraid and at the fourth my
face hath trembled

266 The accusation of a city and the gathering together of the
people

267 And a false calumny all are more grievous than death

268 A jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the heart

269 With a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue which
communicateth with all

2610 As a yoke of oxen that is moved to and fro so also is a wicked
woman he that hath hold of her is as he that taketh hold of a
scorpion

2611 A drunken woman is a great wrath and her reproach and shame
shall not be hid

2612 The fornication of a woman shall be known by the haughtiness of
her eyes and by her eyelids

2613 On a daughter that turneth not away herself set a strict watch
lest finding an opportunity she abuse herself

2614 Take heed of the impudence of her eyes and wonder not if she
slight thee

2615 She will open her mouth as a thirsty traveller to the fountain
and will drink of every water near her and will sit down by every
hedge and open her quiver against every arrow until she fail

2616 The grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband and
shall fat his bones

2617 Her discipline is the gift of God

2618 Such is a wise and silent woman and there is nothing so much
worth as a well instructed soul

2619 A holy and shamefaced woman is grace upon grace

2620 And no price is worthy of a continent soul

2621 As the sun when it riseth to the world in the high places of
God so is the beauty of a good wife for the ornament of her house

2622 As the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick so is the beauty
of the face in a ripe age

2623 As golden pillars upon bases of silver so are the firm feet
upon the soles of a steady woman

2624 As everlasting foundations upon a solid rock so the
commandments of God in the heart of a holy woman

2625 At two things my heart is grieved and the third bringeth anger
upon me

2626 A man of war fainting through poverty and a man of sense
despised

2627 And he that passeth over from justice to sin God hath prepared
such an one for the sword

2628 Two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and dangerous a
merchant is hardly free from negligence and a huckster shall not be
justified from the sins of the lips

From negligence  That is from the neglect of the service of God
because the eager pursuit of the mammon of this world is apt to make
men of that calling forget the great duties of loving God above all
things and their neighbours as themselvesIbid A huckster  Or a
retailer of wine Men of that profession are both greatly exposed to
danger of sin themselves and are too often accessary to the sins of
others



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 27


Dangers of sin from several heads the fear of God is the best
preservative He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it

271 Through poverty many have sinned and he that seeketh to be
enriched turneth away his eye

272 As a stake sticketh fast in the midst of the joining of stones
so also in the midst of selling and buying sin shall stick fast

273 Sin shall be destroyed with the sinner

274 Unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the Lord thy
house shall quickly be overthrown

275 As when one sifteth with a sieve the dust will remain so will
the perplexity of a man in his thoughts

276 The furnace trieth the potters vessels and the trial of
affliction just men

277 As the dressing of a tree sheweth the fruit thereof so a word
out of the thought of the heart of man

278 Praise not a man before he speaketh for this is the trial of
men

279 If thou followest justice thou shalt obtain her and shalt put
her on as a long robe of honour and thou shalt dwell with her and she
shall protect thee for ever and in the day of acknowledgment thou
shalt find a strong foundation

2710 Birds resort unto their like so truth will return to them that
practise her

2711 The lion always lieth in wait for prey so do sins for them that
work iniquities

2712 A holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun but a fool is
changed as the moon

2713 In the midst of the unwise keep in the word till its time but
be continually among men that think

2714 The discourse of sinners is hateful and their laughter is at
the pleasures of sin

2715 The speech that sweareth much shall make the hair of the head
stand upright and its irreverence shall make one stop his ears

2716 In the quarrels of the road is the shedding of blood and their
cursing is a grievous hearing

2717 He that discloseth the secret of a friend loseth his credit and
shall never find a friend to his mind

2718 Love thy neighbour and be joined to him with fidelity

2719 But if thou discover his secrets follow no more after him

2720 For as a man that destroyeth his friend so is he that
destroyeth the friendship of his neighbour

2721 And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand so hast thou
let thy neighbour go and thou shalt not get him again

2722 Follow after him no more for he is gone afar off he is fled
as a roe escaped out of the snare because his soul is wounded

2723 Thou canst no more bind him up And of a curse there is
reconciliation

And of a curse there is reconciliation  That is it is easier to
obtain a reconciliation after a curse than after disclosing a secret

2724 But to disclose the secrets of a friend leaveth no hope to an
unhappy soul

2725 He that winketh with the eye forgeth wicked things and no man
will cast him off

2726 In the sight of thy eyes he will sweeten his mouth and will
admire thy words but at the last he will writhe his mouth and on thy
words he will lay a stumblingblock

2727 I have hated many things but not like him and the Lord will
hate him

2728 If one cast a stone on high it will fall upon his own head and
the deceitful stroke will wound the deceitful

2729 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and he that setteth a
stone for his neighbour shall stumble upon it and he that layeth a
snare for another shall perish in it

2730 A mischievous counsel shall be rolled back upon the author and
he shall not know from whence it cometh to him

2731 Mockery and reproach are of the proud and vengeance as a lion
shall lie in wait for him

2732 They shall perish in a snare that are delighted with the fall of
the just and sorrow shall consume them before they die

2733 Anger and fury are both of them abominable and the sinful man
shall be subject to them



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 28


Lessons against revenge and quarrels The evils of the tongue

281 He that seeketh to revenge himself shall find vengeance from the
Lord and he will surely keep his sins in remembrance

282 Forgive thy neighbour if he hath hurt thee and then shall thy
sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest

283 Man to man reserveth anger and doth he seek remedy of God

284 He hath no mercy on a man like himself and doth he entreat for
his own sins

285 He that is but flesh nourisheth anger and doth he ask
forgiveness of God who shall obtain pardon for his sins

286 Remember thy last things and let enmity cease

287 For corruption and death hang over in his commandments

In his commandments  Supply the sentence out of the Greek thus
Remember corruption and death and abide in the commandments

288 Remember the fear of God and be not angry with thy neighbour

289 Remember the covenant of the most High and overlook the
ignorance of thy neighbour

2810 Refrain from strife and thou shalt diminish thy sins

2811 For a passionate man kindleth strife and a sinful man will
trouble his friends and bring in debate in the midst of them that are
at peace

2812 For as the wood of the forest is so the fire burneth and as a
mans strength is so shall his anger be and according to his riches
he shall increase his anger

2813 A hasty contention kindleth a fire and a hasty quarrel sheddeth
blood and a tongue that beareth witness bringeth death

2814 If thou blow the spark it shall burn as a fire and if thou
spit upon it it shall be quenched both come out of the mouth

2815 The whisperer and the double tongue is accursed for he hath
troubled many that were at peace

2816 The tongue of a third person hath disquieted many and scattered
them from nation to nation

2817 It hath destroyed the strong cities of the rich and hath
overthrown the houses of great men

2818 It hath cut in pieces the forces of people and undone strong
nations

2819 The tongue of a third person hath cast out valiant women and
deprived them of their labours

2820 He that hearkeneth to it shall never have rest neither shall
he have a friend in whom he may repose

2821 The stroke of a whip maketh a blue mark but the stroke of the
tongue will break the bones

2822 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword but not so many as
have perished by their own tongue

2823 Blessed is he that is defended from a wicked tongue that hath
not passed into the wrath thereof and that hath not drawn the yoke
thereof and hath not been bound in its bands

2824 For its yoke is a yoke of iron and its bands are bands of
brass

2825 The death thereof is a most evil death and hell is preferable
to it

2826 Its continuance shall not be for a long time but it shall
possess the ways of the unjust and the just shall not be burnt with
its flame

2827 They that forsake God shall fall into it and it shall burn in
them and shall not be quenched and it shall be sent upon them as a
lion and as a leopard it shall tear them

2828 Hedge in thy ears with thorns hear not a wicked tongue and
make doors and bars to thy mouth

2829 Melt down thy gold and silver and make a balance for thy words
and a just bridle for thy mouth

2830 And take heed lest thou slip with thy tongue and fall in the
sight of thy enemies who lie in wait for thee and thy fall be
incurable unto death



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 29


Of charity in lending money and justice in repaying Of alms and of
being surety

291 He that sheweth mercy lendeth to his neighbour and he that is
stronger in hand keepeth the commandments

And he that is stronger in hand  That is he that is hearty and
bountiful in lending to his neighbour in his necessity

292 Lend to thy neighbour in the time of his need and pay thou thy
neighbour again in due time

293 Keep thy word and deal faithfully with him and thou shalt
always find that which is necessary for thee

294 Many have looked upon a thing lent as a thing found and have
given trouble to them that helped them

295 Till they receive they kiss the hands of the lender and in
promises they humble their voice

296 But when they should repay they will ask time and will return
tedious and murmuring words and will complain of the time

297 And if he be able to pay he will stand off he will scarce pay
one half and will count it as if he had found it

298 But if not he will defraud him of his money and he shall get
him for an enemy without cause

299 And he will pay him with reproaches and curses and instead of
honour and good turn will repay him injuries

2910 Many have refused to lend not out of wickedness but they were
afraid to be defrauded without cause

2911 But yet towards the poor be thou more hearty and delay not to
shew him mercy

2912 Help the poor because of the commandment and send him not away
empty handed because of his poverty

2913 Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend and hide it not
under a stone to be lost

2914 Place thy treasure in the commandments of the most High and it
shall bring thee more profit than gold

2915 Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall obtain help
for thee against all evil

2916 Better than the shield of the mighty and better than the spear

2917 It shall fight for thee against thy enemy

2918 A good man is surety for his neighbour and he that hath lost
shame will leave him to himself

2919 Forget not the kindness of thy surety for he hath given his
life for thee

2920 The sinner and the unclean fleeth from his surety

2921 A sinner attributeth to himself the goods of his surety and he
that is of an unthankful mind will leave him that delivered him

2922 A man is surety for his neighbour and when he hath lost all
shame he shall forsake him

2923 Evil suretyship hath undone many of good estate and hath tossed
them as a wave of the sea

2924 It hath made powerful men to go from place to place round about
and they have wandered in strange countries

2925 A sinner that transgresseth the commandment of the Lord shall
fall into an evil suretyship and he that undertaketh many things
shall fall into judgment

2926 Recover thy neighbour according to thy power and take heed to
thyself that thou fall not

2927 The chief thing for mans life is water and bread and clothing
and a house to cover shame

2928 Better is the poor mans fare under a roof of boards than
sumptuous cheer abroad in another mans house

2929 Be contented with little instead of much and thou shalt not
hear the reproach of going abroad

2930 It is a miserable life to go as a guest from house to house for
where a man is a stranger he shall not deal confidently nor open his
mouth

2931 He shall entertain and feed and give drink to the unthankful
and moreover he shall hear bitter words

2932 Go stranger and furnish the table and give others to eat what
thou hast in thy hand

2933 Give place to the honourable presence of my friends for I want
my house my brother being to be lodged with me

2934 These things are grievous to a man of understanding the
upbraiding of houseroom and the reproaching of the lender



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 30


Of correction of children Health is better than wealth Excessive
grief is hurtful

301 He that loveth his son frequently chastiseth him that he may
rejoice in his latter end and not grope after the doors of his
neighbours

302 He that instructeth his son shall be praised in him and shall
glory in him in the midst of them of his household

303 He that teacheth his son maketh his enemy jealous and in the
midst of his friends he shall glory in him

304 His father is dead and he is as if he were not dead for he hath
left one behind him that is like himself

305 While he lived he saw and rejoiced in him and when he died he
was not sorrowful neither was he confounded before his enemies

306 For he left behind him a defender of his house against his
enemies and one that will requite kindness to his friends

307 For the souls of his sons he shall bind up his wounds and at
every cry his bowels shall be troubled

308 A horse not broken becometh stubborn and a child left to himself
will become headstrong

309 Give thy son his way and he shall make thee afraid play with
him and he shall make thee sorrowful

3010 Laugh not with him lest thou have sorrow and at the last thy
teeth be set on edge

3011 Give him not liberty in his youth and wink not at his devices

3012 Bow down his neck while he is young and beat his sides while he
is a child lest he grow stubborn and regard thee not and so be a
sorrow of heart to thee

3013 Instruct thy son and labour about him lest his lewd behaviour
be an offence to thee

3014 Better is a poor man who is sound and strong of constitution
than a rich man who is weak and afflicted with evils

3015 Health of the soul in holiness of justice is better than all
gold and silver and a sound body than immense revenues

3016 There is no riches above the riches of the health of the body
and there is no pleasure above the joy of the heart

3017 Better is death than a bitter life and everlasting rest than
continual sickness

3018 Good things that are hidden in a mouth that is shut are as
messes of meat set about a grave

3019 What good shall an offering do to an idol for it can neither
eat nor smell

3020 So is he that is persecuted by the Lord bearing the reward of
his iniquity

3021 He seeth with his eyes and groaneth as an eunuch embracing a
virgin and sighing

3022 Give not up thy soul to sadness and afflict not thyself in thy
own counsel

3023 The joyfulness of the heart is the life of a man and a never
failing treasure of holiness and the joy of a man is length of life

3024 Have pity on thy own soul pleasing God and contain thyself
gather up thy heart in his holiness and drive away sadness far from
thee

3025 For sadness hath killed many and there is no profit in it

3026 Envy and anger shorten a mans days and pensiveness will bring
old age before the time

3027 A cheerful and good heart is always feasting for his banquets
are prepared with diligence



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 31


Of the desire of riches and of moderation in eating and drinking

311 Watching for riches consumeth the flesh and the thought thereof
driveth away sleep

312 The thinking beforehand turneth away the understanding and a
grievous sickness maketh the soul sober

313 The rich man hath laboured in gathering riches together and when
he resteth he shall be filled with his goods

314 The poor man hath laboured in his low way of life and in the end
he is still poor

315 He that loveth gold shall not be justified and he that
followeth after corruption shall be filled with it

316 Many have been brought to fall for gold and the beauty thereof
hath been their ruin

317 Gold is a stumblingblock to them that sacrifice to it woe to
them that eagerly follow after it and every fool shall perish by it

318 Blessed is the rich man that is found without blemish and that
hath not gone after gold nor put his trust in money nor in treasures

319 Who is he and we will praise him for he hath done wonderful
things in his life

3110 Who hath been tried thereby and made perfect he shall have
glory everlasting He that could have transgressed and hath not
transgressed and could do evil things and hath not done them

3111 Therefore are his goods established in the Lord and all the
church of the saints shall declare his alms

3112 Art thou set at a great table be not the first to open thy
mouth upon it

3113 Say not There are many things which are upon it

3114 Remember that a wicked eye is evil

3115 What is created more wicked than an eye therefore shall it weep
over all the face when it shall see

3116 Stretch not out thy hand first lest being disgraced with envy
thou be put to confusion

3117 Be not hasty in a feast

3118 Judge of the disposition of thy neighbour by thyself

3119 Use as a frugal man the things that are set before thee lest if
thou eatest much thou be hated

3120 Leave off first for manners sake and exceed not lest thou
offend

3121 And if thou sittest among many reach not thy hand out first of
all and be not the first to ask for drink

3122 How sufficient is a little wine for a man well taught and in
sleeping thou shalt not be uneasy with it and thou shalt feel no pain

3123 Watching and choler and gripes are with an intemperate man

3124 Sound and wholesome sleep with a moderate man he shall sleep
till morning and his soul shall be delighted with him

3125 And if thou hast been forced to eat much arise go out and
vomit and it shall refresh thee and thou shalt not bring sickness
upon thy body

3126 Hear me my son and despise me not and in the end thou shalt
find my words

3127 In all thy works be quick and no infirmity shall come to thee

3128 The lips of many shall bless him that is liberal of his bread
and the testimony of his truth is faithful

3129 Against him that is niggardly of his bread the city will
murmur and the testimony of his niggardliness is true

3130 Challenge not them that love wine for wine hath destroyed very
many

3131 Fire trieth hard iron so wine drunk to excess shall rebuke the
hearts of the proud

3132 Wine taken with sobriety is equal life to men if thou drink it
moderately thou shalt be sober

3133 What is his life who is diminished with wine

3134 What taketh away life death

3135 Wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful and not
to make them drunk

3136 Wine drunken with moderation is the joy of the soul and the
heart

3137 Sober drinking is health to soul and body

3138 Wine drunken with excess raiseth quarrels and wrath and many
ruins

3139 Wine drunken with excess is bitterness of the soul

3140 The heat of drunkenness is the stumblingblock of the fool
lessening strength and causing wounds

3141 Rebuke not thy neighbour in a banquet of wine and despise him
not in his mirth

3142 Speak not to him words of reproach and press him not in
demanding again



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 32


Lessons for superiors and inferiors Advantages of fearing God and
doing nothing without counsel

321 Have they made thee ruler be not lifted up be among them as one
of them

322 Have care of them and so sit down and when thou hast acquitted
thyself of all thy charge take thy place

323 That thou mayst rejoice for them and receive a crown as an
ornament of grace and get the honour of the contribution

324 Speak thou that art elder for it becometh thee

325 To speak the first word with careful knowledge and hinder not
music

326 Where there is no hearing pour not out words and be not lifted
up out of season with thy wisdom

327 A concert of music in a banquet of wine is as a carbuncle set in
gold

328 As a signet of an emerald in a work of gold so is the melody of
music with pleasant and moderate wine

329 Hear in silence and for thy reverence good grace shall come to
thee

3210 Young man scarcely speak in thy own cause

3211 If thou be asked twice let thy answer be short

3212 In many things be as if thou wert ignorant and hear in silence
and withal seeking

3213 In the company of great men take not upon thee and when the
ancients are present speak not much

3214 Before a storm goeth lightning and before shamefacedness goeth
favour and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee

3215 And at the time of rising be not slack but be first to run home
to thy house and there withdraw thyself and there take thy pastime

3216 And do what thou hast a mind but not in sin or proud speech

3217 And for all these things bless the Lord that made thee and
that replenisheth thee with all his good things

3218 He that feareth the Lord will receive his discipline and they
that will seek him early shall find a blessing

3219 He that seeketh the law shall be filled with it and he that
dealeth deceitfully shall meet with a stumblingblock therein

3220 They that fear the Lord shall find just judgment and shall
kindle justice as a light

3221 A sinful man will flee reproof and will find an excuse
according to his will

3222 A man of counsel will not neglect understanding a strange and
proud man will not dread fear

3223 Even after he hath done with fear without counsel he shall be
controlled by the things of his own seeking

3224 My son do thou nothing without counsel and thou shalt not
repent when thou hast done

3225 Go not in the way of ruin and thou shalt not stumble against
the stones trust not thyself to a rugged way lest thou set a
stumblingblock to thy soul

3226 And beware of thy own children and take heed of them of thy
household

3227 In every work of thine regard thy soul in faith for this is the
keeping of the commandments

In faith  That is follow sincerely thy soul in her faith and
conscience

3228 He that believeth God taketh heed to the commandments and he
that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 33


The fear of God is the best security Times and men are in the hands of
God Take care of thyself as long as thou livest and look to thy
servants

331 No evils shall happen to him that feareth the Lord but in
temptation God will keep him and deliver him from evils

332 A wise man hateth not the commandments and justices and he shall
not be dashed in pieces as a ship in a storm

333 A man of understanding is faithful to the law of God and the law
is faithful to him

334 He that cleareth up a question shall prepare what to say and so
having prayed he shall be heard and shall keep discipline and then he
shall answer

335 The heart of a fool is as a wheel of a cart and his thoughts are
like a rolling axletree

336 A friend that is a mocker is like a stallion horse he neigheth
under every one that sitteth upon him

337 Why doth one day excel another and one light another and one
year another year when all come of the sun

338 By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished the sun
being made and keeping his commandment

339 And he ordered the seasons and holidays of them and in them
they celebrated festivals at an hour

3310 Some of them God made high and great days and some of them he
put in the number of ordinary days And all men are from the ground
and out of the earth from whence Adam was created

3311 With much knowledge the Lord hath divided them and diversified
their ways

3312 Some of them hath he blessed and exalted and some of them hath
he sanctified and set near himself and some of them hath he cursed
and brought low and turned them from their station

3313 As the potters clay is in his hand to fashion and order it

3314 All his ways are according to his ordering so man is in the
hand of him that made him and he will render to him according to his
judgment

3315 Good is set against evil and life against death so also is the
sinner against a just man And so look upon all the works of the most
High Two and two and one against another

3316 And I awaked last of all and as one that gathereth after the
grapegatherers

3317 In the blessing of God I also have hoped and as one that
gathereth grapes have I filled the winepress

3318 See that I have not laboured for myself only but for all that
seek discipline

3319 Hear me ye great men and all ye people and hearken with your
ears ye rulers of the church

3320 Give not to son or wife brother or friend power over thee
while thou livest and give not thy estate to another lest thou
repent and thou entreat for the same

3321 As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee let no man
change thee

Change thee  That is so as to have this power over thee

3322 For it is better that thy children should ask of thee than that
thou look toward the hands of thy children

3323 In all thy works keep the preeminence

The preeminence  That is be master in thy own house and part not
with thy authority

3324 Let no stain sully thy glory In the time when thou shalt end
the days of thy life and in the time of thy decease distribute thy
inheritance

3325 Fodder and a wand and a burden are for an ass bread and
correction and work for a slave

3326 He worketh under correction and seeketh to rest let his hands
be idle and he seeketh liberty

3327 The yoke and the thong bend a stiff neck and continual labours
bow a slave

3328 Torture and fetters are for a malicious slave send him to work
that he be not idle

3329 For idleness hath taught much evil

3330 Set him to work for so it is fit for him And if he be not
obedient bring him down with fetters but be not excessive towards any
one and do no grievous thing without judgment

3331 If thou have a faithful servant let him be to thee as thy own
soul treat him as a brother because in the blood of thy soul thou
hast gotten him

3332 If thou hurt him unjustly he will run away

3333 And if he rise up and depart thou knowest not whom to ask and
in what way to seek him



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 34


The vanity of dreams The advantage of experience and of the fear of
God

341 The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and
deceitful and dreams lift up fools

342 The man that giveth heed to lying visions is like to him that
catcheth at a shadow and followeth after the wind

343 The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another
as when a mans likeness is before the face of a man

344 What can be made clean by the unclean and what truth can come
from that which is false

345 Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of
evildoers are vanity

346 And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail except it
be a vision sent forth from the most High set not thy heart upon them

347 For dreams have deceived many and they have failed that put
their trust in them

348 The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie and wisdom
shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful

349 What doth he know that hath not been tried A man that hath much
experience shall think of many things and he that hath learned many
things shall shew forth understanding

3410 He that hath no experience knoweth little and he that hath
been experienced in many things multiplieth prudence

3411 He that hath not been tried what manner of things doth he know
he that hath been surprised shall abound with subtlety

3412 I have seen many things by travelling and many customs of
things

3413 Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things and I
have been delivered by the grace of God

3414 The spirit of those that fear God is sought after and by his
regard shall be blessed

3415 For their hope is on him that saveth them and the eyes of God
are upon them that love him

3416 He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing and shall not
be afraid for he is his hope

3417 The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed

3418 To whom doth he look and who is his strength

3419 The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him he is their
powerful protector and strong stay a defence from the heat and a
cover from the sun at noon

3420 A preservation from stumbling and a help from falling he
raiseth up the soul and enlighteneth the eyes and giveth health and
life and blessing

3421 The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully
gotten is stained and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable

3422 The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth
and justice

3423 The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked neither
hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust nor will he be pacified
for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices

3424 He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor is as one
that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father

3425 The bread of the needy is the life of the poor he that
defraudeth them thereof is a man of blood

3426 He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat is like him that
killeth his neighbour

3427 He that sheddeth blood and he that defraudeth the laborer of
his hire are brothers

3428 When one buildeth up and another pulleth down what profit have
they but the labour

3429 When one prayeth and another curseth whose voice will God
hear

3430 He that washeth himself after touching the dead if he toucheth
him again what doth his washing avail

3431 So a man that fasteth for his sins and doth the same again
what doth his humbling himself profit him who will hear his prayer



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 35


What sacrifices are pleasing to God

351 He that keepeth the law multiplieth offerings

352 It is a wholesome sacrifice to take heed to the commandments and
to depart from all iniquity

353 And to depart from injustice is to offer a propitiatory
sacrifice for injustices and a begging of pardon for sins

354 He shall return thanks that offereth fine flour and he that
doth mercy offereth sacrifice

355 To depart from iniquity is that which pleaseth the Lord and to
depart from injustice is an entreaty for sins

356 Thou shalt not appear empty in the sight of the Lord

357 For all these things are to be done because of the commandment of
God

358 The oblation of the just maketh the altar fat and is an odour of
sweetness in the sight of the most High

359 The sacrifice of the just is acceptable and the Lord will not
forget the memorial thereof

3510 Give glory to God with a good heart and diminish not the
firstfruits of thy hands

3511 In every gift shew a cheerful countenance and sanctify thy
tithes with joy

3512 Give to the most High according to what he hath given to thee
and with a good eye do according to the ability of thy hands

3513 For the Lord maketh recompense and will give thee seven times
as much

3514 Do not offer wicked gifts for such he will not receive

3515 And look not upon an unjust sacrifice for the Lord is judge
and there is not with him respect of person

3516 The Lord will not accept any person against a poor man and he
will hear the prayer of him that is wronged

3517 He will not despise the prayers of the fatherless nor the
widow when she poureth out her complaint

3518 Do not the widows tears run down the cheek and her cry against
him that causeth them to fall

3519 For from the cheek they go up even to heaven and the Lord that
heareth will not be delighted with them

3520 He that adoreth God with joy shall be accepted and his prayer
shall approach even to the clouds

3521 The prayer of him that humbleth himself shall pierce the
clouds and till it come nigh he will not be comforted and he will not
depart till the most High behold

3522 And the Lord will not be slack but will judge for the just and
will do judgment and the Almighty will not have patience with them
that he may crush their back

3523 And he will repay vengeance to the Gentiles till he have taken
away the multitude of the proud and broken the sceptres of the unjust

3524 Till he have rendered to men according to their deeds and
according to the works of Adam and according to his presumption

3525 Till he have judged the cause of his people and he shall
delight the just with his mercy

3526 The mercy of God is beautiful in the time of affliction as a
cloud of rain in the time of drought



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 36


A prayer for the church of God Of a good heart and a good wife

361 Have mercy upon us O God of all and behold us and shew us the
light of thy mercies

362 And send thy fear upon the nations that have not sought after
thee that they may know that there is no God beside thee and that
they may shew forth thy wonders

363 Lift up thy hand over the strange nations that they may see thy
power

364 For as thou hast been sanctified in us in their sight so thou
shalt be magnified among them in our presence

365 That they may know thee as we also have known thee that there
is no God beside thee O Lord

366 Renew thy signs and work new miracles

367 Glorify thy hand and thy right arm

368 Raise up indignation and pour out wrath

369 Take away the adversary and crush the enemy

3610 Hasten the time and remember the end that they may declare thy
wonderful works

3611 Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire and
let them perish that oppress thy people

3612 Crush the head of the princes of the enemies that say There is
no other beside us

3613 Gather together all the tribes of Jacob that they may know that
there no God besides thee and may declare thy great works and thou
shalt inherit them as from the beginning

3614 Have mercy on thy people upon whom thy name is invoked and
upon Israel whom thou hast raised up to be thy firstborn

3615 Have mercy on Jerusalem the city which thou hast sanctified
the city of thy rest

3616 Fill Sion with thy unspeakable words and thy people with thy
glory

3617 Give testimony to them that are thy creatures from the
beginning and raise up the prophecies which the former prophets spoke
in thy name

3618 Reward them that patiently wait for thee that thy prophets may
be found faithful and hear the prayers of thy servants

3619 According to the blessing of Aaron over thy people and direct
us into the way of justice and let all know that dwell upon the earth
that thou art God the beholder of all ages

3620 The belly will devour all meat yet one is better than another

3621 The palate tasteth venison and the wise heart false speeches

3622 A perverse heart will cause grief and a man of experience will
resist it

3623 A woman will receive every man yet one daughter is better than
another

A woman will receive every man  That is any man that her parents
propose to her to marry though she does not like him but marries in
obedience to her parents who make the choice for her

3624 The beauty of a woman cheereth the countenance of her husband
and a man desireth nothing more

3625 If she have a tongue that can cure and likewise mitigate and
shew mercy her husband is not like other men

3626 He that possesseth a good wife beginneth a possession she is a
help like to himself and a pillar of rest

3627 Where there is no hedge the possession shall be spoiled and
where there is no wife he mourneth that is in want

3628 Who will trust him that hath no rest and that lodgeth
wheresoever the night taketh him as a robber well appointed that
skippeth from city to city



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 37


Of the choice of friends and counsellors

371 Every friend will say I also am his friend but there is a
friend that is only a friend in name Is not this a grief even to
death

372 But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy

373 O wicked presumption whence camest thou to cover the earth with
thy malice and deceitfulness

374 There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys
but in the time of trouble he will be against him

375 There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his
bellys sake and he will take up a shield against the enemy

376 Forget not thy friend in thy mind and be not unmindful of him in
thy riches

377 Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee and hide thy
counsel from them that envy thee

378 Every counsellor giveth out counsel but there is one that is a
counsellor for himself

379 Beware of a counsellor And know before what need he hath for he
will devise to his own mind

3710 Lest he thrust a stake into the ground and say to thee

3711 Thy way is good and then stand on the other side to see what
shall befall thee

3712 Treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness nor
with an unjust man concerning justice nor with a woman touching her of
whom she is jealous nor with a coward concerning war nor with a
merchant about traffic nor with a buyer of selling nor with an
envious man of giving thanks

3713 Nor with the ungodly of piety nor with the dishonest of
honesty nor with the field laborer of every work

3714 Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the
year nor with an idle servant of much business give no heed to these
in any matter of counsel

3715 But be continually with a holy man whomsoever thou shalt know
to observe the fear of God

3716 Whose soul is according to thy own soul and who when thou
shalt stumble in the dark will be sorry for thee

3717 And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel for there
is no other thing of more worth to thee than it

3718 The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things more
than seven watchmen that sit in a high place to watch

3719 But above all these things pray to the most High that he may
direct thy way in truth

3720 In all thy works let the true word go before thee and steady
counsel before every action

3721 A wicked word shall change the heart out of which four manner
of things arise good and evil life and death and the tongue is
continually the ruler of them There is a man that is subtle and a
teacher of many and yet is unprofitable to his own soul

3722 A skilful man hath taught many and is sweet to his own soul

3723 He that speaketh sophistically is hateful he shall be
destitute of every thing

3724 Grace is not given him from the Lord for he is deprived of all
wisdom

3725 There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul and the fruit
of his understanding is commendable

3726 A wise man instructeth his own people and the fruits of his
understanding are faithful

3727 A wise man shall be filled with blessings and they that see
shall praise him

3728 The life of a man is in the number of his days but the days of
Israel are innumerable

3729 A wise man shall inherit honour among his people and his name
shall live for ever

3730 My son prove thy soul in thy life and if it be wicked give it
no power

3731 For all things are not expedient for all and every kind
pleaseth not every soul

3732 Be not greedy in any feasting and pour not out thyself upon any
meat

3733 For in many meats there will be sickness and greediness will
turn to choler

3734 By surfeiting many have perished but he that is temperate
shall prolong life



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 38


Of physicians and medicines what is to be done in sickness and how we
are to mourn for the dead Of the employments of labourers and
artificers

381 Honour the physician for the need thou hast of him for the most
High hath created him

382 For all healing is from God and he shall receive gifts of the
king

383 The skill of the physician shall lift up his head and in the
sight of great men he shall be praised

384 The most High hath created medicines out of the earth and a wise
man will not abhor them

385 Was not bitter water made sweet with wood

386 The virtue of these things is come to the knowledge of men and
the most High hath given knowledge to men that he may be honoured in
his wonders

387 By these he shall cure and shall allay their pains and of these
the apothecary shall make sweet confections and shall make up
ointments of health and of his works there shall be no end

388 For the peace of God is over all the face of the earth

389 My son in thy sickness neglect not thyself but pray to the
Lord and he shall heal thee

3810 Turn away from sin and order thy hands aright and cleanse thy
heart from all offence

3811 Give a sweet savour and a memorial of fine flour and make a
fat offering and then give place to the physician

3812 For the Lord created him and let him not depart from thee for
his works are necessary

3813 For there is a time when thou must fall into their hands

3814 And they shall beseech the Lord that he would prosper what they
give for ease and remedy for their conversation

3815 He that sinneth in the sight of his Maker shall fall into the
hands of the physician

3816 My son shed tears over the dead and begin to lament as if thou
hadst suffered some great harm and according to judgment cover his
body and neglect not his burial

3817 And for fear of being ill spoken of weep bitterly for a day and
then comfort thyself in thy sadness

3818 And make mourning for him according to his merit for a day or
two for fear of detraction

3819 For of sadness cometh death and it overwhelmeth the strength
and the sorrow of the heart boweth down the neck

3820 In withdrawing aside sorrow remaineth and the substance of the
poor is according to his heart

3821 Give not up thy heart to sadness but drive it from thee and
remember the latter end

3822 Forget it not for there is no returning and thou shalt do him
no good and shalt hurt thyself

3823 Remember my judgment for thine also shall be so yesterday for
me and to day for thee

3824 When the dead is at rest let his remembrance rest and comfort
him in the departing of his spirit

3825 The wisdom of a scribe cometh by his time of leisure and he
that is less in action shall receive wisdom

A scribe  That is a doctor of the law or a learned man

3826 With what wisdom shall he be furnished that holdeth the plough
and that glorieth in the goad that driveth the oxen therewith and is
occupied in their labours and his whole talk is about the offspring of
bulls

3827 He shall give his mind to turn up furrows and his care is to
give the kine fodder

3828 So every craftsman and workmaster that laboureth night and day
he who maketh graven seals and by his continual diligence varieth the
figure he shall give his mind to the resemblance of the picture and
by his watching shall finish the work

3829 So doth the smith sitting by the anvil and considering the iron
work The vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh and he fighteth with
the heat of the furnace

3830 The noise of the hammer is always in his ears and his eye is
upon the pattern of the vessel he maketh

3831 He setteth his mind to finish his work and his watching to
polish them to perfection

3832 So doth the potter sitting at his work turning the wheel about
with his feet who is always carefully set to his work and maketh all
his work by number

3833 He fashioneth the clay with his arm and boweth down his
strength before his feet

3834 He shall give his mind to finish the glazing and his watching
to make clean the furnace

3835 All these trust to their hands and every one is wise in his own
art

3836 Without these a city is not built

3837 And they shall not dwell nor walk about therein and they shall
not go up into the assembly

3838 Upon the judges seat they shall not sit and the ordinance of
judgment they shall not understand neither shall they declare
discipline and judgment and they shall not be found where parables are
spoken

3839 But they shall strengthen the state of the world and their
prayer shall be in the work of their craft applying their soul and
searching in the law of the most High



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 39


The exercises of the wise man The Lord is to be glorified for his
works

391 The wise man will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients and
will be occupied in the prophets

392 He will keep the sayings of renowned men and will enter withal
into the subtilties of parables

393 He will search out the hidden meanings of proverbs and will be
conversant in the secrets of parables

394 He shall serve among great men and appear before the governor

395 He shall pass into strange countries for he shall try good and
evil among men

396 He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him
and he will pray in the sight of the most High

397 He will open his mouth in prayer and will make supplication for
his sins

398 For if it shall please the great Lord he will fill him with the
spirit of understanding

399 And he will pour forth the words of his wisdom as showers and in
his prayer he will confess to the Lord

3910 And he shall direct his counsel and his knowledge and in his
secrets shall he meditate

3911 He shall shew forth the discipline he hath learned and shall
glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord

3912 Many shall praise his wisdom and it shall never be forgotten

3913 The memory of him shall not depart away and his name shall be
in request from generation to generation

3914 Nations shall declare his wisdom and the church shall shew
forth his praise

3915 If he continue he shall leave a name above a thousand and if
he rest it shall be to his advantage

3916 I will yet meditate that I may declare for I am filled as with
a holy transport

3917 By a voice he saith Hear me ye divine offspring and bud forth
as the rose planted by the brooks of waters

Ye divine offspring  He speaks to the children of Israel the people
of God whom he exhorts to bud forth and flourish with virtue

3918 Give ye a sweet odour as frankincense

3919 Send forth flowers as the lily and yield a smell and bring
forth leaves in grace and praise with canticles and bless the Lord in
his works

3920 Magnify his name and give glory to him with the voice of your
lips and with the canticles of your mouths and with harps and in
praising him you shall say in this manner

3921 All the works of the Lord are exceeding good

3922 At his word the waters stood as a heap and at the words of his
mouth the receptacles of waters

3923 For at his commandment favour is shewn and there is no
diminishing of his salvation

3924 The works of all flesh are before him and there is nothing hid
from his eyes

3925 He seeth from eternity to eternity and there is nothing
wonderful before him

3926 There is no saying What is this or what is that for all
things shall be sought in their time

3927 His blessing hath overflowed like a river

3928 And as a flood hath watered the earth so shall his wrath
inherit the nations that have not sought after him

3929 Even as he turned the waters into a dry land and the earth was
made dry and his ways were made plain for their journey so to sinners
they are stumblingblocks in his wrath

3930 Good things were created for the good from the beginning so for
the wicked good and evil things

3931 The principal things necessary for the life of men are water
fire and iron salt milk and bread of flour and honey and the
cluster of the grape and oil and clothing

3932 All these things shall be for good to the holy so to the
sinners and the ungodly they shall be turned into evil

3933 There are spirits that are created for vengeance and in their
fury they lay on grievous torments

3934 In the time of destruction they shall pour out their force and
they shall appease the wrath of him that made them

3935 Fire hail famine and death all these were created for
vengeance

3936 The teeth of beasts and scorpions and serpents and the sword
taking vengeance upon the ungodly unto destruction

3937 In his commandments they shall feast and they shall be ready
upon earth when need is and when their time is come they shall not
transgress his word

3938 Therefore from the beginning I was resolved and I have
meditated and thought on these things and left them in writing

3939 All the works of the Lord are good and he will furnish every
work in due time

3940 It is not to be said This is worse than that for all shall be
well approved in their time

3941 Now therefore with the whole heart and mouth praise ye him and
bless the name of the Lord



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 40


The miseries of the life of man are relieved by the grace of God and
his fear

401 Great labour is created for all men and a heavy yoke is upon the
children of Adam from the day of their coming out of their mothers
womb until the day of their burial into the mother of all

402 Their thoughts and fears of the heart their imagination of
things to come and the day of their end

403 From him that sitteth on a glorious throne unto him that is
humbled in earth and ashes

404 From him that weareth purple and beareth the crown even to him
that is covered with rough linen wrath envy trouble unquietness
and the fear of death continual anger and strife

405 And in the time of rest upon his bed the sleep of the night
changeth his knowledge

406 A little and as nothing is his rest and afterward in sleep as
in the day of keeping watch

407 He is troubled in the vision of his heart as if he had escaped
in the day of battle In the time of his safety he rose up and
wondereth that there is no fear

408 Such things happen to all flesh from man even to beast and upon
sinners are sevenfold more

409 Moreover death and bloodshed strife and sword oppressions
famine and affliction and scourges

4010 All these things are created for the wicked and for their sakes
came the flood

4011 All things that are of the earth shall return to the earth
again and all waters shall return to the sea

4012 All bribery and injustice shall be blotted out and fidelity
shall stand for ever

4013 The riches of the unjust shall be dried up like a river and
shall pass away with a noise like a great thunder in rain

4014 While he openeth his hands he shall rejoice but transgressors
shall pine away in the end

4015 The offspring of the ungodly shall not bring forth many
branches and make a noise as unclean roots upon the top of a rock

4016 The weed growing over every water and at the bank of the river
shall be pulled up before all grass

4017 Grace is like a paradise in blessings and mercy remaineth for
ever

4018 The life of a laborer that is content with what he hath shall
be sweet and in it thou shalt find a treasure

4019 Children and the building of a city shall establish a name but
a blameless wife shall be counted above them both

4020 Wine and music rejoice the heart but the love of wisdom is
above them both

4021 The flute and the psaltery make a sweet melody but a pleasant
tongue is above them both

4022 Thy eye desireth favour and beauty but more than these green
sown fields

4023 A friend and companion meeting together in season but above
them both is a wife with her husband

4024 Brethren are a help in the time of trouble but mercy shall
deliver more than they

4025 Gold and silver make the feet stand sure but wise counsel is
above them both

4026 Riches and strength lift up the heart but above these is the
fear of the Lord

4027 There is no want in the fear of the Lord and it needeth not to
seek for help

4028 The fear of the Lord is like a paradise of blessing and they
have covered it above all glory

4029 My son in thy lifetime be not indigent for it is better to die
than to want

4030 The life of him that looketh toward another mans table is not
to be counted a life for he feedeth his soul with another mans meat

4031 But a man well instructed and taught will look to himself

4032 Begging will be sweet in the mouth of the unwise but in his
belly there shall burn a fire



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 41


Of the remembrance of death of an evil and of a good name of what
things we ought to be ashamed

411 O death how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath
peace in his possessions

412 To a man that is at rest and whose ways are prosperous in all
things and that is yet able to take meat

413 O death thy sentence is welcome to the man that is in need and
to him whose strength faileth

414 Who is in a decrepit age and that is in care about all things
and to the distrustful that loseth patience

415 Fear not the sentence of death Remember what things have been
before thee and what shall come after thee this sentence is from the
Lord upon all flesh

416 And what shall come upon thee by the good pleasure of the most
High whether ten or a hundred or a thousand years

417 For among the dead there is no accusing of life

418 The children of sinners become children of abominations and they
that converse near the houses of the ungodly

419 The inheritance of the children of sinners shall perish and with
their posterity shall be a perpetual reproach

4110 The children will complain of an ungodly father because for his
sake they are in reproach

4111 Woe to you ungodly men who have forsaken the law of the most
high Lord

4112 And if you be born you shall be born in malediction and if you
die in malediction shall be your portion

4113 All things that are of the earth shall return into the earth
so the ungodly shall from malediction to destruction

4114 The mourning of men is about their body but the name of the
ungodly shall be blotted out

4115 Take care of a good name for this shall continue with thee
more than a thousand treasures precious and great

4116 A good life hath its number of days but a good name shall
continue for ever

4117 My children keep discipline in peace for wisdom that is hid
and a treasure that is not seen what profit is there in them both

4118 Better is the man that hideth his folly than the man that
hideth his wisdom

4119 Wherefore have a shame of these things I am now going to speak
of

Have a shame etc  That is to say be ashamed of doing any of these
things which I am now going to mention for though sometimes
shamefacedness is not to be indulged yet it is often good and
necessary as in the following cases

4120 For it is not good to keep all shamefacedness and all things do
not please all men in opinion

4121 Be ashamed of fornication before father and mother and of a lie
before a governor and a man in power

4122 Of an offence before a prince and a judge of iniquity before a
congregation and a people

4123 Of injustice before a companion and friend and in regard to the
place where thou dwellest

4124 Of theft and of the truth of God and the covenant of leaning
with thy elbow over meat and of deceit in giving and taking

4125 Of silence before them that salute thee of looking upon a
harlot and of turning away thy face from thy kinsman

4126 Turn not away thy face from thy neighbour and of taking away a
portion and not restoring

4127 Gaze not upon another mans wife and be not inquisitive after
his handmaid and approach not her bed

4128 Be ashamed of upbraiding speeches before friends and after thou
hast given upbraid not



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 42


Of what things we ought not to be ashamed Cautions with regard to
women The works and greatness of God

421 Repeat not the word which thou hast heard and disclose not the
thing that is secret so shalt thou be truly without confusion and
shalt find favour before all men be not ashamed of any of these
things and accept no person to sin thereby

422 Of the law of the most High and of his covenant and of judgment
to justify the ungodly

423 Of the affair of companions and travellers and of the gift of
the inheritance of friends

424 Of exactness of balance and weights of getting much or little

425 Of the corruption of buying and of merchants and of much
correction of children and to make the side of a wicked slave to
bleed

426 Sure keeping is good over a wicked wife

427 Where there are many hands shut up and deliver all things in
number and weight and put all in writing that thou givest out or
receivest in

428 Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish and the aged
that are judged by young men and thou shalt be well instructed in all
things and well approved in the sight of all men living

429 The father waketh for the daughter when no man knoweth and the
care for her taketh away his sleep when she is young lest she pass
away the flower of her age and when she is married lest she should be
hateful

4210 In her virginity lest she should be corrupted and be found
with child in her fathers house and having a husband lest she should
misbehave herself or at the least become barren

4211 Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter lest at anytime she
make thee become a laughingstock to thy enemies and a byword in the
city and a reproach among the people and she make thee ashamed before
all the multitude

4212 Behold not everybodys beauty and tarry not among women

4213 For from garments cometh a moth and from a woman the iniquity
of a man

4214 For better is the iniquity of a man than a woman doing a good
turn and a woman bringing shame and reproach

Better is the iniquity etc  That is there is commonly speaking
less danger to be apprehended to the soul from the churlishness or
injuries we receive from men than from the flattering favours and
familiarity of women

4215 I will now remember the works of the Lord and I will declare
the things I have seen By the words of the Lord are his works

4216 The sun giving light hath looked upon all things and full of
the glory of the Lord is his work

4217 Hath not the Lord made the saints to declare all his wonderful
works which the Lord Almighty hath firmly settled to be established
for his glory

4218 He hath searched out the deep and the heart of men and
considered their crafty devices

4219 For the Lord knoweth all knowledge and hath beheld the signs of
the world he declareth the things that are past and the things that
are to come and revealeth the traces of hidden things

4220 No thought escapeth him and no word can hide itself from him

4221 He hath beautified the glorious works of his wisdom and he is
from eternity to eternity and to him nothing may be added

4222 Nor can he be diminished and he hath no need of any counsellor

4223 O how desirable are all his works and what we can know is but
as a spark

4224 All these things live and remain for ever and for every use
all things obey him

4225 All things are double one against another and he hath made
nothing defective

4226 He hath established the good things of every one And who shall
be filled with beholding his glory



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 43


The works of God are exceedingly glorious and wonderful no man is able
sufficiently to praise him

431 The firmament on high is his beauty the beauty of heaven with
its glorious shew

432 The sun when he appeareth shewing forth at his rising an
admirable instrument the work of the most High

433 At noon he burneth the earth and who can abide his burning heat
As one keeping a furnace in the works of heat

434 The sun three times as much burneth the mountains breathing out
fiery vapours and shining with his beams he blindeth the eyes

435 Great is the Lord that made him and at his words he hath
hastened his course

436 And the moon in all in her season is for a declaration of times
and a sign of the world

437 From the moon is the sign of the festival day a light that
decreaseth in her perfection

438 The month is called after her name increasing wonderfully in her
perfection

439 Being an instrument of the armies on high shining gloriously in
the firmament of heaven

4310 The glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven the Lord
enlighteneth the world on high

4311 By the words of the holy one they stand in judgment and shall
never fall in their watches

4312 Look upon the rainbow and bless him that made it it is very
beautiful in its brightness

4313 It encompasseth the heaven about with the circle of its glory
the hands of the most High have displayed it

4314 By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall apace and sendeth
forth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment

4315 Through this are the treasures opened and the clouds fly out
like birds

4316 By his greatness he hath fixed the clouds and the hailstones
are broken

4317 At his sight shall the mountains be shaken and at his will the
south wind shall blow

4318 The noise of his thunder shall strike the earth so doth the
northern storm and the whirlwind

4319 And as the birds lighting upon the earth he scattereth snow
and the falling thereof is as the coming down of locusts

4320 The eye admireth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof and the
heart is astonished at the shower thereof

4321 He shall pour frost as salt upon the earth and when it
freezeth it shall become like the tops of thistles

4322 The cold north wind bloweth and the water is congealed into
crystal upon every gathering together of waters it shall rest and
shall clothe the waters as a breastplate

4323 And it shall devour the mountains and burn the wilderness and
consume all that is green as with fire

4324 A present remedy of all is the speedy coming of a cloud and a
dew that meeteth it by the heat that cometh shall overpower it

4325 At his word the wind is still and with his thought he appeaseth
the deep and the Lord hath planted islands therein

4326 Let them that sail on the sea tell the dangers thereof and
when we hear with our ears we shall admire

4327 There are great and wonderful works a variety of beasts and of
all living things and the monstrous creatures of whales

4328 Through him is established the end of their journey and by his
word all things are regulated

4329 We shall say much and yet shall want words but the sum of our
words is He is all

4330 What shall we be able to do to glorify him for the Almighty
himself is above all his works

4331 The Lord is terrible and exceeding great and his power is
admirable

4332 Glorify the Lord as much as ever you can for he will yet far
exceed and his magnificence is wonderful

4333 Blessing the Lord exalt him as much as you can for he is above
all praise

4334 When you exalt him put forth all your strength and be not
weary for you can never go far enough

4335 Who shall see him and declare him and who shall magnify him as
he is from the beginning

4336 There are many things hidden from us that are greater than
these for we have seen but a few of his works

4337 But the Lord hath made all things and to the godly he hath
given wisdom



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 44


The praises of the holy fathers in particular of Enoch Noe Abraham
Isaac and Jacob

441 Let us now praise men of renown and our fathers in their
generation

442 The Lord hath wrought great glory through his magnificence from
the beginning

443 Such as have borne rule in their dominions men of great power
and endued with their wisdom shewing forth in the prophets the dignity
of prophets

444 And ruling over the present people and by the strength of wisdom
instructing the people in most holy words

445 Such as by their skill sought out musical tunes and published
canticles of the scriptures

446 Rich men in virtue studying beautifulness living at peace in
their houses

447 All these have gained glory in their generations and were
praised in their days

448 They that were born of them have left a name behind them that
their praises might be related

449 And there are some of whom there is no memorial who are
perished as if they had never been and are become as if they had
never been born and their children with them

4410 But these were men of mercy whose godly deeds have not failed

4411 Good things continue with their seed

4412 Their posterity are a holy inheritance and their seed hath
stood in the covenants

4413 And their children for their sakes remain for ever their seed
and their glory shall not be forsaken

4414 Their bodies are buried in peace and their name liveth unto
generation and generation

4415 Let the people shew forth their wisdom and the church declare
their praise

4416 Henoch pleased God and was translated into paradise that he
may give repentance to the nations

4417 Noe was found perfect just and in the time of wrath he was
made a reconciliation

4418 Therefore was there a remnant left to the earth when the flood
came

4419 The covenants of the world were made with him that all flesh
should no more be destroyed with the flood

4420 Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations and
there was not found the like to him in glory who kept the law of the
most High and was in covenant with him

4421 In his flesh he established the covenant and in temptation he
was found faithful

4422 Therefore by an oath he gave him glory in his posterity that he
should increase as the dust of the earth

4423 And that he would exalt his seed as the stars and they should
inherit from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth

4424 And he did in like manner with Isaac for the sake of Abraham his
father

4425 The Lord gave him the blessing of all nations and confirmed his
covenant upon the head of Jacob

4426 He acknowledged him in his blessings and gave him an
inheritance and divided him his portion in twelve tribes

4427 And he preserved for him men of mercy that found grace in the
eyes of all flesh



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 45


The praises of Moses of Aaron and of Phinees

451 Moses was beloved of God and men whose memory is in
benediction

452 He made him like the saints in glory and magnified him in the
fear of his enemies and with his words he made prodigies to cease

453 He glorified him in the sight of kings and gave him commandments
in the sight of his people and shewed him his glory

454 He sanctified him in his faith and meekness and chose him out
of all flesh

455 For he heard him and his voice and brought him into a cloud

456 And he gave him commandments before his face and a law of life
and instruction that he might teach Jacob his covenant and Israel his
judgments

457 He exalted Aaron his brother and like to himself of the tribe of
Levi

458 He made an everlasting covenant with him and gave him the
priesthood of the nation and made him blessed in glory

459 And he girded him about with a glorious girdle and clothed him
with a robe of glory and crowned him with majestic attire

4510 He put upon him a garment to the feet and breeches and an
ephod and he compassed him with many little bells of gold all round
about

4511 That as he went there might be a sound and a noise made that
might be heard in the temple for a memorial to the children of his
people

4512 He gave him a holy robe of gold and blue and purple a woven
work of a wise man endued with judgment and truth

4513 Of twisted scarlet the work of an artist with precious stones
cut and set in gold and graven by the work of a lapidary for a
memorial according to the number of the tribes of Israel

4514 And a crown of gold upon his mitre wherein was engraved
Holiness an ornament of honour a work of power and delightful to the
eyes for its beauty

4515 Before him there were none so beautiful even from the
beginning

4516 No stranger was ever clothed with them but only his children
alone and his grandchildren for ever

4517 His sacrifices were consumed with fire every day

4518 Moses filled his hands and anointed him with holy oil

4519 This was made to him for an everlasting testament and to his
seed as the days of heaven to execute the office of the priesthood
and to have praise and to glorify his people in his name

4520 He chose him out of all men living to offer sacrifice to God
incense and a good savour for a memorial to make reconciliation for
his people

4521 And he gave him power in his commandments in the covenants of
his judgments that he should teach Jacob his testimonies and give
light to Israel in his law

4522 And strangers stood up against him and through envy the men
that were with Dathan and Abiron compassed him about in the
wilderness and the congregation of Core in their wrath

4523 The Lord God saw and it pleased him not and they were consumed
in his wrathful indignation

4524 He wrought wonders upon them and consumed them with a flame of
fire

4525 And he added glory to Aaron and gave him an inheritance and
divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase of the earth

4526 He prepared them bread in the first place unto fulness for the
sacrifices also of the Lord they shall eat which he gave to him and
to his seed

4527 But he shall not inherit among the people in the land and he
hath no portion among the people for he himself is his portion and
inheritance

4528 Phinees the son of Eleazar is the third in glory by imitating
him in the fear of the Lord

4529 And he stood up in the shameful fall of the people in the
goodness and readiness of his soul he appeased God for Israel

4530 Therefore he made to him a covenant of peace to be the prince
of the sanctuary and of his people that the dignity of priesthood
should be to him and to his seed for ever

4531 And a covenant to David the king the son of Jesse of the tribe
of Juda an inheritance to him and to his seed that he might give
wisdom into our heart to judge his people in justice that their good
things might not be abolished and he made their glory in their nation
everlasting



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 46


The praise of Josue of Caleb and of Samuel

461 Valiant in war was Jesus the son of Nave who was successor of
Moses among the prophets who was great according to his name

Jesus the son of Nave  So Josue is named in the Greek Bibles For
Josue and Jesus signify the same thing viz a saviour

462 Very great for the saving the elect of God to overthrow the
enemies that rose up against them that he might get the inheritance
for Israel

463 How great glory did he gain when he lifted up his hands and
stretched out swords against the cities

464 Who before him hath so resisted for the Lord himself brought the
enemies

465 Was not the sun stopped in his anger and one day made as two

466 He called upon the most high Sovereign when the enemies assaulted
him on every side and the great and holy God heard him by hailstones
of exceeding great force

467 He made a violent assault against the nation of his enemies and
in the descent he destroyed the adversaries

And in the descent  Of Bethhoron Jos 10

468 That the nations might know his power that it is not easy to
fight against God And he followed the mighty one

469 And in the days of Moses he did a work of mercy he and Caleb the
son of Jephone in standing against the enemy and withholding the
people from sins and appeasing the wicked murmuring

4610 And they two being appointed were delivered out of the danger
from among the number of six hundred thousand men on foot to bring
them into their inheritance into the land that floweth with milk and
honey

4611 And the Lord gave strength also to Caleb and his strength
continued even to his old age so that he went up to the high places of
the land and his seed obtained it for an inheritance

4612 That all the children of Israel might see that it is good to
obey the holy God

4613 Then all the judges every one by name whose heart was not
corrupted who turned not away from the Lord

4614 That their memory might be blessed and their bones spring up
out of their place

4615 And their name continue for ever the glory of the holy men
remaining unto their children

4616 Samuel the prophet of the Lord the beloved of the Lord his God
established a new government and anointed princes over his people

4617 By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation and the God
of Jacob beheld and by his fidelity he was proved a prophet

4618 And he was known to be faithful in his words because he saw the
God of light

4619 And called upon the name of the Lord Almighty in fighting
against the enemies who beset him on every side when he offered a lamb
without blemish

4620 And the Lord thundered from heaven and with a great noise made
his voice to be heard

4621 And he crushed the princes of the Tyrians and all the lords of
the Philistines

4622 And before the time of the end of his life in the world he
protested before the Lord and his anointed money or any thing else
even to a shoe he had not taken of any man and no man did accuse him

4623 And after this he slept and he made known to the king and
shewed him the end of his life and he lifted up his voice from the
earth in prophecy to blot out the wickedness of the nation



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 47


The praise of Nathan of David and of Solomon Of his fall and
punishment

471 Then Nathan the prophet arose in the days of David

472 And as the fat taken away from the flesh so was David chosen
from among the children of Israel

473 He played with lions as with lambs and with bears he did in like
manner as with the lambs of the flock in his youth

474 Did not he kill the giant and take away reproach from his
people

475 In lifting up his hand with the stone in the sling he beat down
the boasting of Goliath

476 For he called upon the Lord the Almighty and he gave strength in
his right hand to take away the mighty warrior and to set up the horn
of his nation

477 So in ten thousand did he glorify him and praised him in the
blessings of the Lord in offering to him a crown of glory

478 For he destroyed the enemies on every side and extirpated the
Philistines the adversaries unto this day he broke their horn for
ever

479 In all his works he gave thanks to the holy one and to the most
High with words of glory

4710 With his whole heart he praised the Lord and loved God that
made him and he gave him power against his enemies

4711 And he set singers before the altar and by their voices he made
sweet melody

4712 And to the festivals he added beauty and set in order the
solemn times even to the end of his life that they should praise the
holy name of the Lord and magnify the holiness of God in the morning

4713 The Lord took away his sins and exalted his horn for ever and
he gave him a covenant of the kingdom and a throne of glory in Israel

4714 After him arose up a wise son and for his sake he cast down all
the power of the enemies

4715 Solomon reigned in days of peace and God brought all his
enemies under him that he might build a house in his name and prepare
a sanctuary for ever O how wise wast thou in thy youth

4716 And thou wast filled as a river with wisdom and thy soul
covered the earth

4717 And thou didst multiply riddles in parables thy name went
abroad to the islands far off and thou wast beloved in thy peace

4718 The countries wondered at thee for thy canticles and proverbs
and parables and interpretations

4719 And at the name of the Lord God whose surname is God of
Israel

4720 Thou didst gather gold as copper and didst multiply silver as
lead

4721 And thou didst bow thyself to women and by thy body thou wast
brought under subjection

4722 Thou hast stained thy glory and defiled thy seed so as to bring
wrath upon thy children and to have thy folly kindled

4723 That thou shouldst make the kingdom to be divided and out of
Ephraim a rebellious kingdom to rule

4724 But God will not leave off his mercy and he will not destroy
nor abolish his own works neither will he cut up by the roots the
offspring of his elect and he will not utterly take away the seed of
him that loveth the Lord

4725 Wherefore he gave a remnant to Jacob and to David of the same
stock

4726 And Solomon had an end with his fathers

4727 And he left behind him of his seed the folly of the nation

4728 Even Roboam that had little wisdom who turned away the people
through his counsel

4729 And Jeroboam the son of Nabat who caused Israel to sin and
shewed Ephraim the way of sin and their sins were multiplied
exceedingly

4730 They removed them far away from their land

4731 And they sought out all iniquities till vengeance came upon
them and put an end to all their sins



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 48


The praise of Elias of Eliseus of Ezechias and of Isaias

481 And Elias the prophet stood up as a fire and his word burnt
like a torch

482 He brought a famine upon them and they that provoked him in
their envy were reduced to a small number for they could not endure
the commandments of the Lord

483 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven and he brought
down fire from heaven thrice

484 Thus was Elias magnified in his wondrous works And who can glory
like to thee

485 Who raisedst up a dead man from below from the lot of death by
the word of the Lord God

486 Who broughtest down kings to destruction and brokest easily
their power in pieces and the glorious from their bed

487 Who heardest judgment in Sina and in Horeb the judgments of
vengeance

488 Who anointedst kings to penance and madest prophets successors
after thee

489 Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire in a chariot of fiery
horses

4810 Who art registered in the judgments of times to appease the
wrath of the Lord to reconcile the heart of the father to the son and
to restore the tribes of Jacob

4811 Blessed are they that saw thee and were honoured with thy
friendship

4812 For we live only in our life but after death our name shall not
be such

4813 Elias was indeed covered with the whirlwind and his spirit was
filled up in Eliseus in his days he feared not the prince and no man
was more powerful than he

4814 No word could overcome him and after death his body prophesied

4815 In his life he did great wonders and in death he wrought
miracles

4816 For all this the people repented not neither did they depart
from their sins till they were cast out of their land and were
scattered through all the earth

4817 And there was left but a small people and a prince in the house
of David

4818 Some of these did that which pleased God but others committed
many sins

4819 Ezechias fortified his city and brought in water into the midst
thereof and he digged a rock with iron and made a well for water

4820 In his days Sennacherib came up and sent Rabsaces and lifted
up his hand against them and he stretched out his hand against Sion
and became proud through his power

4821 Then their hearts and hands trembled and they were in pain as
women in travail

4822 And they called upon the Lord who is merciful and spreading
their hands they lifted them up to heaven and the holy Lord God
quickly heard their voice

4823 He was not mindful of their sins neither did he deliver them up
to their enemies but he purified them by the hand of Isaias the holy
prophet

4824 He overthrew the army of the Assyrians and the angel of the
Lord destroyed them

4825 For Ezechias did that which pleased God and walked valiantly in
the way of David his father which Isaias the great prophet and
faithful in the sight of God had commanded him

4826 In his days the sun wen backward and he lengthened the kings
life

4827 With a great spirit he saw the things that are to come to pass
at last and comforted the mourners in Sion

4828 He showed what should come to pass for ever and secret things
before they came



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 49


The praise of Josias of Jeremias Ezechiel and the twelve prophets
Also of Zorobabel Jesus the son of Josedech Nehemias Enoch Joseph
Seth Sem and Adam

491 The memory of Josias is like the composition of a sweet smell
made by the art of a perfumer

492 His remembrance shall be sweet as honey in every mouth and as
music at a banquet of wine

493 He was directed by God unto the repentance of the nation and he
took away the abominations of wickedness

494 And he directed his heart towards the Lord and in the days of
sinners he strengthened godliness

495 Except David and Ezechias and Josias all committed sin

496 For the kings of Juda forsook the law of the most High and
despised the fear of God

497 So they gave their kingdom to others and their glory to a
strange nation

498 They burnt the chosen city of holiness and made the streets
thereof desolate according to the prediction of Jeremias

499 For they treated him evil who was consecrated a prophet from his
mothers womb to overthrow and pluck up and destroy and to build
again and renew

4910 It was Ezechiel that saw the glorious vision which was shewn
him upon the chariot of cherubims

4911 For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain and
of doing good to them that shewed right ways

4912 And may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up out of their
place for they strengthened Jacob and redeemed themselves by strong
faith

4913 How shall we magnify Zorobabel for he was as a signet on the
right hand

4914 In like manner Jesus the son of Josedec who in their days built
the house and set up a holy temple to the Lord prepared for
everlasting glory

4915 And let Nehemias be a long time remembered who raised up for us
our walls that were cast down and set up the gates and the bars who
rebuilt our houses

4916 No man was born upon earth like Henoch for he also was taken up
from the earth

4917 Nor as Joseph who was a man born prince of his brethren the
support of his family the ruler of his brethren the stay of the
people

4918 And his bones were visited and after death they prophesied

They prophesied  That is by their being carried out of Egypt they
verified the prophetic prediction of Joseph Gen 50

4919 Seth and Sem obtained glory among men and above every soul Adam
in the beginning



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 50


The praises of Simon the high priest The conclusion

501 Simon the high priest the son of Onias who in his life propped
up the house and in his days fortified the temple

502 By him also the height of the temple was founded the double
building and the high walls of the temple

503 In his days the wells of water flowed out and they were filled
as the sea above measure

504 He took care of his nation and delivered it from destruction

505 He prevailed to enlarge the city and obtained glory in his
conversation with the people and enlarged the entrance of the house
and the court

506 He shone in his days as the morning star in the midst of a cloud
and as the moon at the full

507 And as the sun when it shineth so did he shine in the temple of
God

508 And as the rainbow giving light in bright clouds and as the
flower of roses in the days of the spring and as the lilies that are
on the brink of the water and as the sweet smelling frankincense in
the time of summer

509 As a bright fire and frankincense burning in the fire

5010 As a massy vessel of gold adorned with every precious stone

5011 As an olive tree budding forth and a cypress tree rearing
itself on high when he put on the robe of glory and was clothed with
the perfection of power

Clothed with the perfection of power  That is with all the vestments
denoting his dignity and authority

5012 When he went up to the holy altar he honoured the vesture of
holiness

5013 And when he took the portions out of the hands of the priests
he himself stood by the altar And about him was the ring of his
brethren and as the cedar planted in mount Libanus

5014 And as branches of palm trees they stood round about him and
all the sons of Aaron in their glory

5015 And the oblation of the Lord was in their hands before all the
congregation of Israel and finishing his service on the altar to
honour the offering of the most high King

5016 He stretched forth his hand to make a libation and offered of
the blood of the grape

5017 He poured out at the foot of the altar a divine odour to the
most high Prince

5018 Then the sons of Aaron shouted they sounded with beaten
trumpets and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance before
God

5019 Then all the people together made haste and fell down to the
earth upon their faces to adore the Lord their God and to pray to the
Almighty God the most High

5020 And the singers lifted up their voices and in the great house
the sound of sweet melody was increased

5021 And the people in prayer besought the Lord the most High until
the worship of the Lord was perfected and they had finished their
office

5022 Then coming down he lifted up his hands over all the
congregation of the children of Israel to give glory to God with his
lips and to glory in his name

5023 And he repeated his prayer willing to shew the power of God

5024 And now pray ye to the God of all who hath done great things in
all the earth who hath increased our days from our mothers womb and
hath done with us according to his mercy

5025 May he grant us joyfulness of heart and that there be peace in
our days in Israel for ever

5026 That Israel may believe that the mercy of God is with us to
deliver us in his days

5027 There are two nations which my soul abhorreth and the third is
no nation which I hate

Abhorreth  Viz with a holy indignation as enemies of God and
persecutors of his people Such were then the Edomites who abode in
mount Seir the Philistines and the Samaritans who dwelt in Sichem
and had their schismatical temple in that neighbourhood

5028 They that sit on mount Seir and the Philistines and the
foolish people that dwell in Sichem

5029 Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem hath written in this book
the doctrine of wisdom and instruction who renewed wisdom from his
heart

5030 Blessed is he that is conversant in these good things and he
that layeth them up in his heart shall be wise always

5031 For if he do them he shall be strong to do all things because
the light of God guideth his steps



Ecclesiasticus Chapter 51


A prayer of praise and thanksgiving

511 A prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach I will give glory to thee O
Lord O King and I will praise thee O God my Saviour

512 I will give glory to thy name for thou hast been a helper and
protector to me

513 And hast preserved my body from destruction from the snare of an
unjust tongue and from the lips of them that forge lies and in the
sight of them that stood by thou hast been my helper

514 And thou hast delivered me according to the multitude of the
mercy of thy name from them that did roar prepared to devour

515 Out of the hands of them that sought my life and from the gates
of afflictions which compassed me about

516 From the oppression of the flame which surrounded me and in the
midst of the fire I was not burnt

517 From the depth of the belly of hell and from an unclean tongue
and from lying words from an unjust king and from a slanderous
tongue

518 My soul shall praise the Lord even to death

519 And my life was drawing near to hell beneath

5110 They compassed me on every side and there was no one that would
help me I looked for the succour of men and there was none

5111 I remembered thy mercy O Lord and thy works which are from
the beginning of the world

5112 How thou deliverest them that wait for thee O Lord and savest
them out of the hands of the nations

5113 Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I have
prayed for death to pass away

5114 I called upon the Lord the father of my Lord that he would not
leave me in the day of my trouble and in the time of the proud without
help

5115 I will praise thy name continually and will praise it with
thanksgiving and my prayer was heard

5116 And thou hast saved me from destruction and hast delivered me
from the evil time

5117 Therefore I will give thanks and praise thee and bless the
name of the Lord

5118 When I was yet young before I wandered about I sought for
wisdom openly in my prayer

5119 I prayed for her before the temple and unto the very end I will
seek after her and she flourished as a grape soon ripe

5120 My heart delighted in her my foot walked in the right way from
my youth up I sought after her

5121 I bowed down my ear a little and received her

5122 I found much wisdom in myself and profited much therein

5123 To him that giveth me wisdom will I give glory

5124 For I have determined to follow her I have had a zeal for good
and shall not be confounded

5125 My soul hath wrestled for her and in doing it I have been
confirmed

5126 I stretched forth my hands on high and I bewailed my ignorance
of her

5127 I directed my soul to her and in knowledge I found her

5128 I possessed my heart with her from the beginning therefore I
shall not be forsaken

5129 My entrails were troubled in seeking her therefore shall I
possess a good possession

5130 The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward and with it I
will praise him

5131 Draw near to me ye unlearned and gather yourselves together
into the hours of discipline

5132 Why are ye slow and what do you say of these things your souls
are exceeding thirsty

5133 I have opened my mouth and have spoken buy her for yourselves
without silver

5134 And submit your neck to the yoke and let your soul receive
discipline for she is near at hand to be found

5135 Behold with your eyes how I have laboured a little and have
found much rest to myself

5136 Receive ye discipline as a great sum of money and possess
abundance of gold by her

5137 Let your soul rejoice in his mercy and you shall not be
confounded in his praise

5138 Work your work before the time and he will give you your reward
in his time




THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAS



This inspired writer is called by the Holy Ghost the great prophet
Ecclesiasticus 4825 from the greatness of his prophetic spirit by
which he hath foretold so long before and in so clear a manner the
coming of Christ the mysteries of our redemption the calling of the
Gentiles and the glorious establishment and perpetual flourishing of
the church of Christ insomuch that he may seem to have been rather an
evangelist than a prophet His very name is not without mystery for
Isaias in Hebrew signifies the salvation of the Lord or Jesus is the
Lord He was according to the tradition of the Hebrews of the blood
royal of the kings of Juda and after a most holy life ended his days
by a glorious martyrdom being sawed in two at the command of his
wicked son in law King Manasses for reproving his evil ways



Isaias Chapter 1


The prophet complains of the sins of Juda and Jerusalem and exhorts
them to a sincere conversion

11 The vision of Isaias the Son of Amos which he saw concerning Juda
and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias Joathan Achaz and Ezechias kings
of Juda

12 Hear O ye heavens and give ear O earth for the Lord hath
spoken I have brought up children and exalted them but they have
despised me

13 The ox knoweth his owner and the ass his masters crib but
Israel hath not known me and my people hath not understood

14 Woe to the sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a wicked
seed ungracious children they have forsaken the Lord they have
blasphemed the Holy One of Israel they are gone away backwards

15 For what shall I strike you any more you that increase
transgression the whole head is sick and the whole heart is sad

16 From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head there is no
soundness therein wounds and bruises and swelling sores they are not
bound up nor dressed nor fomented with oil

17 Your land is desolate your cities are burnt with fire your
country strangers devour before your face and it shall be desolate as
when wasted by enemies

18 And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard
and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers and as a city that is laid
waste

19 Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed we had been as Sodom
and we should have been like to Gomorrha

110 Hear the word of the Lord ye rulers of Sodom give ear to the
law of our God ye people of Gomorrha

111 To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims
saith the Lord I am full I desire not holocausts of rams and fat of
fatlings and blood of calves and lambs and buck goats

112 When you came to appear before me who required these things at
your hands that you should walk in my courts

113 Offer sacrifice no more in vain incense is an abomination to me
The new moons and the sabbaths and other festivals I will not abide
your assemblies are wicked

114 My soul hateth your new moons and your solemnities they are
become troublesome to me I am weary of bearing them

115 And when you stretch forth your hands I will turn away my eyes
from you and when you multiply prayer I will not hear for your hands
are full of blood

116 Wash yourselves be clean take away the evil of your devices
from my eyes cease to do perversely

117 Learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge for
the fatherless defend the widow

118 And then come and accuse me saith the Lord if your sins be as
scarlet they shall be made as white as snow and if they be red as
crimson they shall be white as wool

119 If you be willing and will hearken to me you shall eat the good
things of the land

120 But if you will not and will provoke me to wrath the sword
shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it

121 How is the faithful city that was full of judgment become a
harlot justice dwelt in it but now murderers

122 Thy silver is turned into dross thy wine is mingled with water

123 Thy princes are faithless companions of thieves they all love
bribes they run after rewards They judge not for the fatherless and
the widows cause cometh not in to them

124 Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts the mighty one of
Israel Ah I will comfort myself over my adversaries and I will be
revenged of my enemies

125 And I will turn my hand to thee and I will clean purge away thy
dross and I will take away all thy tin

126 And I will restore thy judges as they were before and thy
counsellors as of old After this thou shalt be called the city of the
just a faithful city

127 Sion shall be redeemed in judgment and they shall bring her back
in justice

128 And he shall destroy the wicked and the sinners together and
they that have forsaken the Lord shall be consumed

129 For they shall be confounded for the idols to which they have
sacrificed and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have
chosen

130 When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off and as a
garden without water

131 And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow and your work as
a spark and both shall burn together and there shall be none to
quench it



Isaias Chapter 2


All nations shall flow to the church of Christ The Jews shall be
rejected for their sins Idolatry shall be destroyed

21 The word that Isaias the son of Amos saw concerning Juda and
Jerusalem

22 And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall
be prepared on the top of mountains and it shall be exalted above the
hills and all nations shall flow unto it

The last days  The whole time of the new law from the coming of
Christ till the end of the world is called in the scripture the last
days because no other age or time shall come after it but only
eternityIbid On the top of mountains etc  This shews the
perpetual visibility of the church of Christ for a mountain upon the
top of mountains cannot be hid

23 And many people shall go and say Come and let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob and he will
teach us his ways and we will walk in his paths for the law shall
come forth from Sion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem

24 And he shall judge the Gentiles and rebuke many people and they
shall turn their swords into ploughshares and their spears into
sickles nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall
they be exercised any more to war

25 O house of Jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the
Lord

26 For thou hast cast off thy people the house of Jacob because
they are filled as in times past and have had soothsayers as the
Philistines and have adhered to strange children

27 Their land is filled with silver and gold and there is no end of
their treasures

28 And their land is filled with horses and their chariots are
innumerable Their land also is full of idols they have adored the
work of their own hands which their own fingers have made

29 And man hath bowed himself down and man hath been debased
therefore forgive them not

210 Enter thou into the rock and hide thee in the pit from the face
of the fear of the Lord and from the glory of his majesty

211 The lofty eyes of man are humbled and the haughtiness of men
shall be made to stoop and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that
day

212 Because the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that
is proud and highminded and upon every one that is arrogant and he
shall be humbled

213 And upon all the tall and lofty cedars of Libanus and upon all
the oaks of Basan

214 And upon all the high mountains and upon all the elevated hills

215 And upon every high tower and every fenced wall

216 And upon all the ships of Tharsis and upon all that is fair to
behold

217 And the loftiness of men shall be bowed down and the haughtiness
of men shall be humbled and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that
day

218 And idols shall be utterly destroyed

Idols shall be utterly destroyed  or utterly pass away This was
verified by the establishment of Christianity And by this and other
texts of the like nature the wild system of some modern sectaries is
abundantly confuted who charge the whole Christian church with
worshipping idols for many ages

219 And they shall go into the holes of rocks and into the caves of
the earth from the face of the fear of the Lord and from the glory of
his majesty when he shall rise up to strike the earth

220 In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver and his
idols of gold which he had made for himself to adore moles and bats

221 And he shall go into the clefts of rocks and into the holes of
stones from the face of the fear of the Lord and from the glory of his
majesty when he shall rise up to strike the earth

222 Cease ye therefore from the man whose breath is in his nostrils
for he is reputed high



Isaias Chapter 3


The confusion and other evils that shall come upon the Jews for their
sins The pride of their women shall be punished

31 For behold the sovereign Lord of hosts shall take away from
Jerusalem and from Juda the valiant and the strong the whole strength
of bread and the whole strength of water

32 The strong man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and
the cunning man and the ancient

33 The captain over fifty and the honourable in countenance and the
counsellor and the architect and the skilful in eloquent speech

34 And I will give children to be their princes and the effeminate
shall rule over them

35 And the people shall rush one upon another and every man against
his neighbour the child shall make a tumult against the ancient and
the base against the honourable

36 For a man shall take hold of his brother one of the house of his
father saying Thou hast a garment be thou our ruler and let this
ruin be under thy hand

37 In that day he shall answer saying I am no healer and in my
house there is no bread nor clothing make me not ruler of the people

38 For Jerusalem is ruined and Juda is fallen because their tongue
and their devices are against the Lord to provoke the eyes of his
majesty

39 The shew of their countenance hath answered them and they have
proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom and they have not hid it woe to
their souls for evils are rendered to them

310 Say to the just man that it is well for he shall eat the fruit
of his doings

311 Woe to the wicked unto evil for the reward of his hands shall be
given him

312 As for my people their oppressors have stripped them and women
have ruled over them O my people they that call thee blessed the
same deceive thee and destroy the way of thy steps

313 The Lord standeth up to judge and he standeth to judge the
people

314 The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
people and its princes for you have devoured the vineyard and the
spoil of the poor is in your house

315 Why do you consume my people and grind the faces of the poor
saith the Lord the God of hosts

316 And the Lord said Because the daughters of Sion are haughty and
have walked with stretched out necks and wanton glances of their eyes
and made a noise as they walked with their feet and moved in a set
pace

317 The Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the daughters of
Sion and the Lord will discover their hair

318 In that day the Lord will take away the ornaments of shoes and
little moons

319 And chains and necklaces and bracelets and bonnets

320 And bodkins and ornaments of the legs and tablets and sweet
balls and earrings

321 And rings and jewels hanging on the forehead

322 And changes of apparel and short cloaks and fine linen and
crisping pins

323 And lookingglasses and lawns and headbands and fine veils

324 And instead of a sweet smell there shall be stench and instead
of a girdle a cord and instead of curled hair baldness and instead
of a stomacher haircloth

325 Thy fairest men also shall fall by the sword and thy valiant
ones in battle

326 And her gates shall lament and mourn and she shall sit desolate
on the ground



Isaias Chapter 4


After an extremity of evils that shall fall upon the Jews a remnant
shall be comforted by Christ

41 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying We
will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called
by thy name take away our reproach

42 In that day the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and
glory and the fruit of the earth shall be high and a great joy to
them that shall have escaped of Israel

The bud of the Lord  That is Christ

43 And it shall come to pass that every one that shall be left in
Sion and that shall remain in Jerusalem shall be called holy every
one that is written in life in Jerusalem

44 If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Sion
and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof by
the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning

45 And the Lord will create upon every place of mount Sion and where
he is called upon a cloud by day and a smoke and the brightness of a
flaming fire in the night for over all the glory shall be a
protection

46 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the daytime from
the heat and for a security and covert from the whirlwind and from
rain



Isaias Chapter 5


The reprobation of the Jews is foreshewn under the parable of a
vineyard A woe is pronounced against sinners the army of God shall
send against them

51 I will sing to my beloved the canticle of my cousin concerning his
vineyard My beloved had a vineyard on a hill in a fruitful place

My cousin  So the prophet calls Christ as being of his family and
kindred by descending from the house of David Ibid On a hill
etc  Literally in the horn the son of oil

52 And he fenced it in and picked the stones out of it and planted
it with the choicest vines and built a tower in the midst thereof and
set up a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring forth
grapes and it brought forth wild grapes

53 And now O ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and ye men of Juda judge
between me and my vineyard

54 What is there that I ought to do more to my vineyard that I have
not done to it was it that I looked that it should bring forth grapes
and it hath brought forth wild grapes

55 And now I will shew you what I will do to my vineyard I will take
away the hedge thereof and it shall be wasted I will break down the
wall thereof and it shall be trodden down

56 And I will make it desolate it shall not be pruned and it shall
not be digged but briers and thorns shall come up and I will command
the clouds to rain no rain upon it

57 For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel and
the man of Juda his pleasant plant and I looked that he should do
judgment and behold iniquity and do justice and behold a cry

58 Woe to you that join house to house and lay field to field even
to the end of the place shall you alone dwell in the midst of the
earth

59 These things are in my ears saith the Lord of hosts Unless many
great and fair houses shall become desolate without an inhabitant

510 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one little measure and
thirty bushels of seed shall yield three bushels

511 Woe to you that rise up early in the morning to follow
drunkenness and to drink in the evening to be inflamed with wine

512 The harp and the lyre and the timbrel and the pipe and wine
are in your feasts and the work of the Lord you regard not nor do you
consider the works of his hands

513 Therefore is my people led away captive because they had not
knowledge and their nobles have perished with famine and their
multitude were dried up with thirst

514 Therefore hath hell enlarged her soul and opened her mouth
without any bounds and their strong ones and their people and their
high and glorious ones shall go down into it

515 And man shall be brought down and man shall be humbled and the
eyes of the lofty shall be brought low

516 And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and the holy
God shall be sanctified in justice

517 And the lambs shall feed according to their order and strangers
shall eat the deserts turned into fruitfulness

518 Woe to you that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as
the rope of a cart

519 That say Let him make haste and let his work come quickly that
we may see it and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come that
we may know it

520 Woe to you that call evil good and good evil that put darkness
for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet
for bitter

521 Woe to you that are wise in your own eyes and prudent in your
own conceits

522 Woe to you that are mighty to drink wine and stout men at
drunkenness

523 That justify the wicked for gifts and take away the justice of
the just from him

524 Therefore as the tongue of the fire devoureth the stubble and
the heat of the flame consumeth it so shall their root be as ashes
and their bud shall go up as dust for they have cast away the law of
the Lord of hosts and have blasphemed the word of the Holy One of
Israel

525 Therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people
and he hath stretched out his hand upon them and struck them and the
mountains were troubles and their carcasses became as dung in the
midst of the streets For after this his anger is not turned away but
his hand is stretched out still

526 And he will lift up a sign to the nations afar off and will
whistle to them from the ends of the earth and behold they shall come
with speed swiftly

527 There is none that shall faint nor labour among them they shall
not slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins be
loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken

528 Their arrows are sharp and all their bows are bent The hoofs of
their horses shall be like the flint and their wheels like the
violence of a tempest

529 Their roaring like that of a lion they shall roar like young
lions yea they shall roar and take hold of the prey and they shall
keep fast hold of it and there shall be none to deliver it

530 And they shall make a noise against them that day like the
roaring of the sea we shall look towards the land and behold darkness
of tribulation and the light is darkened with the mist thereof



Isaias Chapter 6


A glorious vision in which the prophets lips are cleansed he
foretelleth the obstinacy of the Jews

61 In the year that king Ozias died I saw the Lord sitting upon a
throne high and elevated and his train filled the temple

62 Upon it stood the seraphims the one had six wings and the other
had six wings with two they covered his face and with two they
covered his feet and with two they flew

63 And they cried one to another and said Holy holy holy the
Lord God of hosts all the earth is full of his glory

64 And the lintels of the doors were moved at the voice of him that
cried and the house was filled with smoke

65 And I said Woe is me because I have held my peace because I am
a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people that hath
unclean lips and I have seen with my eyes the King the Lord of hosts

66 And one of the seraphims flew to me and in his hand was a live
coal which he had taken with the tongs off the altar

67 And he touched my mouth and said Behold this hath touched thy
lips and thy iniquities shall be taken away and thy sin shall be
cleansed

68 And I heard the voice of the Lord saying Whom shall I send and
who shall go for us And I said Lo here am I send me

69 And he said Go and thou shalt say to this people Hearing hear
and understand not and see the vision and know it not

610 Blind the heart of this people and make their ears heavy and
shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their
ears and understand with their heart and be converted and I heal
them

611 And I said How long O Lord And he said Until the cities be
wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land
shall be left desolate

612 And the Lord shall remove men far away and she shall be
multiplied that was left in the midst of the earth

613 And there shall be still a tithing therein and she shall turn
and shall be made a show as a turpentine tree and as an oak that
spreadeth its branches that which shall stand therein shall be a holy
seed



Isaias Chapter 7


The prophet assures king Achaz that the two kings his enemies shall not
take Jerusalem A virgin shall conceive and bear a son

71 And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Joathan the
son of Ozias king of Juda that Rasin king of Syria and Phacee the son
of Romelia king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to fight against it
but they could not prevail over it

72 And they told the house of David saying Syria hath rested upon
Ephraim and his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the
trees of the woods are moved with the wind

73 And the Lord said to Isaias Go forth to meet Achaz thou and
Jasub thy son that is left to the conduit of the upper pool in the way
of the fullers field

74 And thou shalt say to him See thou be quiet fear not and let
not thy heart be afraid of the two tails of these firebrands smoking
with the wrath of the fury of Rasin king of Syria and of the son of
Romelia

75 Because Syria hath taken counsel against thee unto the evil of
Ephraim and the son of Romelia saying

76 Let us go up to Juda and rouse it up and draw it away to us and
make the son of Tabeel king in the midst thereof

77 Thus saith the Lord God It shall not stand and this shall not
be

78 But the head of Syria is Damascus and the head of Damascus is
Rasin and within threescore and five years Ephraim shall cease to be
a people

79 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is the
son of Romelia If you will not believe you shall not continue

710 And the Lord spoke again to Achaz saying

711 Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God either unto the depth of
hell or unto the height above

712 And Achaz said I will not ask and I will not tempt the Lord

713 And he said Hear ye therefore O house of David Is it a small
thing for you to be grievous to men that you are grievous to my God
also

714 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin
shall conceive and bear a son and his name shall be called Emmanuel

715 He shall eat butter and honey that he may know to refuse the
evil and to choose the good

716 For before the child know to refuse the evil and to choose the
good the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of the face of
her two kings

717 The Lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon the
house of thy father days that have not come since the time of the
separation of Ephraim from Juda with the king of the Assyrians

718 And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall hiss
for the fly that is in the uttermost parts of the rivers of Egypt and
for the bee that is in the land of Assyria

719 And they shall come and shall all of them rest in the torrents
of the valleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all places set
with shrubs and in all hollow places

720 In that day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is hired by
them that are beyond the river by the king of the Assyrians the head
and the hairs of the feet and the whole beard

721 And it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a
young cow and two sheep

722 And for the abundance of milk he shall eat butter for butter and
honey shall every one eat that shall be left in the midst of the land

723 And it shall come to pass in that day that every place where
there were a thousand vines at a thousand pieces of silver shall
become thorns and briers

724 With arrows and with bows they shall go in thither for briers
and thorns shall be in all the land

725 And as for the hills that shall be raked with a rake the fear of
thorns and briers shall not come thither but they shall be for the ox
to feed on and the lesser cattle to tread upon



Isaias Chapter 8


The name of a child that is to be born many evils shall come upon the
Jews for their sins

81 And the Lord said to me Take thee a great book and write in it
with a mans pen Take away the spoils with speed quickly take the
prey

82 And I took unto me faithful witnesses Urias the priest and
Zacharias the son of Barachias

83 And I went to the prophetess and she conceived and bore a son
And the Lord said to me Call his name Hasten to take away the spoils
Make hast to take away the prey

84 For before the child know to call his father and his mother the
strength of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away
before the king of the Assyrians

85 And the Lord spoke to me again saying

86 Forasmuch as this people hath cast away the waters of Siloe that
go with silence and hath rather taken Rasin and the son of Romelia

87 Therefore behold the Lord will bring upon them the waters of the
river strong and many the king of the Assyrians and all his glory
and he shall come up over all his channels and shall overflow all his
banks

88 And shall pass through Juda overflowing and going over shall
reach even to the neck And the stretching out of his wings shall fill
the breadth of thy land O Emmanuel

89 Gather yourselves together O ye people and be overcome and give
ear all ye lands afar off strengthen yourselves and be overcome
gird yourselves and be overcome

810 Take counsel together and it shall be defeated speak a word
and it shall not be done because God is with us

811 For thus saith the Lord to me As he hath taught me with a
strong arm that I should not walk in the way of this people saying

812 Say ye not A conspiracy for all that this people speaketh is a
conspiracy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid

813 Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and
let him be your dread

814 And he shall be a sanctification to you But for a stone of
stumbling and for a rock of offence to the two houses of Israel for a
snare and a ruin to the inhabitants of Jerusalem

815 And very many of them shall stumble and fall and shall be broken
in pieces and shall be snared and taken

816 Bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples

817 And I will wait for the Lord who hath hid his face from the
house of Jacob and I will look for him

818 Behold I and my children whom the Lord hath given me for a sign
and for a wonder in Israel from the Lord of hosts who dwelleth in
mount Sion

819 And when they shall say to you Seek of pythons and of diviners
who mutter in their enchantments should not the people seek of their
God for the living of the dead

Seek of pythons  That is people pretending to tell future things by
a prophesying spiritIbid Should not the people seek of their God
for the living of the dead  Here is signified that it is to God we
should pray to be directed and not to seek of the dead that is of
fortunetellers dead in sin for the health of the living

820 To the law rather and to the testimony And if they speak not
according to this word they shall not have the morning light

821 And they shall pass by it they shall fall and be hungry and
when they shall be hungry they will be angry and curse their king
and their God and look upwards

822 And they shall look to the earth and behold trouble and
darkness weakness and distress and a mist following them and they
cannot fly away from their distress



Isaias Chapter 9


What joy shall come after afflictions by the birth and kingdom of
Christ which shall flourish for ever Judgments upon Israel for their
sins

91 At the first time the land of Zabulon and the land of Nephtali
was lightly touched and at the last the way of the sea beyond the
Jordan of the Galilee of the Gentiles was heavily loaded

92 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light to
them that dwelt in the region of the shadow of death light is risen

93 Thou hast multiplied the nation and hast not increased the joy
They shall rejoice before thee as they that rejoice in the harvest as
conquerors rejoice after taking a prey when they divide the spoils

94 For the yoke of their burden and the rod of their shoulder and
the sceptre of their oppressor thou hast overcome as in the day of
Madian

95 For every violent taking of spoils with tumult and garment
mingled with blood shall be burnt and be fuel for the fire

96 For a CHILD IS BORN to us and a son is given to us and the
government is upon his shoulder and his name shall be called
Wonderful Counsellor God the Mighty the Father of the world to come
the Prince of Peace

97 His empire shall be multiplied and there shall be no end of
peace he shall sit upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to
establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice from
henceforth and for ever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform
this

98 The Lord sent a word into Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel

99 And all the people of Ephraim shall know and the inhabitants of
Samaria that say in the pride and haughtiness of their heart

910 The bricks are fallen down but we will build with square stones
they have cut down the sycamores but we will change them for cedars

911 And the Lord shall set up the enemies of Rasin over him and
shall bring on his enemies in a crowd

912 The Syrians from the east and the Philistines from the west
and they shall devour Israel with open mouth For all this his
indignation is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still

913 And the people are not returned to him who hath struck them and
have not sought after the Lord of hosts

914 And the Lord shall destroy out of Israel the head and the tail
him that bendeth down and him that holdeth back in one day

915 The aged and honourable he is the head and the prophet that
teacheth lies he is the tail

916 And they that call this people blessed shall cause them to err
and they that are called blessed shall be thrown down headlong

917 Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men neither
shall he have mercy on their fatherless and widows for every one is a
hypocrite and wicked and every mouth hath spoken folly For all this
his indignation is not turned away but his hand is stretched out
still

918 For wickedness is kindled as a fire it shall devour the brier
and the thorn and shall kindle in the thicket of the forest and it
shall be wrapped up in smoke ascending on high

919 By the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is troubled and the
people shall be as fuel for the fire no man shall spare his brother

920 And he shall turn to the right hand and shall be hungry and
shall eat on the left hand and shall not be filled every one shall
eat the flesh of his own arm Manasses Ephraim and Ephraim Manasses
and they together shall be against Juda

921 After all these things his indignation is not turned away but
his hand is stretched out still



Isaias Chapter 10


Woe to the makers of wicked laws The Assyrian shall be a rod for
punishing Israel but for their pride they shall be destroyed and a
remnant of Israel saved

101 Woe to them that make wicked laws and when they write write
injustice

102 To oppress the poor in judgment and do violence to the cause of
the humble of my people that widows might be their prey and that they
might rob the fatherless

103 What will you do in the day of visitation and of the calamity
which cometh from afar to whom will ye flee for help and where will
ye leave your glory

104 That you be not bowed down under the bond and fall with the
slain In all these things his anger is not turned away but his hand
is stretched out still

105 Woe to the Assyrian he is the rod and the staff of my anger and
my indignation is in their hands

106 I will send him to a deceitful nation and I will give him a
charge against the people of my wrath to take away the spoils and to
lay hold on the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the
streets

107 But he shall not take it so and his heart shall not think so
but his heart shall be set to destroy and to cut off nations not a
few

108 For he shall say

109 Are not my princes as so many kings is not Calano as Charcamis
and Emath as Arphad is not Samaria as Damascus

1010 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idol so also their
idols of Jerusalem and of Samaria

1011 Shall I not as I have done to Samaria and her idols so do to
Jerusalem and her idols

1012 And it shall come to pass that when the Lord shall have
performed all his works in mount Sion and in Jerusalem I will visit
the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of
the haughtiness of his eyes

1013 For he hath said By the strength of my own hand I have done it
and by my own wisdom I have understood and I have removed the bounds
of the people and have taken the spoils of the princes and as a
mighty man hath pulled down them that sat on high

1014 And my hand hath found the strength of the people as a nest and
as eggs are gathered that are left so have I gathered all the earth
and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or made
the least noise

1015 Shall the axe boast itself against him that cutteth with it or
shall the saw exalt itself against him by whom it is drawn as if a rod
should lift itself up against him that lifteth it up and a staff exalt
itself which is but wood

1016 Therefore the sovereign Lord the Lord of hosts shall send
leanness among his fat ones and under his glory shall be kindled a
burning as it were the burning of a fire

1017 And the light of Israel shall be as a fire and the Holy One
thereof as a flame and his thorns and his briers shall be set on fire
and shall be devoured in one day

1018 And the glory of his forest and of his beautiful hill shall be
consumed from the soul even to the flesh and he shall run away through
fear

1019 And they that remain of the trees of his forest shall be so few
that they shall easily be numbered and a child shall write them down

1020 And it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of
Israel and they that shall escape of the house of Jacob shall lean no
more upon him that striketh them but they shall lean upon the Lord the
Holy One of Israel in truth

1021 The remnant shall be converted the remnant I say of Jacob to
the mighty God

1022 For if thy people O Israel shall be as the sand of the sea a
remnant of them shall be converted the consumption abridged shall
overflow with justice

A remnant of them shall be converted  This was partly verified in the
children of Israel who remained after the devastations of the
Assyrians in the time of king Ezechias and partly in the conversion
of a remnant of the Jews to the faithful of ChristIbid The
consumption abridged etc  That is the number of them cut short and
reduced to few shall flourish in abundance of justice

1023 For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption and an
abridgment in the midst of all the land

1024 Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts O my people
that dwellest in Sion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall strike
thee with his rod and he shall lift up his staff over thee in the way
of Egypt

1025 For yet a little and a very little while and my indignation
shall cease and my wrath shall be upon their wickedness

1026 And the Lord of hosts shall raise up a scourge against him
according to the slaughter of Madian in the rock of Oreb and his rod
over the sea and he shall lift it up in the way of Egypt

1027 And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be
taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and
the yoke shall putrefy at the presence of the oil

At the presence of the oil  That is by the sweet unction of divine
mercy

1028 He shall come into Aiath he shall pass into Magron at Machmas
he shall lay up his carriages

Into Aiath etc  Here the prophet describes the march of the
Assyrians under Sennacherib and the terror they should carry with
them and how they should suddenly be destroyed

1029 They have passed in haste Gaba is our lodging Rama was
astonished Gabaath of Saul fled away

1030 Lift up thy voice O daughter of Gallim attend O Laisa poor
Anathoth

1031 Medemena is removed ye inhabitants of Gabim take courage

1032 It is yet day enough to remain in Nobe he shall shake his hand
against the mountain of the daughter of Sion the hill of Jerusalem

1033 Behold the sovereign Lord of hosts shall break the earthen
vessel with terror and the tall of stature shall be cut down and the
lofty shall be humbled

1034 And the thickets of the forest shall be cut down with iron and
Libanus with its high ones shall fall



Isaias Chapter 11


Of the spiritual kingdom of Christ to which all nations shall repair

111 And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse and a
flower shall rise up out of his root

112 And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of
wisdom and of understanding the spirit of counsel and of fortitude
the spirit of knowledge and of godliness

113 And he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord
He shall not judge according to the sight of the eyes nor reprove
according to the hearing of the ears

114 But he shall judge the poor with justice and shall reprove with
equity the meek of the earth and he shall strike the earth with the
rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the
wicked

115 And justice shall be the girdle of his loins and faith the
girdle of his reins

116 The wolf shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie
down with the kid the calf and the lion and the sheep shall abide
together and a little child shall lead them

117 The calf and the bear shall feed their young ones shall rest
together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox

118 And the sucking child shall play on other hole of the asp and
the weaned child shall thrust his hand into the den of the basilisk

119 They shall not hurt nor shall they kill in all my holy mountain
for the earth is filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the covering
waters of the sea

1110 In that day the root of Jesse who standeth for an ensign of the
people him the Gentiles shall beseech and his sepulchre shall be
glorious

1111 And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set
his hand the second time to possess the remnant of his people which
shall be left from the Assyrians and from Egypt and from Phetros and
from Ethiopia and from Elam and from Sennaar and from Emath and
from the islands of the sea

1112 And he shall set up a standard unto the nations and shall
assemble the fugitives of Israel and shall gather together the
dispersed of Juda from the four quarters of the earth

1113 And the envy of Ephraim shall be taken away and the enemies of
Juda shall perish Ephraim shall not envy Juda and Juda shall not
fight against Ephraim

1114 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines by the
sea they together shall spoil the children of the east Edom till
Moab shall be under the rule of their hand and the children of Ammon
shall be obedient

1115 And the Lord shall lay waste the tongue of the sea of Egypt and
shall lift up his hand over the river in the strength of his spirit
and he shall strike it in the seven streams so that men may pass
through it in their shoes

1116 And there shall be a highway for the remnant of my people which
shall be left from the Assyrians as there was for Israel in the day
that he came up out of the land of Egypt



Isaias Chapter 12


A canticle of thanksgiving for the benefits of Christ

121 And thou shalt say in that day I will give thanks to thee O
Lord for thou wast angry with me thy wrath is turned away and thou
hast comforted me

122 Behold God is my saviour I will deal confidently and will not
fear because the Lord is my strength and my praise and he is become
my salvation

123 Thou shall draw waters with joy out of the saviours fountains

124 And you shall say in that day Praise ye the Lord and call upon
his name make his works known among the people remember that his name
is high

125 Sing ye to the Lord for he hath done great things shew this
forth in all the earth

126 Rejoice and praise O thou habitation of Sion for great is he
that is in the midst of thee the Holy One of Israel



Isaias Chapter 13


The desolation of Babylon

131 The burden of Babylon which Isaias the son of Amos saw

The burden of Babylon  That is a prophecy against Babylon

132 Upon the dark mountain lift ye up a banner exalt the voice lift
up the hand and let the rulers go into the gates

133 I have commanded my sanctified ones and have called my strong
ones in my wrath them that rejoice in my glory

134 The noise of a multitude in the mountains as it were of many
people the noise of the sound of kings of nations gathered together
the Lord of hosts hath given charge to the troops of war

135 To them that come from a country afar off from the end of
heaven the Lord and the instruments of his wrath to destroy the whole
land

136 Howl ye for the day of the Lord is near it shall come as a
destruction from the Lord

137 Therefore shall all hands be faint and every heart of man shall
melt

138 And shall be broken Gripings and pains shall take hold of them
they shall be in pain as a woman in labour Every one shall be amazed
at his neighbour their countenances shall be as faces burnt

139 Behold the day of the Lord shall come a cruel day and full of
indignation and of wrath and fury to lay the land desolate and to
destroy the sinners thereof out of it

1310 For the stars of heaven and their brightness shall not display
their light the sun shall be darkened in his rising and the moon
shall not shine with her light

1311 And I will visit the evils of the world and against the wicked
for their iniquity and I will make the pride of infidels to cease and
will bring down the arrogancy of the mighty

1312 A man shall be more precious than gold yea a man than the
finest of gold

1313 For this I will trouble the heaven and the earth shall be moved
out of her place for the indignation of the Lord of hosts and for the
day of his fierce wrath

1314 And they shall be as a doe fleeing away and as a sheep and
there shall be none to gather them together every man shall turn to
his own people and every one shall flee to his own land

1315 Every one that shall be found shall be slain and every one
that shall come to their aid shall fall by the sword

1316 Their inhabitants shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes
their houses shall be pillaged and their wives shall be ravished

1317 Behold I will stir up the Medes against them who shall not seek
silver nor desire gold

1318 But with their arrows they shall kill the children and shall
have no pity upon the sucklings of the womb and their eye shall not
spare their sons

1319 And that Babylon glorious among kingdoms the famous pride of
the Chaldeans shall be even as the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha

1320 It shall no more be inhabited for ever and it shall not be
founded unto generation and generation neither shall the Arabian pitch
his tents there nor shall shepherds rest there

1321 But wild beasts shall rest there and their houses shall be
filled with serpents and ostriches shall dwell there and the hairy
ones shall dance there

1322 And owls shall answer one another there in the houses thereof
and sirens in the temples of pleasure



Isaias Chapter 14


The restoration of Israel after their captivity The parable or song
insulting over the king of Babylon A prophecy against the Philistines

141 Her time is near at hand and her days shall not be prolonged
For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob and will yet choose out of
Israel and will make them rest upon their own ground and the stranger
shall be joined with them and shall adhere to the house of Jacob

142 And the people shall take them and bring them into their place
and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for
servants and handmaids and they shall make them captives that had
taken them and shall subdue their oppressors

143 And it shall come to pass in that day that when God shall give
thee rest from thy labour and from thy vexation and from the hard
bondage wherewith thou didst serve before

144 Thou shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon and
shalt say How is the oppressor come to nothing the tribute hath
ceased

145 The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked the rod of the
rulers

146 That struck the people in wrath with an incurable wound that
brought nations under in fury that persecuted in a cruel manner

147 The whole earth is quiet and still it is glad and hath rejoiced

148 The fir trees also have rejoiced over thee and the cedars of
Libanus saying Since thou hast slept there hath none come up to cut
us down

149 Hell below was in an uproar to meet thee at thy coming it
stirred up the giants for thee All the princes of the earth are risen
up from their thrones all the princes of nations

1410 All shall answer and say to thee Thou also art wounded as well
as we thou art become like unto us

1411 Thy pride is brought down to hell thy carcass is fallen down
under thee shall the moth be strewed and worms shall be thy covering

1412 How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer who didst rise in
the morning how art thou fallen to the earth that didst wound the
nations

O Lucifer  O day star All this according to the letter is spoken
of the king of Babylon It may also be applied in a spiritual sense
to Lucifer the prince of devils who was created a bright angel but
fell by pride and rebellion against God

1413 And thou saidst in thy heart I will ascend into heaven I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit in the mountain of
the covenant in the sides of the north

1414 I will ascend above the height of the clouds I will be like the
most High

1415 But yet thou shalt be brought down to hell into the depth of
the pit

1416 They that shall see thee shall turn toward thee and behold
thee Is this the man that troubled the earth that shook kingdoms

1417 That made the world a wilderness and destroyed the cities
thereof that opened not the prison to his prisoners

1418 All the kings of the nations have all of them slept in glory
every one in his own house

1419 But thou art cast out of thy grave as an unprofitable branch
defiled and wrapped up among them that were slain by the sword and
art gone down to the bottom of the pit as a rotten carcass

1420 Thou shalt not keep company with them even in burial for thou
hast destroyed thy land thou hast slain thy people the seed of the
wicked shall not be named for ever

1421 Prepare his children for slaughter for the iniquity of their
fathers they shall not rise up nor inherit the land nor fill the
face of the world with cities

1422 And I will rise up against them saith the Lord of hosts and I
will destroy the name of Babylon and the remains and the bud and the
offspring saith the Lord

1423 And I will make it a possession for the ericius and pools of
waters and I will sweep it and wear it out with a besom saith the
Lord of hosts

1424 The Lord of hosts hath sworn saying Surely as I have thought
so shall it be and as I have purposed

1425 So shall it fall out That I will destroy the Assyrian in my
land and upon my mountains tread him under foot and his yoke shall be
taken away from them and his burden shall be taken off their shoulder

1426 This is the counsel that I have purposed upon all the earth
and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all nations

1427 For the Lord of hosts hath decreed and who can disannul it and
his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it away

1428 In the year that king Achaz died was this burden

1429 Rejoice not thou whole Philistia that the rod of him that
struck thee is broken in pieces for out of the root of the serpent
shall come forth a basilisk and his seed shall swallow the bird

1430 And the firstborn of the poor shall be fed and the poor shall
rest with confidence and I will make thy root perish with famine and
I will kill thy remnant

1431 Howl O gate cry O city all Philistia is thrown down for a
smoke shall come from the north and there is none that shall escape
his troop

1432 And what shall be answered to the messengers of the nations
That the Lord hath founded Sion and the poor of his people shall hope
in him



Isaias Chapter 15


A prophecy of the desolation of the Moabites

151 The burden of Moab Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
waste it is silent because the wall of Moab is destroyed in the
night it is silent

152 The house is gone up and Dibon to the high places to mourn over
Nabo and over Medaba Moab hath howled on all their heads shall be
baldness and every beard shall be shaven

153 In their streets they are girded with sackcloth on the tops of
their houses and in their streets all shall howl and come down
weeping

154 Hesebon shall cry and Eleale their voice is heard even to Jasa
For this shall the well appointed men of Moab howl his soul shall howl
to itself

155 My heart shall cry to Moab the bars thereof shall flee unto
Segor a heifer of three years old for by the ascent of Luith they
shall go up weeping and in the way of Oronaim they shall lift up a cry
of destruction

156 For the waters of Nemrim shall be desolate for the grass is
withered away the spring is faded all the greenness is perished

157 According to the greatness of their work is their visitation
also they shall lead them to the torrent of the willows

Torrent of the willows  That is as some say the waters of Babylon
others render it a valley of the Arabians

158 For the cry is gone round about the border of Moab the howling
thereof unto Gallim and unto the well of Elim the cry thereof

159 For the waters of Dibon are filled with blood for I will bring
more upon Dibon the lion upon them that shall flee of Moab and upon
the remnant of the land



Isaias Chapter 16


The prophet prayeth for Christs coming The affliction of the Moabites
for their pride

161 Send forth O Lord the lamb the ruler of the earth from Petra
of the desert to the mount of the daughter of Sion

162 And it shall come to pass that as a bird fleeing away and as
young ones flying out of the nest so shall the daughters of Moab be in
the passage of Arnon

163 Take counsel gather a council make thy shadow as the night in
the midday hide them that flee and betray not them that wander about

164 My fugitives shall dwell with thee O Moab be thou a covert to
them from the face of the destroyer for the dust is at an end the
wretch is consumed he hath failed that trod the earth under foot

165 And a throne shall be prepared in mercy and one shall sit upon
it in truth in the tabernacle of David judging and seeking judgment
and quickly rendering that which is just

166 We have heard of the pride of Moab he is exceeding proud his
pride and his arrogancy and his indignation is more than his strength

167 Therefore shall Moab howl to Moab every one shall howl to them
that rejoice upon the brick walls tell ye their stripes

168 For the suburbs of Hesebon are desolate and the lords of the
nations have destroyed the vineyard of Sabama the branches thereof
have reached even to Jazer they have wandered in the wilderness the
branches thereof are left they are gone over the sea

169 Therefore I will lament with the weeping of Jazer the vineyard of
Sabama I will water thee with my tears O Hesebon and Eleale for the
voice of the treaders hath rushed in upon thy vintage and upon thy
harvest

1610 And gladness and joy shall be taken away from Carmel and there
shall be no rejoicing nor shouting in the vineyards He shall not tread
out wine in the press that was wont to tread it out the voice of the
treaders I have taken away

Carmel  This name is often taken to signify a fair and fruitful hill
or field such as mount Carmel is

1611 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab and my
inward parts for the brick wall

1612 And it shall come to pass when it is seen that Moab is wearied
on his high places that he shall go in to his sanctuaries to pray and
shall not prevail

1613 This is the word that the Lord spoke to Moab from that time

1614 And now the Lord hath spoken saying In three years as the
years of a hireling the glory of Moab shall be taken away for all the
multitude of the people and it shall be left small and feeble not
many



Isaias Chapter 17


Judgments upon Damascus and Samaria The overthrow of the Assyrians

171 The burden of Damascus Behold Damascus shall cease to be a city
and shall be as a ruinous heap of stones

172 The cities of Aroer shall be left for flocks and they shall rest
there and there shall be none to make them afraid

173 And aid shall cease from Ephraim and the kingdom from Damascus
and the remnant of Syria shall be as the glory of the children of
Israel saith the Lord of hosts

174 And it shall come to pass in that day that the glory of Jacob
shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall grow lean

175 And it shall be as when one gathereth in the harvest that which
remaineth and his arm shall gather the ears of corn and it shall be
as he that seeketh ears in the vale of Raphaim

176 And the fruit thereof that shall be left upon it shall be as one
cluster of grapes and as the shaking of the olive tree two or three
berries in the top of a bough or four or five upon the top of the
tree saith the Lord the God of Israel

177 In that day man shall bow down himself to his Maker and his eyes
shall look to the Holy One of Israel

178 And he shall not look to the altars which his hands made and he
shall not have respect to the things that his fingers wrought such as
groves and temples

179 In that day his strong cities shall be forsaken as the ploughs
and the corn that were left before the face of the children of Israel
and thou shalt be desolate

That were left  Viz by the Chanaanites when the children of Israel
came into their land

1710 Because thou hast forgotten God thy saviour and hast not
remembered thy strong helper therefore shalt thou plant good plants
and shalt sow strange seed

1711 In the day of thy planting shall be the wild grape and in the
morning thy seed shall flourish the harvest is taken away in the day
of inheritance and shall grieve thee much

1712 Woe to the multitude of many people like the multitude of the
roaring sea and the tumult of crowds like the noise of many waters

The multitude etc  This and all that follows to the end of the
chapter relates to the Assyrian army under Sennacherib

1713 Nations shall make a noise like the noise of waters overflowing
but he shall rebuke him and he shall flee far off and he shall be
carried away as the dust of the mountains before the wind and as a
whirlwind before a tempest

1714 In the time of the evening behold there shall be trouble the
morning shall come and he shall not be this is the portion of them
that have wasted us and the lot of them that spoiled us



Isaias Chapter 18


A woe to the Ethiopians who fed Israel with vain hopes their future
conversion

181 Woe to the land the winged cymbal which is beyond the rivers of
Ethiopia

182 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea and in vessels of bulrushes
upon the waters Go ye swift angels to a nation rent and torn in
pieces to a terrible people after which there is no other to a
nation expecting and trodden underfoot whose land the rivers have
spoiled

Angels  Or messengers

183 All ye inhabitants of the world who dwell on the earth when the
sign shall be lifted up on the mountains you shall see and you shall
hear the sound of the trumpet

184 For thus saith the Lord to me I will take my rest and consider
in my place as the noon light is clear and as a cloud of dew in the
day of harvest

185 For before the harvest it was all flourishing and it shall bud
without perfect ripeness and the sprigs thereof shall be cut off with
pruning hooks and what is left shall be cut away and shaken out

186 And they shall be left together to the birds of the mountains
and the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall be upon them all the
summer and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them

187 At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts
from a people rent and torn in pieces from a terrible people after
which there hath been no other from a nation expecting expecting and
trodden under foot whose land the rivers have spoiled to the place of
the name of the Lord of hosts to mount Sion



Isaias Chapter 19


The punishment of Egypt their call to the church

191 The burden of Egypt Behold the Lord will ascend upon a swift
cloud and will enter into Egypt and the idols of Egypt shall be moved
at his presence and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst
thereof

192 And I will set the Egyptians to fight against the Egyptians and
they shall fight brother against brother and friend against friend
city against city kingdom against kingdom

193 And the spirit of Egypt shall be broken in the bowels thereof
and I will cast down their counsel and they shall consult their idols
and their diviners and their wizards and soothsayers

194 And I will deliver Egypt into the hand of cruel masters and a
strong king shall rule over them saith the Lord the God of hosts

195 And the water of the sea shall be dried up and the river shall
be wasted and dry

196 And the rivers shall fail the streams of the banks shall be
diminished and be dried up The reed and the bulrush shall wither
away

197 The channel of the river shall be laid bare from its fountain
and every thing sown by the water shall be dried up it shall wither
away and shall be no more

198 The fishers also shall mourn and all that cast a hook into the
river shall lament and they that spread nets upon the waters shall
languish away

199 They shall be confounded that wrought in flax combing and
weaving fine linen

1910 And its watery places shall be dry all they shall mourn that
made pools to take fishes

1911 The princes of Tanis are become fools the wise counsellors of
Pharao have given foolish counsel how will you say to Pharao I am the
son of the wise the son of ancient kings

1912 Where are now thy wise men let them tell thee and shew what
the Lord of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt

1913 The princes of Tanis are become fools the princes of Memphis
are gone astray they have deceived Egypt the stay of the people
thereof

1914 The Lord hath mingled in the midst thereof the spirit of
giddiness and they have caused Egypt to err in all its works as a
drunken man staggereth and vomiteth

1915 And there shall be no work for Egypt to make head or tail him
that bendeth down or that holdeth back

1916 In that day Egypt shall be like unto women and they shall be
amazed and afraid because of the moving of the hand of the Lord of
hosts which he shall move over it

1917 And the land of Juda shall be a terror to Egypt everyone that
shall remember it shall tremble because of the counsel of the Lord of
hosts which he hath determined concerning it

1918 In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt
speaking the language of Chanaan and swearing by the Lord of hosts
one shall be called the city of the sun

1919 In that day there shall be an altar of the Lord in the midst of
the land of Egypt and a monument of the Lord at the borders thereof

1920 It shall be for a sign and for a testimony to the Lord of hosts
in the land of Egypt For they shall cry to the Lord because of the
oppressor and he shall send them a Saviour and a defender to deliver
them

1921 And the Lord shall be known by Egypt and the Egyptians shall
know the Lord in that day and shall worship him with sacrifices and
offerings and they shall make vows to the Lord and perform them

1922 And the Lord shall strike Egypt with a scourge and shall heal
it and they shall return to the Lord and he shall be pacified towards
them and heal them

1923 In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to the Assyrians
and the Assyrian shall enter into Egypt and the Egyptian to the
Assyrians and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrian

1924 In that day shall Israel be the third to the Egyptian and the
Assyrian a blessing in the midst of the land

1925 Which the Lord of hosts hath blessed saying Blessed be my
people of Egypt and the work of my hands to the Assyrian but Israel
is my inheritance



Isaias Chapter 20


The ignominious captivity of the Egyptians and the Ethiopians

201 In the year that Tharthan entered into Azotus when Sargon the
king of the Assyrians had sent him and he had fought against Azotus
and had taken it

202 At that same time the Lord spoke by the hand of Isaias the son of
Amos saying Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins and take
off thy shoes from thy feet And he did so and went naked and
barefoot

203 And the Lord said As my servant Isaias hath walked naked and
barefoot it shall be a sign and a wonder of three years upon Egypt
and upon Ethiopia

204 So shall the king of the Assyrians lead away the prisoners of
Egypt and the captivity of Ethiopia young and old naked and
barefoot with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt

205 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their hope and
of Egypt their glory

206 And the inhabitants of this isle shall say in that day Lo this
was our hope to whom we fled for help to deliver us from the face of
the king of the Assyrians and how shall we be able to escape



Isaias Chapter 21


The destruction of Babylon by the Medes and Persians a prophecy
against the Edomites and the Arabians

211 The burden of the desert of the sea As whirlwinds come from the
south it cometh from the desert from a terrible land

The desert of the sea  So Babylon is here called because from a city
as full of people as the sea is with water it was become a desert

212 A grievous vision is told me he that is unfaithful dealeth
unfaithfully and he that is a spoiler spoileth Go up O Elam
besiege O Mede I have made all the mourning thereof to cease

O Elam  That is O Persia

213 Therefore are my loins filled with pain anguish hath taken hold
of me as the anguish of a woman in labour I fell down at the hearing
of it I was troubled at the seeing of it

214 My heart failed darkness amazed me Babylon my beloved is become
a wonder to me

215 Prepare the table behold in the watchtower them that eat and
drink arise ye princes take up the shield

216 For thus hath the Lord said to me Go and set a watchman and
whatsoever he shall see let him tell

217 And he saw a chariot with two horsemen a rider upon an ass and
a rider upon a camel and he beheld them diligently with much heed

A rider upon an ass etc  These two riders are the kings of the
Persians and Medes

218 And a lion cried out I am upon the watchtower of the Lord
standing continually by day and I am upon my ward standing whole
nights

And a lion cried out  That is I Isaias seeing the approaching ruin
of Babylon have cried out as a lion roaring

219 Behold this man cometh the rider upon the chariot with two
horsemen and he answered and said Babylon is fallen she is fallen
and all the graven gods thereof are broken unto the ground

2110 O my thrashing and the children of my floor that which I have
heard of the Lord of hosts the God of Israel I have declared unto
you

2111 The burden of Duma calleth to me out of Seir Watchman what of
the night watchman what of the night

Duma  That is Idumea or Edom

2112 The watchman said The morning cometh also the night if you
seek seek return come

2113 The burden in Arabia In the forest at evening you shall sleep
in the paths of Dedanim

2114 Meeting the thirsty bring him water you that inhabit the land
of the south meet with bread him that fleeth

2115 For they are fled from before the swords from the sword that
hung over them from the bent bow from the face of a grievous battle

2116 For thus saith the Lord to me Within a year according to the
years of a hireling all the glory of Cedar shall be taken away

Cedar  Arabia

2117 And the residue of the number of strong archers of the children
of Cedar shall be diminished for the Lord the God of Israel hath
spoken it



Isaias Chapter 22


The prophet laments the devastation of Juda He foretells the
deprivation of Sobna and the substitution of Eliacim a figure of
Christ

221 The burden of the valley of vision What aileth thee also that
thou too art wholly gone up to the housetops

The valley of vision  Jerusalem The temple of Jerusalem was built
upon mount Moria or the mountain of vision But the city is here
called the valley of vision either because it was lower than the
temple or because of the low condition to which it was to be reduced

222 Full of clamour a populous city a joyous city thy slain are
not slain by the sword nor dead in battle

223 All the princes are fled together and are bound hard all that
were found are bound together they are fled far off

224 Therefore have I said Depart from me I will weep bitterly
labour not to comfort me for the devastation of the daughter of my
people

225 For it is a day of slaughter and of treading down and of weeping
to the Lord the God of hosts in the valley of vision searching the
wall and magnificent upon the mountain

226 And Elam took the quiver the chariot of the horseman and the
shield was taken down from the wall

227 And thy choice valleys shall be full of chariots and the
horsemen shall place themselves in the gate

228 And the covering of Juda shall be discovered and thou shalt see
in that day the armoury of the house of the forest

229 And you shall see the breaches of the city of David that they
are many and you have gathered together the waters of the lower pool

2210 And have numbered the houses of Jerusalem and broken down
houses to fortify the wall

2211 And you made a ditch between the two walls for the water of the
old pool and you have not looked up to the maker thereof nor regarded
him even at a distance that wrought it long ago

2212 And the Lord the God of hosts in that day shall call to
weeping and to mourning to baldness and to girding with sackcloth

2213 And behold joy and gladness killing calves and slaying rams
eating flesh and drinking wine Let us eat and drink for to morrow we
shall die

2214 And the voice of the Lord of hosts was revealed in my ears
Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till you die saith the
Lord God of hosts

2215 Thus saith the Lord God of hosts Go get thee in to him that
dwelleth in the tabernacle to Sobna who is over the temple and thou
shalt say to him

2216 What dost thou here or as if thou wert somebody here for thou
hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here thou hast hewed out a monument
carefully in a high place a dwelling for thyself in a rock

2217 Behold the Lord will cause thee to be carried away as a cock is
carried away and he will lift thee up as a garment

2218 He will crown thee with a crown of tribulation he will toss
thee like a ball into a large and spacious country there shalt thou
die and there shall the chariot of thy glory be the shame of the
house of thy Lord

2219 And I will drive thee out from thy station and depose thee from
thy ministry

2220 And it shall come to pass in that day that I will call my
servant Eliacim the son of Helcias

2221 And I will clothe him with thy robe and will strengthen him
with thy girdle and will give thy power into his hand and he shall be
as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Juda

2222 And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder
and he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none
shall open

2223 And I will fasten him as a peg in a sure place and he shall be
for a throne of glory to the house of his father

2224 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers
house divers kinds of vessels every little vessel from the vessels
of cups even to every instrument of music

2225 In that day saith the Lord of hosts shall the peg be removed
that was fastened in the sure place and it shall be broken and shall
fall and that which hung thereon shall perish because the Lord hath
spoken it



Isaias Chapter 23


The destruction of Tyre It shall be repaired again after seventy
years

231 The burden of Tyre Howl ye ships of the sea for the house is
destroyed from whence they were wont to come from the land of Cethim
it is revealed to them

232 Be silent you that dwell in the island the merchants of Sidon
passing over the sea have filled thee

233 The seed of the Nile in many waters the harvest of the river is
her revenue and she is become the mart of the nations

234 Be thou ashamed O Sidon for the sea speaketh even the strength
of the sea saying I have not been in labour nor have I brought
forth nor have I nourished up young men nor brought up virgins

235 When it shall be heard in Egypt they will be sorry when they
shall hear of Tyre

236 Pass over the seas howl ye inhabitants of the island

237 Is not this your city which gloried from of old in her
antiquity her feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn

238 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre that was formerly
crowned whose merchants were princes and her traders the nobles of
the earth

239 The Lord of hosts hath designed it to pull down the pride of all
glory and bring to disgrace all the glorious ones of the earth

2310 Pass thy land as a river O daughter of the sea thou hast a
girdle no more

2311 He stretched out his hand over the sea he troubled kingdoms
the Lord hath given a charge against Chanaan to destroy the strong
ones thereof

2312 And he said Thou shalt glory no more O virgin daughter of
Sidon who art oppressed arise and sail over to Cethim there also
thou shalt have no rest

2313 Behold the land of the Chaldeans there was not such a people
the Assyrians founded it they have led away the strong ones thereof
into captivity they have destroyed the houses thereof they have
brought it to ruin

2314 Howl O ye ships of the sea for your strength is laid waste

2315 And it shall come to pass in that day that thou O Tyre shalt
be forgotten seventy years according to the days of one king but
after seventy years there shall be unto Tyre as the song of a harlot

2316 Take a harp go about the city harlot that hast been forgotten
sing well sing many a song that thou mayst be remembered

2317 And it shall come to pass after seventy years that the Lord
will visit Tyre and will bring her back again to her traffic and she
shall commit fornication again with all the kingdoms of the world upon
the face of the earth

2318 And her merchandise and her hire shall be sanctified to the
Lord they shall not be kept in store nor laid up for her merchandise
shall be for them that shall dwell before the Lord that they may eat
unto fulness and be clothed for a continuance

Sanctified to the Lord  This alludes to the conversion of the
Gentiles



Isaias Chapter 24


The judgments of God upon all the sinners of the world A remnant shall
joyfully praise him

241 Behold the Lord shall lay waste the earth and shall strip it
and shall afflict the face thereof and scatter abroad the inhabitants
thereof

242 And it shall be as with the people so with the priest and as
with the servant so with his master as with the handmaid so with her
mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the lender so
with the borrower as with him that calleth for his money so with him
that oweth

243 With desolation shall the earth be laid waste and it shall be
utterly spoiled for the Lord hath spoken this word

244 The earth mourned and faded away and is weakened the world
faded away the height of the people of the earth is weakened

245 And the earth is infected by the inhabitants thereof because
they have transgressed the laws they have changed the ordinance they
have broken the everlasting covenant

246 Therefore shall a curse devour the earth and the inhabitants
thereof shall sin and therefore they that dwell therein shall be mad
and few men shall be left

247 The vintage hath mourned the vine hath languished away all the
merry have sighed

248 The mirth of timbrels hath ceased the noise of them that rejoice
is ended the melody of the harp is silent

249 They shall not drink wine with a song the drink shall be bitter
to them that drink it

2410 The city of vanity is broken down every house is shut up no
man cometh in

2411 There shall be a crying for wine in the streets all mirth is
forsaken the joy of the earth is gone away

2412 Desolation is left in the city and calamity shall oppress the
gates

2413 For it shall be thus in the midst of the earth in the midst of
the people as if a few olives that remain should be shaken out of
the olive tree or grapes when the vintage is ended

2414 These shall lift up their voice and shall give praise when the
Lord shall be glorified they shall make a joyful noise from the sea

2415 Therefore glorify ye the Lord in instruction the name of the
Lord God of Israel in the islands of the sea

2416 From the ends of the earth we have heard praises the glory of
the just one And I said My secret to myself my secret to myself woe
is me the prevaricators have prevaricated and with the prevarication
of transgressors they have prevaricated

2417 Fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee O thou
inhabitant of the earth

2418 And it shall come to pass that he that shall flee from the
noise of the fear shall fall into the pit and he that shall rid
himself out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for the
floodgates from on high are opened and the foundations of the earth
shall be shaken

2419 With breaking shall the earth be broken with crushing shall the
earth be crushed with trembling shall the earth be moved

2420 With shaking shall the earth be shaken as a drunken man and
shall be removed as the tent of one night and the iniquity thereof
shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again

2421 And it shall come to pass that in that day the Lord shall visit
upon the host of heaven on high and upon the kings of the earth on
the earth

The host of heaven on high  The stars which in many places of the
Scripture are so called Some commentators explain that these words
here signify the demons of the air

2422 And they shall be gathered together as in the gathering of one
bundle into the pit and they shall be shut up there in prison and
after many days they shall be visited

2423 And the moon shall blush and the sun shall be ashamed when the
Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Sion and in Jerusalem and shall be
glorified in the sight of his ancients



Isaias Chapter 25


A canticle of thanksgiving for Gods judgments and benefits

251 O Lord thou art my God I will exalt O thee and give glory to
thy name for thou hast done wonderful things thy designs of old
faithful amen

252 For thou hast reduced the city to a heap the strong city to
ruin the house of strangers to be no city and to be no more built up
for ever

253 Therefore shall a strong people praise thee the city of mighty
nations shall fear thee

254 Because thou hast been a strength to the poor a strength to the
needy in his distress a refuge from the whirlwind a shadow from the
heat For the blast of the mighty is like a whirlwind beating against a
wall

255 Thou shalt bring down the tumult of strangers as heat in thirst
and as with heat under a burning cloud thou shalt make the branch of
the mighty to wither away

256 And the Lord of hosts shall make unto all people in this
mountain a feast of fat things a feast of wine of fat things full of
marrow of wine purified from the lees

257 And he shall destroy in this mountain the face of the bond with
which all people were tied and the web that he began over all nations

258 He shall cast death down headlong for ever and the Lord God
shall wipe away tears from every face and the reproach of his people
he shall take away from off the whole earth for the Lord hath spoken
it

259 And they shall say in that day Lo this is our God we have
waited for him and he will save us this is the Lord we have
patiently waited for him we shall rejoice and be joyful in his
salvation

2510 For the hand of the Lord shall rest in this mountain and Moab
shall be trodden down under him as straw is broken in pieces with the
wain

Moab  That is the reprobate whose eternal punishment from which
they can no way escape is described under these figures

2511 And he shall stretch forth his hands under him as he that
swimmeth stretcheth forth his hands to swim and he shall bring down
his glory with the dashing of his hands

2512 And the bulwarks of thy high walls shall fall and be brought
low and shall be pulled down to the ground even to the dust



Isaias Chapter 26


A canticle of thanks for the deliverance of Gods people

261 In that day shall this canticle be sung in the land of Juda Sion
the city of our strength a saviour a wall and a bulwark shall be set
therein

262 Open ye the gates and let the just nation that keepeth the
truth enter in

263 The old error is passed away thou wilt keep peace peace
because we have hoped in thee

264 You have hoped in the Lord for evermore in the Lord God mighty
for ever

265 For he shall bring down them that dwell on high the high city he
shall lay low He shall bring it down even to the ground he shall pull
it down even to the dust

266 The foot shall tread it down the feet of the poor the steps of
the needy

267 The way of the just is right the path of the just is right to
walk in

268 And in the way of thy judgments O Lord we have patiently waited
for thee thy name and thy remembrance are the desire of the soul

269 My soul hath desired thee in the night yea and with my spirit
within me in the morning early I will watch to thee When thou shalt do
thy judgments on the earth the inhabitants of the world shall learn
justice

2610 Let us have pity on the wicked but he will not learn justice
in the land of the saints he hath done wicked things and he shall not
see the glory of the Lord

2611 Lord let thy hand be exalted and let them not see let the
envious people see and be confounded and let fire devour thy enemies

2612 Lord thou wilt give us peace for thou hast wrought all our
works for us

2613 O Lord our God other lords besides thee have had dominion over
us only in thee let us remember thy name

2614 Let not the dead live let not the giants rise again therefore
hast visited and destroyed them and hast destroyed all their memory

2615 Thou hast been favourable to the nation O Lord thou hast been
favourable to the nation art thou glorified thou hast removed all the
ends of the earth far off

2616 Lord they have sought after thee in distress in the
tribulation of murmuring thy instruction was with them

2617 As a woman with child when she draweth near the time of her
delivery is in pain and crieth out in her pangs so are we become in
thy presence O Lord

2618 We have conceived and been as it were in labour and have
brought forth wind we have not wrought salvation on the earth
therefore the inhabitants of the earth have not fallen

2619 Thy dead men shall live my slain shall rise again awake and
give praise ye that dwell in the dust for thy dew is the dew of the
light and the land of the giants thou shalt pull down into ruin

2620 Go my people enter into thy chambers shut thy doors upon
thee hide thyself a little for a moment until the indignation pass
away

2621 For behold the Lord will come out of his place to visit the
iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth against him and the earth
shall disclose her blood and shall cover her slain no more

Shall cover her slain no more  This is said with relation to the
martyrs and their happy resurrection



Isaias Chapter 27


The punishment of the oppressors of Gods people The Lords favour to
his church

271 In that day the Lord with his hard and great and strong sword
shall visit leviathan the bar serpent and leviathan the crooked
serpent and shall slay the whale that is in the sea

Leviathan  That is the devil the great enemy of the people of God
He is called the bar serpent from his strength and the crooked serpent
from his wiles and the whale of the sea from the tyranny he exercises
in the sea of this world He was spiritually slain by the death of
Christ when his power was destroyed

272 In that day there shall be singing to the vineyard of pure wine

The vineyard etc  The church of Christ

273 I am the Lord that keep it I will suddenly give it drink lest
any hurt come to it I keep it night and day

I will suddenly give it drink  Or as the Hebrew may also be
rendered I will continually water it

274 There is no indignation in me who shall make me a thorn and a
brier in battle shall I march against it shall I set it on fire
together

No indignation in me etc  Viz against the church nor shall I
become as a thorn or brier in its regard or march against it or set
it on fire but it shall always take fast hold of me and keep an
everlasting peace with me

275 Or rather shall it take hold of my strength shall it make peace
with me shall it make peace with me

276 When they shall rush in unto Jacob Israel shall blossom and bud
and they shall fill the face of the world with seed

When they shall rush in etc  Some understand this of the enemies of
the true Israel that shall invade it in vain Others of the spiritual
invasion made by the apostles of Christ

277 Hath he struck him according to the stroke of him that struck
him or is he slain as he killed them that were slain by him

Hath he struck him etc  Hath God punished the carnal persecuting
Jews in proportion to their doings against Christ and his saints

278 In measure against measure when it shall be cast off thou shalt
judge it He hath meditated with his severe spirit in the day of heat

When it shall be cast off etc  When the synagogue shall be cast off
thou shalt judge it in measure and in proportion to its crimesIbid
He hath meditated etc  God hath designed severe punishments in the
day of his wrath

279 Therefore upon this shall the iniquity of the house of Jacob be
forgiven and this is all the fruit that the sin thereof should be
taken away when he shall have made all the stones of the altar as
burnt stones broken in pieces the groves and temples shall not stand

Of the house of Jacob  Viz of such of them as shall be converted

2710 For the strong city shall be desolate the beautiful city shall
be forsaken and shall be left as a wilderness there the calf shall
feed and there shall he lie down and shall consume its branches

The strong city  Jerusalem

2711 Its harvest shall be destroyed with drought women shall come
and teach it for it is not a wise people therefore he that made it
shall not have mercy on it and he that formed it shall not spare it

2712 And it shall come to pass that in that day the Lord will strike
from the channel of the river even to the torrent of Egypt and you
shall be gathered together one by one O ye children of Israel

2713 And it shall come to pass that in that day a noise shall be
made with a great trumpet and they that were lost shall come from the
land of the Assyrians and they that were outcasts in the land of
Egypt and they shall adore the Lord in the holy mount in Jerusalem

A great trumpet  The preaching of the gospel for the conversion of
the Jews



Isaias Chapter 28


The punishment of the Israelites for their pride intemperance and
contempt of religion Christ the cornerstone

281 Woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of Ephraim and to
the fading flower the glory his joy who were on the head of the fat
valley staggering with wine

Ephraim  That is the kingdom of the ten tribesIbid The head of
the fat valley  Samaria situate on a hill having under it a most
fertile valley

282 Behold the Lord is mighty and strong as a storm of hail a
destroying whirlwind as the violence of many waters overflowing and
sent forth upon a spacious land

283 The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden
under feet

284 And the fading tower the glory of his joy who is on the head of
the fat valley shall be as a hasty fruit before the ripeness of
autumn which when he that seeth it shall behold as soon he taketh it
in his hand he will eat it up

285 In that day the Lord of hosts shall be a crown of glory and a
garland of joy to the residue of his people

286 And a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and
strength to them that return out of the battle to the gate

287 But these also have been ignorant through wine and through
drunkenness have erred the priest and the prophet have been ignorant
through drunkenness they are swallowed up with wine they have gone
astray in drunkenness they have not known him that seeth they have
been ignorant of judgment

These also  The kingdom of Juda

288 For all the tables were full of vomit and filth so that there
was no more place

289 Whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to
understand the hearing them that are weaned from the milk that are
drawn away from the breasts

2810 For command command again command command again expect
expect again a little there a little there

Command command again etc  This is said in the person of the Jews
resisting the repeated commands of God and still putting him off

2811 For with the speech of lips and with another tongue he will
speak to this people

2812 To whom he said This is my rest refresh the weary and this is
my refreshing and they would not hear

2813 And the word of the Lord shall be to them Command command
again command command again expect expect again a little there a
little there that they may go and fall backward and be broken and
snared and taken

2814 Wherefore hear the word of the Lord ye scornful men who rule
over my people that is in Jerusalem

2815 For you have said We have entered into a league with death and
we have made a covenant with hell When the overflowing scourge shall
pass through it shall not come upon us for we have placed our hope in
lies and by falsehood we are protected

2816 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold I will lay a stone in
the foundations of Sion a tried stone a corner stone a precious
stone founded in the foundation He that believeth let him not
hasten

A stone in the foundations  Viz ChristIbid Let him not hasten
etc  Let him expect his coming with patience

2817 And I will set judgment in weight and justice in measure and
hail shall overturn the hope of falsehood and waters shall overflow
its protection

2818 And your league with death shall be abolished and your covenant
with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass you
shall be trodden down by it

2819 Whensoever it shall pass through it shall take you away
because in the morning early it shall pass through in the day and in
the night and vexation alone shall make you understand what you hear

2820 For the bed is straitened so that one must fall out and a
short covering cannot cover both

The bed is straitened etc  It is too narrow to hold two God will
have the bed of our heart all to himself

2821 For the Lord shall stand up as in the mountain of divisions he
shall be angry as in the valley which is in Gabaon that he may do his
work his strange work that he may perform his work his work is
strange to him

As in the mountain etc  As the Lord fought against the Philistines
in Baal Pharasim 2 Kings 5 and against the Chanaanites in the
valley of Gabaon Jos 10

2822 And now do not mock lest your bonds be tied strait For I have
heard of the Lord the God of hosts a consumption and a cutting short
upon all the earth

2823 Give ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech

2824 Shall the ploughman plough all the day to sow shall he open and
harrow his ground

2825 Will he not when he hath made plain the surface thereof sow
gith and scatter cummin and put wheat in order and barley and
millet and vetches in their bounds

2826 For he will instruct him in judgment his God will teach him

2827 For gith shall not be thrashed with saws neither shall the cart
wheel turn about upon cummin but gith shall be beaten out with a rod
and cumin with a staff

2828 But breadcorn shall be broken small but the thrasher shall not
thrash it for ever neither shall the cart wheel hurt it nor break it
with its teeth

2829 This also is come forth from the Lord God of hosts to make his
counsel wonderful and magnify justice

This also etc  Such also is the proceeding of the Lord with his
land and the divers seeds he throws therein



Isaias Chapter 29


Gods heavy judgments upon Jerusalem for their obstinacy with a
prophecy of the conversion of the Gentiles

291 Woe to Ariel to Ariel the city which David took year is added
to year the solemnities are at an end

Ariel  This word signifies the lion of God and here is taken for
the strong city of Jerusalem

292 And I will make a trench about Ariel and it shall be in sorrow
and mourning and it shall be to me as Ariel

293 And I will make a circle round about thee and I will cast up a
rampart against thee and raise up bulwarks to besiege thee

294 Thou shalt be brought down thou shall speak out of the earth
and thy speech shall be heard out of the ground and thy voice shall be
from the earth like that of the python and out of the earth thy speech
shall mutter

295 And the multitude of them that fan thee shall be like small
dust and as ashes passing away the multitude of them that have
prevailed against thee

296 And it shall be at an instant suddenly A visitation shall come
from the Lord of hosts in thunder and with earthquake and with a
great noise of whirlwind and tempest and with the flame of devouring
fire

297 And the multitude of all nations that have fought against Ariel
shall be as the dream of a vision by night and all that have fought
and besieged and prevailed against it

298 And as he that is hungry dreameth and eateth but when he is
awake his soul is empty and as he that is thirsty dreameth and
drinketh and after he is awake is yet faint with thirst and his soul
is empty so shall be the multitude of all the Gentiles that have
fought against mount Sion

299 Be astonished and wonder waver and stagger be drunk and not
with wine stagger and not with drunkenness

2910 For the Lord hath mingled for you the spirit of a deep sleep he
will shut up your eyes he will cover your prophets and princes that
see visions

2911 And the vision of all shall be unto you as the words of a book
that is sealed which when they shall deliver to one that is learned
they shall say Read this and he shall answer I cannot for it is
sealed

2912 And the book shall be given to one that knoweth no letters and
it shall be said to him Read and he shall answer I know no letters

2913 And the Lord said Forasmuch as this people draw near me with
their mouth and with their lips glorify me but their heart is far
from me and they have feared me with the commandment and doctrines of
men

2914 Therefore behold I will proceed to cause an admiration in this
people by a great and wonderful miracle for wisdom shall perish from
their wise men and the understanding of their prudent men shall be
hid

2915 Woe to you that are deep of heart to hide your counsel from the
Lord and their works are in the dark and they say Who seeth us and
who knoweth us

2916 This thought of yours is perverse as if the clay should think
against the potter and the work should say to the maker thereof Thou
madest me not or the thing framed should say to him that fashioned it
Thou understandest not

2917 Is it not yet a very little while and Libanus shall be turned
into charmel and charmel shall be esteemed as a forest

Charmel  This word signifies a fruitful field

2918 And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book and
out of darkness and obscurity the eyes of the blind shall see

2919 And the meek shall increase their joy in the Lord and the poor
men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel

2920 For he that did prevail hath failed the scorner is consumed
and they are all cut off that watched for iniquity

2921 That made men sin by word and supplanted him that reproved them
in the gate and declined in vain from the just

2922 Therefore thus saith the Lord to the house of Jacob he that
redeemed Abraham Jacob shall not now be confounded neither shall his
countenance now be ashamed

2923 But when he shall see his children the work of my hands in the
midst of him sanctifying my name and they shall sanctify the Holy One
of Jacob and shall glorify the God of Israel

2924 And they that erred in spirit shall know understanding and
they that murmured shall learn the law



Isaias Chapter 30


The people are blamed for their confidence in Egypt Gods mercies
towards his church The punishment of sinners

301 Woe to you apostate children saith the Lord that you would
take counsel and not of me and would begin a web and not by my
spirit that you might add sin upon sin

302 Who walk to go down into Egypt and have not asked at my mouth
hoping for help in the strength of Pharao and trusting in the shadow
of Egypt

303 And the strength of Pharao shall be to your confusion and the
confidence of the shadow of Egypt to your shame

304 For thy princes were in Tanis and thy messengers came even to
Hanes

305 They were all confounded at a people that could not profit them
they were no help nor to any profit but to confusion and to reproach

306 The burden of the beasts of the south In a land of trouble and
distress from whence come the lioness and the lion the viper and the
flying basilisk they carry their riches upon the shoulders of beasts
and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall
not be able to profit them

307 For Egypt shall help in vain and to no purpose therefore have I
cried concerning this It is pride only sit still

308 Now therefore go in and write for them upon box and note it
diligently in a book and it shall be in the latter days for a
testimony for ever

309 For it is a people that provoketh to wrath and lying children
that will not hear the law of God

3010 Who say to the seers See not and to them that behold Behold
not for us those things that are right speak unto us pleasant things
see errors for us

3011 Take away from me the way turn away the path from me let the
Holy One of Israel cease from before us

3012 Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel Because you have
rejected this word and have trusted in oppression and tumult and have
leaned upon it

3013 Therefore shall this iniquity be to you as a breach that
falleth and is found wanting in a high wall for the destruction
thereof shall come on a sudden when it is not looked for

3014 And it shall be broken small as the potters vessel is broken
all to pieces with mighty breaking and there shall not a sherd be
found of the pieces thereof wherein a little fire may be carried from
the hearth or a little water be drawn out of the pit

3015 For thus saith the Lord God the Holy One of Israel If you
return and be quiet you shall be saved in silence and in hope shall
your strength be And you would not

3016 But have said No but we will flee to horses therefore shall
you flee And we will mount upon swift ones therefore shall they be
swifter that shall pursue after you

3017 A thousand men shall flee for fear of one and for fear of five
shall you flee till you be left as the mast of ship on the top of a
mountain and as an ensign upon a hill

3018 Therefore the Lord waiteth that he may have mercy on you and
therefore shall he be exalted sparing you because the Lord is the God
of judgment blessed are all they that wait for him

3019 For the people of Sion shall dwell in Jerusalem weeping thou
shalt not weep he will surely have pity on thee at the voice of thy
cry as soon as he shall hear he will answer thee

3020 And the Lord will give you spare bread and short water and
will not cause thy teacher to flee away from thee any more and thy
eyes shall see thy teacher

3021 And thy ears shall hear the word of one admonishing thee behind
thy back This is the way walk ye in it and go not aside neither to
the right hand nor to the left

3022 And thou shalt defile the plates of thy graven things of silver
and the garment of thy molten things of gold and shalt cast them away
as the uncleanness of a menstruous woman Thou shalt say to it Get
thee hence

3023 And rain shall be given to thy seed wheresoever thou shalt sow
in the land and the bread of the corn of the land shall be most
plentiful and fat The lamb in that day shall feed at large in thy
possession

3024 And thy oxen and the ass colts that till the ground shall eat
mingled provender as it was winnowed in the floor

3025 And there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every
elevated hill rivers of running waters in the day of the slaughter of
many when the tower shall fall

3026 And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and
the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in
the day when the Lord shall bind up the wound of his people and shall
heal the stroke of their wound

3027 Behold the name of the Lord cometh from afar his wrath burneth
and is heavy to bear his lips are filled with indignation and his
tongue as a devouring fire

3028 His breath as a torrent overflowing even to the midst of the
neck to destroy the nations unto nothing and the bridle of error that
was in the jaws of the people

3029 You shall have a song as in the night of the sanctified
solemnity and joy of heart as where one goeth with a pipe to come
into the mountain of the Lord to the Mighty One of Israel

3030 And the Lord shall make the glory of his voice to be heard and
shall shew the terror of his arm in the threatening of wrath and the
flame of devouring fire he shall crush to pieces with whirlwind and
hailstones

3031 For at the voice of the Lord the Assyrian shall fear being
struck with the rod

3032 And the passage of the rod shall be strongly grounded which the
Lord shall make to rest upon him with timbrels and harps and in great
battles he shall overthrow them

3033 For Topheth is prepared from yesterday prepared by the king
deep and wide The nourishment thereof is fire and much wood the
breath of the Lord as a torrent of brimstone kindling it

Topheth  It is the same as Gehenna and is taken for hell



Isaias Chapter 31


The folly of trusting to Egypt and forgetting God He will fight for
his people against the Assyrians

311 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help trusting in horses
and putting their confidence in chariots because they are many and in
horsemen because they are very strong and have not trusted in the
Holy One of Israel and have not sought after the Lord

312 But he that is the wise one hath brought evil and hath not
removed his words and he will rise up against the house of the wicked
and against the aid of them that work iniquity

313 Egypt is man and not God and their horses flesh and not
spirit and the Lord shall put down his hand and the helper shall
fall and he that is helped shall fall and they shall all be
confounded together

314 For thus saith the Lord to me Like as the lion roareth and the
lions whelp upon his prey and when a multitude of shepherds shall come
against him he will not fear at their voice nor be afraid of their
multitude so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight upon mount
Sion and upon the hill thereof

315 As birds flying so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem
protecting and delivering passing over and saving

316 Return as you had deeply revolted O children of Israel

317 For in that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver and
his idols of gold which your hands have made for you to sin

318 And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword not of a man and the
sword not of a man shall devour him and he shall flee not at the face
of the sword and his young men shall be tributaries

319 And his strength shall pass away with dread and his princes
fleeing shall be afraid the Lord hath said it whose fire is in Sion
and his furnace in Jerusalem



Isaias Chapter 32


The blessings of the reign of Christ The desolation of the Jews and
prosperity of the church of Christ

321 Behold a king shall reign in justice and princes shall rule in
judgment

322 And a man shall be as when one is hid from the wind and hideth
himself from a storm as rivers of waters in drought and the shadow of
a rock that standeth out in a desert land

323 The eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them
that hear shall hearken diligently

324 And the heart of fools shall understand knowledge and the tongue
of stammerers shall speak readily and plain

325 The fool shall no more be called prince neither shall the
deceitful be called great

326 For the fool will speak foolish things and his heart will work
iniquity to practise hypocrisy and speak to the Lord deceitfully and
to make empty the soul of the hungry and take away drink from the
thirsty

327 The vessels of the deceitful are most wicked for he hath framed
devices to destroy the meek with lying words when the poor man
speaketh judgment

328 But the prince will devise such things as are worthy of a prince
and he shall stand above the rulers

329 Rise up ye rich women and hear my voice ye confident
daughters give ear to my speech

3210 For after days and a year you that are confident shall be
troubled for the vintage is at an end the gathering shall come no
more

3211 Be astonished ye rich women be troubled ye confident ones
strip you and be confounded gird your loins

3212 Mourn for your breasts for the delightful country for the
fruitful vineyard

3213 Upon the land of my people shall thorns and briers come up how
much more upon all the houses of joy of the city that rejoiced

3214 For the house is forsaken the multitude of the city is left
darkness and obscurity are come upon its dens for ever A joy of wild
asses the pastures of flocks

3215 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high and the desert
shall be as a charmel and charmel shall be counted for a forest

3216 An judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and justice shall sit
in charmel

3217 And the work of justice shall be peace and the service of
justice quietness and security for ever

3218 And my people shall sit in the beauty of peace and in the
tabernacles of confidence and in wealthy rest

3219 But hail shall be in the descent of the forest and the city
shall be made very low

3220 Blessed are ye that sow upon all waters sending thither the
foot of the ox and the ass



Isaias Chapter 33


Gods revenge against the enemies of his church The happiness of the
heavenly Jerusalem

331 Woe to thee that spoilest shalt not thou thyself also be
spoiled and thou that despisest shalt not thyself also be despised
when thou shalt have made an end of spoiling thou shalt be spoiled
when being wearied thou shalt cease to despise thou shalt be despised

That spoilest etc  This is particularly directed to Sennacherib

332 O Lord have mercy on us for we have waited for thee be thou
our arm in the morning and our salvation in the time of trouble

333 At the voice of the angel the people fled and at the lifting up
thyself the nations are scattered

334 And your spoils shall be gathered together as the locusts are
gathered as when the ditches are full of them

335 The Lord is magnified for he hath dwelt on high he hath filled
Sion with judgment and justice

336 And there shall be faith in thy times riches of salvation
wisdom and knowledge the fear of the Lord is his treasure

337 Behold they that see shall cry without the angels of peace shall
weep bitterly

The angels of peace  The messengers or deputies sent to negotiate a
peace

338 The ways are made desolate no one passeth by the road the
covenant is made void he hath rejected the cities he hath not
regarded the men

339 The land hath mourned and languished Libanus is confounded and
become foul and Saron is become as a desert and Basan and Carmel are
shaken

3310 Now will I rise up saith the Lord now will I be exalted now
will I lift up myself

3311 You shall conceive heat you shall bring forth stubble your
breath as fire shall devour you

3312 And the people shall be as ashes after a fire as a bundle of
thorns they shall be burnt with fire

3313 Hear you that are far off what I have done and you that are
near know my strength

3314 The sinners in Sion are afraid trembling hath seized upon the
hypocrites Which of you can dwell with devouring fire which of you
shall dwell with everlasting burnings

3315 He that walketh in justices and speaketh truth that casteth
away avarice by oppression and shaketh his hands from all bribes that
stoppeth his ears lest he hear blood and shutteth his eyes that he may
see no evil

3316 He shall dwell on high the fortifications of rocks shall be his
highness bread is given him his waters are sure

3317 His eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall see the
land far off

3318 Thy heart shall meditate fear where is the learned where is he
that pondered the words of the law where is the teacher of little
ones

3319 The shameless people thou shalt not see the people of profound
speech so that thou canst not understand the eloquence of his tongue
in whom there is no wisdom

3320 Look upon Sion the city of our solemnity thy eyes shall see
Jerusalem a rich habitation a tabernacle that cannot be removed
neither shall the nails thereof be taken away for ever neither shall
any of the cords thereof be broken

3321 Because only there our Lord is magnificent a place of rivers
very broad and spacious streams no ship with oars shall pass by it
neither shall the great galley pass through it

Of rivers  He speaks of the rivers of endless joys that flow from the
throne of God to water the heavenly Jerusalem where no enemys ship
can come etc

3322 For the Lord is our judge the Lord is our lawgiver the Lord is
our king he will save us

3323 Thy tacklings are loosed and they shall be of no strength thy
mast shall be in such condition that thou shalt not be able to spread
the flag Then shall the spoils of much prey be divided the lame shall
take the spoil

Thy tacklings  He speaks of the enemies of the church under the
allegory of a ship that is disabled

3324 Neither shall he that is near say I am feeble The people that
dwell therein shall have their iniquity taken away from them



Isaias Chapter 34


The general judgment of the wicked

341 Come near ye Gentiles and hear and hearken ye people let the
earth hear and all that is therein the world and every thing that
cometh forth of it

342 For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations and his fury
upon all their armies he hath killed them and delivered them to
slaughter

343 Their slain shall be cast forth and out of their carcasses shall
rise a stink the mountains shall be melted with their blood

344 And all the host of the heavens shall pine away and the heavens
shall be folded together as a book and all their host shall fall down
as the leaf falleth from the vine and from the fig tree

And all the host of the heavens  That is the sun moon and stars

345 For my sword is inebriated in heaven behold it shall come down
upon Idumea and upon the people of my slaughter unto judgment

Idumea  Under the name of Idumea or Edom a people that were enemies
of the Jews are here understood the wicked in general the enemies of
God and his church

346 The sword of the Lord is filled with blood it is made thick with
the blood of lambs and buck goats with the blood of rams full of
marrow for there is a victim of the Lord in Bosra and a great
slaughter in the land of Edom

347 And the unicorns shall go down with them and the bulls with the
mighty their land shall be soaked with blood and their ground with
the fat of fat ones

The unicorns  That is the great and mighty

348 For it is the day of the vengeance of the Lord the year of
recompenses of the judgment of Sion

The year of recompenses etc  When the persecutors of Sion that is
of the church shall receive their reward

349 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch and the
ground thereof into brimstone and the land thereof shall become
burning pitch

3410 Night and day it shall not be quenched the smoke thereof shall
go up for ever from generation to generation it shall lie waste none
shall pass through it for ever and ever

3411 The bittern and ericius shall possess it and the ibis and the
raven shall dwell in it and a line shall be stretched out upon it to
bring it to nothing and a plummet unto desolation

3412 The nobles thereof shall not be there they shall call rather
upon the king and all the princes thereof shall be nothing

3413 And thorns and nettles shall grow up in its houses and the
thistle in the fortresses thereof and it shall be the habitation of
dragons and the pasture of ostriches

3414 And demons and monsters shall meet and the hairy ones shall cry
out one to another there hath the lamia lain down and found rest for
herself

3415 There hath the ericius had its hole and brought up its young
ones and hath dug round about and cherished them in the shadow
thereof thither are the kites gathered together one to another

3416 Search ye diligently in the book of the Lord and read not one
of them was wanting one hath not sought for the other for that which
proceedeth out of my mouth he hath commanded and his spirit it hath
gathered them

3417 And he hath cast the lot for them and his hand hath divided it
to them by line they shall possess it for ever from generation to
generation they shall dwell therein



Isaias Chapter 35


The joyful flourishing of Christs kingdom in his church shall be a
holy and secure way

351 The land that was desolate and impassable shall be glad and the
wilderness shall rejoice and shall flourish like the lily

352 It shall bud forth and blossom and shall rejoice with joy and
praise the glory of Libanus is given to it the beauty of Carmel and
Saron they shall see the glory of the Lord and the beauty of our God

353 Strengthen ye the feeble hands and confirm the weak knees

354 Say to the fainthearted Take courage and fear not behold your
God will bring the revenge of recompense God himself will come and
will save you

355 Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the
deaf shall be unstopped

356 Then shall the lame man leap as a hart and the tongue of the
dumb shall be free for waters are broken out in the desert and
streams in the wilderness

357 And that which was dry land shall become a pool and the thirsty
land springs of water In the dens where dragons dwelt before shall
rise up the verdure of the reed and the bulrush

358 And a path and a way shall be there and it shall be called the
holy way the unclean shall not pass over it and this shall be unto
you a straight way so that fools shall not err therein

359 No lion shall be there nor shall any mischievous beast go up by
it nor be found there but they shall walk there that shall be
delivered

3510 And the redeemed of the Lord shall return and shall come into
Sion with praise and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads they
shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and mourning shall flee away



Isaias Chapter 36


Sennacherib invades Juda his blasphemies

361 And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Ezechias that
Sennacherib king of the Assyrians came up against all the fenced cities
of Juda and took them

362 And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsaces from Lachis to
Jerusalem to king Ezechias with a great army and he stood by the
conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fullers field

363 And there went out to him Eliacim the son of Helcias who was
over the house and Sobna the scribe and Joahe the son of Asaph the
recorder

364 And Rabsaces said to them Tell Ezechias Thus saith the great
king the king of the Assyrians What is this confidence wherein thou
trustest

365 Or with what counsel or strength dost thou prepare for war on
whom dost thou trust that thou art revolted from me

366 Lo thou trustest upon this broken staff of a reed upon Egypt
upon which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so
is Pharao king of Egypt to all that trust in him

367 But if thou wilt answer me We trust in the Lord our God is it
not he whose high places and altars Ezechias hath taken away and hath
said to Juda and Jerusalem You shall worship before this altar

368 And now deliver thyself up to my lord the king of the Assyrians
and I will give thee two thousand horses and thou wilt not be able on
thy part to find riders for them

369 And how wilt thou stand against the face of the judge of one
place of the least of my masters servants But if thou trust in
Egypt in chariots and in horsemen

3610 And am I now come up without the Lord against this land to
destroy it The Lord said to me Go up against this land and destroy
it

3611 And Eliacim and Sobna and Joahe said to Rabsaces Speak to thy
servants in the Syrian tongue for we understand it speak not to us in
the Jews language in the hearing of the people that are upon the
wall

3612 And Rabsaces said to them Hath my master sent me to thy master
and to thee to speak all these words and not rather to the men that
sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their
urine with you

3613 Then Rabsaces stood and cried out with a loud voice in the
Jews language and said Hear the words of the great king the king of
the Assyrians

3614 Thus saith the king Let not Ezechias deceive you for he shall
not be able to deliver you

3615 And let not Ezechias make you trust in the Lord saying The
Lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be given into the
hands of the king of the Assyrians

3616 Do not hearken to Ezechias for thus said the king of the
Assyrians Do with me that which is for your advantage and come out to
me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree
and drink ye every one the water of his cistern

3617 Till I come and take you away to a land like to your own a
land of corn and of wine a land of bread and vineyards

3618 Neither let Ezechias trouble you saying The Lord will deliver
us Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land out of the
hand of the king of the Assyrians

3619 Where is the god of Emath and of Arphad where is the god of
Sepharvaim have they delivered Samaria out of my hand

3620 Who is there among all the gods of these lands that hath
delivered his country out of my hand that the Lord may deliver
Jerusalem out of my hand

3621 And they held their peace and answered him not a word For the
king had commanded saying Answer him not

3622 And Eliacim the son of Helcias that was over the house and
Sobna the scribe and Joahe the son of Asaph the recorder went in to
Ezechias with their garments rent and told him the words of Rabsaces



Isaias Chapter 37


Ezechias his mourning and prayer Gods promise of protection The
Assyrian army is destroyed Sennacherib is slain

371 And it came to pass when king Ezechias had heard it that he
rent his garments and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the
house of the Lord

372 And he sent Eliacim who was over the house and Sobna the scribe
and the ancients of the priests covered with sackcloth to Isaias the
son of Amos the prophet

373 And they said to him Thus saith Ezechias This day is a day of
tribulation and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come
to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth

374 It may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabsaces whom
the king of the Assyrians his master hath sent to blaspheme the living
God and to reproach with words which the Lord thy God hath heard
wherefore lift up by prayer for the remnant that is left

375 And the servants of Ezechias came to Isaias

376 And Isaias said to them Thus shall you say to your master Thus
saith the Lord Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard with
which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me

377 Behold I will send a spirit upon him and he shall hear a
message and shall return to his own country and I will cause him to
fall by the sword in his own country

378 And Rabsaces returned and found the king of the Assyrians
besieging Lobna For he had heard that he was departed from Lachis

379 And he heard say about Tharaca the king of Ethiopia He is come
forth to fight against thee And when he heard it he sent messengers
to Ezechias saying

3710 Thus shall you speak to Ezechias the king of Juda saying Let
not thy God deceive thee in whom thou trustest saying Jerusalem
shall not be given into the hands of the king of the Assyrians

3711 Behold thou hast heard all that the kings of the Assyrians have
done to all countries which they have destroyed and canst thou be
delivered

3712 Have the gods of the nations delivered them whom my fathers have
destroyed Gozam and Haram and Reseph and the children of Eden that
were in Thalassar

3713 Where is the king of Emath and the king of Arphad and the king
of the city of Sepharvaim of Ana and of Ava

3714 And Ezechias took the letter from the hand of the messengers
and read it and went up to the house of the Lord and Ezechias spread
it before the Lord

3715 And Ezechias prayed to the Lord saying

3716 Lord of hosts God of Israel who sitteth upon the cherubims
thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made
heaven and earth

3717 Incline O Lord thy ear and hear open O Lord thy eyes and
see and hear all the words of Sennacherib which he hath sent to
blaspheme the living God

3718 For of a truth O Lord the kings of the Assyrians have laid
waste lands and their countries

3719 And they have cast their gods into the fire for they were not
gods but the works of mens hands of wood and stone and they broke
them in pieces

3720 And now O Lord our God save us out of his hand and let all
the kingdoms of the earth know that thou only art the Lord

3721 And Isaias the son of Amos sent to Ezechias saying Thus saith
the Lord the God of Israel For the prayer thou hast made to me
concerning Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians

3722 This is the word which the Lord hath spoken of him The virgin
the daughter of Sion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the
daughter of Jerusalem hath wagged the head after thee

3723 Whom hast thou reproached and whom hast thou blasphemed and
against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thy eyes on
high Against the Holy One of Israel

3724 By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord and
hast said With the multitude of my chariots I have gone up to the
height of the mountains to the top of Libanus and I will cut down its
tall cedars and its choice fir trees and will enter to the top of its
height to the forest of its Carmel

Carmel  See these figurative expressions explained in the annotations
on the nineteenth chapter of the fourth book of Kings

3725 I have digged and drunk water and have dried up with the sole
of my foot all the rivers shut up in banks

3726 Hast thou not heard what I have done to him of old from the
days of old I have formed it and now I have brought it to effect and
it hath come to pass that hills fighting together and fenced cities
should be destroyed

3727 The inhabitants of them were weak of hand they trembled and
were confounded they became like the grass of the field and the herb
of the pasture and like the grass of the housetops which withered
before it was ripe

3728 I know thy dwelling and thy going out and thy coming in and
thy rage against me

3729 When thou wast mad against me thy pride came up to my ears
therefore I will put a ring in thy nose and a bit between thy lips
and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest

3730 But to thee this shall be a sign Eat this year the things that
spring of themselves and in the second year eat fruits but in the
third year sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of
them

3731 And that which shall be saved of the house of Juda and which is
left shall take root downward and shall bear fruit upward

3732 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and salvation
from mount Sion the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this

3733 Wherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the
Assyrians He shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow into
it nor come before it with shield nor cast a trench about it

3734 By the way that he came he shall return and into this city he
shall not come saith the Lord

3735 And I will protect this city and will save it for my own sake
and for the sake of David my servant

3736 And the angel of the Lord went out and slew in the camp of the
Assyrians a hundred and eightyfive thousand And they arose in the
morning and behold they were all dead corpses

3737 And Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians went out and departed
and returned and dwelt in Ninive

3738 And it came to pass as he was worshipping in the temple of
Nesroch his god that Adramelech and Sarasar his sons slew him with the
sword and they fled into the land of Ararat and Asarhaddon his son
reigned in his stead



Isaias Chapter 38


Ezechias being advertised that he shall die obtains by prayer a
prolongation of his life in confirmation of which the sun goes back
The canticle of Ezechias

381 In those days Ezechias was sick even to death and Isaias the son
of Amos the prophet cane unto him and said to him Thus saith the
Lord Take order with thy house for thou shalt die and not live

382 And Ezechias turned his face toward the wall and prayed to the
Lord

383 And said I beseech thee O Lord remember how I have walked
before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that
which is good in thy sight And Ezechias wept with great weeping

384 And the word of the Lord came to Isaias saying

385 Go and say to Ezechias Thus saith the Lord the God of David thy
father I have heard thy prayer and I have seen thy tears behold I
will add to thy days fifteen years

386 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king
of the Assyrians and I will protect it

387 And this shall be a sign to thee from the Lord that the Lord
will do this word which he hath spoken

388 Behold I will bring again the shadow of the lines by which it is
now gone down in the sun dial of Achaz with the sun ten lines
backward And the sun returned ten lines by the degrees by which it was
gone down

389 The writing of Ezechias king of Juda when he had been sick and
was recovered of his sickness

3810 I said In the midst of my days I shall go to the gates of hell
I sought for the residue of my years

Hell  Sheol or Hades the region of the dead

3811 I said I shall not see the Lord God in the land of the living
I shall behold man no more nor the inhabitant of rest

3812 My generation is at an end and it is rolled away from me as a
shepherds tent My life is cut off as by a weaver whilst I was yet
but beginning he cut me off from morning even to night thou wilt make
an end of me

3813 I hoped till morning as a lion so hath he broken all my bones
from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me

3814 I will cry like a young swallow I will meditate like a dove my
eyes are weakened looking upward Lord I suffer violence answer thou
for me

3815 What shall I say or what shall he answer for me whereas he
himself hath done it I will recount to thee all my years in the
bitterness of my soul

3816 O Lord if mans life be such and the life of my spirit be in
such things as these thou shalt correct me and make me to live

3817 Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter but thou hast
delivered my soul that it should not perish thou hast cast all my sins
behind thy back

3818 For hell shall not confess to thee neither shall death praise
thee nor shall they that go down into the pit look for thy truth

3819 The living the living he shall give praise to thee as I do
this day the father shall make the truth known to the children

3820 O Lord save me and we will sing our psalms all the days of our
life in the house of the Lord

3821 Now Isaias had ordered that they should take a lump of figs and
lay it as a plaster upon the wound and that he should be healed

3822 And Ezechias had said What shall be the sign that I shall go up
to the house of the Lord



Isaias Chapter 39


Ezechias shews all his treasures to the ambassadors of Babylon upon
which Isaias foretells the Babylonish captivity

391 At that time Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan king of
Babylon sent letters and presents to Ezechias for he had heard that
he had been sick and was recovered

392 And Ezechias rejoiced at their coming and he shewed them the
storehouses of his aromatical spices and of the silver and of the
gold and of the sweet odours and of the precious ointment and all
the storehouses of his furniture and all things that were found in his
treasures There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that
Ezechias shewed them not

393 Then Isaias the prophet came to king Ezechias and said to him
What said these men and from whence came they to thee And Ezechias
said From a far country they came to me from Babylon

394 And he said What saw they in thy house And Ezechias said All
things that are in my house have they seen there was not any thing
which I have not shewn them in my treasures

395 And Isaias said to Ezechias Hear the word of the Lord of hosts

396 Behold the days shall come that all that is in thy house and
that thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried
away into Babylon there shall not any thing be left saith the Lord

397 And of thy children that shall issue from thee whom thou shalt
beget they shall take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of
the king of Babylon

398 And Ezechias said to Isaias The word of the Lord which he hath
spoken is good And he said Only let peace and truth be in my days



Isaias Chapter 40


The prophet comforts the people with the promise of the coming of
Christ to forgive their sins Gods almighty power and majesty

401 Be comforted be comforted my people saith your God

402 Speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem and call to her for her evil
is come to an end her iniquity is forgiven she hath received of the
hand of the Lord double for all her sins

403 The voice of one crying in the desert Prepare ye the way of the
Lord make straight in the wilderness the paths of our God

404 Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall
be made low and the crooked shall become straight and the rough ways
plain

405 And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh
together shall see that the mouth of the Lord hath spoken

406 The voice of one saying Cry And I said What shall I cry
All flesh is grass and all the glory thereof as the flower of the field

407 The grass is withered and the flower is fallen because the
spirit of the Lord hath blown upon it Indeed the people is grass

408 The grass is withered and the flower is fallen but the word of
our Lord endureth for ever

409 Get thee up upon a high mountain thou that bringest good tidings
to Sion lift up thy voice with strength thou that bringest good
tidings to Jerusalem lift it up fear not Say to the cities of Juda
Behold your God

4010 Behold the Lord God shall come with strength and his arm shall
rule Behold his reward is with him and his work is before him

4011 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather
together the lambs with his arm and shall take them up in his bosom
and he himself shall carry them that are with young

4012 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and
weighed the heavens with his palm who hath poised with three fingers
the bulk of the earth and weighed the mountains in scales and the
hills in a balance

4013 Who hath forwarded the spirit of the Lord or who hath been his
counsellor and hath taught him

4014 With whom hath he consulted and who hath instructed him and
taught him the path of justice and taught him knowledge and shewed
him the way of understanding

4015 Behold the Gentiles are as a drop of a bucket and are counted
as the smallest grain of a balance behold the islands are as a little
dust

4016 And Libanus shall not be enough to burn nor the beasts thereof
sufficient for a burnt offering

4017 All nations are before him as if they had no being at all and
are counted to him as nothing and vanity

4018 To whom then have you likened God or what image will you make
for him

4019 Hath the workman cast a graven statue or hath the goldsmith
formed it with gold or the silversmith with plates of silver

4020 He hath chosen strong wood and that will not rot the skilful
workman seeketh how he may set up an idol that may not be moved

4021 Do you not know hath it not been heard hath it not been told
you from the beginning have you not understood the foundations of the
earth

4022 It is he that sitteth upon the globe of the earth and the
inhabitants thereof are as locusts he that stretcheth out the heavens
as nothing and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in

4023 He that bringeth the searchers of secrets to nothing that hath
made the judges of the earth as vanity

4024 And surely their stock was neither planted nor sown nor rooted
in the earth suddenly he hath blown upon them and they are withered
and a whirlwind shall take them away as stubble

4025 And to whom have ye likened me or made me equal saith the Holy
One

4026 Lift up your eyes on high and see who hath created these
things who bringeth out their host by number and calleth them all by
their names by the greatness of his might and strength and power
not one of them was missing

4027 Why sayest thou O Jacob and speakest O Israel My way is hid
from the Lord and my judgment is passed over from my God

4028 Knowest thou not or hast thou not heard the Lord is the
everlasting God who hath created the ends of the earth he shall not
faint nor labour neither is there any searching out of his wisdom

4029 It is he that giveth strength to the weary and increaseth force
and might to them that are not

4030 You shall faint and labour and young men shall fall by
infirmity

4031 But they that hope in the Lord shall renew their strength they
shall take wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall
walk and not faint



Isaias Chapter 41


The reign of the just one the vanity of idols

411 Let the islands keep silence before me and the nations take new
strength let them come near and then speak let us come near to
judgment together

412 Who hath raised up the just one from the east hath called him to
follow him he shall give the nations in his sight and he shall rule
over kings he shall give them as the dust to his sword as stubble
driven by the wind to his bow

413 He shall pursue them he shall pass in peace no path shall
appear after his feet

414 Who hath wrought and done these things calling the generations
from the beginning I the Lord I am the first and the last

415 The islands saw it and feared the ends of the earth were
astonished they drew near and came

416 Every one shall help his neighbour and shall say to his brother
Be of good courage

417 The coppersmith striking with the hammer encouraged him that
forged at that time saying It is ready for soldering and he
strengthened it with nails that it should not be moved

418 But thou Israel art my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the
seed of Abraham my friend

419 In whom I have taken thee from the ends of the earth and from
the remote parts thereof have called thee and said to thee Thou art
my servant I have chosen thee and have not cast thee away

4110 Fear not for I am with thee turn not aside for I am thy God
I have strengthened thee and have helped thee and the right hand of
my just one hath upheld thee

4111 Behold all that fight against thee shall be confounded and
ashamed they shall be as nothing and the men shall perish that strive
against thee

4112 Thou shalt seek them and shalt not find the men that resist
thee they shall be as nothing and as a thing consumed the men that
war against thee

4113 For I am the Lord thy God who take thee by the hand and say to
thee Fear not I have helped thee

4114 Fear not thou worm of Jacob you that are dead of Israel I
have helped thee saith the Lord and thy Redeemer the Holy One of
Israel

4115 I have made thee as a new thrashing wain with teeth like a saw
thou shalt thrash the mountains and break them in pieces and shalt
make the hills as chaff

4116 Thou shalt fan them and the wind shall carry them away and the
whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord in
the Holy One of Israel thou shalt be joyful

4117 The needy and the poor seek for waters and there are none
their tongue hath been dry with thirst I the Lord will hear them I
the God of Israel will not forsake them

4118 I will open rivers in the high hills and fountains in the midst
of the plains I will turn the desert into pools of waters and the
impassable land into streams of waters

4119 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the thorn and the
myrtle and the olive tree I will set in the desert the fir tree the
elm and the box tree together

The thorn  In Hebrew the shitta or setim a tree resembling the
white thorn

4120 That they may see and know and consider and understand
together that the hand of the Lord hath done this and the Holy One of
Israel hath created it

4121 Bring your cause near saith the Lord bring hither if you have
any thing to allege saith the King of Jacob

4122 Let them come and tell us all things that are to come tell us
the former things what they were and we will set our heart upon them
and shall know the latter end of them and tell us the things that are
to come

4123 Shew the things that are to come hereafter and we shall know
that ye are gods Do ye also good or evil if you can and let us
speak and see together

4124 Behold you are of nothing and your work of that which hath no
being he that hath chosen you is an abomination

4125 I have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the
rising of the sun he shall call upon my name and he shall make
princes to be as dirt and as the potter treading clay

4126 Who hath declared from the beginning that we may know and from
time of old that we may say Thou art just There is none that
sheweth nor that foretelleth nor that heareth your words

4127 The first shall say to Sion Behold they are here and to
Jerusalem I will give an evangelist

4128 And I saw and there was no one even among them to consult or
who when I asked could answer a word

4129 Behold they are all in the wrong and their works are vain
their idols are wind and vanity



Isaias Chapter 42


The office of Christ The preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles The
blindness and reprobation of the Jews

421 Behold my servant I will uphold him my elect my soul
delighteth in him I have given my spirit upon him he shall bring
forth judgment to the Gentiles

My servant  Christ who according to his humanity is the servant of
God

422 He shall not cry nor have respect to person neither shall his
voice be heard abroad

423 The bruised reed he shall not break and smoking flax he shall
not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth

424 He shall not be sad nor troublesome till he set judgment in the
earth and the islands shall wait for his law

425 Thus saith the Lord God that created the heavens and stretched
them out that established the earth and the things that spring out of
it that giveth breath to the people upon it and spirit to them that
tread thereon

426 I the Lord have called thee in justice and taken thee by the
hand and preserved thee And I have given thee for a covenant of the
people for a light of the Gentiles

427 That thou mightest open the eyes of the blind and bring forth
the prisoner out of prison and them that sit in darkness out of the
prison house

428 I the Lord this is my name I will not give my glory to another
nor my praise to graven things

429 The things that were first behold they are come and new things
do I declare before they spring forth I will make you hear them

4210 Sing ye to the Lord a new song his praise is from the ends of
the earth you that go down to the sea and all that are therein ye
islands and ye inhabitants of them

4211 Let the desert and the cities thereof be exalted Cedar shall
dwell in houses ye inhabitants of Petra give praise they shall cry
from the top of the mountains

Petra  A city that gives name to Arabia Petraea

4212 They shall give glory to the Lord and shall declare his praise
in the islands

4213 The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man as a man of war shall
he stir up zeal he shall shout and cry he shall prevail against his
enemies

4214 I have always held my peace I have kept silence I have been
patient I will speak now as a woman in labour I will destroy and
swallow up at once

4215 I will lay waste the mountains and hills and will make all
their grass to wither and I will turn rivers into islands and will
dry up the standing pools

4216 And I will lead the blind into the way which they know not and
in the paths which they were ignorant of I will make them walk I will
make darkness light before them and crooked things straight these
things have I done to them and have not forsaken them

4217 They are turned back let them be greatly confounded that trust
in a graven thing that say to a molten thing You are our god

4218 Hear ye deaf and ye blind behold that you may see

4219 Who is blind but my servant or deaf but he to whom I have
sent my messengers Who is blind but he that is sold or who is blind
but the servant of the Lord

4220 Thou that seest many things wilt thou not observe them thou
that hast ears open wilt thou not hear

4221 And the Lord was willing to sanctify him and to magnify the
law and exalt it

4222 But this is a people that is robbed and wasted they are all the
snare of young men and they are hid in the houses of prisons they are
made a prey and there is none to deliver them a spoil and there is
none that saith Restore

4223 Who is there among you that will give ear to this that will
attend and hearken for times to come

4224 Who hath given Jacob for a spoil and Israel to robbers hath
not the Lord himself against whom we have sinned And they would not
walk in his ways and they have not hearkened to his law

4225 And he hath poured out upon him the indignation of his fury and
a strong battle and hath burnt him round about and he knew not and
set him on fire and he understood not



Isaias Chapter 43


God comforts his church promising to protect her for ever he
expostulates with the Jews for their ingratitude

431 And now thus saith the Lord that created thee O Jacob and
formed thee O Israel Fear not for I have redeemed thee and called
thee by thy name thou art mine

432 When thou shalt pass through the waters I will be with thee and
the rivers shall not cover thee when thou shalt walk in the fire thou
shalt not be burnt and the flames shall not burn in thee

433 For I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Saviour I
have given Egypt for thy atonement Ethiopia and Saba for thee

434 Since thou becamest honourable in my eyes thou art glorious I
have loved thee and I will give men for thee and people for thy life

435 Fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the
east and gather thee from the west

436 I will say to the north Give up and to the south Keep not
back bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the
earth

437 And every one that calleth upon my name I have created him for
my glory I have formed him and made him

438 Bring forth the people that are blind and have eyes that are
deaf and have ears

439 All the nations are assembled together and the tribes are
gathered who among you can declare this and shall make us hear the
former things let them bring forth their witnesses let them be
justified and hear and say It is truth

4310 You are my witnesses saith the Lord and my servant whom I have
chosen that you may know and believe me and understand that I myself
am Before me there was no God formed and after me there shall be
none

4311 I am I am the Lord and there is no saviour besides me

4312 I have declared and have saved I have made it heard and there
was no strange one among you You are my witnesses saith the Lord and
I am God

4313 And from the beginning I am the same and there is none that can
deliver out of my hind I will work and who shall turn it away

4314 Thus saith the Lord your redeemer the Holy One of Israel For
your sake I sent to Babylon and have brought down all their bars and
the Chaldeans glorying in their ships

4315 I am the Lord your Holy One the Creator of Israel your King

4316 Thus saith the Lord who made a way in the sea and a path in
the mighty waters

4317 Who brought forth the chariot and the horse the army and the
strong they lay down to sleep together and they shall not rise again
they are broken as flax and are extinct

4318 Remember not former things and look not on things of old

4319 Behold I do new things and now they shall spring forth verily
you shall know them I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in
the desert

4320 The beast of the field shall glorify me the dragons and the
ostriches because I have given waters in the wilderness rivers in the
desert to give drink to my people to my chosen

4321 This people have I formed for myself they shall shew forth my
praise

4322 But thou hast not called upon me O Jacob neither hast thou
laboured about me O Israel

4323 Thou hast not offered me the ram of thy holocaust nor hast thou
glorified me with thy victims I have not caused thee to serve with
oblations nor wearied thee with incense

4324 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou
filled me with the fat of thy victims But thou hast made me to serve
with thy sins thou hast wearied me with thy iniquities

4325 I am I am he that blot out thy iniquities for my own sake and
I will not remember thy sins

4326 Put me in remembrance and let us plead together tell if thou
hast any thing to justify thyself

4327 Thy first father sinned and thy teachers have transgressed
against me

4328 And I have profaned the holy princes I have given Jacob to
slaughter and Israel to reproach



Isaias Chapter 44


Gods favour to his church The folly of idolatry The people shall be
delivered from captivity

441 And now hear O Jacob my servant and Israel whom I have chosen

442 Thus saith the Lord that made and formed thee thy helper from
the womb Fear not O my servant Jacob and thou most righteous whom I
have chosen

443 For I will pour out waters upon the thirsty ground and streams
upon the dry land I will pour out my spirit upon thy seed and my
blessing upon thy stock

444 And they shall spring up among the herbs as willows beside the
running waters

445 One shall say I am the Lords and another shall call himself by
the name of Jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand To the
Lord and surname himself by the name of Israel

446 Thus saith the Lord the king of Israel and his redeemer the Lord
of hosts I am the first and I am the last and besides me there is no
God

447 Who is like to me let him call and declare and let him set
before me the order since I appointed the ancient people and the
things to come and that shall be hereafter let them shew unto them

448 Fear ye not neither be ye troubled from that time I have made
thee to hear and have declared you are my witnesses Is there a God
besides me a maker whom I have not known

449 The makers of idols are all of them nothing and their best
beloved things shall not profit them They are their witnesses that
they do not see nor understand that they may be ashamed

4410 Who hath formed a god and made a graven thing that is
profitable for nothing

4411 Behold all the partakers thereof shall be confounded for the
makers are men they shall all assemble together they shall stand and
fear and shall be confounded together

4412 The smith hath wrought with his file with coals and with
hammers he hath formed it and hath wrought with the strength of his
arm he shall hunger and faint he shall drink no water and shall be
weary

4413 The carpenter hath stretched out his rule he hath formed it
with a plane he hath made it with corners and hath fashioned it round
with the compass and he hath made the image of a man as it were a
beautiful man dwelling in a house

4414 He hath cut down cedars taken the holm and the oak that stood
among the trees of the forest he hath planted the pine tree which the
rain hath nourished

4415 And it hath served men for fuel he took thereof and warmed
himself and he kindled it and baked bread but of the rest he made a
god and adored it he made a graven thing and bowed down before it

4416 Part of it he burnt with fire and with part of it he dressed
his meat he boiled pottage and was filled and was warmed and said
Aha I am warm I have seen the fire

4417 But the residue thereof he made a god and a graven thing for
himself he boweth down before it and adoreth it and prayeth unto it
saying Deliver me for thou art my God

4418 They have not known nor understood for their eyes are covered
that they may not see and that they may not understand with their
heart

4419 They do not consider in their mind nor know nor have the
thought to say I have burnt part of it in the fire and I have baked
bread upon the coals thereof I have broiled flesh and have eaten and
of the residue thereof shall I make an idol shall I fall down before
the stock of a tree

4420 Part thereof is ashes his foolish heart adoreth it and he will
not save his soul nor say Perhaps there is a lie in my right hand

4421 Remember these things O Jacob and Israel for thou art my
servant I have formed thee thou art my servant O Israel forget me
not

4422 I have blotted out thy iniquities as a cloud and thy sins as a
mist return to me for I have redeemed thee

4423 Give praise O ye heavens for the Lord hath shewn mercy shout
with joy ye ends of the earth ye mountains resound with praise
thou O forest and every tree therein for the Lord hath redeemed
Jacob and Israel shall be glorified

4424 Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer and thy maker from the womb
I am the Lord that make all things that alone stretch out the
heavens that established the earth and there is none with me

4425 That make void the tokens of diviners and make the soothsayers
mad That turn the wise backward and that make their knowledge
foolish

4426 That raise up the word of my servant and perform the counsel of
my messengers who say to Jerusalem Thou shalt be inhabited and to
the cities of Juda You shall be built and I will raise up the wastes
thereof

4427 Who say to the deep Be thou desolate and I will dry up thy
rivers

4428 Who say to Cyrus Thou art my shepherd and thou shalt perform
all my pleasure Who say to Jerusalem Thou shalt be built and to the
temple Thy foundations shall be laid



Isaias Chapter 45


A prophecy of Cyrus as a figure of Christ the great deliverer of
Gods people

451 Thus saith the Lord to my anointed Cyrus whose right hand I have
taken hold of to subdue nations before his face and to turn the backs
of kings and to open the doors before him and the gates shall not be
shut

452 I will go before thee and will humble the great ones of the
earth I will break in pieces the gates of brass and will burst the
bars of iron

453 And I will give thee hidden treasures and the concealed riches
of secret places that thou mayest know that I am the Lord who call
thee by thy name the God of Israel

454 For the sake of my servant Jacob and Israel my elect I have
even called thee by thy name I have made a likeness of thee and thou
hast not known me

455 I am the Lord and there is none else there is no God besides
me I girded thee and thou hast not known me

456 That they may know who are from the rising of the sun and they
who are from the west that there is none besides me I am the Lord
and there is none else

457 I form the light and create darkness I make peace and create
evil I the Lord that do all these things

Create evil etc  The evils of afflictions and punishments but not
the evil of sin

458 Drop down dew ye heavens from above and let the clouds rain
the just let the earth be opened and bud forth a saviour and let
justice spring up together I the Lord have created him

459 Woe to him that gainsayeth his maker a sherd of the earthen
pots shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it What art thou
making and thy work is without hands

4510 Woe to him that saith to his father Why begettest thou and to
the woman Why dost thou bring forth

4511 Thus saith the Lord the Holy One of Israel his maker Ask me of
things to come concerning my children and concerning the work of my
hands give ye charge to me

4512 I made the earth and I created man upon it my hand stretched
forth the heavens and I have commanded all their host

4513 I have raised him up to justice and I will direct all his ways
he shall build my city and let go my captives not for ransom nor for
presents saith the Lord the God of hosts

4514 Thus saith the Lord The labour of Egypt and the merchandise of
Ethiopia and of Sabaim men of stature shall come over to thee and
shall be thine they shall walk after thee they shall go bound with
manacles and they shall worship thee and shall make supplication to
thee only in thee is God and there is no God besides thee

4515 Verily thou art a hidden God the God of Israel the saviour

4516 They are all confounded and ashamed the forgers of errors are
gone together into confusion

4517 Israel is saved in the Lord with an eternal salvation you shall
not be confounded and you shall not be ashamed for ever and ever

4518 For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens God himself
that formed the earth and made it the very maker thereof he did not
create it in vain he formed it to be inhabited I am the Lord and
there is no other

4519 I have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth I
have not said to the seed of Jacob Seek me in vain I am the Lord that
speak justice that declare right things

4520 Assemble yourselves and come and draw near together ye that
are saved of the Gentiles they have no knowledge that set up the wood
of their graven work and pray to a god that cannot save

4521 Tell ye and come and consult together who hath declared this
from the beginning who hath foretold this from that time Have not I
the Lord and there is no God else besides me A just God and a
saviour there is none besides me

4522 Be converted to me and you shall be saved all ye ends of the
earth for I am God and there is no other

4523 I have sworn by myself the word of justice shall go out of my
mouth and shall not return

4524 For every knee shall be bowed to me and every tongue shall
swear

4525 Therefore shall he say In the Lord are my justices and empire
they shall come to him and all that resist him shall be confounded

4526 In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified and
praised



Isaias Chapter 46


The idols of Babylon shall be destroyed Salvation is promised through
Christ

461 Bel is broken Nebo is destroyed their idols are put upon beasts
and cattle your burdens of heavy weight even unto weariness

462 They are consumed and are broken together they could not save
him that carried them and they themselves shall go into captivity

463 Hearken unto me O house of Jacob all the remnant of the house
of Israel who are carried by my bowels are borne up by my womb

464 Even to your old age I am the same and to your grey hairs I will
carry you I have made you and I will bear I will carry and will
save

465 To whom have you likened me and made me equal and compared me
and made me like

466 You that contribute gold out of the bag and weigh out silver in
the scales and hire a goldsmith to make a god and they fall down and
worship

467 They bear him on their shoulders and carry him and set him in
his place and he shall stand and shall not stir out of his place
Yea when they shall cry also unto him he shall not hear he shall not
save them from tribulation

468 Remember this and be ashamed return ye transgressors to the
heart

469 Remember the former age for I am God and there is no God
beside neither is there the like to me

4610 Who shew from the beginning the things that shall be at last
and from ancient times the things that as yet are not done saying My
counsel shall stand and all my will shall be done

4611 Who call a bird from the east and from a far country the man of
my own will and I have spoken and will bring it to pass I have
created and I will do it Hear me O ye hardhearted who are far from
justice

4612 I have brought my justice near it shall not be afar off and my
salvation shall not tarry I will give salvation in Sion and my glory
in Israel



Isaias Chapter 47


Gods judgment upon Babylon

471 Come down sit in the dust O virgin daughter of Babylon sit on
the ground there is no throne for the daughter of the Chaldeans for
thou shalt no more be called delicate and tender

472 Take a millstone and grind meal uncover thy shame strip thy
shoulder make bare thy legs pass over the rivers

473 Thy nakedness shall be discovered and thy shame shall be seen I
will take vengeance and no man shall resist me

474 Our redeemer the Lord of hosts is his name the Holy One of
Israel

475 Sit thou silent and get thee into darkness O daughter of the
Chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms

476 I was angry with my people I have polluted my inheritance and
have given them into thy hand thou hast shewn no mercy to them upon
the ancient thou hast laid thy yoke exceeding heavy

477 And thou hast said I shall be a lady for ever thou hast not
laid these things to thy heart neither hast thou remembered thy latter
end

478 And now hear these things thou that art delicate and dwellest
confidently that sayest in thy heart I am and there is none else
besides me I shall not sit as a widow and I shall not know
barrenness

479 These two things shall come upon thee suddenly in one day
barrenness and widowhood All things are come upon thee because of the
multitude of thy sorceries and for the great hardness of thy
enchanters

4710 And thou hast trusted in thy wickedness and hast said There is
none that seeth me Thy wisdom and thy knowledge this hath deceived
thee And thou hast said in thy heart I am and besides me there is no
other

4711 Evil shall come upon thee and thou shalt not know the rising
thereof and calamity shall fall violently upon thee which thou canst
not keep off misery shall come upon thee suddenly which thou shalt
not know

4712 Stand now with thy enchanters and with the multitude of thy
sorceries in which thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be it may
profit thee any thing or if thou mayst become stronger

4713 Thou hast failed in the multitude of thy counsels let now the
astrologers stand and save thee they that gazed at the stars and
counted the months that from them they might tell the things that
shall come to thee

4714 Behold they are as stubble fire hath burnt them they shall not
deliver themselves from the power of the flames there are no coals
wherewith they may be warmed nor fire that they may sit thereat

4715 Such are all the things become to thee in which thou hast
laboured thy merchants from thy youth every one hath erred in his own
way there is none that can save thee



Isaias Chapter 48


He reproaches the Jews for their obstinacy he will deliver them out of
their captivity for his own names sake

481 Hear ye these things O house of Jacob you that are called by
the name of Israel and are come forth out of the waters of Juda you
who swear by the name of the Lord and make mention of the God of
Israel but not in truth nor in justice

482 For they are called of the holy city and are established upon
the God of Israel the Lord of hosts is his name

483 The former things of old I have declared and they went forth
out of my mouth and I have made them to be heard I did them suddenly
and they came to pass

484 For I knew that thou art stubborn and thy neck is as an iron
sinew and thy forehead as brass

485 I foretold thee of old before they came to pass I told thee
lest thou shouldst say My idols have done these things and my graven
and molten things have commanded them

486 See now all the things which thou hast heard but have you
declared them I have shewn thee new things from that time and things
are kept which thou knowest not

487 They are created now and not of old and before the day when
thou heardest them not lest thou shouldst say Behold I knew them

488 Thou hast neither heard nor known neither was thy ear opened of
old For I know that transgressing thou wilt transgress and I have
called thee a transgressor from the womb

489 For my names sake I will remove my wrath far off and for my
praise I will bridle thee lest thou shouldst perish

4810 Behold I have refined thee but not as silver I have chosen
thee in the furnace of poverty

4811 For my own sake for my own sake will I do it that I may not be
blasphemed and I will not give my glory to another

4812 Hearken to me O Jacob and thou Israel whom I call I am he I
am the first and I am the last

4813 My hand also hath founded the earth and my right hand hath
measured the heavens I shall call them and they shall stand together

4814 Assemble yourselves together all you and hear who among them
hath declared these things the Lord hath loved him he will do his
pleasure in Babylon and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans

4815 I even I have spoken and called him I have brought him and
his way is made prosperous

4816 Come ye near unto me and hear this I have not spoken in secret
from the beginning from the time before it was done I was there and
now the Lord God hath sent me and his spirit

4817 Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer the Holy One of Israel I am
the Lord thy God that teach thee profitable things that govern thee in
the way that thou walkest

4818 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments thy peace had
been as a river and thy justice as the waves of the sea

4819 And thy seed had been as the sand and the offspring of thy
bowels like the gravel thereof his name should not have perished nor
have been destroyed from before my face

4820 Come forth out of Babylon flee ye from the Chaldeans declare
it with the voice of joy make this to be heard and speak it out even
to the ends of the earth Say The Lord hath redeemed his servant
Jacob

4821 They thirsted not in the desert when he led them out he
brought forth water out of the rock for them and he clove the rock
and the waters gushed out

4822 There is no peace to the wicked saith the Lord



Isaias Chapter 49


Christ shall bring the Gentiles to salvation Gods love to his church
is perpetual

491 Give ear ye islands and hearken ye people from afar The Lord
hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother he hath been
mindful of my name

492 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of
his hand he hath protected me and hath made me as a chosen arrow in
his quiver he hath hidden me

493 And he said to me Thou art my servant Israel for in thee will I
glory

494 And I said I have laboured in vain I have spent my strength
without cause and in vain therefore my judgment is with the Lord and
my work with my God

495 And now saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his
servant that I may bring back Jacob unto him and Israel will not be
gathered together and I am glorified in the eyes of the Lord and my
God is made my strength

496 And he said It is a small thing that thou shouldst be my servant
to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to convert the dregs of Israel
Behold I have given thee to be the light of the Gentiles that thou
mayst be my salvation even to the farthest part of the earth

497 Thus saith the Lord the redeemer of Israel his Holy One to the
soul that is despised to the nation that is abhorred to the servant
of rulers Kings shall see and princes shall rise up and adore for
the Lords sake because he is faithful and for the Holy One of
Israel who hath chosen thee

498 Thus saith the Lord In an acceptable time I have heard thee and
in the day of salvation I have helped thee and I have preserved thee
and given thee to be a covenant of the people that thou mightest raise
up the earth and possess the inheritances that were destroyed

499 That thou mightest say to them that are bound Come forth and to
them that are in darkness Shew yourselves They shall feed in the
ways and their pastures shall be in every plain

4910 They shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor
the sun strike them for he that is merciful to them shall be their
shepherd and at the fountains of waters he shall give them drink

4911 And I will make all my mountains a way and my paths shall be
exalted

4912 Behold these shall come from afar and behold these from the
north and from the sea and these from the south country

4913 Give praise O ye heavens and rejoice O earth ye mountains
give praise with jubilation because the Lord hath comforted his
people and will have mercy on his poor ones

4914 And Sion said The Lord hath forsaken me and the Lord hath
forgotten me

4915 Can a woman forget her infant so as not to have pity on the son
of her womb and if she should forget yet will not I forget thee

4916 Behold I have graven thee in my hands thy walls are always
before my eyes

4917 Thy builders are come they that destroy thee and make thee
waste shall go out of thee

4918 Lift up thy eyes round about and see all these are gathered
together they are come to thee I live saith the Lord thou shalt be
clothed with all these as with an ornament and as a bride thou shalt
put them about thee

4919 For thy deserts and thy desolate places and the land of thy
destruction shall now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants and
they that swallowed thee up shall be chased far away

4920 The children of thy barrenness shall still say in thy ears The
place is too strait for me make me room to dwell in

4921 And thou shalt say in thy heart Who hath begotten these I was
barren and brought not forth led away and captive and who hath
brought up these I was destitute and alone and these where were
they

4922 Thus saith the Lord God Behold I will lift up my hand to the
Gentiles and will set up my standard to the people And they shall
bring thy sons in their arms and carry thy daughters upon their
shoulders

4923 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers and queens thy nurses
they shall worship thee with their face toward the earth and they
shall lick up the dust of thy feet And thou shalt know that I am the
Lord for they shall not be confounded that wait for him

4924 Shall the prey be taken from the strong or can that which was
taken by the mighty be delivered

4925 For thus saith the Lord Yea verily even the captivity shall be
taken away from the strong and that which was taken by the mighty
shall be delivered But I will judge those that have judged thee and
thy children I will save

4926 And I will feed thy enemies with their own flesh and they shall
be made drunk with their own blood as with new wine and all flesh
shall know that I am the Lord that save thee and thy Redeemer the
Mighty One of Jacob



Isaias Chapter 50


The synagogue shall be divorced for her iniquities Christ for her sake
will endure ignominious afflictions

501 Thus saith the Lord What is this bill of the divorce of your
mother with which I have put her away or who is my creditor to whom
I sold you behold you are sold for your iniquities and for your
wicked deeds have I put your mother away

502 Because I came and there was not a man I called and there was
none that would hear Is my hand shortened and become little that I
cannot redeem or is there no strength in me to deliver Behold at my
rebuke I will make the sea a desert I will turn the rivers into dry
land the fishes shall rot for want of water and shall die for thirst

503 I will clothe the heavens with darkness and will make sackcloth
their covering

504 The Lord hath given me a learned tongue that I should know how
to uphold by word him that is weary he wakeneth in the morning in the
morning he wakeneth my ear that I may hear him as a master

505 The Lord God hath opened my ear and I do not resist I have not
gone back

506 I have given my body to the strikers and my cheeks to them that
plucked them I have not turned away my face from them that rebuked me
and spit upon me

507 The Lord God is my helper therefore am I not confounded
therefore have I set my face as a most hard rock and I know that I
shall not be confounded

508 He is near that justifieth me who will contend with me let us
stand together who is my adversary let him come near to me

509 Behold the Lord God is my helper who is he that shall condemn
me Lo they shall all be destroyed as a garment the moth shall eat
them up

5010 Who is there among you that feareth the Lord that heareth the
voice of his servant that hath walked in darkness and hath no light
let him hope in the name of the Lord and lean upon his God

5011 Behold all you that kindle a fire encompassed with flames walk
in the light of your fire and in the flames which you have kindled
this is done to you by my hand you shall sleep in sorrows



Isaias Chapter 51


An exhortation to trust in Christ He shall protect the children of his
church

511 Give ear to me you that follow that which is just and you that
seek the Lord look unto the rock whence you are hewn and to the hole
of the pit from which you are dug out

512 Look unto Abraham your father and to Sara that bore you for I
called him alone and blessed him and multiplied him

513 The Lord therefore will comfort Sion and will comfort all the
ruins thereof and he will make her desert as a place of pleasure and
her wilderness as the garden of the Lord Joy and gladness shall be
found therein thanksgiving and the voice of praise

514 Hearken unto me O my people and give ear to me O my tribes
for a law shall go forth from me and my judgment shall rest to be a
light of the nations

515 My just one is near at hand my saviour is gone forth and my
arms shall judge the people the islands shall look for me and shall
patiently wait for my arm

516 Lift up your eyes to heaven and look down to the earth beneath
for the heavens shall vanish like smoke and the earth shall be worn
away like a garment and the inhabitants thereof shall perish in like
manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my justice shall not
fail

517 Hearken to me you that know what is just my people who have my
law in your heart fear ye not the reproach of men and be not afraid
of their blasphemies

518 For the worm shall eat them up as a garment and the moth shall
consume them as wool but my salvation shall be for ever and my
justice from generation to generation

519 Arise arise put on strength O thou arm of the Lord arise as
in the days of old in the ancient generations Hast not thou struck
the proud one and wounded the dragon

5110 Hast not thou dried up the sea the water of the mighty deep
who madest the depth of the sea a way that the delivered might pass
over

5111 And now they that are redeemed by the Lord shall return and
shall come into Sion singing praises and joy everlasting shall be upon
their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness sorrow and mourning
shall flee away

5112 I myself will comfort you who art thou that thou shouldst be
afraid of a mortal man and of the son of man who shall wither away
like grass

5113 And thou hast forgotten the Lord thy maker who stretched out
the heavens and founded the earth and thou hast been afraid
continually all the day at the presence of his fury who afflicted thee
and had prepared himself to destroy thee where is now the fury of the
oppressor

5114 He shall quickly come that is going to open unto you and he
shall not kill unto utter destruction neither shall his bread fail

5115 But I am the Lord thy God who trouble the sea and the waves
thereof swell the Lord of hosts is my name

5116 I have put my words in thy mouth and have protected thee in the
shadow of my hand that thou mightest plant the heavens and found the
earth and mightest say to Sion Thou art my people

5117 Arise arise stand up O Jerusalem which hast drunk at the
hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath thou hast drunk even to the
bottom of the cup of dead sleep and thou hast drunk even to the dregs

5118 There is none that can uphold her among all the children that
she hath brought forth and there is none that taketh her by the hand
among all the children that she hath brought up

5119 There are two things that have happened to thee who shall be
sorry for thee desolation and destruction and the famine and the
sword who shall comfort thee

5120 Thy children are cast forth they have slept at the head of all
the ways and the wild ox that is snared full of the indignation of
the Lord of the rebuke of thy God

5121 Therefore hear this thou poor little one and thou that art
drunk but not with wine

5122 Thus saith thy Sovereign the Lord and thy God who will fight
for his people Behold I have taken out of thy hand the cup of dead
sleep the dregs of the cup of my indignation thou shalt not drink it
again any more

5123 And I will put it in the hand of them that have oppressed thee
and have said to thy soul Bow down that we may go over and thou hast
laid thy body as the ground and as a way to them that went over



Isaias Chapter 52


Under the figure of the deliverance from the Babylonish captivity the
church is invited to rejoice for her redemption from sin Christs
kingdom shall be exalted

521 Arise arise put on thy strength O Sion put on the garments of
thy glory O Jerusalem the city of the Holy One for henceforth the
uncircumcised and unclean shall no more pass through thee

522 Shake thyself from the dust arise sit up O Jerusalem loose
the bonds from off thy neck O captive daughter of Sion

523 For thus saith the Lord You were sold gratis and you shall be
redeemed without money

524 For thus saith the Lord God My people went down into Egypt at
the beginning to sojourn there and the Assyrian hath oppressed them
without any cause at all

525 And now what have I here saith the Lord for my people is taken
away gratis They that rule over them treat them unjustly saith the
Lord and my name is continually blasphemed all the day long

526 Therefore my people shall know my name in that day for I myself
that spoke behold I am here

527 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
bringeth good tidings and that preacheth peace of him that sheweth
forth good that preacheth salvation that saith to Sion Thy God shall
reign

528 The voice of thy watchmen they have lifted up their voice they
shall praise together for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord
shall convert Sion

529 Rejoice and give praise together O ye deserts of Jerusalem for
the Lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed Jerusalem

5210 The Lord hath prepared his holy arm in the sight of all the
Gentiles and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our
God

5211 Depart depart go ye out from thence touch no unclean thing
go out of the midst of her be ye clean you that carry the vessels of
the Lord

5212 For you shall not go out in a tumult neither shall you make
haste by flight for the Lord will go before you and the God of Israel
will gather you together

5213 Behold my servant shall understand he shall be exalted and
extolled and shall be exceeding high

5214 As many have been astonished at thee so shall his visage be
inglorious among men and his form among the sons of men

5215 He shall sprinkle many nations kings shall shut their mouth at
him for they to whom it was not told of him have seen and they that
heard not have beheld



Isaias Chapter 53


A prophecy of the passion of Christ

531 Who a hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the
Lord revealed

532 And he shall grow up as a tender plant before him and as a root
out of a thirsty ground there is no beauty in him nor comeliness and
we have seen him and there was no sightliness that we should be
desirous of him

533 Despised and the most abject of men a man of sorrows and
acquainted with infirmity and his look was as it were hidden and
despised whereupon we esteemed him not

534 Surely he hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows and
we have thought him as it were a leper and as one struck by God and
afflicted

535 But he was wounded for our iniquities he was bruised for our
sins the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his bruises we
are healed

536 All we like sheep have gone astray every one hath turned aside
into his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all

537 He was offered because it was his own will and he opened not his
mouth he shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter and shall be dumb
as a lamb before his shearer and he shall not open his mouth

538 He was taken away from distress and from judgment who shall
declare his generation because he is cut off out of the land of the
living for the wickedness of my people have I struck him

539 And he shall give the ungodly for his burial and the rich for
his death because he hath done no iniquity neither was there deceit
in his mouth

5310 And the Lord was pleased to bruise him in infirmity if he shall
lay down his life for sin he shall see a longlived seed and the will
of the Lord shall be prosperous in his hand

5311 Because his soul hath laboured he shall see and be filled by
his knowledge shall this my just servant justify many and he shall
bear their iniquities

5312 Therefore will I distribute to him very many and he shall
divide the spoils of the strong because he hath delivered his soul
unto death and was reputed with the wicked and he hath borne the sins
of many and hath prayed for the transgressors



Isaias Chapter 54


The Gentiles who were barren before shall multiply in the church of
Christ from which Gods mercy shall never depart

541 Give praise O thou barren that bearest not sing forth praise
and make a joyful noise thou that didst not travail with child for
many are the children of the desolate more than of her that hath a
husband saith the Lord

542 Enlarge the place of thy tent and stretch out the skins of thy
tabernacles spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes

543 For thou shalt pass on to the right hand and to the left and
thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and shall inhabit the desolate
cities

544 Fear not for thou shalt not be confounded nor blush for thou
shalt not be put to shame because thou shalt forget the shame of thy
youth and shalt remember no more the reproach of thy widowhood

545 For he that made thee shall rule over thee the Lord of hosts is
his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel shall be called the
God of all the earth

546 For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and mourning in
spirit and as a wife cast off from her youth said thy God

547 For a small moment have I forsaken thee but with great mercies
will I gather thee

548 In a moment of indignation have I hid my face a little while from
thee but with everlasting kindness have I had mercy on thee said the
Lord thy Redeemer

549 This thing is to me as in the days of Noe to whom I swore that
I would no more bring in the waters of Noe upon the earth so have I
sworn not to be angry with thee and not to rebuke thee

5410 For the mountains shall be moved and the hills shall tremble
but my mercy shall not depart from thee and the covenant of my peace
shall not be moved said the Lord that hath mercy on thee

5411 O poor little one tossed with tempest without all comfort
behold I will lay thy stones in order and will lay thy foundations
with sapphires

5412 And I will make thy bulwarks of jasper and thy gates of graven
stones and all thy borders of desirable stones

5413 All thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be
the peace of thy children

5414 And thou shalt be founded in justice depart far from
oppression for thou shalt not fear and from terror for it shall not
come near thee

5415 Behold an inhabitant shall come who was not with me he that
was a stranger to thee before shall be joined to thee

5416 Behold I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
fire and bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created
the killer to destroy

5417 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every
tongue that resisteth thee in judgment thou shalt condemn This is the
inheritance of the servants of the Lord and their justice with me
saith the Lord



Isaias Chapter 55


God promises abundance of spiritual graces to the faithful that shall
believe in Christ out of all nations and sincerely serve him

551 All you that thirst come to the waters and you that have no
money make haste buy and eat come ye buy wine and milk without
money and without any price

552 Why do you spend money for that which is not bread and your
labour for that which doth not satisfy you Hearken diligently to me
and eat that which is good and your soul shall be delighted in
fatness

553 Incline your ear and come to me hear and your soul shall live
and I will make an everlasting covenant with you the faithful mercies
of David

554 Behold I have given him for a witness to the people for a leader
and a master to the Gentiles

555 Behold thou shalt call a nation which thou knewest not and the
nations that knew not thee shall run to thee because of the Lord thy
God and for the Holy One of Israel for he hath glorified thee

556 Seek ye the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he
is near

557 Let the wicked forsake his way and the unjust man his thoughts
and let him return to the Lord and he will have mercy on him and to
our God for he is bountiful to forgive

558 For my thoughts are not your thoughts nor your ways my ways
saith the Lord

559 For as the heavens are exalted above the earth so are my ways
exalted above your ways and my thoughts above your thoughts

5510 And as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and return
no more thither but soak the earth and water it and make it to
spring and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater

5511 So shall my word be which shall go forth from my mouth it
shall not return to me void but it shall do whatsoever I please and
shall prosper in the things for which I sent it

5512 For you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the
mountains and the hills shall sing praise before you and all the trees
of the country shall clap their hands

5513 Instead of the shrub shall come up the fir tree and instead of
the nettle shall come up the myrtle tree and the Lord shall be named
for an everlasting sign that shall not be taken away



Isaias Chapter 56


God invites all to keep his commandments the Gentiles that keep them
shall be the people of God the Jewish pastors are reproved

561 Thus saith the Lord Keep ye judgment and do justice for my
salvation is near to come and my justice to be revealed

562 Blessed is the man that doth this and the son of man that shall
lay hold on this that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it that
keepeth his hands from doing any evil

563 And let not the son of the stranger that adhereth to the Lord
speak saying The Lord will divide and separate me from his people
And let not the eunuch say Behold I am a dry tree

564 For thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs They that shall keep my
sabbaths and shall choose the things that please me and shall hold
fast my covenant

565 I will give to them in my house and within my walls a place
and a name better than sons and daughters I will give them an
everlasting name which shall never perish

566 And the children of the stranger that adhere to the Lord to
worship him and to love his name to be his servants every one that
keepeth the sabbath from profaning it and that holdeth fast my
covenant

567 I will bring them into my holy mount and will make them joyful
in my house of prayer their holocausts and their victims shall please
me upon my altar for my house shall be called the house of prayer for
all nations

568 The Lord God who gathereth the scattered of Israel saith I
will still gather unto him his congregation

569 All ye beasts of the field come to devour all ye beasts of the
forest

5610 His watchmen are all blind they are all ignorant dumb dogs not
able to bark seeing vain things sleeping and loving dreams

5611 And most impudent dogs they never had enough the shepherds
themselves knew no understanding all have turned aside into their own
way every one after his own gain from the first even to the last

5612 Come let us take wine and be filled with drunkenness and it
shall be as to day so also to morrow and much more



Isaias Chapter 57


The infidelity of the Jews their idolatry Promises to humble
penitents

571 The just perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and men of
mercy are taken away because there is none that understandeth for the
just man is taken away from before the face of evil

572 Let peace come let him rest in his bed that hath walked in his
uprightness

573 But draw near hither you sons of the sorceress the seed of the
adulterer and of the harlot

574 Upon whom have you jested upon whom have you opened your mouth
wide and put out your tongue are not you wicked children a false
seed

575 Who seek your comfort in idols under every green tree
sacrificing children in the torrents under the high rocks

576 In the parts of the torrent is thy portion this is thy lot and
thou hast poured out libations to them thou hast offered sacrifice
Shall I not be angry at these things

577 Upon a high and lofty mountain thou hast laid thy bed and hast
gone up thither to offer victims

578 And behind the door and behind the post thou hast set up thy
remembrance for thou hast discovered thyself near me and hast
received an adulterer thou hast enlarged thy bed and made a covenant
with them thou hast loved their bed with open hand

579 And thou hast adorned thyself for the king with ointment and
hast multiplied thy perfumes Thou hast sent thy messengers far off
and wast debased even to hell

5710 Thou hast been wearied in the multitude of thy ways yet thou
saidst not I will rest thou has found life of thy hand therefore
thou hast not asked

5711 For whom hast thou been solicitous and afraid that thou hast
lied and hast not been mindful of me nor thought on me in thy heart
for I am silent and as one that seeth not and thou hast forgotten me

5712 I will declare thy justice and thy works shall not profit thee

5713 When thou shalt cry let thy companies deliver thee but the
wind shall carry them all off a breeze shall take them away but he
that putteth his trust in me shall inherit the land and shall possess
my holy mount

5714 And I will say Make a way give free passage turn out of the
path take away the stumblingblocks out of the way of my people

5715 For thus saith the High and the Eminent that inhabiteth
eternity and his name is Holy who dwelleth in the high and holy
place and with a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of
the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite

5716 For I will not contend for ever neither will I be angry unto
the end because the spirit shall go forth from my face and breathings
I will make

5717 For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and I struck
him I hid my face from thee and was angry and he went away wandering
in his own heart

5718 I saw his ways and I healed him and brought him back and
restored comforts to him and to them that mourn for him

5719 I created the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far
off and to him that is near said the Lord and I healed him

5720 But the wicked are like the raging sea which cannot rest and
the waves thereof cast up dirt and mire

5721 There is no peace to the wicked saith the Lord God



Isaias Chapter 58


God rejects the hypocritical fasts of the Jews recommends works of
mercy and sincere godliness

581 Cry cease not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shew my
people their wicked doings and the house of Jacob their sins

582 For they seek me from day to day and desire to know my ways as
a nation that hath done justice and hath not forsaken the judgment of
their God they ask of me the judgments of justice they are willing to
approach to God

583 Why have we fasted and thou hast not regarded have we humbled
our souls and thou hast not taken notice Behold in the day of your
fast your own will is found and you exact of all your debtors

584 Behold you fast for debates and strife and strike with the fist
wickedly Do not fast as you have done until this day to make your cry
to be heard on high

585 Is this such a fast as I have chosen for a man to afflict his
soul for a day is this it to wind his head about like a circle and
to spread sackcloth and ashes wilt thou call this a fast and a day
acceptable to the Lord

586 Is not this rather the fast that I have chosen loose the bands
of wickedness undo the bundles that oppress let them that are broken
go free and break asunder every burden

587 Deal thy bread to the hungry and bring the needy and the
harbourless into thy house when thou shalt see one naked cover him
and despise not thy own flesh

588 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy health
shall speedily arise and thy justice shall go before thy face and the
glory of the Lord shall gather thee up

589 Then shalt thou call and the Lord shall hear thou shalt cry
and he shall say Here I am If thou wilt take away the chain out of
the midst of thee and cease to stretch out the finger and to speak
that which profiteth not

5810 When thou shalt pour out thy soul to the hungry and shalt
satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise up in darkness
and thy darkness shall be as the noonday

5811 And the Lord will give thee rest continually and will fill thy
soul with brightness and deliver thy bones and thou shalt be like a
watered garden and like a fountain of water whose waters shall not
fail

5812 And the places that have been desolate for ages shall be built
in thee thou shalt raise up the foundation of generation and
generation and thou shalt be called the repairer of the fences
turning the paths into rest

5813 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy own
will in my holy day and call the sabbath delightful and the holy of
the Lord glorious and glorify him while thou dost not thy own ways
and thy own will is not found to speak a word

5814 Then shalt thou be delighted in the Lord and I will lift thee
up above the high places of the earth and will feed thee with the
inheritance of Jacob thy father For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
it



Isaias Chapter 59


The dreadful evil of sin is displayed as the great obstacle to all
good from God yet he will send a Redeemer and make an everlasting
covenant with his church

591 Behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save
neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear

592 But your iniquities have divided between you and your God and
your sins have hid his face from you that he should not hear

593 For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with
iniquity your lips have spoken lies and your tongue uttereth
iniquity

594 There is none that calleth upon justice neither is there any one
that judgeth truly but they trust in a mere nothing and speak
vanities they have conceived labour and brought forth iniquity

595 They have broken the eggs of asps and have woven the webs of
spiders he that shall eat of their eggs shall die and that which is
brought out shall be hatched into a basilisk

596 Their webs shall not be for clothing neither shall they cover
themselves with their works their works are unprofitable works and
the work of iniquity is in their hands

597 Their feet run to evil and make haste to shed innocent blood
their thoughts are unprofitable thoughts wasting and destruction are
in their ways

598 They have not known the way of peace and there is no judgment in
their steps their paths are become crooked to them every one that
treadeth in them knoweth no peace

599 Therefore is judgment far from us and justice shall not overtake
us We looked for light and behold darkness brightness and we have
walked in the dark

5910 We have groped for the wall and like the blind we have groped
as if we had no eyes we have stumbled at noonday as in darkness we
are in dark places as dead men

5911 We shall roar all of us like bears and shall lament as mournful
doves We have looked for judgment and there is none for salvation
and it is far from us

5912 For our iniquities are multiplied before thee and our sins have
testified against us for our wicked doings are with us and have known
our iniquities

5913 In sinning and lying against the Lord and we have turned away
so that we went not after our God but spoke calumny and transgression
we have conceived and uttered from the heart words of falsehood

5914 And judgment is turned away backward and justice hath stood far
off because truth hath fallen down in the street and equity could not
come in

5915 And truth hath been forgotten and he that departed from evil
lay open to be a prey and the Lord saw and it appeared evil in his
eyes because there is no judgment

5916 And he saw that there is not a man and he stood astonished
because there is none to oppose himself and his own arm brought
salvation to him and his own justice supported him

5917 He put on justice as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation
upon his head he put on the garments of vengeance and was clad with
zeal as with a cloak

5918 As unto revenge as it were to repay wrath to his adversaries
and a reward to his enemies he will repay the like to the islands

5919 And they from the west shall fear the name of the Lord and
they from the rising of the sun his glory when he shall come as a
violent stream which the spirit of the Lord driveth on

5920 And there shall come a redeemer to Sion and to them that return
from iniquity in Jacob saith the Lord

5921 This is my covenant with them saith the Lord My spirit that is
in thee and my words that I have put in thy mouth shall not depart
out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the
mouth of thy seeds seed saith the Lord from henceforth and for ever

This is my covenant etc  Note here a clear promise of perpetual
orthodoxy to the church of Christ



Isaias Chapter 60


The light of true faith shall shine forth in the church of Christ and
shall be spread through all nations and continue for all ages

601 Arise be enlightened O Jerusalem for thy light is come and
the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee

602 For behold darkness shall cover the earth and a mist the people
but the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon
thee

603 And the Gentiles shall walk in thy light and kings in the
brightness of thy rising

604 Lift up thy eyes round about and see all these are gathered
together they are come to thee thy sons shall come from afar and thy
daughters shall rise up at thy side

605 Then shalt thou see and abound and thy heart shall wonder and
be enlarged when the multitude of the sea shall be converted to thee
the strength of the Gentiles shall come to thee

606 The multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of
Madian and Epha all they from Saba shall come bringing gold and
frankincense and shewing forth praise to the Lord

607 All the flocks of Cedar shall be gathered together unto thee the
rams of Nabaioth shall minister to thee they shall be offered upon my
acceptable altar and I will glorify the house of my majesty

608 Who are these that fly as clouds and as doves to their windows

609 For the islands wait for me and the ships of the sea in the
beginning that I may bring thy sons from afar their silver and their
gold with them to the name of the Lord thy God and to the Holy One of
Israel because he hath glorified thee

6010 And the children of strangers shall build up thy walls and
their kings shall minister to thee for in my wrath have I struck thee
and in my reconciliation have I had mercy upon thee

6011 And thy gates shall be open continually they shall not be shut
day nor night that the strength of the Gentiles may be brought to
thee and their kings may be brought

6012 For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee shall
perish and the Gentiles shall be wasted with desolation

6013 The glory of Libanus shall come to thee the fir tree and the
box tree and the pine tree together to beautify the place of my
sanctuary and I will glorify the place of my feet

6014 And the children of them that afflict thee shall come bowing
down to thee and all that slandered thee shall worship the steps of
thy feet and shall call thee the city of the Lord the Sion of the
Holy One of Israel

6015 Because thou wast forsaken and hated and there was none that
passed through thee I will make thee to be an everlasting glory a joy
unto generation and generation

6016 And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles and thou shalt be
nursed with the breasts of kings and thou shalt know that I am the
Lord thy Saviour and thy Redeemer the Mighty One of Jacob

6017 For brass I will bring gold and for iron I will bring silver
and for wood brass and for stones iron and I will make thy visitation
peace and thy overseers justice

6018 Iniquity shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor
destruction in thy borders and salvation shall possess thy walls and
praise thy gates

6019 Thou shalt no more have the sun for thy light by day neither
shall the brightness of the moon enlighten thee but the Lord shall be
unto thee for an everlasting light and thy God for thy glory

Thou shalt no more etc  In this latter part of the chapter the
prophet passes from the illustrious promises made to the church
militant on earth to the glory of the church triumphant in heaven

6020 Thy sun shall go down no more and thy moon shall not decrease
for the Lord shall be unto thee for an everlasting light and the days
of thy mourning shall be ended

6021 And thy people shall be all just they shall inherit the land
for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hand to glorify me

6022 The least shall become a thousand and a little one a most
strong nation I the Lord will suddenly do this thing in its time



Isaias Chapter 61


The office of Christ the mission of the Apostles the happiness of
their converts

611 The spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord hath anointed
me he hath sent me to preach to the meek to heal the contrite of
heart and to preach a release to the captives and deliverance to them
that are shut up

612 To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of
vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn

613 To appoint to the mourners of Sion and to give them a crown for
ashes the oil of joy for mourning a garment of praise for the spirit
of grief and they shall be called in it the mighty ones of justice
the planting of the Lord to glorify him

614 And they shall build the places that have been waste from of old
and shall raise up ancient ruins and shall repair the desolate cities
that were destroyed for generation and generation

615 And strangers shall stand and shall feed your flocks and the
sons of strangers shall be your husbandman and the dressers of your
vines

616 But you shall be called the priests of the Lord to you it shall
be said Ye ministers of our God you shall eat the riches of the
Gentiles and you shall pride yourselves in their glory

617 For your double confusion and shame they shall praise their
part therefore shall they receive double in their land everlasting
joy shall be unto them

618 For I am the Lord that love judgment and hate robbery in a
holocaust and I will make their work in truth and I will make a
perpetual covenant with them

619 And they shall know their seed among the Gentiles and their
offspring in the midst of peoples all that shall see them shall know
them that these are the seed which the Lord hath blessed

6110 I will greatly rejoice in the Lord and my soul shall be joyful
in my God for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation and
with the robe of justice he hath covered me as a bridegroom decked
with a crown and as a bride adorned with her jewels

6111 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden
causeth her seed to shoot forth so shall the Lord God make justice to
spring forth and praise before all the nations



Isaias Chapter 62


The prophet will not cease from preaching Christ to whom all nations
shall be converted and whose church shall continue for ever

621 For Sions sake I will not hold my peace and for the sake of
Jerusalem I will not rest till her just one come forth as brightness
and her saviour be lighted as a lamp

622 And the Gentiles shall see thy just one and all kings thy
glorious one and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth
of the Lord shall name

623 And thou shalt be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord and a
royal diadem in the hand of thy God

624 Thou shalt no more be called Forsaken and thy land shall no more
be called Desolate but thou shalt be called My pleasure in her and
thy land inhabited Because the Lord hath been well pleased with thee
and thy land shall be inhabited

625 For the young man shall dwell with the virgin and thy children
shall dwell in thee And the bridegroom shall rejoice over the bride
and thy God shall rejoice over thee

626 Upon thy walls O Jerusalem I have appointed watchmen all the
day and all the night they shall never hold their peace You that are
mindful of the Lord hold not your peace

627 And give him no silence till he establish and till he make
Jerusalem a praise in the earth

628 The Lord hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his
strength Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thy
enemies and the sons of the strangers shall not drink thy wine for
which thou hast laboured

629 For they that gather it shall eat it and shall praise the Lord
and they that bring it together shall drink it in my holy courts

6210 Go through go through the gates prepare the way for the
people make the road plain pick out the stones and lift up the
standard to the people

6211 Behold the Lord hath made it to be heard in the ends of the
earth tell the daughter of Sion Behold thy Saviour cometh behold his
reward is with him and his work before him

6212 And they shall call them The holy people the redeemed of the
Lord But thou shalt be called A city sought after and not forsaken



Isaias Chapter 63


Christs victory over his enemies his mercies to his people their
complaint

631 Who is this that cometh from Edom with dyed garments from Bosra
this beautiful one in his robe walking in the greatness of his
strength I that speak justice and am a defender to save

Edom  Edom and Bosra a strong city of Edom are here taken in a
mystical sense for the enemies of Christ and his church

632 Why then is thy apparel red and thy garments like theirs that
tread in the winepress

633 I have trodden the winepress alone and of the Gentiles there is
not a man with me I have trampled on them in my indignation and have
trodden them down in my wrath and their blood is sprinkled upon my
garments and I have stained all my apparel

634 For the day of vengeance is in my heart the year of my
redemption is come

635 I looked about and there was none to help I sought and there
was none to give aid and my own arm hath saved for me and my
indignation itself hath helped me

636 And I have trodden down the people in my wrath and have made
them drunk in my indignation and have brought down their strength to
the earth

637 I will remember the tender mercies of the Lord the praise of the
Lord for all the things that the Lord hath bestowed upon us and for
the multitude of his good things to the house of Israel which he hath
given them according to his kindness and according to the multitude of
his mercies

638 And he said Surely they are my people children that will not
deny so he became their saviour

639 In all their affliction he was not troubled and the angel of his
presence saved them in his love and in his mercy he redeemed them
and he carried them and lifted them up all the days of old

6310 But they provoked to wrath and afflicted the spirit of his Holy
One and he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against them

6311 And he remembered the days of old of Moses and of his people
Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of
his flock where is he that put in the midst of them the spirit of his
Holy One

6312 He that brought out Moses by the right hand by the arm of his
majesty that divided the waters before them to make himself an
everlasting name

6313 He that led them out through the deep as a horse in the
wilderness that stumbleth not

6314 As a beast that goeth down in the field the spirit of the Lord
was their leader so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a
glorious name

6315 Look down from heaven and behold from thy holy habitation and
the place of thy glory where is thy zeal and thy strength the
multitude of thy bowels and of thy mercies they have held back
themselves from me

They have held back etc  This is spoken by the prophet in the person
of the Jews at the time when for their sins they were given up to
their enemies

6316 For thou art our father and Abraham hath not known us and
Israel hath been ignorant of us thou O Lord art our father our
redeemer from everlasting is thy name

Abraham hath not know us etc  That is Abraham will not now
acknowledge us for his children by reason of our degeneracy but thou
O Lord art our true father and our redeemer and no other can be
called our parent in comparison with thee

6317 Why hast thou made us to err O Lord from thy ways why hast
thou hardened our heart that we should not fear thee return for the
sake of thy servants the tribes of thy inheritance

Made us to err etc Hardened our heart etc  The meaning is that
God in punishment of their great and manifold crimes and their long
abuse of his mercy and grace had withdrawn his graces from them and
so given them up to error and hardness of heart

6318 They have possessed thy holy people as nothing our enemies have
trodden down thy sanctuary

6319 We are become as in the beginning when thou didst not rule over
us and when we were not called by thy name



Isaias Chapter 64


The prophet prays for the release of his people and for the remission
of their sins

641 O that thou wouldst rend the heavens and wouldst come down the
mountains would melt away at thy presence

642 They would melt as at the burning of fire the waters would burn
with fire that thy name might be made known to thy enemies that the
nations might tremble at thy presence

643 When thou shalt do wonderful things we shall not bear them thou
didst come down and at thy presence the mountains melted away

644 From the beginning of the world they have not heard nor
perceived with the ears the eye hath not seen O God besides thee
what things thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee

645 Thou hast met him that rejoiceth and doth justice in thy ways
they shall remember thee behold thou art angry and we have sinned in
them we have been always and we shall be saved

646 And we are all become as one unclean and all our justices as the
rag of a menstruous woman and we have all fallen as a leaf and our
iniquities like the wind have taken us away

Our justices etc  That is the works by which we pretended to make
ourselves just This is spoken particularly of the sacrifices
sacraments and ceremonies of the Jews after the death of Christ and
the promulgation of the new law

647 There is none that calleth upon thy name that riseth up and
taketh hold of thee thou hast hid thy face from us and hast crushed
us in the hand of our iniquity

648 And now O Lord thou art our father and we are clay and thou
art our maker and we all are the works of thy hands

649 Be not very angry O Lord and remember no longer our iniquity
behold see we are all thy people

6410 The city of thy sanctuary is become a desert Sion is made a
desert Jerusalem is desolate

6411 The house of our holiness and of our glory where our fathers
praised thee is burnt with fire and all our lovely things are turned
into ruins

6412 Wilt thou refrain thyself O Lord upon these things wilt thou
hold thy peace and afflict us vehemently



Isaias Chapter 65


The Gentiles shall seek and find Christ but the Jews will persecute
him and be rejected only a remnant shall be reserved The church
shall multiply and abound with graces

651 They have sought me that before asked not for me they have found
me that sought me not I said Behold me behold me to a nation that
did not call upon my name

652 I have spread forth my hands all the day to an unbelieving
people who walk in a way that is not good after their own thoughts

653 A people that continually provoke me to anger before my face
that immolate in gardens and sacrifice upon bricks

654 That dwell in sepulchres and sleep in the temple of idols that
eat swines flesh and profane broth is in their vessels

655 That say Depart from me come not near me because thou art
unclean these shall be smoke in my anger a fire burning all the day

656 Behold it is written before me I will not be silent but I will
render and repay into their bosom

657 Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together
saith the Lord who have sacrificed upon the mountains and have
reproached me upon the hills and I will measure back their first work
in their bosom

658 Thus saith the Lord As if a grain be found in a cluster and it
be said Destroy it not because it is a blessing so will I do for the
sake of my servants that I may not destroy the whole

659 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob and out of Juda a
possessor of my mountains and my elect shall inherit it and my
servants shall dwell there

6510 And the plains shall be turned to folds of flocks and the
valley of Achor into a place for the herds to lie down in for my
people that have sought me

6511 And you that have forsaken the Lord that have forgotten my
holy mount that set a table for fortune and offer libations upon it

6512 I will number you in the sword and you shall all fall by
slaughter because I called and you did not answer I spoke and you
did not hear and you did evil in my eyes and you have chosen the
things that displease me

6513 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold my servants shall eat
and you shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink and you shall
be thirsty

6514 Behold my servants shall rejoice and you shall be confounded
behold my servants shall praise for joyfulness of heart and you shall
cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for grief of spirit

6515 And you shall leave your name for an execration to my elect and
the Lord God shall slay thee and call his servants by another name

6516 In which he that is blessed upon the earth shall be blessed in
God amen and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by God amen
because the former distresses are forgotten and because they are hid
from my eyes

6517 For behold I create new heavens and a new earth and the former
things shall not be in remembrance and they shall not come upon the
heart

6518 But you shall be glad and rejoice for ever in these things
which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and the
people thereof joy

6519 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the
voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her nor the voice of
crying

6520 There shall no more be an infant of days there nor an old man
that shall not fill up his days for the child shall die a hundred
years old and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed

6521 And they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall
plant vineyards and eat the fruits of them

6522 They shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant
and another eat for as the days of a tree so shall be the days of my
people and the works of their hands shall be of long continuance

6523 My elect shall not labour in vain nor bring forth in trouble
for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord and their posterity
with them

6524 And it shall come to pass that before they call I will hear
as they are yet speaking I will hear

6525 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion and the ox
shall eat straw and dust shall be the serpents food they shall not
hurt nor kill in all my holy mountain saith the Lord



Isaias Chapter 66


More of the reprobation of the Jews and of the call of the Gentiles

661 Thus saith the Lord Heaven is my throne and the earth my
footstool what is this house that you will build to me and what is
this place of my rest

What is this house etc  This is a prophecy that the temple should be
cast off

662 My hand made all these things and all these things were made
saith the Lord But to whom shall I have respect but to him that is
poor and little and of a contrite spirit and that trembleth at my
words

663 He that sacrificeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that
killeth a sheep in sacrifice as if he should brain a dog he that
offereth an oblation as if he should offer swines blood he that
remembereth incense as if he should bless an idol All these things
have they chosen in their ways and their soul is delighted in their
abominations

He that sacrificeth an ox etc  This is a prophecy that the
sacrifices which were offered in the old law should be abolished in the
new and that the offering of them should be a crimeIbid
Remembereth incense  Viz to offer it in the way of a sacrifice

664 Wherefore I also will choose their mockeries and will bring upon
them the things they feared because I called and there was none that
would answer I have spoken and they heard not and they have done
evil in my eyes and have chosen the things that displease me

I will choose their mockeries  I will turn their mockeries upon
themselves and will cause them to be mocked by their enemies

665 Hear the word of the Lord you that tremble at his word Your
brethren that hate you and cast you out for my names sake have said
Let the Lord be glorified and we shall see in your joy but they shall
be confounded

666 A voice of the people from the city a voice from the temple the
voice of the Lord that rendereth recompense to his enemies

667 Before she was in labour she brought forth before her time came
to be delivered she brought forth a man child

Before she was in labour etc  This relates to the conversion of the
Gentiles who were born as it were all on a sudden to the church of
God

668 Who hath ever heard such a thing and who hath seen the like to
this shall the earth bring forth in one day or shall a nation be
brought forth at once because Sion hath been in labour and hath
brought forth her children

669 Shall not I that make others to bring forth children myself
bring forth saith the Lord shall I that give generation to others
be barren saith the Lord thy God

6610 Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad with her all you that love
her rejoice for joy with her all you that mourn for her

6611 That you may suck and be filled with the breasts of her
consolations that you may milk out and flow with delights from the
abundance of her glory

6612 For thus saith the Lord Behold I will bring upon her as it were
a river of peace and as an overflowing torrent the glory of the
Gentiles which you shall suck you shall be carried at the breasts
and upon the knees they shall caress you

6613 As one whom the mother caresseth so will I comfort you and you
shall be comforted in Jerusalem

6614 You shall see and your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall
flourish like an herb and the hand of the Lord shall be known to his
servants and he shall be angry with his enemies

6615 For behold the Lord will come with fire and his chariots are
like a whirlwind to render his wrath in indignation and his rebuke
with flames of fire

6616 For the Lord shall judge by fire and by his sword unto all
flesh and the slain of the Lord shall be many

6617 They that were sanctified thought themselves clean in the
gardens behind the gate within they that did eat swines flesh and
the abomination and the mouse they shall be consumed together saith
the Lord

6618 But I know their works and their thoughts I come that I may
gather them together with all nations and tongues and they shall come
and shall see my glory

6619 And I will set a sign among them and I will send of them that
shall be saved to the Gentiles into the sea into Africa and Lydia
them that draw the bow into Italy and Greece to the islands afar
off to them that have not heard of me and have not seen my glory And
they shall declare my glory to the Gentiles

6620 And they shall bring all your brethren out of all nations for a
gift to the Lord upon horses and in chariots and in litters and on
mules and in coaches to my holy mountain Jerusalem saith the Lord
as if the children of Israel should bring an offering in a clean vessel
into the house of the Lord

6621 And I will take of them to be priests and Levites saith the
Lord

6622 For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make to
stand before me saith the Lord so shall your seed stand and your
name

6623 And there shall be month after month and sabbath after sabbath
and all flesh shall come to adore before my face saith the Lord

6624 And they shall go out and see the carcasses of the men that
have transgressed against me their worm shall not die and their fire
shall not be quenched and they shall be a loathsome sight to all
flesh




THE PROPHECY OF JEREMIAS



Jeremias was a priest a native of Anathoth a priestly city in the
tribe of Benjamin and was sanctified from his mothers womb to be a
prophet of God which office he began to execute when he was yet a
child in age He was in his whole life according to the signification
of his name Great before the Lord and a special figure of Jesus
Christ in the persecutions he underwent for discharging his duty in
his charity for his persecutors and in the violent death he suffered
at their hands it being an ancient tradition of the Hebrews that he
was stoned to death by the remnant of the Jews who had retired into
Egypt



Jeremias Chapter 1


The time and the calling of Jeremias his prophetical visions God
encourages him

11 The words of Jeremias the son of Helcias of the priests that were
in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin

12 The word of the Lord which came to him in the days of Josias the
son of Amon king of Juda in the thirteenth year of his reign

13 And which came to him in the days of Joakim the son of Josias king
of Juda unto the end of the eleventh year of Sedecias the son of
Josias king of Juda even unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive
in the fifth month

14 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

15 Before I formed thee in the bowels of thy mother I knew thee and
before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and made
thee a prophet unto the nations

16 And I said Ah ah ah Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am
a child

17 And the Lord said to me Say not I am a child for thou shalt go
to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I shall command thee
thou shalt speak

18 Be not afraid at their presence for I am with thee to deliver
thee saith the Lord

19 And the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the
Lord said to me Behold I have given my words in thy mouth

110 Lo I have set thee this day over the nations and over kingdoms
to root up and to pull down and to waste and to destroy and to
build and to plant

111 And the word of the Lord came to me saying What seest thou
Jeremias And I said I see a rod watching

112 And the Lord said to me Thou hast seen well for I will watch
over my word to perform it

113 And the word of the Lord came to me a second time saying What
seest thou And I said I see a boiling caldron and the face thereof
from the face of the north

114 And the Lord said to me From the north shall an evil break forth
upon all the inhabitants of the land

115 For behold I will call together all the families of the kingdoms
of the north saith the Lord and they shall come and shall set every
one his throne in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem and upon all
the walls thereof round about and upon all the cities of Juda

116 And I will pronounce my judgments against them touching all
their wickedness who have forsaken me and have sacrificed to strange
gods and have adored the work of their own hands

117 Thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak to them
all that I command thee Be not afraid at their presence for I will
make thee not to fear their countenance

118 For behold I have made thee this day a fortified city and a
pillar of iron and a wall of brass over all the land to the kings of
Juda to the princes thereof and to the priests and to the people of
the land

119 And they shall fight against them and shall not prevail for I
am with thee saith the Lord to deliver thee



Jeremias Chapter 2


God expostulates with the Jews for their ingratitude and infidelity

21 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

22 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying Thus saith the Lord
I have remembered thee pitying thy youth and the love of thy
espousals when thou followedst me in the desert in a land that is not
sown

23 Israel is holy to the Lord the firstfruits of his increase all
they that devour him offend evils shall come upon them saith the
Lord

24 Hear ye the word of the Lord O house of Jacob and all ye
families of the house of Israel

25 Thus saith the Lord What iniquity have your fathers found in me
that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are
become vain

26 And they have not said Where is the Lord that made us come up
out of the land of Egypt that led us through the desert through a
land uninhabited and unpassable through a land of drought and the
image of death through a land wherein no man walked nor any man
dwelt

27 And I brought you into the land of Carmel to eat the fruit
thereof and the best things thereof and when ye entered in you
defiled my land and made my inheritance an abomination

Carmel  That is a fruitful plentiful land

28 The priests did not say Where is the Lord and they that held the
law knew me not and the pastors transgressed against me and the
prophets prophesied in Baal and followed idols

29 Therefore will I yet contend in judgment with you saith the Lord
and I will plead with your children

210 Pass over to the isles of Cethim and see and send into Cedar
and consider diligently and see if there hath been done any thing like
this

211 If a nation hath changed their gods and indeed they are not
gods but my people have changed their glory into an idol

212 Be astonished O ye heavens at this and ye gates thereof be
very desolate saith the Lord

213 For my people have done two evils They have forsaken me the
fountain of living water and have digged to themselves cisterns
broken cisterns that can hold no water

214 Is Israel a bondman or a homeborn slave why then is he become a
prey

215 The lions have roared upon him and have made a noise they have
made his land a wilderness his cities are burnt down and there is
none to dwell in them

216 The children also of Memphis and of Taphnes have defloured thee
even to the crown of the head

217 Hath not this been done to thee because thou hast forsaken the
Lord thy God at that time when he led thee by the way

218 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt to drink the
troubled water And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians
to drink the water of the river

219 Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee and thy apostasy shall
rebuke thee Know thou and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing
for thee to have left the Lord thy God and that my fear is not with
thee saith the Lord the God of hosts

220 Of old time thou hast broken my yoke thou hast burst my bands
and thou saidst I will not serve For on every high hill and under
every green tree thou didst prostitute thyself

221 Yet I planted thee a chosen vineyard all true seed how then
art thou turned unto me into that which is good for nothing O strange
vineyard

222 Though thou wash thyself with nitre and multiply to thyself the
herb borith thou art stained in thy iniquity before me saith the Lord
God

Borith  An herb used to clean clothes and take out spots and dirt

223 How canst thou say I am not polluted I have not walked after
Baalim see thy ways in the valley know what thou hast done as a
swift runner pursuing his course

224 A wild ass accustomed to the wilderness in the desire of his
heart snuffed up the wind of his love none shall turn her away all
that seek her shall not fail in her monthly filth they shall find her

225 Keep thy foot from being bare and thy throat from thirst But
thou saidst I have lost all hope I will not do it for I have loved
strangers and I will walk after them

226 As the thief is confounded when he is taken so is the house of
Israel confounded they and their kings their princes and their
priests and their prophets

227 Saying to a stock Thou art my father and to a stone Thou hast
begotten me they have turned their back to me and not their face and
in the time of their affliction they will say Arise and deliver us

228 Where are the gods whom thou hast made thee let them arise and
deliver thee in the time of thy affliction for according to the number
of thy cities were thy gods O Juda

229 Why will you contend with me in judgment you have all forsaken
me saith the Lord

230 In vain have I struck your children they have not received
correction your sword hath devoured your prophets your generation is
like a ravaging lion

231 See ye the word of the Lord Am I become a wilderness to Israel
or a lateward springing land why then have my people said We are
revolted we will come to thee no more

232 Will a virgin forget her ornament or a bride her stomacher but
my people hath forgotten me days without number

233 Why dost thou endeavour to shew thy way good to seek my love
thou who hast also taught thy malices to be thy ways

234 And in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor and
innocent not in ditches have I found them but in all places which I
mentioned before

235 And thou hast said I am without sin and am innocent and
therefore let thy anger be turned away from me Behold I will contend
with thee in judgment because thou hast said I have not sinned

236 How exceeding base art thou become going the same ways over
again and thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt as thou wast ashamed of
Assyria

237 For from thence thou shalt go and thy hand shall be upon thy
head for the Lord hath destroyed thy trust and thou shalt have
nothing prosperous therein



Jeremias Chapter 3


God invites the rebel Jews to return to him with a promise to receive
them he foretells the conversion of the Gentiles

31 It is commonly said If a man put away his wife and she go from
him and marry another man shall he return to her any more shall not
that woman be polluted and defiled but thou hast prostituted thyself
to many lovers nevertheless return to me saith the Lord and I will
receive thee

32 Lift up thy eyes on high and see where thou hast not prostituted
thyself thou didst sit in the ways waiting for them as a robber in
the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications
and with thy wickedness

33 Therefore the showers were withholden and there was no lateward
rain thou hadst a harlots forehead thou wouldst not blush

34 Therefore at the least from this time call to me Thou art my
father the guide of my virginity

35 Wilt thou be angry for ever or wilt thou continue unto the end
Behold thou hast spoken and hast done evil things and hast been
able

36 And the Lord said to me in the days of king Josias Hast thou seen
what rebellious Israel hath done she hath gone of herself upon every
high mountain and under every green tree and hath played the harlot
there

37 And when she had done all these things I said Return to me and
she did not return And her treacherous sister Juda saw

38 That because the rebellious Israel had played the harlot I had
put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous
sister Juda was not afraid but went and played the harlot also
herself

39 And by the facility of her fornication she defiled the land and
played the harlot with stones and with stocks

310 And after all this her treacherous sister Juda hath not returned
to me with her whole heart but with falsehood saith the Lord

311 And the Lord said to me The rebellious Israel hath justified her
soul in comparison of the treacherous Juda

312 Go and proclaim these words towards the north and thou shalt
say Return O rebellious Israel saith the Lord and I will not turn
away my face from you for I am holy saith the Lord and I will not be
angry for ever

313 But yet acknowledge thy iniquity that thou hast transgressed
against the Lord thy God and thou hast scattered thy ways to strangers
under every green tree and hast not heard my voice saith the Lord

314 Return O ye revolting children saith the Lord for I am your I
husband and I will take you one of a city and two of a kindred and
will bring you into Sion

315 And I will give you pastors according to my own heart and they
shall feed you with knowledge and doctrine

316 And when you shall be multiplied and increase in the land in
those days saith the Lord they shall say no more The ark of the
covenant of the Lord neither shall it come upon the heart neither
shall they remember it neither shall it be visited neither shall that
be done any more

317 At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the Lord
and all the nations shall be gathered together to it in the name of
the Lord to Jerusalem and they shall not walk after the perversity of
their most wicked heart

318 In those days the house of Juda shall go to the house of Israel
and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land
which I gave to your fathers

319 But I said How shall I put thee among the children and give
thee a lovely land the goodly inheritance of the armies of the
Gentiles And I said Thou shalt call me father and shalt not cease to
walk after me

320 But as a woman that despiseth her lover so hath the house of
Israel despised me saith the Lord

321 A voice was heard in the highways weeping and howling of the
children of Israel because they have made their way wicked they have
forgotten the Lord their God

322 Return you rebellious children and I will heal your rebellions
Behold we come to thee for thou art the Lord our God

323 In very deed the hills were liars and the multitude of the
mountains truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel

324 Confusion hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth
their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters

325 We shall sleep in our confusion and our shame shall cover us
because we have sinned against the Lord our God we and our fathers
from our youth even to this day and we have not hearkened to the voice
of the Lord our God



Jeremias Chapter 4


And admonition to sincere repentance and circumcision of the heart
with threats of grievous punishment to those that persist in sin

41 If thou wilt return O Israel saith the Lord return to me if
thou wilt take away thy stumblingblocks out of my sight thou shalt not
be moved

42 And thou shalt swear As the Lord liveth in truth and in
judgment and in justice and the Gentiles shall bless him and shall
praise him

43 For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda and Jerusalem Break up
anew your fallow ground and sow not upon thorns

44 Be circumcised to the Lord and take away the foreskins of your
hearts ye men of Juda and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem lest my
indignation come forth like fire and burn and there be none that can
quench it because of the wickedness of your thoughts

45 Declare ye in Juda and make it heard in Jerusalem speak and
sound with the trumpet in the land cry aloud and say Assemble
yourselves and let us go into strong cities

46 Set up the standard in Sion Strengthen yourselves stay not for
I bring evil from the north and great destruction

47 The lion is come up out of his den and the robber of nations hath
roused himself he is come forth out of his place to make thy land
desolate thy cities shall be laid waste remaining without an
inhabitant

48 For this gird yourselves with haircloth lament and howl for the
fierce anger of the Lord is not turned away from us

49 And it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord That the
heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the
priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall be amazed

410 And I said Alas alas alas O Lord God hast thou then deceived
this people and Jerusalem saying You shall have peace and behold the
sword reacheth even to the soul

411 At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem A
burning wind is in the ways that are in the desert of the way of the
daughter of my people not to fan nor to cleanse

412 A full wind from these places shall come to me and now I will
speak my judgments with them

413 Behold he shall come up as a cloud and his chariots as a
tempest his horses are swifter than eagles woe unto us for we are
laid waste

414 Wash thy heart from wickedness O Jerusalem that thou mayst be
saved how long shall hurtful thoughts abide in thee

415 For a voice of one declaring from Dan and giving notice of the
idol from mount Ephraim

416 Say ye to the nations Behold it is heard in Jerusalem that
guards are coming from a far country and give out their voice against
the cities of Juda

417 They are set round about her as keepers of fields because she
hath provoked me to wrath saith the Lord

418 Thy ways and thy devices have brought these things upon thee
this is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it hath touched
thy heart

419 My bowels my bowels are in part the senses of my heart are
troubled within me I will not hold my peace for my soul hath heard
the sound of the trumpet the cry of battle

420 Destruction upon destruction is called for and all the earth is
laid waste my tents are destroyed on a sudden and my pavilions in a
moment

421 How long shall I see men fleeing away how long shall I hear the
sound of the trumpet

422 For my foolish people have not known me they are foolish and
senseless children they are wise to do evil but to do good they have
no knowledge

423 I beheld the earth and lo it was void and nothing and the
heavens and there was no light in them

424 I looked upon the mountains and behold they trembled and all
the hills were troubled

425 I beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the air
were gone

426 I looked and behold Carmel was a wilderness and all its cities
were destroyed at the presence of the Lord and at the presence of the
wrath of his indignation

427 For thus saith the Lord All the land shall be desolate but yet
I will not utterly destroy

428 The Earth shall mourn and the heavens shall lament from above
because I have spoken I have purposed and I have not repented
neither am I turned away from it

429 At the voice of the horsemen and the archers all the city is
fled away they have entered into thickets and climbed up the rocks
all the cities are forsaken and there dwelleth not a man in them

430 But when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do though thou clothest
thyself with scarlet though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold
and paintest thy eyes with stibic stone thou shalt dress thyself out
in vain thy lovers have despised thee they will seek thy life

431 For I have heard the voice as of a woman in travail anguishes as
of a woman in labour of a child The voice of the daughter of Sion
dying away spreading her hands Woe is me for my soul hath fainted
because of them that are slain



Jeremias Chapter 5


The judgments of God shall fall upon the Jews for their manifold sins

51 Go about through the streets of Jerusalem and see and consider
and seek in the broad places thereof if you can find a man that
executeth judgment and seeketh faith and I will be merciful unto it

52 And though they say The Lord liveth this also they will swear
falsely

53 O Lord thy eyes are upon truth thou hast struck them and they
have not grieved thou hast bruised them and they have refused to
receive correction they have made their faces harder than the rock
and they have refused to return

54 But I said Perhaps these are poor and foolish that know not the
way of the Lord the judgment of their God

55 I will go therefore to the great men and will speak to them for
they have known the way of the Lord the judgment of their God and
behold these have altogether broken the yoke more and have burst the
bonds

56 Wherefore a lion out of the wood hath slain them a wolf in the
evening hath spoiled them a leopard watcheth for their cities every
one that shall go out thence shall be taken because their
transgressions are multiplied their rebellions are strengthened

57 How can I be merciful to thee thy children have forsaken me and
swear by them that are not gods I fed them to the full and they
committed adultery and rioted in the harlots house

58 They are become as amorous horses and stallions every one neighed
after his neighbours wife

59 Shall I not visit for these things saith the Lord and shall not
my soul take revenge on such a nation

510 Scale the walls thereof and throw them down but do not utterly
destroy take away the branches thereof because they are not the
Lords

511 For the house of Israel and the house of Juda have greatly
transgressed against me saith the Lord

512 They have denied the Lord and said It is not he and the evil
shall not come upon us we shall not see the sword and famine

513 The prophets have spoken in the wind and there was no word of
God in them these things therefore shall befall them

514 Thus saith the Lord the God of hosts because you have spoken
this word behold I will make my words in thy mouth as fire and this
people as wood and it shall devour them

515 Behold I will bring upon you a nation from afar O house of
Israel saith the Lord a strong nation an ancient nation a nation
whose language thou shalt not know nor understand what they say

516 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre they are all valiant

517 And they shall eat up thy corn and thy bread they shall devour
thy sons and thy daughters they shall eat up thy flocks and thy
herds they shall eat thy vineyards and thy figs and with the sword
they shall destroy thy strong cities wherein thou trustest

518 Nevertheless in those days saith the Lord I will not bring you
to utter destruction

519 And if you shall say Why hath the Lord our God done all these
things to us thou shalt say to them As you have forsaken me and
served a strange god in your own land so shall you serve strangers in
a land that is not your own

520 Declare ye this to the house of Jacob and publish it in Juda
saying

521 Hear O foolish people and without understanding who have eyes
and see not and ears and hear not

522 Will not you then fear me saith the Lord and will you not
repent at my presence I have set the sand a bound for the sea an
everlasting ordinance which it shall not pass over and the waves
thereof shall toss themselves and shall not prevail they shall swell
and shall not pass over it

523 But the heart of this people is become hard of belief and
provoking they are revolted and gone away

524 And they have not said in their heart Let us fear the Lord our
God who giveth us the early and the latter rain in due season who
preserveth for us the fulness of the yearly harvest

525 Your iniquities have turned these things away and your sins have
withholden good things from you

526 For among my people are found wicked men that lie in wait as
fowlers setting snares and traps to catch men

527 As a net is full of birds so their houses are full of deceit
therefore are they become great and enriched

528 They are grown gross and fat and have most wickedly transgressed
my words They have not judged the cause of the widow they have not
managed the cause of the fatherless and they have not judged the
judgment of the poor

529 Shall I not visit for these things saith the Lord or shall not
my soul take revenge on such a nation

530 Astonishing and wonderful things have been done in the land

531 The prophets prophesied falsehood and the priests clapped their
hands and my people loved such things what then shall be done in the
end thereof



Jeremias Chapter 6


The evils that threaten Jerusalem She is invited to return and walk
in the good way and not to rely on sacrifices without obedience

61 Strengthen yourselves ye sons of Benjamin in the midst of
Jerusalem and sound the trumpet in Thecua and set up the standard
over Bethacarem for evil is seen out of the north and a great
destruction

62 I have likened the daughter of Sion to a beautiful and delicate
woman

63 The shepherds shall come to her with their flocks they have
pitched their tents against her round about every one shall feed them
that are under his hand

64 Prepare ye war against her arise and let us go up at midday woe
unto us for the day is declined for the shadows of the evening are
grown longer

65 Arise and let us go up in the night and destroy her houses

66 For thus saith the Lord of hosts Hew down her trees cast up a
trench about Jerusalem this is the city to be visited all oppression
is in the midst of her

67 As a cistern maketh its water cold so hath she made her
wickedness cold violence and spoil shall be heard in her infirmity
and stripes are continually before me

68 Be thou instructed O Jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee
lest I make thee desolate a land uninhabited

69 Thus saith the Lord of hosts They shall gather the remains of
Israel as in a vine even to one cluster turn back thy hand as a
grapegatherer into the basket

610 To whom shall I speak and to whom shall I testify that he may
hear behold their ears are uncircumcised and they cannot hear
behold the word of the Lord is become unto them a reproach and they
will not receive it

611 Therefore am I full of the fury of the Lord I am weary with
holding in pour it out upon the child abroad and upon the council of
the young men together for man and woman shall be taken the ancient
and he that is full of days

612 And their houses shall be turned over to others with their lands
and their wives together for I will stretch forth my hand upon the
inhabitants of the land saith the Lord

613 For from the least of them even to the greatest all are given to
covetousness and from the prophet even to the priest all are guilty
of deceit

614 And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people
disgracefully saying Peace peace and there was no peace

615 They were confounded because they committed abomination yea
rather they were not confounded with confusion and they knew not how
to blush wherefore they shall fall among them that fall in the time
of their visitation they shall fall down saith the Lord

616 Thus saith the Lord Stand ye on the ways and see and ask for
the old paths which is the good way and walk ye in it and you shall
find refreshment for your souls And they said We will not walk

617 And I appointed watchmen over you saying Hearken ye to the
sound of the trumpet And they said We will not hearken

618 Therefore hear ye nations and know O congregation what great
things I will do to them

619 Hear O earth Behold I will bring evils upon this people the
fruits of their own thoughts because they have not heard my words and
they have cast away my law

620 To what purpose do you bring me frankincense from Saba and the
sweet smelling cane from a far country your holocausts are not
acceptable nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me

621 Therefore thus saith the Lord Behold I will bring destruction
upon this people by which fathers and sons together shall fall
neighbour and kinsman shall perish

622 Thus saith the Lord Behold a people cometh from the land of the
north and a great nation shall rise up from the ends of the earth

623 They shall lay hold on arrow and shield they are cruel and will
have no mercy Their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall
mount upon horses prepared as men for war against thee O daughter of
Sion

624 We have heard the fame thereof our hands grow feeble anguish
hath taken hold of us as a woman in labour

625 Go not out into the fields nor walk in the highway for the
sword of the enemy and fear is on every side

626 Gird thee with sackcloth O daughter of my people and sprinkle
thee with ashes make thee mourning as for an only son a bitter
lamentation because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us

627 I have set thee for a strong trier among my people and thou
shalt know and prove their way

628 All these princes go out of the way they walk deceitfully they
are brass and iron they are all corrupted

629 The bellows have failed the lead is consumed in the fire the
founder hath melted in vain for their wicked deeds are not consumed

630 Call them reprobate silver for the Lord hath rejected them



Jeremias Chapter 7


The temple of God shall not protect a sinful people without a sincere
conversion The Lord will not receive the prayers of the prophet for
them because they are obstinate in their sins

71 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord saying

72 Stand in the gate of the house of the Lord and proclaim there
this word and say Hear ye the word of the Lord all ye men of Juda
that enter in at these gates to adore the Lord

73 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Make your ways and
your doings good and I will dwell with you in this place

74 Trust not in lying words saying The temple of the Lord the
temple of the Lord it is the temple of the Lord

75 For if you will order well your ways and your doings if you will
execute judgment between a man and his neighbour

76 If you oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow
and shed not innocent blood in this place and walk not after strange
gods to your own hurt

77 I will dwell with you in this place in the land which I gave to
your fathers from the beginning and for evermore

78 Behold you put your trust in lying words which shall not profit
you

79 To steal to murder to commit adultery to swear falsely to
offer to Baalim and to go after strange gods which you know not

710 And you have come and stood before me in this house in which my
name is called upon and have said We are delivered because we have
done all these abominations

711 Is this house then in which my name hath been called upon in
your eyes become a den of robbers I I am he I have seen it saith
the Lord

712 Go ye to my place in Silo where my name dwelt from the
beginning and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people
Israel

713 And now because you have done all these works saith the Lord
and I have spoken to you rising up early and speaking and you have
not heard and I have called you and you have not answered

714 I will do to this house in which my name is called upon and in
which you trust and to the place which I have given you and your
fathers as I did to Silo

715 And I will cast you away from before my face as I have cast away
all your brethren the whole seed of Ephraim

716 Therefore do not thou pray for this people nor take to thee
praise and supplication for them and do not withstand me for I will
not hear thee

717 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Juda and in the
streets of Jerusalem

718 The children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and
the women knead the dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to
offer libations to strange gods and to provoke me to anger

Queen of heaven  That is the moon which they worshipped under that
name

719 Do they provoke me to anger saith the Lord is it not
themselves to the confusion of their own countenance

720 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold my wrath and my
indignation is enkindled against this place upon men and upon beasts
and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruits of the land and
it shall burn and shall not be quenched

721 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Add your burnt
offerings to your sacrifices and eat ye the flesh

722 For I spoke not to your fathers and I commanded them not in the
day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning the matter
of burnt offerings and sacrifices

I commanded them not  Viz such sacrifices as the Jews at this time
offered without obedience which was the thing principally commanded
so that in comparison with it the offering of the holocausts and
sacrifices was of small account

723 But this thing I commanded them saying Hearken to my voice and
I will be your God and you shall be my people and walk ye in all the
way that I have commanded you that it may be well with you

724 But they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in
their own will and in the perversity of their wicked heart and went
backward and not forward

725 From the day that their fathers came out of the land of Egypt
even to this day And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets
from day to day rising up early and sending

726 And they have not hearkened to me nor inclined their ear but
have hardened their neck and have done worse than their fathers

727 And thou shalt speak to them all these words but they will not
hearken to thee and thou shalt call them but they will not answer
thee

728 And thou shalt say to them This is a nation which hath not
hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God nor received instruction
faith is lost and is taken away out of their mouth

729 Cut off thy hair and cast it away and take up a lamentation on
high for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his
wrath

730 Because the children of Juda have done evil in my eyes saith the
Lord They have set their abominations in the house in which my name is
called upon to pollute it

731 And they have built the high places of Topheth which is in the
valley of the son of Ennom to burn their sons and their daughters in
the fire which I commanded not nor thought on in my heart

732 Therefore behold the days shall come saith the Lord and it
shall no more be called Topheth nor the valley of the son of Ennom
but the valley of slaughter and they shall bury in Topheth because
there is no place

733 And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of
the air and for the beasts of the earth and there shall be none to
drive them away

734 And I will cause to cease out of the cities of Juda and out of
the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness
the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land
shall be desolate



Jeremias Chapter 8


Other evils that shall fall upon the Jews for their impenitence

81 At that time saith the Lord they shall cast out the bones of the
kings of Juda and the bones of the princes thereof and the bones of
the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem out of their graves

82 And they shall spread them abroad to the sun and the moon and
all the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have
served and after whom have walked and whom they have sought and
adored they shall not be gathered and they shall not be buried they
shall be as dung upon the face of the earth

83 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all that shall
remain of this wicked kindred in all places which are left to which I
have cast them out saith the Lord of hosts

84 And thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord Shall not he that
falleth rise again and he that is turned away shall he not turn
again

85 Why then is this people in Jerusalem turned away with a stubborn
revolting they have laid hold on lying and have refused to return

86 I attended and hearkened no man speaketh what is good there is
none that doth penance for his sin saying What have I done They are
all turned to their own course as a horse rushing to the battle

87 The kite in the air hath known her time the turtle and the
swallow and the stork have observed the time of their coming but my
people have not known the judgment of the Lord

88 How do you say We are wise and the law of the Lord is with us
Indeed the lying pens of the scribes hath wrought falsehood

89 The wise men are confounded they are dismayed and taken for
they have cast away the word of the Lord and there is no wisdom in
them

810 Therefore will I give their women to strangers their fields to
others for an inheritance because from the least even to the greatest
all follow covetousness from the prophet even to the priest all deal
deceitfully

811 And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people
disgracefully saying Peace peace when there was no peace

812 They are confounded because they have committed abomination yea
rather they are not confounded with confusion and they have not known
how to blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the
time of their visitation they shall fall saith the Lord

813 Gathering I will gather them together saith the Lord there is
no grape on the vines and there are no figs on the fig tree the leaf
is fallen and I have given them the things that are passed away

814 Why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into
the fenced city and let us be silent there for the Lord our God hath
put us to silence and hath given us water of gall to drink for we
have sinned against the Lord

815 We looked for peace and no good came for a time of healing and
behold fear

816 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan all the land was
moved at the sound of the neighing of his warriors and they came and
devoured the land and all that was in it the city and its
inhabitants

817 For behold I will send among you serpents basilisks against
which there is no charm and they shall bite you saith the Lord

818 My sorrow is above sorrow my heart mourneth within me

819 Behold the voice of the daughter of my people from a far country
Is not the Lord in Sion or is not her king in her why then have they
provoked me to wrath with their idols and strange vanities

820 The harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not saved

821 For the affliction of the daughter of my people I am afflicted
and made sorrowful astonishment hath taken hold on me

822 Is there no balm in Galaad or is there no physician there Why
then is not the wound of the daughter of my people closed



Jeremias Chapter 9


The prophet laments the miseries of his people and their sins which
are the cause of them He exhorts them to repentance

91 Who will give water to my head and a fountain of tears to my
eyes and I will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my
people

92 Who will give me in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring
men and I will leave my people and depart from them because they are
all adulterers an assembly of transgressors

93 And they have bent their tongue as a bow for lies and not for
truth they have strengthened themselves upon the earth for they have
proceeded from evil to evil and me they have not known saith the
Lord

94 Let every man take heed of his neighbour and let him not trust in
any brother of his for every brother will utterly supplant and every
friend will walk deceitfully

95 And a man shall mock his brother and they will not speak the
truth for they have taught their tongue to speak lies they have
laboured to commit iniquity

96 Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they have
refused to know me saith the Lord

97 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts Behold I will melt and
try them for what else shall I do before the daughter of my people

98 Their tongue is a piercing arrow it hath spoken deceit with his
mouth one speaketh peace with his friend and secretly he lieth in wait
for him

99 Shall I not visit them for these things saith the Lord or shall
not my soul be revenged on such a nation

910 For the mountains I will take up weeping and lamentation and for
the beautiful places of the desert mourning because they are burnt
up for that there is not a man that passeth through them and they
have not heard the voice of the owner from the fowl of the air to the
beasts they are gone away and departed

911 And I will make Jerusalem to be heaps of sand and dens of
dragons and I will make the cities of Juda desolate for want of an
inhabitant

912 Who is the wise man that may understand this and to whom the
word of the mouth of the Lord may come that he may declare this why
the land hath perished and is burnt up like a wilderness which none
passeth through

913 And the Lord said Because they have forsaken my law which I
gave them and have not heard my voice and have not walked in it

914 But they have gone after the perverseness of their own heart and
after Baalim which their fathers taught them

915 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Behold
I will feed this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to
drink

916 And I will scatter them among the nations which they and their
fathers have not known and I will send the sword after them till they
be consumed

917 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Consider ye and
call for the mourning women and let them come and send to them that
are wise women and let them make haste

918 Let them hasten and take up a lamentation for us let our eyes
shed tears and our eyelids run down with waters

919 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Sion How are we wasted
and greatly confounded because we have left the land because our
dwellings are cast down

920 Hear therefore ye women the word of the Lord and let your ears
receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and
every one her neighbour mourning

921 For death is come up through our windows it is entered into our
houses to destroy the children from without the young men from the
streets

922 Speak Thus saith the Lord Even the carcass of man shall fall as
dung upon the face of the country and as grass behind the back of the
mower and there is none to gather it

923 Thus saith the Lord Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom
and let not the strong man glory in his strength and let not the rich
man glory in his riches

924 But let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth
and knoweth me for I am the Lord that exercise mercy and judgment
and justice in the earth for these things please me saith the Lord

925 Behold the days come saith the Lord and I will visit upon
every one that hath the foreskin circumcised

926 Upon Egypt and upon Juda and upon Edom and upon the children
of Ammon and upon Moab and upon all that have their hair polled
round that dwell in the desert for all the nations are uncircumcised
in the flesh but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the
heart



Jeremias Chapter 10


Neither stars nor idols are to be feared but the great Creator of all
things The chastisement of Jerusalem for her sins

101 Hear ye the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning you O
house of Israel

102 Thus saith the Lord Learn not according to the ways of the
Gentiles and be not afraid of the signs of heaven which the heathens
fear

103 For the laws of the people are vain for the works of the hand of
the workman hath cut a tree out of the forest with an axe

104 He hath decked it with silver and gold he hath put it together
with nails and hammers that it may not fall asunder

105 They are framed after the likeness of a palm tree and shall not
speak they must be carried to be removed because they cannot go
Therefore fear them not for they can neither do evil nor good

106 There is none like to thee O Lord thou art great and great is
thy name in might

107 Who shall not fear thee O king of nations for thine is the
glory among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms
there is none like unto thee

108 They shall be all proved together to be senseless and foolish
the doctrine of their vanity is wood

109 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis and gold from
Ophaz the work of the artificer and of the hand of the coppersmith
violet and purple is their clothing all these things are the work of
artificers

1010 But the Lord is the true God he is the living God and the
everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations
shall not be able to abide his threatening

1011 Thus then shall you say to them The gods that have not made
heaven and earth let them perish from the earth and from among those
places that are under heaven

1012 He that maketh the earth by his power that prepareth the world
by his wisdom and stretcheth out the heavens by his knowledge

1013 At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the heaven and
lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings
for rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures

1014 Every man is become a fool for knowledge every artist is
confounded in his graven idol for what he hath cast is false and
there is no spirit in them

1015 They are vain things and a ridiculous work in the time of
their visitation they shall perish

1016 The portion of Jacob is not like these for it is he who formed
all things and Israel is the rod of his inheritance the Lord of hosts
is his name

1017 Gather up thy shame out of the land thou that dwellest in a
siege

1018 For thus saith he Lord Behold I will cast away far off the
inhabitants of the land at this time and I will afflict them so that
they may be found

1019 Woe is me for my destruction my wound is very grievous But I
said Truly this is my own evil and I will bear it

1020 My tabernacle is laid waste all my cords are broken my
children are gone out from me and they are not there is none to
stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains

1021 Because the pastors have done foolishly and have not sought the
Lord therefore have they not understood and all their flock is
scattered

1022 Behold the sound of a noise cometh a great commotion out of the
land of the north to make the cities of Juda a desert and a dwelling
for dragons

1023 I know O Lord that the way of a man is not his neither is it
in a man to walk and to direct his steps

The way of a man is not his  The meaning is that notwithstanding
mans free will yet he can do no good without Gods help nor evil
without his permission So that in the present case all the evils
which Nabuchodonosor was about to bring upon Jerusalem could not have
come but by the will of God

1024 Correct me O Lord but yet with judgment and not in thy fury
lest thou bring me to nothing

1025 Pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not known
thee and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy name
because they have eaten up Jacob and devoured him and consumed him
and have destroyed his glory



Jeremias Chapter 11


The prophet proclaims the covenant of God and denounces evils to the
obstinate transgressors of it The conspiracy of the Jews against him
a figure of their conspiracy against Christ

111 The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias saying

112 Hear ye the words of this covenant and speak to the men of Juda
and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem

113 And thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord the God of
Israel Cursed is the man that shall not hearken to the words of this
covenant

114 Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out
of the land of Egypt from the iron furnace saying Hear ye my voice
and do all things that I command you and you shall be my people and I
will be your God

115 That I may accomplish the oath which I swore to your fathers to
give them a land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day And I
answered and said Amen O Lord

116 And the Lord said to me Proclaim aloud all these words in the
cities of Juda and in the streets of Jerusalem saying Hear ye the
words of the covenant and do them

117 For protesting I conjured your fathers in the day that I brought
them out of the land of Egypt even to this day rising early I conjured
them and said Hearken ye to my voice

118 And they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every one
in the perverseness of his own wicked heart and I brought upon them
all the words of this covenant which I commanded them to do but they
did them not

119 And the Lord said to me A conspiracy is found among the men of
Juda and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem

1110 They are returned to the former iniquities of their fathers who
refused to hear my words so these likewise have gone after strange
gods to serve them the house of Israel and the house of Juda have
made void my covenant which I made with their fathers

1111 Wherefore thus saith the Lord Behold I will bring in evils upon
them which they shall not be able to escape and they shall cry to me
and I will not hearken to them

1112 And the cities of Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall
go and cry to the gods to whom they offer sacrifice and they shall
not save them in the time of their affliction

1113 For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods O Juda
and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem thou hast set
up altars of confusion altars to offer sacrifice to Baalim

1114 Therefore do not thou pray for this people and do not take up
praise and prayer for them for I will not hear them in the time of
their cry to me in the time of their affliction

1115 What is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought much wickedness
in my house shall the holy flesh take away from thee thy crimes in
which thou hast boasted

1116 The Lord called thy name a plentiful olive tree fair
fruitful and beautiful at the noise of a word a great fire was
kindled in it and the branches thereof are burnt

1117 And the Lord of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evil
against thee for the evils of the house of Israel and of the house of
Juda which they have done to themselves to provoke me offering
sacrifice to Baalim

1118 But thou O Lord hast shewn me and I have known then thou
shewedst me their doings

1119 And I was as a meek lamb that is carried to be a victim and I
knew not that they had devised counsels against me saying Let us put
wood on his bread and cut him off from the land of the living and let
his name be remembered no more

1120 But thou O Lord of Sabaoth who judgest justly and triest the
reins and the hearts let me see thy revenge on them for to thee have
I revealed my cause

Sabaoth  That is of hosts or armies a name frequently given to God
in the scripturesIbid Thy revenge  This was rather a prediction
of what was to happen with an approbation of the divine justice than an
imprecation

1121 Therefore thus saith the Lord to the men of Anathoth who seek
thy life and say Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord and
thou shalt not die in our hands

1122 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts Behold I will visit upon
them their young men shall die by the sword their sons and their
daughters shall die by famine

1123 And there shall be no remains of them for I will bring in evil
upon the men of Anathoth the year of their visitation



Jeremias Chapter 12


The prosperity of the wicked shall be but for a short time The
desolation of the Jews for their sins Their return from their
captivity

121 Thou indeed O Lord art just if I plead with thee but yet I
will speak what is just to thee Why doth the way of the wicked
prosper why is it well with all them that transgress and do wickedly

122 Thou hast planted them and they have taken root they prosper
and bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their
reins

123 And thou O Lord hast known me thou hast seen me and proved my
heart with thee gather them together as for the day of slaughter

124 How long shall the land mourn and the herb of every field wither
for the wickedness of them that dwell therein The beasts and the birds
are consumed because they have said He shall not see our last end

125 If thou hast been wearied with running with footmen how canst
thou contend with horses and if thou hast been secure in a land of
peace what wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan

126 For even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they
have fought against thee and have cried after thee with full voice
believe them not when they speak good things to thee

127 I have forsaken my house I have left my inheritance I have
given my dear soul into the hand of her enemies

128 My inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood it hath
cried out against me therefore have I hated it

129 Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird is it as a bird dyed
throughout come ye assemble yourselves all ye beasts of the earth
make haste to devour

1210 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my
portion under foot they have changed my delightful portion into a
desolate wilderness

1211 They have laid it waste and it hath mourned for me With
desolation is all the land made desolate because there is none that
considereth in the heart

1212 The spoilers are come upon all the ways of the wilderness for
the sword of the Lord shall devour from one end of the land to the
other end thereof there is no peace for all flesh

1213 They have sown wheat and reaped thorns they have received an
inheritance and it shall not profit them you shall be ashamed of your
fruits because of the fierce wrath of the Lord

1214 Thus saith the Lord against all wicked neighbours that touch
the inheritance that I have shared out to my people Israel Behold I
will pluck them out of their land and I will pluck the house of Juda
out of the midst of them

1215 And when I shall have plucked them out I will return and have
mercy on them and will bring them back every man to his inheritance
and every man into his land

1216 And it shall come to pass if they will be taught and will
learn the ways of my people to swear by my name The Lord liveth as
they have taught my people to swear by Baal that they shall be built
up in the midst of my people

1217 But if they will not hear I will utterly pluck out and destroy
that nation saith the Lord



Jeremias Chapter 13


Under the figure of a linen girdle is foretold the destruction of the
Jews Their obstinacy in sin brings all miseries upon them

131 Thus saith the Lord to me Go and get thee a linen girdle and
thou shalt put it about thy loins and shalt not put it into water

132 And I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord and put it
about my loins

133 And the word of the Lord came to me the second time saying

134 Take the girdle which thou hast got which is about thy loins
and arise go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the
rock

135 And I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the Lord had
commanded me

136 And it came to pass after many days that the Lord said to me
Arise go to the Euphrates and take from thence the girdle which I
commanded thee to hide there

137 And I went to the Euphrates and digged and took the girdle out
of the place where I had hid it and behold the girdle was rotten so
that it was fit for no use

138 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

139 Thus saith the Lord After this manner will I make the pride of
Juda and the great pride of Jerusalem to rot

1310 This wicked people that will not hear my words and that walk
in the perverseness of their heart and have gone after strange gods to
serve them and to adore them and they shall be as this girdle which
is fit for no use

1311 For as the girdle sticketh close to the loins of a man so have
I brought close to me all the house of Israel and all the house of
Juda saith the Lord that they might be my people and for a name and
for a praise and for a glory but they would not hear

1312 Thou shalt speak therefore to them this word Thus saith the
Lord the God of Israel Every bottle shall be filled with wine And
they shall say to thee Do we not know that every bottle shall be
filled with wine

1313 And thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord Behold I will
fill all the inhabitants of this land and the kings of the race of
David that sit upon his throne and the priests and the prophets and
all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness

1314 And I will scatter them every man from his brother and fathers
and sons in like manner saith the Lord I will not spare and I will
not pardon nor will I have mercy but to destroy them

1315 Hear ye and give ear Be not proud for the Lord hath spoken

1316 Give ye glory to the Lord your God before it be dark and
before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains you shall look for
light and he will turn it into the shadow of death and into darkness

1317 But if you will not hear this my soul shall weep in secret for
your pride weeping it shall weep and my eyes shall run down with
tears because the flock of the Lord is carried away captive

1318 Say to the king and to the queen Humble yourselves sit down
for the crown of your glory is come down from your head

1319 The cities of the south are shut up and there is none to open
them all Juda is carried away captive with an entire captivity

1320 Lift up your eyes and see you that come from the north where
is the flock that is given thee thy beautiful cattle

1321 What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee for thou hast
taught them against thee and instructed them against thy own head
shall not sorrows lay hold on thee as a woman in labour

1322 And if thou shalt say in thy heart Why are these things come
upon me For the greatness of thy iniquity thy nakedness is
discovered the soles of thy feet are defiled

1323 If the Ethiopian can change his skin or the leopard his spots
you also may do well when you have learned evil

1324 And I will scatter them as stubble which is carried away by the
wind in the desert

1325 This is thy lot and the portion of thy measure from me saith
the Lord because thou hast forgotten me and hast trusted in
falsehood

1326 Wherefore I have also bared thy thighs against thy face and thy
shame hath appeared

1327 I have seen thy adulteries and thy neighing the wickedness of
thy fornication and thy abominations upon the hills in the field Woe
to thee Jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean after me how long yet



Jeremias Chapter 14


A grievous famine and the prophets prayer on that occasion Evils
denounced to false prophets The prophet mourns for his people

141 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias concerning the words
of the drought

142 Judea hath mourned and the gates thereof are fallen and are
become obscure on the ground and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up

143 The great ones sent their inferiors to the water they came to
draw they found no water they carried back their vessels empty they
were confounded and afflicted and covered their heads

144 For the destruction of the land because there came no rain upon
the earth the husbandman were confounded they covered their heads

145 Yea the hind also brought forth in the field and left it
because there was no grass

146 And the wild asses stood upon the rocks they snuffed up the wind
like dragons their eyes failed because there was no grass

147 If our iniquities have testified against us O Lord do thou it
for thy names sake for our rebellions are many we have sinned
against thee

148 O expectation of Israel the Saviour thereof in time of trouble
why wilt thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man
turning in to lodge

149 Why wilt thou be as a wandering man as a mighty man that cannot
save but thou O Lord art among us and thy name is called upon by
us forsake us not

1410 Thus saith the Lord to this people that have loved to move
their feet and have not rested and have not pleased the Lord He will
now remember their iniquities and visit their sins

1411 And the Lord said to me Pray not for this people for their
good

1412 When they fast I will not hear their prayers and if they offer
holocausts and victims I will not receive them for I will consume
them by the sword and by famine and by the pestilence

1413 And I said Ah ah ah O Lord God the prophets say to them
You shall not see the sword and there shall be no famine among you
but he will give you true peace in this place

1414 And the Lord said to me The prophets prophesy falsely in my
name I sent them not neither have I commanded them nor have I spoken
to them they prophesy unto you a lying vision and divination and
deceit and the seduction of their own heart

1415 Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that
prophesy in my name whom I did not send that say Sword and famine
shall not be in this land By sword and famine shall those prophets be
consumed

1416 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and there
shall be none to bury them they and their wives their sons and their
daughters and I will pour out their own wickedness upon them

1417 And thou shalt speak this word to them Let my eyes shed down
tears night and day and let them not cease because the virgin
daughter of my people is afflicted with a great affliction with an
exceeding grievous evil

1418 If I go forth into the fields behold the slain with the sword
and if I enter into the city behold them that are consumed with
famine The prophet also and the priest are gone into a land which they
knew not

1419 Hast thou utterly cast away Juda or hath thy soul abhorred
Sion why then hast thou struck us so that there is no healing for us
we have looked for peace and there is no good and for the time of
healing and behold trouble

1420 We acknowledge O Lord our wickedness the iniquities of our
fathers because we have sinned against thee

1421 Give us not to be a reproach for thy names sake and do not
disgrace in us the throne of thy glory remember break not thy
covenant with us

1422 Are there any among the graven things of the Gentiles that can
send rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou the Lord our
God whom we have looked for for thou hast made all these things



Jeremias Chapter 15


God is determined to punish the Jews for their sins The prophets
complaint and Gods promise to him

151 And the Lord said to me If Moses and Samuel shall stand before
me my soul is not towards this people cast them out from my sight
and let them go forth

152 And if they shall say unto thee Whither shall we go forth thou
shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord Such as are for death to
death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are for
famine to famine and such as are for captivity to captivity

153 And I will visit them with four kinds saith the Lord The sword
to kill and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the air and the beasts
of the earth to devour and to destroy

154 And I will give them up to the rage of all the kingdoms of the
earth because of Manasses the son of Ezechias the king of Juda for
all that he did in Jerusalem

155 For who shall have pity on thee O Jerusalem or who shall bemoan
thee or who shall go to pray for thy peace

156 Thou hast forsaken me saith the Lord thou art gone backward
and I will stretch out my hand against thee and I will destroy thee I
am weary of entreating thee

157 And I will scatter them with a fan in the gates of the land I
have killed and destroyed my people and yet they are not returned from
their ways

158 Their widows are multiplied unto me above the sand of the sea I
have brought upon them against the mother of the young man a spoiler at
noonday I have cast a terror on a sudden upon the cities

159 She that hath borne seven is become weak her soul hath fainted
away her sun is gone down while it was yet day she is confounded
and ashamed and the residue of them I will give up to the sword in the
sight of their enemies saith the Lord

1510 Woe is me my mother why hast thou borne me a man of strife a
man of contention to all the earth I have not lent on usury neither
hath any man lent to me on usury yet all curse me

1511 The Lord saith to me Assuredly it shall be well with thy
remnant assuredly I shall help thee in the time of affliction and in
the time of tribulation against the enemy

1512 Shall iron be allied with the iron from the north and the
brass

Shall iron be allied etc  Shall the iron that is the strength of
Juda stand against the stronger iron of the north that is of
Babylon or enter into an alliance upon equal footing with it No
certainly but it must be broken by it

1513 Thy riches and thy treasures I will give unto spoil for nothing
because of all thy sins even in all thy borders

1514 And I will bring thy enemies out of a land which thou knowest
not for a fire is kindled in my rage it shall burn upon you

1515 O Lord thou knowest remember me and visit me and defend me
from them that persecute me do not defend me in thy patience know
that for thy sake I have suffered reproach

Do not defend me in thy patience  That is let not thy patience and
longsuffering which thou usest towards sinners keep thee from making
haste to my assistance

1516 Thy words were found and I did eat them and thy word was to me
a joy and gladness of my heart for thy name is called upon me O Lord
God of hosts

1517 I sat not in the assembly of jesters nor did I make a boast of
the presence of thy hand I sat alone because thou hast filled me with
threats

1518 Why is my sorrow become perpetual and my wound desperate so as
to refuse to be healed it is become to me as the falsehood of
deceitful waters that cannot be trusted

1519 Therefore thus saith the Lord If thou wilt be converted I will
convert thee and thou shalt stand before my face and thou wilt
separate the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth they
shall be turned to thee and thou shalt not be turned to them

1520 And I will make thee to this people as a strong wall of brass
and they shall fight against thee and shall not prevail for I am with
thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the Lord

1521 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and I
will redeem thee out of the hand of the mighty



Jeremias Chapter 16


The prophet is forbid to marry The Jews shall be utterly ruined for
their idolatry but shall at length be released from their captivity
and the Gentiles shall be converted

161 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

162 Thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons and
daughters in this place

163 For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and daughters that
are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bore them
and concerning their fathers of whom they were born in this land

164 They shall die by the death of grievous illnesses they shall not
be lamented and they shall not be buried they shall be as dung upon
the face of the earth and they shall be consumed with the sword and
with famine and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of the
air and for the beasts of the earth

165 For thus saith the Lord Enter not into the house of feasting
neither go thou to mourn nor to comfort them because I have taken
away my peace from this people saith the Lord my mercy and
commiserations

166 Both the great and the little shall die in this land they shall
not be buried nor lamented and men shall not cut themselves nor make
themselves bald for them

167 And they shall not break bread among them to him that mourneth
to comfort him for the dead neither shall they give them for their
father and mother

168 And do not thou go into the house of feasting to sit with them
and to eat and drink

169 For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Behold I
will take away out of this place in your sight and in your days the
voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom
and the voice of the bride

1610 And when thou shalt tell this people all these words and they
shall say to thee Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced against us all
this great evil what is our iniquity and what is our sin that we
have sinned against the Lord our God

1611 Thou shalt say to them Because your fathers forsook me saith
the Lord and went after strange gods and served them and adored
them and they forsook me and kept not my law

1612 And you also have done worse than your fathers for behold every
one of you walketh after the perverseness of his evil heart so as not
to hearken to me

1613 So I will cast you forth out of this land into a land which you
know not nor your fathers and there you shall serve strange gods day
and night which shall not give you any rest

1614 Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord when it shall be
said no more The Lord liveth that brought forth the children of
Israel out of the land of Egypt

1615 But The Lord liveth that brought the children of Israel out of
the land of the north and out of all the lands to which I cast them
out and I will bring them again into their land which I gave to their
fathers

1616 Behold I will send many fishers saith the Lord and they shall
fish them and after this I will send them many hunters and they shall
hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes
of the rocks

1617 For my eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my
face and their iniquity hath not been hid from my eyes

1618 And I will repay first their double iniquities and their sins
because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their idols
and they have filled my inheritance with their abominations

1619 O Lord my might and my strength and my refuge in the day of
tribulation to thee the Gentiles shall come from the ends of the
earth and shall say Surely our fathers have possessed lies a vanity
which hath not profited them

1620 Shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods

1621 Therefore behold I will this once cause them to know I will
shew them my hand and my power and they shall know that my name is the
Lord



Jeremias Chapter 17


For their obstinacy in sin the Jews shall be led captive He is cursed
that trusteth in flesh God alone searcheth the heart giving to every
one as he deserves The prophet prayeth to be delivered from his
enemies and preacheth up the observance of the sabbath

171 The sin of Juda is written with a pen of iron with the point of
a diamond it is graven upon the table of their heart upon the horns
of their altars

172 When their children shall remember their altars and their
groves and their green trees upon the high mountains

173 Sacrificing in the field I will give thy strength and all thy
treasures to the spoil and thy high places for sin in all thy borders

174 And thou shalt be left stripped of thy inheritance which I gave
thee and I will make thee serve thy enemies in a land which thou
knowest not because thou hast kindled a fire in my wrath it shall
burn for ever

175 Thus saith the Lord Cursed be the man that trusteth in man and
maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the Lord

176 For he shall be like tamaric in the desert and he shall not see
when good shall come but he shall dwell in dryness in the desert in a
salt land and not inhabited

Tamaric  A barren shrub that grows in the driest parts of the
wilderness

177 Blessed be the man that trusteth in the Lord and the Lord shall
be his confidence

178 And he shall be as a tree that is planted by the waters that
spreadeth out its roots towards moisture and it shall not fear when
the heat cometh And the leaf thereof shall be green and in the time
of drought it shall not be solicitous neither shall it cease at any
time to bring forth fruit

179 The heart is perverse above all things and unsearchable who can
know it

1710 I am the Lord who search the heart and prove the reins who
give to every one according to his way and according to the fruit of
his devices

1711 As the partridge hath hatched eggs which she did not lay so is
he that hath gathered riches and not by right in the midst of his
days he shall leave them and in his latter end he shall be a fool

1712 A high and glorious throne from the beginning is the place of
our sanctification

1713 O Lord the hope of Israel all that forsake thee shall be
confounded they that depart from thee shall be written in the earth
because they have forsaken the Lord the vein of living waters

1714 Heal me O Lord and I shall be healed save me and I shall be
saved for thou art my praise

1715 Behold they say to me Where is the word of the Lord let it
come

1716 And I am not troubled following thee for my pastor and I have
not desired the day of man thou knowest That which went out of my
lips hath been right in thy sight

1717 Be not thou a terror unto me thou art my hope in the day of
affliction

1718 Let them be confounded that persecute me and let not me be
confounded let them be afraid and let not me be afraid bring upon
them the day of affliction and with a double destruction destroy
them

Let them be confounded etc  Such expressions as these in the
writings of the prophets are not to be understood as imprecations
proceeding from malice or desire of revenge but as prophetic
predictions of evils that were about to fall upon impenitent sinners
and approbations of the ways of divine justice

1719 Thus saith the Lord to me Go and stand in the gate of the
children of the people by which the kings of Juda come in and go out
and in all the gates of Jerusalem

1720 And thou shalt say to them Hear the word of the Lord ye kings
of Juda and al Juda and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem that enter
in by these gates

1721 Thus saith the Lord Take heed to your souls and carry no
burdens on the sabbath day and bring them not in by the gates of
Jerusalem

1722 And do not bring burdens out of your houses on the sabbath day
neither do ye any work sanctify the sabbath day as I commanded your
fathers

1723 But they did not hear nor incline their ear but hardened their
neck that they might not hear me and might not receive instruction

1724 And it shall come to pass if you will hearken to me saith the
Lord to bring in no burdens by the gates of this city on the sabbath
day and if you will sanctify the sabbath day to do no work therein

1725 Then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and
princes sitting upon the throne of David and riding in chariots and
on horses they and their princes the men of Juda and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem and this city shall be inhabited for ever

1726 And they shall come from the cities of Juda and from the places
round about Jerusalem and from the land of Benjamin and from the
plains and from the mountains and from the south bringing
holocausts and victims and sacrifices and frankincense and they
shall bring in an offering into the house of the Lord

1727 But if you will not hearken to me to sanctify the sabbath day
and not to carry burdens and not to bring them in by the gates of
Jerusalem on the sabbath day I will kindle a fire in the gates
thereof and it shall devour the houses of Jerusalem and it shall not
be quenched



Jeremias Chapter 18


As the clay in the hand of the potter so is Israel in Gods hand He
pardoneth penitents and punisheth the obstinate They conspire against
Jeremias for which he denounceth to them the miseries that hang over
them

181 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord saying

182 Arise and go down into the potters house and there thou shalt
hear my words

183 And I went down into the potters house and behold he was doing
a work on the wheel

184 And the vessel was broken which he was making of clay with his
hands and turning he made another vessel as it seemed good in his
eyes to make it

185 Then the word of the Lord came to me saying

186 Cannot I do with you as this potter O house of Israel saith
the Lord behold as clay is in the hand of the potter so are you in my
hand O house of Israel

187 I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom to
root out and to pull down and to destroy it

188 If that nation against which I have spoken shall repent of their
evil I also will repent of the evil that I have thought to do to them

189 And I will suddenly speak of a nation and of a kingdom to build
up and plant it

1810 If it shall do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice I
will repent of the good that I have spoken to do unto it

1811 Now therefore tell the men of Juda and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem saying Thus saith the Lord Behold I frame evil against
you and devise a device against you let every man of you return from
his evil way and make ye your ways and your doings good

1812 And they said We have no hopes for we will go after our own
thoughts and we will do every one according to the perverseness of his
evil heart

1813 Therefore thus saith the Lord Ask among the nations Who hath
heard such horrible things as the virgin of Israel hath done to
excess

1814 Shall the snow of Libanus fail from the rock of the field or
can the cold waters that gush out and run down be taken away

1815 Because my people have forgotten me sacrificing in vain and
stumbling in their ways in ancient paths to walk by them in a way not
trodden

1816 That their land might be given up to desolation and to a
perpetual hissing every one that shall pass by it shall be
astonished and wag his head

1817 As a burning wind will I scatter them before the enemy I will
shew them the back and not the face in the day of their destruction

1818 And they said Come and let us invent devices against Jeremias
for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the
wise nor the word from the prophet come and let us strike him with
the tongue and let us give no heed to all his words

1819 Give heed to me O Lord and hear the voice of my adversaries

1820 Shall evil be rendered for good because they have digged a pit
for my soul Remember that I have stood in thy sight to speak good for
them and to turn away thy indignation from them

Remember etc  This is spoken in the person of Christ persecuted by
the Jews and prophetically denouncing the evils that should fall upon
them in punishment of their crimes

1821 Therefore deliver up their children to famine and bring them
into the hands of the sword let their wives be bereaved of children
and widows and let their husbands be slain by death let their young
men be stabbed with the sword in battle

1822 Let a cry be heard out of their houses for thou shalt bring the
robber upon them suddenly because they have digged a pit to take me
and have hid snares for my feet

1823 But thou O Lord knowest all their counsel against me unto
death not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from
thy sight let them be overthrown before thy eyes in the time of thy
wrath do thou destroy them



Jeremias Chapter 19


Under the type of breaking a potters vessel the prophet foresheweth
the desolation of the Jews for their sins

191 Thus saith the Lord Go and take a potters earthen bottle and
take of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of the priests

192 And go forth into the valley of the son of Ennom which is by the
entry of the earthen gate and there thou shalt proclaim the words that
I shall tell thee

193 And thou shalt say Hear the word of the Lord O ye kings of
Juda and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem Thus saith the Lord of hosts
the God of Israel Behold I will bring an affliction upon this place
so that whosoever shall hear it his ears shall tingle

194 Because they have forsaken me and have profaned this place  and
have sacrificed therein to strange gods whom neither they nor their
fathers knew nor the kings of Juda and they have filled this place
with the blood of innocents

195 And they have built the high places of Baalim to burn their
children with fire for a holocaust to Baalim which I did not command
nor speak of neither did it once come into my mind

196 Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord that this place
shall no more be called Topheth nor the valley of the son of Ennom
but the valley of slaughter

197 And I will defeat the counsel of Juda and of Jerusalem in this
place and I will destroy them with the sword in the sight of their
enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and I will
give their carcasses to be meat for the fowls of the air and for the
beasts of the earth

198 And I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing every
one that shall pass by it shall be astonished and shall hiss because
of all the plagues thereof

199 And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons and with the
flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of his
friend in the siege and in the distress wherewith their enemies and
they that seek their lives shall straiten them

1910 And thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men that
shall go with thee

1911 And thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord of hosts Even
so will I break this people and this city as the potters vessel is
broken which cannot be made whole again and they shall be buried in
Topheth because there is no other place to bury in

1912 Thus will I do to this place saith the Lord and to the
inhabitants thereof and I will make this city as Topheth

1913 And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Juda
shall be unclean as the place of Topheth all the houses upon whose
roofs they have sacrificed to all the host of heaven and have poured
out drink offerings to strange gods

1914 Then Jeremias came from Topheth whither the Lord had sent him
to prophesy and he stood in the court of the house of the Lord and
said to all the people

1915 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will
bring in upon this city and upon all the cities thereof all the evils
that I have spoken against it because they have hardened their necks
that they might not hear my words



Jeremias Chapter 20


The prophet is persecuted he denounces captivity to his persecutors
and bemoans himself

201 Now Phassur the son of Emmer the priest who was appointed chief
in the house of the Lord heard Jeremias prophesying these words

202 And Phassur struck Jeremias the prophet and put him in the
stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin in the house of the
Lord

203 And when it was light the next day Phassur brought Jeremias out
of the stocks And Jeremias said to him The Lord hath not called thy
name Phassur but fear on every side

Phassur  This name signifies increase and principality and therefore
is here changed to MagorMissabib or fear on every side to denote the
evils that should come upon him in punishment of his opposing the word
of God

204 For thus saith the Lord Behold I will deliver thee up to fear
thee and all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of their
enemies and thy eyes shall see it and I will give all Juda into the
hand of the king of Babylon and he shall carry them away to Babylon
and shall strike them with the sword

205 And I will give all the substance of this city and all its
labour and every precious thing thereof and all the treasures of the
kings of Juda will I give into the hands of their enemies and they
shall pillage them and take them away and carry them to Babylon

206 But thou Phassur and all that dwell in thy house shall go into
captivity and thou shalt go to Babylon and there thou shalt die and
there thou shalt be buried thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast
prophesied a lie

207 Thou hast deceived me O Lord and I am deceived thou hast been
stronger than I and thou hast prevailed I am become a laughingstock
all the day all scoff at me

Thou hast deceived etc  The meaning of the prophet is not to charge
God with any untruth but what he calls deceiving was only the
concealing from him when he accepted of the prophetical commission
the greatness of the evils which the execution of that commission was
to bring upon him

208 For I am speaking now this long time crying out against
iniquity and I often proclaim devastation and the word of the Lord is
made a reproach to me and a derision all the day

209 Then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak any more
in his name and there came in my heart as a burning fire shut up in
my bones and I was wearied not being able to bear it

2010 For I heard the reproaches of many and terror on every side
Persecute him and let us persecute him from all the men that were my
familiars and continued at my side if by any means he may be
deceived and we may prevail against him and be revenged on him

2011 But the Lord is with me as a strong warrior therefore they that
persecute me shall fall and shall be weak they shall be greatly
confounded because they have not understood the everlasting reproach
which never shall be effaced

2012 And thou O Lord of hosts prover of the just who seest the
reins and the heart let me see I beseech thee thy vengeance on them
for to thee I have laid open my cause

Let me see etc  This prayer proceeded not from hatred or ill will
but zeal of justice

2013 Sing ye to the Lord praise the Lord because he hath delivered
the soul of the poor out of the hand of the wicked

2014 Cursed be the day wherein I was born let not the day in which
my mother bore me be blessed

Cursed be the day etc  In these and the following words of the
prophet there is a certain figure of speech to express with more
energy the greatness of the evils to which his birth had exposed him

2015 Cursed be the man that brought the tidings to my father saying
A man child is born to thee and made him greatly rejoice

2016 Let that man be as the cities which the Lord hath overthrown
and hath not repented let him hear a cry in the morning and howling
at noontide

2017 Who slew me not from the womb that my mother might have been my
grave and her womb an everlasting conception

2018 Why came I out of the womb to see labour and sorrow and that
my days should be spent in confusion



Jeremias Chapter 21


The prophets answer to the messengers of Sedecias when Jerusalem was
besieged

211 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord when king Sedecias
sent unto him Phassur the son of Melchias and Sophonias the son of
Maasias the priest saying

212 Inquire of the Lord for us for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon
maketh war against us if so be the Lord will deal with us according to
all his wonderful works that he may depart from us

213 And Jeremias said to them Thus shall you say to Sedecias

214 Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel Behold I will turn back
the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you fight
against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans that besiege you round
about the walls and I will gather them together in the midst of this
city

215 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand
and with a strong arm and in fury and in indignation and in great
wrath

216 And I will strike the inhabitants of this city men and beasts
shall die of a great pestilence

217 And after this saith the Lord I will give Sedecias the king of
Juda and his servants and his people and such as are left in this
city from the pestilence and the sword and the famine into the hand
of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon and into the hand of their
enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and he shall
strike them with the edge of the sword and he shall not be moved to
pity nor spare them nor shew mercy to them

218 And to this people thou shalt say Thus saith the Lord Behold I
set before you the way of life and the way of death

219 He that shall abide in this city shall die by the sword and by
the famine and by the pestilence but he that shall go out and flee
over to the Chaldeans that besiege you shall live and his life shall
be to him as a spoil

2110 For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for
good saith the Lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of
Babylon and he shall burn it with fire

2111 And to the house of the king of Juda Hear ye the word of the
Lord

2112 O house of David thus saith the Lord Judge ye judgment in the
morning and deliver him that is oppressed by violence out of the hand
of the oppressor lest my indignation go forth like a fire and be
kindled and there be none to quench it because of the evil of your
ways

2113 Behold I come to thee that dwellest in a valley upon a rock
above a plain saith the Lord and you say Who shall strike us and who
shall enter into our houses

To thee that dwellest etc  He speaks to Jerusalem confiding in the
strength of her situation upon rocks surrounded with a deep valley

2114 But I will visit upon you according to the fruit of your doings
saith the Lord and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof and it
shall devour all things round about it



Jeremias Chapter 22


An exhortation both to king and people to return of God The sentence
of God upon Joachaz Joakim and Jechonias

221 Thus saith the Lord Go down to the house of the king of Juda
and there thou shalt speak this word

Go down etc  The contents of this chapter are of a more ancient date
than those of the foregoing chapter for the order of time is not
always observed in the writings of the prophets

222 And thou shalt say Hear the word of the Lord king of Juda that
sittest upon the throne of David thou and thy servants and thy
people who enter in by these gates

223 Thus saith the Lord Execute judgment and justice and deliver
him that is oppressed out of the hand of the oppressor and afflict not
the stranger the fatherless and the widow nor oppress them unjustly
and shed not innocent blood in this place

224 For if you will do this thing indeed then shall there enter in
by the gates of this house kings of the race of David sitting upon his
throne and riding in chariots and on horses they and their servants
and their people

225 But if you will not hearken to these words I swear by myself
saith the Lord that this house shall become a desolation

226 For thus saith the Lord to the house of the king of Juda Thou
art to me Galaad the head of Libanus yet surely I will make thee a
wilderness and cities not habitable

Galaad the head of Libanus  By Galaad a rich and fruitful country
is here signified the royal palace of the kings of the house of David
by Libanus a high mountain abounding in cedar trees the populous city
of Jerusalem

227 And I will prepare against thee the destroyer and his weapons
and they shall cut down thy chosen cedars and shall cast them headlong
into the fire

Prepare  Literally sanctify

228 And many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say
every man to his neighbour Why hath the Lord done so to this great
city

229 And they shall answer Because they have forsaken the covenant of
the Lord their God and have adored strange gods and served them

2210 Weep not for him that is dead nor bemoan him with your tears
lament him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his
native country

Weep not for him that is dead etc  He means the good king Josias
who by death was taken away so as not to see the miseries of his
countryIbid Him that goeth away  Viz sellum alias Joachaz who
was carried captive into Egypt

2211 For thus saith the Lord to Sellum the son of Josias the king of
Juda who reigned instead of his father who went forth out of this
place He shall return hither no more

2212 But in the place to which I have removed him there shall he
die and he shall not see this land any more

2213 Woe to him that buildeth up his house by injustice and his
chambers not in judgment that will oppress his friend without cause
and will not pay him his wages

2214 Who saith I will build me a wide house and large chambers who
openeth to himself windows and maketh roofs of cedar and painteth
them with vermilion

2215 Shalt thou reign because thou comparest thyself to the cedar
did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and it
was then well with him

2216 He judged the cause of the poor and needy for his own good was
it not therefore because he knew me saith the Lord

2217 But thy eyes and thy heart are set upon covetousness and upon
shedding innocent blood and upon oppression and running after evil
works

2218 Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Joakim the son of
Josias king of Juda They shall not mourn for him Alas my brother
and Alas sister they shall not lament for him Alas my lord or
Alas the noble one

2219 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass rotten and cast
forth without the gates of Jerusalem

2220 Go up to Libanus and cry and lift up thy voice in Basan and
cry to them that pass by for all thy lovers are destroyed

2221 I spoke to thee in thy prosperity and thou saidst I will not
hear this hath been thy way from thy youth because thou hast not
heard my voice

2222 The wind shall feed all thy pastors and thy lovers shall go
into captivity and then shalt thou be confounded and ashamed of all
thy wickedness

2223 Thou that sittest in Libanus and makest thy nest in the cedars
how hast thou mourned when sorrows came upon thee as the pains of a
woman in labour

2224 As I live saith the Lord if Jechonias the son of Joakim the
king of Juda were a ring on my right hand I would pluck him thence

2225 And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life
and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest and into the hand of
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans

2226 And I will send thee and thy mother that bore thee into a
strange country in which you were not born and there you shall die

2227 And they shall not return into the land whereunto they lift up
their mind to return thither

2228 Is this man Jechonias an earthen and a broken vessel is he a
vessel wherein is no pleasure why are they cast out he and his seed
and are cast into a land which they know not

2229 O earth earth earth hear the word of the Lord

2230 Thus saith the Lord Write this man barren a man that shall not
prosper in his days for there shall not be a man of his seed that
shall sit upon the throne of David and have power any more in Juda

Write this man barren  That is childless not that he had no
children but that his children should never sit on the throne of Juda



Jeremias Chapter 23


God reproves evil governors and promises to send good pastors and
Christ himself the prince of the pastors He inveighs against false
prophets preaching without being sent

231 Woe to the pastors that destroy and tear the sheep of my
pasture saith the Lord

232 Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to the pastors
that feed my people You have scattered my flock and driven them away
and have not visited them behold I will visit upon you for the evil of
your doings saith the Lord

233 And I will gather together the remnant of my flock out of all
the lands into which I have cast them out and I will make them return
to their own fields and they shall increase and be multiplied

234 And I will set up pastors over them and they shall feed them
they shall fear no more and they shall not be dismayed and none shall
be wanting of their number saith the Lord

235 Behold the days come saith the Lord and I will raise up to
David a just branch and a king shall reign and shall be wise and
shall execute judgment and justice in the earth

236 In those days shall Juda be saved and Israel shall dwell
confidently and this is the name that they shall call him The Lord
our just one

237 Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord and they shall
say no more The Lord liveth who brought up the children of Israel out
of the land of Egypt

238 But The Lord liveth who hath brought out and brought hither
the seed of the house of Israel from the land of the north and out of
all the lands to which I had cast them forth and they shall dwell in
their own land

239 To the prophets My heart is broken within me all my bones
tremble I am become as a drunken man and as a man full of wine at
the presence of the Lord and at the presence of his holy words

2310 Because the land is full of adulterers because the land hath
mourned by reason of cursing the fields of the desert are dried up
and their course is become evil and their strength unlike

2311 For the prophet and the priest are defiled and in my house I
have found their wickedness saith the Lord

2312 Therefore their way shall be as a slippery way in the dark for
they shall be driven on and fall therein for I will bring evils upon
them the year of their visitation saith the Lord

2313 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria they
prophesied in Baal and deceived my people Israel

2314 And I have seen the likeness of adulterers and the way of lying
in the prophets of Jerusalem and they strengthened the hands of the
wicked that no man should return from his evil doings they are all
become unto me as Sodom and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrha

2315 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts to the prophets Behold I
will feed them with wormwood and will give them gall to drink for
from the prophets of Jerusalem corruption is gone forth into all the
land

2316 Thus saith the Lord of hosts Hearken not to the words of the
prophets that prophesy to you and deceive you they speak a vision of
their own heart and not out of the mouth of the Lord

2317 They say to them that blaspheme me The Lord hath said You
shall have peace and to every one that walketh in the perverseness of
his own heart they have said No evil shall come upon you

2318 For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord and hath seen and
heard his word Who hath considered his word and heard it

2319 Behold the whirlwind of the Lords indignation shall come forth
and a tempest shall break out and come upon the head of the wicked

2320 The wrath of the Lord shall not return till he execute it and
till he accomplish the thought of his heart in the latter days you
shall understand his counsel

2321 I did not send prophets yet they ran I have not spoken to
them yet they prophesied

2322 If they had stood in my counsel and had made my words known to
my people I should have turned them from their evil way and from
their wicked doings

2323 Am I think ye a God at hand saith the Lord and not a God
afar off

2324 Shall a man be hid in secret places and I not see him saith
the Lord do not I fill heaven and earth saith the Lord

2325 I have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my
name and say I have dreamed I have dreamed

2326 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that
prophesy lies and that prophesy the delusions of their own heart

2327 Who seek to make my people forget my name through their dreams
which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers forgot my
name for Baal

2328 The prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that
hath my word let him speak my word with truth what hath the chaff to
do with the wheat saith the Lord

2329 Are not my words as a fire saith the Lord and as a hammer that
breaketh the rock in pieces

2330 Therefore behold I am against the prophets saith the Lord who
steal my words every one from his neighbour

2331 Behold I am against the prophets saith the Lord who use their
tongues and say The Lord saith it

2332 Behold I am against the prophets that have lying dreams saith
the Lord and tell them and cause my people to err by their lying and
by their wonders when I sent them not nor commanded them who have
not profited this people at all saith the Lord

2333 If therefore this people or the prophet or the priest shall
ask thee saying What is the burden of the Lord thou shalt say to
them You are the burden for I will cast you away saith the Lord

2334 And as for the prophet and the priest and the people that
shall say The burden of the Lord I will visit upon that man and upon
his house

Burden of the Lord  This expression is here rejected and disallowed
at least for those times because it was then used in mockery and
contempt by the false prophets and unbelieving people who ridiculed
the repeated threats of Jeremias under the name of his burdens

2335 Thus shall you say every one to his neighbour and to his
brother What hath the Lord answered and what hath the Lord spoken

2336 And the burden of the Lord shall be mentioned no more for every
mans word shall be his burden for you have perverted the words of the
living God of the Lord of hosts our God

2337 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet What hath the Lord answered
thee and what hath the Lord spoken

2338 But if you shall say The burden of the Lord therefore thus
saith the Lord Because you have said this word The burden of the
Lord and I have sent to you saying Say not The burden of the Lord

2339 Therefore behold I will take you away carrying you and will
forsake you and the city which I gave to you and to your fathers out
of my presence

Out of my presence  That is the Lord declares that out of his
presence he will cast them and bring them to captivity for their
transgressions

2340 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a
perpetual shame which shall never be forgotten



Jeremias Chapter 24


Under the type of good and bad figs he foretells the restoration of
the Jews that had been carried away captive with Jechonias and the
desolation of those that were left behind

241 The Lord shewed me and behold two baskets full of figs set
before the temple of the Lord after that Nabuchodonosor king of
Babylon had carried away Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda
and his chief men and the craftsmen and engravers of Jerusalem and
had brought them to Babylon

242 One basket had very good figs like the figs of the first season
and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten
because they were bad

243 And the Lord said to me What seest thou Jeremias And I said
Figs the good figs very good and the bad figs very bad which
cannot be eaten because they are bad

244 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

245 Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel Like these good figs so
will I regard the captives of Juda whom I have sent forth out of this
place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good

246 And I will set my eyes upon them to be pacified and I will bring
them again into this land and I will build them up and not pull them
down and I will plant them and not pluck them up

247 And I will give them a heart to know me that I am the Lord and
they shall be my people and I will be their God because they shall
return to me with their whole heart

248 And as the very bad figs that cannot be eaten because they are
bad thus saith the Lord So will I give Sedecias the king of Juda and
his princes and the residue of Jerusalem that have remained in this
city and that dwell in the land of Egypt

249 And I will deliver them up to vexation and affliction to all
the kingdoms of the earth to be a reproach and a byword and a
proverb and to be a curse in all places to which I have cast them
out

2410 And I will send among them the sword and the famine and the
pestilence till they be consumed out of the land which I gave to them
and their fathers



Jeremias Chapter 25


The prophet foretells the seventy years captivity after that the
destruction of Babylon and other nations

251 The word that came to Jeremias concerning all the people of Juda
in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda the same
is the first year of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon

252 Which Jeremias the prophet spoke to all the people of Juda and
to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying

253 From the thirteenth year of Josias the son of Ammon king of Juda
until this day this is the three and twentieth year the word of the
Lord hath come to me and I have spoken to you rising before day and
speaking and you have not hearkened

254 And the Lord hath sent to you all his servants the prophets
rising early and sending and you have not hearkened nor inclined
your ears to hear

255 When he said Return ye every one from his evil way and from
your wicked devices and you shall dwell in the land which the Lord
hath given to you and your fathers for ever and ever

256 And go not after strange gods to serve them and adore them nor
provoke me to wrath by the works of your hands and I will not afflict
you

257 And you have not heard me saith the Lord that you might provoke
me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt

258 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts Because you have not
heard my words

259 Behold I will send and take all the kindreds of the north saith
the Lord and Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon my servant and I will
bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and
against all the nations that are round about it and I will destroy
them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and perpetual
desolations

My servant  So this wicked king is here called because God made him
his instrument in punishing the sins of his people

2510 And I will take away from them the voice of mirth and the voice
of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride
the sound of the mill and the light of the lamp

2511 And all this land shall be a desolation and an astonishment
and all these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years

2512 And when the seventy years shall be expired I will punish the
king of Babylon and that nation saith the Lord for their iniquity
and the land of the Chaldeans and I will make it perpetual
desolations

Punish  Literally visit upon

2513 And I will bring upon that land all my words that I have spoken
against it all that is written in this book all that Jeremias hath
prophesied against all nations

2514 For they have served them whereas they were many nations and
great kings and I will repay them according to their deeds and
according to the works of their hands

2515 For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Take the cup
of wine of this fury at my hand and thou shalt make all the nations to
drink thereof into which I shall send thee

2516 And they shall drink and be troubled and be mad because of the
sword which I shall send among them

2517 And I took the cup at the hand of the Lord and I presented it
to all the nations to drink of it to which the Lord sent me

2518 To wit Jerusalem and the cities of Juda and the kings
thereof and the princes thereof to make them a desolation and an
astonishment and a hissing and a curse as it is at this day

2519 Pharao the king of Egypt and his servants and his princes and
all his people

2520 And all in general all the kings of the land of Ausitis and
all the kings of the land of the Philistines and Ascalon and Gaza
and Accaron and the remnant of Azotus

2521 And Edom and Moab and the children of Ammon

2522 And all the kings of Tyre and all the kings of Sidon and the
kings of the land of the islands that are beyond the sea

2523 And Dedan and Thema and Buz and all that have their hair cut
round

2524 And all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the west that
dwell in the desert

2525 And all the kings of Zambri and all the kings of Elam and all
the kings of the Medes

2526 And all the kings of the north far and near every one against
his brother and all the kingdoms of the earth which are upon the face
thereof and the king of Sesac shall drink after them

Sesac  That is Babel or Babylon which after bringing all these
people under her yoke should quickly fall and be destroyed herself

2527 And thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God
of Israel Drink ye and be drunken and vomit and fall and rise no
more because of the sword which I shall send among you

2528 And if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink thou
shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord of hosts Drinking you shall
drink

2529 For behold I begin to bring evil on the city wherein my name is
called upon and shall you be as innocent and escape free you shall
not escape free for I will call for the sword upon all the inhabitants
of the earth saith the Lord of hosts

2530 And thou shalt prophesy unto them all these words and thou
shalt say to them I The Lord shall roar from on high and shall utter
his voice from his holy habitation roaring he shall roar upon the
place of his beauty the shout as it were of them that tread grapes
shall be given out against all the inhabitants of the earth

2531 The noise is come even to the ends of the earth for the Lord
entereth into judgment with the nations he entereth into judgment with
all flesh the wicked I have delivered up to the sword saith the Lord

2532 Thus saith the Lord of hosts Behold evil shall go forth from
nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall go forth from the ends of
the earth

2533 And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of
the earth even to the other end thereof they shall not be lamented
and they shall not be gathered up nor buried they shall lie as dung
upon the face of the earth

2534 Howl ye shepherds and cry and sprinkle yourselves with ashes
ye leaders of the flock for the days of your slaughter and your
dispersion are accomplished and you shall fall like precious vessels

2535 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the leaders of
the flock to save themselves

2536 A voice of the cry of the shepherds and a howling of the
principal of the flock because the Lord hath wasted their pastures

2537 And the fields of peace have been silent because of the fierce
anger of the Lord

2538 He hath forsaken his covert as the lion for the land is laid
waste because of the wrath of the dove and because of the fierce anger
of the Lord

The dove  This is commonly understood of Nabuchodonosor whose
military standard it is said was a dove But the Hebrew word Jonah
which is here rendered a dove may also signify a waster or oppressor
which name better agrees to that unmerciful prince or by comparison
as a doves flight is the swiftest so would their destruction come
upon them



Jeremias Chapter 26


The prophet is apprehended and accused by the priests but discharged
by the princes

261 In the beginning of the reign of Joakim the son of Josias king of
Juda came this word from the Lord saying

262 Thus saith the Lord stand in the court of the house of the Lord
and speak to all the cities of Juda out of which they come to adore
in the house of the Lord all the words which I have commanded thee to
speak unto them leave not out one word

263 If so be they will hearken and be converted every one from his
evil way that I may repent me of the evil that I think to do unto them
for the wickedness of their doings

264 And thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord If you will not
hearken to me to walk in my law which I have given you

265 To give ear to the words of my servants the prophets whom I sent
to you rising up early and sending and you have not hearkened

266 I will make this house like Silo and I will make this city a
curse to all the nations of the earth

267 And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard
Jeremias speaking these words in the house of the Lord

268 And when Jeremias had made an end of speaking all that the Lord
had commanded him to speak to all the people the priests and the
prophets and all the people laid hold on him saying Let him be put
to death

269 Why hath he prophesied in the name of the Lord saying This
house shall be like Silo and this city shall be made desolate without
an inhabitant And all the people were gathered together against
Jeremias in the house of the Lord

2610 And the princes of Juda heard these words and they went up from
the kings house into the house of the Lord and sat in the entry of
the new gate of the house of the Lord

2611 And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to
all the people saying The judgment of death is for this man because
he hath prophesied against this city as you have heard with your ears

2612 Then Jeremias spoke to all the princes and to all the people
saying The Lord sent me to prophesy concerning this house and
concerning this city all the words that you have heard

2613 Now therefore amend your ways and your doings and hearken to
the voice of the Lord your God and the Lord will repent him of the
evil that he hath spoken against you

2614 But as for me behold I am in your hands do with me what is
good and right in your eyes

2615 But know ye and understand that if you put me to death you
will shed innocent blood against your own selves and against this
city and the inhabitants thereof For in truth the Lord sent me to
you to speak all these words in your hearing

2616 Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to
the prophets There is no judgment of death for this man for he hath
spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God

2617 And some of the ancients of the land rose up and they spoke to
all the assembly of the people saying

2618 Micheas of Morasthi was a prophet in the days of Ezechias king
of Juda and he spoke to all the people of Juda saying Thus saith the
Lord of hosts Sion shall be ploughed like a field and Jerusalem shall
be a heap of stones and the mountain of the house the high places of
woods

2619 Did Ezechias king of Juda and all Juda condemn him to death
did they not fear the Lord and beseech the face of the Lord and the
Lord repented of the evil that he had spoken against them therefore we
are doing a great evil against our souls

2620 There was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord
Urias the son of Semei of Cariathiarim and he prophesied against this
city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremias

2621 And Joakim and all his men in power and his princes heard
these words and the king sought to put him to death And Urias heard
it and was afraid and fled and went into Egypt

2622 And king Joakim sent men into Egypt Elnathan the son of
Achobor and men with him into Egypt

2623 And they brought Urias out of Egypt and brought him to king
Joakim and he slew him with the sword and he cast his dead body into
the graves of the common people

2624 So the hand of Ahicam the son of Saphan was with Jeremias that
he should not be delivered into the hands of the people to put him to
death



Jeremias Chapter 27


The prophet sends chains to divers kings signifying that they must
bend their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon The vessels of
the temple shall not be brought back till all the rest are carried
away

271 In the beginning of the reign of Joakim the son of Josias king of
Juda this word came to Jeremias from the Lord saying

Joakim  This revelation was made to the prophet in the beginning of
the reign of Joakim but the bands were not sent to the princes here
named before the reign of Sedecias ver 3

272 Thus saith the Lord to me Make thee bands and chains and thou
shalt put them on thy neck

273 And thou shalt send them to the king of Edom and to the king of
Moab and to the king of the children of Ammon and to the king of
Tyre and to the king of Sidon by the hand of the messengers that are
come to Jerusalem to Sedecias the king of Juda

274 And thou shalt command them to speak to their masters Thus saith
the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Thus shall you say to your
masters

275 I made the earth and the men and the beasts that are upon the
face of the earth by my great power and by my stretched out arm and
I have given it to whom it seemed good in my eyes

276 And now I have given all these lands into the hand of
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon my servant moreover also the beasts of
the field I have given him to serve him

277 And all nations shall serve him and his son and his sons son
till the time come for his land and himself and many nations and great
kings shall serve him

His son  Viz Evilmerodach and his sons son Nabonydus or
Nabonadius the Baltassar of Daniel chap 5 and the last of the
Chaldean kings

278 But the nation and kingdom that will not serve Nabuchodonosor
king of Babylon and whosoever will not bend his neck under the yoke of
the king of Babylon I will visit upon that nation with the sword and
with famine and with pestilence saith the Lord till I consume them
by his hand

279 Therefore hearken not to your prophets and diviners and
dreamers and soothsayers and sorcerers that say to you You shall
not serve the king of Babylon

2710 For they prophesy lies to you to remove you far from your
country and cast you out and to make you perish

2711 But the nation that shall bend down their neck under the yoke of
the king of Babylon and shall serve him I will let them remain in
their own land saith the Lord and they shall till it and dwell in
it

2712 And I spoke to Sedecias the king of Juda according to all these
words saying Bend down your necks under the yoke of the king of
Babylon and serve him and his people and you shall live

2713 Why will you die thou and thy people by the sword and by
famine and by the pestilence as the Lord hath spoken against the
nation that will not serve the king of Babylon

2714 Hearken not to the words of the prophets that say to you You
shall not serve the king of Babylon for they tell you a lie

2715 For I have not sent them saith the Lord and they prophesy in
my name falsely to drive you out and that you may perish both you
and the prophets that prophesy to you

2716 I spoke also to the priests and to this people saying Thus
saith the Lord Hearken not to the words of your prophets that
prophesy to you saying Behold the vessels of the Lord shall now in a
short time be brought again from Babylon for they prophesy a lie unto
you

2717 Therefore hearken not to them but serve the king of Babylon
that you may live Why should this city be given up to desolation

2718 But if they be prophets and the word of the Lord be in them
let them interpose themselves before the Lord of hosts that the
vessels which were left in the house of the Lord and in the house of
the king of Juda and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon

2719 For thus saith the Lord of hosts to the pillars and to the sea
and to the bases and to the rest of the vessels that remain in this
city

2720 Which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon did not take when he
carried away Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda from
Jerusalem to Babylon and all the great men of Juda and Jerusalem

2721 For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel to the
vessels that are left in the house of the Lord and in the house of the
king of Juda and Jerusalem

2722 They shall be carried to Babylon and there they shall be until
the day of their visitation saith the Lord and I will cause them to
be brought and to be restored in this place



Jeremias Chapter 28


The false prophecy of Hananias he dies that same year as Jeremias
foretold

281 And it came to pass in that year in the beginning of the reign
of Sedecias king of Juda in the fourth year in the fifth month that
Hananias the son of Azur a prophet of Gabaon spoke to me in the house
of the Lord before the priests and all the people saying

282 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel I have broken the
yoke of the king of Babylon

283 As yet two years of days and I will cause all the vessels of the
house of the Lord to be brought back into this place which
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon took away from this place and carried
them to Babylon

284 And I will bring back to this place Jechonias the son of Joakim
king of Juda and all the captives of Juda that are gone to Babylon
saith the Lord for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon

285 And Jeremias the prophet said to Hananias the prophet in the
presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that
stood in the house of the Lord

286 And Jeremias the prophet said Amen the Lord do so the Lord
perform thy words which thou hast prophesied that the vessels may be
brought again into the house of the Lord and all the captives may
return out of Babylon to this place

287 Nevertheless hear this word that I speak in thy ears and in the
ears of all the people

288 The prophets that have been before me and before thee from the
beginning and have prophesied concerning many countries and
concerning great kingdoms of war and of affliction and of famine

289 The prophet that prophesied peace when his word shall come to
pass the prophet shall be known whom the hath sent in truth

2810 And Hananias the prophet took the chain from the neck of
Jeremias the prophet and broke it

2811 And Hananias spoke in the presence of all the people saying
Thus saith the Lord Even so will I break the yoke of Nabuchodonosor
the king of Babylon after two full years from off the neck of all the
nations

2812 And Jeremias the prophet went his way And the word of the Lord
came to Jeremias after that Hananias the prophet had broken the chain
from off the neck of Jeremias the prophet saying

2813 Go and tell Hananias Thus saith the Lord Thou hast broken
chains of wood and thou shalt make for them chains of iron

2814 For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel I have put a
yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations to serve
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon and they shall serve him moreover also
I have given him the beasts of the earth

2815 And Jeremias the prophet said to Hananias the prophet Hear now
Hananias the Lord hath not sent thee and thou hast made this people
to trust in a lie

2816 Therefore thus saith the Lord Behold I will send thee away from
off the face of the earth this year shalt thou die for thou hast
spoken against the Lord

2817 And Hananias the prophet died in that year in the seventh
month



Jeremias Chapter 29


Jeremias writeth to the captives in Babylon exhorting them to be easy
there and not to hearken to false prophets That they shall be
delivered after seventy years But those that remain in Jerusalem shall
perish by the sword famine and pestilence And that Achab Sedecias
and Semeias false prophets shall die miserably

291 Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremias the prophet
sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the ancients that were carried
into captivity and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the
people whom Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon

292 After that Jechonias the king and the queen and the eunuchs
and the princes of Juda and of Jerusalem and the craftsmen and the
engravers were departed out of Jerusalem

293 By the hand of Elasa the son of Saphan and Gamarias the son of
Helcias whom Sedecias king of Juda sent to Babylon to Nabuchodonosor
king of Babylon saying

294 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel to all that are
carried away captives whom I have caused to be carried away from
Jerusalem to Babylon

295 Build ye houses and dwell in them and plant orchards and eat
the fruit of them

296 Take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for
your sons and give your daughters to husbands and let them bear sons
and daughters and be ye multiplied there and be not few in number

297 And seek the peace of the city to which I have caused you to be
carried away captives and pray to the Lord for it for in the peace
thereof shall be your peace

298 For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Let not your
prophets that are in the midst of you and your diviners deceive you
and give no heed to your dreams which you dream

299 For they prophesy falsely to you in my name and I have not sent
them saith the Lord

2910 For thus saith the Lord When the seventy years shall begin to
be accomplished in Babylon I will visit you and I will perform my
good word in your favour to bring you again to this place

2911 For I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the
Lord thoughts of peace and not of affliction to give you an end and
patience

2912 And you shall call upon me and you shall go and you shall pray
to me and I will hear you

2913 You shall seek me and shall find me when you shall seek me
with all your heart

2914 And I will be found by you saith the Lord and I will bring
back your captivity and I will gather you out of all nations and from
all the places to which I have driven you out saith the Lord and I
will bring you back from the place to which I caused you to be carried
away captive

2915 Because you have said The Lord hath raised us up prophets in
Babylon

2916 For thus saith the Lord to the king that sitteth upon the throne
of David and to all the people that dwell in this city to your
brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity

2917 Thus saith the Lord of hosts Behold I will send upon them the
sword and the famine and the pestilence and I will make them like
bad figs that cannot be eaten because they are very bad

2918 And I will persecute them with the sword and with famine and
with the pestilence and I will give them up unto affliction to all the
kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and a
hissing and a reproach to all the nations to which I have driven them
out

2919 Because they have not hearkened to my words saith the Lord
which I sent to them by my servants the prophets rising by night and
sending and you have not heard saith the Lord

2920 Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord all ye of the captivity
whom I have sent out from Jerusalem to Babylon

2921 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel to Achab the son
of Colias and to Sedecias the son of Maasias who prophesy unto you in
my name falsely Behold I will deliver them up into the hands of
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon and he shall kill them before your
eyes

2922 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of
Juda that are in Babylon saying The Lord make thee like Sedecias
and like Achab whom the king of Babylon fried in the fire

2923 Because they have acted folly in Israel and have committed
adultery with the wives of their friends and have spoken lying words
in my name which I commanded them not I am the judge and the witness
saith the Lord

2924 And to Semeias the Nehelamite thou shalt say

2925 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Because thou
hast sent letters in thy name to all the people that are in Jerusalem
and to Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest and to all the priests
saying

2926 The Lord hath made thee priest instead of Joiada the priest
that thou shouldst be ruler in the house of the Lord over every man
that raveth and prophesieth to put him in the stocks and into prison

2927 And now why hast thou not rebuked Jeremias the Anathothite who
prophesieth to you

2928 For he hath also sent to us in Babylon saying It is a long
time build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat
the fruits of them

2929 So Sophonias the priest read this letter in the hearing of
Jeremias the prophet

2930 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias saying

2931 Send to all them of the captivity saying Thus saith the Lord
to Semeias the Nehelamite Because Semeias hath prophesied to you and
I sent him not and hath caused you to trust in a lie

2932 Therefore thus saith the Lord behold I will visit upon Semeias
the Nehelamite and upon his seed he shall not have a man to sit in
the midst of this people and he shall not see the good that I will do
to my people saith the Lord because he hath spoken treason against
the Lord



Jeremias Chapter 30


God will deliver his people from their captivity Christ shall be their
king and his church shall be glorious for ever

301 This is the word that came to Jeremias from the Lord saying

302 Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel saying Write thee all
the words that I have spoken to thee in a book

303 For behold the days come saith the Lord and I will bring again
the captivity of my people Israel and Juda saith the Lord and I will
cause them to return to the land which I gave to their fathers and
they shall possess it

304 And these are the words that the Lord hath spoken to Israel and
to Juda

305 For thus saith the Lord We have heard a voice of terror there
is fear and no peace

306 Ask ye and see if a man bear children why then have I seen
every man with his hands on his loins like a woman in labour and all
faces are turned yellow

307 Alas for that day is great neither is there the like to it and
it is the time of tribulation to Jacob but he shall be saved out of
it

308 And it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord of hosts
that I will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst his bands
and strangers shall no more rule over him

309 But they shall serve the Lord their God and David their king
whom I will raise up to them

David  That is Christ of the house of David

3010 Therefore fear thou not my servant Jacob saith the Lord
neither be dismayed O Israel for behold I will save thee from a
country afar off and thy seed from the land of their captivity and
Jacob shall return and be at rest and abound with all good things
and there shall be none whom he may fear

3011 For I am with thee saith the Lord to save thee for I will
utterly consume all the nations among which I have scattered thee but
I will not utterly consume thee but I will chastise thee in judgment
that thou mayst not seem to thyself innocent

3012 For thus saith the Lord Thy bruise is incurable thy wound is
very grievous

3013 There is none to judge thy judgment to bind it up thou hast no
healing medicines

3014 All thy lovers have forgotten thee and will not seek after
thee for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with cruel
chastisement by reason of the multitude of thy iniquities thy sins
are hardened

3015 Why criest thou for thy affliction thy sorrow is incurable for
the multitude of thy iniquity and for thy hardened sins I have done
these things to thee

3016 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all
thy enemies shall be carried into captivity and they that waste thee
shall be wasted and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey

3017 For I will close up thy scar and will heal thee of thy wounds
saith the Lord Because they have called thee O Sion an outcast This
is she that hath none to seek after her

3018 Thus saith the Lord Behold I will bring back the captivity of
the pavilions of Jacob and will have pity on his houses and the city
shall be built in her high place and the temple shall be founded
according to the order thereof

3019 And out of them shall come forth praise and the voice of them
that play and I will multiply them and they shall not be made few
and I will glorify them and they shall not be lessened

3020 And their children shall be as from the beginning and their
assembly shall be permanent before me and I will visit against all
that afflict them

3021 And their leader shall be of themselves and their prince shall
come forth from the midst of them and I will bring him near and he
shall come to me for who is this that setteth his heart to approach to
me saith the Lord

3022 And you shall be my people and I will be your God

3023 Behold the whirlwind of the Lord his fury going forth a
violent storm it shall rest upon the head of the wicked

3024 The Lord will not turn away the wrath of his indignation till
he have executed and performed the thought of his heart in the latter
days you shall understand these things



Jeremias Chapter 31


The restoration of Israel Rachel shall cease from morning The new
covenant The church shall never fail

311 At that time saith the Lord I will be the God of all the
families of Israel and they shall be my people

312 Thus saith the Lord The people that were left and escaped from
the sword found grace in the desert Israel shall go to his rest

313 The Lord hath appeared from afar to me Yea I have loved thee
with an everlasting love therefore have I drawn thee taking pity on
thee

314 And I will build thee again and thou shalt be built O virgin of
Israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy timbrels and shalt go
forth in the dances of them that make merry

315 Thou shalt yet plant vineyards in the mountains of Samaria the
planters shall plant and they shall not gather the vintage before the
time

316 For there shall be a day in which the watchmen on mount Ephraim
shall cry Arise and let us go up to Sion to the Lord our God

317 For thus saith the Lord Rejoice ye in the joy of Jacob and
neigh before the head of the Gentiles shout ye and sing and say
Save O Lord thy people the remnant of Israel

318 Behold I will bring them from the north country and will gather
them from the ends of the earth and among them shall be the blind and
the lame the woman with child and she that is bringing forth
together a great company of them returning hither

319 They shall come with weeping and I will bring them back in
mercy and I will bring them through the torrents of waters in a right
way and they shall not stumble in it for I am a father to Israel and
Ephraim is my firstborn

3110 Hear the word of the Lord O ye nations and declare it in the
islands that are afar off and say He that scattered Israel will
gather him and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his flock

3111 For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob and delivered him out of the
hand of one that was mightier than he

3112 And they shall come and shall give praise in mount Sion and
they shall flow together to the good things of the Lord for the corn
and wine and oil and the increase of cattle and herds and their soul
shall be as a watered garden and they shall be hungry no more

3113 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance the young men and
old men together and I will turn their mourning into joy and will
comfort them and make them joyful after their sorrow

3114 And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness and my
people shall be filled with my good things saith the Lord

3115 Thus saith the Lord A voice was heard on high of lamentation
of mourning and weeping of Rachel weeping for her children and
refusing to be comforted for them because they are not

3116 Thus saith the Lord Let thy voice cease from weeping and thy
eyes tears for there is a reward for thy work saith the Lord and
they shall return out of the land of the enemy

3117 And there is hope for thy last end saith the Lord and the
children shall return to their own borders

3118 Hearing I heard Ephraim when he went into captivity thou hast
chastised me and I was instructed as a young bullock unaccustomed to
the yoke Convert me and I shall be converted for thou art the Lord
my God

3119 For after thou didst convert me I did penance and after thou
didst shew unto me I struck my thigh I am confounded and ashamed
because I have borne the reproach of my youth

3120 Surely Ephraim is an honourable son to me surely he is a tender
child for since I spoke of him I will still remember him Therefore
are my bowels troubled for him pitying I will pity him saith the
Lord

3121 Set thee up a watchtower make to thee bitterness direct thy
heart into the right way wherein thou hast walked return O virgin of
Israel return to these thy cities

3122 How long wilt thou be dissolute in deliciousness O wandering
daughter for the Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth A WOMAN
SHALL COMPASS A MAN

3123 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel As yet shall
they say this word in the land of Juda and in the cities thereof when
I shall bring back their captivity The Lord bless thee the beauty of
justice the holy mountain

3124 And Juda and all his cities shall dwell therein together the
husbandman and they that drive the flocks

3125 For I have inebriated the weary soul and I have filled every
hungry soul

3126 Upon this I was as it were awaked out of a sleep and I saw and
my sleep was sweet to me

3127 Behold the days come saith the Lord and I will sow the house
of Israel and the house of Juda with the seed of men and with the seed
of beasts

3128 And as I have watched over them to pluck up and to throw down
and to scatter and destroy and afflict so will I watch over them to
build up and to plant them saith the Lord

3129 In those days they shall say no more The fathers have eaten a
sour grape and the teeth of the children are set on edge

3130 But every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that
shall eat the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge

3131 Behold the days shall come saith the Lord and I will make a
new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Juda

3132 Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers
in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land
of Egypt the covenant which they made void and I had dominion over
them saith the Lord

3133 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house
of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will give my law in
their bowels and I will write it in their heart and I will be their
God and they shall be my people

3134 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every
man his brother saying Know the Lord for all shall know me from the
least of them even to the greatest saith the Lord for I will forgive
their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more

3135 Thus saith the Lord who giveth the sun for the light of the
day the order of the moon and of the stars for the light of the
night who stirreth up the sea and the waves thereof roar the Lord of
hosts is his name

3136 If these ordinances shall fail before me saith the Lord then
also the seed of Israel shall fail so as not to be a nation before me
for ever

3137 Thus saith the Lord If the heavens above can be measured and
the foundations of the earth searched out beneath I also will cast
away all the seed of Israel for all that they have done saith the
Lord

3138 Behold the days come saith the Lord that the city shall be
built to the Lord from the tower of Hanameel even to the gate of the
corner

3139 And the measuring line shall go out farther in his sight upon
the hill Gareb and it shall compass Goatha

3140 And the whole valley of dead bodies and of ashes and all the
country of death even to the torrent Cedron and to the corner of the
horse gate towards the east the Holy of the Lord it shall not be
plucked up and it shall not be destroyed any more for ever



Jeremias Chapter 32


Jeremias by Gods commandment purchases a field of his kinsman and
prophesies the return of the people out of captivity and the
everlasting covenant God will make with his church

321 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the tenth year of
Sedecias king of Juda the same is the eighteenth year of
Nabuchodonosor

322 At that time the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem
and Jeremias the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which
was in the house of the king of Juda

323 For Sedecias king of Juda had shut him up saying Why dost thou
prophesy saying Thus saith the Lord Behold I will give this city
into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall take it

324 And Sedecias king of Juda shall not escape out of the hand of the
Chaldeans but he shall be delivered into the hands of the king of
Babylon and he shall speak to him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall
see his eyes

325 And he shall lead Sedecias to Babylon and he shall be there till
I visit him saith the Lord But if you will fight against the
Chaldeans you shall have no success

326 And Jeremias said The word of the Lord came to me saying

327 Behold Hanameel the son of Sellum thy cousin shall come to thee
saying Buy thee my field which is in Anathoth for it is thy right to
buy it being next akin

328 And Hanameel my uncles son came to me according to the word of
the Lord to the entry of the prison and said to me Buy my field
which is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin for the right of
inheritance is thine and thou art next of kin to possess it And I
understood that this was the word of the Lord

329 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncles son that is in
Anathoth and I weighed him the money seven staters and ten pieces of
silver

3210 And I wrote it in a book and sealed it and took witnesses and
I weighed him the money in the balances

3211 And I took the deed of the purchase that was sealed and the
stipulations and the ratifications with the seals that were on the
outside

3212 And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neri
the son of Maasias in the sight of Hanameel my uncles son in the
presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase and
before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison

3213 And I charged Baruch before them saying

3214 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Take these
writings this deed of the purchase that is sealed up and this deed
that is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue
many days

3215 For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Houses and
fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land

3216 And after I had delivered the deed of purchase to Baruch the son
of Neri I prayed to the Lord saying

3217 Alas alas alas O Lord God behold thou hast made heaven and
earth by thy great power and thy stretched out arm no word shall be
hard to thee

3218 Thou shewest mercy unto thousands and returnest the iniquity of
the fathers into the bosom of their children after them O most mighty
great and powerful the Lord of hosts is thy name

3219 Great in counsel and incomprehensible in thought whose eyes
are open upon all the ways of the children of Adam to render unto
every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his
devices

3220 Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even until
this day and in Israel and amongst men and hast made thee a name as
at this day

3221 And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of
Egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and a
stretched out arm and with great terror

3222 And hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their
fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey

3223 And they came in and possessed it but they obeyed not thy
voice and they walked not in thy law and they did not any of those
things that thou didst command them to do and all these evils are come
upon them

3224 Behold works are built up against the city to take it and the
city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who fight against it by
the sword and the famine and the pestilence and what thou hast
spoken is all come to pass as thou thyself seest

3225 And sayest thou to me O Lord God Buy a field for money and
take witnesses whereas the city is given into the hands of the
Chaldeans

3226 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias saying

3227 Behold I am the Lord the God of all flesh shall any thing be
hard for me

3228 Therefore thus saith the Lord Behold I will deliver this city
into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hands of the king of
Babylon and they shall take it

3229 And the Chaldeans that fight against this city shall come and
set it on fire and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they
offered sacrifice to Baal and poured out drink offerings to strange
gods to provoke me to wrath

3230 For the children of Israel and the children of Juda have
continually done evil in my eyes from their youth the children of
Israel who even till now provoke me with the work of their hands saith
the Lord

3231 For this city hath been to me a provocation and indignation from
the day that they built it until this day in which it shall be taken
out of my sight

3232 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the
children of Juda which they have done provoking me to wrath they and
their kings their princes and their priests and their prophets the
men of Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem

3233 And they have turned their backs to me and not their faces
when I taught them early in the morning and instructed them and they
would not hearken to receive instruction

3234 And they have set their idols in the house in which my name is
called upon to defile it

3235 And they have built the high places of Baal which are in the
valley of the son of Ennom to consecrate their sons and their
daughters to Moloch which I commanded them not neither entered it
into my heart that they should do this abomination and cause Juda to
sin

3236 And now therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to
this city whereof you say that it shall be delivered into the hands of
the king of Babylon by the sword and by famine and by pestilence

3237 Behold I will gather them together out of all the lands to which
I have cast them out in my anger and in my wrath and in my great
indignation and I will bring them again into this place and will
cause them to dwell securely

3238 And they shall be my people and I will be their God

3239 And I will give them one heart and one way that they may fear
me all days and that it may be well with them and with their children
after them

3240 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them and will not
cease to do them good and I will give my fear in their heart that
they may not revolt from me

3241 And I will rejoice over them when I shall do them good and I
will plant them in this land in truth with my whole heart and with
all my soul

3242 For thus saith the Lord As I have brought upon this people all
this great evil so will I bring upon them all the good that I now
speak to them

3243 And fields shall be purchased in this land whereof you say that
it is desolate because there remaineth neither man nor beast and it
is given into the hands of the Chaldeans

3244 Fields shall be bought for money and deeds shall be written
and sealed and witnesses shall be taken in the land of Benjamin and
round about Jerusalem in the cities of Juda and in the cities on the
mountains and in the cities of the plains and in the cities that are
towards the south for I will bring back their captivity saith the
Lord



Jeremias Chapter 33


God promises reduction from captivity and other blessings especially
the coming of Christ whose reign in his church shall be glorious and
perpetual

331 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the second time while
he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying

332 Thus saith the Lord who will do and will form it and prepare
it the Lord is his name

333 Cry to me and I will hear thee and I will shew thee great
things and sure things which thou knowest not

334 For thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to the houses of this
city and to the houses of the king of Juda which are destroyed and
to the bulwarks and to the sword

335 Of them that come to fight with the Chaldeans and to fill them
with the dead bodies of the men whom I have slain in my wrath and in
my indignation hiding my face from this city because of all their
wickedness

336 Behold I will close their wounds and give them health and I will
cure them and I will reveal to them the prayer of peace and truth

The prayer of peace  That is the peace and welfare which they pray
for

337 And I will bring back the captivity of Juda and the captivity of
Jerusalem and I will build them as from the beginning

338 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they
have sinned against me and I will forgive all their iniquities
whereby they have sinned against me and despised me

339 And it shall be to me a name and a joy and a praise and a
gladness before all the nations of the earth that shall hear of all
the good things which I will do to them and they shall fear and be
troubled for all the good things and for all the peace that I will
make for them

3310 Thus saith the Lord There shall be heard again in this place
which you say is desolate because there is neither man nor beast in
the cities of Juda and without Jerusalem which are desolate without
man and without inhabitant and without beast

3311 The voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the
bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall
say Give ye glory to the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good for his
mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring their vows into
the house of the Lord for I will bring back the captivity of the land
as at the first saith the Lord

3312 Thus saith the Lord of hosts There shall be again in this place
that is desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities
thereof an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down

3313 And in the cities on the mountains and in the cities of the
plains and in the cities that are towards the south and in the land
of Benjamin and round about Jerusalem and in the cities of Juda shall
the flocks pass again under the hand of him that numbereth them saith
the Lord

3314 Behold the days come saith the Lord that I will perform the
good word that I have spoken to the house of Israel and to the house
of Juda

3315 In those days and at that time I will make the bud of justice
to spring forth unto David and he shall do judgment and justice in the
earth

3316 In those days shall Juda be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell
securely and this is the name that they shall call him The Lord our
just one

3317 For thus saith the Lord There shall not be cut off from David a
man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel

There shall not be cut off from David etc  This was verified in
Christ who is of the house of David and whose kingdom in his church
shall have no end

3318 Neither shall there be cut off from the priests and Levites a
man before my face to offer holocausts and to burn sacrifices and to
kill victims continually

Neither shall there be cut off from the priests etc  This promise
relates to the Christian priesthood which shall also continue for
ever the functions of which more especially the great sacrifice of
the altar are here expressed by the name of holocausts and other
offerings of the law which were so many figures of the Christian
sacrifice

3319 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias saying

3320 Thus saith the Lord if my covenant with the day can be made
void and my covenant with the night that there should not be day and
night in their season

3321 Also my covenant with David my servant may be made void that he
should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the Levites
and priests my ministers

3322 As the stars of heaven cannot be numbered nor the sand of the
sea be measured so will I multiply the seed of David my servant and
the Levites my ministers

3323 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias saying

3324 Hast thou not seen what this people hath spoken saying The two
families which the Lord had chosen are cast off and they have
despised my people so that it is no more a nation before them

Two families etc  Viz the families of the kings and priests

3325 Thus saith the Lord If I have not set my covenant between day
and night and laws to heaven and earth

3326 Surely I will also cast off the seed of Jacob and of David my
servant so as not to take any of his seed to be rulers of the seed of
Abraham Isaac and Jacob for I will bring back their captivity and
will have mercy on them



Jeremias Chapter 34


The prophet foretells that Sedecias shall fall into the hands of
Nabuchodonosor Gods sentence upon the princes and people that had
broken his covenant

341 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord when Nabuchodonosor
king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth
that were under the power of his hand and all the people fought
against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying

342 Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel Go and speak to Sedecias
king of Juda and say to him Thus saith the Lord Behold I will
deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon and he shall
burn it with fire

343 And thou shalt not escape out of his hand but thou shalt surely
be taken and thou shalt be delivered into his hand and thy eyes shall
see the eyes of the king of Babylon and his mouth shall speak with thy
mouth and thou shalt go to Babylon

344 Yet hear the word of the Lord O Sedecias king of Juda Thus
saith the Lord to thee Thou shalt not die by the sword

345 But thou shalt die in peace and according to the burnings of thy
fathers the former kings that were before thee so shall they burn
thee and they shall mourn for thee saying Alas Lord for I have
spoken the word saith the Lord

Die in peace  That is by a natural death

346 And Jeremias the prophet spoke all these words to Sedecias the
king of Juda in Jerusalem

347 And the army of the king of Babylon fought against Jerusalem and
against all the cities of Juda that were left against Lachis and
against Azecha for these remained of the cities of Juda fenced
cities

348 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord after that king
Sedecias had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem making a
proclamation

349 That every man should let his manservant and every man his
maidservant being Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman go free and that they
should not lord it over them to wit over the Jews their brethren

3410 And all the princes and all the people who entered into the
covenant heard that every man should let his manservant and every man
his maidservant go free and should no more have dominion over them
and they obeyed and let them go free

3411 But afterwards they turned and brought back again their
servants and their handmaids whom they had let go free and brought
them into subjection as menservants and maidservants

3412 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias from the Lord saying

3413 Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel I made a covenant with
your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt
out of the house of bondage saying

3414 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother being
a Hebrew who hath been sold to thee so he shall serve thee six years
and thou shalt let him go free from thee and your fathers did not
hearken to me nor did they incline their ear

3415 And you turned to day and did that which was right in my eyes
in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and you made a
covenant in my sight in the house upon which my name is invocated

3416 And you are fallen back and have defiled my name and you have
brought back again every man his manservant and every man his
maidservant whom you had let go free and set at liberty and you have
brought them into subjection to be your servants and handmaids

3417 Therefore thus saith the Lord You have not hearkened to me in
proclaiming liberty every man to his brother and every man to his
friend behold I proclaim a liberty for you saith the Lord to the
sword to the pestilence and to the famine and I will cause you to be
removed to all the kingdoms of the earth

3418 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant and
have not performed the words of the covenant which they agreed to in my
presence when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts
thereof

3419 The princes of Juda and the princes of Jerusalem the eunuchs
and the priests and all the people of the land that passed between the
parts of the calf

3420 And I will give them into the hands of their enemies and into
the hands of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be
for meat to the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the earth

3421 And Sedecias the king of Juda and his princes I will give into
the hands of their enemies and into the hands of them that seek their
lives and into the hands of the armies of the king of Babylon which
are gone from you

3422 Behold I will command saith the Lord and I will bring them
again to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and
burn it with fire and I will make the cities of Juda a desolation
without an inhabitant



Jeremias Chapter 35


The obedience of the Rechabites condemns the disobedience of the Jews
The reward of the Rechabites

351 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the days of
Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda saying

352 Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them and bring
them into the house of the Lord into one of the chambers of the
treasures and thou shalt give them wine to drink

Rechabites  These were of the race of Jethro father in law to Moses

353 And I took Jezonias the son of Jeremias the son of Habsanias and
his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites

354 And I brought them into the house of the Lord to the treasure
house of the sons of Hanan the son of Jegedelias the man of God which
was by the treasure house of the princes above the treasure of Maasias
the son of Sellum who was keeper of the entry

355 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots
full of wine and cups and I said to them Drink ye wine

356 And they answered  We will not drink wine because Jonadab the
son of Rechab our father commanded us saying You shall drink no
wine neither you nor your children for ever

357 Neither shall ye build houses nor sow reed nor plant vineyards
nor have any but you shall dwell in tents all your days that you may
live many days upon the face of the earth in which you are strangers

358 Therefore we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab
our father in all things that he commanded us so as to drink no wine
all our days neither we nor our wives nor our sons nor our
daughters

359 Nor to build houses to dwell in nor to have vineyard or field
or seed

3510 But we have dwelt in tents and have been obedient according to
all that Jonadab our father commanded us

3511 But when Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up to our land we
said Come let us go into Jerusalem from the face of the army of the
Chaldeans and from the face of the army of Syria and we have remained
in Jerusalem

3512 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias saying

3513 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Go and say to
the men of Juda and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem Will you not
receive instruction to obey my words saith the Lord

3514 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab by which he commanded
his sons not to drink wine have prevailed and they have drunk none to
this day because they have obeyed the commandment of their father but
I have spoken to you rising early and speaking and you have not
obeyed me

3515 And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets rising
early and sending and saying Return ye every man from his wicked way
and make your ways good and follow not strange gods nor worship them
and you shall dwell in the land which I gave you and your fathers and
you have not inclined your ear nor hearkened to me

3516 So the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have constantly kept
the commandment of their father which he commanded them but this
people hath not obeyed me

3517 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Behold
I will bring upon Juda and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all
the evil that I have pronounced against them because I have spoken to
them and they have not heard I have called to them and they have not
answered me

3518 And Jeremias said to the house of the Rechabites Thus saith the
Lord of hosts the God of Israel Because you have obeyed the
commandment of Jonadab your father and have kept all his precepts and
have done all that he commanded you

3519 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel There
shall not be wanting a man of the race of Jonadab the son of Rechab
standing before me for ever



Jeremias Chapter 36


Jeremias sends Baruch to read his prophecies in the temple the book is
brought to king Joakim who burns it The prophet denounces his
judgment and causes Baruch to write a new copy

361 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Joakim the son of
Josias king of Juda that this word came to Jeremias by the Lord
saying

362 Take thee a roll of a book and thou shalt write in it all the
words that I have spoken to thee against Israel and Juda and against
all the nations from the day that I spoke to thee from the days of
Josias even to this day

363 If so be when the house of Juda shall hear all the evils that I
purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his wicked
way and I will forgive their iniquity and their sin

364 So Jeremias called Baruch the son of Nerias and Baruch wrote
from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the Lord which he spoke to
him upon the roll of a book

365 And Jeremias commanded Baruch saying I am shut up and cannot
go into the house of the Lord

Shut up  Not that the prophet was now in prison for the contrary
appears from ver 19 but that he kept himself shut up by reason of
the persecutions he had lately met with See chap 26

366 Go thou in therefore and read out of the volume which thou hast
written from my mouth the words of the Lord in the hearing of all the
people in the house of the Lord on the fasting day and also thou shalt
read them in the hearing of all Juda that come out of their cities

367 If so be they may present their supplication before the Lord and
may return every one from his wicked way for great is the wrath and
indignation which the Lord hath pronounced against this people

368 And Baruch the son of Nerias did according to all that Jeremias
the prophet had commanded him reading out of the volume the words of
the Lord in the house of the Lord

369 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Joakim the son of Josias
king of Juda in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fast before
the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem and to all the people that
were come together out of the cities of Juda to Jerusalem

3610 And Baruch read out of the volume the words of Jeremias in the
house of the Lord in the treasury of Gamarias the son of Saphan the
scribe in the upper court in the entry of the new gate of the house
of the Lord in the hearing of all the people

3611 And when Micheas the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan had heard
out of the book all the words of the Lord

3612 He went down into the kings house to the secretarys chamber
and behold all the princes sat there Elisama the scribe and Dalaias
the son of Semeias and Elnathan the son of Achobor and Gamarias the
son of Saphan and Sedecias the son of Hananias and all the princes

3613 And Micheas told them all the words that he had heard when
Baruch read out of the volume in the hearing of the people

3614 Therefore all the princes sent Judi the son of Nathanias the
son of Selemias the son of Chusi to Baruch saying Take in thy hand
the volume in which thou hast read in the hearing of the people and
come So Baruch the son of Nerias took the volume in his hand and came
to them

3615 And they said to him Sit down and read these things in our
hearing And Baruch read in their hearing

3616 And when they had heard all the words they looked upon one
another with astonishment and they said to Baruch We must tell the
king all these words

3617 And they asked him saying Tell us how didst thou write all
these words from his mouth

3618 And Baruch said to them With his mouth he pronounced all these
words as if he were reading to me and I wrote in a volume with ink

3619 And the princes said to Baruch Go and hide thee both thou and
Jeremias and let no man know where you are

3620 And they went in to the king into the court but they laid up
the volume in the chamber of Elisama the scribe and they told all the
words in the hearing of the king

3621 And the king sent Judi that he should take the volume who
bringing it out of the chamber of Elisama the scribe read it in the
hearing of the king and of all the princes that stood about the king

3622 Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month and
there was a hearth before him full of burning coals

3623 And when Judi had read three or four pages he cut it with the
penknife and he cast it into the fire that was upon the hearth till
all the volume was consumed with the fire that was on the hearth

3624 And the king and all his servants that heard all these words
were not afraid nor did they rend their garments

3625 But yet Elnathan and Dalaias and Gamarias spoke to the king
not to burn the book and he heard them not

3626 And the king commanded Jeremiel the son of Amelech and Saraias
the son of Ezriel and Selemias the son of Abdeel to take up Baruch
the scribe and Jeremias the prophet but the Lord hid them

3627 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet after
that the king had burnt the volume and the words that Baruch had
written from the mouth of Jeremias saying

3628 Take thee again another volume and write in it all the former
words that were in the first volume which Joakim the king of Juda both
burnt

3629 And thou shalt say to Joakim the king of Juda Thus saith the
Lord Thou hast burnt that volume saying Why hast thou written
therein and said The king of Babylon shall come speedily and shall
lay waste this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and
beast

3630 Therefore thus saith the Lord against Joakim the king of Juda
He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David and his dead body
shall be cast out to the heat by day and to the frost by night

He shall have none etc  Because his son Joachin or Jechonias within
three months after the death of his father was carried away to
Babylon so that his reign is not worthy of notice

3631 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
iniquities and I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of
Jerusalem and upon the men of Juda all the evil that I have pronounced
against them but they have not heard

3632 And Jeremias took another volume and gave it to Baruch the son
of Nerias the scribe who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremias all
the words of the book which Joakim the king of Juda had burnt with
fire and there were added besides many more words than had been
before



Jeremias Chapter 37


Jeremias prophesies that the Chaldeans who had departed from
Jerusalem would return and burn the city He is cast into prison His
conference with Sedecias

371 Now king Sedecias the son of Josias reigned instead of Jechonias
the son of Joakim whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon made king in the
land of Juda

372 But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did
obey the words of the Lord that he spoke in the hand of Jeremias the
prophet

373 And king Sedecias sent Juchal the son of Selemias and Sophonias
the son of Maasias the priest to Jeremias the prophet saying Pray to
the Lord our God for us

374 Now Jeremias walked freely in the midst of the people for they
had not as yet cast him into prison And the army of Pharao was come
out of Egypt and the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem hearing these
tidings departed from Jerusalem

375 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet saying

376 Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel Thus shall you say to the
king of Juda who sent you to inquire of me Behold the army of Pharao
which is come forth to help you shall return into their own land into
Egypt

377 And the Chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city
and take it and burn it with fire

378 Thus saith the Lord Deceive not your souls saying The
Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us for they shall not
go away

379 But if you should even beat all the army of the Chaldeans that
fight against you and there should be left of them some wounded men
they shall rise up every man from his heart and burn this city with
fire

3710 Now when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from Jerusalem
because of Pharaos army

3711 Jeremias went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of
Benjamin and to divide a possession there in the presence of the
citizens

3712 And when he was come to the gate of Benjamin the captain of the
gate who was there in his turn was one named Jerias the son of
Selemias the son of Hananias and he took hold of Jeremias the
prophet saying Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans

3713 And Jeremias answered It is not so I am not fleeing to the
Chaldeans But he hearkened not to him so Jerias took Jeremias and
brought him to the princes

3714 Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremias and they beat
him and cast him into the prison that was in the house of Jonathan the
scribe for he was chief over the prison

3715 So Jeremias went into the house of the prison and into the
dungeon and Jeremias remained there many days

3716 Then Sedecias the king sending took him and asked him
secretly in his house and said Is there thinkest thou any word from
the Lord And Jeremias said There is And he said Thou shalt be
delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon

3717 And Jeremias said to king Sedecias In what have I offended
against thee or thy servants or thy people that thou hast cast me
into prison

3718 Where are your prophets that prophesied to you and said The
king of Babylon shall not come against you and against this land

3719 Now therefore hear I beseech thee my lord the king let my
petition be accepted in thy sight and send me not back into the house
of Jonathan the scribe lest I die there

3720 Then king Sedecias commanded that Jeremias should be committed
into the entry of the prison and that they should give him daily a
piece of bread beside broth till all the bread in the city were
spent and Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison



Jeremias Chapter 38


The prophet at the instance of the great men is cast into a filthy
dungeon he is drawn out by Abdemelech and has another conference with
the king

381 Now Saphatias the son of Mathan and Gedelias the son of Phassur
and Juchal the son of Selemias and Phassur the son of Melchias heard
the words that Jeremias spoke to all the people saying

382 Thus saith the Lord Whosoever shall remain in this city shall
die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence but he that shall
go forth to the Chaldeans shall live and his life shall be safe and
he shall live

383 Thus saith the Lord This city shall surely be delivered into the
hand of the army of the king of Babylon and he shall take it

384 And the princes said to the king We beseech thee that this man
may be put to death for on purpose he weakeneth the hands of the men
of war that remain in this city and the hands of the people speaking
to them according to these words for this man seeketh not peace to
this people but evil

385 And king Sedecias said Behold he is in your hands for it is not
lawful for the king to deny you any thing

386 Then they took Jeremias and cast him into the dungeon of Melchias
the son of Amelech which was in the entry of the prison and they let
down Jeremias by ropes into the dungeon wherein there was no water
but mire And Jeremias sunk into the mire

387 Now Abdemelech the Ethiopian an eunuch that was in the kings
house heard that they had put Jeremias in the dungeon but the king
was sitting in the gate of Benjamin

388 And Abdemelech went out of the kings house and spoke to the
king saying

389 My lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have
done against Jeremias the prophet casting him into the dungeon to die
there with hunger for there is no more bread in the city

3810 Then the king commanded Abdemelech the Ethiopian saying Take
from hence thirty men with thee and draw up Jeremias the prophet out
of the dungeon before he die

3811 So Abdemelech taking the men with him went into the kings
house that was under the storehouse and he took from thence old rags
and old rotten things and he let them down by cords to Jeremias into
the dungeon

3812 And Abdemelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremias Put these old
rags and these rent and rotten things under thy arms and upon the
cords and Jeremias did so

3813 And they drew up Jeremias with the cords and brought him forth
out of the dungeon And Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison

3814 And king Sedecias sent and took Jeremias the prophet to him to
the third gate that was in the house of the Lord and the king said to
Jeremias I will ask thee a thing hide nothing from me

3815 Then Jeremias said to Sedecias If I shall declare it to thee
wilt thou not put me to death and if I give thee counsel thou wilt
not hearken to me

3816 Then king Sedecias swore to Jeremias in private saying As the
Lord liveth that made us this soul I will not put thee to death nor
will I deliver thee into the hands of these men that seek thy life

3817 And Jeremias said to Sedecias Thus saith the Lord of hosts the
God of Israel If thou wilt take a resolution and go out to the princes
of the king of Babylon thy soul shall live and this city shall not be
burnt with fire and thou shalt be safe and thy house

3818 But if thou wilt not go out to the princes of the king of
Babylon this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans
and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of
their hand

3819 And king Sedecias said to Jeremias I am afraid because of the
Jews that are fled over to the Chaldeans lest I should be delivered
into their hands and they should abuse me

3820 But Jeremias answered They shall not deliver thee hearken I
beseech thee to the word of the Lord which I speak to the and it
shall be well with thee and thy soul shall live

3821 But if thou wilt not go forth this is the word which the Lord
hath shewn me

3822 Behold all the women that are left in the house of the king of
Juda shall be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon and
they shall say Thy men of peace have deceived thee and have prevailed
against thee they have plunged thy feet in the mire and in a slippery
place and they have departed from thee

Thy men of peace  Viri pacifici tui That is thy false friends
promising thee peace and happiness and by their evil counsels
involving thee in misery

3823 And all thy wives and thy children shall be brought out to the
Chaldeans and thou shalt not escape their hands but thou shalt be
taken by the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall burn this city
with fire

3824 Then Sedecias said to Jeremias Let no man know these words and
thou shalt not die

3825 But if the princes shall hear that I have spoken with thee and
shall come to thee and say to thee Tell us what thou hast said to the
king hide it not from us and we will not kill thee and also what the
king said to thee

3826 Thou shalt say to them I presented my supplication before the
king that he would not command me to be carried back into the house of
Jonathan to die there

3827 So all the princes came to Jeremias and asked him and he spoke
to them according to all the words that the king had commanded him and
they left him for nothing had been heard

3828 But Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison until the day
that Jerusalem was taken and it came to pass that Jerusalem was taken



Jeremias Chapter 39


After two years siege Jerusalem is taken Sedecias is carried before
Nabuchodonosor who kills his sons in his sight and then puts out his
eyes Jeremias is set at liberty

391 In the ninth year of Sedecias king of Juda in the tenth month
came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon and all his army to Jerusalem and
they besieged it

392 And in the eleventh year of Sedecias in the fourth month the
fifth day of the month the city was opened

393 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in
the middle gate Neregel Sereser Semegarnabu Sarsachim Rabsares
Neregel Serezer Rebmag and all the rest of the princes of the king
of Babylon

394 And when Sedecias the king of Juda and all the men of war saw
them they fled and they went forth in the night out of the city by
the way of the kings garden and by the gate that was between the two
walls and they went out to the way of the desert

395 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them and they took
Sedecias in the plain of the desert of Jericho and when they had taken
him they brought him to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Reblatha
which is in the land of Emath and he gave judgment upon him

396 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias in Reblatha
before his eyes and the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Juda

397 He also put out the eyes of Sedecias and bound him with fetters
to be carried to Babylon

398 And the Chaldeans burnt the kings house and the houses of the
people with fire and they threw down the wall of Jerusalem

399 And Nabuzardan the general of the army carried away captive to
Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and the
fugitives that had gone over to him and the rest of the people that
remained

3910 But Nabuzardan the general left some of the poor people that had
nothing at all in the land of Juda and he gave them vineyards and
cisterns at that time

3911 Now Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had given charge to
Nabuzardan the general concerning Jeremias saying

3912 Take him and set thy eyes upon him and do him no harm but as
he hath a mind so do with him

3913 Therefore Nabuzardan the general sent and Nabuzardan and
Rabsares and Neregel and Sereser and Rebmag and all the nobles of
the king of Babylon

3914 Sent and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison and
committed him to Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan that he
might go home and dwell among the people

3915 But the word of the Lord came to Jeremias when he was yet shut
up in the court of the prison saying Go and tell Abdemelech the
Ethiopian saying

3916 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will
bring my words upon this city unto evil and not unto good and they
shall be accomplished in thy sight in that day

3917 And I will deliver thee in that day saith the Lord and thou
shalt not be given into the hands of the men whom thou fearest

3918 But delivering I will deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by
the sword but thy life shall be saved for thee because thou hast put
thy trust in me saith the Lord



Jeremias Chapter 40


Jeremias remains with Godolias the governor who receives all the Jews
that resort to him

401 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord after that
Nabuzardan the general had let him go from Rama when he had taken him
being bound with chains among all them that were carried away from
Jerusalem and Juda and were carried to Babylon

402 And the general of the army taking Jeremias said to him The
Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place

403 And he hath brought it and the Lord hath done as he hath said
because you have sinned against the Lord and have not hearkened to his
voice and this word is come upon you

404 Now then behold I have loosed thee this day from the chains which
were upon thy hands if it please thee to come with me to Babylon
come and I will set my eyes upon thee but if it do not please thee to
come with me to Babylon stay here behold all the land is before thee
as thou shalt choose and whither it shall please thee to go thither
go

405 And come not with me but dwell with Godolias the son of Ahicam
the son of Saphan whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the
cities of Juda dwell therefore with him in the midst of the people or
whithersoever it shall please thee to go go And the general of the
army gave him victuals and presents and let him go

406 And Jeremias went to Godolias the son of Ahicam to Masphath and
dwelt with him in the midst of the people that were left in the land

407 And when all the captains of the army that were scattered through
the countries they and their companions had heard that the king of
Babylon had made Godolias the son of Ahicam governor of the country
and that he had committed unto him men and women and children and of
the poor of the land them that had not been carried away captive to
Babylon

408 They came to Godolias to Masphath and Ismahel the son of
Nathanias and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Caree and Sareas the
son of Thanehumeth and the children of Ophi that were of Netophathi
and Jezonias the son of Maachati they and their men

409 And Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan swore to them
and to their companions saying Fear not to serve the Chaldeans dwell
in the land and serve the king of Babylon and it shall be well with
you

4010 Behold I dwell in Masphath that I may answer the commandment of
the Chaldeans that are sent to us but as for you gather ye the
vintage and the harvest and the oil and lay it up in your vessels
and abide in your cities which you hold

4011 Moreover all the Jews that were in Moab and among the children
of Ammon and in Edom and in all the countries when they heard that
the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judea and that he had made
Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan ruler over them

4012 All the Jews I say returned out of all the places to which
they had fled and they came into the land of Juda to Godolias to
Masphath and they gathered wine and a very great harvest

4013 Then Johanan the son of Caree and all the captains of the army
that had been scattered about in the countries came to Godolias to
Masphath

4014 And they said to him Know that Baalis the king of the children
of Ammon hath sent Ismahel the son of Nathanias to kill thee And
Godolias the son of Ahicam believed them not

4015 But Johanan the son of Caree spoke to Godolias privately in
Masphath saying I will go and I will kill Ismahel the son of
Nathanias and no man shall know it lest he kill thee and all the
Jews be scattered that are gathered unto thee and the remnant of Juda
perish

4016 And Godolias the son of Ahicam said to Johanan the son of Caree
Do not this thing for what thou sayst of Ismahel is false



Jeremias Chapter 41


Godolias is slain the Jews that were with him are apprehensive of the
Chaldeans

411 And it came to pass in the seventh month that Ismahel the son of
Nathanias the son of Elisama of the royal blood and the nobles of the
king and ten men with him came to Godolias the son of Ahicam into
Masphath and they ate bread there together in Masphath

412 And Ismahel the son of Nathanias arose and the ten men that were
with him and they struck Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan
with the sword and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor
over the land

413 Ismahel slew also all the Jews that were with Godolias in
Masphath and the Chaldeans that were found there and the soldiers

414 And on the second day after he had killed Godolias no man yet
knowing it

415 There came some from Sichem and from Silo and from Samaria
fourscore men with their beards shaven and their clothes rent and
mourning and they had offerings and incense in their hand to offer in
the house of the Lord

416 And Ismahel the son of Nathanias went forth from Masphath to meet
them weeping all along as he went and when he had met them he said
to them Come to Godolias the son of Ahicam

417 And when they were come to the midst of the city Ismahel the son
of Nathanias slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he
and the men that were with him

418 But ten men were found among them that said to Ismahel Kill us
not for we have stores in the field of wheat and barley and oil
and honey And he forbore and slew them not with their brethren

419 And the pit into which Ismahel cast all the dead bodies of the
men whom he slew because of Godolias is the same that king Asa made
for fear of Baasa the king of Israel the same did Ismahel the son of
Nathanias fill with them that were slain

4110 Then Ismahel carried away captive all the remnant of the people
that were in Masphath the kings daughters and all the people that
remained in Masphath whom Nabuzardan the general of the army had
committed to Godolias the son of Ahicam And Ismahel the son of
Nathanias took them and he departed to go over to the children of
Ammon

4111 But Johanan the son of Caree and all the captains of the
fighting men that were with him heard of the evil that Ismahel the son
of Nathanias had done

4112 And taking all the men they went out to fight against Ismahel
the son of Nathanias and they found him by the great waters that are
in Gabaon

4113 And when all the people that were with Ismahel had seen Johanan
the son of Caree and all the captains of the fighting men that were
with him they rejoiced

4114 And all the people whom Ismahel had taken went back to
Masphath and they returned and went to Johanan the son of Caree

4115 But Ismahel the son of Nathanias fled with eight men from the
face of Johanan and went to the children of Ammon

4116 Then Johanan the son of Caree and all the captains of the
soldiers that were with him took all the remnant of the people whom
they had recovered from Ismahel the son of Nathanias from Masphath
after that he had slain Godolias the son of Ahicam valiant men for
war and the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had
brought back from Gabaon

4117 And they departed and sat as sojourners in Chamaam which is
near Bethlehem in order to go forward and enter into Egypt

4118 From the face of the Chaldeans for they were afraid of them
because Ismahel the son of Nathanias had slain Godolias the son of
Ahicam whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the land of Juda



Jeremias Chapter 42


Jeremias assures the remnant of the people that if they will stay in
Juda they shall be safe but if they go down into Egypt they shall
perish

421 Then all the captains of the warriors and Johanan the son of
Caree and Jezonias the son of Osaias and the rest of the people from
the least to the greatest came near

422 And they said to Jeremias the prophet Let our supplication fall
before thee and pray thou for us to the Lord thy God for all this
remnant for we are left but a few of many as thy eyes do behold us

423 And let the Lord thy God shew us the way by which we may walk
and the thing that we must do

424 And Jeremias the prophet said to them I have heard you behold I
will pray to the Lord your God according to your words and whatsoever
thing he shall answer me I will declare it to you and I will hide
nothing from you

425 And they said to Jeremias The Lord be witness between us of
truth and faithfulness if we do not according to every thing for which
the Lord thy God shall send thee to us

426 Whether it be good or evil we will obey the voice of the Lord
our God to whom we send thee that it may be well with us when we
shall hearken to the voice of the Lord our God

Good or evil  That is agreeable or disagreeable

427 Now after ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremias

428 And he called Johanan the son of Caree and all the captains of
the fighting men that were with him and all the people from the least
to the greatest

429 And he said to them Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to
whom you sent me to present your supplications before him

4210 If you will be quiet and remain in this land I will build you
up and not pull you down I will plant you and not pluck you up for
now I am appeased for the evil that I have done to you

I am appeased for the evil that I have done to you  That is I am
appeased as I have sufficiently punished you and now I am reconciled
with you

4211 Fear not because of the king of Babylon of whom you are greatly
afraid fear him not saith the Lord for I am with you to save you
and to deliver you from his hand

4212 And I will shew mercies to you and will take pity on you and
will cause you to dwell in your own land

4213 But if you say We will not dwell in this land neither will we
hearken to the voice of the Lord our God

4214 Saying No but we will go into the land of Egypt where we
shall see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor suffer hunger
and there we will dwell

4215 For this now hear the word of the Lord ye remnant of Juda Thus
saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel If you set your faces to go
into Egypt and enter in to dwell there

4216 The sword which you fear shall overtake you there in the land
of Egypt and the famine whereof you are afraid shall cleave to you
in Egypt and there you shall die

4217 And all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to dwell
there shall die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence none
of them shall remain nor escape from the face of the evil that I will
bring upon them

4218 For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel As my anger
and my indignation hath been kindled against the inhabitants of
Jerusalem so shall my indignation be kindled against you when you
shall enter into Egypt and you shall be an execration and an
astonishment and a curse and a reproach and you shall see this place
no more

4219 This is the word of the Lord concerning you O ye remnant of
Juda Go ye not into Egypt know certainly that I have adjured you this
day

4220 For you have deceived your own souls for you sent me to the
Lord our God saying Pray for us to the Lord our God and according to
all that the Lord our God shall say to thee so declare unto us and we
will do it

4221 And now I have declared it to you this day and you have not
obeyed the voice of the Lord your God with regard to all the things
for which he hath sent me to you

4222 Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword
and by famine and by pestilence in the place to which you desire to go
to dwell there



Jeremias Chapter 43


The Jews contrary to the orders of God by the prophet go into Egypt
carrying Jeremias with them He foretells the devastation of that land
by the king of Babylon

431 And it came to pass that when Jeremias had made an end of
speaking to the people all the words of the Lord their God for which
the Lord their God had sent him to them all these words

432 Azarias the son of Osaias and Johanan the son of Caree and all
the proud men made answer saying to Jeremias Thou tellest a lie the
Lord our God hath not sent thee saying Go not into Egypt to dwell
there

433 But Baruch the son of Nerias setteth thee on against us to
deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans to kill us and to cause us
to be carried away captives to Babylon

434 So Johanan the son of Caree and all the captains of the
soldiers and all the people obeyed not the voice of the Lord to
remain in the land of Juda

435 But Johanan the son of Caree and all the captains of the
soldiers took all the remnant of Juda that were returned out of all
nations to which they had before been scattered to dwell in the land
of Juda

436 Men and women and children and the kings daughters and every
soul which Nabuzardan the general had left with Godolias the son of
Ahicam the son of Saphan and Jeremias the prophet and Baruch the son
of Nerias

437 And they went into the land of Egypt for they obeyed not the
voice of the Lord and they came as far as Taphnis

438 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in Taphnis saying

439 Take great stones in thy hand and thou shalt hide them in the
vault that is under the brick wall at the gate of Pharaos house in
Taphnis in the sight of the men of Juda

4310 And thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God
of Israel Behold I will send and take Nabuchodonosor the king of
Babylon my servant and I will set his throne over these stones which I
have hid and he shall set his throne over them

4311 And he shall come and strike the land of Egypt such as are for
death to death and such as are for captivity to captivity and such
as are for the sword to the sword

4312 And he shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt
and he shall burn them and he shall carry them away captives and he
shall array himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd putteth on
his garment and he shall go forth from thence in peace

4313 And he shall break the statues of the house of the sun that are
in the land of Egypt and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall
burn with fire



Jeremias Chapter 44


The prophets admonition to the Jews in Egypt against idolatry is not
regarded he denounces to them their destruction

441 The word that came to Jeremias concerning all the Jews that
dwelt in the land of Egypt dwelling in Magdal and in Taphnis and in
Memphis and in the land of Phatures saying

442 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel You have seen all
this evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities
of Juda and behold they are desolate this day and there is not an
inhabitant in them

443 Because of the wickedness which they have committed to provoke
me to wrath and to go and offer sacrifice and worship other gods
which neither they nor you nor your fathers knew

444 And I sent to you all my servants the prophets rising early and
sending and saying Do not commit this abominable thing which I hate

445 But they heard not nor inclined their ear to turn from their
evil ways and not to sacrifice to strange gods

446 Wherefore my indignation and my fury was poured forth and was
kindled in the cities of Juda and in the streets of Jerusalem and
they are turned to desolation and waste as at this day

447 And now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Why do
you commit this great evil against your own souls that there should
die of you man and woman child and suckling out of the midst of Juda
and no remnant should be left you

448 In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands by
sacrificing to other gods in the land of Egypt into which you are come
to dwell there and that you should perish and be a curse and a
reproach to all the nations of the earth

449 Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers and the evils of
the kings of Juda and the evils of their wives and your evils and
the evils of your wives that they have done in the land of Juda and
in the streets of Jerusalem

4410 They are not cleansed even to this day neither have they
feared nor walked in the law of the Lord nor in my commandments
which I set before you and your fathers

4411 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Behold
I will set my face upon you for evil and I will destroy all Juda

4412 And I will take the remnant of Juda that have set their faces to
go into the land of Egypt and to dwell there and they shall be all
consumed in the land of Egypt they shall fall by the sword and by the
famine and they shall be consumed from the least even to the greatest
by the sword and by the famine shall they die and they shall be for
an execration and for a wonder and for a curse and for a reproach

4413 And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt as I have
visited Jerusalem by the sword and by famine and by pestilence

4414 And there shall be none that shall escape and remain of the
remnant of the Jews that are gone to sojourn in the land of Egypt and
that shall return into the land of Juda to which they have a desire to
return to dwell there there shall none return but they that shall
flee

4415 Then all the men that knew that their wives sacrificed to other
gods and all the women of whom there stood by a great multitude and
all the people of them that dwelt in the land of Egypt in Phatures
answered Jeremias saying

4416 As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the
Lord we will not hearken to thee

4417 But we will certainly do every word that shall proceed out of
our own mouth to sacrifice to the queen of heaven and to pour out
drink offerings to her as we and our fathers have done our kings and
our princes in the cities of Juda and in the streets of Jerusalem and
we were filled with bread and it was well with us and we saw no evil

The queen of heaven  The moon which they worshipped under this name

4418 But since we left off to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven
and to pour out frank offerings to her we have wanted all things and
have been consumed by the sword and by famine

4419 And if we offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven and pour out
drink offerings to her did we make cakes to worship her to pour out
drink offerings to her without our husbands

4420 And Jeremias spoke to all the people to the men and to the
women and to all the people which had given him that answer saying

4421 Was it not the sacrifice that you offered in the cities of Juda
and in the streets of Jerusalem you and your fathers your kings and
your princes and the people of the land which the Lord hath
remembered and hath it not entered into his heart

4422 So that the Lord could no longer bear because of the evil of
your doings and because of the abominations which you have committed
therefore your land is become a desolation and an astonishment and a
curse without an inhabitant as at this day

4423 Because you have sacrificed to idols and have sinned against
the Lord and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord and have not
walked in his law and in his commandments and in his testimonies
therefore are these evils come upon you as at this day

4424 And Jeremias said to all the people and to all the women Hear
ye the word of the Lord all Juda you that dwell in the land of Egypt

4425 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel saying You and
your wives have spoken with your mouth and fulfilled with your hands
saying Let us perform our vows which we have made to offer sacrifice
to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her you
have fulfilled your vows and have performed them indeed

4426 Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord all Juda you that dwell
in the land of Egypt Behold I have sworn by my great name saith the
Lord that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of
Juda in the land of Egypt saying The Lord God liveth

4427 Behold I will watch over them for evil and not for good and
all the men of Juda that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed
by the sword and by famine till there be an end of them

4428 And a few men that shall flee from the sword shall return out
of the land of Egypt into the land of Juda and all the remnant of Juda
that are gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there shall know whose
word shall stand mine or theirs

4429 And this shall be a sign to you saith the Lord that I will
punish you in this place that you may know that my words shall be
accomplished indeed against you for evil

4430 Thus saith the Lord Behold I will deliver Pharao Nechao king of
Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of them that seek
his life as I delivered Sedecias king of Juda into the land of
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon his enemy and that sought his life



Jeremias Chapter 45


The prophet comforts Baruch in his affliction

451 The word that Jeremias the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of
Nerias when he had written these words in a book out of the mouth of
Jeremias in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda
saying

452 Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to thee Baruch

453 Thou hast said Woe is me wretch that I am for the Lord hath
added sorrow to my sorrow I am wearied with my groans and I find no
rest

454 Thus saith the Lord Thus shalt thou say to him Behold them
whom I have built I do destroy and them whom I have planted I do
pluck up and all this land

455 And dost thou seek great things for thyself Seek not for behold
I will bring evil upon all flesh saith the Lord but I will give thee
thy life and save thee in all places whithersoever thou shalt go



Jeremias Chapter 46


A prophecy against Egypt The Jews shall return from captivity

461 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against
the Gentiles

462 Against Egypt against the army of Pharao Nechao king of Egypt
which was by the river Euphrates in Charcamis whom Nabuchodonosor the
king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Joakim the son of
Josias king of Juda

463 Prepare ye the shield and buckler and go forth to battle

464 Harness the horses and get up ye horsemen stand forth with
helmets furbish the spears put on coats of mail

465 What then I have seen them dismayed and turning their backs
their valiant ones slain they fled apace and they looked not back
terror was round about saith the Lord

466 Let not the swift flee away nor the strong think to escape they
are overthrown and fallen down towards the north by the river
Euphrates

467 Who is this that cometh up as a flood and his streams swell like
those of rivers

468 Egypt riseth up like a flood and the waves thereof shall be
moved as rivers and he shall say I will go up and will cover the
earth I will destroy the city and its inhabitants

469 Get ye up on horses and glory in chariots and let the valiant
men come forth the Ethiopians and the Libyans that hold the shield
and the Lydians that take and shoot arrows

4610 For this is the day of the Lord the God of hosts a day of
vengeance that he may revenge himself of his enemies the sword shall
devour and shall be filled and shall be drunk with their blood for
there is a sacrifice of the Lord God of hosts in the north country by
the river Euphrates

4611 Go up into Galaad and take balm O virgin daughter of Egypt in
vain dost thou multiply medicines there shall be no cure for thee

4612 The nations have heard of thy disgrace and thy howling hath
filled the land for the strong hath stumbled against the strong and
both are fallen together

4613 The word that the Lord spoke to Jeremias the prophet how
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon should come and strike the land of
Egypt

4614 Declare ye to Egypt and publish it in Magdal and let it be
known in Memphis and in Taphnis say ye Stand up and prepare
thyself for the sword shall devour all round about thee

4615 Why are thy valiant men come to nothing they stood not because
the Lord hath overthrown them

4616 He hath multiplied them that fall and one hath fallen upon
another and they shall say Arise and let us return to our own
people and to the land of our nativity from the sword of the dove

The dove  See the annotation on chap 25 ver 38

4617 Call ye the name of Pharao king of Egypt a tumult time hath
brought

4618 As I live saith the King whose name is the Lord of hosts as
Thabor is among the mountains and as Carmel by the sea so shall he
come

4619 Furnish thyself to go into captivity thou daughter inhabitant
of Egypt for Memphis shall be made desolate and shall be forsaken and
uninhabited

4620 Egypt is like a fair and beautiful heifer there shall come from
the north one that shall goad her

4621 Her hirelings also that lived in the midst of her like fatted
calves are turned back and are fled away together and they could not
stand for the day of their slaughter is come upon them the time of
their visitation

4622 Her voice shall sound like brass for they shall hasten with an
army and with axes they shall come against her as hewers of wood

4623 They have cut down her forest saith the Lord which cannot be
counted they are multiplied above locusts and are without number

4624 The daughter of Egypt is confounded and delivered into the hand
of the people of the north

4625 The Lord of hosts the God of Israel hath said Behold I will
visit upon the tumult of Alexandria and upon Pharao and upon Egypt
and upon her gods and upon her kings and upon Pharao and upon them
that trust in him

Visit upon  That is punishIbid Alexandria  In the Hebrew No
which was the ancient name of the city to which Alexander gave
afterwards the name of Alexandria

4626 And I will deliver them into the hand of them that seek their
lives and into the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon and into
the hand of his servants and afterwards it shall be inhabited as in
the days of old saith the Lord

4627 And thou my servant Jacob fear not and be not thou dismayed O
Israel for behold I will save thee from afar off and thy seed out of
the land of thy captivity and Jacob shall return and be at rest and
prosper and there shall be none to terrify him

4628 And thou my servant Jacob fear not saith the Lord because I
am with thee for I will consume all the nations to which I have cast
thee out but thee I will not consume but I will correct thee in
judgment neither will I spare thee as if thou wert innocent



Jeremias Chapter 47


A prophecy of the desolation of the Philistines of Tyre Sidon Gaza
and Ascalon

471 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against
the people of Palestine before Pharao took Gaza

472 Thus saith the Lord Behold there come up waters out of the
north and they shall be as an overflowing torrent and they shall
cover the land and all that is therein the city and the inhabitants
thereof then the men shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land
shall howl

473 At the noise of the marching of arms and of his soldiers at the
rushing of his chariots and the multitude of his wheels The fathers
have not looked back to the children for feebleness of hands

474 Because of the coming of the day in which all the Philistines
shall be laid waste and Tyre and Sidon shall be destroyed with all
the rest of their helpers For the Lord hath wasted the Philistines
the remnant of the isle of Cappadocia

475 Baldness is come upon Gaza Ascalon hath held her peace with the
remnant of their valley how long shalt thou cut thyself

476 O thou sword of the Lord how long wilt thou not be quiet Go
into thy scabbard rest and be still

477 How shall it be quiet when the Lord hath given it a charge
against Ascalon and against the countries thereof by the sea side and
there hath made an appointment for it



Jeremias Chapter 48


A prophecy of the desolation of Moab for their pride but their
captivity shall at last be released

481 Against Moab thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Woe
to Nabo for it is laid waste and confounded Cariathaim is taken the
strong city is confounded and hath trembled

482 There is no more rejoicing in Moab over Hesebon they have
devised evil Come and let us cut it off from being a nation
Therefore shalt thou in silence hold thy peace and the sword shall
follow thee

483 A voice of crying from Oronaim waste and great destruction

484 Moab is destroyed proclaim a cry for her little ones

485 For by the ascent of Luith shall the mourner go up with weeping
for in the descent of Oronaim the enemies have heard a howling of
destruction

486 Flee save your lives and be as heath in the wilderness

487 For because thou hast trusted in thy bulwarks and in thy
treasures thou also shalt be taken and Chamos shall go into
captivity his priests and his princes together

Chamos  The idol of the Moabites

488 And the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall
escape and the valleys shall perish and the plains shall be
destroyed for the Lord hath spoken

489 Give a flower to Moab for in its flower it shall go out and the
cities thereof shall be desolate and uninhabited

4810 Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully and
cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood

Deceitfully  In the Greek negligently The work of God here spoken
of is the punishment of the Moabites

4811 Moab hath been fruitful from his youth and hath rested upon his
lees and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel nor hath gone
into captivity therefore his taste hath remained in him and his scent
is not changed

Moab hath been fruitful  That is rich and flourishing And hath
rested upon his lees  That is remained in its bad morals as wine
not decanted has its lees mixed and remains muddy

4812 Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord and I will send
him men that shall order and overturn his bottles and they shall cast
him down and shall empty his vessels and break their bottles one
against another

4813 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos as the house of Israel was
ashamed of Bethel in which they trusted

Of Bethel  That is of their golden calf which they worshipped in
Bethel

4814 How do you say We are valiant and stout men in battle

4815 Moab is laid waste and they have cast down her cities and her
choice young men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose
name is the Lord of hosts

4816 The destruction of Moab is near to come the calamity thereof
shall come on exceeding swiftly

4817 Comfort him all you that are round about him and all you that
know his name say How is the strong staff broken the beautiful rod

4818 Come down from thy glory and sit in thirst O dwelling of the
daughter of Dibon because the spoiler of Moab is come up to thee he
hath destroyed thy bulwarks

4819 Stand in the way and look out O habitation of Aroer inquire
of him that fleeth and say to him that hath escaped What is done

4820 Moab is confounded because he is overthrown howl ye and cry
tell ye it in Arnon that Moab is wasted

4821 And judgment is come upon the plain country upon Helon and
upon Jasa and upon Mephaath

4822 And upon Dibon and upon Nabo and upon the house of Deblathaim

4823 And upon Cariathaim and upon Bethgamul and upon Bethmaon

4824 And upon Carioth and upon Bosra and upon all the cities of the
land of Moab far or near

4825 The horn of Moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith the
Lord

The horn of Moab is cut off  That is the strength of Moab is cut
off A metaphor drawn from animals whose strength is in their horns

4826 Make him drunk because he lifted up himself against the Lord
and Moab shall dash his hand in his own vomit and he also shall be in
derision

4827 For Israel hath been a derision unto them as though thou hadst
found him amongst thieves for thy words therefore which thou hast
spoken against him thou shalt be led away captive

4828 Leave the cities and dwell in the rock you that dwell in Moab
and be ye like the dove that maketh her nest in the mouth of the hole
in the highest place

4829 We have heard the pride of Moab he is exceeding proud his
haughtiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the loftiness of his
heart

4830 I know saith the Lord his boasting and that the strength
thereof is not according to it neither hath it endeavoured to do
according as it was able

4831 Therefore will I lament for Moab and I will cry out to all
Moab for the men of the brick wall that mourn

4832 O vineyard of Sabama I will weep for thee with the mourning of
Jazer thy branches are gone over the sea they are come even to the
sea of Jazer the robber hath rushed in upon thy harvest and thy
vintage

4833 Joy and gladness is taken away from Carmel and from the land of
Moab and I have taken away the wine out of the presses the treader of
the grapes shall not sing the accustomed cheerful tune

4834 From the cry of Hesebon even to Eleale and to Jasa they have
uttered their voice from Segor to Oronaim as a heifer of three years
old the waters also of Nemrim shall be very bad

4835 And I will take away from Moab saith the Lord him that
offereth in the high places and that sacrificeth to his gods

4836 Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes and my heart
shall sound like pipes for the men of the brick wall because he hath
done more than he could therefore they have perished

4837 For every head shall be bald and every beard shall be shaven
all hands shall be tied together and upon every back there shall be
haircloth

4838 Upon all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof
general mourning because I have broken Moab as an useless vessel
saith the Lord

4839 How is it overthrown and they have howled How hath Moab bowed
down the neck and is confounded And Moab shall be a derision and an
example to all round about him

4840 Thus saith the Lord Behold he shall fly as an eagle and shall
stretch forth his wings to Moab

4841 Carioth is taken and the strongholds are won and the heart of
the valiant men of Moab in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in
labour

4842 And Moab shall cease to be a people because he hath gloried
against the Lord

4843 Fear and the pit and the snare come upon thee O inhabitant of
Moab saith the Lord

Fear  That is the sword of the enemy The pit  That is
unforeseen calamities The snare  That is the ambushes laid by the
enemy

4844 He that shall flee from the fear shall fall into the pit and
he that shall get up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for I
will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation saith the Lord

4845 They that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of Hesebon
but there came a fire out of Hesebon and a flame out of the midst of
Seon and it shall devour part of Moab and the crown of the head of
the children of tumult

4846 Woe to thee Moab thou hast persisted O people of Chamos for
thy sons and thy daughters are taken captives

4847 And I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the last days
saith the Lord Hitherto the judgments of Moab



Jeremias Chapter 49


The like desolation of Ammon of Idumea of the Syrians of the
Agarenes and of the Elamites

491 Against the children of Ammon Thus saith the Lord Hath Israel
no sons or hath he no heir Why then hath Melchom inherited Gad and
his people dwelt in his cities

Melchom  The idol of the Ammonites

492 Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord and I will cause
the noise of war to be heard in Rabbath of the children of Ammon and
it shall be destroyed into a heap and her daughters shall be burnt
with fire and Israel shall possess them that have possessed him saith
the Lord

493 Howl O Hesebon for Hai is wasted Cry ye daughters of Rabbath
gird yourselves with haircloth mourn and go about by the hedges for
Melchom shall be carried into captivity his priests and his princes
together

494 Why gloriest thou in the valleys thy valley hath flowed away O
delicate daughter that hast trusted in thy treasures and hast said
Who shall come to me

495 Behold I will bring a fear upon thee saith the Lord God of
hosts from all that are round about thee and you shall be scattered
every one out of one anothers sight neither shall there be any to
gather together them that flee

496 And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children of Ammon
to return saith the Lord

497 Against Edom Thus saith the Lord of hosts Is wisdom no more in
Theman counsel is perished from her children their wisdom is become
unprofitable

498 Flee and turn your backs go down into the deep hole ye
inhabitants of Dedan for I have brought the destruction of Esau upon
him the time of his visitation

499 If grapegatherers had come to thee would they not have left a
bunch if thieves in the night they would have taken what was enough
for them

4910 But I have made Esau bare I have revealed his secrets and he
cannot be hid his seed is laid waste and his brethren and his
neighbours and he shall not be

4911 Leave thy fatherless children I will make them live and thy
widows shall hope in me

4912 For thus saith the Lord Behold they whose judgment was not to
drink of the cup shall certainly drink and shalt thou come off as
innocent thou shalt not come off as innocent but drinking thou shalt
drink

4913 For I have sworn by myself saith the Lord that Bosra shall
become a desolation and a reproach and a desert and a curse and all
her cities shall be everlasting wastes

4914 I have heard a rumour from the Lord and an ambassador is sent
to the nations Gather yourselves together and come against her and
let us rise up to battle

4915 For behold I have made thee a little one among the nations
despicable among men

4916 Thy arrogancy hath deceived thee and the pride of thy heart O
thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock and endeavourest to lay
hold on the height of the hill but though thou shouldst make thy nest
as high as an eagle I will bring thee down from thence saith the
Lord

4917 And Edom shall be desolate every one that shall pass by it
shall be astonished and shall hiss at all its plagues

4918 As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha and the neighbours
thereof saith the Lord there shall not a man dwell there and there
shall no son of man inhabit it

4919 Behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of the
Jordan against the strong and beautiful for I will make him run
suddenly upon her and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint
over her for who is like to me and who shall abide me and who is
that shepherd that can withstand my countenance

4920 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord which he hath taken
concerning Edom and his thoughts which he hath thought concerning the
inhabitants of Theman surely the little ones of the flock shall cast
them down of a truth they shall destroy them with their habitation

4921 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall the cry of their
voice is heard in the Red Sea

4922 Behold he shall come up as an eagle and fly and he shall
spread his wings over Bosra and in that day the heart of the valiant
ones of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in labour

4923 Against Damascus Emath is confounded and Arphad for they have
heard very bad tidings they are troubled as in the sea through care
they could not rest

4924 Damascus is undone she is put to flight trembling hath seized
on her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in labour

4925 How have they forsaken the city of renown the city of joy

4926 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the
men of war shall be silent in that day saith the Lord of hosts

4927 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus and it shall
devour the strong holds of Benadad

4928 Against Cedar and against the kingdoms of Asor which
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon destroyed Thus saith the Lord Arise
and go ye up to Cedar and waste the children of the east

Cedar and Asor  Were parts of Arabia which with Moab Ammon Edom
etc were all brought under the yoke of Nabuchodonosor

4929 They shall take their tents and their flocks and shall carry
off for themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their
camels and they shall call fear upon them round about

4930 Flee ye get away speedily sit in deep holes you that inhabit
Asor saith the Lord for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath taken
counsel against you and hath conceived designs against you

4931 Arise and go up to a nation that is at ease and that dwelleth
securely saith the Lord they have neither gates nor bars they dwell
alone

4932 And their camels shall be for a spoil and the multitude of their
cattle for a booty and I will scatter into every wind them that have
their hair cut round and I will bring destruction upon them from all
their confines saith the Lord

4933 And Asor shall be a habitation for dragons desolate for ever
no man shall abide there nor son of man inhabit it

4934 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against
Elam in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias king of Juda saying

Elam  A part of Persia

4935 Thus saith the Lord of hosts Behold I will break the bow of
Elam and their chief strength

4936 And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters
of heaven and I will scatter them into all these winds and there
shall be no nation to which the fugitives of Elam shall not come

4937 And I will cause Elam to be afraid before their enemies and in
the sight of them that seek their life and I will bring evil upon
them my fierce wrath saith the Lord and I will send the sword after
them till I consume them

4938 And I will set my throne in Elam and destroy kings and princes
from thence saith the Lord

4939 But in the latter days I will cause the captives of Elam to
return saith the Lord



Jeremias Chapter 50


Babylon which hath afflicted the Israelites after their restoration
shall be utterly destroyed

501 The word that the Lord hath spoken against Babylon and against
the land of the Chaldeans in the hand of Jeremias the prophet

502 Declare ye among the nations and publish it lift up a standard
proclaim and conceal it not say Babylon is taken Bel is confounded
Merodach is overthrown their graven things are confounded their idols
are overthrown

Bel etc  Bel and Merodach were worshipped for gods by the men of
Babylon

503 For a nation is come up against her out of the north which shall
make her land desolate and there shall be none to dwell therein from
man even to beast yea they are removed and gone away

A nation etc  Viz the Medes

504 In those days and at that time saith the Lord the children of
Israel shall come they and the children of Juda together going and
weeping they shall make haste and shall seek the Lord their God

505 They shall ask the way to Sion their faces are hitherward They
shall come and shall be joined to the Lord by an everlasting covenant
which shall never be forgotten

506 My people have been a lost flock their shepherds have caused
them to go astray and have made them wander in the mountains they
have gone from mountain to hill they have forgotten their resting
place

507 All that found them have devoured them and their enemies said
We have not sinned in so doing because they have sinned against the
Lord the beauty of justice and against the Lord the hope of their
fathers

508 Remove out of the midst of Babylon and go forth out of the land
of the Chaldeans and be ye as kids at the head of the flock

509 For behold I raise up and will bring against Babylon an assembly
of great nations from the land of the north and they shall be prepared
against her and from thence she shall be taken their arrows like
those of a mighty man a destroyer shall not return in vain

5010 And Chaldea shall be made a prey all that waste her shall be
filled saith the Lord

5011 Because you rejoice and speak great things pillaging my
inheritance because you are spread abroad as calves upon the grass
and have bellowed as bulls

5012 Your mother is confounded exceedingly and she that bore you is
made even with the dust behold she shall be the last among the
nations a wilderness unpassable and dry

5013 Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited but
shall be wholly desolate every one that shall pass by Babylon shall
be astonished and shall hiss at all her plagues

5014 Prepare yourselves against Babylon round about all you that
bend the bow fight against her spare not arrows because she hath
sinned against the Lord

5015 Shout against her she hath every where given her hand her
foundations are fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the
vengeance of the Lord Take vengeance upon her as she hath done so do
to her

5016 Destroy the sower out of Babylon and him that holdeth the
sickle in the time of harvest for fear of the sword of the dove every
man shall return to his people and every one shall flee to his own
land

The dove  Or the destroyer for the Hebrew word signifies either the
one or the other

5017 Israel is a scattered flock the lions have driven him away
first the king of Assyria devoured him and last this Nabuchodonosor
king of Babylon hath broken his bones

5018 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel Behold
I will visit the king of Babylon and his land as I have visited the
king of Assyria

5019 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation and he shall
feed on Carmel and Bason and his soul shall be satisfied in mount
Ephraim and Galaad

5020 In those days and at that time saith the Lord the iniquity of
Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sin of
Juda and there shall none be found for I will be merciful to them
whom I shall leave

5021 Go up against the land of the rulers and punish the inhabitants
thereof waste and destroy all behind them saith the Lord and do
according to all that I have commanded thee

5022 A noise of war in the land and a great destruction

5023 How is the hammer of the whole earth broken and destroyed how
is Babylon turned into a desert among the nations

5024 I have caused thee to fall into a snare and thou art taken O
Babylon and thou wast not aware of it thou art found and caught
because thou hast provoked the Lord

5025 The Lord hath opened his armoury and hath brought forth the
weapons of his wrath for the Lord the God of hosts hath a work to be
done in the land of the Chaldeans

5026 Come ye against her from the uttermost borders open that they
may go forth that shall tread her down take the stones out of the way
and make heaps and destroy her and let nothing of her be left

5027 Destroy all her valiant men let them go down to the slaughter
woe to them for their day is come the time of their visitation

5028 The voice of them that flee and of them that have escaped out
of the land of Babylon to declare in Sion the revenge of the Lord our
God the revenge of his temple

5029 Declare to many against Babylon to all that bend the bow stand
together against her round about and let none escape pay her
according to her work according to all that she hath done do ye to
her for she hath lifted up herself against the Lord against the Holy
One of Israel

5030 Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets and all her
men of war shall hold their peace in that day saith the Lord

5031 Behold I come against thee O proud one saith the Lord the God
of hosts for thy day is come the time of thy visitation

5032 And the proud one shall fall he shall fall down and there
shall be none to lift him up and I will kindle a fire in his cities
and it shall devour all round about him

5033 Thus saith the Lord of hosts The children of Israel and the
children of Juda are oppressed together all that have taken them
captives hold them fast they will not let them go

5034 Their redeemer is strong the Lord of hosts is his name he will
defend their cause in judgment to terrify the land and to disquiet
the inhabitants of Babylon

5035 A sword is upon the Chaldeans saith the Lord and upon the
inhabitants of Babylon and upon her princes and upon her wise men

5036 A sword upon her diviners and they shall be foolish a sword
upon her valiant ones and they shall be dismayed

5037 A sword upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all
the people that are in the midst of her and they shall become as
women a sword upon her treasures and they shall be made a spoil

5038 A drought upon her waters and they shall be dried up because
it is a land of idols and they glory in monstrous things

5039 Therefore shall dragons dwell there with the fig fauns and
ostriches shall dwell therein and it shall be no more inhabited for
ever neither shall it be built up from generation to generation

Fig fauns  Monsters of the desert or demons in monstrous shapes
such as the ancients called fauns and satyrs and as they imagined them
to live upon wild figs they called them fauni ficarii or fig fauns

5040 As the Lord overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha and their neighbour
cities saith the Lord no man shall dwell there neither shall the son
of man inhabit it

5041 Behold a people cometh from the north and a great nation and
many kings shall rise from the ends of the earth

5042 They shall take the bow and the shield they are cruel and
unmerciful their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall ride
upon horses like a man prepared for battle against thee O daughter of
Babylon

5043 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them and his hands
are grown feeble anguish hath taken hold of him pangs as a woman in
labour

5044 Behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the
Jordan to the strong and beautiful for I will make him run suddenly
upon her and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her
for who is like to me and who shall bear up against me and who is
that shepherd that can withstand my countenance

5045 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord which he hath taken
against Babylon and his thoughts which he hath thought against the
land of the Chaldeans surely the little ones of the flocks shall pull
them down of a truth their habitation shall be destroyed with them

5046 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved and
the cry is heard amongst the nations



Jeremias Chapter 51


The miseries that shall fall upon Babylon from the Medes the
destruction of her idols

511 Thus saith the Lord Behold I will raise up as it were a
pestilential wind against Babylon and against the inhabitants thereof
who have lifted up their heart against me

512 And I will send to Babylon fanners and they shall fan her and
shall destroy her land for they are come upon her on every side in the
day of her affliction

513 Let not him that bendeth bend his bow and let not him go up
that is armed with a coat of mail spare not her young men destroy all
her army

514 And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans and the
wounded in the regions thereof

515 For Israel and Juda have not been forsaken by their God the Lord
of hosts but their land hath been filled with sin against the Holy One
of Israel

516 Flee ye from the midst of Babylon and let every one save his own
life be not silent upon her iniquity for it is the time of revenge
from the Lord he will render unto her what she hath deserved

517 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the hand of the Lord that made
all the earth drunk the nations have drunk of her wine and therefore
they have staggered

518 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed howl for her take
balm for her pain if so she may be healed

519 We would have cured Babylon but she is not healed let us
forsake her and let us go every man to his own land because her
judgment hath reached even to the heavens and is lifted up to the
clouds

5110 The Lord hath brought forth our justices Come and let us
declare in Sion the work of the Lord our God

5111 Sharpen the arrows fill the quivers the Lord hath raised up
the spirit of the kings of the Medes and his mind is against Babylon
to destroy it because it is the vengeance of the Lord the vengeance
of his temple

5112 Upon the walls of Babylon set up the standard strengthen the
watch set up the watchmen prepare the ambushes for the Lord hath
both purposed and done all that he spoke against the inhabitants of
Babylon

5113 O thou that dwellest upon many waters rich in treasures thy
end is come for thy entire destruction

5114 The Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself saying I will fill
thee with men as with locusts and they shall lift up a joyful shout
against thee

5115 He that made the earth by his power that hath prepared the
world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his
understanding

5116 When he uttereth his voice the waters are multiplied in heaven
he lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth he hath turned
lightning into rain and hath brought forth the wind out of his
treasures

5117 Every man is become foolish by his knowledge every founder is
confounded by his idol for what he hath cast is a lie and there is no
breath in them

5118 They are vain works and worthy to be laughed at in the time of
their visitation they shall perish

5119 The portion of Jacob is not like them for he that made all
things he it is and Israel is the sceptre of his inheritance the Lord
of hosts is his name

5120 Thou dashest together for me the weapons of war and with thee I
will dash nations together and with thee I will destroy kingdoms

5121 And with thee I will break in pieces the horse and his rider
and with thee I will break in pieces the chariot and him that getteth
up into it

5122 And with thee I will break in pieces man and woman and with
thee I will break in pieces the old man and the child and with thee I
will break in pieces the young man and the virgin

5123 And with thee I will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock
and with thee I will break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of
oxen and with thee I will break in pieces captains and rulers

5124 And I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of
Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Sion before your eyes
saith the Lord

5125 Behold I come against thee thou destroying mountain saith the
Lord which corruptest the whole earth and I will stretch out my hand
upon thee and will roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a
burnt mountain

5126 And they shall not take of thee a stone for the corner nor a
stone for foundations but thou shalt be destroyed for ever saith the
Lord

5127 Set ye up a standard in the land sound with the trumpet among
the nations prepare the nations against her call together against her
the kings of Ararat Menni and Ascenez number Taphsar against her
bring the horse as the stinging locust

5128 Prepare the nations against her the kings of Media their
captains and all their rulers and all the land of their dominion

5129 And the land shall be in a commotion and shall be troubled for
the design of the Lord against Babylon shall awake to make the land of
Babylon desert and uninhabitable

5130 The valiant men of Babylon have forborne to fight they have
dwelt in holds their strength hath failed and they are become as
women her dwelling places are burnt her bars are broken

5131 One running post shall meet another and messenger shall meet
messenger to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken from one
end to the other

5132 And that the fords are taken and the marshes are burnt with
fire and the men of war are affrighted

5133 For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel The daughter
of Babylon is like a thrashingfloor this is the time of her thrashing
yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come

5134 Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath eaten me up he hath
devoured me he hath made me as an empty vessel he hath swallowed me
up like a dragon he hath filled his belly with my delicate meats and
he hath cast me out

5135 The wrong done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon saith the
habitation of Sion and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea saith
Jerusalem

5136 Therefore thus saith the Lord Behold I will judge thy cause
and will take vengeance for thee and I will make her sea desolate I
and will dry up her spring

5137 And Babylon shall be reduced to heaps a dwelling place for
dragons an astonishment and a hissing because there is no inhabitant

5138 They shall roar together like lions they shall shake their
manes like young lions

5139 In their heat I will set them drink and I will make them drunk
that they may slumber and sleep an everlasting sleep and awake no
more saith the Lord

5140 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter and like
rams with kids

5141 How is Sesach taken and the renowned one of all the earth
surprised How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations

5142 The sea is come up over Babylon  she is covered with the
multitude of the waves thereof

5143 Her cities are become an astonishment a land uninhabited and
desolate a land wherein none can dwell nor son of man pass through
it

5144 And I will visit against Bel in Babylon and I will bring forth
out of his mouth that which he had swallowed down and the nations
shall no more flow together to him for the wall also of Babylon shall
fall

5145 Go out of the midst of her my people that every man may save
his life from the fierce wrath of the Lord

5146 And lest your hearts faint and ye fear for the rumour that
shall be heard in the land and a rumour shall come in one year and
after this year another rumour and iniquity in the land and ruler
upon ruler

5147 Therefore behold the days come and I will visit the idols of
Babylon and her whole land shall be confounded and all her slain
shall fall in the midst of her

5148 And the heavens and the earth and all things that are in them
shall give praise for Babylon for spoilers shall come to her from the
north saith the Lord

5149 And as Babylon caused that there should fall slain in Israel so
of Babylon there shall fall slain in all the earth

5150 You that have escaped the sword come away stand not still
remember the Lord afar off and let Jerusalem come into your mind

5151 We are confounded because we have heard reproach shame hath
covered our faces because strangers are come upon the sanctuaries of
the house of the Lord

5152 Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord and I will visit
her graven things and in all her land the wounded shall groan

5153 If Babylon should mount up to heaven and establish her strength
on high from me there should come spoilers upon her saith the Lord

5154 The noise of a cry from Babylon and great destruction from the
land of the Chaldeans

5155 Because the Lord hath laid Babylon waste and destroyed out of
her the great voice and their wave shall roar like many waters their
voice hath made a noise

5156 Because the spoiler is come upon her that is upon Babylon and
her valiant men are taken and their bow is weakened because the Lord
who is a strong revenger will surely repay

5157 And I will make her princes drunk and her wise men and her
captains and her rulers and her valiant men and they shall sleep an
everlasting sleep and shall awake no more saith the king whose name
is Lord of hosts

5158 Thus saith the Lord of hosts That broad wall of Babylon shall
be utterly broken down and her high gates shall be burnt with fire
and the labours of the people shall come to nothing and of the nations
shall go to the fire and shall perish

5159 The word that Jeremias the prophet commanded Saraias the son of
Nerias the son of Maasias when he went with king Sedecias to Babylon
in the fourth year of his reign now Saraias was chief over the
prophecy

5160 And Jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to come
upon Babylon all these words that are written against Babylon

5161 And Jeremias said to Saraias When thou shalt come into Babylon
and shalt see and shalt read all these words

5162 Thou shalt say O Lord thou hast spoken against this place to
destroy it so that there should be neither man nor beast to dwell
therein and that it should be desolate for ever

5163 And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book thou
shalt tie a stone to it and shalt throw it into the midst of the
Euphrates

5164 And thou shalt say Thus shall Babylon sink and she shall not
rise up from the affliction that I will bring upon her and she shall
be utterly destroyed Thus far are the words of Jeremias



Jeremias Chapter 52


A recapitulation of the reign of Sedecias and the destruction of
Jerusalem The number of the captives

521 Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem and the name of his mother was
Amital the daughter of Jeremias of Lobna

522 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord according
to all that Joakim had done

523 For the wrath of the Lord was against Jerusalem and against
Juda till he cast them out from his presence and Sedecias revolted
from the king of Babylon

524 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth
month the tenth day of the month that Nabuchodonosor the king of
Babylon came he and all his army against Jerusalem and they besieged
it and built forts against it round about

525 And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king
Sedecias

526 And in the fourth month the ninth day of the month a famine
overpowered the city and there was no food for the people of the land

527 And the city was broken up and the men of war fled and went out
of the city in the night by the way of the gate that is between the two
walls and leadeth to the kings garden the Chaldeans besieging the
city round about and they went by the way that leadeth to the
wilderness

528 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king and they
overtook Sedecias in the desert which is near Jericho and all his
companions were scattered from him

529 And when they had taken the king they carried him to the king of
Babylon to Reblatha which is in the land of Emath and he gave
judgment upon him

5210 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias before his
eyes and he slew all the princes of Juda in Reblatha

5211 And he put out the eyes of Sedecias and bound him with fetters
and the king of Babylon brought him into Babylon and he put him in
prison till the day of his death

5212 And in the fifth month the tenth day of the month the same is
the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came Nabuzardan
the general of the army who stood before the king of Babylon in
Jerusalem

5213 And he burnt the house of the Lord and the kings house and
all the houses of Jerusalem and every great house he burnt with fire

5214 And all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the general
broke down all the wall of Jerusalem round about

5215 But Nabuzardan the general carried away captives some of the
poor people and of the rest of the common sort who remained in the
city and of the fugitives that were fled over to the king of Babylon
and the rest of the multitude

5216 But of the poor of the land Nabuzardan the general left some
for vinedressers and for husbandmen

5217 The Chaldeans also broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were
in the house of the Lord and the bases and the sea of brass that was
in the house of the Lord and they carried all the brass of them to
Babylon

5218 And they took the caldrons and the fleshhooks and the
psalteries and the bowls and the little mortars and all the brazen
vessels that had been used in the ministry and

5219 The general took away the pitchers and the censers and the
pots and the basins and the candlesticks and the mortars and the
cups as many as were of gold in gold and as many as were of silver
in silver

5220 And the two pillars and one sea and twelve oxen of brass that
were under the bases which king Solomon had made in the house of the
Lord there was no weight of the brass of all these vessels

5221 And concerning the pillars one pillar was eighteen cubits high
and a cord of twelve cubits compassed it about but the thickness
thereof was four fingers and it was hollow within

5222 And chapiters of brass were upon both and the height of one
chapiter was five cubits and network and pomegranates were upon the
chapiters round about all of brass The same of the second pillar and
the pomegranates

5223 And there were ninetysix pomegranates hanging down and the
pomegranates being a hundred in all were compassed with network

5224 And the general took Saraias the chief priest and Sophonias the
second priest and the three keepers of the entry

5225 He also took out of the city one eunuch that was chief over the
men of war and seven men of them that were near the kings person
that were found in the city and a scribe an officer of the army who
exercised the young soldiers and threescore men of the people of the
land that were found in the midst of the city

5226 And Nabuzardan the general took them and brought them to the
king of Babylon to Reblatha

5227 And the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death in
Reblatha in the land of Emath and Juda was carried away captive out
of his land

5228 This is the people whom Nabuchodonosor carried away captive in
the seventh year three thousand and twentythree Jews

5229 In the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor eight hundred and
thirtytwo souls from Jerusalem

5230 In the three and twentieth year of Nabuchodonosor Nabuzardan
the general carried away of the Jews seven hundred and fortyfive
souls So all the souls were four thousand six hundred

5231 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
captivity of Joachin king of Juda in the twelfth month the five and
twentieth day of the month that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the
first year of his reign lifted up the head of Joachin king of Juda
and brought him forth out of prison

5232 And he spoke kindly to him and he set his throne above the
thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon

5233 And he changed his prison garments and he ate bread before him
always all the days of his life

5234 And for his diet a continual provision was allowed him by the
king of Babylon every day a portion until the day of his death all
the days of his life




THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAS



In these JEREMIAS laments in a most pathetical manner the miseries of
his people and the destruction of JERUSALEM and the temple in Hebrew
verses beginning with different letters according to the order of the
Hebrew alphabet



Lamentations Chapter 1


PREFACE And it came to pass after Israel was carried into captivity
and Jerusalem was desolate that Jeremias the prophet sat weeping and
mourned with this lamentation over Jerusalem and with a sorrowful
mind sighing and moaning he said

And it came to pass etc  This preface was not written by Jeremias
but was added by the seventy interpreters to give the reader to
understand upon what occasion the Lamentations were published

11 Aleph How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people how
is the mistress of the Gentiles become as a widow the princes of
provinces made tributary

12 Beth Weeping she hath wept in the night and her tears are on
her cheeks there is none to comfort her among all them that were dear
to her all her friends have despised her and are become her enemies

13 Ghimel Juda hath removed her dwelling place because of her
affliction and the greatness of her bondage she hath dwelt among the
nations and she hath found no rest all her persecutors have taken her
in the midst of straits

14 Daleth The ways of Sion mourn because there are none that come
to the solemn feast all her gates are broken down her priests sigh
her virgins are in affliction and she is oppressed with bitterness

15 He Her adversaries are become her lords her enemies are
enriched because the Lord hath spoken against her for the multitude of
her iniquities her children are led into captivity before the face of
the oppressor

16 Vau And from the daughter of Sion all her beauty is departed
her princes are become like rams that find no pastures and they are
gone away without strength before the face of the pursuer

17 Zain Jerusalem hath remembered the days of her affliction and
prevarication of all her desirable things which she had from the days
of old when her people fell in the enemys hand and there was no
helper the enemies have seen her and have mocked at her sabbaths

18 Heth Jerusalem hath grievously sinned therefore is she become
unstable all that honoured her have despised her because they have
seen her shame but she sighed and turned backward

19 Teth Her filthiness is on her feet and she hath not remembered
her end she is wonderfully cast down not having a comforter behold
O Lord my affliction because the enemy is lifted up

110 Jod The enemy hath put out his hand to all her desirable things
for she hath seen the Gentiles enter into her sanctuary of whom thou
gavest commandment that they should not enter into thy church

111 Caph All her people sigh they seek bread they have given all
their precious things for food to relieve the soul see O Lord and
consider for I am become vile

112 Lamed O all ye that pass by the way attend and see if there be
any sorrow like to my sorrow for he hath made a vintage of me as the
Lord spoke in the day of his fierce anger

113 Mem From above he hath sent fire into my bones and hath
chastised me he hath spread a net for my feet he hath turned me back
he hath made me desolate wasted with sorrow all the day long

114 Nun The yoke of my iniquities hath watched they are folded
together in his hand and put upon my neck my strength is weakened
the Lord hath delivered me into a hand out of which I am not able to
rise

115 Samech The Lord hath taken away all my mighty men out of the
midst of me he hath called against me the time to destroy my chosen
men the Lord hath trodden the winepress for the virgin daughter of
Juda

116 Ain Therefore do I weep and my eyes run down with water
because the comforter the relief of my soul is far from me my
children are desolate because the enemy hath prevailed

117 Phe Sion hath spread forth her hands there is none to comfort
her the Lord hath commanded against Jacob his enemies are round about
him Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them

118 Sade The Lord is just for I have provoked his mouth to wrath
hear I pray you all ye people and see my sorrow my virgins and my
young men are gone into captivity

119 Coph I called for my friends but they deceived me my priests
and my ancients pined away in the city while they sought their food
to relieve their souls

120 Res Behold O Lord for I am in distress my bowels are
troubled my heart is turned within me for I am full of bitterness
abroad the sword destroyeth and at home there is death alike

121 Sin They have heard that I sigh and there is none to comfort
me all my enemies have heard of my evil they have rejoiced that thou
hast done it thou hast brought a day of consolation and they shall be
like unto me

122 Thau Let all their evil be present before thee and make vintage
of them as thou hast made vintage of me for all my iniquities for my
sighs are many and my heart is sorrowful



Lamentations Chapter 2


21 Aleph How hath the Lord covered with obscurity the daughter of
Sion in his wrath how hath he cast down from heaven to the earth the
glorious one of Israel and hath not remembered his footstool in the
day of his anger

22 Beth The Lord hath cast down headlong and hath not spared all
that was beautiful in Jacob he hath destroyed in his wrath the strong
holds of the virgin of Juda and brought them down to the ground he
hath made the kingdom unclean and the princes thereof

23 Ghimel He hath broken in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel
he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy and he hath
kindled in Jacob as it were a flaming fire devouring round about

24 Daleth He hath bent his bow as an enemy he hath fixed his right
hand as an adversary and he hath killed all that was fair to behold in
the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion he hath poured out his
indignation like fire

25 He The Lord is become as an enemy he hath cast down Israel
headlong he hath overthrown all the walls thereof he hath destroyed
his strong holds and hath multiplied in the daughter of Juda the
afflicted both men and women

26 Vau And he hath destroyed his tent as a garden he hath thrown
down his tabernacle the Lord hath caused feasts and sabbaths to be
forgotten in Sion and hath delivered up king and priest to reproach
and to the indignation of his wrath

27 Zain The Lord hath cast off his altar he hath cursed his
sanctuary he hath delivered the walls of the towers thereof into the
hand of the enemy they have made a noise in the house of the Lord as
in the day of a solemn feast

He hath cursed his sanctuary  That is he permitted his sanctuary to
be destroyed as if it had not been consecrated but execrable

28 Heth The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter
of Sion he hath stretched out his line and hath not withdrawn his
hand from destroying and the bulwark hath mourned and the wall hath
been destroyed together

29 Teth Her gates are sunk into the ground he hath destroyed and
broken her bars her king and her princes are among the Gentiles the
law is no more and her prophets have found no vision from the Lord

210 Jod The ancients of the daughter of Sion sit upon the ground
they have held their peace they have sprinkled their heads with dust
they are girded with haircloth the virgins of Jerusalem hang down
their heads to the ground

211 Caph My eyes have failed with weeping my bowels are troubled
my liver is poured out upon the earth for the destruction of the
daughter of my people when the children and the sucklings fainted
away in the streets of the city

212 Lamed They said to their mothers Where is corn and wine when
they fainted away as the wounded in the streets of the city when they
breathed out their souls in the bosoms of their mothers

213 Mem To what shall I compare thee or to what shall I liken thee
O daughter of Jerusalem to what shall I equal thee that I may comfort
thee O virgin daughter of Sion for great as the sea is thy
destruction who shall heal thee

214 Nun Thy prophets have seen false and foolish things for thee
and they have not laid open thy iniquity to excite thee to penance
but they have seen for thee false revelations and banishments

215 Samech All they that passed by the way have clapped their hands
at thee they have hissed and wagged their heads at the daughter of
Jerusalem saying Is this the city of perfect beauty the joy of all
the earth

216 Phe All thy enemies have opened their month against thee they
have hissed and gnashed with the teeth and have said We will swallow
her up lo this is the day which we looked for we have found it we
have seen it

217 Ain The Lord hath done that which he purposed he hath fulfilled
his word which he commanded in the days of old he hath destroyed and
hath not spared and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee and
hath set up the horn of thy adversaries

218 Sade Their heart cried to the Lord upon the walls of the
daughter of Sion Let tears run down like a torrent day and night give
thyself no rest and let not the apple of thy eye cease

219 Coph Arise give praise in the night in the beginning of the
watches pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord
lift up thy hands to him for the life of thy little children that have
fainted for hunger at the top of all the streets

220 Res Behold O Lord and consider whom thou hast thus dealt with
shall women then eat their own fruit their children of a span long
shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord

221 Sin The child and the old man lie without on the ground my
virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword thou hast slain them
in the day of thy wrath thou hast killed and shewn them no pity

222 Thau Thou hast called as to a festival those that should
terrify me round about and there was none in the day of the wrath of
the Lord that escaped and was left those that I brought up and
nourished my enemy hath consumed them

Gentiles

Christ etc  This according to the letter is spoken of their king
who is called the Christ that is the Anointed of the Lord But it
also relates in the spiritual sense to Christ our Lord suffering for
our sins

421 Sin Rejoice and be glad O daughter of Edom that dwellest in
the land of Hus to thee also shall the cup come thou shalt be made
drunk and naked

422 Thau Thy iniquity is accomplished O daughter of Sion he will
no more carry thee away into captivity he hath visited thy iniquity O
daughter of Edom he hath discovered thy sins

THE PRAYER OF JEREMIAS THE PROPHET



Lamentations Chapter 5


51 Remember O Lord what is come upon us consider and behold our
reproach

52 Our inheritance is turned to aliens our houses to strangers

53 We are become orphans without a father our mothers are as widows

54 We have drunk our water for money we have bought our wood

56 We were dragged by the necks we were weary and no rest was given
us

56 We have given our hand to Egypt and to the Assyrians that we
might be satisfied with bread

57 Our fathers have sinned and are not and we have borne their
iniquities

58 Servants have ruled over us there was none to redeem us out of
their hand

59 We fetched our bread at the peril of our lives because of the
sword in the desert

510 Our skin was burnt as an oven by reason of the violence of the
famine

511 They oppressed the women in Sion and the virgins in the cities
of Juda

512 The princes were hanged up by their hand they did not respect
the persons of the ancients

513 They abused the young men indecently and the children fell under
the wood

514 The ancients have ceased from the gates the young men from the
choir of the singers

515 The joy of our heart is ceased our dancing is turned into
mourning

516 The crown is fallen from our head woe to us because we have
sinned

517 Therefore is our heart sorrowful therefore are our eyes become
dim

518 For mount Sion because it is destroyed foxes have walked upon
it

519 But thou O Lord shalt remain for ever thy throne from
generation to generation

520 Why wilt thou forget us for ever why wilt thou forsake us for a
long time

521 Convert us O Lord to thee and we shall be converted renew our
days as from the beginning

522 But thou hast utterly rejected us thou art exceedingly angry
with us




THE PROPHECY OF BARUCH



BARUCH was a man of noble extraction and learned in the law secretary
and disciple to the prophet JEREMIAS and a sharer in his labours and
persecutions which is the reason why the ancient fathers have
considered this book as a part of the prophecy of JEREMIAS and have
usually quoted it under his name



Baruch Chapter 1


The Jews of Babylon send the book of Baruch with money to Jerusalem
requesting their brethren there to offer sacrifice and to pray for the
king and for them acknowledging their manifold sins

11 And these are the words of the book which Baruch the son of
Nerias the son of Maasias the son of Sedecias the son of Sedei the
son Helcias wrote in Babylonia

12 In the fifth year in the seventh day of the month at the time
that the Chaldeans took Jerusalem and burnt it with fire

13 And Baruch read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias
the son of Joakim king of Juda and in the hearing of all the people
that came to hear the book

14 And in the hearing of the nobles the sons of the kings and in
the hearing of the ancients and in the hearing of the people from the
least even to the greatest of them that dwelt in Babylonia by the
river Sedi

15 And when they heard it they wept and fasted and prayed before
the Lord

16 And they made a collection of money according to every mans
power

17 And they sent it to Jerusalem to Joakim the priest the son of
Helcias the son of Salom and to the priests and to all the people
that were found with him in Jerusalem

18 At the time when he received the vessels of the temple of the
Lord which had been taken away out of the temple to return them into
the land of Juda the tenth day of the month Sivan the silver vessels
which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Juda had made

19 After that Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away
Jechonias and the princes and all the powerful men and the people of
the land from Jerusalem and brought them bound to Babylon

110 And they said Behold we have sent you money buy with it
holocausts and frankincense and make meat offerings and offerings
for sin at the altar of the Lord our God

111 And pray ye for the life of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon
and for the life of Balthasar his son that their days may be upon
earth as the days of heaven

112 And that the Lord may give us strength and enlighten our eyes
that we may live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor the king of
Babylon and under the shadow of Balthasar his son and may serve them
many days and may find favour in their sight

113 And pray ye for us to the Lord our God for we have sinned
against the Lord our God and his wrath is not turned away from us even
to this day

114 And read ye this book which we have sent to you to be read in
the temple of the Lord on feasts and proper days

115 And you shall say To the Lord our God belongeth justice but to
us confusion of our face as it is come to pass at this day to all
Juda and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem

116 To our kings and to our princes and to our priests and to our
prophets and to our fathers

117 We have sinned before the Lord our God and have not believed
him nor put our trust in him

118 And we were not obedient to him and we have not hearkened to the
voice of the Lord our God to walk in his commandments which he hath
given us

119 From the day that he brought our fathers out of the land of
Egypt even to this day we were disobedient to the Lord our God and
going astray we turned away from hearing his voice

120 And many evils have cleaved to us and the curses which the Lord
foretold by Moses his servant who brought our fathers out of the land
of Egypt to give us a land flowing with milk and honey as at this
day

121 And we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God
according to all the words of the prophets whom he sent to us

122 And we have gone away every man after the inclinations of his own
wicked heart to serve strange gods and to do evil in the sight of the
Lord our God



Baruch Chapter 2


A further confession of the sins of the people and of the justice of
God

21 Wherefore the Lord our God hath made good his word that he spoke
to us and to our judges that have judged Israel and to our kings and
to our princes and to all Israel and Juda

22 That the Lord would bring upon us great evils such as never
happened under heaven as they have come to pass in Jerusalem
according to the things that are written in the law of Moses

23 That a man should eat the flesh of his own son and the flesh of
his own daughter

24 And he hath delivered them up to be under the hand of all the
kings that are round about us to be a reproach and desolation among
all the people among whom the Lord hath scattered us

25 And we are brought under and are not uppermost because we have
sinned against the Lord our God by not obeying his voice

26 To the Lord our God belongeth justice but to us and to our
fathers confusion of face as at this day

27 For the Lord hath pronounced against us all these evils that are
come upon us

28 And we have not entreated the face of the Lord our God that we
might return every one of us from our most wicked ways

29 And the Lord hath watched over us for evil and hath brought it
upon us for the Lord is just in all his works which he hath commanded
us

210 And we have not hearkened to his voice to walk in the
commandments of the Lord which he hath set before us

211 And now O Lord God of Israel who hast brought thy people out of
the land of Egypt with a strong hand and with signs and with wonders
and with thy great power and with a mighty arm and hast made thee a
name as at this day

212 We have sinned we have done wickedly we have acted unjustly O
Lord our God against all thy justices

213 Let thy wrath be turned away from us for we are left a few among
the nations where thou hast scattered us

214 Hear O Lord our prayers and our petitions and deliver us for
thy own sake and grant that we may find favour in the sight of them
that have led us away

215 That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God and
that thy name is called upon Israel and upon his posterity

216 Look down upon us O Lord from thy holy house and incline thy
ear and hear us

217 Open thy eyes and behold for the dead that are in hell whose
spirit is taken away from their bowels shall not give glory and
justice to the Lord

Justice etc  They that are in hell shall not give justice to God
that is they shall not acknowledge and glorify his justice as penitent
sinners do upon earth

218 But the soul that is sorrowful for the greatness of evil she hath
done and goeth bowed down and feeble and the eyes that fail and the
hungry soul giveth glory and justice to thee the Lord

219 For it is not for the justices of our fathers that we pour out
our prayers and beg mercy in thy sight O Lord our God

220 But because thou hast sent out thy wrath and thy indignation
upon us as thou hast spoken by the hand of thy servants the prophets
saying

221 Thus saith the Lord Bow down your shoulder and your neck and
serve the king of Babylon and you shall remain in the land which I
have given to your fathers

222 But if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord your God to
serve the king of Babylon I will cause you to depart out of the cities
of Juda and from without Jerusalem

223 And I will take away from you the voice of mirth and the voice
of joy and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride
and all the land shall be without any footstep of inhabitants

224 And they hearkened not to thy voice to serve the king of
Babylon and thou hast made good thy words which thou spokest by the
hands of thy servants the prophets that the bones of our kings and
the bones of our fathers should be removed out of their place

225 And behold they are cast out to the heat of the sun and to the
frost of the night and they have died in grievous pains by famine
and by the sword and in banishment

226 And thou hast made the temple in which thy name was called upon
as it is at this day for the iniquity of the house of Israel and the
house of Juda

227 And thou hast dealt with us O Lord our God according to all thy
goodness and according to all that great mercy of thine

228 As thou spokest by the hand of thy servant Moses in the day when
thou didst command him to write thy law before the children of Israel

229 Saying If you will not hear my voice this great multitude shall
be turned into a very small number among the nations where I will
scatter them

230 For I know that the people will not hear me for they are a
people of a stiff neck but they shall turn to their heart in the land
of their captivity

231 And they shall know that I am the Lord their God and I will give
them a heart and they shall understand and ears and they shall hear

232 And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity and
shall be mindful of my name

233 And they shall turn away themselves from their stiff neck and
from their wicked deeds for they shall remember the way of their
fathers that sinned against me

234 And I will bring them back again into the land which I promised
with an oath to their fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob and they
shall be masters thereof and I will multiply them and they shall not
be diminished

235 And I will make with them another covenant that shall be
everlasting to be their God and they shall be my people and I will
no more remove my people the children of Israel out of the land that
I have given them



Baruch Chapter 3


They pray for mercy acknowledging that they are justly punished for
forsaking true wisdom A prophecy of Christ

31 And now O Lord Almighty the God of Israel the soul in anguish
and the troubled spirit crieth to thee

32 Hear O Lord and have mercy for thou art a merciful God and
have pity on us for we have sinned before thee

33 For thou remainest for ever and shall we perish everlastingly

34 O Lord Almighty the God of Israel hear now the prayer of the
dead of Israel and of their children that have sinned before thee
and have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God wherefore
evils have cleaved fast to us

35 Remember not the iniquities of our fathers but think upon thy
hand and upon thy name at this time

36 For thou art the Lord our God and we will praise thee O Lord

37 Because for this end thou hast put thy fear in our hearts to the
intent that we should call upon thy name and praise thee in our
captivity for we are converted from the iniquity of our fathers who
sinned before thee

38 And behold we are at this day in our captivity whereby thou hast
scattered us to be a reproach and a curse and an offence according
to all the iniquities of our fathers who departed from thee O Lord
our God

39 Hear O Israel the commandments of life give ear that thou
mayst learn wisdom

310 How happeneth it O Israel that thou art in thy enemies land

311 Thou art grown old in a strange country thou art defiled with
the dead thou art counted with them that go down into hell

312 Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom

313 For if thou hadst walked in the way of God thou hadst surely
dwelt in peace for ever

314 Learn where is wisdom where is strength where is understanding
that thou mayst know also where is length of days and life where is
the light of the eyes and peace

315 Who hath found out her place and who hath gone in to her
treasures

316 Where are the princes of the nations and they that rule over the
beasts that are upon the earth

317 That take their diversion with the birds of the air

318 That hoard up silver and gold wherein men trust and there is no
end of their getting who work in silver and are solicitous and their
works are unsearchable

319 They are cut off and are gone down to hell and others are risen
up in their place

320 Young men have seen the light and dwelt upon the earth but the
way of knowledge they have not known

321 Nor have they understood the paths thereof neither have their
children received it it is far from their face

322 It hath not been heard of in the land of Chanaan neither hath it
been seen in Theman

Theman  The capital city of Edom

323 The children of Agar also that search after the wisdom that is
of the earth the merchants of Merrha and of Theman and the tellers
of fables and searchers of prudence and understanding but the way of
wisdom they have not known neither have they remembered her paths

Agar  The mother of the Ismaelites

324 O Israel how great is the house of God and how vast is the
place of his possession

325 It is great and hath no end it is high and immense

326 There were the giants those renowned men that were from the
beginning of great stature expert in war

327 The Lord chose not them neither did they find the way of
knowledge therefore did they perish

328 And because they had not wisdom they perished through their
folly

329 Who hath gone up into heaven and taken her and brought her down
from the clouds

330 Who hath passed over the sea and found her and brought her
preferably to chosen gold

331 There is none that is able to know her ways nor that can search
out her paths

332 But he that knoweth all things knoweth her and hath found her
out with his understanding he that prepared the earth for evermore
and filled it with cattle and fourfooted beasts

333 He that sendeth forth the light and it goeth and hath called
it and it obeyeth him with trembling

334 And the stars have given light in their watches and rejoiced

335 They were called and they said Here we are and with
cheerfulness they have shined forth to him that made them

336 This is our God and there shall no other be accounted of in
comparison of him

337 He found out all the way of knowledge and gave it to Jacob his
servant and to Israel his beloved

338 Afterwards he was seen upon earth and conversed with men

Was seen upon earth etc  viz by the mystery of the incarnation by
means of which the son of God came visibly amongst us and conversed
with men The prophets often speak of things to come as if they were
past to express the certainty of the event of the things foretold



Baruch Chapter 4


The prophet exhorts to the keeping of the law of wisdom and encourages
the people to be patient and to hope for their deliverance

41 This is the book of the commandments of God and the law that is
for ever all they that keep it shall come to life but they that have
forsaken it to death

42 Return O Jacob and take hold of it walk in the way by its
brightness in the presence of the light thereof

43 Give not thy honour to another nor thy dignity to a strange
nation

44 We are happy O Israel because the things that are pleasing to
God are made known to us

45 Be of good comfort O people of God the memorial of Israel

46 You have been sold to the Gentiles not for your destruction but
because you provoked God to wrath you are delivered to your
adversaries

47 For you have provoked him who made you the eternal God offering
sacrifice to devils and not to God

48 For you have forgotten God who brought you up and you have
grieved Jerusalem that nursed you

49 For she saw the wrath of God coming upon you and she said Give
ear all you that dwell near Sion for God hath brought upon me great
mourning

410 For I have seen the captivity of my people of my sons and my
daughters which the Eternal hath brought upon them

411 For I nourished them with joy but I sent them away with weeping
and mourning

412 Let no man rejoice over me a widow and desolate I am forsaken
of many for the sins of my children because they departed from the law
of God

413 And they have not known his justices nor walked by the ways of
Gods commandments neither have they entered by the paths of his truth
and justice

414 Let them that dwell about Sion come and remember the captivity
of my sons and daughters which the Eternal hath brought upon them

415 For he hath brought a nation upon them from afar a wicked
nation and of a strange tongue

416 Who have neither reverenced the ancient nor pitied children and
have carried away the beloved of the widow and have left me all alone
without children

417 But as for me what help can I give you

418 But he that hath brought the evils upon you he will deliver you
out of the hands of your enemies

419 Go your way my children go your way for I am left alone

420 I have put off the robe of peace and have put upon me the
sackcloth of supplication and I will cry to the most High in my days

421 Be of good comfort my children cry to the Lord and he will
deliver you out of the hand of the princes your enemies

422 For my hope is in the Eternal that he will save you and joy is
come upon me from the Holy One because of the mercy which shall come
to you from our everlasting Saviour

423 For I sent you forth with mourning and weeping but the Lord will
bring you back to me with joy and gladness for ever

424 For as the neighbours of Sion have now seen your captivity from
God so shall they also shortly see your salvation from God which
shall come upon you with great honour and everlasting glory

425 My children suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you
for thy enemy hath persecuted thee but thou shalt quickly see his
destruction and thou shalt get up upon his neck

426 My delicate ones have walked rough ways for they were taken away
as a flock made a prey by the enemies

427 Be of good comfort my children and cry to the Lord for you
shall be remembered by him that hath led you away

428 For as it was your mind to go astray from God so when you return
again you shall seek him ten times as much

429 For he that hath brought evils upon you shall bring you
everlasting joy again with your salvation

430 Be of good heart O Jerusalem for he exhorteth thee that named
thee

431 The wicked that have afflicted thee shall perish and they that
have rejoiced at thy ruin shall be punished

432 The cities which thy children have served shall be punished and
she that received thy sons

She that received etc  viz Babylon

433 For as she rejoiced at thy ruin and was glad of thy fall so
shall she be grieved for her own desolation

434 And the joy of her multitude shall be cut off and her gladness
shall be turned to mourning

435 For fire shall come upon her from the Eternal long to endure
and she shall be inhabited by devils for a great time

436 Look about thee O Jerusalem towards the east and behold the
joy that cometh to thee from God

437 For behold thy children come whom thou sentest away scattered
they come gathered together from the east even to the west at the word
of the Holy One rejoicing for the honour of God



Baruch Chapter 5


Jerusalem is invited to rejoice and behold the return of her children
out of their captivity

51 Put off O Jerusalem the garment of thy mourning and affliction
and put on the beauty and honour of that everlasting glory which thou
hast from God

52 God will clothe thee with the double garment of justice and will
set a crown on thy head of everlasting honour

53 For God will shew his brightness in thee to every one under
heaven

54 For thy name shall be named to thee by God for ever the peace of
justice and honour of piety

55 Arise O Jerusalem and stand on high and look about towards the
east and behold thy children gathered together from the rising to the
setting sun by the word of the Holy One rejoicing in the remembrance
of God

56 For they went out from thee on foot led by the enemies but the
Lord will bring them to thee exalted with honour as children of the
kingdom

57 For God hath appointed to bring down every high mountain and the
everlasting rocks and to fill up the valleys to make them even with
the ground that Israel may walk diligently to the honour of God

58 Moreover the woods and every sweetsmelling tree have overshadowed
Israel by the commandment of God

59 For God will bring Israel with joy in the light of his majesty
with mercy and justice that cometh from him



Baruch Chapter 6


The epistle of Jeremias to the captives as a preservative against
idolatry

A copy of the epistle that Jeremias sent to them that were to be led
away captives into Babylon by the king of Babylon to declare to them
according to what was commanded him by God

61 For the sins that you have committed before God you shall be
carried away captives into Babylon by Nabuchodonosor the king of
Babylon

62 And when you are come into Babylon you shall be there many years
and for a long time even to seven generations and after that I will
bring you away from thence with peace

Seven generations  That is seventy years

63 But now you shall see in Babylon gods of gold and of silver and
of stone and of wood borne upon shoulders causing fear to the
Gentiles

64 Beware therefore that you imitate not the doings of others and be
afraid and the fear of them should seize upon you

65 But when you see the multitude behind and before adoring them
say you in your hearts Thou oughtest to be adored O Lord

66 For my angel is with you And I myself will demand an account of
your souls

67 For their tongue that is polished by the craftsman and themselves
laid over with gold and silver are false things and they cannot
speak

68 And as if it were for a maiden that loveth to go gay so do they
take gold and make them up

69 Their gods have golden crowns upon their heads whereof the
priests secretly convey away from them gold and silver and bestow it
on themselves

610 Yea and they give thereof to prostitutes and they dress out
harlots and again when they receive it of the harlots they adorn
their gods

611 And these gods cannot defend themselves from the rust and the
moth

612 But when they have covered them with a purple garment they wipe
their face because of the dust of the house which is very much among
them

613 This holdeth a sceptre as a man as a judge of the country but
cannot put to death one that offendeth him

614 And this hath in his hand a sword or an axe but cannot save
himself from war or from robbers whereby be it known to you that
they are not gods

615 Therefore fear them not For as a vessel that a man uses when it
is broken becometh useless even so are their gods

616 When they are placed in the house their eyes are full of dust by
the feet of them that go in

617 And as the gates are made sure on every side upon one that hath
offended the king or like a dead man carried to the grave so do the
priests secure the doors with bars and locks lest they be stripped by
thieves

618 They light candles to them and in great number of which they
cannot see one but they are like beams in the house

619 And they say that the creeping things which are of the earth
gnaw their hearts while they eat them and their garments and they
feel it not

620 Their faces are black with the smoke that is made in the house

621 Owls and swallows and other birds fly upon their bodies and
upon their heads and cats in like manner

622 Whereby you may know that they are no gods Therefore fear them
not

623 The gold also which they have is for shew but except a man wipe
off the rust they will not shine for neither when they were molten
did they feel it

624 Men buy them at a high price whereas there is no breath in them

625 And having not the use of feet they are carried upon shoulders
declaring to men how vile they are Be they confounded also that
worship them

626 Therefore if they fall to the ground they rise not up again of
themselves nor if a man set them upright will they stand by
themselves but their gifts shall be set before them as to the dead

627 The things that are sacrificed to them their priests sell and
abuse in like manner also their wives take part of them but give
nothing of it either to the sick or to the poor

628 The childbearing and menstruous women touch their sacrifices
knowing therefore by these things that they are not gods fear them
not

629 For how can they be called gods because women set offerings
before the gods of silver and of gold and of wood

630 And priests sit in their temples having their garments rent and
their heads and beards shaven and nothing upon their heads

631 And they roar and cry before their gods as men do at the feast
when one is dead

632 The priests take away their garments and clothe their wives and
their children

633 And whether it be evil that one doth unto them or good they are
not able to recompense it neither can they set up a king nor put him
down

634 In like manner they can neither give riches nor requite evil If
a man make a vow to them and perform it not they cannot require it

635 They cannot deliver a man from death nor save the weak from the
mighty

636 They cannot restore the blind man to his sight nor deliver a man
from distress

367 They shall not pity the widow nor do good to the fatherless

638 Their gods of wood and of stone and of gold and of silver
are like the stones that are hewn out of the mountains and they that
worship them shall be confounded

639 How then is it to be supposed or to be said that they are gods

640 Even the Chaldeans themselves dishonor them who when they here
of one dumb that cannot speak they present him to Bel entreating him
that he may speak

641 As though they could be sensible that have no motion themselves
and they when they shall perceive this will leave them for their
gods themselves have no sense

642 The women also with cords about them sit in the ways burning
olivestones

643 And when any one of them drawn away by some passenger lieth
with him she upbraideth her neighbor that she was not thought as
worthy as herself nor her cord broken

644 But all things that are done about them are false how is it
then to be thought or to be said that they are gods

645 And they are made by workmen and by goldsmiths They shall be
nothing else but what the priests will have them to be

646 For the artificers themselves that make them are of no long
continuance Can those things then that are made by them be gods

647 But they have left false things and reproach to them that come
after

648 For when war cometh upon them  or evils the priests consult
with themselves where they may hide themselves with them

649 How then can they be thought to be gods that can neither deliver
themselves from war nor save themselves from evils

650 For seeing they are but of wood and laid over with gold and
with silver it shall be known hereafter that they are false things by
all nations and kings and it shall be manifest that they are no gods
but the work of mens hands and that there is no work of God in them

651 Whence therefore is it known that they are not gods but the
work of mens hands and no work of God is in them

652 They cannot set up a king over the land nor give rain to men

653 They determine no causes nor deliver countries from oppression
because they can do nothing and are as daws between heaven and earth

654 For when fire shall fall upon the house of these gods of wood
and of silver and of gold their priests indeed will flee away and be
saved but they themselves shall be burnt in the midst like beams

655 And they cannot withstand a king and war How then can it be
supposed or admitted that they are gods

656 Neither are these gods of wood and of stone and laid over with
gold and with silver able to deliver themselves from thieves or
robbers they that are stronger than them

They that are stronger than them  That is robbers and thieves are
stronger than these idols being things without life or motion

657 Shall take from them the gold and silver and the raiment
wherewith they are clothed and shall go their way neither shall they
help themselves

658 Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power or
else a profitable vessel in the house with which the owner thereof
will be well satisfied or a door in the house to keep things safe
that are therein than such false gods

659 The sun and the moon and the stars being bright and sent forth
for profitable uses are obedient

660 In like manner the lightning when it breaketh forth is easy to
be seen and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country

661 And the clouds when God commandeth them to go over the whole
world do that which is commanded them

662 The fire also being sent from above to consume mountains and
woods doth as it is commanded But these neither in shew nor in
power are alike to any one of them

663 Wherefore it is neither to be thought nor to be said that they
are gods since they are neither able to judge causes nor to do any
good to men

664 Knowing therefore that they are not gods fear them not

665 For neither can they curse kings nor bless them

666 Neither do they shew signs in the heaven to the nations nor
shine as the sun nor give light as the moon

667 Beasts are better than they which can fly under a covert and
help themselves

668 Therefore there is no manner of appearance that they are gods so
fear them not

669 For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing so
are their gods of wood and of silver and laid over with gold

670 They are no better than a white thorn in a garden upon which
every bird sitteth In like manner also their gods of wood and laid
over with gold and with silver are like to a dead body cast forth in
the dark

671 By the purple also and the scarlet which are motheaten upon them
you shall know that they are not gods And they themselves at last are
consumed and shall be a reproach in the country

672 Better therefore is the just man that hath no idols for he
shall be far from reproach




THE PROPHECY OF EZECHIEL



EZECHIEL whose name signifies the STRENGTH OF GOD was of the priestly
race and of the number of captives that were carried away to Babylon
with king JOACHIN He was contemporary with JEREMIAS and prophesied to
the same effect in Babylon as JEREMIAS did in Jerusalem and is said
to have ended his days in like manner by martyrdom



Ezechiel Chapter 1


The time of Ezechiels prophecy he sees a glorious vision

11 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month on
the fifth day of the month when I was in the midst of the captives by
the river Chobar the heavens were opened and I saw the visions of
God

The thirtieth year  Either of the age of Ezechiel or as others will
have it from the solemn covenant made in the eighteenth year of the
reign of Josias 4 Kings 23

12 On the fifth day of the month the same was the fifth year of the
captivity of king Joachin

13 The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel the priest the son of Buzi
in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chobar and the hand of the
Lord was there upon him

14 And I saw and behold a whirlwind came out of the north and a
great cloud and a fire infolding it and brightness was about it and
out of the midst thereof that is out of the midst of the fire as it
were the resemblance of amber

15 And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures
and this was their appearance there was the likeness of a man in them

Living creatures  Cherubims as appears from Ecclesiasticus 4910
represented to the prophet under these mysterious shapes as supporting
the throne of God and as it were drawing his chariot All this chapter
appeared so obscure and so full of mysteries to the ancient Hebrews
that as we learn from St Jerome Ep ad Paulin they suffered none
to read it before they were thirty years old

16 Every one had four faces and every one four wings

17 Their feet were straight feet and the sole of their foot was like
the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like the appearance of
glowing brass

18 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four
sides and they had faces and wings on the four sides

19 And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another They
turned not when they went but every one went straight forward

110 And as for the likeness of their faces there was the face of a
man and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four and the
face of an ox on the left side of all the four and the face of an
eagle over all the four

111 And their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings
of every one were joined and two covered their bodies

112 And every one of them went straight forward whither the impulse
of the spirit was to go thither they went and they turned not when
they went

113 And as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance
was like that of burning coals of fire and like the appearance of
lamps This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the
living creatures a bright fire and lightning going forth from the
fire

114 And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of
lightning

115 Now as I beheld the living creatures there appeared upon the
earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces

116 And the appearance of the wheels and the work of them was like
the appearance of the sea and the four had all one likeness and their
appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a
wheel

117 When they went they went by their four parts and they turned
not when they went

When they went they went by their four parts  That is indifferently
to any of their sides either forward or backward to the right or to
the left

118 The wheels had also a size and a height and a dreadful
appearance and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the
four

119 And when the living creatures went the wheels also went
together by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the
earth the wheels also were lifted up with them

120 Withersoever the spirit went thither as the spirit went the
wheels also were lifted up withal and followed it for the spirit of
life was in the wheels

121 When those went these went and when those stood these stood and
when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up
together and followed them for the spirit of life was in the wheels

122 And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of
the firmament the appearance of crystal terrible to behold and
stretched out over their heads above

123 And under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward
the other every one with two wings covered his body and the other was
covered in like manner

124 And I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of many
waters as it were the voice of the most high God when they walked it
was like the voice of a multitude like the noise of an army and when
they stood their wings were let down

125 For when a voice came from above the firmament that was over
their heads they stood and let down their wings

126 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the
likeness of a throne as the appearance of the sapphire stone and upon
the likeness of the throne was the likeness of the appearance of a man
above upon it

127 And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance
of fire within it round about from his loins and upward and from his
loins downward I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round
about

128 As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy
day this was the appearance of the brightness round about



Ezechiel Chapter 2


The prophet receives his commission

21 This was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord and
I saw and I fell upon my face and I heard the voice of one that
spoke and he said to me Son of man stand upon thy feet and I will
speak to thee

22 And the spirit entered into me after that he spoke to me and he
set me upon my feet and I heard him speaking to me

23 And saying Son of man I send thee to the children of Israel to
a rebellious people that hath revolted from me they and their
fathers have transgressed my covenant even unto this day

24 And they to whom I send thee are children of a hard face and of
an obstinate heart and thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord
God

25 If so be they at least will hear and if so be they will forbear
for they are a provoking house and they shall know that there hath
been a prophet in the midst of them

26 And thou O son of man fear not neither be thou afraid of their
words for thou art among unbelievers and destroyers and thou dwellest
with scorpions Fear not their words neither be thou dismayed at their
looks for they are a provoking house

27 And thou shalt speak my words to them if perhaps they will hear
and forbear for they provoke me to anger

28 But thou O son of man hear all that I say to thee and do not
thou provoke me as that house provoketh me open thy mouth and eat
what I give thee

29 And I looked and behold a hand was sent to me wherein was a
book rolled up and he spread it before me and it was written within
and without and there were written in it lamentations and canticles
and woe



Ezechiel Chapter 3


The prophet eats the book and receives further instructions the
office of a watchman

31 And he said to me Son of man eat all that thou shalt find eat
this book and go speak to the children of Israel

Eat this book and go speak to the children of Israel  By this eating
of the book was signified the diligent attention and affection with
which we are to receive and embrace the word of God and to let it as
it were sink into our interior by devout meditation

32 And I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that book

33 And he said to me Son of man thy belly shall eat and thy bowels
shall be filled with this book which I give thee and I did eat it
and it was sweet as honey in my mouth

34 And he said to me Son of man go to the house of Israel and thou
shalt speak my words to them

35 For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech and of an
unknown tongue but to the house of Israel

36 Nor to many nations of a strange speech and of an unknown tongue
whose words thou canst not understand and if thou wert sent to them
they would hearken to thee

37 But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee because they
will not hearken to me for all the house of Israel are of a hard
forehead and an obstinate heart

38 Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces and thy
forehead harder than their foreheads

39 I have made thy face like an adamant and like flint fear them
not neither be thou dismayed at their presence for they are a
provoking house

310 And he said to me Son of man receive in thy heart and hear
with thy ears all the words that I speak to thee

311 And go get thee in to them of the captivity to the children of
thy people and thou shalt speak to them and shalt say to them Thus
saith the Lord If so be they will hear and will forbear

312 And the spirit took me up and I heard behind me the voice of a
great commotion saying Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his
place

313 The noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one
against another and the noise of the wheels following the living
creatures and the noise of a great commotion

314 The spirit also lifted me and took me up and I went away in
bitterness in the indignation of my spirit for the hand of the Lord
was with me strengthening me

315 And I came to them of the captivity to the heap of new corn to
them that dwelt by the river Chobar and I sat where they sat and I
remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them

The heap of new corn  It was the name of a place in Hebrew tel
abib

316 And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me
saying

317 Son of man I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel
and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth and shalt tell it them
from me

318 If when I say to the wicked Thou shalt surely die thou declare
it not to him nor speak to him that he may be converted from his
wicked way and live the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity
but I will require his blood at thy hand

319 But if thou give warning to the wicked and he be not converted
from his wickedness and from his evil way he indeed shall die in his
iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul

320 Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice and
shall commit iniquity I will lay a stumblingblock before him he shall
die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin
and his justices which he hath done shall not be remembered but I
will require his blood at thy hand

321 But if thou warn the just man that the just may not sin and he
doth not sin living he shall live because thou hast warned him and
thou hast delivered thy soul

322 And the hand of the Lord was upon me and he said to me Rise and
go forth into the plain and there I will speak to thee

323 And I rose up and went forth into the plain and behold the
glory of the Lord stood there like the glory which I saw by the river
Chobar and I fell upon my face

324 And the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and he
spoke to me and said to me Go in and shut thyself up in the midst of
thy house

325 And thou O son of man behold they shall put bands upon thee
and they shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go forth from
the midst of them

326 And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth
and thou shalt be dumb and not as a man that reproveth because they
are a provoking house

327 But when I shall speak to thee I will open thy mouth and thou
shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord God He that heareth let him
hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a provoking
house



Ezechiel Chapter 4


A prophetic description of the siege of Jerusalem and the famine that
shall reign there

41 And thou O son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee
and draw upon it the plan of the city of Jerusalem

42 And lay siege against it and build forts and cast up a mount
and set a camp against it and place battering rams round about it

43 And take unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron
between thee and the city and set thy face resolutely against it and
it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it it is a sign
to the house of Israel

44 And thou shalt sleep upon thy left side and shalt lay the
iniquities of the house of Israel upon it according to the number of
the days that thou shalt sleep upon it and thou shalt take upon thee
their iniquity

45 And I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according
to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days and thou shalt
bear the iniquity of the house of Israel

46 And when thou hast accomplished this thou shalt sleep again upon
thy right side and thou shalt take upon thee the iniquity of the house
of Juda forty days a day for a year yea a day for a year I have
appointed to thee

47 And thou shalt turn thy face to the siege of Jerusalem and thy arm
shall be stretched out and thou shalt prophesy against it

48 Behold I have encompassed thee with bands and thou shalt not turn
thyself from one side to the other till thou hast ended the days of
thy siege

49 And take to thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and
millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread
thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon
thy side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof

410 And thy meat that thou shalt eat shall be in weight twenty
staters a day from time to time thou shalt eat it

411 And thou shalt drink water by measure the sixth part of a hin
from time to time thou shalt drink it

Hin  That is a measure of liquids containing about ten pints

412 And thou shalt eat it as barley bread baked under the ashes and
thou shalt cover it in their sight with the dung that cometh out of a
man

413 And the Lord said So shall the children of Israel eat their
bread all filthy among the nations whither I will cast them out

414 And I said Ah ah ah O Lord God behold my soul hath not been
defiled and from my infancy even till now I have not eaten any thing
that died of itself or was torn by beasts and no unclean flesh hath
entered into my mouth

415 And he said to me Behold I have given thee neats dung for mans
dung and thou shalt make thy bread therewith

416 And he said to me Son of man Behold I will break in pieces the
staff of bread in Jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and
with care and they shall drink water by measure and in distress

417 So that when bread and water fail every man may fall against his
brother and they may pine away in their iniquities



Ezechiel Chapter 5


The judgments of God upon the Jews are foreshewn under the type of the
prophets hair

51 And thou son of man take thee a sharp knife that shaveth the
hair and cause it to pass over thy head and over thy beard and take
thee a balance to weigh in and divide the hair

52 A third part thou shalt burn with fire in the midst of the city
according to the fulfilling of the days of the siege and thou shalt
take a third part and cut it in pieces with the knife all round about
and the other third part thou shalt scatter in the wind and I will
draw out the sword after them

53 And thou shalt take thereof a small number and shalt bind them in
the skirt of thy cloak

54 And thou shalt take of them again and shalt cast them in the
midst of the fire and shalt burn them with fire and out of it shall
come forth a fire into all the house of Israel

55 Thus saith the Lord God This is Jerusalem I have set her in the
midst of the nations and the countries round about her

56 And she hath despised my judgments so as to be more wicked than
the Gentiles and my commandments more than the countries that are
round about her for they have cast off my judgments and have not
walked in my commandments

57 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because you have surpassed the
Gentiles that are round about you and have not walked in my
commandments and have not kept my judgments and have not done
according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you

58 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold I come against thee and
I myself will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of
the Gentiles

59 And I will do in thee that which I have not done and the like to
which I will do no more because of all thy abominations

510 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee
and the sons shall eat their fathers and I will execute judgments in
thee and I will scatter thy whole remnant into every wind

511 Therefore as I live saith the Lord God Because thou hast
violated my sanctuary with all thy offences and with all thy
abominations I will also break thee in pieces and my eye shall not
spare and I will not have any pity

512 A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and shall be
consumed with famine in the midst of thee and a third part of thee
shall fall by the sword round about thee and a third part of thee will
I scatter into every wind and I will draw out a sword after them

513 And I will accomplish my fury and will cause my indignation to
rest upon them and I will be comforted and they shall know that I the
Lord have spoken it in my zeal when I shall have accomplished my
indignation in them

514 And I will make thee desolate and a reproach among the nations
that are round about thee in the sight of every one that passeth by

515 And thou shalt be a reproach and a scoff an example and an
astonishment amongst the nations that are round about thee when I
shall have executed judgments in thee in anger and in indignation and
in wrathful rebukes

516 I the Lord have spoken it When I shall send upon them the
grievous arrows of famine which shall bring death and which I will
send to destroy you and I will gather together famine against you and
I will break among you the staff of bread

517 And I will send in upon you famine and evil beasts unto utter
destruction and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and I
will bring in the sword upon thee I the Lord have spoken it



Ezechiel Chapter 6


The punishment of Israel for their idolatry a remnant shall be saved

61 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

62 Son of man set thy face towards the mountains of Israel and
prophesy against them

63 And say Ye mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord God
Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains and to the hills and to the
rocks and the valleys Behold I will bring upon you the sword and I
will destroy your high places

64 And I will throw down your altars and your idols shall be broken
in pieces and I will cast down your slain before your idols

65 And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before
your idols and I will scatter your bones round about your altars

66 In all your dwelling places The cities shall be laid waste and
the high places shall be thrown down and destroyed and your altars
shall be abolished and shall be broken in pieces and your idols shall
be no more and your temples shall be destroyed and your works shall
be defaced

67 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you and you shall know
that I am the Lord

68 And I will leave in you some that shall escape the sword among the
nations when I shall have scattered you through the countries

69 And they that are saved of you shall remember me amongst the
nations to which they are carried captives because I have broken
their heart that was faithless and revolted from me and their eyes
that went a fornicating after their idols and they shall be displeased
with themselves because of the evils which they have committed in all
their abominations

610 And they shall know that I the Lord have not spoken in vain that
I would do this evil to them

611 Thus saith the Lord God Strike with thy hand and stamp with thy
foot and say Alas for all the abominations of the evils of the house
of Israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the
pestilence

612 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is
near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged
shall die by the famine and I will accomplish my indignation upon
them

613 And you shall know that I am the Lord when your slain shall be
amongst your idols round about your altars in every high hill and on
all the tops of mountains and under every woody tree and under every
thick oak the place where they burnt sweet smelling frankincense to
all their idols

614 And I will stretch forth my hand upon them and I will make the
land desolate and abandoned from the desert of Deblatha in all their
dwelling places and they shall know that I am the Lord



Ezechiel Chapter 7


The final desolation of Israel from which few shall escape

71 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

72 And thou son of man thus saith the Lord God to the land of
Israel The end is come the end is come upon the four quarters of the
land

73 Now is an end come upon thee and I will send my wrath upon thee
and I will judge thee according to thy ways and I will set all thy
abominations against thee

74 And my eye shall not spare thee and I will shew thee no pity but
I will lay thy ways upon thee and thy abominations shall be in the
midst of thee and you shall know that I am the Lord

75 Thus saith the Lord God One affliction behold an affliction is
come

76 An end is come the end is come it hath awaked against thee
behold it is come

77 Destruction is come upon thee that dwellest in the land the time
is come the day of slaughter is near and not of the joy of mountains

78 Now very shortly I will pour out my wrath upon thee and I will
accomplish my anger in thee and I will judge thee according to thy
ways and I will lay upon thee all thy crimes

79 And my eye shall not spare neither will I shew mercy but I will
lay thy ways upon thee and thy abominations shall be in the midst of
thee and you shall know that I am the Lord that strike

710 Behold the day behold it is come destruction is gone forth the
rod hath blossomed pride hath budded

711 Iniquity is risen up into a rod of impiety nothing of them shall
remain nor of their people nor of the noise of them and there shall
be no rest among them

712 The time is come the day is at hand let not the buyer rejoice
nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the people thereof

713 For the seller shall not return to that which he hath sold
although their life be yet among the living For the vision which
regardeth all the multitude thereof shall not go back neither shall
man be strengthened in the iniquity of his life

714 Blow the trumpet let all be made ready yet there is none to go
to the battle for my wrath shall be upon all the people thereof

715 The sword without and the pestilence and the famine within he
that is in the field shall die by the sword and they that are in the
city shall be devoured by the pestilence and the famine

716 And such of them as shall flee shall escape and they shall be in
the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them trembling every
one for his iniquity

717 All hands shall be made feeble and all knees shall run with
water

718 And they shall gird themselves with haircloth and fear shall
cover them and shame shall be upon every face and baldness upon all
their heads

719 Their silver shall be cast forth and their gold shall become a
dunghill Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them
in the day of the wrath of the Lord They shall not satisfy their soul
and their bellies shall not be filled because it hath been the
stumblingblock of their iniquity

720 And they have turned the ornament of their jewels into pride and
have made of it the images of their abominations and idols therefore
I have made it an uncleanness to them

721 And I will give it into the hands of strangers for spoil and to
the wicked of the earth for a prey and they shall defile it

722 And I will turn away my face from them and they shall violate my
secret place and robbers shall enter into it and defile it

Secret place etc  Viz the inward sanctuary the holy of holies

723 Make a shutting up for the land is full of the judgment of
blood and the city is full of iniquity

Make a shutting up  In Hebrew a chain viz for imprisonment and
captivity

724 And I will bring the worst of the nations and they shall possess
their houses and I will make the pride of the mighty to cease and
they shall possess their sanctuary

725 When distress cometh upon them they will seek for peace and
there shall be none

726 Trouble shall come upon trouble and rumour upon rumour and they
shall seek a vision of the prophet and the law shall perish from the
priest and counsel from the ancients

727 The king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with
sorrow and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled I
will do to them according to their way and will judge them according
to their judgments and they shall know that I am the Lord



Ezechiel Chapter 8


The prophet sees in a vision the abominations committed in Jerusalem
which determine the Lord to spare them no longer

81 And it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the
fifth day of the month as I sat in my house and the ancients of Juda
sat before me that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me

82 And I saw and behold a likeness as the appearance of fire from
the appearance of his loins and downward fire and from his loins
and upward as the appearance of brightness as the appearance of
amber

83 And the likeness of a hand was put forth and took me by a lock of
my head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven
and brought me in the vision of God into Jerusalem near the inner
gate that looked toward the north where was set the idol of jealousy
to provoke to jealousy

84 And behold the glory of the God of Israel was there according to
the vision which I had seen in the plain

85 And he said to me Son of man lift up thy eyes towards the way of
the north and I lifted up my eyes towards the way of the north and
behold on the north side of the gate of the altar the idol of jealousy
in the very entry

86 And he said to me Son of man dost thou see thinkest thou what
these are doing the great abominations that the house of Israel
committeth here that I should depart far off from my sanctuary and
turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations

87 And he brought me in to the door of the court and I saw and
behold a hole in the wall

88 And he said to me Son of man dig in the wall and when I had
digged in the wall behold a door

89 And he said to me Go in and see the wicked abominations which
they commit here

810 And I went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things
and of living creatures the abominations and all the idols of the
house of Israel were painted on the wall all round about

811 And seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel and
Jezonias the son of Saaphan stood in the midst of them that stood
before the pictures and every one had a censer in his hand and a
cloud of smoke went up from the incense

812 And he said to me Surely thou seest O son of man what the
ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark every one in private in
his chamber for they say The Lord seeth us not the Lord hath
forsaken the earth

813 And he said to me If thou turn thee again thou shalt see
greater abominations which these commit

814 And he brought me in by the door of the gate of the Lords house
which looked to the north and behold women sat there mourning for
Adonis

Adonis  The favourite of Venus slain by a wild boar as feigned by
the heathen poets and which being here represented by an idol is
lamented by the female worshippers of that goddess In the Hebrew the
name is Tammuz

815 And he said to me Surely thou hast seen O son of man but turn
thee again thou shalt see greater abominations than these

816 And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord
and behold at the door of the temple of the Lord between the porch and
the altar were about five and twenty men having their backs towards
the temple of the Lord in their faces to the east and they adored
towards the rising of the sun

817 And he said to me Surely thou hast seen O son of man is this a
light thing to the house of Juda that they should commit these
abominations which they have committed here because they have filled
the land with iniquity and have turned to provoke me to anger and
behold they put a branch to their nose

818 Therefore I also will deal with them in my wrath my eye shall
not spare them neither will I shew mercy and when they shall cry to
my ears with a loud voice I will not hear them



Ezechiel Chapter 9


All are ordered to be destroyed that are not marked in their foreheads
God will not be entreated for them

91 And he cried in my ears with a loud voice saying The visitations
of the city are at hand and every one hath a destroying weapon in his
hand

92 And behold six men came from the way of the upper gate which
looketh to the north and each one had his weapon of destruction in his
hand and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with linen
with a writers inkhorn at his reins and they went in and stood by
the brazen altar

93 And the glory of the Lord of Israel went up from the cherub upon
which he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man
that was clothed with linen and had a writers inkhorn at his loins

94 And the Lord said to him Go through the midst of the city
through the midst of Jerusalem and mark Thau upon the foreheads of the
men that sigh and mourn for all the abominations that are committed in
the midst thereof

Mark Thau  Thau or Tau is the last letter in the Hebrew alphabet
and signifies a sign or a mark which is the reason why some
translators render this place set a mark or mark a mark without
specifying what this mark was But St Jerome and other interpreters
conclude it was the form of the letter Thau which in the ancient
Hebrew character was the form of a cross

95 And to the others he said in my hearing Go ye after him through
the city and strike let not your eyes spare nor be ye moved with
pity

96 Utterly destroy old and young maidens children and women but
upon whomsoever you shall see Thau kill him not and begin ye at my
sanctuary So they began at the ancient men who were before the house

97 And he said to them Defile the house and fill the courts with
the slain go ye forth And they went forth and slew them that were in
the city

98 And the slaughter being ended I was left and I fell upon my face
and crying I said Alas alas alas O Lord God wilt thou then
destroy all the remnant of Israel by pouring out thy fury upon
Jerusalem

99 And he said to me The iniquity of the house of Israel and of
Juda is exceeding great and the land is filled with blood and the
city is filled with perverseness for they have said The Lord hath
forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth not

910 Therefore neither shall my eye spare nor will I have pity I
will requite their way upon their head

911 And behold the man that was clothed with linen that had the
inkhorn at his back returned the word saying I have done as thou
hast commanded me



Ezechiel Chapter 10


Fire is taken from the midst of the wheels under the cherubims and
scattered over the city A description of the cherubims

101 And I saw and behold in the firmament that was over the heads of
the cherubims there appeared over them as it were the sapphire stone
as the appearance of the likeness of a throne

102 And he spoke to the man that was clothed with linen and said
Go in between the wheels that are under the cherubims and fill thy hand
with the coals of fire that are between the cherubims and pour them
out upon the city And he went in in my sight

103 And the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the
man went in and a cloud filled the inner court

104 And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from above the cherub to
the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud
and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord

105 And the sound of the wings of the cherubims was heard even to the
outward court as the voice of God Almighty speaking

106 And when he had commanded the man that was clothed with linen
saying Take fire from the midst of the wheels that are between the
cherubims he went in and stood beside the wheel

107 And one cherub stretched out his arm from the midst of the
cherubims to the fire that was between the cherubims and he took and
put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen who took it
and went forth

108 And there appeared in the cherubims the likeness of a mans hand
under their wings

109 And I saw and behold there were four wheels by the cherubims
one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and the
appearance of the wheels was to the sight like the chrysolite stone

1010 And as to their appearance all four were alike as if a wheel
were in the midst of a wheel

1011 And when they went they went by four ways and they turned not
when they went but to the place whither they first turned the rest
also followed and did not turn back

By four ways  That is by any of the four ways forward backward to
the right or to the left

1012 And their whole body and their necks and their hands and
their wings and the circles were full of eyes round about the four
wheels

1013 And these wheels he called voluble in my hearing

Voluble  That is rolling wheels galgal

1014 And every one had four faces one face was the face of a cherub
and the second face the face of a man and in the third was the face
of a lion and in the fourth the face of an eagle

1015 And the cherubims were lifted up this is the living creature
that I had seen by the river Chobar

1016 And when the cherubims went the wheels also went by them and
when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth
the wheels stayed not behind but were by them

1017 When they stood these stood and when they were lifted up
these were lifted up for the spirit of life was in them

1018 And the glory of the Lord went forth from the threshold of the
temple and stood over the cherubims

1019 And the cherubims lifting up their wings were raised from the
earth before me and as they went out the wheels also followed and it
stood in the entry of the east gate of the house of the Lord and the
glory of the God of Israel was over them

1020 This is the living creature which I saw under the God of Israel
by the river Chobar and I understood that they were cherubims

1021 Each one had four faces and each one had four wings and the
likeness of a mans hand was under their wings

1022 And as to the likeness of their faces they were the same faces
which I had seen by the river Chobar and their looks and the impulse
of every one to go straight forward



Ezechiel Chapter 11


A prophecy against the presumptuous assurance of the great ones A
remnant shall be saved and receive a new spirit and a new heart

111 And the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the east gate of
the house of the Lord which looketh towards the rising of the sun and
behold in the entry of the gate five and twenty men and I saw in the
midst of them Jezonias the son of Azur and Pheltias the son of
Banaias princes of the people

112 And he said to me Son of man these are the men that study
iniquity and frame a wicked counsel in this city

113 Saying Were not houses lately built This city is the caldron
and we the flesh

Were not houses lately built etc  These men despised the predictions
and threats of the prophets who declared to them from God that the
city should be destroyed and the inhabitants carried into captivity
and they made use of this kind of argument against the prophets that
the city so far from being like to be destroyed had lately been
augmented by the building of new houses from whence they further
inferred by way of a proverb using the similitude of a cauldron out
of which the flesh is not taken till it is thoroughly boiled and fit
to be eaten that they should not be carried away out of their city
but there end their days in peace

114 Therefore prophesy against them prophesy thou son of man

115 And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me and said to me Speak
Thus saith the Lord Thus have you spoken O house of Israel for I
know the thoughts of your heart

116 You have killed a great many in this city and you have filled
the streets thereof with the slain

117 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Your slain whom you have laid
in the midst thereof they are the flesh all this is the caldron and
I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof

118 You have feared the sword and I will bring the sword upon you
saith the Lord God

119 And I will cast you out of the midst thereof and I will deliver
you into the hand of the enemies and I will execute judgments upon
you

1110 You shall fall by the sword I will judge you in the borders of
Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord

In the borders of Israel  They pretended that they should die in
peace in Jerusalem God tells them it should not be so but that they
should be judged and condemned and fall by the sword in the borders of
Israel viz in Reblatha in the land of Emath where all their chief
men were put to death by Nabuchodonosor 4 Kings 25 and Jer 5210
27

1111 This shall not be as a caldron to you and you shall not be as
flesh in the midst thereof I will judge you in the borders of Israel

1112 And you shall know that I am the Lord because you have not
walked in my commandments and have not done my judgments but you have
done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about
you

1113 And it came to pass when I prophesied that Pheltias the son of
Banaias died and I fell down upon my face and I cried with a loud
voice and said Alas alas alas O Lord God wilt thou make an end
of all the remnant of Israel

1114 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

1115 Son of man thy brethren thy brethren thy kinsmen and all the
house of Israel all they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have
said Get ye far from the Lord the land is given in possession to us

Thy brethren etc  He speaks of them that had been carried away
captives before who were despised by them that remained in Jerusalem
but as the prophet here declares to them from God should be in a more
happy condition than they and after some time return from their
captivity

1116 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because I have removed them
far off among the Gentiles and because I have scattered them among the
countries I will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries
whither they are come

1117 Therefore speak to them Thus saith the Lord God I will gather
you from among the peoples and assemble you out of the countries
wherein you are scattered and I will give you the land of Israel

1118 And they shall go in thither and shall take away all the
scandals and all the abominations thereof from thence

1119 And I will give them one heart and will put a new spirit in
their bowels and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh
and will give them a heart of flesh

1120 That they may walk in my commandments and keep my judgments
and do them and that they may be my people and I may be their God

1121 But as for them whose heart walketh after their scandals and
abominations I will lay their way upon their head saith the Lord God

1122 And the cherubims lifted up their wings and the wheels with
them and the glory of the God of Israel was over them

1123 And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city
and stood over the mount that is on the east side of the city

1124 And the spirit lifted me up and brought me into Chaldea to
them of the captivity in vision by the spirit of God and the vision
which I had seen was taken up from me

1125 And I spoke to them of the captivity all the words of the Lord
which he had shewn me



Ezechiel Chapter 12


The prophet forsheweth by signs the captivity of Sedecias and the
desolation of the people all which shall quickly come to pass

121 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

122 Son of man thou dwellest in the midst of a provoking house who
have eyes to see and see not and ears to hear and hear not for they
are a provoking house

123 Thou therefore O son of man prepare thee all necessaries for
removing and remove by day into their sight and thou shalt remove out
of thy place to another place in their sight if so be they will regard
it for they are a provoking house

124 And thou shalt bring forth thy furniture as the furniture of one
that is removing by day in their sight and thou shalt go forth in the
evening in their presence as one goeth forth that removeth his
dwelling

125 Dig thee a way through the wall before their eyes and thou shalt
go forth through it

126 In their sight thou shalt be carried out upon mens shoulders
thou shalt be carried out in the dark thou shalt cover thy face and
shalt not see the ground for I have set thee for a sign of things to
come to the house of Israel

127 I did therefore as he had commanded me I brought forth my goods
by day as the goods of one that removeth and in the evening I digged
through the wall with my hand and I went forth in the dark and was
carried on mens shoulders in their sight

128 And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning saying

129 Son of man hath not the house of Israel the provoking house
said to thee What art thou doing

1210 Say to them Thus saith the Lord God This burden concerneth my
prince that is in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel that are
among them

1211 Say I am a sign of things to come to you as I have done so
shall it be done to them they shall be removed from their dwellings
and go into captivity

1212 And the prince that is in the midst of them shall be carried on
shoulders he shall go forth in the dark they shall dig through the
wall to bring him out his face shall be covered that he may not see
the ground with his eyes

1213 And I will spread my net over him and he shall be taken in my
net and I will bring him into Babylon into the land of the Chaldeans
and he shall not see it and there he shall die

He shall not see it  Because his eyes shall be put out by
Nabuchodonosor

1214 And all that are about him his guards and his troops I will
scatter into every wind and I will draw out the sword after them

1215 And they shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have
dispersed them among the nations and scattered them in the countries

1216 And I will leave a few men of them from the sword and from the
famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their wicked
deeds among the nations whither they shall go and they shall know that
I am the Lord

1217 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

1218 Son of man eat thy bread in trouble and drink thy water in
hurry and sorrow

1219 And say to the people of the land Thus saith the Lord God to
them that dwell in Jerusalem in the land of Israel They shall eat
their bread in care and drink their water in desolation that the land
may become desolate from the multitude that is therein for the
iniquity of all that dwell therein

1220 And the cities that are now inhabited shall be laid waste and
the land shall be desolate and you shall know that I am the Lord

1221 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

1222 Son of man what is this proverb that you have in the land of
Israel saying The days shall be prolonged and every vision shall
fail

1223 Say to them therefore Thus saith the Lord God I will make this
proverb to cease neither shall it be any more a common saying in
Israel and tell them that the days are at hand and the effect of
every vision

1224 For there shall be no more any vain visions nor doubtful
divination in the midst of the children of Israel

1225 For I the Lord will speak and what word soever I shall speak
it shall come to pass and shall not be prolonged any more but in your
days ye provoking house I will speak the word and will do it saith
the Lord God

1226 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

1227 Son of man behold the house of Israel they that say The
visions that this man seeth is for many days to come and this man
prophesieth of times afar off

1228 Therefore say to them Thus saith the Lord God not one word of
mine shall be prolonged any more the word that I shall speak shall be
accomplished saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 13


God declares against false prophets and prophetesses that deceive the
people with lies

131 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

132 Son of man prophesy thou against the prophets of Israel that
prophesy and thou shalt say to them that prophesy out of their own
heart Hear ye the word of the Lord

133 Thus saith the Lord God Woe to the foolish prophets that follow
their own spirit and see nothing

134 Thy prophets O Israel were like foxes in the deserts

135 You have not gone up to face the enemy nor have you set up a
wall for the house of Israel to stand in battle in the day of the
Lord

136 They see vain things and they foretell lies saying The Lord
saith whereas the Lord hath not sent them and they have persisted to
confirm what they have said

137 Have you not seen a vain vision and spoken a lying divination
and you say The Lord saith whereas I have not spoken

138 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because you have spoken vain
things and have seen lies therefore behold I come against you saith
the Lord God

139 And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vain things and
that divine lies they shall not be in the council of my people nor
shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel neither
shall they enter into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am
the Lord God

1310 Because they have deceived my people saying Peace and there
is no peace and the people built up a wall and they daubed it with
dirt without straw

1311 Say to them that daub without tempering that it shall fall for
there shall be an overflowing shower and I will cause great hailstones
to fall violently from above and a stormy wind to throw it down

1312 Behold when the wall is fallen shall it not be said to you
Where is the daubing wherewith you have daubed it

1313 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Lo I will cause a stormy
wind to break forth in my indignation and there shall be an
overflowing shower in my anger and great hailstones in my wrath to
consume

1314 And I will break down the wall that you have daubed with
untempered mortar and I will make it even with the ground and the
foundation thereof shall be laid bare and it shall fall and shall be
consumed in the midst thereof and you shall know that I am the Lord

1315 And I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that
daub it without tempering the mortar and I will say to you The wall
is no more and they that daub it are no more

1316 Even the prophets of Israel that prophesy to Jerusalem and that
see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the Lord
God

1317 And thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy
people that prophesy out of their own heart and do thou prophesy
against them

1318 And say Thus saith the Lord God Woe to them that sew cushions
under every elbow and make pillows for the heads of persons of every
age to catch souls and when they caught the souls of my people they
gave life to their souls

Sew cushions etc  Viz by making people easy in their sins and
promising them impunityIbid They gave life to their souls  That
is they flattered them with promises of life peace and security

1319 And they violated me among my people for a handful of barley
and a piece of bread to kill souls which should not die and to save
souls alive which should not live telling lies to my people that
believe lies

Violated me  That is dishonoured and discredited me Ibid To kill
souls etc  That is to sentence souls to death which are not to
die and to promise life to them who are not to live

1320 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold I declare against your
cushions wherewith you catch flying souls and I will tear them off
from your arms and I will let go the soul that you catch the souls
that should fly

1321 And I will tear your pillows and will deliver my people out of
your hand neither shall they be any more in your hands to be a prey
and you shall know that I am the Lord

1322 Because with lies you have made the heart of the just to mourn
whom I have not made sorrowful and have strengthened the hands of the
wicked that he should not return from his evil way and live

1323 Therefore you shall not see vain things nor divine divinations
any more and I will deliver my people out of your hand and you shall
know that I am the Lord



Ezechiel Chapter 14


God suffers the wicked to be deceived in punishment of their
wickedness The evils that shall come upon them for their sins for
which they shall not be delivered by the prayers of Noe Daniel and
Job But a remnant shall be preserved

141 And some of the ancients of Israel came to me and sat before me

142 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

143 Son of man these men have placed their uncleannesses in their
hearts and have set up before their face the stumblingblock of their
iniquity and shall I answer when they inquire of me

Uncleanness  That is their filthy idols upon which they have set
their hearts and which are a stumblingblock to their souls

144 Therefore speak to them and say to them Thus saith the Lord
God Man man of the house of Israel that shall place his uncleannesses
in his heart and set up the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his
face and shall come to the prophet inquiring of me by him I the Lord
will answer him according to the multitude of his uncleannesses

Man man  That is every man an Hebrew expression

145 That the house of Israel may be caught in their own heart with
which they have departed from me through all their idols

146 Therefore say to the house of Israel Thus saith the Lord God Be
converted and depart from your idols and turn away your faces from
all your abominations

147 For every man of the house of Israel and every stranger among
the proselytes in Israel if he separate himself from me and place his
idols in his heart and set the stumblingblock of his iniquity before
his face and come to the prophet to inquire of me by him I the Lord
will answer him by myself

148 And I will set my face against that man and will make him an
example and a proverb and will cut him off from the midst of my
people and you shall know that I am the Lord

149 And when the prophet shall err and speak a word I the Lord have
deceived that prophet and I will stretch forth my hand upon him and
will cut him off from the midst of my people Israel

The prophet shall err etc  He speaks of false prophets answering
out of their own heads and according to their own corrupt
inclinationsIbid I have deceived that prophet  God Almighty
deceives false prophets partly by withdrawing his light from them and
abandoning them to their own corrupt inclinations which push them on
to prophesy such things as are agreeable to those who consult them and
partly by disappointing them and causing all thing to happen contrary
to what they have said

1410 And they shall bear their iniquity according to the iniquity of
him that inquireth so shall the iniquity of the prophet be

1411 That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me nor be
polluted with all their transgressions but may be my people and I may
be their God saith the Lord of hosts

1412 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

1413 Son of man when a land shall sin against me so as to
transgress grievously I will stretch forth my hand upon it and will
break the staff of the bread thereof and I will send famine upon it
and will destroy man and beast out of it

1414 And if these three men Noe Daniel and Job shall be in it
they shall deliver their own souls by their justice saith the Lord of
hosts

1415 And if I shall bring mischievous beasts also upon the land to
waste it and it be desolate so that there is none that can pass
because of the beasts

1416 If these three men shall be in it as I live saith the Lord
they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be
delivered and the land shall be made desolate

1417 Or if I bring the sword upon that land and say to the sword
Pass through the land and I destroy man and beast out of it

1418 And these three men be in the midst thereof as I live saith
the Lord God they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they
themselves alone shall be delivered

1419 Or if I also send the pestilence upon that land and pour out my
indignation upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast

1420 And Noe and Daniel and Job be in the midst thereof as I live
saith the Lord God they shall deliver neither son nor daughter but
they shall only deliver their own souls by their justice

1421 For thus saith the Lord Although I shall send in upon Jerusalem
my four grievous judgments the sword and the famine and the
mischievous beasts and the pestilence to destroy out of it man and
beast

1422 Yet there shall be left in it some that shall be saved who
shall bring away their sons and daughters behold they shall come among
you and you shall see their way and their doings and you shall be
comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem in
all things that I have brought upon it

1423 And they shall comfort you when you shall see their ways and
their doings and you shall know that I have not done without cause all
that I have done in it saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 15


As a vine cut down is fit for nothing but the fire so it shall be with
Jerusalem for her sins

151 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

152 Son of man what shall be made of the wood of the vine out of
all the trees of the woods that are among the trees of the forests

153 Shall wood be taken of it to do any work or shall a pin be made
of it for any vessel to hang thereon

154 Behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire hath consumed
both ends thereof and the midst thereof is reduced to ashes shall it
be useful for any work

155 Even when it was whole it was not fit for work how much less
when the fire hath devoured and consumed it shall any work be made of
it

156 Therefore thus saith the Lord God As the vine tree among the
trees of the forests which I have given to the fire to be consumed so
will I deliver up the inhabitants of Jerusalem

157 And I will set my face against them they shall go out from fire
and fire shall consume them and you shall know that I am the Lord
when I shall have set my face against them

158 And I shall have made their land a wilderness and desolate
because they have been transgressors saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 16


Under the figure of an unfaithful wife God upbraids Jerusalem with her
ingratitude and manifold disloyalties but promiseth mercy by a new
covenant

161 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

162 Son of man make known to Jerusalem her abominations

Make known to Jerusalem  That is by letters for the prophet was
then in Babylon

163 And thou shalt say Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem Thy
root and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan thy father was an
Amorrhite and thy mother a Cethite

164 And when thou wast born in the day of thy nativity thy navel was
not cut neither wast thou washed with water for thy health nor salted
with salt nor swaddled with clouts

165 No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee out
of compassion to thee but thou wast cast out upon the face of the
earth in the abjection of thy soul in the day that thou wast born

166 And passing by thee I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in
thy own blood and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood Live I
have said to thee Live in thy blood

167 I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thou didst
increase and grow great and advancedst and camest to womans
ornament thy breasts were fashioned and thy hair grew and thou was
naked and full of confusion

168 And I passed by thee and saw thee and behold thy time was the
time of lovers and I spread my garment over thee and covered thy
ignominy and I swore to thee and I entered into a covenant with thee
saith the Lord God and thou becamest mine

169 And I washed thee with water and cleansed away thy blood from
thee and I anointed thee with oil

1610 And I clothed thee with embroidery and shod thee with violet
coloured shoes and I girded thee about with fine linen and clothed
thee with fine garments

1611 I decked thee also with ornaments and put bracelets on thy
hands and a chain about thy neck

I decked thee also with ornaments etc  That is with spiritual
benefits giving you a law with sacrifices sacraments and other holy
rites

1612 And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears
and a beautiful crown upon thy head

1613 And thou wast adorned with gold and silver and wast clothed
with fine linen and embroidered work and many colours thou didst eat
fine flour and honey and oil and wast made exceeding beautiful and
wast advanced to be a queen

1614 And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty for
thou wast perfect through my beauty which I had put upon thee saith
the Lord God

1615 But trusting in thy beauty thou playedst the harlot because of
thy renown and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger to be
his

1616 And taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sewed
together on each side and hast played the harlot upon them as hath
not been done before nor shall be hereafter

1617 And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels of my gold and my
silver which I gave thee and thou madest thee images of men and hast
committed fornication with them

1618 And thou tookest thy garments of divers colours and coveredst
them and settest my oil and my sweet incense before them

1619 And my bread which I gave thee the fine flour and oil and
honey wherewith I fed thee thou hast set before them for a sweet
odour and it was done saith the Lord God

1620 And thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast
borne to me and hast sacrificed the same to them to be devoured Is
thy fornication small

1621 Thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them consecrating
them by fire

Thou hast sacrificed etc  As there is nothing more base and
abominable than the crimes mentioned throughout this chapter so the
infidelities of the Israelites in forsaking God and sacrificing even
their children to idols are strongly figured by these allegories

1622 And after all thy abominations and fornications thou hast not
remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and full of
confusion trodden under foot in thy own blood

1623 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe to thee
saith the Lord God

1624 That thou didst also build thee a common stew and madest thee a
brothel house in every street

1625 At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy
prostitution and hast made thy beauty to be abominable and hast
prostituted thyself to every one that passed by and hast multiplied
thy fornications

1626 And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
neighbours men of large bodies and hast multiplied thy fornications
to provoke me

1627 Behold I will stretch out my hand upon thee and will take away
thy justification and I will deliver thee up to the will of the
daughters of the Philistines that hate thee that are ashamed of thy
wicked way

1628 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians because
thou wast not yet satisfied and after thou hadst played the harlot
with them even so thou wast not contented

1629 Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of
Chanaan with the Chaldeans and neither so wast thou satisfied

1630 Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart saith Lord God seeing thou
dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute

1631 Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every
way and thou hast made thy high place in every street and wast not as
a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price

1632 But is an adulteress that bringeth in strangers over her
husband

1633 Gifts are given to all harlots but thou hast given hire to all
thy lovers and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every
side to commit fornication with thee

1634 And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in
thy fornications and after thee there shall be no such fornication
for in that thou gavest rewards and didst not take rewards the
contrary hath been done in thee

1635 Therefore O harlot hear the word of the Lord

1636 Thus saith the Lord God Because thy money hath been poured out
and thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers and
with the idols of thy abominations by the blood of thy children whom
thou gavest them

1637 Behold I will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou
hast taken pleasure and all whom thou hast loved with all whom thou
hast hated and I will gather them together against thee on every side
and will discover thy shame in their sight and they shall see all thy
nakedness

1638 And I will judge thee as adulteresses and they that shed blood
are judged and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy

1639 And I will deliver thee into their hands and they shall destroy
thy brothel house and throw down thy stews and they shall strip thee
of thy garments and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty and
leave thee naked and full of disgrace

1640 And they shall bring upon thee a multitude and they shall stone
thee with stones and shall slay thee with their swords

1641 And they shall burn thy houses with fire and shall execute
judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and thou shalt cease
from fornication and shalt give no hire any more

1642 And my indignation shall rest in thee and my jealousy shall
depart from thee and I will cease and be angry no more

1643 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast
provoked me in all these things wherefore I also have turned all thy
ways upon thy head saith the Lord God and I have not done according
to thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations

1644 Behold every one that useth a common proverb shall use this
against thee saying As the mother was so also is her daughter

1645 Thou art thy mothers daughter that cast off her husband and
her children and thou art the sister of thy sisters who cast off
their husbands and their children your mother was a Cethite and your
father an Amorrhite

1646 And thy elder sister is Samaria she and her daughters that
dwell at thy left hand and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy
right hand is Sodom and her daughters

1647 But neither hast thou walked in their ways nor hast thou done a
little less than they according to their wickednesses thou hast done
almost more wicked things than they in all thy ways

1648 As I live saith the Lord God thy sister Sodom herself and her
daughters have not done as thou hast done and thy daughters

1649 Behold this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister pride fulness
of bread and abundance and the idleness of her and of her daughters
and they did not put forth their hand to the needy and the poor

This was the iniquity of Sodom etc  That is these were the steps by
which the Sodomites came to fall into those abominations for which they
were destroyed For pride gluttony and idleness are the highroad to
all kinds of lust especially when they are accompanied with a neglect
of the works of mercy

1650 And they were lifted up and committed abominations before me
and I took them away as thou hast seen

1651 And Samaria committed not half thy sins but thou hast surpassed
them with thy crimes and hast justified thy sisters by all thy
abominations which thou hast done

1652 Therefore do thou also bear thy confusion thou that hast
surpassed thy sisters with thy sins doing more wickedly than they for
they are justified above thee therefore be thou also confounded and
bear thy shame thou that hast justified thy sisters

1653 And I will bring back and restore them by bringing back Sodom
with her daughters and by bringing back Samaria and her daughters
and I will bring those that return of thee in the midst of them

I will bring back etc  This relates to the conversion of the
Gentiles out of all nations and of many of the Jews to the church of
Christ

1654 That thou mayest bear thy shame and mayest be confounded in all
that thou hast done comforting them

1655 And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall return to their
ancient state and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their
ancient state and thou and thy daughters shall return to your ancient
state

Ancient state  That is to their former state of liberty and their
ancient possessions In the spiritual sense to the true liberty and
the happy inheritance of the children of God through faith in Christ

1656 And Sodom thy sister was not heard of in thy mouth in the day
of thy pride

1657 Before thy malice was laid open as it is at this time making
thee a reproach of the daughters of Syria and of all the daughters of
Palestine round about thee that encompass thee on all sides

1658 Thou hast borne thy wickedness and thy disgrace saith the Lord
God

1659 For thus saith the Lord God I will deal with thee as thou hast
despised the oath in breaking the covenant

1660 And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy
youth and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant

1661 And thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou
shalt receive thy sisters thy elder and thy younger and I will give
them to thee for daughters but not by thy covenant

1662 And I will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know
that I am the Lord

1663 That thou mayest remember and be confounded and mayest no more
open thy mouth because of thy confusion when I shall be pacified
toward thee for all that thou hast done saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 17


The parable of the two eagles and the vine A promise of the cedar of
Christ and his church

171 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

172 Son of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable to the house
of Israel

173 And say Thus saith the Lord God A large eagle with great wings
longlimbed full of feathers and of variety came to Libanus and
took away the marrow of the cedar

A large eagle  Nabuchodonosor king of BabylonIbid Came to
Libanus  That is to JerusalemIbid Took away the marrow of the
cedar  King Jechonias

174 He cropped off the top of the twigs thereof and carried it away
into the land of Chanaan and he set it in a city of merchants

Chanaan  This name which signifies traffic is not taken here for
Palestine but for Chaldea and the city of merchants here mentioned is
Babylon

175 And he took of the seed of the land and put it in the ground for
seed that it might take a firm root over many waters he planted it on
the surface of the earth

Of the seed of the land etc  Viz Sedecias whom he made king

176 And it sprung up and grew into a spreading vine of low stature
and the branches thereof looked towards him and the roots thereof were
under him So it became a vine and grew into branches and shot forth
sprigs

Towards him  Nabuchodonosor to whom Sedecias swore allegiance

177 And there was another large eagle with great wings and many
feathers and behold this vine bending as it were her roots towards
him stretched forth her branches to him that he might water it by the
furrows of her plantation

Another large eagle  Viz the king of Egypt

178 It was planted in a good ground upon many waters that it might
bring forth branches and bear fruit that it might become a large
vine

179 Say thou Thus saith the Lord God Shall it prosper then shall
he not pull up the roots thereof and strip off its fruit and dry up
all the branches it hath shot forth and make it wither and this
without a strong arm or many people to pluck it up by the root

1710 Behold it is planted shall it prosper then shall it not be
dried up when the burning wind shall touch it and shall it not wither
in the furrows where it grew

1711 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

1712 Say to the provoking house Know you not what these things mean
Tell them Behold the king of Babylon cometh to Jerusalem and he shall
take away the king and the princes thereof and carry them with him to
Babylon

Shall take away  Or hath taken away etc for all this was now
done

1713 And he shall take one of the kings seed and make a covenant
with him and take an oath of him Yea and he shall take away the
mighty men of the land

1714 That it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up but keep
his covenant and observe it

1715 But he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to Egypt
that it might give him horses and much people And shall he that hath
done thus prosper or be saved and shall he escape that hath broken
the covenant

1716 As I live saith the Lord God In the place where the king
dwelleth that made him king whose oath he hath made void and whose
covenant he broke even in the midst of Babylon shall he die

1717 And not with a great army nor with much people shall Pharao
fight against him when he shall cast up mounts and build forts to
cut off many souls

1718 For he had despised the oath breaking his covenant and behold
he hath given his hand and having done all these things he shall not
escape

1719 Therefore thus saith the Lord God As I live I will lay upon
his head the oath he hath despised and the covenant he hath broken

1720 And I will spread my net over him and he shall be taken in my
net and I will bring him into Babylon and will judge him there for
the transgression by which he hath despised me

1721 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
sword and the residue shall be scattered into every wind and you
shall know that I the Lord have spoken

1722 Thus saith the Lord God I myself will take of the marrow of the
high cedar and will set it I will crop off a tender twig from the top
of the branches thereof and I will plant it on a mountain high and
eminent

Of the marrow of the high cedar etc  Of the royal stock of
DavidIbid A tender twig  Viz Jesus Christ whom God hath
planted in mount Sion that is the high mountain of his church to
which all nations flow

1723 On the high mountains of Israel will I plant it and it shall
shoot forth into branches and shall bear fruit and it shall become a
great cedar and all birds shall dwell under it and every fowl shall
make its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof

1724 And all the trees of the country shall know that I the Lord have
brought down the high tree and exalted the low tree and have dried up
the green tree and have caused the dry tree to flourish I the Lord
have spoken and have done it



Ezechiel Chapter 18


One man shall not bear the sins of another but every one his own if a
wicked man truly repent he shall be saved and if a just man leave his
justice he shall perish

181 And the word of the Lord came to me saying What is the meaning

182 That you use among you this parable as a proverb in the land of
Israel saying The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the teeth of
the children are set on edge

183 As I live saith the Lord God this parable shall be no more to
you a proverb in Israel

184 Behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the
soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth the same shall die

185 And if a man be just and do judgment and justice

186 And hath not eaten upon the mountains nor lifted up his eyes to
the idols of the house of Israel and hath not defiled his neighbours
wife nor come near to a menstruous woman

Not eaten upon the mountains  That is of the sacrifices there
offered to idols

187 And hath not wronged any man but hath restored the pledge to the
debtor hath taken nothing away by violence hath given his bread to
the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment

188 Hath not lent upon usury nor taken any increase hath withdrawn
his hand from iniquity and hath executed true judgment between man and
man

189 Hath walked in my commandments and kept my judgments to do
truth he is just he shall surely live saith the Lord God

To do truth  That is to act according to truth for the Hebrews
called everything that was just truth

1810 And if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and
that hath done some one of these things

1811 Though he doth not all these things but that eateth upon the
mountains and that defileth his neighbours wife

1812 That grieveth the needy and the poor that taketh away by
violence that restoreth not the pledge and that lifteth up his eyes
to idols that comitteth abomination

1813 That giveth upon usury and that taketh an increase shall such
a one live he shall not live Seeing he hath done all these detestable
things he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him

1814 But if he beget a son who seeing all his fathers sins which
he hath done is afraid and shall not do the like to them

1815 That hath not eaten upon the mountains nor lifted up his eyes
to the idols of the house of Israel and hath not defiled his
neighbours wife

1816 And hath not grieved any man nor withholden the pledge nor
taken away with violence but hath given his bread to the hungry and
covered the naked with a garment

1817 That hath turned away his hand from injuring the poor hath not
taken usury and increase but hath executed my judgments and hath
walked in my commandments this man shall not die for the iniquity of
his father but living he shall live

1818 As for his father because he oppressed and offered violence to
his brother and wrought evil in the midst of his people behold he is
dead in his own iniquity

1819 And you say Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his
father Verily because the son hath wrought judgment and justice hath
kept all my commandments and done them living he shall live

1820 The soul that sinneth the same shall die the son shall not
bear the iniquity of the father and the father shall not bear the
iniquity of the son the justice of the just shall be upon him and the
wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him

1821 But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath
committed and keep all my commandments and do judgment and justice
living he shall live and shall not die

1822 I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done in his
justice which he hath wrought he shall live

1823 Is it my will that a sinner should die saith the Lord God and
not that he should be converted from his ways and live

1824 But if the just man turn himself away from his justice and do
iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth
to work shall he live all his justices which he hath done shall not
be remembered in the prevarication by which he hath prevaricated and
in his sin which he hath committed in them he shall die

1825 And you have said The way of the Lord is not right Hear ye
therefore O house of Israel Is it my way that is not right and are
not rather your ways perverse

1826 For when the just turneth himself away from his justice and
comitteth iniquity he shall die therein in the injustice that he hath
wrought he shall die

1827 And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness
which he hath wrought and doeth judgment and justice he shall save
his soul alive

1828 Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his
iniquities which he hath wrought he shall surely live and not die

1829 And the children of Israel say The way of the Lord is not
right Are not my ways right O house of Israel and are not rather
your ways perverse

1830 Therefore will I judge every man according to his ways O house
of Israel saith the Lord God Be converted and do penance for all
your iniquities and iniquity shall not be your ruin

1831 Cast away from you all your transgressions by which you have
transgressed and make to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit and
why will you die O house of Israel

1832 For I desire not the death of him that dieth saith the Lord
God return ye and live



Ezechiel Chapter 19


The parable of the young lions and of the vineyard that is wasted

191 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel

192 And say Why did thy mother the lioness lie down among the lions
and bring up her whelps in the midst of young lions

Thy mother the lioness  Jerusalem

193 And she brought out one of her whelps and he became a lion and
he learned to catch the prey and to devour men

One of her whelps  Viz Joachaz alias Sellum

194 And the nations heard of him and took him but not without
receiving wounds and they brought him in chains into the land of
Egypt

195 But she seeing herself weakened and that her hope was lost took
one of her young lions and set him up for a lion

One of her young lions  Joakim

196 And he went up and down among the lions and became a lion and
he learned to catch the prey and to devour men

197 He learned to make widows and to lay waste their cities and the
land became desolate and the fulness thereof by the noise of his
roaring

198 And the nations came together against him on every side out of
the provinces and they spread their net over him in their wounds he
was taken

199 And they put him into a cage they brought him in chains to the
king of Babylon and they cast him into prison that his voice should
no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel

1910 Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the water her
fruit and her branches have grown out of many waters

1911 And she hath strong rods to make sceptres for them that bear
rule and her stature was exalted among the branches and she saw her
height in the multitude of her branches

1912 But she was plucked up in wrath and cast on the ground and the
burning wind dried up her fruit her strong rods are withered and
dried up the fire hath devoured her

1913 And now she is transplanted into the desert in a land not
passable and dry

1914 And a fire is gone out from a rod of her branches which hath
devoured her fruit so that she now hath no strong rod to be a sceptre
of rulers This is a lamentation and it shall be for a lamentation



Ezechiel Chapter 20


God refuses to answer the ancients of Israel inquiring by the prophet
but by him setteth his benefits before their eyes and their heinous
sins threatening yet greater punishments but still mixed with mercy

201 And it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the
tenth day of the month there came men of the ancients of Israel to
inquire of the Lord and they sat before me

202 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

203 Son of man speak to the ancients of Israel and say to them Thus
saith the Lord God Are you come to inquire of me As I live I will
not answer you saith the Lord God

204 If thou judgest them if thou judgest O son of man declare to
them the abominations of their fathers

If thou judgest them  Or if thou wilt enter into the cause and plead
against them

205 And say to them Thus saith the Lord God In the day when I chose
Israel and lifted up my hand for the race of the house of Jacob and
appeared to them in the land of Egypt and lifted up my hand for them
saying I am the Lord your God

206 In that day I lifted up my hand for them to bring them out of the
land of Egypt into a land which I had provided for them flowing with
milk and honey which excelled amongst all lands

207 And I said to them Let every man cast away the scandals of his
eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt I am the Lord
your God

Scandals etc  Offensiones That is the abominations or idols to
the worship of which they were allured by their eyes

208 But they provoked me and would not hearken to me they did not
every man cast away the abominations of his eyes neither did they
forsake the idols of Egypt and I said I would pour out my indignation
upon them and accomplish my wrath against them in the midst of the
land of Egypt

209 But I did otherwise for my names sake that it might not be
violated before the nations in the midst of whom they were and among
whom I made myself known to them to bring them out of the land of
Egypt

2010 Therefore I brought them out from the land of Egypt and brought
them into the desert

2011 And I gave them my statutes and I shewed them my judgments
which if a man do he shall live in them

2012 Moreover I gave them also my sabbaths to be a sign between me
and them and that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify
them

2013 But the house of Israel provoked me in the desert they walked
not in my statutes and they cast away my judgments which if a man do
he shall live in them and they grievously violated my sabbaths I said
therefore that I would pour out my indignation upon them in the desert
and would consume them

2014 But I spared them for the sake of my name lest it should be
profaned before the nations from which I brought them out in their
sight

2015 So I lifted up my hand over them in the desert not to bring
them into the land which I had given them flowing with milk and honey
the best of all lands

2016 Because they cast off my judgments and walked not in my
statutes and violated my sabbaths for their heart went after idols

2017 Yet my eye spared them so that I destroyed them not neither
did I consume them in the desert

2018 And I said to their children in the wilderness Walk not in the
statutes of your fathers and observe not their judgments nor be ye
defiled with their idols

2019 I am the Lord your God walk ye in my statutes and observe my
judgments and do them

2020 And sanctify my sabbaths that they may be a sign between me and
you and that you may know that I am the Lord your God

2021 But their children provoked me they walked not in my
commandments nor observed my judgments to do them which if a man do
he shall live in them and they violated my sabbaths and I threatened
to pour out my indignation upon them and to accomplish my wrath in
them in the desert

2022 But I turned away my hand and wrought for my names sake that
it might not be violated before the nations out of which I brought
them forth in their sight

2023 Again I lifted up my hand upon them in the wilderness to
disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the
countries

2024 Because they had not done my judgments and had cast off my
statutes and had violated my sabbaths and their eyes had been after
the idols of their fathers

2025 Therefore I also gave them statutes that were not good and
judgments in which they shall not live

Statutes that were not good etc  Viz the laws and ordinances of
their enemies or those imposes upon them by that cruel tyrant the
devil to whose power they were delivered up for their sins

2026 And I polluted them in their own gifts when they offered all
that opened the womb for their offences and they shall know that I am
the Lord

I polluted them etc  That is I gave them up to such blindness in
punishment of their offences as to pollute themselves with the blood
of all their firstborn whom they offered up to their idols in
compliance with their wicked devices

2027 Wherefore speak to the house of Israel O son of man and say to
them Thus saith the Lord God Moreover in this also your fathers
blaspheme me when they had despised and contemned me

2028 And I had brought them into the land for which I lifted up my
hand to give it them they saw every high hill and every shady tree
and there they sacrificed their victims and there they presented the
provocation of their offerings and there they set their sweet odours
and poured forth their libations

2029 And I said to them What meaneth the high place to which you go
and the name thereof was called Highplace even to this day

2030 Wherefore say to the house of Israel Thus saith the Lord God
Verily you are defiled in the way of your fathers and you commit
fornication with their abominations

2031 And you defile yourselves with all your idols unto this day in
the offering of your gifts when you make your children pass through
the fire and shall I answer you O house of Israel As I live saith
the Lord God I will not answer you

2032 Neither shall the thought of your mind come to pass by which
you say We will be as the Gentiles and as the families of the earth
to worship stocks and stones

2033 As I live saith the Lord God I will reign over you with a
strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out

2034 And I will bring you out from the people and I will gather you
out of the countries in which you are scattered I will reign over you
with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured
out

2035 And I will bring you into the wilderness of people and there
will I plead with you face to face

The wilderness of people  That is a desert in which there are no
people

2036 As I pleaded against your fathers in the desert of the land of
Egypt even so will I judge you saith the Lord God

2037 And I will make you subject to my sceptre and will bring you
into the bands of the covenant

2038 And I will pick out from among you the transgressors and the
wicked and will bring them out of the land where they sojourn and
they shall not enter into the land of Israel and you shall know that I
am the Lord

2039 And as for you O house of Israel thus saith the Lord God Walk
ye every one after your idols and serve them But if in this also you
hear me not but defile my holy name any more with your gifts and with
your idols

Walk ye every one etc  It is not an allowance much less a
commandment to serve idols but a figure of speech by which God would
have them to understand that if they would walk after their idols they
must not pretend to serve him at the same time for that he would by no
means suffer such a mixture of worship

2040 In my holy mountain in the high mountain of Israel saith the
Lord God there shall all the house of Israel serve me all of them I
say in the land in which they shall please me and there will I
require your firstfruits and the chief of your tithes with all your
sanctifications

In my holy mountain etc  The foregoing verse to make the sense
complete must be understood so as to condemn and reject that mixture
of worship which the Jews then followed In this verse God promises to
the true Israelites especially to those of the Christian church that
they shall serve him in another manner in his holy mountain the
spiritual Sion and shall by accepted of by him

2041 I will accept of you for an odour of sweetness when I shall
have brought you out from the people and shall have gathered you out
of the lands into which you are scattered and I will be sanctified in
you in the sight of the nations

2042 And you shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have brought
you into the land of Israel into the land for which I lifted up my
hand to give it to your fathers

2043 And there you shall remember your ways and all your wicked
doings with which you have been defiled and you shall be displeased
with yourselves in your own sight for all your wicked deeds which you
committed

2044 And you shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have done
well by you for my own names sake and not according to your evil
ways nor according to your wicked deeds O house of Israel saith the
Lord God

2045 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

2046 Son of man set thy face against the way of the south and drop
towards the south and prophesy against the forest of the south field

Of the south  Jerusalem lay towards the south of Babylon where the
prophet then was and is here called the forest of the south field
and is threatened with utter desolation

2047 And say to the south forest Hear the word of the Lord Thus
saith the Lord God Behold I will kindle a fire in thee and will burn
in thee every green tree and every dry tree the flame of the fire
shall not be quenched and every face shall be burned in it from the
south even to the north

2048 And all flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it and it
shall not be quenched

2049 And I said Ah ah ah O Lord God they say of me Doth not
this man speak by parables



Ezechiel Chapter 21


The destruction of Jerusalem by the sword is further described the
ruin also of the Ammonites is forshewn And finally Babylon the
destroyer of others shall be destroyed

211 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

212 Son of man set thy face toward Jerusalem and let thy speech
flow towards the holy places and prophesy against the land of Israel

213 And say to the land of Israel Thus saith the Lord God Behold I
come against thee and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath
and will cut off in thee the just and the wicked

214 And forasmuch as I have cut off in thee the just and the wicked
therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh
from the south even to the north

215 That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out
of its sheath not to be turned back

216 And thou son of man mourn with the breaking of thy loins and
with bitterness sigh before them

217 And when they shall say to thee Why mournest thou thou shalt
say For that which I hear because it cometh and every heart shall
melt and all hands shall be made feeble and every spirit shall faint
and water shall run down every knee behold it cometh and it shall be
done saith the Lord God

218 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

219 Son of man prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord God Say The
sword the sword is sharpened and furbished

2110 It is sharpened to kill victims it is furbished that it may
glitter thou removest the sceptre of my son thou hast cut down every
tree

Thou removest the sceptre of my son  He speaks according to St
Jerome to the sword of Nabuchodonosor which was about to remove the
sceptre of Israel whom God here calls his son

2111 And I have given it to be furbished that it may be handled
this sword is sharpened and it is furbished that it may be in the
hand of the slayer

2112 Cry and howl O son of man for this sword is upon my people
it is upon all the princes of Israel that are fled they are delivered
up to the sword with my people strike therefore upon thy thigh

2113 Because it is tried and that when it shall overthrow the
sceptre and it shall not be saith the Lord God

2114 Thou therefore O son of man prophesy and strike thy hands
together and let the sword be doubled and let the sword of the slain
be tripled this is the sword of a great slaughter that maketh them
stand amazed

2115 And languish in heart and that multiplieth ruins In all their
gates I have set the dread of the sharp sword the sword that is
furbished to glitter that is made ready for slaughter

2116 Be thou sharpened go to the right hand or to the left which
way soever thou hast a mind to set thy face

2117 And I will clap my hands together and will satisfy my
indignation I the Lord have spoken

2118 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

2119 And thou son of man set thee two ways for the sword of the
king of Babylon to come both shall come forth out of one land and
with his hand he shall draw lots he shall consult at the head of the
way of the city

2120 Thou shalt make a way that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
children of Ammon and to Juda unto Jerusalem the strong city

2121 For the king of Babylon stood in the highway at the head of two
ways seeking divination shuffling arrows he inquired of the idols
and consulted entrails

2122 On his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem to set
battering rams to open the mouth in slaughter to lift up the voice in
howling to set engines against the gates to cast up a mount to build
forts

2123 And he shall be in their eyes as one consulting the oracle in
vain and imitating the leisure of sabbaths but he will call to
remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken

2124 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because you have remembered
your iniquity and have discovered your prevarications and your sins
have appeared in all your devices because I say You have remembered
you shall be taken with the hand

2125 But thou profane wicked prince of Israel whose day is come that
hath been appointed in the time of iniquity

Thou profane etc  He speaks to king Sedecias who had broken his
oath and was otherwise a wicked prince

2126 Thus saith the Lord God Remove the diadem take off the crown
is it not this that hath exalted the low one and brought down him that
was high

Is it not this that hath exalted the low one  The royal crown of Juda
had exalted Sedecias from a private state and condition to the
sovereign power as the loss of it had brought down Jechonias etc

2127 I will shew it to be iniquity iniquity iniquity but this was
not done till he came to whom judgment belongeth and I will give it
him

I will shew it to be iniquity etc  Or I will overturn it viz the
crown of Juda for the manifold iniquities of the kings but it shall
not be utterly removed till Christ come whose right it is and who
shall reign in the spiritual house of Jacob that is in his church
for evermore

2128 And thou son of man prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord God
concerning the children of Ammon and concerning their reproach and
thou shalt say O sword O sword come out of the scabbard to kill be
furbished to destroy and to glitter

Concerning their reproach  By which they had reproached and insulted
over the Jews at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem

2129 Whilst they see vain things in thy regard and they divine lies
to bring thee upon the necks of the wicked that are wounded whose
appointed day is come in the time of iniquity

2130 Return into thy sheath I will judge thee in the place wherein
thou wast created in the land of thy nativity

Return into thy sheath etc  The sword of Babylon after raging
against many nations was shortly to be judged and destroyed at home by
the Medes and Persians

2131 And I will pour out upon thee my indignation in the fire of my
rage will I blow upon thee and will give thee into the hands of men
that are brutish and contrive thy destruction

2132 Thou shalt be fuel for the fire thy blood shall be in the midst
of the land thou shalt be forgotten for I the Lord have spoken it



Ezechiel Chapter 22


The general corruption of the inhabitants of Jerusalem for which God
will consume them as dross in his furnace

221 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

222 And thou son of man dost thou not judge dost thou not judge the
city of blood

223 And thou shalt shew her all her abominations and shalt say Thus
saith the Lord God This is the city that sheddeth blood in the midst
of her that her time may come and that hath made idols against
herself to defile herself

224 Thou art become guilty in thy blood which thou hast shed and
thou art defiled in thy idols which thou hast made and thou hast made
thy days to draw near and hast brought on the time of thy years
therefore have I made thee a reproach to the Gentiles and a mockery to
all countries

225 Those that are near and those that are far from thee shall
triumph over thee thou filthy one infamous great in destruction

226 Behold the princes of Israel every one hath employed his arm in
thee to shed blood

227 They have abused father and mother in thee they have oppressed
the stranger in the midst of thee they have grieved the fatherless and
widow in thee

228 Thou hast despised my sanctuaries and profaned my sabbaths

229 Slanderers have been in thee to shed blood and they have eaten
upon the mountains in thee they have committed wickedness in the midst
of thee

2210 They have discovered the nakedness of their father in thee they
have humbled the uncleanness of the menstruous woman in thee

2211 And every one hath committed abomination with his neighbours
wife and the father in law hath wickedly defiled his daughter in law
the brother hath oppressed his sister the daughter of his father in
thee

2212 They have taken gifts in thee to shed blood thou hast taken
usury and increase and hast covetously oppressed thy neighbours and
thou hast forgotten me saith the Lord God

2213 Behold I have clapped my hands at thy covetousness which thou
hast exercised and at the blood that hath been shed in the midst of
thee

2214 Shall thy heart endure or shall thy hands prevail in the days
which I will bring upon thee I the Lord have spoken and will do it

2215 And I will disperse thee in the nations and will scatter thee
among the countries and I will put an end to thy uncleanness in thee

2216 And I will possess thee in the sight of the Gentiles and thou
shalt know that I am the Lord

2217 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

2218 Son of man the house of Israel is become dross to me all these
are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace
they are become the dross of silver

2219 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because you are all turned
into dross therefore behold I will gather you together in the midst of
Jerusalem

2220 As they gather silver and brass and tin and iron and lead in
the midst of the furnace that I may kindle a fire in it to melt it so
will I gather you together in my fury and in my wrath and will take my
rest and I will melt you down

2221 And will gather you together and will burn you in the fire of
my wrath and you shall be melted in the midst thereof

2222 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall you be
in the midst thereof and you shall know that I am the Lord when I
have poured out my indignation upon you

2223 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

2224 Son of man say to her Thou art a land that is unclean and not
rained upon in the day of wrath

2225 There is a conspiracy of prophets in the midst thereof like a
lion that roareth and catcheth the prey they have devoured souls they
have taken riches and hire they have made many widows in the midst
thereof

2226 Her priests have despised my law and have defiled my
sanctuaries they have put no difference between holy and profane nor
have distinguished between the polluted and the clean and they have
turned away their eyes from my sabbaths and I was profaned in the
midst of them

2227 Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves ravening the
prey to shed blood and to destroy souls and to run after gains
through covetousness

2228 And her prophets have daubed them without tempering the mortar
seeing vain things and divining lies unto them saying Thus saith the
Lord God when the Lord hath not spoken

2229 The people of the land have used oppression and committed
robbery they afflicted the needy and poor and they oppressed the
stranger by calumny without judgment

2230 And I sought among them for a man that might set up a hedge and
stand in the gap before me in favour of the land that I might not
destroy it and I found none

2231 And I poured out my indignation upon them in the fire of my
wrath I consumed them I have rendered their way upon their own head
saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 23


Under the names of the two harlots Oolla and Ooliba are described the
manifold disloyalties of Samaria and Jerusalem with the punishment of
them both

231 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

232 Son of man there were two women daughters of one mother

233 And they committed fornication in Egypt in their youth they
committed fornication there were their breasts pressed down and the
teats of their virginity were bruised

Committed fornication  That is idolatry

234 And their names were Oolla the elder and Ooliba her younger
sister and I took them and they bore sons and daughters Now for
their names Samaria is Oolla and Jerusalem is Ooliba

Oolla and Ooliba  God calls the kingdom of Israel Oolla which
signifies their own habitation because they separated themselves from
his temple and the kingdom of Juda Ooliba which signifies his
habitation in her because of his temple among them in Jerusalem

235 And Oolla committed fornication against me and doted on her
lovers on the Assyrians that came to her

On the Assyraians etc  That is the idols of the Assyrians for all
that is said in this chapter of the fornications of Israel and Juda is
to be understood in a spiritual sense of their disloyalty to the Lord
by worshipping strange gods

236 Who were clothed with blue princes and rulers beautiful
youths all horsemen mounted upon horses

237 And she committed her fornications with those chosen men all
sons of the Assyrians and she defiled herself with the uncleanness of
all them on whom she doted

238 Moreover also she did not forsake her fornications which she had
committed in Egypt for they also lay with her in her youth and they
bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured out their fornication
upon her

239 Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers into
the hands of the sons of the Assyrians upon whose lust she doted

2310 They discovered her disgrace took away her sons and daughters
and slew her with the sword and they became infamous women and they
executed judgments in her

2311 And when her sister Ooliba saw this she was mad with lust more
than she and she carried her fornication beyond the fornication of her
sister

2312 Impudently prostituting herself to the children of the
Assyrians the princes and rulers that came to her clothed with
divers colours to the horsemen that rode upon horses and to young men
all of great beauty

2313 And I saw that she was defiled and that they both took one way

2314 And she increased her fornications and when she had seen men
painted on the wall the images of the Chaldeans set forth in colours

2315 And girded with girdles about their reins and with dyed turbans
on their heads the resemblance of all the captains the likeness of
the sons of Babylon and of the land of the Chaldeans wherein they were
born

2316 She doted upon them with the lust of her eyes and she sent
messengers to them into Chaldea

2317 And when the sons of Babylon were come to her to the bed of
love they defiled her with their fornications and she was polluted by
them and her soul was glutted with them

2318 And she discovered her fornications and discovered her
disgrace and my soul was alienated from her as my soul was alienated
from her sister

2319 For she multiplied her fornications remembering the days of her
youth in which she played the harlot in the land of Egypt

2320 And she was mad with lust after lying with them whose flesh is
as the flesh of asses and whose issue as the issue of horses

2321 And thou hast renewed the wickedness of thy youth when thy
breasts were pressed in Egypt and the paps of thy virginity broken

2322 Therefore Ooliba thus saith the Lord God Behold I will raise
up against thee all thy lovers with whom thy soul hath been glutted
and I will gather them together against thee round about

2323 The children of Babylon and all the Chaldeans the nobles and
the kings and princes all the sons of the Assyrians beautiful young
men all the captains and rulers the princes of princes and the
renowned horsemen

2324 And they shall come upon thee well appointed with chariot and
wheel a multitude of people they shall be armed against thee on every
side with breastplate and buckler and helmet and I will set judgment
before them and they shall judge thee by their judgments

2325 And I will set my jealousy against thee which they shall
execute upon thee with fury they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears
and what remains shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and
thy daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by fire

2326 And they shall strip thee of thy garments and take away the
instruments of thy glory

2327 And I will put an end to thy wickedness in thee and thy
fornication brought out of the land of Egypt neither shalt thou lift
up thy eyes to them nor remember Egypt any more

2328 For thus saith the Lord God Behold I will deliver thee into
the hands of them whom thou hatest into their hands with whom thy soul
hath been glutted

2329 And they shall deal with thee in hatred and they shall take
away all thy labours and shall let thee go naked and full of
disgrace and the disgrace of thy fornication shall be discovered thy
wickedness and thy fornications

2330 They have done these things to thee because thou hast played
the harlot with the nations among which thou wast defiled with their
idols

2331 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister and I will give her
cup into thy hand

2332 Thus saith the Lord God Thou shalt drink thy sisters cup deep
and wide thou shalt be had in derision and scorn which containeth
very much

2333 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup
of grief and sadness with the cup of thy sister Samaria

2334 And thou shalt drink it and shalt drink it up even to the
dregs and thou shalt devour the fragments thereof thou shalt rend thy
breasts because I have spoken it saith the Lord God

2335 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because thou hast forgotten
me and hast cast me off behind thy back bear thou also thy
wickedness and thy fornications

2336 And the Lord spoke to me saying Son of man dost thou judge
Oolla and Ooliba and dost thou declare to them their wicked deeds

2337 Because they have committed adultery and blood is in their
hands and they have committed fornication with their idols moreover
also their children whom they bore to me they have offered to them to
be devoured

2338 Yea and they have done this to me They polluted my sanctuary
on the same day and profaned my sabbaths

2339 And when they sacrificed their children to their idols and went
into my sanctuary the same day to profane it they did these things
even in the midst of my house

2340 They sent for men coming from afar to whom they had sent a
messenger and behold they came for whom thou didst wash thyself and
didst paint thy eyes and wast adorned with womens ornaments

2341 Thou sattest on a very fine bed and a table was decked before
thee whereupon thou didst set my incense and my ointment

2342 And there was in her the voice of a multitude rejoicing and to
some that were brought of the multitude of men and that came from the
desert they put bracelets on their hands and beautiful crowns on
their heads

2343 And I said to her that was worn out in her adulteries Now will
this woman still continue in her fornication

2344 And they went in to her as to a harlot so went they in unto
Oolla and Ooliba wicked women

2345 They therefore are just men these shall judge them as
adulteresses are judged and as shedders of blood are judged because
they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands

2346 For thus saith the Lord God Bring a multitude upon them and
deliver them over to tumult and rapine

2347 And let the people stone them with stone and let them be
stabbed with their swords they shall kill their sons and daughters
and their houses they shall burn with fire

2348 And I will take away wickedness out of the land and all women
shall learn not to do according to the wickedness of them

2349 And they shall render your wickedness upon you and you shall
bear the sins of your idols and you shall know that I am the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 24


Under the parable of a boiling pot is shewn the utter destruction of
Jerusalem for which the Jews at Babylon shall not dare to mourn

241 And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year in the
tenth month the tenth day of the month saying

242 Son of man write thee the name of this day on which the king of
Babylon hath set himself against Jerusalem to day

243 And thou shalt speak by a figure a parable to the provoking
house and say to them Thus saith the Lord God Set on a pot set it
on I say and put water in it

244 Heap together into it the pieces thereof every good piece the
thigh and the shoulder choice pieces and full of bones

245 Take the fattest of the flock and lay together piles of bones
under it the seething thereof is boiling hot and the bones thereof
are thoroughly sodden in the midst of it

246 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Woe to the bloody city to the
pot whose rust is in it and its rust is not gone out of it cast it
out piece by piece there hath no lot fallen upon it

247 For her blood is in the midst of her she hath shed it upon the
smooth rock she hath not shed it upon the ground that it might be
covered with dust

248 And that I might bring my indignation upon her and take my
vengeance I have shed her blood upon the smooth rock that it should
not be covered

249 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Woe to the bloody city of
which I will make a great bonfire

2410 Heap together the bones which I will burn with fire the flesh
shall be consumed and the whole composition shall be sodden and the
bones shall be consumed

2411 Then set it empty upon burning coals that it may be hot and
the brass thereof may be melted and let the filth of it be melted in
the midst thereof and let the rust of it be consumed

2412 Great pains have been taken and the great rust thereof is not
gone out not even by fire

2413 Thy uncleanness is execrable because I desired to cleanse thee
and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness neither shalt thou be
cleansed before I cause my indignation to rest in thee

2414 I the Lord have spoken it shall come to pass and I will do it
I will not pass by nor spare nor be pacified I will judge thee
according to thy ways and according to thy doings saith the Lord

2415 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

2416 Son of man behold I take from thee the desire of thy eyes with
a stroke and thou shall not lament nor weep neither shall thy tears
run down

2417 Sigh in silence make no mourning for the dead let the tire of
thy head be upon thee and thy shoes on thy feet and cover not thy
face nor eat the meat of mourners

2418 So I spoke to the people in the morning and my wife died in the
evening and I did in the morning as he had commanded me

2419 And the people said to me Why dost thou not tell us what these
things mean that thou doest

2420 And I said to them The word of the Lord came to me saying

2421 Speak to the house of Israel Thus saith the Lord God Behold I
will profane my sanctuary the glory of your realm and the thing that
your eyes desire and for which your soul feareth your sons and your
daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword

2422 And you shall do as I have done you shall not cover your faces
nor shall you eat the meat of mourners

2423 You shall have crowns on your heads and shoes on your feet you
shall not lament nor weep but you shall pine away for your iniquities
and every one shall sigh with his brother

2424 And Ezechiel shall be unto you for a sign of things to come
according to all that he hath done so shall you do when this shall
come to pass and you shall know that I am the Lord God

2425 And thou O son of man behold in the day wherein I will take
away from them their strength and the joy of their glory and the
desire of their eyes upon which their souls rest their sons and their
daughters

2426 In that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee to tell
thee

2427 In that day I say shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath
escaped and thou shalt speak and shalt be silent no more and thou
shalt be unto them for a sign of things to come and you shall know
that I am the Lord



Ezechiel Chapter 25


A prophecy against the Ammonites Moabites Edomites and Philistines
for their malice against the Israelites

251 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

252 Son of man set thy face against the children of Ammon and thou
shalt prophesy of them

253 And thou shalt say to the children of Ammon Hear ye the word of
the Lord God Thus saith the Lord God Because thou hast said Ha ha
upon my sanctuary because it was profaned and upon the land of
Israel because it was laid waste and upon the house of Juda because
they are led into captivity

254 Therefore will I deliver thee to the men of the east for an
inheritance and they shall place their sheepcotes in thee and shall
set up their tents in thee they shall eat thy fruits and they shall
drink thy milk

255 And I will make Rabbath a stable for camels and the children of
Ammon a couching place for flocks and you shall know that I am the
Lord

Rabbath  The capital city of the Ammonites it was afterwards called
Philadelphia

256 For thus saith the Lord God Because thou hast clapped thy hands
and stamped with thy foot and hast rejoiced with all thy heart against
the land of Israel

257 Therefore behold I will stretch forth my hand upon thee and will
deliver thee to be the spoil of nations and will cut thee off from
among the people and destroy thee out of the lands and break thee in
pieces and thou shalt know that I am the Lord

258 Thus saith the Lord God Because Moab and Seir have said Behold
the house of Juda is like all other nations

259 Therefore behold I will open the shoulder of Moab from the
cities from his cities I say and his borders the noble cities of
the land of Bethiesimoth and Beelmeon and Cariathaim

2510 To the people of the east with the children of Ammon and I will
give it them for an inheritance that there may be no more any
remembrance of the children of Ammon among the nations

2511 And I will execute judgments in Moab and they shall know that I
am the Lord

2512 Thus saith the Lord God Because Edom hath taken vengeance to
revenge herself of the children of Juda and hath greatly offended and
hath sought revenge of them

2513 Therefore thus saith the Lord God I will stretch forth my hand
upon Edom and will take away out of it man and beast and will make it
desolate from the south and they that are in Dedan shall fall by the
sword

2514 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
Israel and they shall do in Edom according to my wrath and my fury
and they shall know my vengeance saith the Lord God

2515 Thus saith the Lord God Because the Philistines have taken
vengeance and have revenged themselves with all their mind destroying
and satisfying old enmities

2516 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold I will stretch forth
my hand upon the Philistines and will kill the killers and will
destroy the remnant of the sea coast

2517 And I will execute great vengeance upon them rebuking them in
fury and they shall know that I am the Lord when I shall lay my
vengeance upon them



Ezechiel Chapter 26


A prophecy of the destruction of the famous city of Tyre by
Nabuchodonosor

261 And it came to pass in the eleventh year the first day of the
month that the word of the Lord came to me saying

262 Son of man because Tyre hath said of Jerusalem Aha the gates
of the people are broken she is turned to me I shall be filled now
she is laid waste

263 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold I come against thee O
Tyre and I will cause many nations to come up to thee as the waves of
the sea rise up

264 And they shall break down the walls of Tyre and destroy the
towers thereof and I will scrape her dust from her and make her like
a smooth rock

265 She shall be a drying place for nets in the midst of the sea
because I have spoken it saith the Lord God and she shall be a spoil
to the nations

266 Her daughters also that are in the field shall be slain by the
sword and they shall know that I am the Lord

267 For thus saith the Lord God Behold I will bring against Tyre
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon the king of kings from the north with
horses and chariots and horsemen and companies and much people

268 Thy daughters that are in the field he shall kill with the
sword and he shall compass thee with forts and shall cast up a mount
round about and he shall lift up the buckler against thee

269 And he shall set engines of war and battering rams against thy
walls and shall destroy thy towers with his arms

2610 By reason of the multitude of his horses their dust shall cover
thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and wheels
and chariots when they shall go in at thy gates as by the entrance of
a city that is destroyed

2611 With the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy
streets thy people he shall kill with the sword and thy famous
statues shall fall to the ground

2612 They shall waste thy riches they shall make a spoil of thy
merchandise and they shall destroy thy walls and pull down thy fine
houses and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in
the midst of the waters

2613 And I will make the multitude of thy songs to cease and the
sound of thy harps shall be heard no more

2614 And I will make thee like a naked rock thou shalt be a drying
place for nets neither shalt thou be built any more for I have spoken
it saith the Lord God

2615 Thus saith the Lord God to Tyre Shall not the islands shake at
the sound of thy fall and the groans of thy slain when they shall be
killed in the midst of thee

2616 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their
thrones and take off their robes and cast away their broidered
garments and be clothed with astonishment they shall sit on the
ground and with amazement shall wonder at thy sudden fall

2617 And taking up a lamentation over thee they shall say to thee
How art thou fallen that dwellest in the sea renowned city that wast
strong in the sea with thy inhabitants whom all did dread

2618 Now shall the ships be astonished in the day of thy terror and
the islands in the sea shall be troubled because no one cometh out of
thee

2619 For thus saith the Lord God When I shall make thee a desolate
city like the cities that are not inhabited and shall bring the deep
upon thee and many waters shall cover thee

2620 And when I shall bring thee down with those that descend into
the pit to the everlasting people and shall set thee in the lowest
parts of the earth as places desolate of old with them that are
brought down into the pit that thou be not inhabited and when I shall
give glory in the land of the living

2621 I will bring thee to nothing and thou shalt not be and if thou
be sought for thou shalt not be found any more for ever saith the
Lord God

Ezechiel Chapter 28


The king of Tyre who affected to be like to God shall fall under the
like sentence with Lucifer The judgment of Sidon The restoration of
Israel

281 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

282 Son of man say to the prince of Tyre Thus saith the Lord God
Because thy heart is lifted up and thou hast said I am God and I sit
in the chair of God in the heart of the sea whereas thou art a man
and not God and hast set thy heart as if it were the heart of God

283 Behold thou art wiser than Daniel no secret is hid from thee

Thou art wiser than Daniel  Viz in thy own conceit The wisdom of
Daniel was so much celebrated in his days that it became a proverb
amongst the Chaldeans when any one would express an extraordinary
wisdom to say he was as wise as Daniel

284 In thy wisdom and thy understanding thou hast made thyself
strong and hast gotten gold an silver into thy treasures

285 By the greatness of thy wisdom and by thy traffic thou hast
increased thy strength and thy heart is lifted up with thy strength

286 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because thy heart is lifted
up as the heart of God

287 Therefore behold I will bring upon thee strangers the strongest
of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of
thy wisdom and they shall defile thy beauty

288 They shall kill thee and bring thee down and thou shalt die the
death of them that are slain in the heart of the sea

289 Wilt thou yet say before them that slay thee I am God whereas
thou art a man and not God in the hand of them that slay thee

2810 Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of
strangers for I have spoken it saith the Lord God

2811 And the word of the Lord came to me saying Son of man take up
a lamentation upon the king of Tyre

2812 And say to him Thus saith the Lord God Thou wast the seal of
resemblance full of wisdom and perfect in beauty

Thou wast the seal of resemblance  The king of Tyre by his dignity
and his natural perfections bore in himself a certain resemblance to
God by reason of which he might be called the seal of resemblance
etc But what is here said to him is commonly understood of Lucifer
the king over all the children of pride

2813 Thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of God every
precious stone was thy covering the sardius the topaz and the
jasper the chrysolite and the onyx and the beryl the sapphire and
the carbuncle and the emerald gold the work of thy beauty and thy
pipes were prepared in the day that thou wast created

2814 Thou a cherub stretched out and protecting and I set thee in
the holy mountain of God thou hast walked in the midst of the stones
of fire

A cherub stretched out  That is thy wings extended This alludes to
the figure of the cherubims in the sanctuary which with stretched out
wings covered the arkIbid The stones of fire  That is bright and
precious stones which sparkle like fire

2815 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation
until iniquity was found in thee

2816 By the multitude of thy merchandise thy inner parts were filled
with iniquity and thou hast sinned and I cast thee out from the
mountain of God and destroyed thee O covering cherub out of the
midst of the stones of fire

2817 And thy heart was lifted up with thy beauty thou hast lost thy
wisdom in thy beauty I have cast thee to the ground I have set thee
before the face of kings that they might behold thee

2818 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy
iniquities and by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore I will bring
forth a fire from the midst of thee to devour thee and I will make
thee as ashes upon the earth in the sight of all that see thee

2819 All that shall see thee among the nations shall be astonished
at thee thou art brought to nothing and thou shalt never be any more

2820 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

2821 Son of man set thy face against Sidon and thou shalt prophesy
of it

2822 And shalt say Thus saith the Lord God Behold I come against
thee Sidon and I will be glorified in the midst of thee and they
shall know that I am the Lord when I shall execute judgments in her
and shall be sanctified in her

2823 And I will send into her pestilence and blood in her streets
and they shall fall being slain by the sword on all sides in the midst
thereof and they shall know that I am the Lord

2824 And the house of Israel shall have no more a stumblingblock of
bitterness nor a thorn causing pain on every side round about them of
them that are against them and they shall know that I am the Lord God

2825 Thus saith the Lord God When I shall have gathered together the
house of Israel out of the people among whom they are scattered I will
be sanctified in them before the Gentiles and they shall dwell in
their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob

2826 And they shall dwell therein secure and they shall build
houses and shall plant vineyards and shall dwell with confidence
when I shall have executed judgments upon all that are their enemies
round about and they shall know that I am the Lord their God



Ezechiel Chapter 29


The king of Egypt shall be overthrown and his kingdom wasted it shall
be given to Nabuchodonosor for his service against Tyre

291 In the tenth year the tenth month the eleventh day of the
month the word of the Lord came to me saying

292 Son of man set thy face against Pharao king of Egypt and thou
shalt prophesy of him and of all Egypt

293 Speak and say Thus saith the Lord God Behold I come against
thee Pharao king of Egypt thou great dragon that liest in the midst
of thy rivers and sayest The river is mine and I made myself

294 But I will put a bridle in thy jaws and I will cause the fish of
thy rivers to stick to thy scales and I will draw thee out of the
midst of thy rivers and all thy fish shall stick to thy scales

295 And I will cast thee forth into the desert and all the fish of
thy river thou shalt fall upon the face of the earth thou shalt not
be taken up nor gathered together I have given thee for meat to the
beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the air

296 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord
because thou hast been a staff of a reed to the house of Israel

297 When they took hold of thee with the hand thou didst break and
rent all their shoulder and when they leaned upon thee thou brokest
and weakenest all their loins

298 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold I will bring the sword
upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee

299 And the land of Egypt shall become a desert and a wilderness
and they shall know that I am the Lord because thou hast said The
river is mine and I made it

2910 Therefore behold I come against thee and thy rivers and I
will make the land of Egypt utterly desolate and wasted by the sword
from the tower of Syene even to the borders of Ethiopia

2911 The foot of man shall not pass through it neither shall the
foot of beasts go through it nor shall it be inhabited during forty
years

2912 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
lands that are desolate and the cities thereof in the midst of the
cites that are destroyed and they shall be desolate for forty years
and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse
them through the countries

2913 For thus saith the Lord God At the end of forty years I will
gather the Egyptians from the people among whom they had been
scattered

2914 And I will bring back the captivity of Egypt and will place
them in the land of Phatures in the land of their nativity and they
shall be there a low kingdom

2915 It shall be the lowest among other kingdoms and it shall no
more be exalted over the nations and I will diminish them that they
shall rule no more over the nations

2916 And they shall be no more a confidence to the house of Israel
teaching iniquity that they may flee and follow them and they shall
know that I am the Lord God

2917 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first
month in the first of the month that the word of the Lord came to me
saying

2918 Son of man Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath made his army to
undergo hard service against Tyre every head was made bald and every
shoulder was peeled and there hath been no reward given him nor his
army for Tyre for the service that he rendered me against it

2919 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold I will set
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon in the land of Egypt and he shall
take her multitude and take the booty thereof for a prey and rifle
the spoils thereof and it shall be wages for his army

2920 And for the service that he hath done me against it I have
given him the land of Egypt because he hath laboured for me saith the
Lord God

2921 In that day a horn shall bud forth to the house of Israel and I
will give thee an open mouth in the midst of them and they shall know
that I am the Lord



Ezechiel Chapter 30


The desolation of Egypt and her helpers all her cities shall be
wasted

301 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

302 Son of man prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord God Howl ye
Woe woe to the day

303 For the day is near yea the day of the Lord is near a cloudy
day it shall be the time of the nations

304 And the sword shall come upon Egypt and there shall be dread in
Ethiopia when the wounded shall fall in Egypt and the multitude
thereof shall be taken away and the foundations thereof shall be
destroyed

305 Ethiopia and Libya and Lydia and all the rest of the crowd
and Chub and the children of the land of the covenant shall fall with
them by the sword

306 Thus saith the Lord God They also that uphold Egypt shall fall
and the pride of her empire shall be brought down from the tower of
Syene shall they fall in it by the sword saith the Lord the God of
hosts

307 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the lands that are
desolate and the cities thereof shall be in the midst of the cities
that are wasted

308 And they shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have set a
fire in Egypt and all the helpers thereof shall be destroyed

309 In that day shall messengers go forth from my face in ships to
destroy the confidence of Ethiopia and there shall be dread among them
in the day of Egypt because it shall certainly come

3010 Thus saith the Lord God I will make the multitude of Egypt to
cease by the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon

3011 He and his people with him the strongest of nations shall be
brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords upon
Egypt and shall fill the land with the slain

3012 And I will make the channels of the rivers dry and will deliver
the land into the hand of the wicked and will lay waste the land and
all that is therein by the hands of strangers I the Lord have spoken
it

3013 Thus saith the Lord God I will also destroy the idols and I
will make an end of the idols of Memphis and there shall be no more a
prince of the land of Egypt and I will cause a terror in the land of
Egypt

3014 And I will destroy the land of Phatures and will make a fire in
Taphnis and will execute judgments in Alexandria

Alexandria  In the Hebrew No which was the ancient name of that
city which was afterwards rebuilt by Alexander the Great and from his
name called Alexandria

3015 And I will pour out my indignation upon Pelusium the strength of
Egypt and will cut off the multitude of Alexandria

3016 And I will make a fire in Egypt Pelusium shall be in pain like
a woman in labour and Alexandria shall be laid waste and in Memphis
there shall be daily distresses

3017 The young men of Heliopolis and of Bubastus shall fall by the
sword and they themselves shall go into captivity

3018 And in Taphnis the day shall be darkened when I shall break
there the sceptres of Egypt and the pride of her power shall cease in
her a cloud shall cover her and her daughters shall be led into
captivity

3019 And I will execute judgments in Egypt and they shall know that
I am the Lord

3020 And it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month in
the seventh day of the month that the word of the Lord came me
saying

3021 Son of man I have broken the arm of Pharao king of Egypt and
behold it is not bound up to be healed to be tied up with clothes
and swathed with linen that it might recover strength and hold the
sword

3022 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold I come against
Pharao king of Egypt and I will break into pieces his strong arm
which is already broken and I will cause the sword to fall out of his
hand

3023 And I will disperse Egypt among the nations and scatter them
through the countries

3024 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and will
put my sword in his hand and I will break the arms of Pharao and they
shall groan bitterly being slain before his face

3025 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and the
arms of Pharao shall fall and they shall know that I am the Lord when
I shall have given my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and
he shall have stretched it forth upon the land of Egypt

3026 And I will disperse Egypt among the nations and will scatter
them through the countries and they shall know that I am the Lord



Ezechiel Chapter 31


The Assyrian empire fell for their pride the Egyptian shall fall in
like manner

311 And it came to pass in the eleventh year the third month the
first day of the month that the word of the Lord came to me saying

312 Son of man speak to Pharao king of Egypt and to his people To
whom art thou like in thy greatness

313 Behold the Assyrian like a cedar in Libanus with fair branches
and full of leaves of a high stature and his top was elevated among
the thick boughs

314 The waters nourished him the deep set him tip on high the
streams thereof ran round about his roots and it sent forth its
rivulets to all the trees of the country

315 Therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the
country and his branches were multiplied and his boughs were elevated
because of many waters

316 And when he had spread forth his shadow all the fowls of the air
made their nests in his boughs and all the beasts of the forest
brought forth their young under his branches and the assembly of many
nations dwelt under his shadow

317 And he was most beautiful for his greatness and for the
spreading of his branches for his root was near great waters

318 The cedars in the paradise of God were not higher than he the
fir trees did not equal his top neither were the plane trees to be
compared with him for branches no tree in the paradise of God was like
him in his beauty

319 For I made him beautiful and thick set with many branches and
all the trees of pleasure that were in the paradise of God envied
him

3110 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because he was exalted in
height and shot up his top green and thick and his heart was lifted
up in his height

3111 I have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the
nations he shall deal with him I have cast him out according to his
wickedness

I have delivered  Here the time past is put for the future i e I
shall deliverIbid The mighty one etc  Viz Nabuchodonosor who
conquered both the Assyrians and Egyptians

3112 And strangers and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him
down and cast him away upon the mountains and his boughs shall fall
in every valley and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the
country and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow
and leave him

3113 All the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins and all the
beasts of the field were among his branches

3114 For which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt
themselves for their height nor shoot up their tops among the thick
branches and leaves neither shall any of them that are watered stand
up in their height for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest
parts of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that
go down into the pit

3115 Thus saith the Lord God In the day when he went down to hell I
brought in mourning I covered him with the deep and I withheld its
rivers and restrained the many waters Libanus grieved for him and
all the trees of the field trembled

3116 I shook the nations with the sound of his fall when I brought
him down to hell with them that descend into the pit and all the trees
of pleasure the choice and best in Libanus all that were moistened
with waters were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth

3117 For they also shall go down with him to hell to them that are
slain by the sword and the arm of every one shall sit down under his
shadow in the midst of the nations

3118 To whom art thou like O thou that art famous and lofty among
the trees of pleasure Behold thou art brought down with the trees of
pleasure to the lowest parts of the earth thou shalt sleep in the
midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword this
is Pharao and all his multitude saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 32


The prophets lamentation for the king of Egypt

321 And it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in
the first day of the month that the word of the Lord came to me
saying

322 Son of man take up a lamentation for Pharao the king of Egypt
and say to him Thou art like the lion of the nations and the dragon
that is in the sea and thou didst push with the horn in thy rivers
and didst trouble the waters with thy feet and didst trample upon
their streams

323 Therefore thus saith the Lord God I will spread out my net over
thee with the multitude of many people and I will draw thee up in my
net

324 And I will throw thee out on the land I will cast thee away into
the open field and I will cause all the fowls of the air to dwell upon
thee and I will fill the beasts of all the earth with thee

325 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and will fill thy
hills with thy corruption

326 And I will water the earth with thy stinking blood upon the
mountains and the valleys shall be filled with thee

327 And I will cover the heavens when thou shalt be put out and I
will make the stars thereof dark I will cover the sun with a cloud
and the moon shall not give her light

328 I will make all the lights of heaven to mourn over thee and I
will cause darkness upon thy land saith the Lord God when thy wounded
shall fall in the midst of the land saith the Lord God

329 And I shall provoke to anger the heart of many people when I
shall have brought in thy destruction among the nations upon the lands
which thou knowest not

3210 And I will make many people to be amazed at thee and their
kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when my sword shall begin to
fly upon their faces and they shall be astonished on a sudden every
one for his own life in the day of their ruin

3211 For thus saith the Lord God The sword of the king of Babylon
shall come upon thee

3212 By the swords of the mighty I will overthrow thy multitude all
these nations are invincible and they shall waste the pride of Egypt
and the multitude thereof shall be destroyed

3213 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof that were beside the
great waters and the foot of man shall trouble them no more neither
shall the hoof of beasts trouble them

3214 Then will I make their waters clear and cause their rivers to
run like oil saith the Lord God

3215 When I shall have made the land of Egypt desolate and the land
shall be destitute of her fulness when I shall have struck all the
inhabitants thereof and they shall know that I am the Lord

3216 This is the lamentation and they shall lament therewith the
daughters of the nations shall lament therewith for Egypt and for the
multitude thereof they shall lament therewith saith the Lord God

3217 And it came to pass in the twelfth year in the fifteenth day of
the month that the word of the Lord came to me saying

3218 Son of man sing a mournful song for the multitude of Egypt and
cast her down both her and the daughters of the mighty nations to the
lowest part of the earth with them that go down into the pit

3219 Whom dost thou excel in beauty go down and sleep with the
uncircumcised

3220 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain with the
sword the sword is given they have drawn her down and all her
people

3221 The most mighty among the strong ones shall speak to him from
the midst of hell they that went down with his helpers and slept
uncircumcised slain by the sword

3222 Assur is there and all his multitude their graves are round
about him all of them slain and that fell by the sword

3223 Whose graves are set in the lowest parts of the pit and his
multitude lay round about his grave all of them slain and fallen by
the sword they that heretofore spread terror in the land of the
living

3224 There is Elam and all his multitude round about his grave all
of them slain and fallen by the sword that went down uncircumcised to
the lowest parts of the earth that caused their terror in the land of
the living and they have borne their shame with them that go down into
the pit

3225 In the midst of the slain they have set him a bed among all his
people their graves are round about him all these are uncircumcised
and slain by the sword for they spread their terror in the land of the
living and have borne their shame with them that descend into the pit
they are laid in the midst of the slain

3226 There is Mosoch and Thubal and all their multitude their
graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised and slain and
fallen by the sword though they spread their terror in the land of the
living

3227 And they shall not sleep with the brave and with them that fell
uncircumcised that went down to hell with their weapons and laid
their swords under their heads and their iniquities were in their
bones because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the
living

3228 So thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised
and shalt sleep with them that are slain by the sword

3229 There is Edom and her kings and all her princes who with
their army are joined with them that are slain by the sword and have
slept with the uncircumcised and with them that go down into the pit

3230 There are all the princes of the north and all the hunters who
were brought down with the slain fearing and confounded in their
strength who slept uncircumcised with them that are slain by the
sword and have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit

3231 Pharao saw them and he was comforted concerning all his
multitude which was slain by the sword Pharao and all his army
saith the Lord God

3232 Because I have spread my terror in the land of the living and
he hath slept in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are
slain by the sword Pharao and all his multitude saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 33


The duty of the watchman appointed by God the justice of Gods ways
his judgments upon the Jews

331 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

332 Son of man speak to the children of thy people and say to them
When I bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a
man one of their meanest and make him a watchman over them

333 And he sees the sword coming upon the land and sound the
trumpet and tell the people

334 Then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet whosoever he be
and doth not look to himself if the sword come and cut him off his
blood shall be upon his own head

335 He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not look to himself
his blood shall be upon him but if he look to himself he shall save
his life

336 And if the watchman see the sword coming and sound not the
trumpet and the people look not to themselves and the sword come and
cut off a soul from among them he indeed is taken away in his
iniquity but I will require his blood at the hand of the watchman

337 So thou O son of man I have made thee a watchman to the house
of Israel therefore thou shalt hear the word from my mouth and shalt
tell it them from me

338 When I say to the wicked O wicked man thou shalt surely die if
thou dost not speak to warn the wicked man from his way that wicked
man shall die in his iniquity but I will require his blood at thy
hand

339 But if thou tell the wicked man that he may be converted from
his ways and he be not converted from his way he shall die in his
iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul

3310 Thou therefore O son of man say to the house of Israel Thus
you have spoken saying Our iniquities and our sins are upon us and
we pine away in them how then can we live

3311 Say to them As I live saith the Lord God I desire not the
death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live
Turn ye turn ye from your evil ways and why will you die O house of
Israel

3312 Thou therefore O son of man say to the children of thy people
The justice of the just shall not deliver him in what day soever he
shall sin and the wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him in what
day soever he shall turn from his wickedness and the just shall not be
able to live in his justice in what day soever he shall sin

3313 Yea if I shall say to the just that he shall surely live and
he trusting in his justice commit iniquity all his justices shall be
forgotten and his iniquity which he hath committed in the same shall
he die

3314 And it I shall say to the wicked Thou shalt surely die and he
do penance for his sin and do judgment and justice

3315 And if that wicked man restore the pledge and render what he
had robbed and walk in the commandments of life and do no unjust
thing he shall surely live and shall not die

3316 None of his sins which he hath committed shall be imputed to
him he hath done judgment and justice he shall surely live

3317 And the children of thy people have said The way of the Lord is
not equitable whereas their own way is unjust

3318 For when the just shall depart from his justice and commit
iniquities he shall die in them

3319 And when the wicked shall depart from his wickedness and shall
do judgments and justice he shall live in them

3320 And you say The way of the Lord is not right I will judge
every one of you according to his ways O house of Israel

3321 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the
tenth month in the fifth day of the month that there came to me one
that was fled from Jerusalem saying The city is laid waste

3322 And the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening before
he that was fled came and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the
morning and my mouth being opened I was silent no more

3323 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

3324 Son of man they that dwell in these ruinous places in the land
of Israel speak saying Abraham was one and he inherited the land
but we are many the land is given us in possession

3325 Therefore say to them Thus saith the Lord God You that eat
with the blood and lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses and that
shed blood shall you possess the land by inheritance

3326 You stood on your swords you have committed abominations and
every one hath defiled his neighbours wife and shall you possess the
land by inheritance

3327 Say thou thus to them Thus saith the Lord God As I live they
that dwell in the ruinous places shall fall by the sword and he that
is in the field shall be given to the beasts to be devoured and they
that are in holds and caves shall die of the pestilence

3328 And I will make the land a wilderness and a desert and the
proud strength thereof shall fail and the mountains of Israel shall be
desolate because there is none to pass by them

3329 And they shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have made
their land waste and desolate for all their abominations which they
have committed

3330 And thou son of man the children of thy people that talk of
thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to
another each man to his neighbour saying Come and let us hear what
is the word that cometh forth from the Lord

3331 And they come to thee as if people were coming in and my
people sit before thee and hear thy words and do them not for they
turn them into a song of their mouth and their heart goeth after their
covetousness

3332 And thou art to them as a musical song which is sung with a
sweet and agreeable voice and they hear thy words and do them not

3333 And when that which was foretold shall come to pass for behold
it is coming then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them



Ezechiel Chapter 34


Evil pastors are reproved Christ the true pastor shall come and
gather together his flock from all parts of the earth and preserve it
for ever

341 And the word of the Lord came to me it saying

342 Son of man prophesy concerning the shepherds of Israel
prophesy and say to the shepherds Thus saith the Lord God Woe to the
shepherds of Israel that fed themselves should not the flocks be fed
by the shepherds

Shepherds  That is princes magistrates chief priests and scribes

343 You ate the milk and you clothed yourselves with the wool and
you killed that which was fat but my flock you did not feed

344 The weak you have not strengthened and that which was sick you
have not healed that which was broken you have not bound up and that
which was driven away you have not brought again neither have you
sought that which was lost but you ruled over them with rigour and
with a high hand

345 And my sheep were scattered because there was no shepherd and
they became the prey of all the beasts of the field and were
scattered

346 My sheep have wandered in every mountain and in every high hill
and my flocks were scattered upon the face of the earth and there was
none that sought them there was none I say that sought them

347 Therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the Lord

348 As I live saith the Lord God forasmuch as my flocks have been
made a spoil and my sheep are become a prey to all the beasts of the
field because there was no shepherd for my shepherds did not seek
after my flock but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not my
flocks

349 Therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the Lord

3410 Thus saith the Lord God Behold I myself come upon the
shepherds I will require my flock at their hand and I will cause them
to cease from feeding the flock any more neither shall the shepherds
feed themselves any more and I will deliver my flock from their mouth
and it shall no more be meat for them

3411 For thus saith the Lord God Behold I myself will seek my sheep
and will visit them

3412 As the shepherd visiteth his flock in the day when he shall be
in the midst of his sheep that were scattered so will I visit my
sheep and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been
scattered in the cloudy and dark day

3413 And I will bring them out from the peoples and will gather them
out of the countries and will bring them to their own land and I will
feed them in the mountains of Israel by the rivers and in all the
habitations of the land

3414 I will feed them in the most fruitful pastures and their
pastures shall be in the high mountains of Israel there shall they
rest on the green grass and be fed in fat pastures upon the mountains
of Israel

3415 I will feed my sheep and I will cause them to lie down saith
the Lord God

3416 I will seek that which was lost and that which was driven away
I will bring again and I will bind up that which was broken and I
will strengthen that which was weak and that which was fat and strong
I will preserve and I will feed them in judgment

3417 And as for you O my flocks thus saith the Lord God Behold I
judge between cattle and cattle of rams and of he goats

3418 Was it not enough for you to feed upon good pastures but you
must also tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures and
when you drank the clearest water you troubled the rest with your
feet

3419 And my sheep were fed with that which you had trodden with your
feet and they drank what your feet had troubled

3420 Therefore thus saith the Lord God to you Behold I myself will
judge between the fat cattle and the lean

3421 Because you thrusted with sides and shoulders and struck all
the weak cattle with your horns till they were scattered abroad

3422 I will save my flock and it shall be no more a spoil and I
will judge between cattle and cattle

3423 And I WILL SET UP ONE SHEPHERD OVER THEM and he shall feed
them even my servant David he shall feed them and he shall be their
shepherd

David  Christ who is of the house of David

3424 And I the Lord will be their God and my servant David the
prince in the midst of them I the Lord have spoken it

3425 And I will make a covenant of peace with them and will cause
the evil beasts to cease out of the land and they that dwell in the
wilderness shall sleep secure in the forests

3426 And I will make them a blessing round about my hill and I will
send down the rain in its season there shall be showers of blessing

3427 And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit and the earth
shall yield her increase and they shall be in their land without fear
and they shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have broken the
bonds of their yoke and shall have delivered them out of the hand of
those that rule over them

3428 And they shall be no more for a spoil to the nations neither
shall the beasts of the earth devour them but they shall dwell
securely without any terror

3429 And I will raise up for them a bud of renown and they shall be
no more consumed with famine in the land neither shall they bear any
more the reproach of the Gentiles

A bud of renown  Germen nominatum He speaks of Christ our Lord the
illustrious bud of the house of David renowned over all the earth See
Jer 3315

3430 And they shall know that I the Lord their God am with them and
that they are my people the house of Israel saith the Lord God

3431 And you my flocks the flocks of my pasture are men and I am
the Lord your God saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 35


The judgment of mount Seir for their hatred of Israel

351 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

352 Son of man set thy face against mount Seir and prophesy
concerning it and say to it

353 Thus saith the Lord God Behold I come against thee mount Seir
and I will stretch forth my hand upon thee and I will make thee
desolate and waste

354 I will destroy thy cities and thou shalt be desolate and thou
shalt know that I am the Lord

355 Because thou hast been an everlasting enemy and hast shut up the
children of Israel in the hands of the sword in the time of their
affliction in the time of their last iniquity

356 Therefore as I live saith the Lord God I will deliver thee up
to blood and blood shall pursue thee and whereas thou hast hated
blood blood shall pursue thee

357 And I will make mount Seir waste and desolate and I will take
away from it him that goeth and him that returneth

358 And I will fill his mountains with his men that are slain in thy
hills and in thy valleys and in thy torrents they shall fall that are
slain with the sword

359 I will make thee everlasting desolations and thy cities shall
not be inhabited and thou shalt know that I am the Lord God

3510 Because thou hast said The two nations and the two lands shall
be mine and I will possess them by inheritance whereas the Lord was
there

3511 Therefore as I live saith the Lord God I will do according to
thy wrath and according to thy envy which thou hast exercised in
hatred to them and I will be made known by them when I shall have
judged thee

3512 And thou shalt know that I the Lord have heard all thy
reproaches that thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel
saying They are desolate they are given to us to consume

3513 And you rose up against me with your mouth and have derogated
from me by your words I have heard them

3514 Thus saith the Lord God When the whole earth shall rejoice I
will make thee a wilderness

3515 As thou hast rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of
Israel because it was laid waste so will I do to thee thou shalt be
laid waste O mount Seir and all Idumea and they shall know that I am
the Lord



Ezechiel Chapter 36


The restoration of Israel not for their merits but by Gods special
grace Christs baptism

361 And thou son of man prophesy to the mountains of Israel and
say Ye mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord

362 Thus saith the Lord God Because the enemy hath said to you Aha
the everlasting heights are given to us for an inheritance

363 Therefore prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord God Because you
have been desolate and trodden under foot on every side and made an
inheritance to the rest of the nations and are become the subject of
the talk and the reproach of the people

364 Therefore ye mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord God
Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains and to the hills to the
brooks and to the valleys and to desolate places and ruinous walls
and to the cities that are forsaken that are spoiled and derided by
the rest of the nations round about

365 Therefore thus saith the Lord God In the fire of my zeal I have
spoken of the rest of the nations and of all Edom who have taken my
land to themselves for an inheritance with joy and with all the
heart and with the mind and have cast it out to lay it waste

366 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel and say to the
mountains and to the hills to the ridges and to the valleys Thus
saith the Lord God Behold I have spoken in my zeal and in my
indignation because you have borne the shame of the Gentiles

367 Therefore thus saith the Lord God I have lifted up my hand that
the Gentiles who are round about you shall themselves bear their
shame

368 But as for you O mountains of Israel shoot ye forth your
branches and yield your fruit to my people of Israel for they are at
hand to come

369 For I I am for you and I will turn to you and you shall be
ploughed and sown

3610 And I will multiply men upon you and all the house of Israel
and the cities ball be inhabited and the ruinous places shall be
repaired

3611 And I will make you abound with men and with beasts and they
shall be multiplied and increased and I will settle you as from the
beginning and will give you greater gifts than you had from the
beginning and you shall know that I am the Lord

3612 And I will bring men upon you my people Israel and they shall
possess thee for their inheritance and thou shalt be their
inheritance and shalt no more henceforth be without them

3613 Thus saith the Lord God Because thy say of you Thou art a
devourer of men and one that suffocatest thy nation

3614 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more nor destroy thy nation
any more saith the Lord God

3615 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
nations any more nor shalt thou bear the reproach of the people nor
lose thy nation any more saith the Lord God

Nor lose thy nation any more  This whole promise principally relates
to the church of Christ and Gods perpetual protection of her for as
the carnal Jews they have been removed out of their land these sixteen
hundred years

3616 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

3617 Son of man when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land
they defiled it with their ways and with their doings their way was
before me like the uncleanness of a menstruous woman

3618 And I poured out my indignation upon them for the blood which
they had shed upon the land and with their idols they defiled it

3619 And I scattered them among the nations and they are dispersed
through the countries I have judged them according to their ways and
their devices

3620 And when they entered among the nations whither they went they
profaned my holy name when it was said of them This is the people of
the Lord and they are come forth out of his land

3621 And I have regarded my own holy name which the house of Israel
hath profaned among the nations to which they went in

3622 Therefore thou shalt say to the house of Israel Thus saith the
Lord God It is not for your sake that I will do this O house of
Israel but for my holy names sake which you have profaned among the
nations whither you went

3623 And I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the
Gentiles which you have profaned in the midst of them that the
Gentiles may know that I am the Lord saith the Lord of hosts when I
shall be sanctified in you before their eyes

3624 For I will take you from among the Gentiles and will gather you
together out of all the countries and will bring you into your own
land

3625 And I will pour upon you clean water and you shall be cleansed
from all your filthiness and I will cleanse you from all your idols

3626 And I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within
you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and will
give you a heart of flesh

3627 And I will put my spirit in the midst of you and I will cause
you to walk in my commandments and to keep my judgments and do them

3628 And you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers
and you shall be my people and I will be your God

3629 And I will save you from all your uncleannesses and I will call
for corn and will multiply it and will lay no famine upon you

3630 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of
the field that you bear no more the reproach of famine among the
nations

3631 And you shall remember your wicked ways and your doings that
were not good and your iniquities and your wicked deeds shall
displease you

3632 It is not for your sakes that I will do this saith the Lord
God be it known to you be confounded and ashamed at your own ways O
house of Israel

3633 Thus saith the Lord God In the day that I shall cleanse you
from all your iniquities and shall cause the cities to be inhabited
and shall repair the ruinous places

3634 And the desolate land shall be tilled which before was waste in
the sight of all that passed by

3635 They shall say This land that was untilled is become as a
garden of pleasure and the cities that were abandoned and desolate
and destroyed are peopled and fenced

3636 And the nations that shall be left round about you shall know
that I the Lord have built up what was destroyed and planted what was
desolate that I the Lord have spoken and done it

3637 Thus saith the Lord God Moreover in this shall the house of
Israel find me that I will do it for them I will multiply them as a
flock of men

3638 As a holy flock as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts
so shall the waste cities be full of flocks of men and they shall know
that I am the Lord



Ezechiel Chapter 37


A vision of the resurrection of dry bones foreshewing the deliverance
of the people from their captivity Juda and Israel shall be all one
kingdom under Christ Gods everlasting covenant with the church

371 The hand of the Lord was upon me and brought me forth in the
spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of a plain that was
full of bones

372 And he led me about through them on every side now they were
very many upon the face of the plain and they were exceeding dry

373 And he said to me Son of man dost thou think these bones shall
live and I answered O Lord God thou knowest

374 And he said to me Prophesy concerning these bones and say to
them Ye dry bones hear the word of the Lord

375 Thus saith the Lord God to these bones Behold I will send
spirit into you and you shall live

Spirit  That is soul life and breath

376 And I will lay sinews upon you and will cause flesh to grow over
you and will cover you with skin and I will give you spirit and you
shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord

377 And I prophesied as he had commanded me and as I prophesied
there was a noise and behold a commotion and the bones came together
each one its joint

378 And I saw and behold the sinews and the flesh came up upon
them and the skin was stretched out over them but there was no spirit
in them

379 And he said to me Prophesy to the spirit prophesy O son of
man and say to the spirit Thus saith the Lord God Come spirit from
the four winds and blow upon these slain and let them live again

3710 And I prophesied as he had commanded me and the spirit came
into them and they lived and they stood up upon their feet an
exceeding great army

3711 And he said to me Son of man All these bones are the house of
Israel they say Our bones are dried up and our hope is lost and we
are cut off

3712 Therefore prophesy and say to them Thus saith the Lord God
Behold I will open your graves and will bring you out of your
sepulchres O my people and will bring you into the land of Israel

3713 And you shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have opened
your sepulchres and shall have brought you out of your graves O my
people

3714 And shall have put my spirit in you and you shall live and I
shall make you rest upon your own land and you shall know that I the
Lord have spoken and done it saith the Lord God

3715 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

3716 And thou son of man take thee a stick and write upon it Of
Juda and of the children of Israel his associates and take another
stick and write upon it For Joseph the stick of Ephraim and for all
the house of Israel and of his associates

3717 And join them one to the other into one stick and they shall
become one in thy hand

3718 And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee saying
Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by this

3719 Say to them Thus saith the Lord God Behold I will take the
stick of Joseph which is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of
Israel that are associated with him and I will put them together with
the stick of Juda and will make them one stick and they shall be one
in his hand

3720 And the sticks whereon thou hast written shall be in thy hand
before their eyes

3721 And thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord God Behold I
will take of the children of Israel from the midst of the nations
whither they are gone and I will gather them on every side and will
bring them to their own land

3722 And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of
Israel and one king shall be king over them all and they shall no
more be two nations neither shall they be divided any more into two
kingdoms

3723 Nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols nor with
their abominations nor with all their iniquities and I will save them
out of all the places in which they have sinned and I will cleanse
them and they shall be my people and I will be their God

3724 And my servant David shall be king over them and they shall
have one shepherd they shall walk in my judgments and shall keep my
commandments and shall do them

3725 And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant
Jacob wherein your fathers dwelt and they shall dwell in it they and
their children and their childrens children for ever and David my
servant shall be their prince for ever

3726 And I will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an
everlasting covenant with them and I will establish them and will
multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever

3727 And my tabernacle shall be with them and I will be their God
and they shall be my people

3728 And the nations shall know that I am the Lord the sanctifier of
Israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever



Ezechiel Chapter 38


Gog shall persecute the church in the latter days He shall be
overthrown

381 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

382 Son of man set thy face against Gog the land of Magog the
chief prince of Mosoch and Thubal and prophesy of him

Gog  This name which signifies hidden or covered is taken in this
place either for the persecutors of the church of God in general or
some archpersecutor in particular such as Antichrist shall be in the
latter days See Apoc 208 And what is said of the punishment of Gog
is verified by the unhappy ends of persecutorsIbid Magog  Scythia
or Tartary from whence the Turks and other enemies of the church of
Christ originally sprung

383 And say to him Thus saith the Lord God Behold I come against
thee O Gog the chief prince of Mosoch and Thubal

384 And I will turn thee about and I will put a bit in thy jaws and
I will bring thee forth and all thy army horses and horsemen all
clothed with coats of mail a great multitude armed with spears and
shields and swords

385 The Persians Ethiopians and Libyans with them all with shields
and helmets

386 Gomer and all his bands the house of Thogorma the northern
parts and all his strength and many peoples with thee

387 Prepare and make thyself ready and all thy multitude that is
assembled about thee and be thou commander over them

388 After many days thou shalt be visited at the end of years thou
shalt come to the land that is returned from the sword and is gathered
out of many nations to the mountains of Israel which have been
continually waste but it hath been brought forth out of the nations
and they shall all of them dwell securely in it

389 And thou shalt go up and come like a storm and like a cloud to
cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with thee

3810 Thus saith the Lord God In that day projects shall enter into
thy heart and thou shalt conceive a mischievous design

3811 And thou shalt say I will go up to the land which is without a
wall I will come to them that are at rest and dwell securely all
these dwell without a wall they have no bars nor gates

3812 To take spoils and lay hold on the prey to lay thy hand upon
them that had been wasted and afterwards restored and upon the people
that is gathered together out of the nations which hath begun to
possess and to dwell in the midst of the earth

3813 Saba and Dedan and the merchants of Tharsis and all the lions
thereof shall say to thee Art thou come to take spoils behold thou
hast gathered thy multitude to take a prey to take silver and gold
and to carry away goods and substance and to take rich spoils

3814 Therefore thou son of man prophesy and say to Gog Thus saith
the Lord God Shalt thou not know in that day when my people of
Israel shall dwell securely

3815 And thou shalt come out of thy place from the northern parts
thou and many people with thee all of them riding upon horses a great
company and a mighty army

3816 And thou shalt come upon my people of Israel like a cloud to
cover the earth Thou shalt be in the latter days and I will bring
thee upon my land that the nations may know me when I shall be
sanctified in thee O Gog before their eyes

3817 Thus saith the Lord God Thou then art he of whom I have spoken
in the days of old by my servants the prophets of Israel who
prophesied in the days of those times that I would bring thee upon
them

3818 And it shall come to pass in that day in the day of the coming
of Gog upon the land of Israel saith the Lord God that my indignation
shall come up in my wrath

3819 And I have spoken in my zeal and in the fire of my anger that
in that day there shall be a great commotion upon the land of Israel

3820 So that the fishes of the sea and the birds of the air and the
beasts of the field and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
ground and all men that are upon the face of the earth shall be moved
at my presence and the mountains shall be thrown down and the hedges
shall fall and every wall shall fall to the ground

3821 And I will call in the sword against him in all my mountains
saith the Lord God every mans sword shall be pointed against his
brother

3822 And I will judge him with pestilence and with blood and with
violent rain and vast hailstones I will rain fire and brimstone upon
him and upon his army and upon the many nations that are with him

3823 And I will be magnified and I will be sanctified and I will be
known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that I am the
Lord



Ezechiel Chapter 39


Gods judgments upon Gog Gods people were punished for their sins
but shall be favoured with everlasting kindness

391 And thou son of man prophesy against Gog and say Thus saith
the Lord God Behold I come against thee O Gog the chief prince of
Mosoch and Thubal

392 And I will turn thee round and I will lead thee out and will
make thee go up from the northern parts and will bring thee upon the
mountains of Israel

393 And I will break thy bow in thy left hand and I will cause thy
arrows to fall out of thy right hand

394 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel thou and all thy
bands and thy nations that are with thee I have given thee to the
wild beasts to the birds and to every fowl and to the beasts of the
earth to be devoured

395 Thou shalt fall upon the face of the field for I have spoken it
saith the Lord God

396 And I will send a fire on Magog and on them that dwell
confidently in the islands and they shall know that I am the Lord

397 And I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people
Israel and my holy name shall be profaned no more and the Gentiles
shall know that I am the Lord the Holy One of Israel

398 Behold it cometh and it is done saith the Lord God this is the
day whereof I have spoken

399 And the inhabitants shall go forth of the cities of Israel and
shall set on fire and burn the weapons the shields and the spears
the bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the pikes and they
shall burn them with fire seven years

3910 And they shall not bring wood out of the countries nor cut down
out of the forests for they shall burn the weapons with fire and
shall make a prey of them to whom they had been a prey and they shall
rob those that robbed them saith the Lord God

3911 And it shall come to pass in that day that I will give Gog a
noted place for a sepulchre in Israel the valley of the passengers on
the east of the sea which shall cause astonishment in them that pass
by and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude and it shall
be called the valley of the multitude of Gog

3912 And the house of Israel shall bury them for seven months to
cleanse the land

3913 And all the people of the land shall bury him and it shall be
unto them a noted day wherein I was glorified saith the Lord God

3914 And they shall appoint men to go continually about the land to
bury and to seek out them that were remaining upon the face of the
earth that they may cleanse it and after seven months they shall
begin to seek

3915 And they shall go about passing through the land and when they
shall see the bone of a man they shall set up sign by it till the
buriers bury it in the valley of the multitude of Gog

3916 And the name of the city shall be Amona and they shall cleanse
the land

3917 And thou O son of man saith the Lord God say to every fowl
and to all the birds and to all the beasts of the field Assemble
yourselves make haste come together from every side to my victim
which I slay for you a great victim upon the mountains of Israel to
eat flesh and drink blood

3918 You shall eat the flesh of the mighty and you shall drink the
blood of the princes of the earth of rams and of lambs and of he
goats and bullocks and of all that are well fed and fat

3919 And you shall eat the fat till you be full and shall drink
blood till you be drunk of the victim which I shall slay for you

3920 And you shall be filled at my table with horses and mighty
horsemen and all the men of war saith the Lord God

3921 And I will set my glory among the nations and all nations shall
see my judgment that I have executed and my hand that I have laid upon
them

3922 And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God
from that day and forward

3923 And the nations shall know that the house of Israel were made
captives for their iniquity because they forsook me and I hid my face
from them and I delivered them into the hands of their enemies and
they fell all by the sword

3924 I have dealt with them according to their uncleanness and
wickedness and hid my face from them

3925 Therefore thus saith the Lord God Now will I bring back the
captivity of Jacob and will have mercy on all the house of Israel and
I will be jealous for my holy name

3926 And they shall bear their confusion and all the transgressions
wherewith they have transgressed against me when they shall dwell in
their land securely fearing no man

3927 And I shall have brought them back from among the nations and
shall have gathered them together out of the lands of their enemies
and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of many nations

3928 And they shall know that I am the Lord their God because I
caused them to be carried away among the nations and I have gathered
them together unto their own land and have not left any of them there

3929 And I will hide my face no more from them for I have poured out
my spirit upon all the house of Israel saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 40


The prophet sees in a vision the rebuilding of the temple the
dimensions of several parts thereof

401 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity in the beginning
of the year the tenth day of the month the fourteenth year after the
city was destroyed in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon
me and he brought me thither

402 In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel and
set me upon a very high mountain upon which there was as the building
of a city bending towards the south

403 And he brought me in thither and behold a man whose appearance
was like the appearance of brass with a line of flax in his hand and
a measuring reed in his hand and he stood in the gate

404 And this man said to me Son of man see with thy eyes and hear
with thy ears and set thy heart upon all that I shall shew thee for
thou art brought hither that they may be shewn to thee declare all
that thou seest to the house of Israel

405 And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house round
about and in the mans hand a measuring reed of six cubits and a
handbreadth and he measured the breadth of the building one reed and
the height one reed

406 And he came to the gate that looked toward the east and he went
up the steps thereof and he measured the breadth of the threshold of
the gate one reed that is one threshold was one reed broad

thereof two cubits and the porch of the gate was inward

cubits on this side and that side

4013 And he measured the gate from the roof of one little chamber to
the roof of another in breadth five and twenty cubits door against

4014 He made also fronts of sixty cubits and to the front the court
of the gate on every side round about

4015 And before the face of the gate which reached even to the face
of the porch of the inner gate fifty cubits

4016 And slanting windows in the little chambers and in their
fronts which were within the gate on every side round about and in
like manner there were also in the porches windows round about within
and before the fronts the representation of palm trees

4017 And he brought me into the outward court and behold there were
chambers and a pavement of stone in the court round about thirty
chambers encompassed the pavement

There were chambers  Gazophylacia so called because the priests and
Levites kept in them the stores and vessels that belonged to the
temple

4018 And the pavement in the front of the gates according to the
length of the gates was lower

4019 And he measured the breadth from the face of the lower gate to
the front of the inner court without a hundred cubits to the east and
to the north

4020 He measured also both the length and the breadth of the gate of
the outward court which looked northward

4021 And the little chambers thereof three on this side and three on
that side and the front thereof and the porch thereof according to
the measure of the former gate fifty cubits long and five and twenty
cubits broad

went up to it by seven steps and a porch was before it

4023 And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate of the
north and that of the east and he measured from gate to gate a
hundred cubits

4024 And he brought me out to the way of the south and behold the
gate that looked to the south and he measured the front thereof and
the porch thereof according to the former measures

side and the going up to it was by eight steps

4038 And at every chamber was a door in the forefronts of the gates
there they washed the holocaust

4039 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and
two tables on that side that the holocaust and the sin offering and
the trespass offering might be slain thereon

4040 And on the outward side which goeth up to the entry of the gate
that looketh toward the north were two tables and at the other side
before the porch of the gate were two tables

4041 Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side at
the sides of the gate were eight tables upon which they slew the
victims

4042 And the four tables for the holocausts were made of square
stones one cubit and a half long and one cubit and a half broad and
one cubit high to lay the vessels upon in which the holocaust and the
victim is slain

4043 And the borders of them were of one handbreadth turned inwards
round about and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering

4044 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singing men
in the inner court which was on the side of the gate that looketh to
the north and their prospect was towards the south one at the side of
the east gate which looketh toward the north

4045 And he said to me This chamber which looketh toward the south
shall be for the priests that watch in the wards of the temple

4046 But the chamber that looketh towards the north shall be for the
priests that watch over the ministry of the altar These are the sons
of Sadoc who among the sons of Levi come near to the Lord to
minister to him

4047 And he measured the court a hundred cubits long and a hundred
cubits broad foursquare and the altar that was before the face of the
temple

4048 And he brought me into the porch of the temple and he measured
the porch five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side and
the breadth of the gate three cubits on this side and three cubits on
that side

4049 And the length of the porch was twenty cubits and the breadth
eleven cubits and there were eight steps to go up to it And there
were pillars in the fronts one on this side and another on that side



Ezechiel Chapter 41


A description of the temple and of all the parts of it

411 And he brought me into the temple and he measured the fronts six
cubits broad on this side and six cubits on that side the breadth of
the tabernacle

The temple  This plan of a temple which was here shewn to the
prophet in a vision partly had relation to the material temple which
was to be rebuilt and partly in a mystical sense to the spiritual
temple of God the church of Christ

412 And the breadth of the gate was ten cubits and the sides of the
gate five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side and he
measured the length thereof forty cubits and the breadth twenty
cubits

413 Then going inward he measured the front of the gate two cubits
and the gate six cubits and the breadth of the gate seven cubits

414 And he measured the length thereof twenty cubits and the breadth
twenty cubits before the face of the temple and he said to me This
is the holy of holies

415 And he measured the wall of the house six cubits and the breadth
of every side chamber four cubits round about the house on every side

416 And the side chambers one by another were twice thirtythree
and they bore outwards that they might enter in through the wall of
the house in the sides round about to hold in and not to touch the
wall of the temple

One by another  Or one over another literally side to side or side
upon side

417 And there was a broad passage round about going up by winding
stairs and it led into the upper loft of the temple all round
therefore was the temple broader in the higher parts and so from the
lower parts they went to the higher by the midst

418 And I saw in the house the height round about the foundations of
the side chambers which were the measure of a reed the space of six
cubits

419 And the thickness of the wall for the side chamber without which
was five cubits and the inner house was within the side chambers of
the house

And the inner house was within the side chambers of the
house  Because these side chambers were in the very walls of the
temple all round Or it may also be rendered more agreeably to the
Hebrew so as to signify that the thickness of the wall for the side
chamber within was the same as that of the wall without that is
equally five cubits

4110 And between the chambers was the breadth of twenty cubits round
about the house on every side

4111 And the door of the side chambers was turned towards the place
of prayer one door was toward the north and another door was toward
the south and the breadth of the place for prayer was five cubits
round about

4112 And the building that was separate and turned to the way that
looked toward the sea was seventy cubits broad and the wall of the
building five cubits thick round about and ninety cubits long

4113 And he measured the length of the house a hundred cubits and
the separate building and the walls thereof a hundred cubits in
length

4114 And the breadth before the face of the house and of the
separate place toward the east a hundred cubits

4115 And he measured the length of the building over against it
which was separated at the back of it and the galleries on both sides
a hundred cubits and the inner temple and the porches of the court

4116 The thresholds and the oblique windows and the galleries round
about on three sides over against the threshold of every one and
floored with wood all round about and the ground was up to the
windows and the windows were shut over the doors

4117 And even to the inner house and without all the wall round
about within and without by measure

4118 And there were cherubims and palm trees wrought so that a palm
tree was between a cherub and a cherub and every cherub had two faces

4119 The face of a man was toward the palm tree on one side and the
face of a lion was toward the palm tree on the other side set forth
through all the house round about

4120 From the ground even to the upper parts of the gate were
cherubims and palm trees wrought in the wall of the temple

4121 The threshold was foursquare and the face of the sanctuary
sight to sight

The threshold was foursquare  That is the gate of the temple was
foursquare and so placed as to answer the gate of the sanctuary
within

4122 The altar of wood was three cubits high and the length thereof
was two cubits and the corners thereof aid the length thereof and
the walls thereof were of wood And he said to me This is the table
before the Lord

4123 And there were two doors in the temple and in the sanctuary

4124 And in the two doors on both sides were two little doors which
were folded within each other for there were two wickets on both sides
of the doors

4125 And there were cherubims also wrought in the doors of the
temple and the figures of palm trees like as were made on the walls
for which cause also the planks were thicker in the front of the porch
without

4126 Upon which were the oblique windows and the representation of
palm trees on this side and on that side in the sides of the porch
according to the sides of the house and the breadth of the walls



Ezechiel Chapter 42


A description of the courts chambers and other places belonging to
the temple

421 And he brought me forth into the outward court by the way that
leadeth to the north and he brought me into the chamber that was over
against the separate building and over against the house toward the
north

422 In the face of the north door was the length of hundred cubits
and the breadth of fifty cubits

423 Over against the twenty cubits of the inner court and over
against the pavement of the outward court that was paved with stone
where there was a gallery joined to a triple gallery

424 And before the chambers was a walk ten cubits broad looking to
the inner parts of a way of one cubit And their doors were toward the
north

425 Where were the store chambers lower above because they bore up
the galleries which appeared above out of them from he lower parts
and from the midst of the building

426 For they were of three stories and had not pillars as the
pillars of the courts therefore did they appear above out of the lower
places and out of the middle places fifty cubits from the ground

427 And the outward wall that went about by the chambers which were
towards the outward court on the forepart of the chambers was fifty
cubits long

428 For the length of the chambers of the outward court was fifty
cubits and the length before the face of the temple a hundred cubits

429 And there was under these chambers an entrance from the east
for them that went into them out of the outward court

4210 In the breadth of the outward wall of the court that was toward
the east over against the separate building and there were chambers
before the building

4211 And the way before them was like the chambers which were toward
the north they were as long as they and as broad as they and all the
going in to them and their fashions and their doors were alike

4212 According to the doors of the chambers that were towards the
south there was a door in the head of the way which way was before
the porch separated towards the east as one entereth in

4213 And he said to me The chambers of the north and the chambers
of the south which are before the separate building they are holy
chambers in which the priests shall eat that approach to the Lord
into the holy of holies there they shall lay the most holy things and
the offering for sin and for trespass for it is a holy place

4214 And when the priests shall have entered in they shall not go
out of the holy places into the outward court but there they shall lay
their vestments wherein they minister for they are holy and they
shall put on other garments and so they shall go forth to the people

4215 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house he
brought me out by the way of the gate that looked toward the east and
he measured it on every side round about

4216 And he measured toward the east with the measuring reed five
hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about

4217 And he measured toward the north five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed round about

4218 And towards the south he measured five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed round about

4219 And toward the west he measured five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed

4220 By the four winds he measured the wall thereof on every side
round about five hundred cubits and five hundred cubits broad making
a separation between the sanctuary and the place of the people



Ezechiel Chapter 43


The glory of God returns to the new temple The Israelites shall no
more profane Gods name by idolatry the prophet is commanded to shew
them the dimensions and form of the temple and of the altar with the
sacrifices to be offered thereon

431 And he brought me to the gate that looked towards the east

432 And behold the glory of the God of Israel came in by the way of
the east and his voice was like the noise of many waters and the
earth shone with his majesty

433 And I saw the vision according to the appearance which I had seen
when he came to destroy the city and the appearance was according to
the vision which I had seen by the river Chobar and I fell upon my
face

434 And the majesty of the Lord went into the temple by the way of
the gate that looked to the east

435 And the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court
and behold the house was filled with the glory of the Lord

436 And I heard one speaking to me out of the house and the man that
stood by me

437 Said to me Son of man the place of my throne and the place of
the soles of my feet where I dwell in the midst of the children of
Israel for ever and the house of Israel shall no more profane my holy
name they and their kings by their fornications and by the carcasses
of their kings and by the high places

438 They who have set their threshold by my threshold and their
posts by my posts and there was but a wall between me and them and
they profaned my holy name by the abominations which they committed
for which reason I consumed them in my wrath

439 Now therefore let them put away their fornications and the
carcasses of their kings far from me and I will dwell in the midst of
them for ever

4310 But thou son of man shew to the house of Israel the temple
and let them be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the
building

4311 And be ashamed of all that they have done Shew them the form of
the house and of the fashion thereof the goings out and the comings
in and the whole plan thereof and all its ordinances and all its
order and all its laws and thou shalt write it in their sight that
they may keep the whole form thereof and its ordinances and do them

4312 This is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain All
its border round about most holy this then is the law of the house

4313 And these are the measures of the altar by the truest cubit
which is a cubit and a handbreadth the bottom thereof was a cubit and
the breadth a cubit and the border thereof unto its edge and round
about one handbreadth and this was the trench of the altar

4314 And from the bottom of the ground to the lowest brim two cubits
and the breadth of one cubit and from the lesser brim to the greater
brim four cubits and the breadth of one cubit

4315 And the Ariel itself was four cubits and from the Ariel upward
were four horns

The Ariel  That is the altar itself or rather the highest part of
it upon which the burnt offerings were laid In the Hebrew it is
Harel that is the mountain of God but in the following verse
Haariel that is the lion of God a figure from its consuming and as
it were devouring the sacrifices as a lion devours its prey

4316 And the Ariel was twelve cubits long and twelve cubits broad
foursquare with equal sides

4317 And the brim was fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits broad
in the four corners thereof and the crown round about it was half a
cubit and the bottom of it one cubit round about and its steps turned
toward the east

4318 And he said to me Son of man thus saith the Lord God These
are the ceremonies of the altar in what day soever it shall be made
that holocausts may be offered upon it and blood poured out

4319 And thou shalt give to the priests and the Levites that are of
the race of Sadoc who approach to me saith the Lord God to offer to
me a calf of the herd for sin

4320 And thou shalt take of his blood and shalt put it upon the four
horns thereof and upon the four corners of the brim and upon the
crown round about and thou shalt cleanse and expiate it

4321 And thou shalt take the calf that is offered for sin and thou
shalt burn him in a separate place of the house without the sanctuary

4322 And in the second day thou shalt offer a he goat without blemish
for sin and they shall expiate the altar as they expiated it with the
calf

4323 And when thou shalt have made an end of the expiation thereof
thou shalt offer a calf of the herd without blemish and a ram of the
flock without blemish

4324 And thou shalt offer them in the sight of the Lord and the
priests shall put salt upon them and shall offer them a holocaust to
the Lord

4325 Seven days shalt thou offer a he goat for sin daily they shall
offer also a calf of the herd and a ram of the flock without blemish

4326 Seven days shall they expiate the altar and shall cleanse it
and they shall consecrate it

Consecrate it  Literally fill its hand that is dedicate and apply
it to holy service

4327 And the days being expired on the eighth day and thenceforward
the priests shall offer your holocausts upon the altar and the peace
offerings and I will be pacified towards you saith the Lord God



Ezechiel Chapter 44


The east gate of the sanctuary shall be always shut The uncircumcised
shall not enter into the sanctuary nor the Levites that have served
idols but the sons of Sadoc shall do the priestly functions who stood
firm in the worst of times

441 And he brought me back to the way of the gate of the outward
sanctuary which looked towards the east and it was shut

442 And the Lord said to me This gate shall be shut it shall not be
opened and no man shall pass through it because the Lord the God of
Israel hath entered in by it and it shall be shut

443 For the prince The prince himself shall sit in it to eat bread
before the Lord he shall enter in by the way of the porch of the gate
and shall go out by the same way

444 And he brought me by the way of the north gate in the sight of
the house and I saw and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house
of the Lord and I fell on my face

445 And the Lord said to me Son of man attend with thy heart and
behold with thy eyes and hear with thy ears all that I say to thee
concerning all the ceremonies of the house of the Lord and concerning
all the laws thereof and mark well the ways of the temple with all
the goings out of the sanctuary

446 And thou shalt say to the house of Israel that provoketh me Thus
saith the Lord God Let all your wicked doings suffice you O house of
Israel

447 In that you have brought in strangers uncircumcised in heart and
uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary and to defile my house
and you offer my bread the fat and the blood and you have broken my
covenant by all your wicked doings

448 And you have not kept the ordinances of my sanctuary but you
have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves

449 Thus saith the Lord God No stranger uncircumcised in heart and
uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary no stranger that
is in the midst of the children of Israel

4410 Moreover the Levites that went away far from me when the
children of Israel went astray and have wandered from me after their
idols and have borne their iniquity

4411 They shall be officers in my sanctuary and doorkeepers of the
gates of the house and ministers to the house they shall slay the
holocausts and the victims of the people and they shall stand in
their sight to minister to them

4412 Because they ministered to them before their idols and were a
stumblingblock of iniquity to the house of Israel therefore have I
lifted up my hand against them saith the Lord God and they shall bear
their iniquity

4413 And they shall not come near to me to do the office of priest
to me neither shall they come near to any of my holy things that are
by the holy of holies but they shall bear their shame and their
wickednesses which they have committed

4414 And I will make them doorkeepers of the house for all the
service thereof and for all that shall be done therein

4415 But the priests and Levites the sons of Sadoc who kept the
ceremonies of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray
from me they shall come near to me to minister to me and they shall
stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood saith the Lord
God

4416 They shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to
my table to minister unto me and to keep my ceremonies

4417 And when they shall enter in at the gates of the inner court
they shall be clothed with linen garments neither shall any woollen
come upon them when they minister in the gates of the inner court and
within

4418 They shall have linen mitres on their heads and linen breeches
on their loins and they shall not be girded with any thing that
causeth sweat

4419 And when they shall go forth to the outward court to the people
they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered and lay them
up in the store chamber of the sanctuary and they shall clothe
themselves with other garments and they shall not sanctify the people
with their vestments

Shall not sanctify the people with their vestments  By exposing them
to the danger of touching the sacred vestments which none were to
touch but they that were sanctified

4420 Neither shall they shave their heads nor wear long hair but
they shall only poll their heads

4421 And no priest shall drink wine when he is to go into the inner
court

4422 Neither shall they take to wife a widow nor one that is
divorced but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of
Israel but they may take a widow also that is the widow of a priest

4423 And they shall teach my people the difference between holy and
profane and shew them how to discern between clean and unclean

4424 And when there shall be a controversy they shall stand in my
judgments and shall judge they shall keep my laws and my ordinances
in all my solemnities and sanctify my sabbaths

4425 And they shall come near no dead person lest they be defiled
only their father and mother and son and daughter and brother and
sister that hath not had another husband for whom they may become
unclean

4426 And after one is cleansed they shall reckon unto him seven
days

4427 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary to the inner
court to minister unto me in the sanctuary he shall offer for his
sin saith the Lord God

4428 And they shall have no inheritance I am their inheritance
neither shall you give them any possession in Israel for I am their
possession

4429 They shall eat the victim both for sin and for trespass and
every vowed thing in Israel shall be theirs

30 And the firstfruits of all the firstborn and all the libations of
all things that are offered shall be the priests and you shall give
the firstfruits of your meats to the priest that he may return a
blessing upon thy house

4431 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself or
caught by a beast whether it be fowl or cattle



Ezechiel Chapter 45


Portions of land for the sanctuary for the city and for the prince
Ordinances for the prince

451 And when you shall begin to divide the land by lot separate ye
firstfruits to the Lord a portion of the land to be holy in length

all the borders thereof round about

Twentyfive thousand  Viz reeds or cubits

452 And there shall be for the sanctuary on every side five hundred
by five hundred foursquare round about and fifty cubits for the
suburbs thereof round about

453 And with this measure thou shalt measure the length of five and
twenty thousand and the breadth of ten thousand and in it shall be

454 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
ministers of the sanctuary who come near to the ministry of the Lord

sanctuary

455 And five and twenty thousand of length and ten thousand of

457 For the prince also on the one side and on the other side
according to the separation of the sanctuary and according to the
possession of the city over against the separation of the sanctuary
and over against the possession of the city from the side of the sea
even to the sea and from the side of the east even to the east And
the length according to every part from the west border to the east

458 He shall have a portion of the land in Israel and the princes
shall no more rob my people but they shall give the land to the house
of Israel according to their tribes

459 Thus saith the Lord God Let it suffice you O princes of Israel
cease from iniquity and robberies and execute judgment and justice
separate your confines from my people saith the Lord God

4510 You shall have just balances and a just ephi and a just bate

4511 The ephi and the bate shall be equal and of one measure that
the bate may contain the tenth part of a core and the ephi the tenth
part of a core their weight shall be equal according to the measure of
a core

The ephi and the bate  These measures were of equal capacity but the
bate served for liquids and the ephi for dry things

4512 And the sicle hath twenty obols Now twenty sicles and five and
twenty sicles and fifteen sicles make a mna

4513 And these are the firstfruits which you shall take the sixth
part of an ephi of a core of wheat and the sixth part of an ephi of a
core of barley

4514 The measure of oil also a bate of oil is the tenth part of a
core and ten bates make a core for ten bates fill a core

4515 And one ram out of a flock of two hundred of those that Israel
feedeth for sacrifice and for holocausts and for peace offerings to
make atonement for them saith the Lord God

4516 All the people of the land shall be bound to these firstfruits
for the prince in Israel

4517 And the prince shall give the holocaust and the sacrifice and
the libations on the feasts and on the new moons and on the sabbaths
and on all the solemnities of the house of Israel he shall offer the
sacrifice for sin and the holocaust and the peace offerings to make
expiation for the house of Israel

4518 Thus saith the Lord God In the first month the first of the
month thou shalt take a calf of the herd without blemish and thou
shalt expiate the sanctuary

4519 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering and
he shall put it on the posts of the house and on the four corners of
the brim of the altar and oil the posts of the gate of the inner
court

4520 And so shalt thou do in the seventh day of the month for every
one that hath been ignorant and hath been deceived by error and thou
shalt make expiation for the house

4521 In the first month the fourteenth day of the month you shall
observe the solemnity of the pasch seven days unleavened bread shall
be eaten

4522 And the prince on that day shall offer for himself and for all
the people of the land a calf for sin

4523 And in the solemnity of the seven days he shall offer for a
holocaust to the Lord seven calves and seven rams without blemish

Ezechiel Chapter 46


Other ordinances for the prince and for the sacrifices

461 Thus saith the Lord God The gate of the inner court that looketh
toward the east shall be shut the six days on which work is done but
on the sabbath day it shall be opened yea and on the day of the new
moon it shall be opened

462 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate
from without and he shall stand at the threshold of the gate and the
priests shall offer his holocaust and his peace offerings and he
shall adore upon the threshold of the gate and shall go out but the
gate shall not be shut till the evening

463 And the people of the land shall adore at the door of that gate
before the Lord on the sabbaths and on the new moons

464 And the holocaust that the prince shall offer to the Lord on the
sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without
blemish

465 And the sacrifice of all ephi for a ram but for the lambs what
sacrifice his hand shall allow and a hin of oil for every ephi

466 And on the day of the new moon a calf of the herd without
blemish and the six lambs and the rams shall be without blemish

467 And he shall offer in sacrifice an ephi for calf an ephi also
for a ram but for the lambs as his hand shall find and a hin of oil
for every ephi

468 And when the prince is to go in let him go in by the way of the
porch of the gate and let him go out the same way

469 But when the people of the land shall go in before the Lord in
the solemn feasts he that goeth in by the north gate to adore shall
go out by the way of the south gate and he that goeth in by the way of
the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate he shall not
return by the way of the gate whereby he came in but shall go out at
that over against it

4610 And the prince in the midst of them shall go in when they go
in and go out when they go out

4611 And in the fairs and in the solemnities there shall be the
sacrifice of an ephi to a calf and an ephi to a ram and to the lambs

east shall be opened to him and he shall offer his holocaust and his
peace offerings as it is wont to be done on the sabbath day and he
shall go out and the gate shall be shut after he is gone forth

4613 And he shall offer every day for a holocaust to the Lord a lamb
of the same year without blemish he shall offer it always in the
morning

4614 And he shall offer the sacrifice for it morning by morning the
sixth part of an ephi and the third part of a hin of oil to be mingled
with the fine flour a sacrifice to the Lord by ordinance continual and
everlasting

4615 He shall offer the lamb and the sacrifice and the oil morning
by morning an everlasting holocaust

4616 Thus saith the Lord God If the prince give a gift to any of his
sons the inheritance of it shall go to his children they shall
possess it by inheritance

4617 But if he give a legacy out of his inheritance to one of his
servants it shall be his until the year of release and it shall
return to the prince but his inheritance shall go to his sons

4618 And the prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance by
violence nor of their possession but out of his own possession he
shall give an inheritance to his sons that my people be not dispersed
every man from his possession

4619 And he brought me in by the entry that was at the side of the
gate into the chambers of the sanctuary that were for the priests
which looked toward the north And there was a place bending to the
west

4620 And he said to me This is the place where the priests shall
boil the sin offering and the trespass offering where they shall
dress the sacrifice that they may not bring it out into the outward
court and the people be sanctified

4621 And he brought me into the outward court and he led me about by
the four corners of the court and behold there was a little court in
the corner of the court to every corner of the court there was a
little court

4622 In the four corners of the court were little courts disposed
forty cubits long and thirty broad all the four were of one measure

4623 And there was a wall round about compassing the four little
courts and there were kitchens built under the rows round about

4624 And he said to me This is the house of the kitchens wherein the
ministers of the house of the Lord shall boil the victims of the
people



Ezechiel Chapter 47


The vision of the holy waters issuing out from under the temple the
borders of the land to be divided among the twelve tribes

471 And he brought me again to the gate of the house and behold
waters issued out from under the threshold of the house toward the
east for the forefront of the house looked toward the east but the
waters came down to the right side of the temple to the south part of
the altar

Waters  These waters are not to be understood literally for there
were none such that flowed from the temple but mystically of the
baptism of Christ and of his doctrine and his grace the trees that
grow on the banks are Christian virtues the fishes are Christians
that spiritually live in and by these holy waters the fishermen are
the apostles and apostolic preachers the fenny places where there is
no health are such as by being out of the church are separated from
these waters of life

472 And he led me out by the way of the north gate and he caused me
to turn to the way without the outward gate to the way that looked
toward the east and behold there ran out waters on the right side

473 And when the man that had the line in his hand went out towards
the east he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the
water up to the ankles

474 And again he measured a thousand and he brought me through the
water up to the knees

475 And he measured a thousand and he brought me through the water
up to the loins And he measured a thousand and it was a torrent
which I could not pass over for the waters were risen so as to make a
deep torrent which could not be passed over

476 And he said to me Surely thou hast seen O son of man And he
brought me out and he caused me to turn to the bank of the torrent

477 And when I had turned myself behold on the bank of the torrent
were very many trees on both sides

478 And he said to me These waters that issue forth toward the
hillocks of sand to the east and go down to the plains of the desert
shall go into the sea and shall go out and the waters shall be
healed

479 And every living creature that creepeth whithersoever the torrent
shall come shall live and there shall be fishes in abundance after
these waters shall come thither and they shall be healed and all
things shall live to which the torrent shall come

4710 And the fishers shall stand over these waters from Engaddi even
to Engallim there shall be drying of nets there shall be many sorts of
the fishes thereof as the fishes of the great sea a very great
multitude

4711 But on the shore thereof and in the fenny places they shall not
be healed because they shall be turned into saltpits

4712 And by the torrent on the banks thereof on both sides shall grow
all trees that bear fruit their leaf shall not fall off and their
fruit shall not fail every month shall they bring forth firstfruits
because the waters thereof shall issue out of the sanctuary and the
fruits thereof shall be for food and the leaves thereof for medicine

4713 Thus saith the Lord God This is the border by which you shall
possess the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel for Joseph
hath a double portion

4714 And you shall possess it every man in like manner as his
brother concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to your
fathers and this land shall fall unto you for a possession

4715 And this is the border of the land toward the north side from
the great sea by the way of Hethalon as men go to Sedada

4716 Emath Berotha Sabarim which is between the border of Damascus
and the border of Emath the house of Tichon which is by the border of
Auran

4717 And the border from the sea even to the court of Enan shall be
the border of Damascus and from the north to the north the border of
Emath this is the north side

4718 And the east side is from the midst of Auran and from the midst
of Damascus and from the midst of Galaad and from the midst of the
land of Israel Jordan making the bound to the east sea and thus you
shall measure the east side

4719 And the south side southward is from Thamar even to the waters
of contradiction of Cades and the torrent even to the great sea and
this is the south side southward

4720 And the side toward the sea is the great sea from the borders
straight on till thou come to Emath this is the side of the sea

4721 And you shall divide this land unto you by the tribes of Israel

4722 And you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you and to
the strangers that shall come over to you that shall beget children
among you and they shall be unto you as men of the same country born
among the children of Israel they shall divide the possession with you
in the midst of the tribes of Israel

4723 And in what tribe soever the stranger shall be there shall you
give him possession saith the Lord God

THE PROPHECY OF DANIEL



DANIEL whose name signifies THE JUDGMENT OF GOD was of the royal
blood of the kings of Juda and one of those that were first of all
carried away into captivity He was so renowned for wisdom and
knowledge that it became a proverb among the Babylonians AS WISE AS
DANIEL Ezech 283 And his holiness was so great from his very
childhood that at the time when he was as yet but a young man he is
joined by the SPIRIT of GOD with NOE and JOB as three persons most
eminent for virtue and sanctity Ezech 14 He is not commonly numbered
by the Hebrews among THE PROPHETS because he lived at court and in
high station in the world but if we consider his many clear
predictions of things to come we shall find that no one better
deserves the name and title of A PROPHET which also has been given him
by the SON of GOD himself Matt 24 Mark 13 Luke 21



Daniel Chapter 1


Daniel and his companions are taken into the palace of the king of
Babylon they abstain from his meat and wine and succeed better with
pulse and water Their excellence and wisdom

11 In the third year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and beseiged it

12 And the Lord delivered into his hands Joakim the king of Juda
and part of the vessels of the house of God and he carried them away
into the land of Sennaar to the house of his god and the vessels he
brought into the treasure house of his god

His god  Bel or Belus the principal idol of the Chaldeans

13 And the king spoke to Asphenez the master of the eunuchs that he
should bring in some of the children of Israel and of the kings seed
and of the princes

14 Children in whom there was no blemish well favoured and skilful
in all wisdom acute in knowledge and instructed in science and such
as might stand in the kings palace that he might teach them the
learning and tongue of the Chaldeans

15 And the king appointed them a daily provision of his own meat
and of the wine of which he drank himself that being nourished three
years afterwards they might stand before the king

16 Now there was among them of the children of Juda Daniel Ananias
Misael and Azarias

17 And the master of the eunuchs gave them names to Daniel
Baltassar to Ananias Sidrach to Misael Misach and to Azarias
Abdenago

18 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled with
the kings table nor with the wine which he drank and he requested
the master of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled

Be defiled etc  Viz either by eating meat forbidden by the law or
which had before been offered to idols

19 And God gave to Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the prince
of the eunuchs

110 And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel I fear my lord the
king who hath appointed you meat and drink who if he should see your
faces leaner than those of the other youths your equals you shall
endanger my head to the king

111 And Daniel said to Malasar whom the prince of the eunuchs had
appointed over Daniel Ananias Misael and Azarias

112 Try I beseech thee thy servants for ten days and let pulse be
given us to eat and water to drink

Pulse  That is pease beans and such like

113 And look upon our faces and the faces of the children that eat
of the kings meat and as thou shalt see deal with thy servants

114 And when he had heard these words he tried them for ten days

115 And after ten days their faces appeared fairer and fatter than
all the children that ate of the kings meat

116 So Malasar took their portions and the wine that they should
drink and he gave them pulse

117 And to these children God gave knowledge and understanding in
every book and wisdom but to Daniel the understanding also of all
visions and dreams

118 And when the days were ended after which the king had ordered
they should be brought in the prince of the eunuchs brought them in
before Nabuchodonosor

119 And when the king had spoken to them there were not found among
them all such as Daniel Ananias Misael and Azarias and they stood
in the kings presence

120 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king
enquired of them he found them ten times better than all the diviners
and wise men that were in all his kingdom

121 And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus



Daniel Chapter 2


Daniel by divine revelation declares the dream of Nabuchodonosor and
the interpretation of it He is highly honoured by the king

21 In the second year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor Nabuchodonosor
had a dream and his spirit was terrified and his dream went out of
his mind

The second year  Viz from the death of his father Nabopolassar for
he had reigned before as partner with his father in the empire

22 Then the king commanded to call together the diviners and the wise
men and the magicians and the Chaldeans to declare to the king his
dreams so they came and stood before the king

The Chaldeeans  That is the astrologers that pretended to divine by
stars

23 And the king said to them I saw a dream and being troubled in
mind I know not what I saw

24 And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac O king live for
ever tell to thy servants thy dream and we will declare the
interpretation thereof

25 And the king answering said to the Chaldeans The thing is gone
out of my mind unless you tell me the dream and the meaning thereof
you shall be put to death and your houses shall be confiscated

26 but if you tell the dream and the meaning of it you shall
receive of me rewards and gifts and great honour therefore tell me
the dream and the interpretation thereof

27 They answered again and said Let the king tell his servants the
dream and we will declare the interpretation of it

28 The king answered and said I know for certain that you seek to
gain time since you know that the thing is gone from me

29 If therefore you tell me not the dream there is one sentence
concerning you that you have also framed a lying interpretation and
full of deceit to speak before me till the time pass away Tell me
therefore the dream that I may know that you also give a true
interpretation thereof

210 Then the Chaldeans answered before the king and said There is
no man upon earth that can accomplish thy word O king neither doth
any king though great and mighty ask such a thing of any diviner or
wise man or Chaldean

211 For the thing that thou asketh O king is difficult nor can any
one be found that can shew it before the king except the gods whose
conversation is not with men

212 Upon hearing this the king in fury and in great wrath
commanded that all the wise men of Babylon should be put to death

213 And the decree being gone forth the wise men were slain and
Daniel and his companions were sought for to be put to death

214 Then Daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence of
Arioch the general of the kings army who was gone forth to kill the
wise men of Babylon

215 And he asked him that had received the orders of the king why so
cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king And when
Arioch had told the matter to Daniel

216 Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him
time to resolve the question and declare it to the king

217 And he went into his house and told the matter to Ananias and
Misael and Azarias his companions

218 To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the God of
heaven concerning this secret and that Daniel and his companions
might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon

219 Then was the mystery revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night
and Daniel blessed the God of heaven

220 And speaking he said Blessed be the name of the Lord from
eternity and for evermore for wisdom and fortitude are his

221 And he changeth times and ages taketh away kingdoms and
establisheth them giveth wisdom to the wise and knowledge to them
that have understanding

222 He revealeth deep and hidden things and knoweth what is in
darkness and light is with him

223 To thee O God of our fathers I give thanks and I praise thee
because thou hast given me wisdom and strength and now thou hast shewn
me what we desired of thee for thou hast made known to us the kings
discourse

224 After this Daniel went in to Arioch to whom the king had given
orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon and he spoke thus to him
Destroy not the wise men of Babylon bring me in before the king and I
will tell the solution to the king

225 Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king and said to
him I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda that
will resolve the question to the king

226 The king answered and said to Daniel whose name was Baltassar
Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw and
the interpretation thereof

227 And Daniel made answer before the king and said The secret that
the king desireth to know none of the wise men or the philosophers
or the diviners or the soothsayers can declare to the king

228 But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries who hath
shewn to thee O king Nabuchodonosor what is to come to pass in the
latter times Thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are
these

229 Thou O king didst begin to think in thy bed what should come
to pass hereafter and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what
shall come to pass

230 To me also this secret is revealed not by any wisdom that I have
more than all men alive but that the interpretation might be made
manifest to the king and thou mightest know the thought of thy mind

231 Thou O king sawest and behold there was as it were a great
statue this statue which was great and high tall of stature stood
before thee and the look thereof was terrible

232 The head of this statue was of fine gold but the breast and the
arms of silver and the belly and the thighs of brass

233 And the legs of iron the feet part of iron and part of clay

234 Thus thou sawest till a stone was cut out of a mountain without
hands and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron
and clay and broke them in pieces

235 Then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold
broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of a summers
threshing floor and they were carried away by the wind and there was
no place found for them but the stone that struck the statue became a
great mountain and filled the whole earth

236 This is the dream we will also tell the interpretation thereof
before thee O king

237 Thou art a king of kings and the God of heaven hath given thee a
kingdom and strength and power and glory

238 And all places wherein the children of men and the beasts of the
field do dwell he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand
and hath put all things under thy power thou therefore art the head
of gold

239 And after thee shall rise up another kingdom inferior to thee
of silver and another third kingdom of brass which shall rule over
all the world

Another kingdom  Viz that of the Medes and Persians Ibid Third
kingdom  Viz that of Alexander the Great

240 And the fourth kingdom shall be as iron As iron breaketh into
pieces and subdueth all things so shall that break and destroy all
these

The fourth kingdom etc  Some understand this of the successors of
Alexander the kings of Syria and Egypt others of the Roman empire
and its civil wars

241 And whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes part of potters
clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but yet it shall
take its origin from the iron according as thou sawest the iron mixed
with the miry clay

242 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay
the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken

243 And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay they shall
be mingled indeed together with the seed of man but they shall not
stick fast one to another as iron cannot be mixed with clay

244 But in the days of those kingdoms the God of heaven will set up
a kingdom that shall never by destroyed and his kingdom shall not be
delivered up to another people and it shall break in pieces and shall
consume all these kingdoms and itself shall stand for ever

A kingdom  Viz the kingdom of Christ in the Catholic Church which
cannot be destroyed

245 According as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
mountain without hands and broke in pieces the clay and the iron and
the brass and the silver and the gold the great God hath shewn the
king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is true and the
interpretation thereof is faithful

246 Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face and worshipped Daniel
and commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and
incense

247 And the king spoke to Daniel and said Verily your God is the
God of gods and Lord of kings and a revealer of hidden things seeing
thou couldst discover this secret

248 Then the king advanced Daniel to a high station and gave him
many and great gifts and he made him governor over all the provinces
of Babylon and chief of the magistrates over all the wise men of
Babylon

249 And Daniel requested of the king and he appointed Sidrach
Misach and Abdenago over the works of the province of Babylon but
Daniel himself was in the kings palace



Daniel Chapter 3


Nabuchodonosor set up a golden statue which he commands all to adore
the three children for refusing to do it are cast into the fiery
furnace but are not hurt by the flames Their prayer and canticle of
praise

31 King Nabuchodonosor made a statue of gold of sixty cubits high
and six cubits broad and he set it up in the plain of Dura of the
province of Babylon

32 Then Nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles
the magistrates and the judges the captains the rulers and
governors and all the chief men of the provinces to come to the
dedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up

33 Then the nobles the magistrates and the judges the captains
and rulers and the great men that were placed in authority and all
the princes of the provinces were gathered together to come to the
dedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up And
they stood before the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up

34 Then a herald cried with a strong voice To you it is commanded O
nations tribes and languages

35 That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet and
of the flute and of the harp of the sackbut and of the psaltery and
of the symphony and of all kind of music ye fall down and adore the
golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor hath set up

36 But if any man shall not fall down and adore he shall the same
hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire

37 Upon this therefore at the time when all the people heard the
sound of the trumpet the flute and the harp of the sackbut and the
psaltery of the symphony and of all kind of music all the nations
tribes and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king
Nabuchodonosor had set up

38 And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused
the Jews

39 And said to king Nabuchodonosor O king live for ever

310 Thou O king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear
the sound of the trumpet the flute and the harp of the sackbut and
the psaltery of the symphony and of all kind of music shall
prostrate himself and adore the golden statue

311 And that if any man shall not fall down and adore he should be
cast into a furnace of burning fire

312 Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the works of
the province of Babylon Sidrach Misach and Abdenago these men O
king have slighted thy decree they worship not thy gods nor do they
adore the golden statue which thou hast set up

313 Then Nabuchodonosor in fury and in wrath commanded that
Sidrach Misach ad Abdenago should be brought who immediately were
brought before the king

314 And Nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them and said Is it
true O Sidrach Misach and Abdenago that you do not worship my gods
nor adore the golden statue that I have set up

315 Now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall
hear the sound of the trumpet flute harp sackbut and psaltery and
symphony and of all kind of music prostrate yourselves and adore the
statue which I have made but if you do not adore you shall be cast
the same hour into the furnace of burning fire and who is the God that
shall deliver you out of my hand

316 Sidrach Misach and Abdenago answered and said to king
Nabuchodonosor We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this
matter

317 For behold our God whom we worship is able to save us from the
furnace of burning fire and to deliver us out of thy hands O king

318 But if he will not be it known to thee O king that we will not
worship thy gods nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up

319 Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury and the countenance of
his face was changed against Sidrach Misach and Abdenago and he
commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it
had been accustomed to be heated

320 And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army to bind
the feet of Sidrach Misach and Abdenago and to cast them into the
furnace of burning fire

321 And immediately these men were bound and were cast into the
furnace of burning fire with their coats and their caps and their
shoes and their garments

322 For the kings commandment was urgent and the furnace was heated
exceedingly And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in
Sidrach Misach and Abdenago

323 But these three men that is Sidrach Misach and Abdenago fell
down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire

324 And they walked in the midst of the flame praising God and
blessing the Lord

And they walked etc  Here St Jerome takes notice that from this
verse to ver 91 was not in the Hebrew in his time But as it was in
all the Greek Bibles which were originally translated from the
Hebrew it is more than probable that it had been formerly in the
Hebrew or rather in the Chaldaic in which the book of Daniel was
written But this is certain that it is and has been of old received
by the church and read as canonical scripture in her liturgy and
divine offices

325 Then Azarias standing up prayed in this manner and opening his
mouth in the midst of the fire he said

326 Blessed art thou O Lord the God of our fathers and thy name is
worthy of praise and glorious for ever

327 For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us and all thy
works are true and thy ways right and all thy judgments true

328 For thou hast executed true judgments in all the things that thou
hast brought upon us and upon Jerusalem the holy city of our fathers
for according to truth and judgment thou hast brought all these things
upon us for our sins

329 For we have sinned and committed iniquity departing from thee
and we have trespassed in all things

330 And we have not hearkened to thy commandments nor have we
observed nor done as thou hadst commanded us that it might go well
with us

331 Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us and every thing
that thou hast done to us thou hast done in true judgment

332 And thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies that are
unjust and most wicked and prevaricators and to a king unjust and
most wicked beyond all that are upon the earth

333 And now we cannot open our mouths we are become a shame and a
reproach to thy servants and to them that worship thee

334 Deliver us not up for ever we beseech thee for thy names sake
and abolish not thy covenant

335 And take not away thy mercy from us for the sake of Abraham thy
beloved and Isaac thy servant and Israel thy holy one

336 To whom thou hast spoken promising that thou wouldst multiply
their seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the sea
shore

337 For we O Lord are diminished more than any nation and are
brought low in all the earth this day for our sins

338 Neither is there at this time prince or leader or prophet or
holocaust or sacrifice or oblation or incense or place of first
fruits before thee

339 That we may find thy mercy nevertheless in a contrite heart and
humble spirit let us be accepted

340 As in holocausts of rams and bullocks and as in thousands of
fat lambs so let our sacrifice be made in thy sight this day that it
may please thee for there is no confusion to them that trust in thee

341 And now we follow thee with all our heart and we fear thee and
seek thy face

342 Put us not to confusion but deal with us according to thy
meekness and according to the multitude of thy mercies

343 And deliver us according to thy wonderful works and give glory
to thy name O Lord

344 And let all them be confounded that shew evils to thy servants
let them be confounded in all thy might and let their strength be
broken

345 And let them know that thou art the Lord the only God and
glorious over all the world

346 Now the kings servants that had cast them in ceased not to heat
the furnace with brimstone and tow and pitch and dry sticks

347 And the flame mounted up above the furnace nine and forth cubits

348 And it broke forth and burnt such of the Chaldeans as it found
near the furnace

349 But the angel of the Lord went down with Azarias and his
companions into the furnace and he drove the flame of the fire out of
the furnace

350 And made the midst of the furnace like the blowing of a wind
bringing dew and the fire touched them not at all nor troubled them
nor did them any harm

351 Then these three as with one mouth praised and glorified and
blessed God in the furnace saying

352 Blessed art thou O Lord the God of our fathers and worthy to
be praised and glorified and exalted above all for ever and blessed
is the holy name of thy glory and worthy to be praised and exalted
above all in all ages

353 Blessed art thou in the holy temple of thy glory and exceedingly
to be praised and exalted above all for ever

354 Blessed art thou on the throne of thy kingdom and exceedingly to be
praised and exalted above all forever

355 Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths and sittest upon the
cherubims and worthy to be praised and exalted above all for ever

356 Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven and worthy of
praise and glorious for ever

389 O give thanks to the Lord because he is good because his mercy
endureth for ever and ever

390 O all ye religious bless the Lord the God of gods praise him
and give him thanks because his mercy endureth for ever and ever

391 Then Nabuchodonosor the king was astonished and rose up in
haste and said to his nobles Did we not cast three men bound into the
midst of the fire They answered the king and said True O king

392 He answered and said Behold I see four men loose and walking
in the midst of the fire and there is no hurt in them and the form of
the fourth is like the son of God

393 Then Nabuchodonosor came to the door of the burning fiery
furnace and said Sidrach Misach and Abdenago ye servants of the
most high God go ye forth and come And immediately Sidrach Misach
and Abdenago went out from the midst of the fire

394 And the nobles and the magistrates and the judges and the
great men of the king being gathered together considered these men
that the fire had no power on their bodies and that not a hair of
their head had been singed nor their garments altered nor the smell
of the fire had passed on them

395 Then Nabuchodonosor breaking forth said Blessed be the God of
them to wit of Sidrach Misach and Abdenago who hath sent his
angel and delivered his servants that believed in him and they
changed the kings word and delivered up their bodies that they might
not serve nor adore any god except their own God

396 By me therefore this decree is made That every people tribe
and tongue which shall speak blasphemy against the God of Sidrach
Misach and Abdenago shall be destroyed and their houses laid waste
for there is no other God that can save in this manner

397 Then the king promoted Sidrach Misach and Abdenago in the
province of Babylon

398 Nabuchodonosor the king to all peoples nations and tongues
that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you

Nabuchodonosor etc  These last three verses are a kind of preface to
the following chapter which is written in the style of an epistle from
the king

399 The most high God hath wrought signs and wonders towards me It
hath seemed good to me therefore to publish

3100 His signs because they are great and his wonders because they
are mighty and his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his power to
all generations



Daniel Chapter 4


Nabuchodonosors dream by which the judgments of God are denounced
against him for his pride is interpreted by Daniel and verified by
the event

41 I Nabuchodonosor was at rest in my house and flourishing in my
palace

42 I saw a dream that affrighted me and my thoughts in my bed and
the visions of my head troubled me

43 Then I set forth a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should
be brought in before me and that they should shew me the
interpretation of the dream

44 Then came in the diviners the wise men the Chaldeans and the
soothsayers and I told the dream before them but they did not shew me
the interpretation thereof

45 Till their colleague Daniel came in before me whose name is
Baltassar according to the name of my god who hath in him the spirit
of the holy gods and I told the dream before him

Baltassar according to the name of my god  He says this because the
name of Baltassar or Belteshazzar is derived from the name of Bel
the chief god of the Babylonians

46 Baltassar prince of the diviners because I know that thou hast
in thee the spirit of the holy gods and that no secret is impossible
to thee tell me the visions of my dreams that I have seen and the
interpretation of them

47 This was the vision of my head in my bed I saw and behold a tree
in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was exceeding great

48 The tree was great and strong and the height thereof reached unto
heaven the sight thereof was even to the ends of all the earth

49 Its leaves were most beautiful and its fruit exceeding much and
in it was food for all under it dwelt cattle and beasts and in the
branches thereof the fowls of the air had their abode and all flesh
did eat of it

410 I saw in the vision of my head upon my bed and behold a watcher
and a holy one came down from heaven

A watcher  A vigilant angel perhaps the guardian of Israel

411 He cried aloud and said thus Cut down the tree and chop off
the branches thereof shake off its leaves and scatter its fruits let
the beasts fly away that are under it and the birds from its branches

412 Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth and let
it be tied with a band of iron and of brass among the grass that is
without and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let its portion
be with the wild beasts in the grass of the earth

413 Let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be
given him and let seven times pass over him

Let his heart be changed etc  It does not appear by scripture that
Nabuchodonosor was changed from human shape much less that he was
changed into an ox but only that he lost his reason and became mad
and in this condition remained abroad in the company of beasts eating
grass like an ox till his hair grew in such manner as to resemble the
feathers of eagles and his nails to be like birds claws

414 This is the decree by the sentence of the watchers and the word
and demand of the holy ones till the living know that the most High
ruleth in the kingdom of men and he will give it to whomsoever it
shall please him and he will appoint the basest man over it

415 I king Nabuchodonosor saw this dream thou therefore O
Baltassar tell me quickly the interpretation for all the wise men of
my kingdom are not able to declare the meaning of it to me but thou
art able because the spirit of the holy gods is in thee

416 Then Daniel whose name was Baltassar began silently to think
within himself for about one hour and his thought troubled him But
the king answering said Baltassar let not the dream and the
interpretation thereof trouble thee Baltassar answered and said My
lord the dream be to them that hate thee and the interpretation
thereof to thy enemies

417 The tree which thou sawest which was high and strong whose
height reached to the skies and the sight thereof into all the earth

418 And the branches thereof were most beautiful and its fruit
exceeding much and in it was food for all under which the beasts of
the field dwelt and the birds of the air had their abode in its
branches

419 It is thou O king who art grown great and become mighty for
thy greatness hath grown and hath reached to heaven and thy power
unto the ends of the earth

420 And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one come down from
heaven and say Cut down the tree and destroy it but leave the stump
of the roots thereof in the earth and let it be bound with iron and
brass among the grass without and let it be sprinkled with the dew of
heaven and let his feeding be with the wild beasts till seven times
pass over him

421 This is the interpretation of the sentence of the most High
which is come upon my lord the king

422 They shall cast thee out from among men and thy dwelling shall
be with cattle and with wild beasts and thou shalt eat grass as an
ox and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass
over thee till thou know that the most High ruleth over the kingdom of
men and giveth it to whomsoever he will

423 But whereas he commanded that the stump of the roots thereof
that is of the tree should be left thy kingdom shall remain to thee
after thou shalt have known that power is from heaven

424 Wherefore O king let my counsel be acceptable to thee and
redeem thou thy sins with alms and thy iniquities with works of mercy
to the poor perhaps he will forgive thy offences

425 All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor

426 At the end of twelve months he was walking in the palace of
Babylon

427 And the king answered and said Is not this the great Babylon
which I have built to be the seat of the kingdom by the strength of
my power and in the glory of my excellence

428 And while the word was yet in the kings mouth a voice came down
from heaven To thee O king Nabuchodonosor it is said Thy kingdom
shall pass from thee

429 And they shall cast thee out from among men and thy dwelling
shall be with cattle and wild beasts thou shalt eat grass like an ox
and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the most High
ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will

430 The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor and he
was driven away from among men and did eat grass like an ox and his
body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs grew like the
feathers of eagles and his nails like birds claws

431 Now at the end of the days I Nabuchodonosor lifted up my eyes
to heaven and my sense was restored to me and I blessed the most
High and I praised and glorified him that liveth for ever for his
power is an everlasting power and his kingdom is to all generations

432 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing
before him for he doth according to his will as well with the powers
of heaven as among the inhabitants of the earth and there is none
that can resist his hand and say to him Why hast thou done it

433 At the same time my sense returned to me and I came to the
honour and glory of my kingdom and my shape returned to me and my
nobles and my magistrates sought for me and I was restored to my
kingdom and greater majesty was added to me

434 Therefore I Nabuchodonosor do now praise and magnify and
glorify the King of heaven because all his works are true and his
ways judgments and them that walk in pride he is able to abase

I Nabuchodonosor do now etc  From this place some commentators
infer that this king became a true convert and dying not long after
was probably saved



Daniel Chapter 5


Baltasars profane banquet his sentence is denounced by a handwriting
on the wall which Daniel reads and interprets

51 Baltasar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his
nobles and every one drank according to his age

Baltasar  He is believed to be the same as Nabonydus the last of the
Chaldean kings grandson to Nabuchodonosor He is called his son ver
2 11 etc according to the style of the scriptures because he was a
descendant from him

52 And being now drunk he commanded that they should bring the
vessels of gold and silver which Nabuchodonosor his father had
brought away out of the temple that was in Jerusalem that the king
and his nobles and his wives and his concubines might drink in them

53 Then were the golden and silver vessels brought which he had
brought away out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and the king and
his nobles his wives and his concubines drank in them

54 They drank wine and praised their gods of gold and of silver of
brass of iron and of wood and of stone

55 In the same hour there appeared fingers as it were of the hand of
a man writing over against the candlestick upon the surface of the
wall of the kings palace and the king beheld the joints of the hand
that wrote

56 Then was the kings countenance changed and his thoughts troubled
him and the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees struck one
against the other

57 And the king cried out aloud to bring in the wise men the
Chaldeans and the soothsayers And the king spoke and said to the
wise men of Babylon Whosoever shall read this writing and shall make
known to me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with purple
and shall have a golden chain on his neck and shall be the third man
in my kingdom

58 Then came in all the kings wise men but they could neither read
the writing nor declare the interpretation to the king

59 Wherewith king Baltasar was much troubled and his countenance was
changed and his nobles also were troubled

510 Then the queen on occasion of what had happened to the king and
his nobles came into the banquethouse and she spoke and said O
king live for ever let not thy thoughts trouble thee neither let thy
countenance be changed

The queen  Not the wife but the mother of the king

511 There is a man in thy kingdom that hath the spirit of the holy
gods in him and in the days of thy father knowledge and wisdom were
found in him for king Nabuchodonosor thy father appointed him prince
of the wise men enchanters Chaldeans and soothsayers thy father I
say O king

512 Because a greater spirit and knowledge and understanding and
interpretation of dreams and shewing of secrets and resolving of
difficult things were found in him that is in Daniel whom the king
named Baltassar Now therefore let Daniel be called for and he will
tell the interpretation

513 Then Daniel was brought in before the king And the king spoke
and said to him Art thou Daniel of the children of the captivity of
Juda whom my father the king brought out of Judea

514 I have heard of thee that thou hast the spirit of the gods and
excellent knowledge and understanding and wisdom are found in thee

515 And now the wise men the magicians have come in before me to
read this writing and shew me the interpretation thereof and they
could not declare to me the meaning of this writing

516 But I have heard of thee that thou canst interpret obscure
things and resolve difficult things now if thou art able to read the
writing and to shew me the interpretation thereof thou shalt be
clothed with purple and shalt have a chain of gold about thy neck and
shalt be the third prince in my kingdom

517 To which Daniel made answer and said before the king thy
rewards be to thyself and the gifts of thy house give to another but
the writing I will read to thee O king and shew thee the
interpretation thereof

518 O king the most high God gave to Nabuchodonosor thy father a
kingdom and greatness and glory and honour

519 And for the greatness that he gave to him all people tribes
and languages trembled and were afraid of him whom he would he slew
and whom he would he destroyed and whom he would he set up and whom
he would he brought down

520 But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit hardened unto
pride he was put down from the throne of his kingdom and his glory
was taken away

521 And he was driven out from the sons of men and his heart was
made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses and he
did eat grass like an ox and his body was wet with the dew of heaven
till he knew that the most High ruled in the kingdom of men and that
he will set over it whomsoever it shall please him

522 Thou also his son O Baltasar hast not humbled thy heart
whereas thou knewest all these things

523 But hast lifted thyself up against the Lord of heaven and the
vessels of his house have been brought before thee and thou and thy
nobles and thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine in them and
thou hast praised the gods of silver and of gold and of brass of
iron and of wood and of stone that neither see nor hear nor feel
but the God who hath thy breath in his hand and all thy ways thou
hast not glorified

524 Wherefore he hath sent the part of the hand which hath written
this that is set down

525 And this is the writing that is written MANE THECEL PHARES

526 And this is the interpretation of the word MANE God hath
numbered thy kingdom and hath finished it

527 THECEL thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting

528 PHARES thy kingdom is divided and is given to the Medes and
Persians

529 Then by the kings command Daniel was clothed with purple and a
chain of gold was put about his neck and it was proclaimed of him that
he had power as the third man in the kingdom

530 The same night Baltasar the Chaldean king was slain

531 And Darius the Mede succeeded to the kingdom being threescore
and two years old

Darius  He is called Cyaxares by the historians and was the son of
Astyages and uncle to Cyrus



Daniel Chapter 6


Daniel is promoted by Darius his enemies procure a law forbidding
prayer for the transgression of this law Daniel is cast into the
lions den but miraculously delivered

61 It seemed good to Darius and he appointed over the kingdom a
hundred and twenty governors to be over his whole kingdom

62 And three princes over them of whom Daniel was one that the
governors might give an account to them and the king might have no
trouble

63 And Daniel excelled all the princes and governors because a
greater spirit of God was in him

64 And the king thought to set him over all the kingdom whereupon
the princes and the governors sought to find occasion against Daniel
with regard to the king and they could find no cause nor suspicion
because he was faithful and no fault nor suspicion was found in him

65 Then these men said We shall not find any occasion against this
Daniel unless perhaps concerning the law of his God

66 Then the princes and the governors craftily suggested to the
king and spoke thus unto him King Darius live for ever

67 All the princes of the kingdom the magistrates and governors
the senators and judges have consulted together that an imperial
decree and an edict be published That whosoever shall ask any
petition of any god or man for thirty days but of thee O king
shall be cast into the den of the lions

68 Now therefore O king confirm the sentence and sign the decree
that what is decreed by the Medes and Persians may not be altered nor
any man be allowed to transgress it

69 So king Darius set forth the decree and established it

610 Now when Daniel knew this that is to say that the law was
made he went into his house and opening the windows in his upper
chamber towards Jerusalem he knelt down three times a day and adored
and gave thanks before his God as he had been accustomed to do before

611 Wherefore those men carefully watching him found Daniel praying
and making supplication to his God

612 And they came and spoke to the king concerning the edict O king
hast thou not decreed that every man that should make a request to any
of the gods or men for thirty days but to thyself O king should be
cast into the den of the lions And the king answered them saying The
word is true according to the decree of the Medes and Persians which
it is not lawful to violate

613 Then they answered and said before the king Daniel who is of
the children of the captivity of Juda hath not regarded thy law nor
the decree that thou hast made but three times a day he maketh his
prayer

614 Now when the king had heard these words he was very much
grieved and in behalf of Daniel he set his heart to deliver him and
even till sunset he laboured to save him

615 But those men perceiving the kings design said to him Know
thou O king that the law of the Medes and Persians is that no decree
which the king hath made may be altered

616 Then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him
into the den of the lions And the king said to Daniel Thy God whom
thou always servest he will deliver thee

617 And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den
which the king sealed with his own ring and with the ring of his
nobles that nothing should be done against Daniel

618 And the king went away to his house and laid himself down
without taking supper and meat was not set before him and even sleep
departed from him

619 Then the king rising very early in the morning went in haste to
the lions den

620 And coming near to the den cried with a lamentable voice to
Daniel and said to him Daniel servant of the living God hath thy
God whom thou servest always been able thinkest thou to deliver
thee from the lions

621 And Daniel answering the king said O king live for ever

622 My God hath sent his angel and hath shut up the mouths of the
lions and they have not hurt me forasmuch as before him justice hath
been found in me yea and before thee O king I have done no offence

623 Then was the king exceeding glad for him and he commanded that
Daniel should be taken out of the den and Daniel was taken out of the
den and no hurt was found in him because he believed in his God

624 And by the kings commandment those men were brought that had
accused Daniel and they were cast into the lions den they and their
children and their wives and they did not reach the bottom of the
den before the lions caught them and broke all their bones in pieces

625 Then king Darius wrote to all people tribes and languages
dwelling in the whole earth PEACE be multiplied unto you

626 It is decreed by me that in all my empire and my kingdom all
men dread and fear the God of Daniel For he is the living and eternal
God for ever and his kingdom shall not be destroyed and his power
shall be for ever

627 He is the deliverer and saviour doing signs and wonders in
heaven and in earth who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions den

628 Now Daniel continued unto the reign of Darius and the reign of
Cyrus the Persian



Daniel Chapter 7


Daniels vision of the four beasts signifying four kingdoms of God
sitting on his throne and of the opposite kingdoms of Christ and
Antichrist

71 In the first year of Baltasar king of Babylon Daniel saw a
dream and the vision of his head was upon his bed and writing the
dream he comprehended it in a few words and relating the sum of it in
short he said

72 I saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the
heavens strove upon the great sea

73 And four great beasts different one from another came up out of
the sea

Four great beasts  Viz the Chaldean Persian Grecian and Roman
empires But some rather choose to understand the fourth beast of the
successors of Alexander the Great more especially of them that reigned
in Asia and Syria

74 The first was like a lioness and had the wings of an eagle I
beheld till her wings were plucked off and she was lifted up from the
earth and stood upon her feet as a man and the heart of a man was
given to her

75 And behold another beast like a bear stood up on one side and
there were three rows in the mouth thereof and in the teeth thereof
and thus they said to it Arise devour much flesh

76 After this I beheld and lo another like a leopard and it had
upon it four wings as of a fowl and the beast had four heads and
power was given to it

77 After this I beheld in the vision of the night and lo a fourth
beast terrible and wonderful and exceeding strong it had great iron
teeth eating and breaking in pieces and treading down the rest with
his feet and it was unlike to the other beasts which I had seen before
it and had ten horns

Ten horns  That is ten kingdoms as Apoc 1712 among which the
empire of the fourth beast shall be parcelled Or ten kings of the
number of the successors of Alexander as figures of such as shall be
about the time of Antichrist

78 I considered the horns and behold another little horn sprung out
of the midst of them and three of the first horns were plucked up at
the presence thereof and behold eyes like the eyes of a man were in
this horn and a mouth speaking great things

Another little horn  This is commonly understood of Antichrist It
may also be applied to that great persecutor Antiochus Epiphanes as a
figure of Antichrist

79 I beheld till thrones were placed and the ancient of days sat
his garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like clean
wool his throne like flames of fire the wheels of it like a burning
fire

710 A swift stream of fire issued forth from before him thousands of
thousands ministered to him and ten thousand times a hundred thousand
stood before him the judgment sat and the books were opened

711 I beheld because of the voice of the great words which that horn
spoke and I saw that the beast was slain and the body thereof was
destroyed and given to the fire to be burnt

712 And that the power of the other beasts was taken away and that
times of life were appointed them for a time and a time

713 I beheld therefore in the vision of the night and lo one like
the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven and he came even to the
ancient of days and they presented him before him

714 And he gave him power and glory and a kingdom and all peoples
tribes and tongues shall serve him his power is an everlasting power
that shall not be taken away and his kingdom that shall not be
destroyed

715 My spirit trembled I Daniel was affrighted at these things
and the visions of my head troubled me

716 I went near to one of them that stood by and asked the truth of
him concerning all these things and he told me the interpretation of
the words and instructed me

717 These four great beasts are four kingdoms which shall arise out
of the earth

718 But the saints of the most high God shall take the kingdom and
they shall possess the kingdom for ever and ever

719 After this I would diligently learn concerning the fourth beast
which was very different from all and exceeding terrible his teeth
and claws were of iron he devoured and broke in pieces and the rest
he stamped upon with his feet

720 And concerning the ten horns that he had on his head and
concerning the other that came up before which three horns fell and
of that horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking great things and was
greater than the rest

721 I beheld and lo that horn made war against the saints and
prevailed over them

722 Till the ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of
the most High and the time came and the saints obtained the kingdom

723 And thus he said The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
upon earth which shall be greater than all the kingdoms and shall
devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in
pieces

724 And the ten horns of the same kingdom shall be ten kings and
another shall rise up after them and he shall be mightier than the
former and he shall bring down three kings

725 And he shall speak words against the High One and shall crush
the saints of the most High and he shall think himself able to change
times and laws and they shall be delivered into his hand until a time
and times and half a time

A time and times and half a time  That is three years and a half
which is supposed to be the length of the duration of the persecution
of Antichrist

726 And a judgment shall sit that his power may be taken away and
be broken in pieces and perish even to the end

727 And that the kingdom and power and the greatness of the
kingdom under the whole heaven may be given to the people of the
saints of the most High whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and
all kings shall serve him and shall obey him

728 Hitherto is the end of the word I Daniel was much troubled
with my thoughts and my countenance was changed in me but I kept the
word in my heart



Daniel Chapter 8


Daniels vision of the ram and the he goat interpreted by the angel
Gabriel

81 In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar a vision appeared
to me I Daniel after what I had seen in the beginning

82 Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa which is in the
province of Elam and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of
Ulai

83 And I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold a ram stood before
the water having two high horns and one higher than the other and
growing up Afterward

A ram  The empire of the Medes and Persians

84 I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west and against
the north and against the south and no beasts could withstand him
nor be delivered out of his hand and he did according to his own will
and became great

85 And I understood and behold a he goat came from the west on the
face of the whole earth and he touched not the ground and the he goat
had a notable horn between his eyes

A he goat  The empire of the Greeks or Macedonians Ibid He
touched not the ground  He conquered all before him with so much
rapidity that he seemed rather to fly than to walk upon the
earthIbid A notable horn  Alexander the Great

86 And he went up to the ram that had the horns which I had seen
standing before the gate and he ran towards him in the force of his
strength

87 And when he was come near the ram he was enraged against him and
struck the ram and broke his two horns and the ram could not
withstand him and when he had cast him down on the ground he stamped
upon him and none could deliver the ram out of his hand

88 And the he goat became exceeding great and when he was grown the
great horn was broken and there came up four horns under it towards
the four winds of heaven

Four horns  Seleucus Antigonus Philip and Ptolemeus the
successors of Alexander who divided his empire among them

89 And out of one of them came forth a little horn and it became
great against the south and against the east and against the
strength

A little horn  Antiochus Epiphanes a descendant of Seleucus He grew
against the south and the east by his victories over the kings of
Egypt and Armenia and against the strength that is against Jerusalem
and the people of God

810 And it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven and it
threw down of the strength and of the stars and trod upon them

Unto the strength of heaven  or against the strength of heaven So
are here called the army of the Jews the people of God

811 And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength and it
took away from him the continual sacrifice and cast down the place of
his sanctuary

812 And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice
because of sins and truth shall be cast down on the ground and he
shall do and shall prosper

813 And I heard one of the saints speaking and one saint said to
another I know not to whom that was speaking How long shall be the
vision concerning the continual sacrifice and the sin of the
desolation that is made and the sanctuary and the strength be trodden
under foot

814 And he said to him Unto evening and morning two thousand three
hundred days and the sanctuary shall be cleansed

Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days  That is
six years and almost four months which was the whole time from the
beginning of the persecution of Antiochus till his death

815 And it came to pass when I Daniel saw the vision and sought
the meaning that behold there stood before me as it were the
appearance of a man

816 And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai and he called and
said Gabriel make this man to understand the vision

817 And he came and stood near where I stood and when he was come
I fell on my face trembling and he said to me Understand O son of
man for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled

818 And when he spoke to me I fell flat on the ground and he
touched me and set me upright

819 And he said to me I will shew thee what things are to come to
pass in the end of the malediction for the time hath its end

820 The ram which thou sawest with horns is the king of the Medes
and Persians

821 And the he goat is the king of the Greeks and the great horn
that was between his eyes the same is the first king

822 But whereas when that was broken there arose up four for it
four kings shall rise up of his nation but not with his strength

823 And after their reign when iniquities shall be grown up there
shall arise a king of a shameless face and understanding dark
sentences

824 And his power shall be strengthened but not by his own force
and he shall lay all things waste and shall prosper and do more than
can be believed And he shall destroy the mighty and the people of the
saints

825 According to his will and craft shall be successful in his hand
and his heart shall be puffed up and in the abundance of all things he
shall kill many and he shall rise up against the prince of princes
and shall be broken without hand

826 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is
true thou therefore seal up the vision because it shall come to
pass after many days

827 And I Daniel languished and was sick for some days and when I
was risen up I did the kings business and I was astonished at the
vision and there was none that could interpret it



Daniel Chapter 9


Daniels confession and prayer Gabriel informs him concerning the
seventy weeks to the coming of Christ

91 In the first year of Darius the son of Assuerus of the seed of
the Medes who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans

92 The first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the
number of the years concerning which the word of the Lord came to
Jeremias the prophet that seventy years should be accomplished of the
desolation of Jerusalem

93 And I set my face to the Lord my God to pray and make
supplication with fasting and sackcloth and ashes

94 And I prayed to the Lord my God and I made my confession and
said I beseech thee O Lord God great and terrible who keepest the
covenant and mercy to them that love thee and keep thy commandments

95 We have sinned we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly
and have revolted and we have gone aside from thy commandments and
thy judgments

96 We have not hearkened to thy servants the prophets that have
spoken in thy name to our kings to our princes to our fathers and to
all the people of the land

97 To thee O Lord justice but to us confusion of face as at this
day to the men of Juda and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all
Israel to them that are near and to them that are far off in all the
countries whither thou hast driven them for their iniquities by which
they have sinned against thee

98 O Lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our princes and to
our fathers that have sinned

99 But to thee the Lord our God mercy and forgiveness for we have
departed from thee

910 And we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God to
walk in his law which he set before us by his servants the prophets

911 And all Israel have transgressed thy law and have turned away
from hearing thy voice and the malediction and the curse which is
written in the book of Moses the servant of God is fallen upon us
because we have sinned against him

912 And he hath confirmed his words which he spoke against us and
against our princes that judged us that he would bring in upon us a
great evil such as never was under all the heaven according to that
which hath been done in Jerusalem

913 As it is written in the law of Moses all this evil is come upon
us and we entreated not thy face O Lord our God that we might turn
from our iniquities and think on thy truth

914 And the Lord hath watched upon the evil and hath brought it upon
us the Lord our God is just in all his works which he hath done for
we have not hearkened to his voice

915 And now O Lord our God who hast brought forth thy people out
of the land of Egypt with a strong hand and hast made thee a name as
at this day we have sinned we have committed iniquity

916 O Lord against all thy justice let thy wrath and thy
indignation be turned away I beseech thee from thy city Jerusalem
and from thy holy mountain For by reason of our sins and the
iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people are a reproach to
all that are round about us

917 Now therefore O our God hear the supplication of thy servant
and his prayers and shew thy face upon thy sanctuary which is
desolate for thy own sake

918 Incline O my God thy ear and hear open thy eyes and see our
desolation and the city upon which thy name is called for it is not
for our justifications that we present our prayers before thy face but
for the multitude of thy tender mercies

919 O Lord hear O Lord be appeased hearken and do delay not
for thy own sake O my God because thy name is invocated upon thy
city and upon thy people

920 Now while I was yet speaking and praying and confessing my
sins and the sins of my people of Israel and presenting my
supplications in the sight of my God for the holy mountain of my God

921 As I was yet speaking in prayer behold the man Gabriel whom I
had seen in the vision at the beginning flying swiftly touched me at
the time of the evening sacrifice

The man Gabriel  The angel Gabriel in the shape of a man

922 And he instructed me and spoke to me and said O Daniel I am
now come forth to teach thee and that thou mightest understand

923 From the beginning of thy prayers the word came forth and I am
come to shew it to thee because thou art a man of desires therefore
do thou mark the word and understand the vision

Man of desires  that is ardently praying for the Jews then in
captivity

924 Seventy weeks are shortened upon thy people and upon thy holy
city that transgression may be finished and sin may have an end and
iniquity may be abolished and everlasting justice may be brought and
vision and prophecy may be fulfilled and the Saint of saints may be
anointed

Seventy weeks  Viz of years or seventy times seven that is 490
years are shortened that is fixed and determined so that the time
shall be no longer

925 Know thou therefore and take notice that from the going forth
of the word to build up Jerusalem again unto Christ the prince
there shall be seven weeks and sixtytwo weeks and the street shall
be built again and the walls in straitness of times

From the going forth of the word etc  That is from the twentieth
year of king Artaxerxes when by his commandment Nehemias rebuilt the
walls of Jerusalem 2 Esd 2 From which time according to the best
chronology there were just sixtynine weeks of years that is 483
years to the baptism of Christ when he first began to preach and
execute the office of MessiasIbid In straitness of
times  angustia temporum which may allude both to the difficulties
and opposition they met with in building and to the shortness of the
time in which they finished the wall viz fiftytwo days

926 And after sixtytwo weeks Christ shall be slain and the people
that shall deny him shall not be his And a people with their leader
that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end
thereof shall be waste and after the end of the war the appointed
desolation

A people with their leader  The Romans under Titus

927 And he shall confirm the covenant with many in one week and in
the half of the week the victim and the sacrifice shall fail and there
shall be in the temple the abomination of desolation and the
desolation shall continue even to the consummation and to the end

In the half of the week  or in the middle of the week etc Because
Christ preached three years and a half and then by his sacrifice upon
the cross abolished all the sacrifices of the lawIbid The
abomination of desolation  Some understand this of the profanation of
the temple by the crimes of the Jews and by the bloody faction of the
zealots Others of the bringing in thither the ensigns and standard of
the pagan Romans Others in fine distinguish three different times of
desolation viz that under Antiochus that when the temple was
destroyed by the Romans and the last near the end of the world under
Antichrist To all which as they suppose this prophecy may have a
relation



Daniel Chapter 10


Daniel having humbled himself by fasting and penance seeth a vision
with which he is much terrified but he is comforted by an angel

101 In the third year of Cyrus king of the Persians a word was
revealed to Daniel surnamed Baltassar and a true word and great
strength and he understood the word for there is need of
understanding in a vision

102 In those days I Daniel mourned the days of three weeks

103 I ate no desirable bread and neither flesh nor wine entered
into my mouth neither was I anointed with ointment till the days of
three weeks were accomplished

104 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month I was by
the great river which is the Tigris

105 And I lifted up my eyes and I saw and behold a man clothed in
linen and his loins were girded with the finest gold

106 And his body was like the chrysolite and his face as the
appearance of lightning and his eyes as a burning lamp and his arms
and all downward even to the feet like in appearance to glittering
brass and the voice of his word like the voice of a multitude

107 And I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with
me saw it not but an exceeding great terror fell upon them and they
fled away and hid themselves

108 And I being left alone saw this great vision and there
remained no strength in me and the appearance of my countenance was
changed in me and I fainted away and retained no strength

109 And I heard the voice of his words and when I heard I lay in a
consternation upon my face and my face was close to the ground

1010 And behold a hand touched me and lifted me up upon my knees
and upon the joints of my hands

1011 And he said to me Daniel thou man of desires understand the
words that I speak to thee and stand upright for I am sent now to
thee And when he had said this word to me I stood trembling

1012 And he said to me Fear not Daniel for from the first day that
thou didst set thy heart to understand to afflict thyself in the sight
of thy God thy words have been heard and I am come for thy words

1013 But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one
and twenty days and behold Michael one of the chief princes came to
help me and I remained there by the king of the Persians

The prince etc  That is the angel guardian of Persia who according
to his office seeking the spiritual good of the Persians was desirous
that many of the Jews should remain among them

1014 But I am come to teach thee what things shall befall thy people
in the latter days for as yet the vision is for days

1015 And when he was speaking such words to me I cast down my
countenance to the ground and held my peace

1016 And behold as it were the likeness of a son of man touched my
lips then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him that stood
before me O my lord at the sight of thee my joints are loosed and no
strength hath remained in me

1017 And how can the servant of my lord speak with my lord for no
strength remaineth in me moreover my breath is stopped

1018 Therefore he that looked like a man touched me again and
strengthened me

1019 And he said Fear not O man of desires peace be to thee take
courage and be strong And when he spoke to me I grew strong and I
said Speak O my lord for thou hast strengthened me

1020 And he said Dost thou know wherefore I am come to thee And now
I will return to fight against the prince of the Persians When I went
forth there appeared the prince of the Greeks coming

1021 But I will tell thee what is set down in the scripture of truth
and none is my helper in all these things but Michael your prince

Michael your prince  The guardian general of the church of God



Daniel Chapter 11


The angel declares to Daniel many things to come with regard to the
Persian and Grecian kings more especially with regard to Antiochus as
a figure of Antichrist

111 And from the first year of Darius the Mede I stood up that he
might be strengthened and confirmed

112 And now I will shew thee the truth Behold there shall stand yet
three kings in Persia and the fourth shall be enriched exceedingly
above them all and when he shall be grown mighty by his riches he
shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece

Three kings  Viz Cambyses Smerdes Magus and Darius the son of
HystaspesIbid The fourth  Xerxes

113 But there shall rise up a strong king and shall rule with great
power and he shall do what he pleaseth

A strong king  Alexander

114 And when he shall come to his height his kingdom shall be
broken and it shall be divided towards the four winds of the heaven
but not to his posterity nor according to his power with which he
ruled For his kingdom shall be rent in peices even for strangers
besides these

115 And the king of the south shall be strengthened and one of his
princes shall prevail over him and he shall rule with great power for
his dominions shall be great

The king of the south  Ptolemeus the son of Lagus king of Egypt
which lies south of JerusalemIbid One of his princes  that is
one of Alexanders princes shall prevail over him that is shall be
stronger than the king of Egypt He speaks of Seleucus Nicator king of
Asia and Syria whose successors are here called the kings of the
north because their dominions lay to the north in respect to
Jerusalem

116 And after the end of years they shall be in league together and
the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the
north to make friendship but she shall not obtain the strength of the
arm neither shall her seed stand and she shall be given up and her
young men that brought her and they that strengthened her in these
times

The daughter of the king of the south  Viz Berenice daughter of
Ptolemeus Philadelphus given in marriage to Antiochus Theos grandson
of Seleucus

117 And a plant of the bud of her roots shall stand up and he shall
come with an army and shall enter into the province of the king of the
north and he shall abuse them and shall prevail

A plant etc  Ptolemeus Evergetes the son of Philadelphus

118 And he shall also carry away captive into Egypt their gods and
their graven things and their precious vessels of gold and silver he
shall prevail against the king of the north

The king of the north  Seleucus Callinicus

119 And the king of the south shall enter into the kingdom and shall
return to his own land

1110 And his sons shall be provoked and they shall assemble a
multitude of great forces and he shall come with haste like a flood
and he shall return and be stirred up and he shall join battle with
his force

His sons  Seleucus Ceraunius and Antiochus the Great the sons of
CallinicusIbid He shall come  Viz Antiochus the Great

1111 And the king of the south being provoked shall go forth and
shall fight against the king of the north and shall prepare an
exceeding great multitude and a multitude shall be given into his
hands

The king of the south  Ptolemeus Philopator son of Evergetes

1112 And he shall take a multitude and his heart shall be lifted up
and he shall cast down many thousands but he shall not prevail

1113 For the king of the north shall return and shall prepare a
multitude much greater than before and in the end of times and years
he shall come in haste with a great army and much riches

1114 And in those times many shall rise up against the king of the
south and the children of prevaricators of thy people shall lift up
themselves to fulfil the vision and they shall fall

1115 And the king of the north shall come and shall cast up a mount
and shall take the best fenced cities and the arms of the south shall
not withstand and his chosen ones shall rise up to resist and they
shall not have strength

1116 And he shall come upon him and do according to his pleasure
and there shall be none to stand against his face and he shall stand
in the glorious land and it shall be consumed by his hand

He shall come upon him  Viz Antiochus shall come upon the king of
the southIbid The glorious land  Judea

1117 And he shall set his face to come to possess all his kingdom
and he shall make upright conditions with him and he shall give him a
daughter of women to overthrow it and she shall not stand neither
shall she be for him

All his kingdom  Viz all the kingdom of Ptolemeus Epiphanes son of
PhilopatorIbid A daughter of women  That is a most beautiful
woman viz his daughter CleopatraIbid To overthrow it  Viz
the kingdom of Epiphanes but his policy shall not succeed for
Cleopatra shall take more to heart the interest of her husband than that
of her father

1118 And he shall turn his face to the islands and shall take many
and he shall cause the prince of his reproach to cease and his
reproach shall be turned upon him

The prince of his reproach  Seipio the Roman general called the
prince of his reproach because he overthrew Antiochus and obliged him
to submit to very dishonourable terms before he would cease from the
war

1119 And he shall turn his face to the empire of his own land and he
shall stumble and fall ans shall not be found

1120 And there shall stand up in his place one most vile and
unworthy of kingly honour and in a few days he shall be destroyed not
in rage nor in battle

One most vile  Seleucus Philopator who sent Heliodorus to plunder
the temple and was shortly after slain by the same Heliodorus

1121 And there shall stand up in his place one despised and the
kingly honour shall not be given him and he shall come privately and
shall obtain the kingdom by fraud

One despised  Viz Antiochus Epiphanes who at first was despised
and not received for king What is here said of this prince is
accommodated by St Jerome and others to Antichrist of whom this
Antiochus was a figure

1122 And the arms of the fighter shall be overcome before his face
and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenant

Of the fighter  That is of them that shall oppose him and shall
fight against himIbid The prince of the covenant  or of the
league The chief of them that conspired against him or the king of
Egypt his most powerful adversary

1123 And after friendships he will deal deceitfully with him and he
shall go up and shall overcome with a small people

1124 And he shall enter into rich and plentiful cities and he shall
do that which his fathers never did nor his fathers fathers he shall
scatter their spoils and their prey and their riches and shall
forecast devices against the best fenced places and this until a time

1125 And his strength and his heart shall be stirred up against the
king of the south with a great army and the king of the south shall
be stirred up to battle with many and very strong succours and they
shall not stand for they shall form designs against him

The king  Ptolemeus Philometor

1126 And they that eat bread with him shall destroy him and his
army shall be overthrown and many shall fall down slain

1127 And the heart of the two kings shall be to do evil and they
shall speak lies at one table and they shall not prosper because as
yet the end is unto another time

1128 And he shall return into his land with much riches and his
heart shall be against the holy covenant and he shall succeed and
shall return into his own land

1129 At the time appointed he shall return and he shall come to the
south but the latter time shall not be like the former

1130 And the galleys and the Romans shall come upon him and he shall
be struck and shall return and shall have indignation against the
covenant of the sanctuary and he shall succeed and he shall return
and shall devise against them that have forsaken the covenant of the
sanctuary

The galleys and the Romans  Popilius and the other Roman
ambassadors who came in galleys and obliged him to depart from Egypt

1131 And arms shall stand on his part and they shall defile the
sanctuary of strength and shall take away the continual sacrifice and
they shall place there the abomination unto desolation

They shall place there the abomination etc  The idol of Jupiter
Olympius which Antiochus ordered to be set up in the sanctuary of the
temple which is here called the sanctuary of strength from the
Almighty that was worshipped there

1132 And such as deal wickedly against the covenant shall deceitfully
dissemble but the people that know their God shall prevail and
succeed

1133 And they that are learned among the people shall teach many and
they shall fall by the sword and by fire and by captivity and by
spoil for many days

1134 And when they shall have fallen they shall be relieved with a
small help and many shall be joined to them deceitfully

1135 And some of the learned shall fall that they may be tried and
may be chosen and made white even to the appointed time because yet
there shall be another time

1136 And the king shall do according to his will and he shall be
lifted up and shall magnify himself against every god and he shall
speak great things against the God of gods and shall prosper till the
wrath be accomplished For the determination is made

1137 And he shall make no account of the God of his fathers and he
shall follow the lust of women and he shall not regard any gods for
he shall rise up against all things

1138 But he shall worship the god Maozim in his place and a god
whom his fathers knew not he shall worship with gold and silver and
precious stones and things of great price

The god Maozim  That is the god of forces or strong holds

1139 And he shall do this to fortify Maozim with a strange god whom
he hath acknowledged and he shall increase glory and shall give them
power over many and shall divide the land gratis

And he shall increase glory etc  He shall bestow honours riches and
lands upon them that shall worship his god

1140 And at the time prefixed the king of the south shall fight
against him and the king of the north shall come against him like a
tempest with chariots and with horsemen and with a great navy and
he shall enter into the countries and shall destroy and pass through

1141 And he shall enter into the glorious land and many shall fall
and these only shall be saved out of his hand Edom and Moab and the
principality of the children of Ammon

1142 And he shall lay his hand upon the lands and the land of Egypt
shall not escape

1143 And he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
silver and all the precious things of Egypt and he shall pass through
Lybia and Ethiopia

1144 And tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
him and he shall come with a great multitude to destroy and slay many

1145 And he shall fix his tabernacle Apadno between the seas upon
a glorious and holy mountain and he shall come even to the top
thereof and none shall help him

Apadno  Some take it for the proper name of a place others from the
Hebrew translate it his palace



Daniel Chapter 12


Michael shall stand up for the people of God with other things
relating to Antichrist and the end of the world

121 But at that time shall Michael rise up the great prince who
standeth for the children of thy people and a time shall come such as
never was from the time that nations began even until that time And
at that time shall thy people be saved every one that shall be found
written in the book

122 And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
awake some unto life everlasting and others unto reproach to see it
always

123 But they that are learned shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament and they that instruct many to justice as stars for all
eternity

Learned  Viz in the law of God and true wisdom which consists in
knowing and loving God

124 But thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to
the time appointed many shall pass over and knowledge shall be
manifold

125 And I Daniel looked and behold as it were two others stood
one on this side upon the bank of the river and another on that side
on the other bank of the river

126 And I said to the man that was clothed in linen that stood upon
the waters of the river How long shall it be to the end of these
wonders

127 And I heard the man that was clothed in linen that stood upon
the waters of the river when he had lifted up his right hand and his
left hand to heaven and had sworn by him that liveth for ever that it
should be unto a time and times and half a time And when the
scattering of the band of the holy people shall be accomplished all
these things shall be finished

128 And I heard and understood not And I said O my lord what
shall be after these things

129 And he said Go Daniel because the words are shut up and
sealed until the appointed time

1210 Many shall be chosen and made white and shall be tried as
fire and the wicked shall deal wickedly and none of the wicked shall
understand but the learned shall understand

1211 And from the time when the continual sacrifice shall be taken
away and the abomination unto desolation shall be set up there shall
be a thousand two hundred ninety days

1212 Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh unto a thousand three
hundred thirtyfive days

1213 But go thou thy ways until the time appointed and thou shalt
rest and stand in thy lot unto the end of the days



Daniel Chapter 13


The history of Susanna and the two elders

This history of Susanna in all the ancient Greek and Latin Bibles was
placed in the beginning of the book of Daniel till St Jerome in his
translation detached it from thence because he did not find it in the
Hebrew which is also the case of the history of Bel and the Dragon
But both the one and the other are received by the Catholic Church and
were from the very beginning a part of the Christian Bible

131 Now there was a man that dwelt in Babylon and his name was
Joakim

132 And he took a wife whose name was Susanna the daughter of
Helcias a very beautiful woman and one that feared God

133 For her parents being just had instructed their daughter
according to the law of Moses

134 Now Joakim was very rich and had an orchard near his house and
the Jews resorted to him because he was the most honourable of them
all

135 And there were two of the ancients of the people appointed judges
that year of whom the Lord said That iniquity came out from Babylon
from the ancient judges that seemed to govern the people

136 These men frequented the house of Joakim and all that hand any
matters of judgment came to them

137 And when the people departed away at noon Susanna went in and
walked in her husbands orchard

138 And the old men saw her going in every day and walking and they
were inflamed with lust towards her

139 And they perverted their own mind and turned away their eyes
that they might not look unto heaven nor remember just judgments

1310 So they were both wounded with the love of her yet they did not
make known their grief one to the other

1311 For they were ashamed to declare to one another their lust
being desirous to have to do with her

1312 And they watched carefully every day to see her And one said to
the other

1313 Let us now go home for it is dinner time So going out they
departed one from another

1314 And turning back again they came both to the same place and
asking one another the cause they acknowledged their lust and then
they agreed together upon a time when they might find her alone

1315 And it fell out as they watched a fit day she went in on a
time as yesterday and the day before with two maids only and was
desirous to wash herself in the orchard for it was hot weather

1316 And there was nobody there but the two old men that had hid
themselves and were beholding her

1317 So she said to the maids Bring me oil and washing balls and
shut the doors of the orchard that I may wash me

1318 And they did as she bade them and they shut the doors of the
orchard and went out by a back door to fetch what she had commanded
them and they knew not that the elders were hid within

1319 Now when the maids were gone forth the two elders arose and
ran to her and said

1320 Behold the doors of the orchard are shut and nobody seeth us
and we are in love with thee wherefore consent to us and lie with us

1321 But if thou wilt not we will bear witness against thee that a
young man was with thee and therefore thou didst send away thy maids
form thee

1322 Susanna sighed and said I am straitened on every side for if
I do this thing it is death to me and if I do it not I shall not
escape your hands

1323 But it is better for me to fall into your hands without doing
it than to sin in the sight of the Lord

1324 With that Susanna cried out with a loud voice and the elders
also cried out against her

1325 And one of them ran to the door of the orchard and opened it

1326 So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the orchard
they rushed in by the back door to see what was the matter

1327 But after the old men had spoken the servants were greatly
ashamed for never had there been any such word said of Susanna And on
the next day

1328 When the people were come to Joakim her husband the two elders
also came full of wicked device against Susanna to put her to death

1329 And they said before the people Send to Susanna daughter of
Helcias the wife of Joakim And presently they sent

1330 And she came with her parents and children and all her kindred

1331 Now Susanna was exceeding delicate and beautiful to behold

1332 But those wicked men commanded that her face should be
uncovered for she was covered that so at least they might be
satisfied with her beauty

1333 Therefore her friends and all her acquaintance wept

1334 But the two elders rising up in the midst of the people laid
their hands upon her head

1335 And she weeping looked up to heaven for her heart had
confidence in the Lord

1336 And the elders said As we walked in the orchard alone this
woman came in with two maids and shut the doors of the orchard ans
sent away the maids from her

1337 Then a young man that was there hid came to her and lay with
her

1338 But we that were in a corner of the orchard seeing this
wickedness ran up to them and we saw them lie together

1339 And him indeed we could not take because he was stronger than
us and opening the doors he leaped out

1340 But having taken this woman we asked who the young man was but
she would not tell us of this thing we are witnesses

1341 The multitude believed them as being the elders and the judges
of the people and they condemned her to death

1342 Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice and said O eternal
God who knowest hidden things who knowest all things before they come
to pass

1343 Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me and
behold I must die whereas I have done none of these things which
these men have maliciously forged against me

1344 And the Lord heard her voice

1345 And when she was led to be put to death the Lord raised up the
holy spirit of a young boy whose name was Daniel

1346 And he cried out with a loud voice I am clear from the blood of
this woman

1347 Then all the people turning themselves towards him said What
meaneth this word that thou hast spoken

1348 But he standing in the midst of them said Are ye so foolish
ye children of Israel that without examination or knowledge of the
truth you have condemned a daughter of Israel

1349 Return to judgment for they have borne false witness against
her

1350 So all the people turned again in haste and the old men said to
him Come and sit thou down among us and shew it us seeing God hath
given thee the honour of old age

1351 And Daniel said to the people Separate these two far from one
another and I will examine them

1352 So when they were put asunder one from the other he called one
of them and said to him O thou that art grown old in evil days now
are thy sins come out which thou hast committed before

1353 In judging unjust judgments oppressing the innocent and
letting the guilty to go free whereas the Lord saith The innocent and
the just thou shalt not kill

1354 Now then if thou sawest her tell me under what tree thou sawest
them conversing together He said Under a mastic tree

1355 And Daniel said Well hast thou lied against thy own head for
behold the angel of God having received the sentence of him shall cut
thee in two

1356 And having put him aside he commanded that the other should
come and he said to him O thou seed of Chanaan and not of Juda
beauty hath deceived tee and lust hath perverted thy heart

1357 Thus did you do to the daughters of Israel and they for fear
conversed with you but a daughter of Juda would not abide your
wickedness

1358 Now therefore tell me under what tree didst thou take them
conversing together And he answered Under a holm tree

1359 And Daniel said to him Well hast thou also lied against thy own
head for the angel of the Lord waiteth with a sword to cut thee in
two and to destroy you

1360 With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice and they
blessed God who saveth them that trust in him

1361 And they rose up against the two elders for Daniel had
convicted them of false witness by their own mouth and they did to
them as they had maliciously dealt against their neighbour

1362 To fulfil the law of Moses and they put them to death and
innocent blood was saved in that day

1363 But Helcias and his wife praised God for their daughter
Susanna with Joakim her husband and all her kindred because there
was no dishonesty found in her

1364 And Daniel became great in the sight of the people from that
day and thence forward

1365 And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers and Cyrus the
Persian received his kingdom



Daniel Chapter 14


The history of Bel and of the great serpent worshipped by the
Babylonians

141 And Daniel was the kings guest and was honoured above all his
friends

The kings guest  It seems most probable that the king here spoken
of was Evilmerodach the son and successor of Nabuchodonosor and a
great favourer of the Jews

142 Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel and there was spent
upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour and forty
sheep and six vessels of wine

143 The king also worshipped him and went every day to adore him
but Daniel adored his God And the king said to him Why dost thou not
adore Bel

144 And he answered and said to him Because I do not worship idols
made with hands but the living God that created heaven and earth and
hath power over all flesh

145 And the king said to him Doth not Bel seem to thee to be a
living god Seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day

146 Then Daniel smiled and said O king be not deceived for this
is but clay within and brass without neither hath he eaten at any
time

147 And the king being angry called for his priests and said to
them If you tell me not who it is that eateth up these expenses you
shall die

148 But if you can shew that Bel eateth these things Daniel shall
die because he hath blasphemed against Bel And Daniel said to the
king Be it done according to thy word

149 Now the priests of Bel were seventy beside their wives and
little ones and children And the king went with Daniel into the
temple of Bel

1410 And the priests of Bel said Behold we go out and do thou O
king set on the meats and make ready the wine and shut the door
fast and seal it with thy own ring

1411 And when thou comest in the morning if thou findest not that
Bel hath eaten up all we will suffer death or else Daniel that hath
lied against us

1412 And they little regarded it because they had made under the
table a secret entrance and they always came in by it and consumed
those things

1413 So it came to pass after they were gone out the king set the
meats before Bel and Daniel commanded his servants and they brought
ashes and he sifted them all over the temple before the king and
going forth they shut the door and having sealed it with the kings
ring they departed

1414 But the priests went in by night according to their custom
with their wives and their children and they eat and drank up all

1415 And the king arose early in the morning and Daniel with him

1416 And the king said Are the seals whole Daniel And he answered
They are whole O king

1417 And as soon as he had opened the door the king looked upon the
table and cried out with a loud voice Great art thou O Bel and
there is not any deceit with thee

1418 And Daniel laughed and he held the king that he should not go
in and he said Behold the pavement mark whose footsteps these are

1419 And the king said I see the footsteps of men and women and
children And the king was angry

1420 Then he took the priests and their wives and their children
and they shewed him the private doors by which they came in and
consumed the things that were on the table

1421 The king therefore put them to death and delivered Bel into
the power of Daniel who destroyed him and his temple

1422 And there was a great dragon in that place and the Babylonians
worshipped him

1423 And the king said to Daniel Behold thou canst not say now
that this is not a living god adore him therefore

1424 And Daniel said I adore the Lord my God for he is the living
God but that is no living god

1425 But give me leave O king and I will kill this dragon without
sword or club And the king said I give thee leave

1426 Then Daniel took pitch and fat and hair and boiled them
together and he made lumps and put them into the dragons mouth and
the dragon burst asunder And he said Behold him whom you worship

1427 And when the Babylonians had heard this they took great
indignation and being gathered together against the king they said
The king is become a Jew He hath destroyed Bel he hath killed the
dragon and he hath put the priests to death

1428 And they came to the king and said Deliver us Daniel or else
we will destroy thee and thy house

1429 And the king saw that they pressed upon him violently and being
constrained by necessity he delivered Daniel to them

1430 And they cast him into the den of lions and he was there six
days

The den of lions  Daniel was twice cast into the den of lions one
under Darius the Mede because he had transgressed the kings edict by
praying three times a day and another time under Evilmerodach by a
sedition of the people This time he remained six days in the lions
den the other time only one night

1431 And in the den there were seven lions and they had given to
them two carcasses every day and two sheep but then they were not
given unto them that they might devour Daniel

1432 Now there was in Judea a prophet called Habacuc and he had
boiled pottage and had broken bread in a bowl and was going into the
field to carry it to the reapers

Habacuc  The same as some think whose prophecy is found among the
lesser prophets but others believe him to be different

1433 And the angel of the Lord said to Habacuc Carry the dinner
which thou hast into Babylon to Daniel who is in the lions den

1434 And Habacuc said Lord I never saw Babylon nor do I know the
den

1435 And the angel of the Lord took him by the top of his head and
carried him by the hair of his head and set him in Babylon over the
den in the force of his spirit

1436 And Habacuc cried saying O Daniel thou servant of God take
the dinner that God hath sent thee

1437 And Daniel said Thou hast remembered me O God and thou hast
not forsaken them that love thee

1438 And Daniel arose and eat And the angel of the Lord presently
set Habacuc again in his own place

1439 And upon the seventh day the king came to bewail Daniel and he
came to the den and looked in and behold Daniel was sitting in the
midst of the lions

1440 And the king cried out with a loud voice saying Great art
thou O Lord the God of Daniel And he drew him out of the lions den

1441 But those that had been the cause of his destruction he cast
into the den and they were devoured in a moment before him

1442 Then the king said Let all the inhabitants of the whole earth
fear the God of Daniel for he is the Saviour working signs and
wonders in the earth who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions den




THE PROPHECY OF OSEE



OSEE or Hosea whose name signifies A saviour was the first in the
order of time among those who are commonly called lesser prophets
because their prophecies are short He prophesied in the kingdom of
Israel that is of the ten tribes about the same time that Isaias
prophesied in the kingdom of Juda



Osee Chapter 1


By marrying a harlot and by the names of his children the prophet
sets forth the crimes of Israel and their punishment He foretells
their redemption by Christ

11 The word of the Lord that came to Osee the son of Beeri in the
days of Ozias Joathan Achaz and Ezechias kings of Juda and in the
days of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel

12 The beginning of the Lords speaking by Osee and the Lord said to
Osee Go take thee a wife of fornications and have of her children of
fornications for the land by fornication shall depart from the Lord

A wife of fornications  That is a wife that has been given to
fornication This was to represent the Lords proceedings with his
people Israel who by spiritual fornication were continually
offending himIbid Children of fornications  So called from the
character of their mother if not also from their own wicked
dispositions

13 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Debelaim and she
conceived and bore him a son

14 And the Lord said to him Call his name Jezrahel for yet a little
while and I will visit the blood of Jezrahel upon the house of Jehu
and I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel

15 And in that day I will break in pieces the bow of Israel in the
valley of Jezrahel

16 And she conceived again and bore a daughter and he said to him
Call her name Without mercy for I will not add any more to have mercy
on the house of Israel but I will utterly forget them

Without mercy  LoRuhamah

17 And I will have mercy on the house of Juda and I will save them
by the Lord their God and I will not save them by bow nor by sword
nor by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen

18 And she weaned her that was called Without mercy And she
conceived and bore a son

19 And he said Call his name Not my people for you are not my
people and I will not be yours

Not my people  Loammi

110 And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of
the sea that is without measure and shall not be numbered And it
shall be in the place where it shall be said to them You are not my
people it shall be said to them Ye are the sons of the living God

The number etc  Viz of the true Israelites the children of the
church of Christ

111 And the children of Juda and the children of Israel shall be
gathered together and they shall appoint themselves one head and
shall come up out of the land for great is the day of Jezrahel

One head  viz ChristIbid Great is the day of Jezrahel  That
is of the seed of God for Jezrahel signifies the seed of God



Osee Chapter 2


Israel is justly punished for leaving God The abundance of grace in
the church of Christ

21 Say ye to your brethren You are my people and to your sister
Thou hast obtained mercy

Say to your brethren etc  or Call your brethren My people and
your sister Her that hath obtained mercy This is connected with the
latter end of the foregoing chapter and relates to the converts of
Israel

22 Judge your mother judge her because she is not my wife and I am
not her husband Let her put away her fornications from her face and
her adulteries from between her breasts

Your mother  The synagogue

23 Lest I strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was
born and I will make her as a wilderness and will set her as a land
that none can pass through and will kill her with drought

24 And I will not have mercy on her children for they are the
children of fornications

25 For their mother hath committed fornication she that conceived
them is covered with shame for she said I will go after my lovers
that give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax my oil and
my drink

26 Wherefore behold I will hedge up thy way with thorns and I will
stop it up with a wall and she shall not find her paths

27 And she shall follow after her lovers and shall not overtake
them and she shall seek them and shall not find and she shall say I
will go and return to my first husband because it was better with me
then than now

28 And she did not know that I gave her corn and wine and oil and
multiplied her silver and gold which they have used in the service of
Baal

29 Therefore will I return and take away my corn in its season and
my wine in its season and I will set at liberty my wool and my flax
which covered her disgrace

210 And now I will lay open her folly in the eyes of her lovers and
no man shall deliver her out of my hand

211 And I will cause all her mirth to cease her solemnities her new
moons her sabbaths and all her festival times

212 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees of which she
said These are my rewards which my lovers have given me and I will
make her as a forest and the beasts of the field shall devour her

213 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim to whom she burnt
incense and decked herself out with her earrings and with her jewels
and went after her lovers and forgot me saith the Lord

214 Therefore behold I will allure her and will lead her into the
wilderness and I will speak to her heart

I will allure her etc  After all her disloyalties I will still
allure her by my grace etc and send her vinedressers viz the
apostles originally her own children who shall open to her the gates
of hope as heretofore at her coming into the land of promise she had
all good success after she had satisfied the divine justice by the
execution of Achan in the valley of Achor Jos 7

215 And I will give her vinedressers out of the same place and the
valley of Achor for an opening of hope and she shall sing there
according to the days of her youth and according to the days of her
coming up out of the land of Egypt

216 And it shall be in that day saith the Lord That she shall call
me My husband and she shall call me no more Banli

My husband  In Hebrew Ishi Baali my lord The meaning of this
verse is that whereas Ishi and Baali were used indifferently in those
days by wives speaking to their husbands the synagogue whom God was
pleased to consider as his spouse should call him only Ishi and
abstain from the name of Baali because of its affinity with the idol
Baal

217 And I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth and
she shall no more remember their name

Baalim  It is the plural number of Baal for there were divers idols
of Baal

218 And in that day I will make a covenant with them with the beasts
of the field and with the fowls of the air and with the creeping
things of the earth and I will destroy the bow and the sword and war
out of the land and I will make them sleep secure

219 And I will espouse thee to me for ever and I will espouse thee
to me in justice and judgment and in mercy and in commiserations

I will espouse thee etc  This relates to the happy espousals of
Christ with his church which shall never be dissolved

220 And I will espouse thee to me in faith and thou shalt know that
I am the Lord

221 And it shall come to pass in that day I will hear saith the
Lord I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth

Hear the heavens etc  All shall conspire in favour of the church
which in the following verse is called Jezrahel that is the seed of
God

222 And the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and
these shall hear Jezrahel

223 And I will sow her unto me in the earth and I will have mercy on
her that was without mercy

224 And I will say to that which is not my people Thou art my
people and they shall say Thou art my God

That which was not my people etc  This relates to the conversion of
the Gentiles



Osee Chapter 3


The prophet is commanded again to love an adulteress to signify Gods
love to the synagogue The wretched state of the Jews for a long time
till at last they shall be converted

31 And the Lord said to me Go yet again and love a woman beloved of
her friend and an adulteress as the Lord loveth the children of
Israel and they look to strange gods and love the husks of the
grapes

32 And I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and for a
core of barley and for half a core of barley

33 And I said to her Thou shalt wait for me many days thou shalt
not play the harlot and thou shalt be no mans and I also will wait
for thee

34 For the children of Israel shall sit many days without king and
without prince and without sacrifice and without altar and without
ephod and without theraphim

Theraphim  Images or representations

35 And after this the children of Israel shall return and shall seek
the Lord their God and David their king and they shall fear the
Lord and his goodness in the last days

David their king  That is Christ who is of the house of David



Osee Chapter 4


Gods judgment against the sins of Israel Juda is warned not to follow
their example

41 Hear the word of the Lord ye children of Israel for the Lord
shall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land for there
is no truth and there is no mercy and there is no knowledge of God in
the land

42 Cursing and lying and killing and theft and adultery have
overflowed and blood hath touched blood

43 Therefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleth in it
shall languish with the heat of the field and with the fowls of the
air yea the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together

44 But yet let not any man judge and let not a man be rebuked for
thy people are as they that contradict the priest

Let not any man judge etc  As if he would say It is in vain to
strive with them or reprove them they are so obstinate in evil

45 And thou shalt fall today and the prophet also shall fall with
thee in the night I have made thy mother to be silent

46 My people have been silent because they had no knowledge because
thou hast rejected knowledge I will reject thee that thou shalt not
do the office of priesthood to me and thou hast forgotten the law of
thy God I also will forget thy children

47 According to the multitude of them so have they sinned against
me I will change their glory into shame

48 They shall eat the sins of my people and shall lift up their
souls to their iniquity

49 And there shall be like people like priest and I will visit their
ways upon them and I will repay them their devices

410 And they shall eat and shall not be filled they have committed
fornication and have not ceased because they have forsaken the Lord
in not observing the law

411 Fornication and wine and drunkenness take away the
understanding

412 My people have consulted their stocks and their staff hath
declared unto them for the spirit of fornication hath deceived them
and they have committed fornication against their God

413 They offered sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burnt
incense upon the hills under the oak and the poplar and the
turpentine tree because the shadow thereof was good therefore shall
your daughters commit fornication aud your spouses shall be
adulteresses

414 I will not visit upon your daughters when they shall commit
fornication and upon your spouses when they shall commit adultery
because themselves conversed with harlots and offered sacrifice with
the effeminate and the people that doth not understand shall be
beaten

415 If thou play the harlot O Israel at least let not Juda offend
and go ye not into Galgal and come not up into Bethaven and do not
swear The Lord liveth

Galgal and Bethaven  Places where idols were worshipped Bethel
which signifies the house of God is called by the prophet Bethaven
that is the house of vanity from Jeroboams golden calf that was
worshipped there

416 For Israel hath gone astray like a wanton heifer now will the
Lord feed them as a lamb in a spacious place

417 Ephraim is a partaker with idols let him alone

418 Their banquet is separated they have gone astray by fornication
they that should have protected them have loved to bring shame upon
them

419 The wind hath bound them up in its wings and they shall be
confounded because of their sacrifices



Osee Chapter 5


Gods threats against the priests the people and princes of Israel
for their idolatry

51 Hear ye this O priests and hearken O ye house of Israel and
give ear O house of the king for there is a judgment against you
because you have been a snare to them whom you should have watched over
and a net spread upon Thabor

O priests  What is said of priests in this prophecy is chiefly
understood of the priests of the kingdom of Israel who were not true
priests of the race of Aaron but served the calves at Bethel and Dan

52 And you have turned aside victims into the depth and I am the
teacher of them all

53 I know Ephraim and Israel is not hid from me for now Ephraim hath
committed fornication Israel is defiled

54 They will not set their thoughts to return to their God for the
spirit of fornication is in the midst of them and they have not known
the Lord

55 And the pride of Israel shall answer in his face and Israel and
Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity Juda also shall fall with them

56 With their flocks and with their herds they shall go to seek the
Lord and shall not find him he is withdrawn from them

57 They have transgressed against the Lord for they have begotten
children that are strangers now shall a month devour them with their
portions

Children that are strangers  That is aliens from God and therefore
they are threatened with speedy destruction

58 Blow ye the cornet in Gabaa the trumpet in Rama howl ye in
Bethaven behind thy back O Benjamin

59 Ephraim shall be in desolation in the day of rebuke among the
tribes of Israel I have shewn that which shall surely be

510 The princes of Juda are become as they that take up the bound I
will pour out my wrath upon them like water

As they that take up the bound  That is they that remove the
boundary encroaching on the property of their neighbors figuratively
going beyond the boundary of the laws of God

511 Ephraim is under oppression and broken in judgment because he
began to go after filthiness

512 And I will be like a moth to Ephraim and like rottenness to the
house of Juda

513 And Ephraim saw his sickness and Juda his band and Ephraim went
to the Assyrian and sent to the avenging king and he shall not be
able to heal you neither shall he be able to take off the band from
you

514 For I will be like a lioness to Ephraim and like a lions whelp
to the house of Juda I I will catch and go I will take away and
there is none that can rescue

515 I will go and return to my place until you are consumed and
seek my face



Osee Chapter 6


Affliction shall be a means to bring many to Christ a complaint of the
untowardness of the Jews God loves mercy more than sacrifice

61 In their affliction they will rise early to me Come and let us
return to the Lord

62 For he hath taken us and he will heal us he will strike and he
will cure us

63 He will revive us after two days on the third day he will raise
us up and we shall live in his sight We shall know and we shall
follow on that we may know the Lord His going forth is prepared as
the morning light and he will come to us as the early and the latter
rain to the earth

64 What shall I do to thee O Ephraim what shall I do to thee O
Juda your mercy is as a morning cloud and as the dew that goeth away
in the morning

65 For this reason have I hewed them by the prophets I have slain
them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments shall go forth as the
light

66 For I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God
more than holocausts

67 But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant there have
they dealt treacherously against me

68 Galaad is a city of workers of idols supplanted with blood

Supplanted with blood  that is undermined and brought to ruin for
shedding of blood and as it is signified in the following verse for
conspiring with the priests of Bethel like robbers to murder in the
way such as passed out of Sichem to go towards the temple of Jerusalem
Or else   upplanted with blood  signifies flowing in such manner
with blood as to suffer none to walk there without imbruing the soles
of their feet in blood

69 And like the jaws of highway robbers they conspire with the
priests who murder in the way those that pass out of Sichem for they
have wrought wickedness

610 I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel the
fornications of Ephraim there Israel is defiled

611 And thou also O Juda set thee a harvest when I shall bring
back the captivity of my people



Osee Chapter 7


The manifold sins of Israel and of their kings hinder the Lord from
healing them

71 When I would have healed Israel the iniquity of Ephraim was
discovered and the wickedness of Samaria for they have committed
falsehood and the thief is come in to steal the robber is without

72 And lest they may say in their hearts that I remember all their
wickedness their own devices now have beset them about they have been
done before my face

73 They have made the king glad with their wickedness and the
princes with their lies

Made the king glad etc  To please Jeroboam and their other kings
they have given themselves up to the wicked worship of idols which are
mere falsehood and lies

74 They are all adulterers like an oven heated by the baker the
city rested a little from the mingling of the leaven till the whole
was leavened

75 The day of our king the princes began to be mad with wine he
stretched out his hand with scorners

76 Because they have applied their heart like an oven when he laid
snares for them he slept all the night baking them in the morning he
himself was heated as a flaming fire

77 They were all heated like an oven and have devoured their judges
all their kings have fallen there is none amongst them that calleth
unto me

78 Ephraim himself is mixed among the nations Ephraim is become as
bread baked under the ashes that is not turned

79 Strangers have devoured his strength and he knew it not yea
grey hairs also are spread about upon him and he is ignorant of it

710 And the pride of Israel shall be humbled before his face and
they have not returned to the Lord their God nor have they sought him
in all these

711 And Ephraim is become as a dove that is decoyed not having a
heart they called upon Egypt they went to the Assyrians

712 And when they shall go I will spread my net upon them I will
bring them down as the fowl of the air I will strike them as their
congregation hath heard

713 Woe to them for they have departed from me they shall be wasted
because they have transgressed against me and I redeemed them and
they have spoken lies against me

714 And they have not cried to me with their heart but they howled
in their beds they have thought upon wheat and wine they are departed
from me

715 And I have chastised them and strengthened their arms and they
have imagined evil against me

716 They returned that they might be without yoke they became like
a deceitful bow their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of
their tongue This is their derision in the land of Egypt



Osee Chapter 8


The Israelites are threatened with destruction for their impiety and
idolatry

81 Let there be a trumpet in thy throat like an eagle upon the house
of the Lord because they have transgressed my covenant and have
violated my law

82 They shall call upon me O my God we Israel know thee

83 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shall
pursue him

84 They have reigned but not by me they have been princes and I
knew not of their silver and their gold they have made idols to
themselves that they might perish

85 Thy calf O Samaria is cast off my wrath is kindled against
them How long will they be incapable of being cleansed

86 For itself also is the invention of Israel a workman made it and
it is no god for the calf of Samaria shall be turned to spiders webs

87 For they shall sow wind and reap a whirlwind there is no
standing stalk in it the bud shall yield no meal and if it should
yield strangers shall eat it

88 Israel is swallowed up now is he become among the nations like an
unclean vessel

89 For they are gone up to Assyria a wild ass alone by himself
Ephraim hath given gifts to his lovers

810 But even though they shall have hired the nations now will I
gather them together and they shall rest a while from the burden of
the king and the princes

811 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin altars are become
to him unto sin

812 I shall write to him my manifold laws which have been accounted
as foreign

813 They shall offer victims they shall sacrifice flesh and shall
eat it and the Lord will not receive them now will he remember their
iniquity and will visit their sins they shall return to Egypt

814 And Israel hath forgotten his Maker and hath built temples and
Juda hath built many fenced cities and I will send a fire upon his
cities and it shall devour the houses thereof



Osee Chapter 9


The distress and captivity of Israel for their sins and idolatry

91 Rejoice not O Israel rejoice not as the nations do for thou
hast committed fornication against thy God thou hast loved a reward
upon every cornfloor

92 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the wine
shall deceive them

93 They shall not dwell in the Lords land Ephraim is returned to
Egypt and hath eaten unclean things among the Assyrians

94 They shall not offer wine to the Lord neither shall they please
him their sacrifices shall be like the bread of mourners all that
shall eat it shall be defiled for their bread is life for their soul
it shall not enter into the house of the Lord

95 What will you do in the solemn day in the day of the feast of the
Lord

96 For behold they are gone because of destruction Egypt shall
gather them together Memphis shall bury them nettles shall inherit
their beloved silver the bur shall be in their tabernacles

97 The days of visitation are come the days of repaying are come
know ye O Israel that the prophet was foolish the spiritual man was
mad for the multitude of thy iniquity and the multitude of thy
madness

98 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God the prophet is become a
snare of ruin upon all his ways madness is in the house of his God

99 They have sinned deeply as in the days of Gabaa he will remember
their iniquity and will visit their sin

910 I found Israel like grapes in the desert I saw their fathers
like the firstfruits of the fig tree in the top thereof but they went
in to Beelphegor and alienated themselves to that confusion and
became abominable as those things were which they loved

911 As for Ephraim their glory hath flown away like bird from the
birth and from the womb and from the conception

912 And though they should bring up their children I will make them
without children among men yea and woe to them when I shall depart
from them

913 Ephraim as I saw was a Tyre founded in beauty and Ephraim
shall bring out his children to the murderer

914 Give them O Lord What wilt thou give them Give them a womb
without children and dry breasts

915 All their wickedness is in Galgal for there I hated them for
the wickedness of their devices I will cast them forth out of my house
I will love them no more all their princes are revolters

916 Ephraim is struck their root is dried up they shall yield no
fruit And if they should have issue I will slay the best beloved
fruit of their womb

917 My God will cast them away because they hearkened not to him
and they shall be wanderers among the nations



Osee Chapter 10


After many benefits great affliction shall fall upon the ten tribes
for their ingratitude to God

101 Israel a vine full of branches the fruit is agreeable to it
according to the multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied altars
according to the plenty of his land he hath abounded with idols

102 Their heart is divided now they shall perish he shall break
down their idols he shall destroy their altars

103 For now they shall say We have no king because we fear not the
Lord and what shall a king do to us

104 You speak words of an unprofitable vision and you shall make a
covenant and judgment shall spring up as bitterness in the furrows of
the field

105 The inhabitants of Samaria have worshipped the kine of Bethaven
for the people thereof have mourned over it and the wardens of its
temple that rejoiced over it in its glory because it is departed from
it

The kine of Bethaven  The golden calves of Jeroboam

106 For itself also is carried into Assyria a present to the
avenging king shame shall fall upon Ephraim and Israel shall be
confounded in his own will

Itself also is carried etc  One of the golden calves was given by
king Manahem to Phul king of the Assyrians to engage him to stand by
him

107 Samaria hath made her king to pass as froth upon the face of the
water

108 And the high places of the idol the sin of Israel shall be
destroyed the bur and the thistle shall grow up over their altars and
they shall say to the mountains Cover us and to the hills Fall upon
us

109 From the days of Gabaa Israel hath sinned there they stood the
battle in Gabaa against the children of iniquity shall not overtake
them

1010 According to my desire I will chastise them and the nations
shall be gathered together against them when they shall be chastised
for their two iniquities

Their two iniquities  Their two calves

1011 Ephraim is a heifer taught to love to tread out corn but I
passed over upon the beauty of her neck I will ride upon Ephraim Juda
shall plough Jacob shall break the furrows for himself

1012 Sow for yourselves in justice and reap in the mouth of mercy
break up your fallow ground but the time to seek the Lord is when he
shall come that shall teach you justice

1013 You have ploughed wickedness you have reaped iniquity you have
eaten the fruit of lying because thou hast trusted in thy ways in the
multitude of thy strong ones

1014 A tumult shall arise among thy people and all thy fortresses
shall be destroyed as Salmana was destroyed by the house of him that
judged Baal in the day of battle the mother being dashed in pieces
upon her children

As Salmana king of the Midianites was destroyed by the house that
is by the followers of him that judged Baal that is of Gideon who
threw down the altar of Baal and was therefore called Jerubaal See
Judges 6 and 8

1015 So hath Bethel done to you because of the evil of your
iniquities



Osee Chapter 11


God proceeds in threatening Israel for their ingratitude yet he will
not utterly destroy them

111 As the morning passeth so hath the king of Israel passed away
Because Israel was a child and I loved him and I called my son out of
Egypt

I called my son  Viz Israel But as the calling of Israel out of
Egypt was a figure of the calling of Christ from thence therefore
this text is also applicable to Christ as we learn from Matthew 215

112 As they called them they went away from before their face they
offered victims to Baalim and sacrificed to idols

They called  Viz Moses and Aaron called but they went away after
other gods and would not hear

113 And I was like a foster father to Ephraim I carried them in my
arms and they knew not that I healed them

114 I will draw them with the cords of Adam with the bands of love
and I will be to them as one that taketh off the yoke on their jaws
and I put his meat to him that he might eat

115 He shall not return into the land of Egypt but the Assyrian
shall be his king because they would not be converted

116 The sword hath begun in his cities and it shall consume his
chosen men and shall devour their heads

117 And my people shall long for my return but a yoke shall be put
upon them together which shall not be taken off

118 How shall I deal with thee O Ephraim shall I protect thee O
Israel how shall I make thee as Adama shall I set thee as Seboim my
heart is turned within me my repentance is stirred up

Adama etc  Adama and Seboim were two cities in the neighborhood of
Sodom and underwent the like destruction

119 I will not execute the fierceness of my wrath I will not return
to destroy Ephraim because I am God and not man the holy one in the
midst of thee and I will not enter into the city

1110 They shall walk after the Lord he shall roar as a lion because
he shall roar and the children of the sea shall fear

1111 And they shall fly away like a bird out of Egypt and like a
dove out of the land of the Assyrians and I will place them in their
own houses saith the Lord

1112 Ephraim hath compassed me about with denials and the house of
Israel with deceit but Juda went down as a witness with God and is
faithful with the saints



Osee Chapter 12


Israel is reproved for sin Gods favours to them

121 Ephraim feedeth on the wind and followeth the burning heat all
the day long he multiplied lies and desolation and he hath made a
covenant with the Assyrians and carried oil into Egypt

122 Therefore there is a judgment of the Lord with Juda and a
visitation for Jacob he will render to him according to his ways and
according to his devices

123 In the womb he supplanted his brother and by his strength he had
success with an angel

124 And he prevailed over the angel and was strengthened he wept
and made supplication to him he found him in Bethel and there he
spoke with us

125 Even the Lord God of hosts the Lord is his memorial

126 Therefore turn thou to thy God keep mercy and judgment and hope
in thy God always

127 He is like Chanaan there is a deceitful balance in his hand he
hath loved oppression

128 And Ephraim said But yet I am become rich I have found me an
idol all my labours shall not find me the iniquity that I have
committed

129 And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
cause thee to dwell in tabernacles as in the days of the feast

1210 And I have spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied
visions and I have used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets

1211 If Galaad be an idol then in vain were they in Galgal offering
sacrifices with bullocks for their altars also are as heaps in the
furrows of the field

If Galaad be an idol etc  That is if Galaad with all its idols and
sacrifices be like a mere idol itself being brought to nothing by
Theglathphalasar how vain is it to expect that the idols worshipped
in Galgal shall be of any service to the tribes that remain

1212 Jacob fled into the country of Syria and Israel served for a
wife and was a keeper for a wife

1213 But the Lord by a prophet brought Israel out of Egypt and he
was preserved by a prophet

1214 Ephraim hath provoked me to wrath with his bitterness and his
blood shall come upon him and his Lord will render his reproach unto
him



Osee Chapter 13


The judgments of God upon Israel for their sins Christ shall one day
redeem them

131 When Ephraim spoke a horror seized Israel and he sinned in
Baal and died

132 And now they have sinned more and more and they have made to
themselves a molten thing of their silver as the likeness of idols the
whole is the work of craftsmen to these that say Sacrifice men ye
that adore calves

133 Therefore they shall be as a morning cloud and as the early dew
that passeth away as the dust that is driven with a whirlwind out of
the floor and as the smoke out of the chimney

134 But I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt and thou shalt
know no God but me and there is no saviour beside me

135 I knew thee in the desert in the land of the wilderness

136 According to their pastures they were filled and were made full
and they lifted up their heart and have forgotten me

137 And I will be to them as a lioness as a leopard in the way of
the Assyrians

138 I will meet them as a bear that is robbed of her whelps and I
will rend the inner parts of their liver and I will devour them there
as a lion the beast of the field shall tear them

139 Destruction is thy own O Israel thy help is only in me

1310 Where is thy king now especially let him save thee in all thy
cities and thy judges of whom thou saidst Give me kings and princes

1311 I will give thee a king in my wrath and will take him away in
my indignation

1312 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up his sin is hidden

1313 The sorrows of a woman in labour shall come upon him he is an
unwise son for now he shall not stand in the breach of the children

1314 I will deliver them out of the hand of death I will redeem them
from death O death I will be thy death O hell I will be thy bite
comfort is hidden from my eyes

1315 Because he shall make a separation between brothers the Lord
will bring a burning wind that shall rise from the desert and it shall
dry up his springs and shall make his fountain desolate and he shall
carry off the treasure of every desirable vessel



Osee Chapter 14


Samaria shall be destroyed An exhortation to repentance Gods favour
through Christ to the penitent

141 Let Samaria perish because she hath stirred up her God to
bitterness let them perish by the sword let their little ones be
dashed and let the women with child be ripped up

Perish because she hath stirred up her God to bitterness  It is not
a curse or imprecation but a prophecy of what should come to pass

142 Return O Israel to the Lord thy God for thou hast fallen down
by thy iniquity

143 Take with you words and return to the Lord and say to him Take
away all iniquity and receive the good and we will render the calves
of our lips

144 Assyria shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither
will we say any more The works of our hands are our gods for thou
wilt have mercy on the fatherless that is in thee

145 I will heal their breaches I will love them freely for my wrath
is turned away from them

146 I will be as the dew Israel shall spring as the lily and his
root shall shoot forth as that of Libanus

147 His branches shall spread and his glory shall be as the olive
tree and his smell as that of Libanus

148 They shall be converted that sit under his shadow they shall
live upon wheat and they shall blossom as a vine his memorial shall
be as the wine of Libanus

149 Ephraim shall say What have I to do any more with idols I will
hear him and I will make him flourish like a green fir tree from me
is thy fruit found

1410 Who is wise and he shall understand these things prudent and
he shall know these things for the ways of the Lord are right and the
just shall walk in them but the transgressors shall fall in them




THE PROPHECY OF JOEL



JOEL whose name according to ST JEROME signifies THE LORD GOD or
as others say THE COMING DOWN OF GOD prophesied about the same time
in the kingdom of Judea as OSEE did in the kingdom of Israel He
foretells under figure the great evils that were coming upon the people
for their sins earnestly exhorts them to repentance and comforts them
with the promise of a TEACHER OF JUSTICE viz CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD
and of the coming down of his holy SPIRIT



Joel Chapter 1


The prophet describes the judgments that shall fall upon the people
and invites them to fasting and prayer

11 The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Phatuel

12 Hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the
land did this ever happen in your days or in the days of your
fathers

13 Tell ye of this to your children and let your children tell their
children and their children to another generation

14 That which the palmerworm hath left the locust hath eaten and
that which the locust hath left the bruchus hath eaten and that which
the bruchus hath left the mildew hath destroyed

That which the palmerworm hath left etc  Some understand this
literally of the desolation of the land by these insects others
understand it of the different invasions of the Chaldeans or other
enemies

15 Awake ye that are drunk and weep and mourn all ye that take
delight in drinking sweet wine for it is cut off from your mouth

16 For a nation come up upon my land strong and without number his
teeth are like the teeth of a lion and his cheek teeth as of a lions
whelp

17 He hath laid my vineyard waste and hath pilled off the bark of my
fig tree he hath stripped it bare and cast it away the branches
thereof are made white

18 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her
youth

19 Sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of the Lord the
priests the Lords ministers have mourned

110 The country is destroyed the ground hath mourned for the corn
is wasted the wine is confounded the oil hath languished

111 The husbandmen are ashamed the vinedressers have howled for the
wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field is
perished

112 The vineyard is confounded and the fig tree hath languished the
pomegranate tree and the palm tree and the apple tree and all the
trees of the field are withered because joy is withdrawn from the
children of men

113 Gird yourselves and lament O ye priests howl ye ministers of
the altars go in lie in sackcloth ye ministers of my God because
sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of your God

114 Sanctify ye a fast call an assembly gather together the
ancients all the inhabitants of the land into the house of your God
and cry ye to the Lord

115 Ah ah ah for the day because the day of the Lord is at hand
and it shall come like destruction from the mighty

116 Is not your food cut off before your eyes joy and gladness from
the house of our God

117 The beasts have rotted in their dung the barns are destroyed
the storehouses are broken down because the corn is confounded

118 Why did the beasts groan why did the herds of cattle low
because there is no pasture for them yea and the flocks of sheep are
perished

119 To thee O Lord will I cry because fire hath devoured the
beautiful places of the wilderness and the flame hath burnt all the
trees of the country

120 Yea and the beasts of the field have looked up to thee as a
garden bed that thirsteth after rain for the springs of waters are
dried up and fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the
wilderness



Joel Chapter 2


21 Blow ye the trumpet in Sion sound an alarm in my holy mountain
let all the inhabitants of the land tremble because the day of the
Lord cometh because it is nigh at hand

The day of the Lord  That is the time when he will execute justice
upon sinners

22 A day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and
whirlwinds a numerous and strong people as the morning spread upon the
mountains the like to it hath not been from the beginning nor shall
be after it even to the years of generation and generation

A numerous and strong people  The Assyrians or Chaldeans Others
understand all this of an army of locusts laying waste the land

23 Before the face thereof a devouring fire and behind it a burning
flame the land is like a garden of pleasure before it and behind it a
desolate wilderness neither is there any one that can escape it

24 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and they
shall run like horsemen

25 They shall leap like the noise of chariots upon the tops of
mountains like the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble as
a strong people prepared to battle

26 At their presence the people shall be in grievous pains all faces
shall be made like a kettle

27 They shall run like valiant men like men of war they shall scale
the wall the men shall march every one on his way and they shall not
turn aside from their ranks

28 No one shall press upon his brother they shall walk every one in
his path yea and they shall fall through the windows and shall take
no harm

29 They shall enter into the city they shall run upon the wall they
shall climb up the houses they shall come in at the windows as a
thief

210 At their presence the earth hath trembled the heavens are moved
the sun and moon are darkened and the stars have withdrawn their
shining

211 And the Lord hath uttered his voice before the face of his army
for his armies are exceedingly great for they are strong and execute
his word for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible and who
can stand it

212 Now therefore saith the Lord Be converted to me with all your
heart in fasting and in weeping and mourning

213 And rend your hearts and not your garments and turn to the Lord
your God for he is gracious and merciful patient and rich in mercy
and ready to repent of the evil

214 Who knoweth but he will return and forgive and leave a blessing
behind him sacrifice and libation to the Lord your God

215 Blow the trumpet in Sion sanctify a fast call a solemn
assembly

216 Gather together the people sanctify the church assemble the
ancients gather together the little ones and them that suck at the
breasts let the bridegroom go forth from his bed and the bride out of
her bridal chamber

217 Between the porch and the altar the priests the Lords
ministers shall weep and shall say Spare O Lord spare thy people
and give not thy inheritance to reproach that the heathens should rule
over them Why should they say among the nations Where is their God

218 The Lord hath been zealous for his land and hath spared his
people

219 And the Lord answered and said to his people Behold I will send
you corn and wine and oil and you shall be filled with them and I
will no more make you a reproach among the nations

220 And I will remove far off from you the northern enemy and I will
drive him into a land unpassable and desert with his face towards the
east sea and his hinder part towards the utmost sea and his stench
shall ascend and his rottenness shall go up because he hath done
proudly

The northern enemy  Some understand this of Holofernes and his army
others of the locusts

221 Fear not O land be glad and rejoice for the Lord hath done
great things

222 Fear not ye beasts of the fields for the beautiful places of
the wilderness are sprung for the tree hath brought forth its fruit
the fig tree and the vine have yielded their strength

223 And you O children of Sion rejoice and be joyful in the Lord
your God because he hath given you a teacher of justice and he will
make the early and the latter rain to come down to you as in the
beginning

224 And the floors shall be filled with wheat and the presses shall
overflow with wine and oil

225 And I will restore to you the years which the locust and the
bruchus and the mildew and the palmerworm hath eaten my great host
which I sent upon you

226 And you shall eat in plenty and shall be filled and you shall
praise the name of the Lord your God who hath done wonders with you
and my people shall not be confounded for ever

227 And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and I am the
Lord your God and there is none besides and my people shall not be
confounded forever

228 And it shall come to pass after this that I will pour out my
spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy
your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions

229 Moreover upon my servants and handmaids in those days I will
pour forth my spirit

230 And I will shew wonders in heaven and in earth blood and fire
and vapour of smoke

231 The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood
before the great and dreadful day of the Lord doth come

232 And it shall come to pass that every one that shall call upon
the name of the Lord shall be saved for in Mount Sion and in
Jerusalem shall be salvation as the Lord hath said and in the residue
whom the Lord shall call



Joel Chapter 3


31 For behold in those days and in that time when I shall bring back
the captivity of Juda and Jerusalem

32 I will gather together all nations and will bring them down into
the valley of Josaphat and I will plead with them there for my people
and for my inheritance Israel whom they have scattered among the
nations and have parted my land

33 And they have cast lots upon my people and the boy they have put
in the stews and the girl they have sold for wine that they might
drink

34 But what have you to do with me O Tyre and Sidon and all the
coast of the Philistines will you revenge yourselves on me and if you
revenge yourselves on me I will very soon return you a recompense upon
your own head

35 For you have taken away my silver and my gold and my desirable
and most beautiful things you have carried into your temples

36 And the children of Juda and the children of Jerusalem you have
sold to the children of the Greeks that you might remove them far off
from their own country

37 Behold I will raise them up out of the place wherein you have
sold them and I will return your recompense upon your own heads

38 And I will sell your sons and your daughters by the hands of the
children of Juda and they shall sell them to the Sabeans a nation far
off for the Lord hath spoken it

39 Proclaim ye this among the nations Prepare war raise up the
strong let them come let all the men of war come up

310 Cut your ploughshares into swords and your spades into spears
Let the weak say I am strong

311 Break forth and come all ye nations from round about and
gather yourselves together there will the Lord cause all thy strong
ones to fall down

312 Let them arise and let the nations come up into the valley of
Josaphat for there I will sit to judge all nations round about

313 Put ye in the sickles for the harvest is ripe come and go down
for the press is full the fats run over for their wickedness is
multiplied

314 Nations nations in the valley of destruction for the day of the
Lord is near in the valley of destruction

315 The sun and the moon are darkened and the stars have withdrawn
their shining

316 And the Lord shall roar out of Sion and utter his voice from
Jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall be moved and the Lord
shall be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of
Israel

317 And you shall know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Sion
my holy mountain and Jerusalem shall be holy and strangers shall pass
through it no more

318 And it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall
drop down sweetness aud the hills shall flow with milk and waters
shall flow through all the rivers of Juda and a fountain shall come
forth of the house of the Lord and shall water the torrent of thorns

A fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord etc  Viz the
fountain of grace in the church militant and of glory in the church
triumphant which shall water the torrent or valley of thorns that is
the souls that before like barren ground brought forth nothing but
thorns or that were afflicted with the thorns of crosses and
tribulations

319 Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom a wilderness destroyed
because they have done unjustly against the children of Juda and have
shed innocent blood in their land

320 And Judea shall be inhabited for ever and Jerusalem to
generation and generation

Judeaand Jerusalem  That is the spiritual Jerusalem viz the
church of Christ

321 And I will cleanse their blood which I had not cleansed and the
Lord will dwell in Sion




THE PROPHECY OF AMOS



AMOS prophesied in Israel about the same time as OSEE and was called
from following the cattle to denounce GODS judgments to the people of
Israel and the neighbouring nations for their repeated crimes in
which they continued without repentance



Amos Chapter 1


The prophet threatens Damascus Gaza Tyre Edom and Ammon with the
judgments of God for their obstinacy in sin

11 The words of Amos who was among the herdsmen of Thecua which he
saw concerning Israel in the days of Ozias king of Juda and in the
days of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel two years before the
earthquake

The earthquake  Many understand this of a great earthquake which
they say was felt at the time that king Ozias attempted to offer
incense in the temple But the best chronologists prove that the
earthquake here spoken of must have been before that time because
Jeroboam the second under whom Amos prophesied was dead long before
that attempt of Ozias

12 And he said The Lord will roar from Sion and utter his voice
from Jerusalem and the beautiful places of the shepherds have mourned
and the top of Carmel is withered

13 Thus saith the Lord For three crimes of Damascus and for four I
will not convert it because they have thrashed Galaad with iron wains

For three crimesand for four  That is for their many unrepented of
crimesIbid I will not convert it  That is I will not spare them
nor turn away the punishments I design to inflict upon them

14 And I will send a fire into the house of Azael and it shall
devour the houses of Benadad

15 And I will break the bar of Damascus and I will cut off the
inhabitants from the plain of the idol and him that holdeth the
sceptre from the house of pleasure and the people of Syria shall be
carried away to Cyrene saith the Lord

16 Thus saith the Lord For three crimes of Gaza and for four I will
not convert it because they have carried away a perfect captivity to
shut them up in Edom

17 And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza and it shall devour
the houses thereof

18 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azotus and him that
holdeth the sceptre from Ascalon and I will turn my hand against
Accaron and the rest of the Philistines shall perish saith the Lord
God

19 Thus saith the Lord For three crimes of Tyre and for four I will
not convert it because they have shut up an entire captivity in Edom
and have not remembered the covenant of brethren

110 And I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre and it shall devour
the houses thereof

111 Thus saith the Lord For three crimes of Edom and for four I
will not convert him because he hath pursued his brother with the
sword and hath carried on his fury and hath kept his wrath to the
end

112 I will send a fire into Theman and it shall devour the houses of
Bosra

113 Thus saith the Lord For three crimes of the children of Ammon
and for four I will not convert him because he hath ripped up the
women with child of Galaad to enlarge his border

114 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabba and it shall
devour the houses thereof with shouting in the day of battle and with
a whirlwind in the day of trouble

115 And Melchom shall go into captivity both he and his princes
together saith the Lord

Melchom  The god or idol of the Ammonites otherwise called Moloch
and Melech which in Hebrew signifies a king and Melchom their king



Amos Chapter 2


The judgments with which God threatens Moab Juda and Israel for their
sins and their ingratitude

21 Thus saith the Lord For three crimes of Moab and for four I will
not convert him because he hath burnt the bones of the king of Edom
even to ashes

22 And I will send a fire into Moab and it shall devour the houses
of Carioth and Moab shall die with a noise with the sound of the
trumpet

23 And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof and will slay
all his princes with him saith the Lord

24 Thus saith the Lord For three crimes of Juda and for four I will
not convert him because he hath cast away the law of the Lord and
hath not kept his commandments for their idols have caused them to
err after which their fathers have walked

25 And I will send a fire into Juda and it shall devour the houses
of Jerusalem

26 Thus saith the Lord For three crimes of Israel and for four I
will not convert him because he hath sold the just man for silver and
the poor man for a pair of shoes

27 They bruise the heads of the poor upon the dust of the earth and
turn aside the way of the humble and the son and his father have gone
to the same young woman to profane my holy name

28 And they sat down upon garments laid to pledge by every altar and
drank the wine of the condemned in the house of their God

29 Yet I cast out the Amorrhite before their face whose height was
like the height of cedars and who was strong as an oak and I
destroyed his fruit from above and his roots beneath

210 It is I that brought you up out of the land of Egypt and I led
you forty years through the wilderness that you might possess the land
of the Amorrhite

211 And I raised up of your sons for prophets and of your young men
for Nazarites Is it not so O ye children of Israel saith the Lord

212 And you will present wine to the Nazarites and command the
prophets saying Prophesy not

213 Behold I will screak under you as a wain screaketh that is laden
with hay

I will screak  Unable to bear any longer the enormous load of your
sins etc The spirit of God as St Jerome takes notice accommodates
himself to the education of the prophet and inspires him with
comparisons taken from country affairs

214 And flight shall perish from the swift and the valiant shall not
possess his strength neither shall the strong save his life

215 And he that holdeth the bow shall not stand and the swift of
foot shall not escape neither shall the rider of the horse save his
life

216 And the stout of heart among the valiant shall flee away naked in
that day saith the Lord



Amos Chapter 3


The evils that shall fall upon Israel for their sins

31 Hear the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning you O ye
children of Israel concerning the whole family that I brought up out
of the land of Egypt saying

32 You only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore
will I visit upon you all your iniquities

Visit upon  That is punish

33 Shall two walk together except they be agreed

34 Will a lion roar in the forest if he have no prey will the
lions whelp cry out of his den if he have taken nothing

35 Will the bird fall into the snare upon the earth if there be no
fowler Shall the snare be taken up from the earth before it hath
taken somewhat

36 Shall the trumpet sound in a city and the people not be afraid
Shall there be evil in a city which the Lord hath not done

Evil in a city  He speaks of the evil of punishments of war famine
pestilence desolation etc but not of the evil of sin of which God
is not the author

37 For the Lord God doth nothing without revealing his secret to his
servants the prophets

38 The lion shall roar who will not fear The Lord God hath spoken
who shall not prophesy

39 Publish it in the houses of Azotus and in the houses of the land
of Egypt and say Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria
and behold the many follies in the midst thereof and them that suffer
oppression in the inner rooms thereof

310 And they have not known to do the right thing saith the Lord
storing up iniquity and robberies in their houses

311 Therefore thus saith the Lord God The land shall be in
tribulation and shall be compassed about and thy strength shall be
taken away from thee and thy houses shall be spoiled

312 Thus saith the Lord As if a shepherd should get out of the
lions mouth two legs or the tip of the ear so shall the children of
Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in a place of a bed and in
the couch of Damascus

313 Hear ye and testify in the house of Jacob saith the Lord the
God of hosts

314 That in the day when I shall begin to visit the transgressions of
Israel I will visit upon him and upon the altars of Bethel and the
horns of the altars shall be cut off and shall fall to the ground

315 And I will strike the winter house with the summer house and the
houses of ivory shall perish and many houses shall be destroyed saith
the Lord



Amos Chapter 4


The Israelites are reproved for their oppressing the poor for their
idolatry and their incorrigibleness

41 Hear this word ye fat kine that are in the mountains of Samaria
you that oppress the needy and crush the poor that say to your
masters Bring and we will drink

Fat kine  He means the great ones that lived in plenty and wealth

42 The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness that lo the days shall
come upon you when they shall lift you up on pikes and what shall
remain of you in boiling pots

43 And you shall go out at the breaches one over against the other
and you shall be cast forth into Armon saith the Lord

Armon  A foreign country some understand it of Armenia

44 Come ye to Bethel and do wickedly to Galgal and multiply
transgressions and bring in the morning your victims your tithes in
three days

45 And offer a sacrifice of praise with leaven and call free
offerings and proclaim it for so you would do O children of Israel
saith the Lord God

46 Whereupon I also have given you dulness of teeth in all your
cities and want of bread in all your places yet you have not returned
to me saith the Lord

47 I also have withholden the rain from you when there were yet
three months to the harvest and I caused it to rain upon on city and
caused it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained upon and
the piece whereupon I rained not withered

48 And two and three cities went to one city to drink water and were
not filled yet you returned not to me saith the Lord

49 I struck you with a burning wind and with mildew the palmerworm
hath eaten up your many gardens and your vineyards your olive groves
and fig groves yet you returned not to me saith the Lord

410 I sent death upon you in the way of Egypt I slew your young men
with the sword even to the captivity of your horses and I made the
stench of your camp to come up into your nostrils yet you returned not
to me saith the Lord

411 I destroyed some of you as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha and
you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning yet you returned
not to me saith the Lord

412 Therefore I will do these things to thee O Israel and after I
shall have done these things to thee be prepared to meet thy God O
Israel

413 For behold he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind
and declareth his word to man he that maketh the morning mist and
walketh upon the high places of the earth the Lord the God of hosts is
his name



Amos Chapter 5


A lamentation for Israel an exhortation to return to God

51 Hear ye this word which I take up concerning you for a
lamentation The house of Israel is fallen and it shall rise no more

52 The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land there is none to
raise her up

53 For thus saith the Lord God The city out of which came forth a
thousand there shall be left in it a hundred and out of which there
came a hundred there shall be left in it ten in the house of Israel

54 For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel Seek ye me and
you shall live

55 But seek not Bethel and go not into Galgal neither shall you
pass over to Bersabee for Galgal shall go into captivity and Bethel
shall be unprofitable

BethelGalgalBersabee  The places where they worshipped their
idols

56 Seek ye the Lord and live lest the house of Joseph be burnt with
fire and it shall devour and there shall be none to quench Bethel

57 You that turn judgment into wormwood and forsake justice in the
land

58 Seek him that maketh Arcturus and Orion and that turneth
darkness into morning and that changeth day into night that calleth
the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth
The Lord is his name

Arcturus and Orion  Arcturus is a bright star in the north Orion a
beautiful constellation in the south

59 He that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the strong and
waste upon the mighty

With a smile  That is with all ease and without making any effort

510 They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate and have abhorred
him that speaketh perfectly

511 Therefore because you robbed the poor and took the choice prey
from him you shall build houses with square stone and shall not dwell
in them you shall plant most delightful vineyards and shall not drink
the wine of them

512 Because I know your manifold crimes and your grievous sins
enemies of the just taking bribes and oppressing the poor in the
gate

513 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time for it is
an evil time

514 Seek ye good and not evil that you may live and the Lord the
God of hosts will be with you as you have said

515 Hate evil and love good and establish judgment in the gate it
may be the Lord the God of hosts may have mercy on the remnant of
Joseph

516 Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the sovereign
Lord In every street there shall be wailing and in all places that
are without they shall say Alas alas and they shall call the
husbandman to mourning and such as are skilful in lamentation to
lament

517 And in all vineyards there shall be wailing because I will pass
through in the midst of thee saith the Lord

518 Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord to what end is it
for you the day of the Lord is darkness and not light

519 As if a man should flee from the face of a lion and a bear
should meet him or enter into the house and lean with his hand upon
the wall and a serpent should bite him

520 Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness and not light and
obscurity and no brightness in it

521 I hate and have rejected your festivities and I will not
receive the odour of your assemblies

522 And if you offer me holocausts and your gifts I will not
receive them neither will I regard the vows of your fat beasts

523 Take away from me the tumult of thy songs and I will not hear
the canticles of thy harp

524 But judgment shall be revealed as water and justice as a mighty
torrent

525 Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for
forty years O house of Israel

Did you offer etc  Except the sacrifices that were offered at the
first in the dedication of the tabernacle the Israelites offered no
sacrifices in the desert

526But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch and the image of
your idols the star of your god which you made to yourselves

A tabernacle etc  All this alludes to the idolatry which they
committed when they were drawn away by the daughters of Moab to the
worship of their gods Num 25

527 And I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus saith
the Lord the God of hosts is his name



Amos Chapter 6


The desolation of Israel for their pride and luxury

61 Woe to you that are wealthy in Sion and to you that have
confidence in the mountain of Samaria ye great men heads of the
people that go in with state into the house of Israel

62 Pass ye over to Chalane and see and go from thence into Emath
the great and go down into Geth of the Philistines and to all the
best kingdoms of these if their border be larger than your border

63 You that are separated unto the evil day and that approach to the
throne of iniquity

64 You that sleep upon beds of ivory and are wanton on your couches
that eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of
the herd

65 You that sing to the sound of the psaltery they have thought
themselves to have instruments of music like David

66 That drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the best
ointments and they are not concerned for the affliction of Joseph

67 Wherefore now they shall go captive at the head of them that go
into captivity and the faction of the luxurious ones shall be taken
away

68 The Lord God hath sworn by his own soul saith the Lord the God of
hosts I detest the pride of Jacob and I hate his houses and I will
deliver up the city with the inhabitants thereof

69 And if there remain ten men in one house they also shall die

610 And a mans kinsman shall take him up and shall burn him that
he may carry the bones out of the house and he shall say to him that
is in the inner rooms of the house Is there yet any with thee

611 And he shall answer There is an end And he shall say to him
Hold thy peace and mention not the name of the Lord

612 For behold the Lord hath commanded and he will strike the
greater house with breaches and the lesser house with clefts

613 Can horses run upon the rocks or can any one plough with
buffles for you have turned judgment into bitterness and the fruit of
justice into wormwood

614 You that rejoice in a thing of nought you that say Have we not
taken unto us horns by our own strength

615 But behold I will raise up a nation against you O house of
Israel saith the Lord the God of hosts and they shall destroy you
from the entrance of Emath even to the torrent of the desert



Amos Chapter 7


The prophet sees in three visions evils coming upon Israel he is
accused of treason by the false priest of Bethel

71 These things the Lord God shewed to me and behold the locust was
formed in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter rain and lo
it was the latter rain after the kings mowing

The locust etc  These judgments by locusts and fire which by the
prophets intercession were moderated signify the former invasions of
the Assyrians under Phul and Theglathphalasar before the utter
desolation of Israel by Salmanasar

72 And it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the
grass of the land I said O Lord God be merciful I beseech thee who
shall raise up Jacob for he is very little

73 The Lord had pity upon this It shall not be said the Lord

74 These things the Lord God shewed to me and behold the Lord called
for judgment unto fire and it devoured the great deep and ate up a
part at the same time

75 And I said O Lord God cease I beseech thee who shall raise up
Jacob for he is a little one

76 The Lord had pity upon this Yea this also shall not be said the
Lord God

77 These things the Lord shewed to me and behold the Lord was
standing upon a plastered wall and in his hand a masons trowel

78 And the Lord said to me What seest thou Amos And I said A
masons trowel And the Lord said Behold I will lay down the trowel
in the midst of my people Israel I will plaster them over no more

79 And the high places of the idol shall be thrown down and the
sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste and I will rise up against
the house of Jeroboam with the sword

710 And Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel
saying Amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the house of
Israel the land is not able to bear all his words

711 For thus saith Amos Jeroboam shall die by the sword and Israel
shall be carried away captive out of their own land

Jeroboam shall die by the sword  The prophet did not say this but
that the Lord would rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the
sword which was verified when Zacharias the son and successor of
Jeroboam was slain by the sword 4 Kings 1510

712 And Amasias said to Amos Thou seer go flee away into the land
of Juda and eat bread there and prophesy there

713 But prophesy not again any more in Bethel because it is the
kings sanctuary and it is the house of the kingdom

714 And Amos answered and said to Amasias I am not a prophet nor am
I the son of a prophet but I am a herdsman plucking wild figs

I am not a prophet  That is I am not a prophet by education nor is
prophesying my calling or profession but I am a herdsman whom God was
pleased to send hither to prophesy to Israel

715 And the Lord took me when I followed the flock and the Lord said
to me Go prophesy to my people Israel

716 And now hear thou the word of the Lord Thou sayest thou shalt
not prophesy against Israel and thou shalt not drop thy word upon the
house of the idol

The house of the idol  Viz of the calf worshipped in Bethel

717 Therefore thus saith the Lord Thy wife shall play the harlot in
the city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword and
thy land shall be measured by a line and thou shalt die in a polluted
land and Israel shall go into captivity out of their land



Amos Chapter 8


Under the figure of a hook which bringeth down the fruit the
approaching desolation of Israel is foreshewed for their avarice and
injustices

81 These things the Lord shewed to me and behold a hook to draw down
the fruit

82 And he said What seest thou Amos And I said A hook to draw
down fruit And the Lord said to me The end is come upon my people
Israel I will not again pass by them any more

83 And the hinges of the temple shall screak in that day saith the
Lord God many shall die silence shall be cast in every place

84 Hear this you that crush the poor and make the needy of the land
to fail

85 Saying When will the month be over and we shall sell our wares
and the sabbath and we shall open the corn that we may lessen the
measure and increase the sicle and may convey in deceitful balances

86 That we may possess the needy for money and the poor for a pair
of shoes and may sell the refuse of the corn

87 The Lord hath sworn against the pride of Jacob surely I will
never forget all their works

88 Shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that
dwelleth therein and rise up altogether as a river and be cast out
and run down as the river of Egypt

89 And it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord God that
the sun shall go down at midday and I will make the earth dark in the
day of light

810 And I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs
into lamentation and I will bring up sackcloth upon every back of
yours and baldness upon every head and I will make it as the mourning
of an only son and the latter end thereof as a bitter day

811 Behold the days come saith the Lord and I will send forth a
famine into the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst of water but
of hearing the word of the Lord

812 And they shall move from sea to sea and from the north to the
east they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord and shall not
find it

813 In that day the fair virgins and the young men shall faint for
thirst

814 They that swear by the sin of Samaria and say Thy God O Dan
liveth and the way of Bersabee liveth and they shall fall and shall
rise no more



Amos Chapter 9


The certainty of the desolation of Israel the restoring of the
tabernacle of David and the conversion of the Gentiles to the church
which shall flourish for ever

91 I saw the Lord standing upon the altar and he said Strike the
hinges and let the lintels be shook for there is covetousness in the
head of them all and I will slay the last of them with the sword
there shall be no flight for them they shall flee and he that shall
flee of them shall not be delivered

92 Though they go down even to hell thence shall my hand bring them
out and though they climb up to heaven thence will I bring them down

93 And though they be hid in the top of Carmel I will search and
take them away from thence and though they hide themselves from my
eyes in the depth of the sea there will I command the serpent and he
shall bite them

94 And if they go into captivity before their enemies there will I
command the sword and it shall kill them And I will set my eyes upon
them for evil and not for good

95 And the Lord the God of hosts is he who toucheth the earth and it
shall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall rise
up as a river and shall run down as the river of Egypt

96 He that buildeth his ascension in heaven and hath founded his
bundle upon the earth who calleth the waters of the sea and poureth
them out upon the face of the earth the Lord is his name

His ascension  That is his high throneIbid His bundle  That
is his church bound up together by the bands of one faith and communion

97 Are not you as the children of the Ethiopians unto me O children
of Israel saith the Lord did not I bring up Israel out of the land
of Egypt and the Philistines out of Cappadocia and the Syrians out of
Cyrene

As the children of the Ethiopians  That is as black as they by your
iniquities

98 Behold the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom and I
will destroy it from the face of the earth but yet I will not utterly
destroy the house of Jacob saith the Lord

99 For behold I will command and I will sift the house of Israel
among all nations as corn is sifted in a sieve and there shall not a
little stone fall to the ground

910 All the sinners of my people shall fall by the sword who say
The evils shall not approach and shall not come upon us

911 In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is
fallen and I will close up the breaches of the walls thereof and
repair what was fallen and I will rebuild it as in the days of old

912 That they may possess the remnant of Edom and all nations
because my name is invoked upon them saith the Lord that doth these
things

913 Behold the days come saith the Lord when the ploughman shall
overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed
and the mountains shall drop sweetness and every hill shall be tilled

Shall overtake etc  By this is meant the great abundance of
spiritual blessings which as it were by a constant succession shall
enrich the church of Christ

914 And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel and they
shall build the abandoned cities and inhabit them and they shall
plant vineyards and drink the wine of them and shall make gardens
and eat the fruits of them And I will plant them upon their own land
and I will no more pluck them out of their land which I have given
them saith the Lord thy God




THE PROPHECY OF ABDIAS



ABDIAS whose name is interpreted THE SERVANT OF THE LORD is believed
to have prophesied about the same time as OSEE JOEL and AMOS though
some of the Hebrews who believe him to be the same with ACHABs
steward make him much more ancient His prophecy is the shortest of
any in number of words but yields to none says ST JEROME in the
sublimity of mysteries It contains but one chapter



Abdias Chapter 1


The destruction of Edom for their pride and the wrongs they did to
Jacob the salvation and victory of Israel

11 The vision of Abdias Thus saith the Lord God to Edom We have
heard a rumour from the Lord and he hath sent an ambassador to the
nations Arise and let us rise up to battle against him

12 Behold I have made thee small among the nations thou art
exceeding contemptible

13 The pride of thy heart hath lifted thee up who dwellest in the
clefts of the rocks and settest up thy throne on high who sayest in
thy heart Who shall bring me down to the ground

14 Though thou be exalted as an eagle and though thou set thy nest
among the stars thence will I bring thee down saith the Lord

15 If thieves had gone in to thee if robbers by night how wouldst
thou have held thy peace would they not have stolen till they had
enough if the grapegatherers had come in to thee would they not have
left thee at the least a cluster

16 How have they searched Esau how have they sought out his hidden
things

17 They have sent thee out even to the border all the men of thy
confederacy have deceived thee the men of thy peace have prevailed
against thee they that eat with thee shall lay snares under thee
there is no wisdom in him

18 Shall not I in that day saith the Lord destroy the wise out of
Edom and understanding out of the mount of Esau

19 And thy valiant men of the south shall be afraid that man may be
cut off from the mount of Esau

110 For the slaughter and for the iniquity against thy brother
Jacob confusion shall cover thee and thou shalt perish for ever

111 In the day when thou stoodest against him when strangers carried
away his army captive and foreigners entered into his gates and cast
lots upon Jerusalem thou also wast as one of them

112 But thou shalt not look on in the day of thy brother in the day
of his leaving his country and thou shalt not rejoice over the
children of Juda in the day of their destruction and thou shalt not
magnify thy mouth in the day of distress

Thou shalt not look etc  or thou shouldst not etc It is a
reprehension for what they had done and at the same time a declaration
that these things should not pass unpunishedIbid Thou shalt not
magnify thy mouth  That is thou shalt not speak arrogantly against
the children of Juda as insulting them in their distress

113 Neither shalt thou enter into the gate of my people in the day of
their ruin neither shalt thou also look on in his evils in the day of
his calamity and thou shalt not be sent out against his army in the
day of his desolation

114 Neither shalt thou stand in the crossways to kill them that flee
and thou shalt not shut up them that remain of him in the day of
tribulation

115 For the day of the Lord is at hand upon all nations as thou hast
done so shall it be done to thee he will turn thy reward upon thy own
head

116 For as you have drunk upon my holy mountain so all nations shall
drink continually and they shall drink and sup up and they shall be
as though they were not

117 And in mount Sion shall be salvation and it shall be holy and
the house of Jacob shall possess those that possessed them

118 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire and the house of Joseph a
flame and the house of Esau stubble and they shall be kindled in
them and shall devour them and there shall be no remains of the house
of Esau for the Lord hath spoken it

119 And they that are toward the south shall inherit the mount of
Esau and they that are in the plains the Philistines and they shall
possess the country of Ephraim and the country of Samaria and
Benjamin shall possess Galaad

120 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel all the
places of the Chanaanites even to Sarepta and the captivity of
Jerusalem that is in Bosphorus shall possess the cities of the south

121 And saviours shall come up into mount Sion to judge the mount of
Esau and the kingdom shall be for the Lord




THE PROPHECY OF JONAS



JONAS prophesied in the reign of JEREBOAM the second as we learn from
4 Kings 1425 To whom also he foretold his success in restoring all
the borders of Israel He was of GETH OPHER in the tribe of ZABULON
and consequently of GALILEE which confutes that assertion of the
Pharisees John 752 that no prophet ever rose out of GALILEE He
prophesied and prefigured in his own person the death and resurrection
of CHRIST and was the only one among the prophets that was sent to
preach to the Gentiles



Jonas Chapter 1


Jonas being sent to preach in Ninive fleeth away by sea a tempest
riseth of which he being found by lot to be the cause is cast into
the sea which thereupon is calmed

11 Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi saying

12 Arise and go to Ninive the great city and preach in it For the
wickedness thereof is come up before me

Nineve  The capital city of the Assyrian empire

13 And Jonas rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the Lord
and he went down to Joppe and found a ship going to Tharsis and he
paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them to
Tharsis from the face of the Lord

Tharsis  Which some take to be Tharsus of Cilicia others to be
Tartessus of Spain others to be Carthage

14 But the Lord sent a great wind to the sea and a great tempest was
raised in the sea and the ship was in danger to be broken

15 And the mariners were afraid and the men cried to their god and
they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to
lighten it of them and Jonas went down into the inner part of the
ship and fell into a deep sleep

A deep sleep  This is a lively image of the insensibility of sinners
fleeing from God and threatened on every side with his judgments and
yet sleeping as if they were secure

16 And the ship master came to him and said to him Why art thou fast
asleep rise up call upon thy God if so be that God will think of us
that we may not perish

17 And they said every one to his fellow Come and let us cast lots
that we may know why this evil is upon us And they cast lots and the
lot fell upon Jonas

18 And they said to him Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us
what is thy business of what country art thou and whither goest thou
or of what people art thou

19 And he said to them I am a Hebrew and I fear the Lord and the
God of heaven who made both the sea and the dry land

110 And the men were greatly afraid and they said to him Why hast
thou done this For the men knew that he fled from the face of the
Lord because he had told them

111 And they said to him What shall we do with thee that the sea
may be calm to us for the sea flowed and swelled

112 And he said to them take me up and cast me into the sea and
the sea shall be calm to you for I know for my sake this great tempest
is upon you

113 And the men rowed hard to return the land but they were not
able because the sea tossed and swelled upon them

114 And they cried to the Lord and said We beseech thee O Lord let
us not perish for this mans life and lay not upon us innocent blood
for thou oh Lord hast done as it pleased thee

115 And they took Jonas and cast him into the sea and the sea
ceased from raging

116 And the men feared the Lord exceedingly and sacrificed victims
to the Lord and made vows



Jonas Chapter 2


Jonas is swallowed up by a great fish he prayeth with confidence in
God and the fish casteth him out on the dry land

21 Now the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonas and Jonas
was in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights

22 And Jonas prayed to the Lord his God out of the belly of the
fish

23 And he said I cried out of my affliction to the Lord and he
heard me I cried out of the belly of hell and thou hast heard my
voice

24 And thou hast cast me forth into the deep in the heart of the
sea and a flood hast compassed me all thy billows and thy waves have
passed over me

25 And I said I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes but yet I
shall see the holy temple again

26 The waters compassed me about even to the soul the deep hath
closed me round about the sea hath covered my head

27 I went down to the lowest parts of the mountains the bars of the
earth have shut me up for ever and thou wilt bring up my life from
corruption O Lord my God

28 When my soul was in distress within me I remembered the Lord
that my prayer may come to thee unto the holy temple

29 They that in vain observe vanities forsake their own mercy

210 But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee I will pay
whatsoever I have vowed for my salvation to the Lord

211 And the Lord spoke to the fish and it vomited out Jonas upon the
dry land

Spoke to the fish  Gods speaking to the fish was nothing else but
his will which all things obey



Jonas Chapter 3


Jonas is sent again to preach in Ninive Upon their fasting and
repentance God recalleth the sentence by which they were to be
destroyed

31 And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the second time saying

32 Arise and go to Ninive the great city and preach in it the
preaching that I bid thee

33 And Jonas arose and went to Ninive according to the word of the
Lord now Ninive was a great city of three days journey

Of three days journey  By the computation of some ancient
historians Ninive was about fifty miles round so that to go through
all the chief streets and public places was three days journey

34 And Jonas began to enter into the city one days journey and he
cried and said Yet forty days and Ninive shall be destroyed

35 And the men of Ninive believed in God and they proclaimed a fast
and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least

36 And the word came to the king of Ninive and he rose up out of his
throne and cast away his robe from him and was clothed in sackcloth
and sat in ashes

37 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published in Ninive from
the mouth of the king and of his princes saying Let neither men nor
beasts oxen nor sheep taste anything let them not feed nor drink
water

38 And let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth and cry to the
Lord with all their strength and let them turn every one from his evil
way and from the iniquity that is in their hands

39 Who can tell if God will turn and forgive and will turn away
from his fierce anger and we shall not perish

310 And God saw their works that they were turned from their evil
way and God had mercy with regard to the evil which he had said that
he would do to them and he did it not



Jonas Chapter 4


41 And Jonas was exceedingly troubled and was angry

Was exceedingly troubled etc  His concern was lest he should pass
for a false prophet or rather lest Gods word by this occasion
might come to be slighted and disbelieved

42 And he prayed to the Lord and said I beseech thee O Lord is
not this what I said when I was yet in my own country therefore I
went before to flee into Tharsis for I know that thou art a gracious
and merciful God patient and of much compassion and easy to forgive
evil

43 And now O Lord I beseech thee take my life from me for it is
better for me to die than to live

44 And the Lord said Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry

45 Then Jonas went out of the city and sat toward the east side of
the city and he made himself a booth there and he sat under it in the
shadow till he might see what would befall the city

46 And the Lord God prepared an ivy and it came up over the head of
Jonas to be a shadow over his head and to cover him for he was
fatigued and Jonas was exceeding glad of the ivy

The Lord God prepared an ivy  Hederam In the Hebrew it is Kikajon
which some render a gourd others a palmerist or palma Christi

47 But God prepared a worm when the morning arose on the following
day and it struck the ivy and it withered

48 And when the sun was risen the Lord commanded a hot and burning
wind and the sun beat upon the head of Jonas and he broiled with the
heat and he desired for his soul that he might die and said It is
better for me to die than to live

49 And the Lord said to Jonas Dost thou think thou hast reason to be
angry for the ivy And he said I am angry with reason even unto
death

410 And the Lord said Thou art grieved for the ivy for which thou
hast not laboured nor made it to grow which in one night came up and
in one night perished

411 And shall I not spare Ninive that great city in which there are
more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that know not how to
distinguish between their right hand and their left and many beasts




THE PROPHECY OF MICHEAS



MICHEAS of Morasti a little town in the tribe of JUDA was
contemporary with the prophet ISAIAS whom he resembles both in his
spirit and his style He is different from the prophet MICHEAS
mentioned in the third book of Kings chap 22 For that MICHEAS lived
in the days of king ACHAB one hundred and fifty years before the time
of EZECHIAS under whom this MICHEAS prophesied



Micheas Chapter 1


Samaria for her sins shall be destroyed by the Assyrians they shall
also invade Juda and Jerusalem

11 The word of the Lord that came to Micheas the Morasthite in the
days of Joathan Achaz and Ezechias kings of Juda which he saw
concerning Samaria and Jerusalem

12 Hear all ye people and let the earth give ear and all that is
therein and let the Lord God be a witness to you the Lord from his
holy temple

13 For behold the Lord will come forth out of his place and he will
come down and will tread upon the high places of the earth

14 And the mountains shall be melted under him and the valleys shall
be cleft as wax before the fire and as waters that run down a steep
place

15 For the wickedness of Jacob is all this and for the sins of the
house of Israel What is the wickedness of Jacob is it not Samaria
and what are the high places of Juda are they not Jerusalem

16 And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a
vineyard is planted and I will bring down the stones thereof into the
valley and will lay her foundations bare

17 And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces and all her
wages shall be burnt with fire and I will bring to destruction all her
idols for they were gathered together of the hire of a harlot and
unto the hire of a harlot they shall return

Her wages  That is her donaries or presents offered to her idols or
the hire of all her traffic and labourIbid Of the hire of a harlot
etc  They were gathered together by one idolatrous city viz
Samaria and they shall be carried away to another idolatrous city
viz Ninive

18 Therefore will I lament and howl I will go stript and naked I
will make a wailing like the dragons and a mourning like the
ostriches

19 Because her wound is desperate because it is come even to Juda
it hath touched the gate of my people even to Jerusalem

It hath touched the gate etc  That is the destruction of Samaria
shall be followed by the invasion of my people of Juda and the
Assyrians shall come and lay all waste even to the confines of
Jerusalem

110 Declare ye it not in Geth weep ye not with tears in the house
of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust

Declare ye it not in Geth  Viz amongst the Philistines lest they
rejoice at your calamityIbid Weep ye not etc  Keep in your
tears that you may not give your enemies an occasion of insulting over
you but in your own houses or in your house of dust your earthly
habitation sprinkle yourselves with dust and put on the habit of
penitents Some take the house of dust in Hebrew Aphrah to be the
proper name of a city

111 And pass away O thou that dwellest in the beautiful place
covered with thy shame she went not forth that dwelleth in the
confines the house adjoining shall receive mourning from you which
stood by herself

Thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place viz in Samaria In the
Hebrew the Beautiful place is expressed by the word Sapir which some
take for the proper name of a cityIbid She went not forth
etc  that is they that dwelt in the confines came not forth but kept
themselves within for fearIbid The house adjoining etc  Viz
Judea and Jerusalem neighbours to Samaria and partners in her sins
shall share also in her mourning and calamity though they have
pretended to stand by themselves trusting in their strength

112 For she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in bitterness for
evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem

She is become weak etc  Jerusalem is become weak unto any good
because she dwells in the bitterness of sin

113 A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis
it is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Sion for in thee were
found the crimes of Israel

It is the beginning etc  That is Lachis was the first city of Juda
that learned from Samaria the worship of idols and communicated it to
Jerusalem

114 Therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of Geth
the houses of lying to deceive the kings of Israel

Therefore shall she send etc  Lachis shall send to Geth for help
but in vain for Geth instead of helping shall be found to be a house
of lying and deceit to Israel

115 Yet will I bring an heir to thee that dwellest in Maresa even to
Odollam shall the glory of Israel come

An heir etc  Maresa which was the name of a city of Juda signifies
inheritance but here God by his prophet tells the Jews that he will
bring them an heir to take possession of their inheritance and that
the glory of Israel shall be obliged to give place and to retire even
to Odollam a city in the extremity of their dominions And therefore
he exhorts them to penance in the following verse

116 Make thee bald and be polled for thy delicate children enlarge
thy baldness as the eagle for they are carried into captivity from
thee



Micheas Chapter 2


The Israelites by their crying injustices provoke God to punish them
He shall at last restore Jacob

21 Woe to you that devise that which is unprofitable and work evil
in your beds in the morning light they execute it because their hand
is against God

22 And they have coveted fields and taken them by violence and
houses they have forcibly taken away and oppressed a man and his
house a man and his inheritance

23 Therefore thus saith the Lord Behold I devise an evil against
this family from which you shall not withdraw your necks and you
shall not walk haughtily for this is a very evil time

24 In that day a parable shall be taken up upon you and a song shall
be sung with melody by them that say We are laid waste and spoiled
the portion of my people is changed how shall he depart from me
whereas he is returning that will divide our land

How shall he depart etc  How do you pretend to say that the Assyrian
is departing when indeed he is coming to divide our lands amongst his
subjects

25 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the cord of a lot
in the assembly of the Lord

Thou shalt have none etc  Thou shalt have no longer any lot or
inheritance in the land of the people of the Lord

26 Speak ye not saying It shall not drop upon these confusion
shall not take them

It shall not drop etc  That is the prophecy shall not come upon
these Such were the sentiments of the people that were unwilling to
believe the threats of the prophets

27 The house of Jacob saith Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened or
are these his thoughts Are not my words good to him that walketh
uprightly

28 But my people on the contrary are risen up as an enemy you have
taken away the cloak off from the coat and them that passed harmless
you have turned to war

You have taken away etc  You have even stripped people of their
necessary garments and have treated such as were innocently passing on
the way as if they were at war with you

29 You have cast out the women of my people from their houses in
which they took delight you have taken my praise forever from their
children

You have cast out etc  either by depriving them of their houses or
by your crimes given occasion to their being carried away captives
and their children by that means never learning to praise the Lord

210 Arise ye and depart for there is no rest here for you For that
uncleanness of the land it shall be corrupted with a grievous
corruption

211 Would God I were not a man that hath the spirit and that I
rather spoke a lie I will let drop to thee of wine and of
drunkenness and it shall be this people upon whom it shall drop

Would God etc  The prophet could have wished out of his love to his
people that he might be deceived in denouncing to them these evils
that were to fall upon them but by conforming himself to the will of
God he declares to them that he is sent to prophesy literally to let
drop upon them the wine of Gods indignation with which they should
be made drunk that is stupified and cast down

212 I will assemble and gather together all of thee O Jacob I will
bring together the remnant of Israel I will put them together as a
flock in the fold as sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes they shall
make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men

213 For he shall go up that shall open the way before them they
shall divide and pass through the gate and shall come in by it and
their king shall pass before them and the Lord at the head of them



Micheas Chapter 3


For the sins of the rich oppressing the poor of false prophets
flattering for lucre and of judges perverting justice Jerusalem and
the temple shall be destroyed

31 And I said Hear O ye princes of Jacob and ye chiefs of the
house of Israel Is it not your part to know judgment

32 You that hate good and love evil that violently pluck off their
skins from them and their flesh from their bones

33 Who have eaten the flesh of my people and have flayed their skin
off them and have broken and chopped their bones as for the kettle
and as flesh in the midst of the pot

34 Then shall they cry to the Lord and he will not hear them and he
will hide his face from them at that time as they have behaved
wickedly in their devices

35 Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people
err that bite with their teeth and preach peace and if a man give
not something into their mouth they prepare war against him

36 Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision and darkness to
you instead of divination and the sun shall go down upon the prophets
and the day shall be darkened over them

37 And they shall be confounded that see visions and the diviners
shall be confounded and they shall all cover their faces because
there is no answer of God

38 But yet I am filled with the strength of the spirit of the Lord
with judgment and power to declare unto Jacob his wickedness and to
Israel his sin

39 Hear this ye princes of the house of Jacob and ye judges of the
house of Israel you that abhor judgment and pervert all that is right

310 You that build up Sion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity

311 Her princes have judged for bribes and her priests have taught
for hire and her prophets divined for money and they leaned upon the
Lord saying Is not the Lord in the midst of us no evil shall come
among us

312 Therefore because of you Sion shall be ploughed as a field and
Jerusalem shall be as a heap of stones and the mountain of the temple
as the high places of the forests



Micheas Chapter 4


The glory of the church of Christ by the conversion of the Gentiles
The Jews shall be carried captives to Babylon and be delivered again

41 And it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of
the house of the Lord shall be prepared in the top of the mountains
and high above the hills and people shall flow to it

42 And many nations shall come in haste and say Come let us go up
to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob and
he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for the
law shall go forth out of Sion and the word of the Lord out of
Jerusalem

43 And he shall judge among many people and rebuke strong nations
afar off and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their
spears into spades nation shall not take sword against nation neither
shall they learn war anymore

Neither shall they learn etc  The law of Christ is a law of peace
and all his true subjects as much as lies in them love and keep peace
with all the world

44 And every man shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree
and there shall be none to make them afraid for the mouth of the Lord
of hosts hath spoken

45 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god but we
will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever

46 In that day saith the Lord I will gather up her that halteth
and her that I had cast out I will gather up and her whom I had
afflicted

47 And I will make her that halted a remnant and her that had been
afflicted a mighty nation and the Lord will reign over them in Mount
Sion from this time now and forever

48 And thou O cloudy tower of the flock of the daughter of Sion
unto thee shall it come yea the first power shall come the kingdom to
the daughter of Jerusalem

49 Now why art thou drawn together with grief Hast thou no king in
thee or is thy counselor perished because sorrow hath taken thee as a
woman in labour

410 Be in pain and labour O daughter of Sion as a woman that
bringeth forth for now shalt thou go out of the city and shalt dwell
in the country and shalt come even to Babylon there thou shalt be
delivered there the Lord will redeem thee out of the hand of thy
enemies

411 And now many nations are gathered together against thee and they
say Let her be stoned and let our eye look upon Sion

412 But they have not known the thoughts of the Lord and have not
understood his counsel because he hath gathered them together as the
hay of the floor

413 Arise and tread O daughter of Sion for I will make thy horn
iron and thy hoofs I will make brass and thou shalt beat in pieces
many peoples and shalt immolate the spoils of them to the Lord and
their strength to the Lord of the whole earth



Micheas Chapter 5


The birth of Christ in Bethlehem his reign and spiritual conquests

51 Now shalt thou be laid waste O daughter of the robber they have
laid siege against us with a rod shall they strike the cheek of the
judge of Israel

Daughter of the robber  Some understand this of Babylon which robbed
and pillaged the temple of God others understand it of Jerusalem by
reason of the many rapines and oppressions committed there

52 And thou Bethlehem Ephrata art a little one among the thousands
of Juda out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be the
ruler in Israel and his going forth is from the beginning from the
days of eternity

His going forth etc  That is he who as man shall be born in thee
as God was born of his Father from all eternity

53 Therefore will he give them up even till the time wherein she that
travaileth shall bring forth and the remnant of his brethren shall be
converted to the children of Israel

54 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord in the
height of the name of the Lord his God and they shall be converted
for now shall he be magnified even to the ends of the earth

55 And this man shall be our peace when the Assyrian shall come into
our land and when he shall set his foot in our houses and we shall
raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men

The Assyrian  That is the persecutors of the church who are here
called Assyrians by the prophet because the Assyrians were at that
time the chief enemies and persecutors of the people of GodIbid
Seven shepherds etc  Viz the pastors of Gods church and the
defenders of the faith The number seven in scripture is taken to
signify many and when eight is joined with it we are to understand
that the number will be very great

56 And they shall feed the land of Assyria with the sword and the
land of Nemrod with the spears thereof and he shall deliver us from
the Assyrian when he shall come into our land and when he shall tread
in our borders

They shall feed etc  They shall make spiritual conquests in the
lands of their persecutors with the word of the spirit which is the
word of God Eph 617

57 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as
a dew from the Lord and as drops upon the grass which waiteth not for
man nor tarrieth for the children of men

The remnant of Jacob  Viz the apostles and the first preachers of
the Jewish nation whose doctrine like dew shall make the plants of
the converted Gentiles grow up without waiting for any man to
cultivate them by human learning

58 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst
of many peoples as a lion among the beasts of the forests and as a
young lion among the flocks of sheep who when he shall go through
and tread down and take there is none to deliver

As a lion etc  This denotes the fortitude of these first preachers
and their success in their spiritual enterprises

59 Thy hand shall be lifted up over thy enemies and all thy enemies
shall be cut off

510 And it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord that I
will take away thy horses out of the midst of thee and will destroy
thy chariots

I will take away thy horses etc  Some understand this and all that
follows to the end of the chapter as addressed to the enemies of the
church But it may as well be understood of the converts to the church
who should no longer put their trust in any of these things

511 And I will destroy the cities of thy land and will throw down
all thy strong holds and I will take away sorceries out of thy hand
and there shall be no divinations in thee

512 And I will destroy thy graven things and thy statues out of the
midst of thee and thou shalt no more adore the works of thy hands

513 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee and will
crush thy cities

514 And I will execute vengeance in wrath and in indignation among
all the nations that have not given ear



Micheas Chapter 6


God expostulates with the Jews for their ingratitude and sins for
which they shall be punished

61 Hear ye what the Lord saith Arise contend thou in judgment
against the mountains and let the hills hear thy voice

The mountains etc  That is the great ones the princes of the
people

62 Let the mountains hear the judgment of the Lord and the strong
foundations of the earth for the Lord will enter into judgment with
his people and he will plead against Israel

63 O my people what have I done to thee or in what have I molested
thee answer thou me

64 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and delivered thee
out of the house of slaves and I sent before thy face Moses and
Aaron and Mary

65 O my people remember I pray thee what Balach the king of Moab
purposed and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Setim to
Galgal that thou mightest know the justice of the Lord

From Setim to Galgal  He puts them in mind of the favour he did them
in not suffering them to be quite destroyed by the evil purpose of
Balach and the wicked counsel of Balaam and then gives them a hint of
the wonders he wrought in order to bring them into the land of
Promise by stopping the course of the Jordan in their march from
Setim to Galgal

66 What shall I offer to the Lord that is worthy wherewith shall I
kneel before the high God shall I offer holocausts unto him and
calves of a year old

What shall I offer etc  This is spoken in the person of the people
desiring to be informed what they are to do to please God

67 May the Lord be appeased with thousands of rams or with many
thousands of fat he goats shall I give my firstborn for my wickedness
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul

68 I will shew thee O man what is good and what the Lord requireth
of thee Verily to do judgment and to love mercy and to walk
solicitous with thy God

69 The voice of the Lord crieth to the city and salvation shall be
to them that fear thy name hear O ye tribes and who shall approve it

610 As yet there is a fire in the house of the wicked the treasures
of iniquity and a scant measure full of wrath

Full of wrath etc  That is highly provoking in the sight of God

611 Shall I justify wicked balances and the deceitful weights of the
bag

612 By which her rich men were filled with iniquity and the
inhabitants thereof have spoken lies and their tongue was deceitful in
their mouth

613 And I therefore began to strike thee with desolation for thy
sins

614 Thou shalt eat but shalt not be filled and thy humiliation
shall be in the midst of thee and thou shalt take hold but shalt not
save and those whom thou shalt save I will give up to the sword

615 Thou shalt sow but shalt not reap thou shalt tread the olives
but shalt not be anointed with oil and the new wine but shalt not
drink the wine

616 For thou hast kept the statutes of Amri and all the works of the
house of Achab and thou hast walked according their wills that I
should make thee a desolation and the inhabitants thereof a hissing
and you shall bear the reproach of my people

The statutes of Amri etc  The wicked ways of Amri and Achab
idolatrous kings



Micheas Chapter 7


The prophet laments that notwithstanding all his preaching the
generality are still corrupt in their manners therefore their
desolation is at hand but they shall be restored again and prosper
and all mankind shall be redeemed by Christ

71 Woe is me for I am become as one that gleaneth in autumn the
grapes of the vintage there is no cluster to eat my soul desired the
first ripe figs

72 The holy man is perished out of the earth and there is none
upright among men they all lie in wait for blood every one hunteth
his brother to death

73 The evil of their hands they call good the prince requireth and
the judge is for giving and the great man hath uttered the desire of
his soul and they have troubled it

74 He that is best among them is as a brier and he that is
righteous as the thorn of the hedge The day of thy inspection thy
visitation cometh now shall be their destruction

75 Believe not a friend and trust not in a prince keep the doors of
thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom

76 For the son dishonoureth the father and the daughter riseth up
against her mother the daughter in law against her mother in law and
a mans enemies are they of his own household

77 But I will look towards the Lord I will wait for God my saviour
my God will hear me

78 Rejoice not thou my enemy over me because I am fallen I shall
arise when I sit in darkness the Lord is my light

79 I will bear the wrath of the Lord because I have sinned against
him until he judge my cause and execute judgement for me he will
bring me forth into the light I shall behold his justice

710 And my enemy shall behold and she shall be covered with shame
who saith to me Where is the Lord thy God my eyes shall look down
upon her now shall she be trodden under foot as the mire of the
streets

She shall be covered etc  Viz Babylon my enemy

711 The day shall come that thy walls may be built up in that day
shall the law be far removed

The law  Viz of thy enemies who have tyrannized over thee

712 In that day they shall come even from Assyria to thee and to the
fortified cities and from the fortified cities even to the river and
from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain

713 And the land shall be made desolate because of the inhabitants
thereof and for the fruit of their devices

The land etc  Viz of Babylon

714 Feed thy people with thy rod the flock of thy inheritance them
that dwell alone in the forest in the midst of Carmel they shall feed
in Basan and Galaad according to the days of old

715 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt I
will shew him wonders

716 The nations shall see and shall be confounded at all their
strength they shall put the hand upon the mouth their ears shall be
deaf

717 They shall lick the dust like serpents as the creeping things of
the earth they shall be disturbed in their houses they shall dread
the Lord our God and shall fear thee

718 Who is a God like to thee who takest away iniquity and passest
by the sin of the remnant of thy inheritance he will send his fury in
no more because he delighteth in mercy

719 He will turn again and have mercy on us he will put away our
iniquities and he will cast all our sins into the bottom of the sea

720 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob the mercy to Abraham which
thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old




THE PROPHECY OF NAHUM



NAHUM whose name signifies A COMFORTER was a native of Elcese or
Elcesai supposed to be a little town in Galilee He prophesied after
the ten tribes were carried into captivity and foretold the utter
destruction of Ninive by the Babylonians and Medes which happened in
the reign of JOSIAS



Nahum Chapter 1


The majesty of God his goodness to his people and severity to his
enemies

11 The burden of Ninive The book of the vision of Nahum the
Elcesite

12 The Lord is a jealous God and a revenger the Lord is a revenger
and hath wrath the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries and he is
angry with his enemies

13 The Lord is patient and great in power and will not cleanse and
acquit the guilty The Lords ways are in a tempest and a whirlwind
and clouds are the dust of his feet

14 He rebuketh the sea and drieth it up and bringeth all the rivers
to be a desert Basan languisheth and Carmel and the flower of Libanus
fadeth away

15 The mountains tremble at him and the hills are made desolate and
the earth hath quaked at his presence and the world and all that
dwell therein

16 Who can stand before the face of his indignation and who shall
resist in the fierceness of his anger his indignation is poured out
like fire and the rocks are melted by him

17 The Lord is good and giveth strength in the day of trouble and
knoweth them that hope in him

18 But with a flood that passeth by he will make an utter end of the
place thereof and darkness shall pursue his enemies

Of the place thereof  Viz of Ninive

19 What do ye devise against the Lord he will make an utter end
there shall not rise a double affliction

110 For as thorns embrace one another so while they are feasting and
drinking together they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry

111 Out of thee shall come forth one that imagineth evil against the
Lord contriving treachery in his mind

Shall come forth one etc  Some understand this of Sennacherib But
as his attempt against the people seems to have been prior to the
prophecy of Nahum we may better understand it of Holofernes

112 Thus saith the Lord Though they were perfect and many of them
so yet thus shall they be cut off and he shall pass I have afflicted
thee and I will afflict thee no more

Though they were perfect etc  That is however strong or numerous
their forces may be they shall be cut off and their prince or leader
shall pass away and disappear

113 And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy
back and I will burst thy bonds asunder

114 And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee that no
more of thy name shall be sown I will destroy the graven and molten
thing out of the house of thy God I will make it thy grave for thou
art disgraced

Will give a commandment  That is a decree concerning thee O king
of Ninive thy seed shall fail etc

115 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings and that preacheth peace O Juda keep thy festivals and pay
thy vows for Belial shall no more pass through thee again he is
utterly cut off

Belial  The wicked one viz the Assyrian



Nahum Chapter 2


God sends his armies against Ninive to destroy it

21 He is come up that shall destroy before thy face that shall keep
the siege watch the way fortify thy loins strengthen thy power
exceedingly

22 For the Lord hath rendered the pride of Jacob as the pride of
Israel because the spoilers have laid them waste and have marred
their vine branches

Hath rendered the pride of Jacob etc  He hath punished Jacob for his
pride and therefore Ninive must not expect to escape Or else
rendering the pride of Jacob means rewarding that is punishing Ninive
for the pride they exercised against Jacob

23 The shield of his mighty men is like fire the men of the army are
clad in scarlet the reins of the chariot are flaming in the day of his
preparation and the drivers are stupefied

Of his mighty men etc  He speaks of the Chaldeans and Medes sent to
destroy NiniveIbid Stupefied  consopiti That is they drive on
furiously like men intoxicated with wine

24 They are in confusion in the ways the chariots jostle one against
another in the streets their looks are like torches like lightning
running to and fro

25 He will muster up his valiant men they shall stumble in their
march they shall quickly get upon the walls thereof and a covering
shall be prepared

Stumble in their march  By running hastily on

26 The gates of the rivers are opened and the temple is thrown down
to the ground

27 And the soldier is led away captive and her bondwomen were led
away mourning as doves murmuring in their hearts

28 And as for Ninive her waters are like a great pool but the men
flee away They cry Stand stand but there is none that will return
back

29 Take ye the spoil of the silver take the spoil of the gold for
there is no end of the riches of all the precious furniture

210 She is destroyed and rent and torn the heart melteth and the
knees fail and all the loins lose their strength and the faces of
them all are as the blackness of a kettle

211 Where is now the dwelling of the lions and the feeding place of
the young lions to which the lion went to enter in thither the young
lion and there was none to make them afraid

212 The lion caught enough for his whelps and killed for his
lionesses and he filled his holes with prey and his den with rapine

213 Behold I come against thee saith the Lord of hosts and I will
burn thy chariots even to smoke and the sword shall devour thy young
lions and I will cut off thy prey out of the land and the voice of
thy messengers shall be heard no more



Nahum Chapter 3


The miserable destruction of Ninive

31 Woe to thee O city of blood all full of lies and violence
rapine shall not depart from thee

32 The noise of the whip and the noise of the rattling of the
wheels and of the neighing horse and of the running chariot and of
the horsemen coming up

33 And of the shining sword and of the glittering spear and of a
multitude slain and of a grievous destruction and there is no end of
carcasses and they shall fall down on their dead bodies

34 Because of the multitude of the fornications of the harlot that
was beautiful and agreeable and that made use of witchcraft that sold
nations through her fornications and families through her witchcrafts

35 Behold I come against thee saith the Lord of hosts and I will
discover thy shame to thy face and will shew thy nakedness to the
nations and thy shame to kingdoms

36 And I will cast abominations upon thee and will disgrace thee
and will make an example of thee

37 And it shall come to pass that every one that shall see thee
shall flee from thee and shall say Ninive is laid waste who shall
bemoan thee whence shall I seek a comforter for thee

38 Art thou better than the populous Alexandria that dwelleth among
the rivers waters are round about it the sea is its riches the
waters are its walls

Populous Alexandria  NoAmmon A populous city of Egypt destroyed by
the Chaldeans and afterwards rebuilt by Alexander and called
Alexandria Others suppose NoAmmon to be the same as Diospolis

39 Ethiopia and Egypt were the strength thereof and there is no end
Africa and the Libyans were thy helpers

310 Yet she also was removed and carried into captivity her young
children were dashed in pieces at the top of every street and they
cast lots upon her nobles and all her great men were bound in fetters

311 Therefore thou also shalt be made drunk and shalt be despised
and thou shalt seek help from the enemies

312 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with their green
figs if they be shaken they shall fall into the mouth of the eater

313 Behold thy people in the midst of thee are women the gates of
thy land shall be set wide open to thy enemies the fire shall devour
thy bars

314 Draw thee water for the siege build up thy bulwarks go into the
clay and tread work it and make brick

315 There shall the fire devour thee thou shalt perish by the sword
it shall devour thee like the bruchus assemble together like the
bruchus make thyself many like the locust

316 Thou hast multiplied thy merchandises above the stars of heaven
the bruchus hath spread himself and flown away

317 Thy guards are like the locusts and thy little ones like the
locusts of locusts which swarm on the hedges in the day of cold the
sun arose and they flew away and their place was not known where they
were

Locusts of locusts  The young locusts

318 Thy shepherds have slumbered O king of Assyria thy princes
shall be buried thy people are hid in the mountains and there is none
to gather them

319 Thy destruction is not hidden thy wound is grievous all that
have heard the fame of thee have clapped their hands over thee for
upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually




THE PROPHECY OF HABACUC



HABACUC was a native of Bezocher and prophesied in JUDA some time
before the invasion of the CHALDEANS which he foretold He lived to
see this prophecy fulfilled and for many years after according to the
general opinion which supposes him to be the same that was brought by
the ANGEL to DANIEL in BABYLON Dan 14



Habacuc Chapter 1


The prophet complains of the wickedness of the people God reveals to
him the vengeance he is going to take of them by the Chaldeans

11 The burden that Habacuc the prophet saw

Burden  Such prophecies more especially are called burdens as
threaten grievous evils and punishments

12 How long O Lord shall I cry and thou wilt not hear shall I cry
out to thee suffering violence and thou wilt not save

13 Why hast thou shewn me iniquity and grievance to see rapine and
injustice before me and there is a judgment but opposition is more
powerful

14 Therefore the law is torn in pieces and judgment cometh not to
the end because the wicked prevaileth against the just therefore
wrong judgment goeth forth

15 Behold ye among the nations and see wonder and be astonished
for a work is done in your days which no man will believe when it
shall be told

16 For behold I will raise up the Chaldeans a bitter and swift
nation marching upon the breadth of the earth to possess the dwelling
places that are not their own

17 They are dreadful and terrible from themselves shall their
judgment and their burden proceed

18 Their horses are lighter than leopards and swifter than evening
wolves and their horsemen shall be spread abroad for their horsemen
shall come from afar they shall fly as an eagle that maketh haste to
eat

19 They shall all come to the prey their face is like a burning
wind and they shall gather together captives as the sand

110 And their prince shall triumph over kings and princes shall be
his laughingstock and he shall laugh at every strong hold and shall
cast up a mount and shall take it

111 Then shall his spirit be changed and he shall pass and fall
this is his strength of his god

Then shall his spirit etc  Viz the spirit of the king of Babylon
It alludes to the judgment of God upon Nabuchodonosor recorded Dan
4 and to the speedy fall of the Chaldean empire

112 Wast thou not from the beginning O Lord my God my holy one and
we shall not die Lord thou hast appointed him for judgment and made
him strong for correction

113 Thy eyes are too pure to behold evil and thou canst not look on
iniquity Why lookest thou upon them that do unjust things and holdest
thy peace when the wicked devoureth the man that is more just than
himself

114 And thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea and as the
creeping things that have no ruler

115 He lifted up all them with his hook he drew them in his drag
and gathered them into his net for this he will be glad and rejoice

116 Therefore will he offer victims to his drag and he will
sacrifice to his net because through them his portion is made fat and
his meat dainty

117 For this cause therefore he spreadeth his net and will not spare
continually to slay the nations



Habacuc Chapter 2


The prophet is admonished to wait with faith The enemies of Gods
people shall assuredly be punished

21 I will stand upon my watch and fix my foot upon the tower and I
will watch to see what will be said to me and what I may answer to
him that reproveth me

Will stand etc  Waiting to see what the Lord will answer to my
complaint viz that the Chaldeans who are worse than the Jews and
who attribute all their success to their own strength or to their
idols should nevertheless prevail over the people of the Lord The
Lords answer is that the prophet must wait with patience and faith
that all should be set right in due time and the enemies of God and
his people punished according to their deserts

22 And the Lord answered me and said Write the vision and make it
plain upon tables that he that readeth it may run over it

23 For as yet the vision is far off and it shall appear at the end
and shall not lie if it make any delay wait for it for it shall
surely come and it shall not be slack

24 Behold he that is unbelieving his soul shall not be right in
himself but the just shall live in his faith

25 And as wine deceiveth him that drinketh it so shall the proud man
be and he shall not be honoured who hath enlarged his desire like
hell and is himself like death and he is never satisfied but will
gather together unto him all nations and heap together unto him all
people

As wine deceiveth etc  Viz by affording only a short passing
pleasure followed by the evils and disgrace that are the usual
consequences of drunkenness so shall it be with the proud enemies of
the people of God whose success affordeth them only a momentary
pleasure followed by innumerable and everlasting evils

26 Shall not all these take up a parable against him and a dark
speech concerning him and it shall be said Woe to him that heapeth
together that which is not his own how long also doth he load himself
with thick clay

Thick clay  Illgotten goods that like mire both burden and defile
the soul

27 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and they be
stirred up that shall tear thee and thou shalt be a spoil to them

28 Because thou hast spoiled many nations all that shall be left of
the people shall spoil thee because of mens blood and for the
iniquity of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein

29 Woe to him that gathereth together an evil covetousness to his
house that his nest may be on high and thinketh he may be delivered
out of the hand of evil

210 Thou hast devised confusion to thy house thou hast cut off many
people and thy soul hath sinned

211 For the stone shall cry out of the wall and the timber that is
between the joints of the building shall answer

212 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood and prepareth a city
by iniquity

213 Are not these things from the Lord of hosts for the people shall
labour in a great fire and the nations in vain and they shall faint

Are not these things etc  That is shall not these punishments that
are here recorded come from the Lord upon him that is guilty of such
crimesIbid The people shall labour etc  Viz the enemies of
Gods people

214 For the earth shall be filled that men may know the glory of the
Lord as waters covering the sea

215 Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend and presenteth his
gall and maketh him drunk that he may behold his nakedness

216 Thou art filled with shame instead of glory drink thou also and
fall fast asleep the cup of the right hand of the Lord shall compass
thee and shameful vomiting shall be on thy glory

217 For the iniquity of Libanus shall cover thee and the ravaging of
beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of men and the iniquity
of the land and of the city and of all that dwell therein

The iniquity of Libanus  That is the iniquity committed by the
Chaldeans against the temple of God signified here by the name of
Libanus

218 What doth the graven thing avail because the maker thereof hath
graven it a molten and a false image because the forger thereof hath
trusted in a thing of his own forging to make dumb idols

219 Woe to him that saith to wood Awake to the dumb stone Arise
can it teach Behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there
is no spirit in the bowels thereof

220 But the Lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep
silence before him



Habacuc Chapter 3


31 A PRAYER OF HABACUC THE PROPHET FOR IGNORANCES

For ignorances  That is for the sins of his people In the Hebrew
it is Sigionoth which some take to signify a musical instrument or
tune with which this sublime prayer and canticle was to be sung

32 O Lord I have heard thy hearing and was afraid O Lord thy
work in the midst of the years bring it to life In the midst of the
years thou shalt make it known when thou art angry thou wilt remember
mercy

Thy hearing etc  That is thy oracles the great and wonderful
things thou hast revealed to me and I was struck with a reverential
fear and aweIbid Thy work  The great work of the redemption of
man which thou wilt bring to life and light in the midst of the years
when our calamities and miseries shall be at their height

33 God will come from the south and the holy one from mount Pharan
His glory covered the heavens and the earth is full of his praise

God will come from the south etc  God himself will come to give us
his law and to conduct us into the true land of promise as heretofore
he came from the South in the Hebrew Theman and from mount Pharan to
give his law to his people in the desert See Deut 332

34 His brightness shall be as the light horns are in his hands
There is his strength hid

Horns etc  That is strength and power which by a Hebrew phrase
are called horns Or beams of light which come forth from his hands
Or it may allude to the cross in the horns of which the hands of
Christ were fastened where his strength was hidden by which he
overcame the world and drove out death and the devil

35 Death shall go before his face And the devil shall go forth
before his feet

Death shall go before his face etc  Both death and the devil shall
be the executioners of his justice against his enemies as they were
heretofore against the Egyptians and Chanaanites

36 He stood and measured the earth He beheld and melted the
nations and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces The hills of
the world were bowed down by the journeys of his eternity

He beheld etc  One look of his eye is enough to melt all the
nations and to reduce them to nothing For all heaven and earth
disappear when they come before his light Apoc 2011 Ibid The
ancient mountains etc  By the mountains and hills are signified the
great ones of the world that persecute the church whose power was
quickly crushed by the Almighty

37 I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity the curtains of
the land of Madian shall be troubled

Ethiopia  the land of the Blacks and Madian are here taken for the
enemies of God and his people who shall perish for their iniquity

38 Wast thou angry O Lord with the rivers or was thy wrath upon
the rivers or thy indignation in the sea Who will ride upon thy
horses and thy chariots are salvation

With the rivers etc  He alludes to the wonders wrought heretofore by
the Lord in favour of his people Israel when the waters of the rivers
viz of Arnon and Jordan and of the Red Sea retired before their
face when he came as it were with his horses and chariots to save them
when he took up his bow for their defence in consequence of the oath
he had made to their tribes when the mountains trembled and the deep
stood with its waves raised up in a heap as with hands lifted up to
heaven when the sun and the moon stood still at his command etc to
comply with his anger not against the rivers and sea but against the
enemies of his people How much more will he do in favour of his Son
and against the enemies of his church

39 Thou wilt surely take up thy bow according to the oaths which
thou hast spoken to the tribes Thou wilt divide the rivers of the
earth

310 The mountains saw thee and were grieved the great body of
waters passed away The deep put forth its voice the deep lifted up
its hands

311 The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation in the
light of thy arrows they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering
spear

312 In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot in thy wrath
thou wilt astonish the nations

313 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people for salvation
with thy Christ Thou struckest the head of the house of the wicked
thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck

The head of the house of the wicked  Such was Pharao heretofore such
shall Antichrist be hereafter

314 Thou hast cursed his sceptres the head of his warriors them
that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me Their joy was like that of
him that devoureth the poor man in secret

315 Thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses in the mud of many
waters

Thou madest a way in the sea etc  To deliver thy people from the
Egyptian bondage and thou shalt work the like wonders in the spiritual
way to rescue the children of the church from their enemies

316 I have heard and my bowels were troubled my lips trembled at the
voice Let rottenness enter into my bones and swarm under me That I
may rest in the day of tribulation that I may go up to our people that
are girded

I have heard etc  Viz the evils that are now coming upon the
Israelites for their sins and that shall come hereafter upon all
impenitent sinners and the foresight that I have of these miseries
makes me willing to die that I may be at rest before this general
tribulation comes in which all good things shall be withdrawn from the
wickedIbid That I may go up to our people etc  That I may join
the happy company in the bosom of Abraham that are girded that is
prepared for their journey by which they shall attend their Lord when
he shall ascend into heaven To which high and happy place my Jesus
that is my Saviour the great conqueror of death and hell shall one
day conduct me rejoicing and singing psalms of praise ver 18 and 19

317 For the fig tree shall not blossom and there shall be no spring
in the vines The labour of the olive tree shall fail and the fields
shall yield no food the flock shall be cut off from the fold and
there shall be no herd in the stalls

318 But I will rejoice in the Lord and I will joy in God my Jesus

319 The Lord God is my strength and he will make my feet like the
feet of harts and he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places
singing psalms




THE PROPHECY OF SOPHONIAS



SOPHONIAS whose name saith St Jerome signifies The Watchman of the
Lord or The hidden of the Lord prophesied in the beginning of the
reign of Josias He was a native of Sarabatha and of the tribe of
Simeon according to the more general opinion He prophesied the
punishments of the Jews for their idolatry and other crimes also the
punishments that were to come on divers nations the coming of Christ
the conversion of the Gentiles the blindness of the Jews and their
conversion towards the end of the world



Sophonias Chapter 1


For divers enormous sins the kingdom of Juda is threatened with severe
judgment

11 The word of the Lord that came to Sophonias the son of Chusi the
son of Godolias the son of Amarias the son of Ezechias in the days
of Josias the son of Amon king of Juda

12 Gathering I will gather together all things from off the face of
the land saith the Lord

Gathering I will gather etc  That is I will assuredly take away
and wholly consume either by captivity or death both men and beasts
out of this land

13 I will gather man and beast I will gather the birds of the air
and the fishes of the sea and the ungodly shall meet with ruin and I
will destroy men from off the face of the land saith the Lord

14 And I will stretch out my hand upon Juda and upon all the
inhabitants of Jerusalem and I will destroy out of this place the
remnant of Baal and the names of the wardens of the temples with the
priests

The wardens etc  Viz of the temples of the idols AEdituos in
Hebrew the Chemarims that is such as kindle the fires or burn
incense

15 And them that worship the host of heaven upon the tops of houses
and them that adore and swear by the Lord and swear by Melchom

Melchom  The idol of the Ammonites

16 And them that turn away from following after the Lord and that
have not sought the Lord nor searched after him

17 Be silent before the face of the Lord God for the day of the Lord
is near for the Lord hath prepared a victim he hath sanctified his
guests

18 And it shall come to pass in the day of the victim of the Lord
that I will visit upon the princes and upon the kings sons and upon
all such as are clothed with strange apparel

19 And I will visit in that day upon every one that entereth
arrogantly over the threshold them that fill the house of the Lord
their God with iniquity and deceit

110 And there shall be in that day saith the Lord the noise of a
cry from the fish gate and a howling from the Second and a great
destruction from the hills

The Second  A part of the city so called

111 Howl ye inhabitants of the Morter All the people of Chanaan is
hush all are cut off that were wrapped up in silver

The Morter  Maktesh A valley in or near Jerusalem Ibid The
people of Chanaan  So he calls the Jews from their following the
wicked ways of the Chanaanites

112 And it shall come to pass at that time that I will search
Jerusalem with lamps and will visit upon the men that are settled on
their lees that say in their hearts The Lord will not do good nor
will he do evil

Settled on their lees  That is the wealthy and such as live at
their ease resting upon their riches like wine upon the lees

113 And their strength shall become a booty and their houses as a
desert and they shall build houses and shall not dwell in them and
they shall plant vineyards and shall not drink the wine of them

114 The great day of the Lord is near it is near and exceeding
swift the voice of the day of the Lord is bitter the mighty man shall
there meet with tribulation

115 That day is a day of wrath a day of tribulation and distress a
day of calamity and misery a day of darkness and obscurity a day of
clouds and whirlwinds

116 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities and
against the high bulwarks

117 And I will distress men and they shall walk like blind men
because they have sinned against the Lord and their blood shall be
poured out as earth and their bodies as dung

118 Neither shall their silver and their gold be able to deliver them
in the day of the wrath of the Lord all the land shall be devoured by
the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy destruction
of all them that dwell in the land



Sophonias Chapter 2


An exhortation to repentance The judgment of the Philistines of the
Moabites and the Ammonites of the Ethiopians and the Assyrians

21Assemble yourselves together be gathered together O nation not
worthy to be loved

22 Before the decree bring forth the day as dust passing away before
the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you before the day of the
Lords indignation come upon you

23 Seek the Lord all ye meek of the earth you that have wrought his
judgment seek the just seek the meek if by any means you may be hid
in the day of the Lords indignation

24 For Gaza shall be destroyed and Ascalon shall be a desert they
shall cast out Azotus at noonday and Accaron shall be rooted up

25 Woe to you that inhabit the sea coast O nation of reprobates the
word of the Lord upon you O Chanaan the land of the Philistines and
I will destroy thee so that there shall not be an inhabitant

26 And the sea coast shall be the resting place of shepherds and
folds for cattle

27 And it shall be the portion of him that shall remain of the house
of Juda there they shall feed in the houses of Ascalon they shall
rest in the evening because the Lord their God will visit them and
bring back their captivity

28 I have heard the reproach of Moab and the blasphemies of the
children of Ammon with which they reproached my people and have
magnified themselves upon their borders

29 Therefore as I live saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel
Moab shall be as Sodom and the children of Ammon as Gomorrha the
dryness of thorns and heaps of salt and a desert even for ever the
remnant of my people shall make a spoil of them and the residue of my
nation shall possess them

210 This shall befall them for their pride because they have
blasphemed and have been magnified against the people of the Lord of
hosts

211 The Lord shall be terrible upon them and shall consume all the
gods of the earth and they shall adore him every man from his own
place all the islands of the Gentiles

212 You Ethiopians also shall be slain with my sword

213 And he will stretch out his hand upon the north and will destroy
Assyria and he will make the beautiful city a wilderness and as a
place not passable and as a desert

The beautiful city viz  Ninive which was destroyed soon after this
viz in the sixteenth year of the reign of Josias

214 And flocks shall lie down in the midst thereof all the beasts of
the nations and the bittern and the urchin shall lodge in the
threshold thereof the voice of the singing bird in the window the
raven on the upper post for I will consume her strength

215 This is the glorious city that dwelt in security that said in
her heart I am and there is none beside me how is she become a
desert a place for beasts to lie down in every one that passeth by
her shall hiss and wag his hand



Sophonias Chapter 3


A woe to Jerusalem for her sins A prophecy of the conversion of the
Gentiles and of the poor of Israel God shall be with them The Jews
shall be converted at last

31 Woe to the provoking and redeemed city the dove

32 She hath not hearkened to the voice neither hath she received
discipline she hath not trusted in the Lord she drew not near to her
God

33 Her princes are in the midst of her as roaring lions her judges
are evening wolves they left nothing for the morning

34 Her prophets are senseless men without faith her priests have
polluted the sanctuary they have acted unjustly against the law

35 The just Lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity in
the morning in the morning he will bring his judgment to light and it
shall not be hid but the wicked man hath not known shame

36 I have destroyed the nations and their towers are beaten down I
have made their ways desert so that there is none that passeth by
their cities are desolate there is not a man remaining nor any
inhabitant

37 I said Surely thou wilt fear me thou wilt receive correction
and her dwelling shall not perish for all things wherein I have
visited her but they rose early and corrupted all their thoughts

38 Wherefore expect me saith the Lord in the day of my resurrection
that is to come for my judgment is to assemble the Gentiles and to
gather the kingdoms and to pour upon them my indignation all my
fierce anger for with the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be
devoured

39 Because then I will restore to the people a chosen lip that all
may call upon the name of the Lord and may serve him with one
shoulder

310 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia shall my suppliants the
children of my dispersed people bring me an offering

311 In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein
thou hast transgressed against me for then I will take away out of the
midst of thee thy proud boasters and thou shalt no more be lifted up
because of my holy mountain

312 And I will leave in the midst of thee a poor and needy people
and they shall hope in the name of the Lord

313 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies nor
shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed
and shall lie down and there shall be none to make them afraid

314 Give praise O daughter of Sion shout O Israel be glad and
rejoice with all thy heart O daughter of Jerusalem

315 The Lord hath taken away thy judgment he hath turned away thy
enemies the king of Israel the Lord is in the midst of thee thou
shalt fear evil no more

316 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem Fear not to Sion
Let not thy hands be weakened

317 The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he
will rejoice over thee with gladness he will be silent in his love he
will be joyful over thee in praise

318 The triflers that were departed from the law I will gather
together because they were of thee that thou mayest no more suffer
reproach for them

319 Behold I will cut off all that have afflicted thee at that time
and I will save her that halteth and will gather her that was cast
out and I will get them praise and a name in all the land where they
had been put to confusion

320 At that time when I will bring you and at the time that I will
gather you for I will give you a name and praise among all the people
of the earth when I shall have brought back your captivity before your
eyes saith the Lord




THE PROPHECY OF AGGEUS



AGGEUS was one of those that returned from the captivity of Babylon in
the first year of the reign of king Cyrus He was sent by the Lord in
the second year of the reign of king Darius the son of Hystaspes to
exhort Zorobabel the prince of Juda and Jesus the high priest to the
building of the temple which they had begun but left off again
through the opposition of the Samaritans In consequence of this
exhortation they proceeded in the building and finished the temple And
the prophet was commissioned by the Lord to assure them that this
second temple should be more glorious than the former because the
Messiah should honour it with his presence signifying withal how much
the church of the New Testament should excel that of the Old Testament



Aggeus Chapter 1


The people are reproved for neglecting to build the temple They are
encouraged to set about the work

11 In the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month in the
first day of the month the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus
the prophet to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel governor of Juda and
to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest saying

12 Thus saith the Lord of hosts saying This people saith The time
is not yet come for building the house of the Lord

13 And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet
saying

14 Is it time for you to dwell in ceiled houses and this house lie
desolate

15 And now thus saith the Lord of hosts Set your hearts to consider
your ways

16 You have sowed much and brought in little you have eaten but
have not had enough you have drunk but have not been filled with
drink you have clothed yourselves but have not been warmed and he
that hath earned wages put them into a bag with holes

17 Thus saith the Lord of hosts Set your hearts upon your ways

18 Go up to the mountain bring timber and build the house and it
shall be acceptable to me and I shall be glorified saith the Lord

19 You have looked for more and behold it became less and you
brought it home and I blowed it away why saith the Lord of hosts
because my house is desolate and you make haste every man to his own
house

110 Therefore the heavens over you were stayed from giving dew and
the earth was hindered from yielding her fruits

111 And I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains
and upon the corn and upon the wine and upon the oil and upon all
that the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon beasts and upon
all the labour of the hands

112 Then Zorobabel the son of Salathiel and Jesus the son of Josedec
the high priest and all the remnant of the people hearkened to the
voice of the Lord their God and to the words of Aggeus the prophet as
the Lord their God sent him to them and the people feared before the
Lord

113 And Aggeus the messenger of the Lord as one of the messengers of
the Lord spoke saying to the people I am with you saith the Lord

114 And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of
Salathiel governor of Juda and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedec
the high priest and the spirit of all the rest of the people and they
went in and did the work in the house of the Lord of Hosts their God



Aggeus Chapter 2


Christ by his coming shall make the latter temple more glorious than
the former The blessing of God shall reward their labour in building
Gods promise to Zorobabel

21 In the four and twentieth day of the month in the sixth month in
the second year of Darius the king they began

22 And in the seventh month the word of the Lord came by the hand of
Aggeus the prophet saying

23 Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel the governor of Juda and
to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest and to the rest of the
people saying

24 Who is left among you that saw this house in its first glory and
how do you see it now is it not in comparison to that as nothing in
your eyes

25 Yet now take courage O Zorobabel saith the Lord and take
courage Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest and take courage
all ye people of the land saith the Lord of hosts and perform for I
am with you saith the Lord of hosts

26 The word that I convenanted with you when you came out of the land
of Egypt and my spirit shall be in the midst of you fear not

27 For thus saith the Lord of hosts Yet one little while and I will
move the heaven and the earth and the sea and the dry land

28 And I will move all nations AND THE DESIRED OF ALL NATIONS SHALL
COME and I will fill this house with glory saith the Lord of hosts

29 The silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts

210 Great shall be the glory of this last house more than of the
first saith the Lord of hosts and in this place I will give peace
saith the Lord of hosts

211 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month in the second
year of Darius the king the word of the Lord came to Aggeus the
prophet saying

212 Thus saith the Lord of hosts Ask the priests the law saying

213 If a man carry sanctified flesh in the skirt of his garment and
touch with his skirt bread or pottage or wine or oil or any meat
shall it be sanctified And the priests answered and said No

214 And Aggeus said If one that is unclean by occasion of a soul
touch any of all these things shall it be defiled And the priests
answered and said It shall be defiled

By occasion of a soul  That is by having touched the dead in which
case according to the prescription of the law Num 1913 22 a
person not only became unclean himself but made every thing that he
touched unclean The prophet applies all this to the people whose
souls remained unclean by neglecting the temple of God and therefore
were not sanctified by the flesh they offered in sacrifice but rather
defiled their sacrifices by approaching to them in the state of
uncleanness

215 And Aggeus answered and said So is this people and so is this
nation before my face saith the Lord and so is all the work of their
hands and all that they have offered there shall be defiled

216 And now consider in your hearts from this day and upward before
there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord

217 When you went to a heap of twenty bushels and they became ten
and you went into the press to press out fifty vessels and they
became twenty

218 I struck you with a blasting wind and all the works of your hand
with the mildew and with hail yet there was none among you that
returned to me saith the Lord

219 Set your hearts from this day and henceforward from the four
and twentieth day of the ninth month from the day that the foundations
of the temple of the Lord were laid and lay it up in your hearts

220 Is the seed as yet sprung up or hath the vine and the fig tree
and the pomegranate and the olive tree as yet flourished from this
day I will bless you

221 And the word of the Lord came a second time to Aggeus in the four
and twentieth day of the month saying

222 Speak to Zorobabel the governor of Juda saying I will move both
heaven and earth

223 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and will destroy the
strength of the kingdom of the Gentiles and I will overthrow the
chariot and him that rideth therein and the horses and their riders
shall come down every one by the sword of his brother

224 In that day saith the Lord of hosts I will take thee O
Zorobabel the son of Salathiel my servant saith the Lord and will
make thee as a signet for I have chosen thee saith the Lord of hosts

O Zorobabel  This promise principally relates to Christ who was of
the race of Zorobabel




THE PROPHECY OF ZACHARIAS



ZACHARIAS began to prophesy in the same year as Aggeus and upon the
same occasion His prophecy is full of mysterious figures and promises
of blessings partly relating to the synagogue and partly to the
church of Christ



Zacharias Chapter 1


The prophet exhorts the people to return to God and declares his
visions by which he puts them in hopes of better times

11 In the eighth month in the second year of king Darius the word
of the Lord came to Zacharias the son of Barachias the son of Addo
the prophet saying

12 The Lord hath been exceeding angry with your fathers

13 And thou shalt say to them Thus saith the Lord of hosts Turn ye
to me saith the Lord of hosts and I will turn to you saith the Lord
of hosts

14 Be not as your fathers to whom the former prophets have cried
saying Thus saith the Lord of hosts Turn ye from your evil ways and
from your wicked thoughts but they did not give ear neither did they
hearken to me saith the Lord

15 Your fathers where are they and the prophets shall they live
always

16 But yet my words and my ordinances which I gave in charge to my
servants the prophets did they not take hold of your fathers and they
returned and said As the Lord of hosts thought to do to us according
to our ways and according to our devices so he hath done to us

17 In the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is
called Sabath in the second year of Darius the word of the Lord came
to Zacharias the son of Barachias the son of Addo the prophet
saying

18 I saw by night and behold a man riding upon a red horse and he
stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom and behind him
were horses red speckled and white

A man  An angel in the shape of a man It was probably Michael the
guardian angel of the church of God

19 And I said What are these my Lord and the angel that spoke in
me said to me I will shew thee what these are

110 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said
These are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk through the earth

These are they etc  The guardian angels of provinces and nations

111 And they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the
myrtle trees and said We have walked through the earth and behold
all the earth is inhabited and is at rest

112 And the angel of the Lord answered and said O Lord of hosts
how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of
Juda with which thou hast been angry this is now the seventieth year

The seventieth year  Viz from the beginning of the seige of
Jerusalem in the ninth year of king Sedecias to the second year of
king Darius These seventy years of the desolation of Jerusalem and the
cities of Juda are different from the seventy years of captivity
foretold by Jeremias which began in the fourth year of Joakim and
ended in the first year of king Cyrus

113 And the Lord answered the angel that spoke in me good words
comfortable words

114 And the angel that spoke in me said to me Cry thou saying
Thus saith the Lord of hosts I am zealous for Jerusalem and Sion with
a great zeal

115 And I am angry with a great anger with the wealthy nations for I
was angry a little but they helped forward the evil

116 Therefore thus saith the Lord I will return to Jerusalem in
mercies my house shall be built in it saith the Lord of hosts and
the building line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem

117 Cry yet saying Thus saith the Lord of hosts My cities shall
yet flow with good things and the Lord will yet comfort Sion and he
will yet choose Jerusalem

118 And I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold four horns

Four horns  The four horns represent the empires or kingdoms that
persecute and oppress the kingdom of God

119 And I said to the angel that spoke in me What are these And he
said to me These are the horns that have scattered Juda and Israel
and Jerusalem

120 And the Lord shewed me four smiths

Four smiths  The four smiths or carpenters  for faber may signify
either represent those whom God makes his instruments in bringing to
nothing the power of persecutors

121 And I said What come these to do and he spoke saying These
are the horns which have scattered Juda every man apart and none of
them lifted up his head and these are come to fray them to cast down
the horns of the nations that have lifted up the horn upon the land of
Juda to scatter it



Zacharias Chapter 2


Under the name of Jerusalem he prophesieth the progress of the church
of Christ by the conversion of some Jews and many Gentiles

21 And I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold a man with a
measuring line in his hand

22 And I said Whither goest thou and he said to me To measure
Jerusalem and to see how great is the breadth thereof and how great
the length thereof

23 And behold the angel that spoke in me went forth and another
angel went out to meet him

24 And he said to him Run speak to this young man saying
Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls by reason of the multitude
of men and of the beasts in the midst thereof

Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls  This must be understood
of the spiritual Jerusalem the church of Christ

25 And I will be to it saith the Lord a wall of fire round about
and I will be in glory in the midst thereof

26 O O flee ye out of the land of the north saith the Lord for I
have scattered you into the four winds of heaven saith the Lord

27 O Sion flee thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon

28 For thus saith the Lord of hosts After the glory he hath sent me
to the nations that have robbed you for he that toucheth you toucheth
the apple of my eye

29 For behold I lift up my hand upon them and they shall be a prey
to those that served them and you shall know that the Lord of hosts
sent me

210 Sing praise and rejoice O daughter of Sion for behold I come
and I will dwell in the midst of thee saith the Lord

211 And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day and
they shall be my people and I will dwell in the midst of thee and
thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to thee

212 And the Lord shall possess Juda his portion in the sanctified
land and he shall yet choose Jerusalem

213 Let all flesh be silent at the presence of the Lord for he is
risen up out of his holy habitation



Zacharias Chapter 3


In a vision Satan appeareth accusing the high priest He is cleansed
from his sins Christ is promised and great fruit from his passion

31 And the Lord shewed me Jesus the high priest standing before the
angel of the Lord and Satan stood on his right hand to be his
adversary

Jesus  Alias Josue the son of Josedec the high priest of that
time

32 And the Lord said to Satan The Lord rebuke thee O Satan and the
Lord that chose Jerusalem rebuke thee Is not this a brand plucked out
of the fire

33 And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments and he stood before
the face of the angel

With filthy garments  Negligences and sins

34 Who answered and said to them that stood before him saying Take
away the filthy garments from him And he said to him Behold I have
taken away thy iniquity and have clothed thee with change of garments

35 And he said Put a clean mitre upon his head and they put a clean
mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of
the Lord stood

36 And the angel of the Lord protested to Jesus saying

37 Thus saith the Lord of hosts If thou wilt walk in my ways and
keep my charge thou also shalt judge my house and shalt keep my
courts and I will give thee some of them that are now present here to
walk with thee

I will give thee etc  Angels to attend and assist thee

38 Hear O Jesus thou high priest thou and thy friends that dwell
before thee for they are portending men for behold I WILL BRING MY
SERVANT THE ORIENT

Portending men  That is men who by words and actions are to
foreshew wonders that are to comeIbid My servant the
Orient  Christ who according to his humanity is the servant of God
is called the Orient from his rising like the sun in the east to
enlighten the world

39 For behold the stone that I have laid before Jesus upon one stone
there are seven eyes behold I will grave the graving thereof saith
the Lord of hosts and I will take away the iniquity of that land in
one day

The stone  Another emblem of Christ the rock foundation and corner
stone of his churchIbid Seven eyes  The manifold providence of
Christ over his church or the seven gifts of the spirit of GodIbid
One day  Viz the day of the passion of Christ the source of all
our good when this precious stone shall be graved that is cut and
pierced with whips thorns nails and spear

310 In that day saith the Lord of hosts every man shall call his
friend under the vine and under the fig tree



Zacharias Chapter 4


The vision of the golden candlestick and seven lamps and of the two
olive trees

41 And the angel that spoke in me came again and he waked me as a
man that is wakened out of his sleep

42 And he said to me What seest thou And I said I have looked
and behold a candlestick all of gold and its lamp upon the top of it
and the seven lights thereof upon it and seven funnels for the lights
that were upon the top thereof

A candlestick etc  The temple of God that was then in building and
in a more sublime sense the church of Christ

43 And two olive trees over it one upon the right side of the lamp
and the other upon the left side thereof

44 And I answered and said to the angel that spoke in me saying
What are these things my lord

45 And the angel that spoke in me answered and said to me Knowest
thou not what these things are And I said No my lord

46 And he answered and spoke to me saying This is the word of the
Lord to Zorobabel saying Not with an army nor by might but by my
spirit saith the Lord of hosts

To Zorobabel  This vision was in favour of Zorobabel to assure him
of success in the building of the temple which he had begun signified
by the candlestick the lamp of which without any other industry was
supplied with oil dropping from the two olive trees and distributed
by the seven funnels or pipes to maintain the seven lights

47 Who art thou O great mountain before Zorobabel thou shalt
become a plain and he shall bring out the chief stone and shall give
equal grace to the grace thereof

Great mountain  So he calls the opposition made by the enemies of
Gods people which nevertheless without an army or might on their
side was quashed by divine providenceIbid Shall give equal grace
etc  Shall add grace to grace or beauty to beauty

48 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

49 The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundations of this house
and his hands shall finish it and you shall know that the Lord of
hosts hath sent me to you

410 For who hath despised little days and they shall rejoice and
shall see the tin plummet in the hand of Zorobabel These are the seven
eyes of the Lord that run to and fro through the whole earth

Little days  That is these small and feeble beginnings of the temple
of GodIbid The tin plummet  Literally the stone of tin He
means the builders plummet which Zorobabel shall hold in his hand for
the finishing the buildingIbid The seven eyes  The providence of
God that oversees and orders all things

411 And I answered and said to him What are these two olive trees
upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof


412 And I answered again and said to him What are the two olive
branches that are by the two golden beaks in which are the funnels of
gold

413 And he spoke to me saying Knowest thou not what these are And
I said No my lord

414 And he said These are two sons of oil who stand before the Lord
of the whole earth

Two sons of oil  That is the two anointed ones of the Lord viz
Jesus the high priest and Zorobabel the prince



Zacharias Chapter 5


The vision of the flying volume and of the woman in the vessel

51 And I turned and lifted up my eyes and I saw and behold a volume
flying

A volume  That is a parchment according to the form of the ancient
books which from being rolled up were called volumes

52 And he said to me What seest thou And I said I see a volume
flying the length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth thereof
ten cubits

53 And he said to me This is the curse that goeth forth over the
face of the earth for every thief shall be judged as is there written
and every one that sweareth in like manner shall be judged by it

54 I will bring it forth saith the Lord of hosts and it shall come
to the house of the thief and to the house of him that sweareth
falsely by my name and it shall remain in the midst of his house and
shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof

55 And the angel went forth that spoke in me and he said to me Lift
up thy eyes and see what this is that goeth forth

56 And I said What is it And he said This is a vessel going
forth And he said This is their eye in all the earth

This is their eye  This is what they fix their eye upon or this is a
resemblance and figure of them viz of sinners

57 And behold a talent of lead was carried and behold a woman
sitting in the midst of the vessel

58 And he said This is wickedness And he cast her into the midst of
the vessel and cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof

59 And I lifted up my eyes and looked and behold there came out two
women and wind was in their wings and they had wings like the wings
of a kite and they lifted up the vessel between the earth and the
heaven

510 And I said to the angel that spoke in me Whither do these carry
the vessel

511 And he said to me That a house may be built for it in the land
of Sennaar and that it may be established and set there upon its own
basis

The land of Sennaar  Where Babel or Babylon was built Gen 11
where note that Babylon in holy writ is often taken for the city of
the devil that is for the whole congregation of the wicked as
Jerusalem is taken for the city and people of God



Zacharias Chapter 6


The vision of the four chariots Crowns are ordered for Jesus the high
priest as a type of Christ

61 And I turned and lifted up my eyes and saw and behold four
chariots came out from the midst of two mountains and the mountains
were mountains of brass

Four chariots  The four great empires of the Chaldeans Persians
Grecians and Romans Or perhaps by the fourth chariot are represented
the kings of Egypt and of Asia the descendants of Ptolemeus and
Seleucus

62 In the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot
black horses

63 And in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot
grisled horses and strong ones

64 And I answered and said to the angel that spoke in me What are
these my lord

65 And the angel answered and said to me These are the four winds
of the heaven which go forth to stand before the Lord of all the
earth

66 That in which were the black horses went forth into the land of
the north and the white went forth after them and the grisled went
forth to the land the south

The land of the north  So Babylon is called because it lay to the
north in respect of Jerusalem The black horses that is the Medes and
Persians and after them Alexander and his Greeks signified by the
white horses went thither because they conquered Babylon executed
upon it the judgments of God which is signified ver 8 by the
expression of quieting his spiritIbid The land of the
south  Egypt which lay to the south of Jerusalem and was occupied
first by Ptolemeus and then by the Romans

67 And they that were most strong went out and sought to go and to
run to and fro through all the earth And he said Go walk throughout
the earth and they walked throughout the earth

68 And he called me and spoke to me saying Behold they that go
forth into the land of the north have quieted my spirit in the land of
the north

69 And the word of the Lord came to me saying

610 Take of them of the captivity of Holdai and of Tobias and of
Idaias thou shalt come in that day a shalt go into the house of
Josias the son of Sophonias who came out of Babylon

611 And thou shalt take gold and silver and shalt make crowns and
thou shalt set them on the head of Jesus the son of Josedec the high
priest

612 And thou shalt speak to him saying Thus saith the Lord of
hosts saying BEHOLD A MAN THE ORIENT IS HIS NAME and under him
shall he spring up a shall build a temple to the Lord

613 Yea he shall build a temple to the Lord and he shall bear the
glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne and he shall be a
priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace shall be between them
both

Between them both  That is he shall unite in himself the two offices
or dignities of king and priest

614 And the crowns shall be to Helem and Tobias and Idaias and to
Hem the son of Sophonias a memorial in the temple of the Lord

615 And they that are far off shall come and shall build in the
temple of the Lord and you shall know that the Lord of hosts sent me
to you But this shall come to pass if hearing you will hear the voice
of the Lord your God



Zacharias Chapter 7


The people inquire concerning fasting they are admonished to fast from
sin

71 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius that the
word of the Lord came to Zacharias in the fourth day of the ninth
month which is Casleu

72 When Sarasar and Rogommelech and the men that were with him
sent to the house of God to entreat the face of the Lord

73 To speak to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts and to
the prophets saying Must I weep in the fifth month or must I
sanctify myself as I have now done for many years

The fifth month  They fasted on the tenth day of the fifth month
because on that day the temple was burnt Therefore they inquire
whether they are to continue the fast after the temple is rebuilt See
this query answered in the 19th verse of the following chapter

74 And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me saying

75 Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests saying
When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and the seventh month for
these seventy years did you keep a fast unto me

76 And when you did eat and drink did you not eat for yourselves
and drink for yourselves

77 Are not these the words which the Lord spoke by the hand of the
former prophets when Jerusalem as yet was inhabited and was wealthy
both itself and the cities round about it and there were inhabitants
towards the south and in the plain

78 And the word of the Lord came to Zacharias saying

79 Thus saith the Lord of hosts saying Judge ye true judgment and
shew ye mercy and compassion every man to his brother

710 And oppress not the widow and the fatherless and the stranger
and the poor and let not a man devise evil in his heart against his
brother

711 But they would not hearken and they turned away the shoulder to
depart and they stopped their ears not to hear

712 And they made their heart as the adamant stone lest they should
hear the law and the words which the Lord of hosts sent in his spirit
by the hand of the former prophets so a great indignation came from
Lord of hosts

713 And it came to pass that as he spoke and they heard not so
shall they cry and I will not hear saith the Lord of hosts

714 And I dispersed them throughout all kingdoms which they know
not and the land was left desolate behind them so that no man passed
through or returned and they changed the delightful land into a
wilderness



Zacharias Chapter 8


Joyful promises to Jerusalem fully verified in the church of Christ

81 And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me saying

82 Thus saith the Lord of hosts I have been jealous for Sion with a
great jealousy and with a great indignation have I been jealous for
her

83 Thus saith the Lord of hosts I am returned to Sion and I will
dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and Jerusalem shall be called The city
of truth and the mountain of the Lord of hosts The sanctified
mountain

84 Thus saith the Lord of hosts There shall yet old men and old
women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem and every man with his staff
in his hand through multitude of days

85 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
playing in the streets thereof

86 Thus saith the Lord of hosts If it seem hard in the eyes of the
remnant of this people in those days shall it be hard in my eyes
saith the Lord of hosts

87 Thus saith the Lord of hosts Behold I will save my people from
the land of the east and from the land of the going down of the sun

88 And I will bring them and they shall dwell in the midst of
Jerusalem and they shall be my people and I will be their God in
truth and in justice

89 Thus saith the Lord of hosts Let your hands be strengthened you
that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets in
the day that the house of the Lord of hosts was founded that the
temple might be built

810 For before those days there was no hire for men neither was
there hire for beasts neither was there peace to him that came in nor
to him that went out because of the tribulation and I let all men go
every one against his neighbour

811 But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people according
to the former days saith the Lord of hosts

812 But there shall be the seed of peace the vine shall yield her
fruit and the earth shall give her increase and the heavens shall
give their dew and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess
all these things

813 And it shall come to pass that as you were a curse among the
Gentiles O house of Juda and house of Israel so will I save you and
you shall be a blessing fear not let your hands be strengthened

814 For thus saith the Lord of hosts As I purposed io afflict you
when your fathers had provoked me to wrath saith the Lord

815 And I had no mercy so turning again I have thought in these days
to do good to the house of Juda and Jerusalem fear not

816 These then are the things which you shall do Speak ye truth
every one to his neighbour judge ye truth and judgment of peace in
your gates

817 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
friend and love not a false oath for all these are the things that I
hate saith the Lord

818 And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me saying

819 Thus saith the Lord of hosts The fast of the fourth month and
the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the
tenth shall be to the house of Juda joy and gladness and great
solemnities only love ye truth and peace

The fast of the fourth month etc  They fasted on the ninth day of
the fourth month because on that day Nabuchodonosor took Jerusalem
Jer 526 On the tenth day of the fifth month because on that day the
temple was burnt Jer 5212 On the third day of the seventh month
for the murder of Godolias Jer 412 And on the tenth day of the
tenth month because on that day the Chaldeans began to besiege
Jerusalem 4 Kings 251 All these fasts if they will be obedient for
the future shall be changed as is here promised into joyful
solemnities

820 Thus saith the Lord of hosts until people come and dwell in many
cities

821 And the inhabitants go one to another saying Let us go and
entreat the face of the Lord and let us seek the Lord of hosts I also
will go

822 And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord
of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the face of the Lord

823 Thus saith the Lord of hosts In those days wherein ten men of
all languages of the Gentiles shall take hold and shall hold fast the
skirt of one that is a Jew saying We will go with you for we have
heard that God is with you

Ten men etc  Many of the Gentiles became proselytes to the Jewish
religion before Christ but many more were converted to Christ by the
apostles and other preachers of the Jewish nation



Zacharias Chapter 9


God will defend his church and bring over even her enemies to the
faith The meek coming of Christ to bring peace to deliver the
captives by his blood and to give us all good things

91 The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach and of
Damascus the rest thereof for the eye of man and of all the tribes of
Israel is the Lords

Hadrach  Syria

92 Emath also in the borders thereof and Tyre and Sidon for they
have taken to themselves to be exceeding wise

93 And Tyre hath built herself a strong hold and heaped together
silver as earth and gold as the mire of the streets

94 Behold the Lord shall possess her and shall strike her strength
in the sea and she shall be devoured with fire

95 Ascalon shall see and shall fear and Gaza and shall be very
sorrowful and Accaron because her hope is confounded and the king
shall perish from Gaza and Ascalon shall not be inhabited

96 And the divider shall sit in Azotus and I will destroy the pride
of the Philistines

97 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth and his
abominations from between his teeth and even he shall be left to our
God and he shall be as a governor in Juda and Accaron as a Jebusite

His blood  It is spoken of the Philistines and particularly of
Azotus where the temple of Dagon was and contains a prophecy of the
conversion of that people from their bloody sacrifices and abominations
to the worship of the true God

98 And I will encompass my house with them that serve me in war
going and returning and the oppressor shall no more pass through them
for now I have seen with my eyes

That serve me in war  Viz the Machabees

99 Rejoice greatly O daughter of Sion shout for joy O daughter of
Jerusalem BEHOLD THY KING will come to thee the just and saviour he
is poor and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass

910 And I will destroy the chariot out of Ephraim and the horse out
of Jerusalem and the bow for war shall be broken and he shall speak
peace to the Gentiles and his power shall be from sea to sea and from
the rivers even to the end of the earth

911 Thou also by the blood of thy testament hast sent forth thy
prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water

912 Return to the strong hold ye prisoners of hope I will render
thee double as I declare today

913 Because I have bent Juda for me as a bow I have filled Ephraim
and I will raise up thy sons O Sion above thy sons O Greece and I
will make thee as the sword of the mighty

Thy sons O Sion etc  Viz the apostles who in the spiritual way
conquered the Greeks and subdued them to Christ

914 And the Lord God shall be seen over them and his dart shall go
forth as lightning and the Lord God will sound the trumpet and go in
the whirlwind of the south

915 The Lord of hosts will protect them and they shall devour and
subdue with the stones of the sling and drinking they shall be
inebriated as it were with wine and they shall be filled as bowls and
as the horns of the altar

916 And the Lord their God will save them in that day as the flock
of his people for holy stones shall be lifted up over his land

Holy stones  The apostles who shall be as pillars and monuments in
the church

917 For what is the good thing of him and what is his beautiful
thing but the corn of the elect and wine springing forth virgins

The corn etc  His most excellent gift is the blessed Eucharist
called here The corn that is the bread of the elect and the wine
springing forth virgins that is maketh virgins to bud or spring
forth as it were like flowers among thorns because it has a
wonderful efficacy to give and preserve purity



Zacharias Chapter 10


God is to be sought to and not idols The victories of his church
which shall arise originally from the Jewish nation

101 Ask ye of the Lord rain in the latter season and the Lord will
make snows and will give them showers of rain to every one grass in
the field

102 For the idols have spoken what was unprofitable and the diviners
have seen a lie and the dreamers have spoken vanity they comforted in
vain therefore they were led away as a flock they shall be afflicted
because they have no shepherd

103 My wrath is kindled against the shepherds and I will visit upon
the buck goats for the Lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house
of Juda and hath made them as the horse of his glory in the battle

104 Out of him shall come forth the corner out of him the pin out
of him the bow of battle out of him ever exacter together

105 And they shall be as mighty men treading under foot the mire of
the ways in battle and they shall fight because the Lord is with
them and the riders of horses shall be confounded

106 And I will strengthen the house of Juda and save the house of
Joseph and I will bring them back again because I will have mercy on
them and they shall be as they were when I had not cast them off for
I am the Lord their God and will hear them

107 And they shall be as the valiant men of Ephraim and their heart
shall rejoice as through wine and their children shall see and shall
rejoice and their heart shall be joyful in the Lord

108 I will whistle for them and I will gather them together because
I have redeemed them and I will multiply them as they were multiplied
before

109 And I will sow them among peoples and from afar they shall
remember me and they shall live with their children and shall return

1010 And I will bring them back out of the land of Egypt and I will
gather them from among the Assyrians and will bring them to the land
of Galaad and Libanus and place shall not be found for them

1011 And he shall pass over the strait of the sea and shall strike
the waves in the sea and all the depths of the river shall be
confounded and the pride of Assyria shall be humbled and the sceptre
of Egypt shall depart

1012 I will strengthen them in the Lord and they shall walk in his
name saith the Lord



Zacharias Chapter 11


The destruction of Jerusalem and the temple Gods dealings with the
Jews and their reprobation

111 Open thy gates O Libanus and let fire devour thy cedars

O Libanus  So Jerusalem and more particularly the temple is called
by the prophets from its height and from its being built of the
cedars of LibanusIbid Thy cedars  Thy princes and chief men

112 Howl thou fir tree for the cedar is fallen for the mighty are
laid waste howl ye oaks of Basan because the fenced forest is cut
down

113 The voice of the howling of the shepherds because their glory is
laid waste the voice of the roaring of the lions because the pride of
the Jordan is spoiled

114 Thus saith the Lord my God Feed the flock of the slaughter

115 Which they that possessed slew and repented not and they sold
them saying Blessed be the Lord we are become rich and their
shepherds spared them not

116 And I will no more spare the inhabitants of the land saith the
Lord behold I will deliver the men every one into his neighbours
hand and into the hand of his king and they shall destroy the land
and I will not deliver it out of their hand

Every one into his neighbours hand etc  This alludes to the last
siege of Jerusalem in which the different factions of the Jews
destroyed one another and they that remained fell into the hands of
their king that is of the Roman emperor of whom they had said John
1915 we have no king but Caesar

117 And I will feed the flock of slaughter for this O ye poor of the
flock And I took unto me two rods one I called Beauty and the other
I called a Cord and I fed the flock

Two rods  Or shepherds staves meaning the different ways of Gods
dealing with his people the one by sweet means called the rod of
Beauty the other by bands and punishments called the Cord And where
both these rods are made of no use or effect by the obstinacy of
sinners the rods are broken and such sinners are given up to a
reprobate sense as the Jews were

118 And I cut off three shepherds in one month and my soul was
straitened in their regard for their soul also varied in my regard

Three shepherds in one month  That is in a very short time By these
three shepherds probably are meant the latter princes and high priests
of the Jews whose reign was short

119 And I said I will not feed you that which dieth let it die
and that which is cut off let it be cut off and let the rest devour
every one the flesh of his neighbour

1110 And I took my rod that was called Beauty and I cut it asunder
to make void my covenant which I had made with all people

1111 And it was made void in that day and so the poor of the flock
that keep for me understood that it is the word of the Lord

1112 And I said to them If it be good in your eyes bring hither my
wages and if not be quiet And they weighed for my wages thirty
pieces of silver

1113 And the Lord said to me Cast it to the statuary a handsome
price that I was prized at by them And I took the thirty pieces of
silver and I cast them into the house of the Lord to the statuary

The statuary  The Hebrew word signifies also a potter

1114 And I cut off my second rod that was called a Cord that I might
break the brotherhood between Juda and Israel

1115 And the Lord said to me Take to thee yet the instruments of a
foolish shepherd

A foolish shepherd  This was to represent the foolish that is the
wicked princes and priests that should rule the people before their
utter desolation

1116 For behold I will raise up a shepherd in the land who shall not
visit what is forsaken nor seek what is scattered nor heal what is
broken nor nourish that which standeth and he shall eat the flesh of
the fat ones and break their hoofs

1117 O shepherd and idol that forsaketh the flock the sword upon
his arm and upon his right eye his arm shall quite wither away and
his right eye shall be utterly darkened



Zacharias Chapter 12


God shall protect his church against her persecutors The mourning of
Jerusalem

121 The burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel Thus saith the
Lord who stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundations of
the earth and formeth the spirit of man in him

122 Behold I will make Jerusalem a lintel of surfeiting to all the
people round about and Juda also shall be in the siege against
Jerusalem

A lintel of surfeiting  That is a door into which they shall seek to
enter to glut themselves with blood but they shall stumble and fall
like men stupefied with wine It seems to allude to the times of
Antiochus and to the victories of the Machabees

123 And it shall come to pass in that day that I will make Jerusalem
a burdensome stone to all people all that shall lift it up shall be
rent and torn and all the kingdoms of the earth shall be gathered
together against her

124 In that day saith the Lord I will strike every horse with
astonishment and his rider with madness and I will open my eyes upon
the house of Juda and will strike every horse of the nations with
blindness

125 And the governors of Juda shall say in their heart Let the
inhabitants of Jerusalem be strengthened for me in the Lord of hosts
their God

126 In that day I will make the governors of Juda like a furnace of
fire amongst wood and as a firebrand amongst hay and they shall
devour all the people round about to the right hand and to the left
and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place in Jerusalem

127 And the Lord shall save the tabernacles of Jada as in the
beginning that the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem may not boast and magnify themselves against Juda

128 In that day shall the Lord protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem
and he that hath offended among them in that day shall be as David and
the house of David as that of God as an angel of the Lord in their
sight

129 And it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to
destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem

1210 And I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the
inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of prayers and they
shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for
him as one mourneth for an only son and they shall grieve over him as
the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn

1211 In that day there shall be a great lamentation in Jerusalem like
the lamentation of Adadremmon in the plain of Mageddon

Adadremmon  A place near Mageddon where the good king Josias was
slain and much lamented by his people

1212 And the land shall mourn families and families apart the
families of the house of David apart and their women apart

1213 The families of the house of Nathan apart and their women
apart the families of the house of Levi apart and their women apart
the families of Semei apart and their women apart

1214 All the rest of the families families and families apart and
their women apart



Zacharias Chapter 13


The fountain of Christ Idols and false prophets shall be extirpated
Christ shall suffer his people shall be tried by fire

131 In that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of David
and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for the washing of the sinner and
of the unclean woman

132 And it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord of hosts
that I will destroy the names of idols out of the earth and they shall
be remembered no more and I will take away the false prophets and the
unclean spirit out of the earth

133 And it shall come to pass that when any man shall prophesy any
more his father and his mother that brought him into the world shall
say to him Thou shalt not live because thou hast spoken a lie in the
name of the Lord And his father and his mother his parents shall
thrust him through when he shall prophesy

134 And it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be
confounded every one by his own vision when he shall prophesy
neither shall they be clad with a garment of sackcloth to deceive

135 But he shall say I am no prophet I am a husbandman for Adam is
my example from my youth

136 And they shall say to him What are these wounds in the midst of
thy hands And he shall say With these I was wounded in the house of
them that loved me

137 Awake O sword against my shepherd and against the man that
cleaveth to me saith the Lord of hosts strike the shepherd and the
sheep shall be scattered and I will turn my hand to the little ones

138 And there shall be in all the earth saith the Lord two parts in
it shall be scattered and shall perish but the third part shall be
left therein

139 And I will bring the third part through the fire and will refine
them as silver is refined and I will try them as gold is tried They
shall call on my name and I will hear them I will say Thou art my
people and they shall say The Lord is my God



Zacharias Chapter 14


After the persecutions of the church shall follow great prosperity
Persecutors shall be punished so shall all that will not serve God in
his church

141 Behold the days of the Lord shall come and thy spoils shall be
divided in the midst of thee

142 And I will gather all nations to Jerusalem to battle and the
city shall be taken and the houses shall be rifled and the women
shall be defiled and half of the city shall go forth into captivity
and the rest of the people shall not be taken away out of the city

I will gather etc  This seems to be a prophecy of what was done by
Antiochus

143 Then the Lord shall go forth and shall fight against those
nations as when he fought in the day of battle

144 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives
which is over against Jerusalem towards the east and the mount of
Olives shall be divided in the midst thereof to the east and to the
west with a very great opening and half of the mountain shall be
separated to the north and half thereof to the south

145 And you shall flee to the valley of those mountains for the
valley of the mountains shall be joined even to the next and you shall
flee as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the days of Ozias
king of Juda and the Lord my God shall come and all the saints with
him

146 And it shall come to pass in that day that there shall be no
light but cold and frost

No light  Viz in that dismal time of persecution of Antiochus when
it was neither day nor night ver 7 because they neither had the
comfortable light of the day nor the repose of the night

147 And there shall be one day which is known to the Lord not day
nor night and in the time of the evening there shall be light

In the time of the evening there shall be light  An unexpected light
shall arise by the means of the Machabees when things shall seem to be
at the worst

148 And it shall come to pass in that day that living waters shall
go out from Jerusalem half of them to the east sea and half of them
to the last sea they shall be in summer and in winter

Living waters  Viz the gospel of Christ

149 And the Lord shall be king over all the earth in that day there
shall be one Lord and his name shall be one

1410 And all the land shall return even to the desert from the hill
to Remmon to the south of Jerusalem and she shall be exalted and
shall dwell in her own place from the gate of Benjamin even to the
place of the former gate and even to the gate of the corners and from
the tower of Hananeel even to the kings winepresses

All the land shall return etc  This in some measure was verified
by the means of the Machabees but is rather to be taken in a spiritual
sense as relating to the propagation of the church and kingdom of
Christ the true Jerusalem which alone shall never fall under the
anathema of destruction or Gods curse

1411 And people shall dwell in it and there shall be no more an
anathema but Jerusalem shall sit secure

1412 And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord shall strike all
nations that have fought against Jerusalem the flesh of every one
shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes
shall consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away
in their mouth

The flesh of every one shall consume etc  Such judgments as these
have often fallen upon the persecutors of Gods church as appears by
many instances in history

1413 In that day there shall be a great tumult from the Lord among
them and a man shall take the hand of his neighbour and his hand
shall be clasped upon his neighbours hand

1414 And even Juda shall fight against Jerusalem and the riches of
all nations round about shall be gathered together gold and silver
and garments in great abundance

Even Juda etc  The carnal Jews and other false brothers shall join
in persecuting the church

1415 And the destruction of the horse and of the mule and of the
camel and of the ass and of all the beasts that shall be in those
tents shall be like this destruction

Shall be like this destruction  That is the beasts shall be
destroyed as well as the men the common soldiers as well as their
leaders

1416 And all they that shall be left of all nations that came against
Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to adore the King the Lord
of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles

They that shall be left etc  That is many of them that persecuted
the church shall be converted to its faith and communionIbid To keep
the feast of tabernacles  This feast was kept by the Jews in memory
of their sojourning forty years in the desert in their way to the land
of promise And in the spiritual sense is duly kept by all such
Christians as in their earthly pilgrimage are continually advancing
toward their true home the heavenly Jerusalem by the help of the
sacraments and sacrifice of the church And they that neglect this must
not look for the kind showers of divine grace to give fruitfulness to
their souls

1417 And it shall come to pass that he that shall not go up of the
families of the land to Jerusalem to adore the King the Lord of
hosts there shall be no rain upon them

1418 And if the family of Egypt go not up nor come neither shall it
be upon them but there shall be destruction wherewith the Lord will
strike all nations that will not go up to keep the feast of
tabernacles

1419 This shall be the sin of Egypt and this the sin of all nations
that will not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles

1420 In that day that which is upon the bridle of the horse shall be
holy to the Lord and the caldrons in the house of the Lord shall be as
the phials before the altar

That which is upon the bridle etc  The golden ornaments of the
bridles etc shall be turned into offerings in the house of God And
there shall be an abundance of caldrons and phials for the sacrifices
of the temple by which is meant under a figure the great resort
there shall be to the temple that is to the church of Christ and her
sacrifice

1421 And every caldron in Jerusalem and Juda shall be sanctified to
the Lord of hosts and all that sacrifice shall come and take of them
and shall seethe in them and the merchant shall be no more in the
house of the Lord of hosts in that day

The merchant shall be no more etc  Or as some render it The
Chanaanite shall be no more etc that is the profane and unbelievers
shall have no title to be in the house of the Lord Or there shall be
no occasion for buyers or sellers of oxen or sheep or doves in the
house of God such as Jesus Christ cast out of the temple




THE PROPHECY OF MALACHIAS



MALACHIAS whose name signifies The Angel of the Lord was contemporary
with NEHEMIAS and by some is believed to have been the same person as
ESDRAS He was the last of the prophets in the order of time and
flourished about four hundred years before Christ He foretells the
coming of Christ the reprobation of the Jews and their sacrifices and
the calling of the Gentiles who shall offer up to God in every place
an acceptable sacrifice



Malachias Chapter 1


God reproaches the Jews with their ingratitude and the priests for not
offering pure sacrifices He will accept of the sacrifice that shall be
offered in every place among the Gentiles

11 The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by the hand of
Malachias

12 I have loved you saith the Lord and you have said Wherein hast
thou loved us Was not Esau brother to Jacob saith the Lord and I
have loved Jacob

I have loved Jacob etc  I have preferred his posterity to make them
my chosen people and to lead them with my blessings without any merit
on their part and though they have been always ungrateful whilst I
have rejected Esau and executed severe judgments upon his posterity
Not that God punished Esau or his posterity beyond their desert but
that by his free election and grace he loved Jacob and favoured his
posterity above their deserts See the annotations upon Rom 9

13 But have hated Esau and I have made his mountains a wilderness
and given his inheritance to the dragons of the desert

14 But if Edom shall say We are destroyed but we will return and
build up what hath been destroyed thus saith the Lord of hosts They
shall build up and I will throw down and they shall be called the
borders of wickedness and the people with whom the Lord is angry for
ever

15 And your eyes shall see and you shall say The Lord be magnified
upon the border of Israel

16 The son honoureth the father and the servant his master if then
I be a father where is my honour and if I be a master where is my
fear saith the Lord of hosts

17 To you O priests that despise my name and have said Wherein
have we despised thy name You offer polluted bread upon my altar and
you say Wherein have we polluted thee In that you say The table of
the Lord is contemptible

18 If you offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if you
offer the lame and the sick is it not evil offer it to thy prince if
he will be pleased with it or if he will regard thy face saith the
Lord of hosts

19 And now beseech ye the face of God that he may have mercy on you
for by your hand hath this been done if by any means he will receive
your faces saith the Lord of hosts

110 Who is there among you that will shut the doors and will kindle
the fire on my altar gratis I have no pleasure in you saith the Lord
of hosts and I will not receive a gift of your hand

111 For from the rising of the sun even to the going down my name is
great among the Gentiles and in every place there is sacrifice and
there is offered to my name a clean oblation for my name is great
among the Gentiles saith the Lord of hosts

A clean oblation  Viz the precious body and blood of Christ in the
eucharistic sacrifice

112 And you have profaned it in that you say The table of the Lord
is defiled and that which is laid thereupon is contemptible with the
fire that devoureth it

113 And you have said Behold of our labour and you puffed it away
saith the Lord of hosts and you brought in of rapine the lame and the
sick and brought in an offering shall I accept it at your hands
saith the Lord

Behold of our labour etc  You pretended labour and weariness when
you brought your offering and so made it of no value by offering it
with an evil mind Moreover what you offered was both defective in
itself and gotten by rapine and extortion

114 Cursed is the deceitful man that hath in his flock a male and
making a vow offereth in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord
for I am a great King saith the Lord of hosts and my name is dreadful
among the Gentiles



Malachias Chapter 2


The priests are sharply reproved for neglecting their covenant The
evil of marrying with idolaters and too easily putting away their
wives

21 And now O ye priests this commandment is to you

22 If you will not hear and if you will not lay it to heart to give
glory to my name saith the Lord of hosts I will send poverty upon
you and will curse your blessings yea I will curse them because you
have not laid it to heart

23 Behold I will cast the shoulder to you and will scatter upon
your face the dung of your solemnities and it shall take you away with
it

I will cast the shoulder to you  I will cast away the shoulder which
in the law was appointed to be your portion and fling it at you in my
anger and will reject both you and your festivals like dung

24 And you shall know that I sent you this commandment that my
covenant might be with Levi saith the Lord of hosts

25 My covenant was with him of life and peace and I gave him fear
and he feared me and he was afraid before my name

26 The law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in
his lips he walked with me in peace and in equity and turned many
away from iniquity

27 For the lips of the priests shall keep knowledge and they shall
seek the law at his mouth because he is the angel of the Lord of
hosts

The angel  Viz the minister and messenger

28 But you have departed out of the way and have caused many to
stumble at the law you have made void the covenant of Levi saith the
Lord of hosts

29 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all
people as you have not kept my ways and have accepted persons in the
law

210 Have we not all one father hath not one God created us why then
doth every one of us despise his brother violating the covenant of our
fathers

211 Juda hath transgressed and abomination hath been committed in
Israel and in Jerusalem for Juda hath profaned the holiness of the
Lord which he loved and hath married the daughter of a strange god

212 The Lord will cut off the man that hath done this both the
master and the scholar out of the tabernacles of Jacob and him that
offereth an offering to the Lord of hosts

213 And this again have you done you have covered the altar of the
Lord with tears with weeping and bellowing so that I have no more a
regard to sacrifice neither do I accept any atonement at your hands

With tears  Viz by occasion of your wives whom you have put away
and who came to weep and lament before the altar

214 And you have said For what cause Because the Lord hath been
witness between thee and the wife of thy youth whom thou hast
despised yet she was thy partner and the wife of thy covenant

215 Did not one make her and she is the residue of his spirit And
what doth one seek but the seed of God Keep then your spirit and
despise not the wife of thy youth

216 When thou shalt hate her put her away saith the Lord the God of
Israel but iniquity shalt cover his garment saith the Lord of hosts
keep your spirit and despise not

Iniquity shall cover his garment  Viz of every man that putteth
away his wife without just cause notwithstanding that God permitted it
in the law to prevent the evil of murder

217 You have wearied the Lord with your words and you said Wherein
have we wearied him In that you say Every one that doth evil is good
in the sight of the Lord and such please him or surely where is the
God of judgment



Malachias Chapter 3


Christ shall come to his temple and purify the priesthood They that
continue in their evil ways shall be punished but true penitents shall
receive a blessing

31 Behold I send my angel and he shall prepare the way before my
face And presently the Lord whom you seek and the angel of the
testament whom you desire shall come to his temple Behold he
cometh saith the Lord of hosts

My angel  Viz John the Baptist the messenger of God and
forerunner of Christ

32 And who shall be able to think of the day of his coming and who
shall stand to see him for he is like a refining fire and like the
fullers herb

33 And he shall sit refining and cleansing the silver and he shall
purify the sons of Levi and shall refine them as gold and as silver
and they shall offer sacrifices to the Lord in justice

34 And the sacrifice of Juda and of Jerusalem shall please the Lord
as in the days of old and in the ancient years

35 And I will come to you in judgment and will be a speedy witness
against sorcerers and adulterers and false swearers and them that
oppress the hireling in his wages the widows and the fatherless and
oppress the stranger and have not feared me saith the Lord of hosts

36 For I am the Lord and I change not and you the sons of Jacob are
not consumed

37 For from the days of your fathers you have departed from my
ordinances and have not kept them Return to me and I will return to
you saith the Lord of hosts And you have said Wherein shall we
return

38 Shall a man afflict God for you afflict me And you have said
Wherein do we afflict thee in tithes and in firstfruits

39 And you are cursed with want and you afflict me even the whole
nation of you

310 Bring all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat
in my house and try me in this saith the Lord if I open not unto you
the floodgates of heaven and pour you out a blessing even to
abundance

311 And I will rebuke for your sakes the devourer and he shall not
spoil the fruit of your land neither shall the vine in the field be
barren saith the Lord of hosts

312 And all nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a
delightful land saith the Lord of hosts

313 Your words have been unsufferable to me saith the Lord

314 And you have said What have we spoken against thee You have
said He laboureth in vain that serveth God and what profit is it that
we have kept his ordinances and that we have walked sorrowful before
the Lord of hosts

315 Wherefore now we call the proud people happy for they that work
wickedness are built up and they have tempted God and are preserved

316 Then they that feared the Lord spoke every one with his
neighbour and the Lord gave ear and heard it and a book of
remembrance was written before him for them that fear the Lord and
think on his name

317 And they shall be my special possession saith the Lord of hosts
in the day that I do judgment and I will spare them as a man spareth
his son that serveth him

318 And you shall return and shall see the difference between the
just and the wicked and between him that serveth God and him that
serveth him not



Malachias Chapter 4


The judgment of the wicked and reward of the just An exhortation to
observe the law Elias shall come for the conversion of the Jews

41 For behold the day shall come kindled as a furnace and all the
proud and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that
cometh shall set them on fire saith the Lord of hosts it shall not
leave them root nor branch

42 But unto you that fear my name the Sun of justice shall arise
and health in his wings and you shall go forth and shall leap like
calves of the herd

43 And you shall tread down the wicked when they shall be ashes under
the sole of your feet in the day that I do this saith the Lord of
hosts

44 Remember the law of Moses my servant which I commanded him in
Horeb for all Israel the precepts and judgments

45 Behold I will send you Elias the prophet before the coming of
the great and dreadful day of the Lord

46 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and
the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and strike the
earth with anathema

He shall turn the heart etc  By bringing over the Jews to the faith
of Christ he shall reconcile them to their fathers viz the
partiarchs and prophets whose hearts for many ages have been turned
away from them because of their refusing to believe in ChristIbid
With anathema  In the Hebrew Cherem that is with utter
destruction




THE FIRST BOOK OF MACHABEES



These books are so called because they contain the history of the
people of God under the command of Judas Machabeus and his brethren
and he as some will have it was surnamed Machabeus from carrying in
his ensigns or standards those words of Exodus 1511 Who is like to
thee among the strong O Lord in which the initial letters in the
Hebrew are M C B E I It is not known who is the author of these
books But as to their authority though they are not received by the
Jews saith St Augustine lib 18 De Civ Dei c 36 they are
received by the church who in settling her canon of the scriptures
chose rather to be directed by the tradition she had received from the
apostles of Christ than by that of the scribes and Pharisees And as
the church has declared these two Books canonical even in two general
councils viz Florence and Trent there can be no doubt of their
authenticity



1 Machabees Chapter 1


The reign of Alexander and his successors Antiochus rifles and
profanes the temple of God and persecutes unto death all that will not
forsake the law of God and the religion of their fathers

11 Now it came to pass after that Alexander the son of Philip the
Macedonian who first reigned in Greece coming out of the land of
Cethim had overthrown Darius king of the Persians and Medes

12 He fought many battles and took the strong holds of all and slew
the kings of the earth

13 And he went through even to the ends of the earth and took the
spoils of many nations and the earth was quiet before him

14 And he gathered a power and a very strong army and his heart was
exalted and lifted up

15 And he subdued countries of nations and princes and they became
tributaries to him

16 And after these things he fell down upon his bed and knew that
he should die

17 And he called his servants the nobles that were brought up with
him from his youth and he divided his kingdom among them while he was
yet alive

Divided his kingdom etc  This is otherwise related by Q Curtius
though he acknowledges that divers were of that opinion and that it
had been delivered by some authors lib 10 But here we find from the
sacred text that he was in error

18 And Alexander reigned twelve years and he died

19 And his servants made themselves kings every one in his place

110 And they all put crowns upon themselves after his death and
their sons after them many years and evils were multiplied in the
earth

111 And there came out of them a wicked root Antiochus the
Illustrious the son of king Antiochus who had been a hostage at Rome
and he reigned in the hundred and thirtyseventh year of the kingdom of
the Greeks

Antiochus the Illustrius  Epiphanes the younger son of Antiochus the
Great who usurped the kingdom to the prejudice of his nephew
Demetrius son of his elder brother Seleucus PhilopaterIbid Of the
kingdom of the Greeks  Counting not from the beginning of the reign
of Alexander but from the first year of Seleucus Nicator

112 In those days there went out of Israel wicked men and they
persuaded many saying Let us go and make a covenant with the heathens
that are round about us for since we departed from them many evils
have befallen us

113 And the word seemed good in their eyes

114 And some of the people determined to do this and went to the
king and he gave them license to do after the ordinances of the
heathens

115 And they built a place of exercise in Jerusalem according to the
laws of the nations

116 And they made themselves prepuces and departed from the holy
covenant and joined themselves to the heathens and were sold to do
evil

117 And the kingdom was established before Antiochus and he had a
mind to reign over the land of Egypt that he might reign over two
kingdoms

118 And he entered into Egypt with a great multitude with chariots
and elephants and horsemen and a great number of ships

119 And he made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt but Ptolemee was
afraid at his presence and fled and many were wounded unto death

120 And he took the strong cities in the land of Egypt and he took
the spoils of the land of Egypt

121 And after Antiochus had ravaged Egypt in the hundred and
fortythird year he returned and went up against Israel

122 And he went up to Jerusalem with a great multitude

123 And he proudly entered into the sanctuary and took away the
golden altar and the candlestick of light and all the vessels
thereof and the table of proposition and the pouring vessels and the
vials and the little mortars of gold and the veil and the crowns
and the golden ornament that was before the temple and he broke them
all in pieces

124 And he took the silver and gold and the precious vessels and he
took the hidden treasures which he found and when he had taken all
away he departed into his own country

125 And he made a great slaughter of men and spoke very proudly

126 And there was great mourning in Israel and in every place where
they were

127 And the princes and the ancients mourned and the virgins and
the young men were made feeble and the beauty of the women was
changed

128 Every bridegroom took up lamentation and the bride that sat in
the marriage bed mourned

129 And the land was moved for the inhabitants thereof and all the
house of Jacob was covered with confusion

130 And after two full years the king sent the chief collector of
his tributes to the cities of Juda and he came to Jerusalem with a
great multitude

The chief collector etc  Apollonius

131 And he spoke to them peaceable words in deceit and they believed
him

132 And he fell upon the city suddenly and struck it with a great
slaughter and destroyed much people in Israel

133 And he took the spoils of the city and burnt it with fire and
threw down the houses thereof and the walls thereof round about

134 And they took the women captive and the children and the cattle
they possessed

135 And they built the city of David with a great and strong wall
and with strong towers and made it a fortress for them

The city of David  That is the castle of Sion

136 And they placed there a sinful nation wicked men and they
fortified themselves therein and they stored up armour and victuals
and gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem

137 And laid them up there and they became a great snare

138 And this was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary and an
evil devil in Israel

An evil devil  That is an adversary watching constantly to do harm
as the evil spirit is always watching and seeking whom he may devour

139 And they shed innocent blood round about the sanctuary and
defiled the holy place

140 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled away by reason of them and
the city was made the habitation of strangers and she became a
stranger to her own seed and her children forsook her

141 Her sanctuary was desolate like a wilderness her festival days
were turned into mourning her sabbaths into reproach her honours were
brought to nothing

142 Her dishonour was increased according to her glory and her
excellency was turned into mourning

143 And king Antiochus wrote to all his kingdom that all the people
should be one and every one should leave his own law

144 And all nations consented according to the word of king
Antiochus

145 And many of Israel consented to his service and they sacrificed
to idols and profaned the sabbath

146 And the king sent letters by the hands of messengers to
Jerusalem and to all the cities of Juda that they should follow the
law of the nations of the earth

147 And should forbid holocausts and sacrifices and atonements to be
made in the temple of God

148 And should prohibit the sabbath and the festival days to be
celebrated

149 And he commanded the holy places to be profaned and the holy
people of Israel

150 And he commanded altars to be built and temples and idols and
swines flesh to be immolated and unclean beasts

151 And that they should leave their children uncircumcised and let
their souls be defiled with all uncleannesses and abominations to the
end that they should forget the law and should change all the
justifications of God

152 And that whosoever would not do according to the word of king
Antiochus should be put to death

153 According to all these words he wrote to his whole kingdom and
he appointed rulers over the people that should force them to do these
things

154 And they commanded the cities of Juda to sacrifice

155 Then many of the people were gathered to them that had forsaken
the law of the Lord and they committed evils in the land

156 And they drove away the people of Israel into lurking holes and
into the secret places of fugitives

157 On the fifteenth day of the month Casleu in the hundred and
fortyfifth year king Antiochus set up the abominable idol of
desolation upon the altar of God and they built altars throughout all
the cities of Juda round about

The abominable idol etc  Viz the statue of Jupiter Olympius

158 And they burnt incense and sacrificed at the doors of the houses
and in the streets

159 And they cut in pieces and burnt with fire the books of the law
of God

160 And every one with whom the books of the testament of the Lord
were found and whosoever observed the law of the Lord they put to
death according to the edict of the king

161 Thus by their power did they deal with the people of Israel that
were found in the cities month after month

162 And on the five and twentieth day of the month they sacrificed
upon the altar of the idol that was over against the altar of God

163 Now the women that circumcised their children were slain
according to the commandment of king Antiochus

164 And they hanged the children about their neck in all their
houses and those that had circumcised them they put to death

165 And many of the people of Israel determined with themselves that
they would not eat unclean things and they chose rather to die than
to be defiled with unclean meats

166 And they would not break the holy law of God and they were put to
death

167 And there was very great wrath upon the people



1 Machabees Chapter 2


The zeal and success of Mathathias His exhortation to his sons at his
death

21 In those days arose Mathathias the son of John the son of
Simeon a priest of the sons of Joarib from Jerusalem and he abode in
the mountain of Modin

22 And he had five sons John who was surnamed Gaddis

23 And Simon who was surnamed Thasi

24 And Judas who was called Machabeus

25 And Eleazar who was surnamed Abaron and Jonathan who was
surnamed Apphus

26 These saw the evils that were done in the people of Juda and in
Jerusalem

27 And Mathathias said Woe is me wherefore was I born to see the
ruin of my people and the ruin of the holy city and to dwell there
when it is given into the hands of the enemies

28 The holy places are come into the hands of strangers her temple is
become as a man without honour

29 The vessels of her glory are carried away captive her old men are
murdered in the streets and her young men are fallen by the sword of
the enemies

210 What nation hath not inherited her kingdom and gotten of her
spoils

211 All her ornaments are taken away She that was free is made a
slave

212 And behold our sanctuary and our beauty and our glory is laid
waste and the Gentiles have defiled them

213 To what end then should we live any longer

214 And Mathathias and his sons rent their garments and they covered
themselves with haircloth and made great lamentation

215 And they that were sent from king Antiochus came thither to
compel them that were fled into the city of Modin to sacrifice and to
burn incense and to depart from the law of God

216 And many of the people of Israel consented and came to them but
Mathathias and his sons stood firm

217 And they that were sent from Antiochus answering said to
Mathathias Thou art a ruler and an honourable and great man in this
city and adorned with sons and brethren

218 Therefore come thou first and obey the kings commandment as
all nations have done and the men of Juda and they that remain in
Jerusalem and thou and thy sons shall be in the number of the kings
friends and enriched with gold and silver and many presents

219 Then Mathathias answered and said with a loud voice Although all
nations obey king Antiochus so as to depart every man from the service
of the law of his fathers and consent to his commandments

220 I and my sons and my brethren will obey the law of our fathers

221 God be merciful unto us it is not profitable for us to forsake
the law and the justices of God

222 We will not hearken to the words of king Antiochus neither will
we sacrifice and transgress the commandments of our law to go another
way

223 Now as he left off speaking these words there came a certain Jew
in the sight of all to sacrifice to the idols upon the altar in the
city of Modin according to the kings commandment

224 And Mathathias saw and was grieved and his reins trembled and
his wrath was kindled according to the judgment of the law and running
upon him he slew him upon the altar

225 Moreover the man whom king Antiochus had sent who compelled them
to sacrifice he slew at the same time and pulled down the altar

226 And shewed zeal for the law as Phinees did by Zamri the son of
Salomi

227 And Mathathias cried out in the city with a loud voice saying
Every one that hath zeal for the law and maintaineth the testament
let him follow me

228 So he and his sons fled into the mountains and left all that
they had in the city

229 Then many that sought after judgment and justice went down into
the desert

230 And they abode there they and their children and their wives
and their cattle because afflictions increased upon them

231 And it was told to the kings men and to the army that was in
Jerusalem in the city of David that certain men who had broken the
kings commandment were gone away into the secret places in the
wilderness and that many were gone after them

232 And forthwith they went out towards them and made war against
them on the sabbath day

233 And they said to them Do you still resist come forth and do
according to the edict of king Antiochus and you shall live

234 And they said We will not come forth neither will we obey the
kings edict to profane the sabbath day

235 And they made haste to give them battle

236 But they answered them not neither did they cast a stone at
them nor stopped up the secret places

237 Saying Let us all die in our innocency and heaven and earth
shall be witnesses for us that you put us to death wrongfully

238 So they gave them battle on the sabbath and they were slain
with their wives and their children and their cattle to the number
of a thousand persons

239 And Mathathias and his friends heard of it and they mourned for
them exceedingly

240 And every man said to his neighbour If we shall all do as our
brethren have done and not fight against the heathens for our lives
and our justifications they will now quickly root us out of the earth

241 And they determined in that day saying Whosoever shall come up
against us to fight on the sabbath day we will fight against him and
we will not all die as our brethren that were slain in the secret
places

242 Then was assembled to them the congregation of the Assideans the
stoutest of Israel every one that had a good will for the law

The Assideans  A set of men that led a religious life and were
zealous for the law and worship of God

243 And all they that fled from the evils joined themselves to them
and were a support to them

244 And they gathered an army and slew the sinners in their wrath
and the wicked men in their indignation and the rest fled to the
nations for safety

245 And Mathathias and his friends went round about and they threw
down the altars

246 And they circumcised all the children whom they found in the
confines of Israel that were uncircumcised and they did valiantly

247 And they pursued after the children of pride and the work
prospered in their hands

248 And they recovered the law out of the hands of the nations and
out of the hands of the kings and they yielded not the horn to the
sinner

They yielded not the horn etc  That is they suffered not the power
of Antiochus that man of sin to abolish the law and religion of God

249 Now the days drew near that Mathathias should die and he said to
his sons Now hath pride and chastisement gotten strength and the time
of destruction and the wrath of indignation

250 Now therefore O my sons be ye zealous for the law and give
your lives for the covenant of your fathers

251 And call to remembrance the works of the fathers which they have
done in their generations and you shall receive great glory and an
everlasting name

252 Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation and it was reputed
to him unto justice

253 Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment and he
was made lord of Egypt

254 Phinees our father by being fervent in the zeal of God
received the covenant of an everlasting priesthood

255 Jesus whilst he fulfilled the word was made ruler in Israel

Jesus  That is Josue

256 Caleb for bearing witness before the congregation received an
inheritance

257 David by his mercy obtained the throne of an everlasting
kingdom

258 Elias while he is full of zeal for the law was taken up into
heaven

259 Ananias and Azarias and Misael by believing were delivered out
of the flame

260 Daniel in his innocency was delivered out of the mouth of the
lions

261 And thus consider through all generations that none that trust
in him fail in strength

262 And fear not the words of a sinful man for his glory is dung and
worms

263 Today he is lifted up and tomorrow he shall not be found
because he is returned into his earth and his thought is come to
nothing

264 You therefore my sons take courage and behave manfully in the
law for by it you shall be glorious

265 And behold I know that your brother Simon is a man of counsel
give ear to him always and he shall be a father to you

266 And Judas Machabeus who is valiant and strong from his youth up
let him be the leader of your army and he shall manage the war of the
people

267 And you shall take to you all that observe the law and revenge
ye the wrong of your people

268 Render to the Gentiles their reward and take heed to the
precepts of the law

269 And he blessed them and was joined to his fathers

270 And he died in the hundred and fortysixth year and he was
buried by his sons in the sepulchres of his fathers in Modin and all
Israel mourned for him with great mourning



1 Machabees Chapter 3


Judas Machabeus succeeds his father and overthrows Apollonius and
Seron A great army is sent against him out of Syria He prepares his
people for battle by fasting and prayer

31 Then his son Judas called Machabeus rose up in his stead

32 And all his brethren helped him and all they that had joined
themselves to his father and they fought with cheerfulness the battle
of Israel

33 And he got his people great honour and put on a breastplate as a
giant and girt his warlike armour about him in battles and protected
the camp with his sword

34 In his acts he was like a lion and like a lions whelp roaring
for his prey

35 And he pursued the wicked and sought them out and them that
troubled his people he burnt with fire

36 And his enemies were driven away for fear of him and all the
workers of iniquity were troubled and salvation prospered in his hand

37 And he grieved many kings and made Jacob glad with his works and
his memory is blessed for ever

38 And he went through the cities of Juda and destroyed the wicked
out of them and turned away wrath from Israel

39 And he was renowned even to the utmost part of the earth and he
gathered them that were perishing

310 And Apollonius gathered together the Gentiles and a numerous and
great army from Samaria to make war against Israel

311 And Judas understood it and went forth to meet him and he
overthrew him and killed him and many fell down slain and the rest
fled away

312 And he took their spoils and Judas took the sword of Apollonius
and fought with it all his lifetime

313 And Seron captain of the army of Syria heard that Judas had
assembled a company of the faithful and a congregation with him

314 And he said I will get me a name and will be glorified in the
kingdom and will overthrow Judas and those that are with him that
have despised the edict of the king

315 And he made himself ready and the host of the wicked went up
with him strong succours to be revenged of the children of Israel

316 And they approached even as far as Bethoron and Judas went forth
to meet him with a small company

317 But when they saw the army coming to meet them they said to
Judas How shall we being few be able to fight against so great a
multitude and so strong and we are ready to faint with fasting today

318 And Judas said It is an easy matter for many to be shut up in
the hands of a few and there is no difference in the sight of the God
of heaven to deliver with a great multitude or with a small company

319 For the success of war is not in the multitude of the army but
strength cometh from heaven

320 They come against us with an insolent multitude and with pride
to destroy us and our wives and our children and to take our spoils

321 But we will fight for our lives and our laws

322 And the Lord himself will overthrow them before our face but as
for you fear them not

323 And as soon as he had made an end of speaking he rushed suddenly
upon them and Seron and his host were overthrown before him

324 And he pursued him by the descent of Bethoron even to the plain
and there fell of them eight hundred men and the rest fled into the
land of the Philistines

325 And the fear of Judas and of his brethren and the dread of
them fell upon all the nations round about them

326 And his fame came to the king and all nations told of the
battles of Judas

327 Now when king Antiochus heard these words he was angry in his
mind and he sent and gathered the forces of all his kingdom an
exceeding strong army

328 And he opened his treasury and gave out pay to the army for a
year and he commanded them that they should be ready for all things

329 And he perceived that the money of his treasures failed and that
the tributes of the country were small because of the dissension and
the evil that he had brought upon the land that he might take away the
laws of old times

330 And he feared that he should not have as formerly enough for
charges and gifts which he had given before with a liberal hand for
he had abounded more than the kings that had been before him

331 And he was greatly perplexed in mind and purposed to go into
Persia and to take tributes of the countries and to gather much
money

332 And he left Lysias a nobleman of the blood royal to oversee the
affairs of the kingdom from the river Euphrates even to the river of
Egypt

333 And to bring up his son Antiochus till he came again

334 And he delivered to him half the army and the elephants and he
gave him charge concerning all that he would have done and concerning
the inhabitants of Judea and Jerusalem

335 And that he should send an army against them to destroy and root
out the strength of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem and to take
away the memory of them from that place

336 And that he should settle strangers to dwell in all their
coasts and divide their land by lot

337 So the king took the half of the army that remained and went
forth from Antioch the chief city of his kingdom in the hundred and
fortyseventh year and he passed over the river Euphrates and went
through the higher countries

338 Then Lysias chose Ptolemee the son of Dorymenus and Nicanor
and Gorgias mighty men of the kings friends

339 And he sent with them forty thousand men and seven thousand
horsemen to go into the land of Juda and to destroy it according to
the kings orders

340 So they went forth with all their power and came and pitched
near Emmaus in the plain country

341 And the merchants of the countries heard the fame of them and
they took silver and gold in abundance and servants and they came
into the camp to buy the children of Israel for slaves and there were
joined to them the forces of Syria and of the land of the strangers

342 And Judas and his brethren saw that evils were multiplied and
that the armies approached to their borders and they knew the orders
the king had given to destroy the people and utterly abolish them

343 And they said every man to his neighbour Let us raise up the
low condition of our people and let us fight for our people and our
sanctuary

344 And the assembly was gathered that they might be ready for
battle and that they might pray and ask mercy and compassion

345 Now Jerusalem was not inhabited but was like a desert there was
none of her children that went in or out and the sanctuary was trodden
down and the children of strangers were in the castle there was the
habitation of the Gentiles and joy was taken away from Jacob and the
pipe and harp ceased there

346 And they assembled together and came to Maspha over against
Jerusalem for in Maspha was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel

347 And they fasted that day and put on haircloth and put ashes
upon their heads and they rent their garments

348 And they laid open the books of the law in which the Gentiles
searched for the likeness of their idols

349 And they brought the priestly ornaments and the first fruits and
tithes and stirred up the Nazarites that had fulfilled their days

350 And they cried with a loud voice toward heaven saying What
shall we do with these and whither shall we carry them

351 For thy holies are trodden down and are profaned and thy
priests are in mourning and are brought low

352 And behold the nations are come together against us to destroy
us thou knowest what they intend against us

353 How shall we be able to stand before their face unless thou O
God help us

364 Then they sounded with trumpets and cried out with a loud voice

366 And after this Judas appointed captains over the people over
thousands and over hundreds and over fifties and over tens

366 And he said to them that were building houses or had betrothed
wives or were planting vineyards or were fearful that they should
return every man to his house according to the law

367 So they removed the camp and pitched on the south side of
Emmaus

368 And Judas said Gird yourselves and be valiant men and be ready
against the morning that you may fight with these nations that are
assembled against us to destroy us and our sanctuary

359 For it is better for us to die in battle than to see the evils
of our nation and of the holies

360 Nevertheless as it shall be the will of God in heaven so be it
done



1 Machabees Chapter 4


Judas routs the kings army Gorgias flies before him Lysias comes
against him with a great army but is defeated Judas cleanses the
temple sets up a new altar and fortifies the sanctuary

41 Then Gorgias took five thousand men and a thousand of the best
horsemen and they removed out of the camp by night

42 That they might come upon the camp of the Jews and strike them
suddenly and the men that were of the castle were their guides

43 And Judas heard of it and rose up he and the valiant men to
attack the kings forces that were in Emmaus

44 For as yet the army was dispersed from the camp

The army was dispersed  That is in different divisions not
altogether encamped

45 And Gorgias came by night into the camp of Judas and found no
man and he sought them in the mountains for he said These men flee
from us

46 And when it was day Judas shewed himself in the plain with three
thousand men only who neither had armour nor swords

Who neither had armour nor swords  Such as they wished for

47 And they saw the camp of the Gentiles that it was strong and the
men in breastplates and the horsemen round about them and these were
trained up to war

48 And Judas said to the men that were with him Fear ye not their
multitude neither be ye afraid of their assault

49 Remember in what manner our fathers were saved in the Red Sea
when Pharaoh pursued them with a great army

410 And now let us cry to heaven and the Lord will have mercy on us
and will remember the covenant of our fathers and will destroy this
army before our face this day

411 And all nations shall know that there is one that redeemeth and
delivereth Israel

412 And the strangers lifted up their eyes and saw them coming
against them

413 And they went out of the camp to battle and they that were with
Judas sounded the trumpet

414 And they joined battle and the Gentiles were routed and fled
into the plain

415 But all the hindmost of them fell by the sword and they pursued
them as far as Gezeron and even to the plains of Idumea and of
Azotus and of Jamnia and there fell of them to the number of three
thousand men

416 And Judas returned again with his army that followed him

417 And he said to the people Be not greedy of the spoils for there
is war before us

418 And Gorgias and his army are near us in the mountain but stand
ye now against our enemies and overthrow them and you shall take the
spoils afterwards with safety

419 And as Judas was speaking these words behold part of them
appeared looking forth from the mountain

420 And Gorgias saw that his men were put to flight and that they
had set fire to the camp for the smoke that was seen declared what was
done

421 And when they had seen this they were seized with great fear
seeing at the same time Judas and his army in the plain ready to fight

422 So they all fled away into the land of the strangers

423 And Judas returned to take the spoils of the camp and they got
much gold and silver and blue silk and purple of the sea and great
riches

424 And returning home they sung a hymn and blessed God in heaven
because he is good because his mercy endureth for ever

425 So Israel had a great deliverance that day

426 And such of the strangers as escaped went and told Lysias all
that had happened

427 And when he heard these things he was amazed and discouraged
because things had not succeeded in Israel according to his mind and
as the king had commanded

428 So the year following Lysias gathered together threescore
thousand chosen men and five thousand horsemen that he might subdue
them

429 And they came into Judea and pitched their tents in Bethoron
and Judas met them with ten thousand men

430 And they saw that the army was strong and he prayed and said
Blessed art thou O Saviour of Israel who didst break the violence of
the mighty by the hand of thy servant David and didst deliver up the
camp of the strangers into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul and
of his armour bearer

431 Shut up this army in the hands of thy people Israel and let them
be confounded in their host and their horsemen

432 Strike them with fear and cause the boldness of their strength to
languish and let them quake at their own destruction

433 Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee and let all
that know thy name praise thee with hymns

434 And they joined battle and there fell of the army of Lysias five
thousand men

435 And when Lysias saw that his men were put to flight and how bold
the Jews were and that they were ready either to live or to die
manfully he went to Antioch and chose soldiers that they might come
again into Judea with greater numbers

436 Then Judas and his brethren said Behold our enemies are
discomfited let us go up now to cleanse the holy places and to repair
them

437 And all the army assembled together and they went up into Mount
Sion

438 And they saw the sanctuary desolate and the altar profaned and
the gates burnt and shrubs growing up in the courts as in a forest or
on the mountains and the chambers joining to the temple thrown down

439 And they rent their garments and made great lamentation and put
ashes on their heads

440 And they fell down to the ground on their faces and they sounded
with the trumpets of alarm and they cried towards heaven

441 Then Judas appointed men to fight against them that were in the
castle till they had cleansed the holy places

442 And he chose priests without blemish whose will was set upon the
law of God

443 And they cleansed the holy places and took away the stones that
had been defiled into an unclean place

444 And he considered about the altar of holocausts that had been
profaned what he should do with it

445 And a good counsel came into their minds to pull it down lest
it should be a reproach to them because the Gentiles had defiled it
so they threw it down

446 And they laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a
convenient place till there should come a prophet and give answer
concerning them

447 Then they took whole stones according to the law and built a new
altar according to the former

448 And they built up the holy places and the things that were
within the temple and they sanctified the temple and the courts

449 And they made new holy vessels and brought in the candlestick
and the altar of incense and the table into the temple

450 And they put incense upon the altar and lighted up the lamps
that were upon the candlestick and they gave light in the temple

451 And they set the loaves upon the table and hung up the veils
and finished all the works that they had begun to make

452 And they arose before the morning on the five and twentieth day
of the ninth month which is the month of Casleu in the hundred and
fortyeighth year

453 And they offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new
altar of holocausts which they had made

454 According to the time and according to the day wherein the
heathens had defiled it in the same was it dedicated anew with
canticles and harps and lutes and cymbals

455 And all the people fell upon their faces and adored and blessed
up to heaven him that had prospered them

456 And they kept the dedication of the altar eight days and they
offered holocausts with joy and sacrifices of salvation and of
praise

457 And they adorned the front of the temple with crowns of gold and
escutcheons and they renewed the gates and the chambers and hanged
doors upon them

458 And there was exceeding great joy among the people and the
reproach of the Gentiles was turned away

459 And Judas and his brethren and all the church of Israel
decreed that the day of the dedication of the altar should be kept in
its season from year to year for eight days from the five and
twentieth day of the month of Casleu with joy and gladness

460 They built up also at that time Mount Sion with high walls and
strong towers round about lest the Gentiles should at any time come
and tread it down as they did before

461 And he placed a garrison there to keep it and he fortified it
to secure Bethsura that the people might have a defence against
Idumea



1 Machabees Chapter 5


Judas and his brethren attack the enemies of their country and deliver
them that were distressed Josephus and Azarius attempting contrary to
order to fight against their enemies are defeated

51 Now it came to pass when the nations round about heard that the
altar and the sanctuary were built up as before that they were
exceeding angry

52 And they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that were
among them and they began to kill some of the people and to persecute
them

53 Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea and them
that were in Acrabathane because they beset the Israelites round
about and he made a great slaughter of them

54 And he remembered the malice of the children of Bean who were a
snare and a stumblingblock to the people by lying in wait for them in
the way

55 And they were shut up by him in towers and he set upon them and
devoted them to utter destruction and burnt their towers with fire
and all that were in them

56 Then he passed over to the children of Ammon where he found a
mighty power and much people and Timotheus was their captain

57 And he fought many battles with them and they were discomfited in
their sight and he smote them

58 And he took the city of Gazer and her towns and returned into
Judea

59 And the Gentiles that were in Galaad assembled themselves
together against the Israelites that were in their quarters to destroy
them and they fled into the fortress of Datheman

510 And they sent letters to Judas and his brethren saying The
heathens that are round about are gathered together against us to
destroy us

511 And they are preparing to come and to take the fortress into
which we are fled and Timotheus is the captain of their host

512 Now therefore come and deliver us out of their hands for many
of us are slain

513 And all our brethren that were in the places of Tubin are
killed and they have carried away their wives and their children
captives and taken their spoils and they have slain there almost a
thousand men

514 And while they were yet reading these letters behold there came
other messengers out of Galilee with their garments rent who related
according to these words

515 Saying that they of Ptolemais and of Tyre and of Sidon were
assembled against them and all Galilee is filled with strangers in
order to consume us

516 Now when Judas and the people heard these words a great assembly
met together to consider what they should do for their brethren that
were in trouble and were assaulted by them

517 And Judas said to Simon his brother Choose thee men and go
and deliver thy brethren in Galilee and I and my brother Jonathan
will go into the country of Galaad

518 And he left Joseph the son of Zacharias and Azarias captains
of the people with the remnant of the army in Judea to keep it

519 And he commanded them saying Take ye the charge of this people
but make no war against the heathens till we return

520 Now three thousand men were allotted to Simon to go into
Galilee and eight thousand to Judas to go into the land of Galaad

521 And Simon went into Galilee and fought many battles with the
heathens and the heathens were discomfited before his face and he
pursued them even to the gate of Ptolemais

522 And there fell of the heathens almost three thousand men and he
took the spoils of them

523 And he took with him those that were in Galilee and in Arbatis
with their wives and children and all that they had and he brought
them into Judea with great joy

524 And Judas Machabeus and Jonathan his brother passed over the
Jordan and went three days journey through the desert

525 And the Nabutheans met them and received them in a peaceable
manner and told them all that happened to their brethren in the land
of Galaad

526 And that many of them were shut up in Barasa and in Bosor and
in Alima and in Casphor and in Mageth and in Carnaim all these
strong and great cities

527 Yea and that they were kept shut up in the rest of the cities of
Galaad and that they had appointed to bring their army on the morrow
near to these cities and to take them and to destroy them all in one
day

528 Then Judas and his army suddenly turned their march into the
desert to Bosor and took the city and he slew every male by the edge
of the sword and took all their spoils and burnt it with fire

529 And they removed from thence by night and went till they came to
the fortress

530 And it came to pass that early in the morning when they lifted
up their eyes behold there were people without number carrying
ladders and engines to take the fortress and assault them

531 And Judas saw that the fight was begun and the cry of the battle
went up to heaven like a trumpet and a great cry out of the city

532 And he said to his host Fight ye today for your brethren

533 And he came with three companies behind them and they sounded
their trumpets and cried out in prayer

534 And the host of Timotheus understood that it was Machabeus and
they fled away before his face and they made a great slaughter of them
and there fell of them in that day almost eight thousand men

535 And Judas turned aside to Maspha and assaulted and took it and
he slew every male thereof and took the spoils thereof and burnt it
with fire

536 From thence he marched and took Casbon and Mageth and Bosor
and the rest of the cities of Galaad

537 But after this Timotheus gathered another army and camped over
against Raphon beyond the torrent

538 And Judas sent men to view the army and they brought him word
saying All the nations that are round about us are assembled unto
him an army exceeding great

539 And they have hired the Arabians to help them and they have
pitched their tents beyond the torrent ready to come to fight against
thee And Judas went to meet them

540 And Timotheus said to the captains of his army When Judas and
his army come near the torrent of water if he pass over unto us first
we shall not be able to withstand him for he will certainly prevail
over us

541 But if he be afraid to pass over and camp on the other side of
the river we will pass over to them and shall prevail against him

542 Now when Judas came near the torrent of water he set the scribes
of the people by the torrent and commanded them saying Suffer no man
to stay behind but let all come to the battle

543 And he passed over to them first and all the people after him
and all the heathens were discomfited before them and they threw away
their weapons and fled to the temple that was in Carnaim

544 And he took that city and the temple he burnt with fire with
all things that were therein and Carnaim was subdued and could not
stand against the face of Judas

545 And Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the
land of Galaad from the least even to the greatest and their wives
and children and an army exceeding great to come into the land of
Juda

546 And they came as far as Ephron now this was a great city
situate in the way strongly fortified and there was no means to turn
from it on the right hand or on the left but the way was through the
midst of it

547 And they that were in the city shut themselves in and stopped up
the gates with stones and Judas sent to them with peaceable words

548 Saying Let us pass through your land to go into our own
country and no man shall hurt you we will only pass through on foot
But they would not open to them

549 Then Judas commanded proclamation to be made in the camp that
they should make an assault every man in the place where he was

550 And the men of the army drew near and he assaulted that city all
the day and all the night and the city was delivered into his hands

551 And they slew every male with the edge of the sword and he razed
the city and took the spoils thereof and passed through all the city
over them that were slain

552 Then they passed over the Jordan to the great plain that is over
against Bethsan

553 And Judas gathered together the hindmost and he exhorted the
people all the way through till they came into the land of Juda

554 And they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness and offered
holocausts because not one of them was slain till they had returned
in peace

555 Now in the days that Judas and Jonathan were in the land of
Galaad and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais

556 Joseph the son of Zacharias and Azarias captain of the
soldiers heard of the good success and the battles that were fought

557 And he said Let us also get us a name and let us go fight
against the Gentiles that are round about us

558 And he gave charge to them that were in his army and they went
towards Jamnia

559 And Gorgias and his men went out of the city to give them
battle

560 And Joseph and Azarias were put to flight and were pursued unto
the borders of Judea and there fell on that day of the people of
Israel about two thousand men and there was a great overthrow of the
people

561 Because they did not hearken to Judas and his brethren thinking
that they should do manfully

562 But they were not of the seed of those men by whom salvation was
brought to Israel

563 And the men of Juda were magnified exceedingly in the sight of
all Israel and of all the nations where their name was heard

564 And the people assembled to them with joyful acclamations

565 Then Judas and his brethren went forth and attacked the children
of Esau in the land towards the south and he took Chebron and her
towns and he burnt the walls thereof and the towers all round it

566 And he removed his camp to go into the land of the aliens and he
went through Samaria

567 In that day some priests fell in battle while desiring to do
manfully they went out unadvisedly to fight

568 And Judas turned to Azotus into the land of the strangers and
he threw down their altars and he burnt the statues of their gods with
fire and he took the spoils of the cities and returned into the land
of Juda



1 Machabees Chapter 6


The fruitless repentance and death of Antiochus His son comes against
Judas with a formidable army He besieges Sion but at last makes peace
with the Jews

61 Now king Antiochus was going through the higher countries and he
heard that the city of Elymais in Persia was greatly renowned and
abounding in silver and gold

62 And that there was in it a temple exceeding rich and coverings of
gold and breastplates and shields which king Alexander son of
Philip the Macedonian that reigned first in Greece had left there

63 So he came and sought to take the city and to pillage it but he
was not able because the design was known to them that were in the
city

64 And they rose up against him in battle and he fled away from
thence and departed with great sadness and returned towards
Babylonia

65 And whilst he was in Persia there came one that told him how the
armies that were in the land of Juda were put to flight

66 And that Lysias went with a very great power and was put to
flight before the face of the Jews and that they were grown strong by
the armour and power and store of spoils which they had gotten out of
the camps which they had destroyed

67 And that they had thrown down the abomination which he had set up
upon the altar in Jerusalem and that they had compassed about the
sanctuary with high walls as before and Bethsura also his city

68 And it came to pass when the king heard these words that he was
struck with fear and exceedingly moved and he laid himself down upon
his bed and fell sick for grief because it had not fallen out to him
as he imagined

69 And he remained there many days for great grief came more and
more upon him and he made account that he should die

610 And he called for all his friends and said to them Sleep is
gone from my eyes and I am fallen away and my heart is cast down for
anxiety

611 And I said in my heart Into how much tribulation am I come and
into what floods of sorrow wherein now I am I that was pleasant and
beloved in my power

612 But now I remember the evils that I did in Jerusalem from whence
also I took away all the spoils of gold and of silver that were in
it and I sent to destroy the inhabitants of Juda without cause

613 I know therefore that for this cause these evils have found me
and behold I perish with great grief in a strange land

614 Then he called Philip one of his friends and he made him regent
over all his kingdom

615 And he gave him the crown and his robe and his ring that he
should go to Antiochus his son and should bring him up for the
kingdom

616 So king Antiochus died there in the year one hundred and
fortynine

617 And Lysias understood that the king was dead and he set up
Antiochus his son to reign whom he had brought up young and he
called his name Eupator

618 Now they that were in the castle had shut up the Israelites
round about the holy places and they were continually seeking their
hurt and to strengthen the Gentiles

619 And Judas purposed to destroy them and he called together all
the people to besiege them

620 And they came together and besieged them in the year one hundred
and fifty and they made battering slings and engines

621 And some of the besieged got out and some wicked men of Israel
joined themselves unto them

622 And they went to the king and said How long dost thou delay to
execute judgment and to revenge our brethren

623 We determined to serve thy father and to do according to his
orders and obey his edicts

624 And for this they of our nation are alienated from us and have
slain as many of us as they could find and have spoiled our
inheritances

625 Neither have they put forth their hand against us only but also
against all our borders

626 And behold they have approached this day to the castle of
Jerusalem to take it and they have fortified the strong hold of
Bethsura

627 And unless thou speedily prevent them they will do greater
things than these and thou shalt not be able to subdue them

628 Now when the king heard this he was angry and he called
together all his friends and the captains of his army and them that
were over the horsemen

629 There came also to him from other realms and from the islands of
the sea hired troops

630 And the number of his army was an hundred thousand footmen and
twenty thousand horsemen and thirtytwo elephants trained to battle

631 And they went through Idumea and approached to Bethsura and
fought many days and they made engines but they sallied forth and
burnt them with fire and fought manfully

But they sallied forth  That is the citizens of Bethsura sallied
forth and burnt them that is burnt the engines of the besiegers

632 And Judas departed from the castle and removed the camp to
Bethzacharam over against the kings camp

633 And the king rose before it was light and made his troops march
on fiercely towards the way of Bethzacharam and the armies made
themselves ready for the battle and they sounded the trumpets

634 And they shewed the elephants the blood of grapes and
mulberries to provoke them to fight

635 And they distributed the beasts by the legions and there stood
by every elephant a thousand men in coats of mail and with helmets of
brass on their heads and five hundred horsemen set in order were
chosen for every beast

636 These before the time wheresoever the beast was they were there
and whithersoever it went they went and they departed not from it

These before the time  That is these were ready for every occasion

637 And upon the beast there were strong wooden towers which covered
every one of them and engines upon them and upon every one thirtytwo
valiant men who fought from above and an Indian to rule the beast

638 And the rest of the horsemen he placed on this side and on that
side at the two wings with trumpets to stir up the army and to
hasten them forward that stood thick together in the legions thereof

639 Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and of brass
the mountains glittered therewith and they shone like lamps of fire

640 And part of the kings army was distinguished by the high
mountains and the other part by the low places and they marched on
warily and orderly

641 And all the inhabitants of the land were moved at the noise of
their multitude and the marching of the company and the rattling of
the armour for the army was exceeding great and strong

642 And Judas and his army drew near for battle and there fell of
the kings army six hundred men

643 And Eleazar the son of Saura saw one of the beasts harnessed
with the kings harness and it was higher than the other beasts and
it seemed to him that the king was on it

644 And he exposed himself to deliver his people and to get himself
an everlasting name

645 And he ran up to it boldly in the midst of the legion killing on
the right hand and on the left and they fell by him on this side and
that side

646 And he went between the feet of the elephant and put himself
under it and slew it and it fell to the ground upon him and he died
there

647 Then they seeing the strength of the king and the fierceness of
his army turned away from them

648 But the kings army went up against them to Jerusalem and the
kings army pitched their tents against Judea and Mount Sion

649 And he made peace with them that were in Bethsura and they came
forth out of the city because they had no victuals being shut up
there for it was the year of rest to the land

650 And the king took Bethsura and he placed there a garrison to
keep it

651 And he turned his army against the sanctuary for many days and
he set up there battering slings and engines and instruments to cast
fire and engines to cast stones and javelins and pieces to shoot
arrows and slings

652 And they also made engines against their engines and they fought
for many days

653 But there were no victuals in the city because it was the
seventh year and such as had stayed in Judea of them that came from
among the nations had eaten the residue of all that which had been
stored up

654 And there remained in the holy places but a few for the famine
had prevailed over them and they were dispersed every man to his own
place

655 Now Lysias heard that Philip whom king Antiochus while he lived
had appointed to bring up his son Antiochus and to reign

656 Was returned from Persia and Media with the army that went with
him and that he sought to take upon him the affairs of the kingdom

657 Wherefore he made haste to go and say to the king and to the
captains of the army We decay daily and our provision of victuals is
small and the place that we lay siege to is strong and it lieth upon
us to take order for the affairs of the kingdom

658 Now therefore let us come to an agreement with these men and
make peace with them and with all their nation

659 And let us covenant with them that they may live according to
their own laws as before For because of our despising their laws
they have been provoked and have done all these things

660 And the proposal was acceptable in the sight of the king and of
the princes and he sent to them to make peace and they accepted of
it

661 And the king and the princes swore to them and they came out of
the strong hold

662 Then the king entered into Mount Sion and saw the strength of
the place and he quickly broke the oath that he had taken and gave
commandment to throw down the wall round about

663 And he departed in haste and returned to Antioch where he found
Philip master of the city and he fought against him and took the
city



1 Machabees Chapter 7


Demetrius is made king and sends Bacchides and Alcimus the priest into
Judea and after them Nicanor who is slain by Judas with all his army

71 In the hundred and fiftyfirst year Demetrius the son of
Seleucus departed from the city of Rome and came up with few men into
a city of the sea coast and reigned there

72 And it came to pass as he entered into the house of the kingdom of
his fathers that the army seized upon Antiochus and Lysias to bring
them unto him

73 And when he knew it he said Let me not see their face

74 So the army slew them And Demetrius sat upon the throne of his
kingdom

75 And there came to him the wicked and ungodly men of Israel and
Alcimus was at the head of them who desired to be made high priest

76 And they accused the people to the king saying Judas and his
brethren have destroyed all thy friends and he hath driven us out of
our land

77 Now therefore send some men whom thou trustest and let him go
and see all the havoc he hath made amongst us and in the kings lands
and let him punish all his friends and their helpers

78 Then the king chose Bacchides one of his friends that ruled
beyond the great river in the kingdom and was faithful to the king
and he sent him

79 To see the havoc that Judas had made and the wicked Alcimus he
made high priest and commanded him to take revenge upon the children
of Israel

710 And they arose and came with a great army into the land of Juda
and they sent messengers and spoke to Judas and his brethren with
peaceable words deceitfully

711 But they gave no heed to their words for they saw that they were
come with a great army

712 Then there assembled to Alcimus and Bacchides a company of the
scribes to require things that are just

713 And first the Assideans that were among the children of Israel
and they sought peace of them

714 For they said One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come
he will not deceive us

715 And he spoke to them peaceably and he swore to them saying We
will do you no harm nor your friends

716 And they believed him And he took threescore of them and slew
them in one day according to the word that is written

717 The flesh of thy saints and the blood of them they have shed round
about Jerusalem and there was none to bury them

718 Then fear and trembling fell upon all the people for they said
There is no truth nor justice among them for they have broken the
covenant and the oath which they made

719 And Bacchides removed the camp from Jerusalem and pitched in
Bethzecha and he sent and took many of them that were fled away from
him and some of the people he killed and threw them into a great pit

720 Then he committed the country to Alcimus and left with him
troops to help him So Bacchides went away to the king

721 But Alcimus did what he could to maintain his chief priesthood

722 And they that disturbed the people resorted to him and they got
the land of Juda into their power and did much hurt in Israel

723 And Judas saw all the evils that Alcimus and they that were with
him did to the children of Israel much more than the Gentiles

724 And he went out into all the coasts of Judea round about and
took vengeance upon the men that had revolted and they ceased to go
forth any more into the country

725 And Alcimus saw that Judas and they that were with him
prevailed and he knew that he could not stand against them and he
went back to the king and accused them of many crimes

726 And the king sent Nicanor one of his principal lords who was a
great enemy to Israel and he commanded him to destroy the people

727 And Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great army and he sent to
Judas and to his brethren deceitfully with friendly words

728 Saying Let there be no fighting between me and you I will come
with a few men to see your faces with peace

729 And he came to Judas and they saluted one another peaceably and
the enemies were prepared to take away Judas by force

730 And the thing was known to Judas that he was come to him with
deceit and he was much afraid of him and would not see his face any
more

731 And Nicanor knew that his counsel was discovered and he went out
to fight against Judas near Capharsalama

732 And there fell of Nicanors army almost five thousand men and
they fled into the city of David

733 And after this Nicanor went up into mount Sion and some of the
priests and the people came out to salute him peaceably and to shew
him the holocausts that were offered for the king

734 But he mocked and despised them and abused them and he spoke
proudly

735 And swore in anger saying Unless Judas and his army be
delivered into my hands as soon as ever I return in peace I will burn
this house And he went out in a great rage

736 And the priests went in and stood before the face of the altar
and the temple and weeping they said

737 Thou O Lord hast chosen this house for thy name to be called
upon therein that it might be a house of prayer and supplication for
thy people

738 Be avenged of this man and his army and let them fall by the
sword remember their blasphemies and suffer them not to continue any
longer

739 Then Nicanor went out from Jerusalem and encamped near to
Bethoron and an army of Syria joined him

740 But Judas pitched in Adarsa with three thousand men and Judas
prayed and said

741 O Lord when they that were sent by king Sennacherib blasphemed
thee an angel went out and slew of them a hundred and eightyfive
thousand

742 Even so destroy this army in our sight today and let the rest
know that he hath spoken ill against thy sanctuary and judge thou him
according to his wickedness

743 And the armies joined battle on the thirteenth day of the month
Adar and the army of Nicanor was defeated and he himself was first
slain in the battle

744 And when his army saw that Nicanor was slain they threw away
their weapons and fled

745 And they pursued after them one days journey from Adazer even
till ye come to Gazara and they sounded the trumpets after them with
signals

746 And they went forth out of all the towns of Judea round about
and they pushed them with the horns and they turned again to them and
they were all slain with the sword and there was not left of them so
much as one

747 And they took the spoils of them for a booty and they cut off
Nicanors head and his right hand which he had proudly stretched out
and they brought it and hung it up over against Jerusalem

748 And the people rejoiced exceedingly and they spent that day with
great joy

749 And he ordained that this day should be kept every year being
the thirteenth of the month of Adar

750 And the land of Juda was quiet for a short time



1 Machabees Chapter 8


Judas hears of the great character of the Romans he makes a league
with them

81 Now Judas heard of the fame of the Romans that they are powerful
and strong and willingly agree to all things that are requested of
them and that whosoever have come to them they have made amity with
them and that they are mighty in power

82 And they heard of their battles and their noble acts which they
had done in Galatia how they had conquered them and brought them
under tribute

They heard etc  What is here set down of the history and character
of the ancient Romans is not an assertion or affirmation of the
sacred writer but only a relation of what Judas had heard of them

83 And how great things they had done in the land of Spain and that
they had brought under their power the mines of silver and of gold that
are there and had gotten possession of all the place by their counsel
and patience

84 And had conquered places that were very far off from them and
kings that came against them from the ends of the earth and had
overthrown them with great slaughter and the rest pay them tribute
every year

85 And that they had defeated in battle Philip and Perses the king of
the Ceteans and the rest that had borne arms against them and had
conquered them

Ceteans  That is the Macedonians

86 And how Antiochus the great king of Asia who went to fight
against them having a hundred and twenty elephants with horsemen and
chariots and a very great army was routed by them

87 And how they took him alive and appointed to him that both he
and they that should reign after him should pay a great tribute and
that he should give hostages and that which was agreed upon

88 And the country of the Indians and of the Medes and of the
Lydians some of their best provinces and those which they had taken
from them they gave to king Eumenes

Eumenes  King of Pergamus

89 And that they who were in Greece had a mind to go and to destroy
them and they had knowledge thereof

810 And they sent a general against them and fought with them and
many of them were slain and they carried away their wives and their
children captives and spoiled them and took possession of their land
and threw down their walls and brought them to be their servants unto
this day

811 And the other kingdoms and islands that at any time had
resisted them they had destroyed and brought under their power

812 But with their friends and such as relied upon them they kept
amity and had conquered kingdoms that were near and that were far
off for all that heard their name were afraid of them

813 That whom they had a mind to help to a kingdom those reigned
and whom they would they deposed from the kingdom and they were
greatly exalted

814 And none of all these wore a crown or was clothed in purple to
be magnified thereby

815 And that they had made themselves a senate house and consulted
daily three hundred and twenty men that sat in counsel always for the
people that they might do the things that were right

816 And that they committed their government to one man every year
to rule over all their country and they all obey one and there is no
envy nor jealousy amongst them

To one man  There were two consuls but one only ruled at one time
each in his dayIbid No envy etc  So Judas had heard and it was
so far true with regard to the ancient Romans that as yet no envy or
jealousy had divided them into such open factions and civil wars as
they afterwards experienced in the time of Marius and Sylla etc

817 So Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John the son of Jacob and
Jason the son of Eleazar and he sent them to Rome to make a league of
amity and confederacy with them

818 And that they might take off from them the yoke of the Grecians
for they saw that they oppressed the kingdom of Israel with servitude

819 And they went to Rome a very long journey and they entered into
the senate house and said

820 Judas Machabeus and his brethren and the people of the Jews
have sent us to you to make alliance and peace with you and that we
may be registered your confederates and friends

821 And the proposal was pleasing in their sight

822 And this is the copy of the writing that they wrote back again
graven in tables of brass and sent to Jerusalem that it might be with
them there for a memorial of the peace and alliance

823 GOOD SUCCESS BE TO THE ROMANS and to the people of the Jews by
sea and by land for ever and far be the sword and enemy from them

824 But if there come first any war upon the Romans or any of their
confederates in all their dominions

825 The nation of the Jews shall help them according as the time
shall direct with all their heart

826 Neither shall they give them whilst they are fighting or
furnish them with wheat or arms or money or ships as it hath seemed
good to the Romans and they shall obey their orders without taking
any thing of them

827 In like manner also if war shall come first upon the nation of
the Jews the Romans shall help them with all their heart according as
the time shall permit them

828 And there shall not be given to them that come to their aid
either wheat or arms or money or ships as it hath seemed good to
the Romans and they shall observe their orders without deceit

829 According to these articles did the Romans covenant with the
people of the Jews

830 And if after this one party or the other shall have a mind to
add to these articles or take away any thing they may do it at their
pleasure and whatsoever they shall add or take away shall be
ratified

831 Moreover concerning the evils that Demetrius the king hath
done against them we have written to him saying Why hast thou made
thy yoke heavy upon our friends and allies the Jews

832 If therefore they come again to us complaining of thee we will
do them justice and will make war against thee by sea and land



1 Machabees Chapter 9


Bacchides is sent again into Judea Judas fights against him with eight
hundred men and is slain Jonathan succeeds him and revenges the murder
of his brother John He fights against Bacchides Alcimus dies
miserably Bacchides besieges Bethbessen He is forced to raise the
siege and leave the country

91 In the mean time when Demetrius heard that Nicanor and his army
were fallen in battle he sent again Bacchides and Alcimus into Judea
and the right wing of his army with them

92 And they took the road that leadeth to Galgal and they camped in
Masaloth which is in Arabella and they made themselves masters of it
and slew many people

93 In the first month of the hundred and fiftysecond year they
brought the army to Jerusalem

94 And they arose and went to Berea with twenty thousand men and
two thousand horsemen

95 Now Judas had pitched his tents in Laisa and three thousand
chosen men with him

96 And they saw the multitude of the army that they were many and
they were seized with great fear and many withdrew themselves out of
the camp and there remained of them no more than eight hundred men

97 And Judas saw that his army slipped away and the battle pressed
upon him and his heart was cast down because he had not time to
gather them together and he was discouraged

98 Then he said to them that remained Let us arise and go against
our enemies if we may be able to fight against them

99 But they dissuaded him saying We shall not be able but let us
save our lives now and return to our brethren and then we will fight
against them for we are but few

910 Then Judas said God forbid we should do this thing and flee
away from them but if our time be come let us die manfully for our
brethren and let us not stain our glory

911 And the army removed out of the camp and they stood over against
them and the horsemen were divided into two troops and the slingers
and the archers went before the army and they that were in the front
were all men of valour

912 And Bacchides was in the right wing and the legion drew near on
two sides and they sounded the trumpets

913 And they also that were on Judass side even they also cried
out and the earth shook at the noise of the armies and the battle was
fought from morning even unto the evening

914 And Judas perceived that the stronger part of the army of
Bacchides was on the right side and all the stout of heart came
together with him

915 And the right wing was discomfited by them and he pursued them
even to the mount Azotus

916 And they that were in the left wing saw that the right wing was
discomfited and they followed after Judas and them that were with
him at their back

917 And the battle was hard fought and there fell many wounded of
the one side and of the other

918 And Judas was slain and the rest fled away

919 And Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother and buried him
in the sepulchre of their fathers in the city of Modin

920 And all the people of Israel bewailed him with great lamentation
and they mourned for him many days

921 And said How is the mighty man fallen that saved the people of
Israel

922 But the rest of the words of the wars of Judas and of the noble
acts that he did and of his greatness are not written for they were
very many

923 And it came to pass after the death of Judas that the wicked
began to put forth their heads in all the confines of Israel and all
the workers of iniquity rose up

924 In those days there was a very great famine and they and all
their country yielded to Bacchides

925 And Bacchides chose the wicked men and made them lords of the
country

926 And they sought out and made diligent search after the friends
of Judas and brought them to Bacchides and he took vengeance of them
and abused them

927 And there was a great tribulation in Israel such as was not
since the day that there was no prophet seen in Israel

928 And all the friends of Judas came together and said to Jonathan

929 Since thy brother Judas died there is not a man like him to go
forth against our enemies Bacchides and them that are the enemies of
our nation

930 Now therefore we have chosen thee this day to be our prince
and captain in his stead to fight our battles

931 So Jonathan took upon him the government at that time and rose
up in the place of Judas his brother

932 And Bacchides had knowledge of it and sought to kill him

933 And Jonathan and Simon his brother knew it and all that were
with them and they fled into the desert of Thecua and they pitched by
the water of the lake Asphar

934 And Bacchides understood it and he came himself with all his
army over the Jordan on the sabbath day

935 And Jonathan sent his brother a captain of the people to desire
the Nabutheans his friends that they would lend them their equipage
which was copious

936 And the children of Jambri came forth out of Madaba and took
John and all that he had and went away with them

937 After this it was told Jonathan and Simon his brother that the
children of Jambri made a great marriage and were bringing the bride
out of Madaba the daughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan
with great pomp

938 And they remembered the blood of John their brother and they
went up and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain

939 And they lifted up their eyes and saw and behold a tumult and
great preparation and the bridegroom came forth and his friends and
his brethren to meet them with timbrels and musical instruments and
many weapons

940 And they rose up against them from the place where they lay in
ambush and slew them and there fell many wounded and the rest fled
into the mountains and they took all their spoils

941 And the marriage was turned into mourning and the noise of their
musical instruments into lamentation

942 And they took revenge for the blood of their brother and they
returned to the bank of the Jordan

943 And Bacchides heard it and he came on the sabbath day even to
the bank of the Jordan with a great power

944 And Jonathan said to his company Let us arise and fight against
our enemies for it is not now as yesterday and the day before

945 For behold the battle is before us and the water of the Jordan
on this side and on that side and banks and marshes and woods and
there is no place for us to turn aside

946 Now therefore cry ye to heaven that ye may be delivered from
the hand of your enemies And they joined battle

947 And Jonathan stretched forth his hand to strike Bacchides but he
turned away from him backwards

948 And Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into the Jordan
and swam over the Jordan to them

949 And there fell of Bacchides side that day a thousand men and
they returned to Jerusalem

950 And they built strong cities in Judea the fortress that was in
Jericho and in Ammaus and in Bethoron and in Bethel and Thamnata
and Phara and Thopo with high walls and gates and bars

951 And he placed garrisons in them that they might wage war against
Israel

952 And he fortified the city of Bethsura and Gazara and the
castle and set garrisons in them and provisions of victuals

953 And he took the sons of the chief men of the country for
hostages and put them in the castle in Jerusalem in custody

954 Now in the year one hundred and fiftythree the second month
Alcimus commanded the walls of the inner court of the sanctuary to be
thrown down and the works of the prophets to be destroyed and he
began to destroy

955 At that time Alcimus was struck and his works were hindered and
his mouth was stopped and he was taken with a palsy so that he could no
more speak a word nor give order concerning his house

956 And Alcimus died at that time in great torment

957 And Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead and he returned to the
king and the land was quiet for two years

958 And all the wicked held a council saying Behold Jonathan and
they that are with him dwell at ease and without fear now therefore
let us bring Bacchides hither and he shall take them all in one night

959 So they went and gave him counsel

960 And he arose to come with a great army and he sent secretly
letters to his adherents that were in Judea to seize upon Jonathan and
them that were with him but they could not for their design was known
to them

961 And he apprehended of the men of the country that were the
principal authors of the mischief fifty men and he slew them

962 And Jonathan and Simon and they that were with him retired
into Bethbessen which is in the desert and he repaired the breaches
thereof and they fortified it

963 And when Bacchides knew it he gathered together all his
multitude and sent word to them that were of Judea

964 And he came and camped above Bethbessen and fought against it
many days and made engines

965 But Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city and went forth
into the country and came with a number of men

966 And struck Odares and his brethren and the children of
Phaseron in their tents and he began to slay and to increase in
forces

967 But Simon and they that were with him sallied out of the city
and burnt the engines

968 And they fought against Bacchides and he was discomfited by
them and they afflicted him exceedingly for his counsel and his
enterprise was in vain

969 And he was angry with the wicked men that had given him counsel
to come into their country and he slew many of them and he purposed
to return with the rest into their country

970 And Jonathan had knowledge of it and he sent ambassadors to him
to make peace with him and to restore to him the prisoners

971 And he accepted it willingly and did according to his words and
swore that he would do him no harm all the days of his life

972 And he restored to him the prisoners which he before had taken
out of the land of Juda and he returned and went away into his own
country and he came no more into their borders

973 So the sword ceased from Israel and Jonathan dwelt in Machmas
and Jonathan began there to judge the people and he destroyed the
wicked out of Israel



1 Machabees Chapter 10


Alexander Bales sets himself up for king both he and Demetrius seek to
make Jonathan their friend Alexander kills Demetrius in battle and
honours Jonathan His victory over Apollonius

101 Now in the hundred and sixtieth year Alexander the son of
Antiochus surnamed the Illustrious came up and took Ptolemais and
they received him and he reigned there

102 And king Demetrius heard of it and gathered together an
exceeding great army and went forth against him to fight

103 And Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan with peaceable words to
magnify him

104 For he said Let us first make a peace with him before he make
one with Alexander against us

105 For he will remember all the evils that we have done against him
and against his brother and against his nation

106 And he gave him authority to gather together a army and to make
arms and that he should be his confederate and the hostages that were
in the castle he commanded to be delivered to him

107 And Jonathan came to Jerusalem and read the letters in the
hearing of all the people and of them that were in the castle

108 And they were struck with great fear because they heard that the
king had given him authority to gather together an army

109 And the hostages were delivered to Jonathan and he restored them
to their parents

1010 And Jonathan dwelt in Jerusalem and began to build and to
repair the city

1011 And he ordered workmen to build the walls and mount Sion round
about with square stones for fortification and so they did

1012 Then the strangers that were in the strong holds which
Bacchides had built fled away

1013 And every man left his place and departed into his own country

1014 Only in Bethsura there remained some of them that had forsaken
the law and the commandments of God for this was a place of refuge
for them

1015 And king Alexander heard of the promises that Demetrius had made
Jonathan and they told him of the battles and the worthy acts that he
and his brethren had done and the labours that they had endured

1016 And he said Shall we find such another man now therefore we
will make him our friend and our confederate

1017 So he wrote a letter and sent it to him according to these
words saying

1018 King Alexander to his brother Jonathan greetings

1019 We have heard of thee that thou art a man of great power and
fit to be our friend

1020 Now therefore we make thee this day high priest of thy nation
and that thou be called the kings friend and he sent him a purple
robe and a crown of gold and that thou be of one mind with us in our
affairs and keep friendship with us

1021 Then Jonathan put on the holy vestment in the seventh month in
the year one hundred and threescore at the feast day of the
tabernacles and he gathered together an army and made a great number
of arms

1022 And Demetrius heard these words and was exceeding sorry and
said

1023 What is this that we have done that Alexander hath prevented us
to gain the friendship of the Jews to strengthen himself

1024 I also will write to them words of request and offer dignities
and gifts that they may be with me to aid me

1025 And he wrote to them in these words King Demetrius to the
nation of the Jews greeting

1026 Whereas you have kept covenant with us and have continued in
our friendship and have not joined with our enemies we have heard of
it and are glad

1027 Wherefore now continue still to keep fidelity towards us and we
will reward you with good things for what you have done in our behalf

1028 And we will remit to you many charges and will give you gifts

1029 And now I free you and all the Jews from tributes and I
release you from the customs of salt and remit the crowns and the
thirds of the seed

1030 And the half of the fruit of trees which is my share I leave
to you from this day forward so that it shall not be taken of the land
of Juda and of the three cities that are added thereto out of Samaria
and Galilee from this day forth and for ever

1031 And let Jerusalem be holy and free with the borders thereof
and let the tenths and tributes be for itself

1032 I yield up also the power of the castle that is in Jerusalem
and I give it to the high priest to place therein such men as he shall
choose to keep it

1033 And every soul of the Jews that hath been carried captive from
the land of Juda in all my kingdom I set at liberty freely that all
be discharged from tributes even of their cattle

1034 And I will that all the feasts and the sabbaths and the new
moons and the days appointed and three days before the solemn day
and three days after the solemn day be all days of immunity and
freedom for all the Jews that are in my kingdom

1035 And no man shall have power to do any thing against them or to
molest any of them in any cause

1036 And let there be enrolled in the kings army to the number of
thirty thousand of the Jews and allowance shall be made them as is
due to all the kings forces and certain of them shall be appointed to
be in the fortresses of the great king

1037 And some of them shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom
that are of trust and let the governors be taken from among
themselves and let them walk in their own laws as the king hath
commanded in the land of Juda

1038 And the three cities that are added to Judea out of the country
of Samaria let them be accounted with Judea that they may be under
one and obey no other authority but that of the high priest

1039 Ptolemais and the confines thereof I give as a free gift to the
holy places that are in Jerusalem for the necessary charges of the
holy things

1040 And I give every year fifteen thousand sickles of silver out of
the kings accounts of what belongs to me

1041 And all that is above which they that were over the affairs the
years before had not paid from this time they shall give it to the
works of the house

1042 Moreover the five thousand sickles of silver which they
received from the account of the holy places every year shall also
belong to the priests that execute the ministry

1043 And whosoever shall flee into the temple that is in Jerusalem
and in all the borders thereof being indebted to the king for any
matter let them be set at liberty and all that they have in my
kingdom let them have it free

1044 For the building also or repairing the works of the holy
places the charges shall be given out of the kings revenues

1045 For the building also of the walls of Jerusalem and the
fortifying thereof round about the charges shall be given out of the
kings account as also for the building of the walls in Judea

1046 Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words they gave no
credit to them nor received them because they remembered the great
evil that he had done in Israel for he had afflicted them exceedingly

1047 And their inclinations were towards Alexander because he had
been the chief promoter of peace in their regard and him they always
helped

1048 And king Alexander gathered together a great army and moved his
camp near to Demetrius

1049 And the two kings joined battle and the army of Demetrius fled
away and Alexander pursued after him and pressed them close

1050 And the battle was hard fought till the sun went down and
Demetrius was slain that day

1051 And Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king of Egypt with
words to this effect saying

Ptolemee  Surnamed Philometer

1052 Forasmuch as I am returned into my kingdom and am set in the
throne of my ancestors and have gotten the dominion and have
overthrown Demetrius and possessed our country

1053 And have joined battle with him and both he and his army have
been destroyed by us and we are placed in the throne of his kingdom

1054 Now therefore let us make friendship one with another and
give me now thy daughter to wife and I will be thy son in law and I
will give both thee and her gifts worthy of thee

1055 And king Ptolomee answered saying Happy is the day wherein
thou didst return to the land of thy fathers and sattest in the throne
of their kingdom

1056 And now I will do to thee as thou hast written but meet me at
Ptolemais that we may see one another and I may give her to thee as
thou hast said

1057 So Ptolemee went out of Egypt with Cleopatra his daughter and
he came to Ptolemais in the hundred and sixtysecond year

1058 And king Alexander met him and he gave him his daughter
Cleopatra and he celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais with great
glory after the manner of kings

1059 And king Alexander wrote to Jonathan that he should come and
meet him

1060 And he went honourably to Ptolemais and he met there the two
kings and he gave them much silver and gold and presents and he
found favour in their sight

1061 And some pestilent men of Israel men of a wicked life
assembled themselves against him to accuse him and the king gave no
heed to them

1062 And he commanded that Jonathans garments should be taken off
and that he should be clothed with purple and they did so And the
king made him sit by himself

1063 And he said to his princes Go out with him into the midst of
the city and make proclamation that no man complain against him of
any matter and that no man trouble him for any manner of cause

1064 So when his accusers saw his glory proclaimed and him clothed
with purple they all fled away

1065 And the king magnified him and enrolled him amongst his chief
friends and made him governor and partaker of his dominion

1066 And Jonathan returned into Jerusalem with peace and joy

1067 In the year one hundred and sixtyfive Demetrius the son of
Demetrius came from Crete into the land of his fathers

1068 And king Alexander heard of it and was much troubled and
returned to Antioch

1069 And king Demetrius made Apollonius his general who was governor
of Celesyria and he gathered together a great army and came to
Jamnia and he sent to Jonathan the high priest

1070 Saying Thou alone standest against us and I am laughed at and
reproached because thou shewest thy power against us in the mountains

1071 Now therefore if thou trustest in thy forces come down to us
into the plain and there let us try one another for with me is the
strength of war

1072 Ask and learn who I am and the rest that help me who also say
that your foot cannot stand before our face for thy fathers have twice
been put to flight in their own land

1073 And now how wilt thou be able to abide the horsemen and so
great an army in the plain where there is no stone nor rock nor
place to flee to

1074 Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius he was moved in
his mind and he chose ten thousand men and went out of Jerusalem and
Simon his brother met him to help him

1075 And they pitched their tents near Joppe but they shut him out
of the city because a garrison of Apollonius was in Joppe and he laid
siege to it

1076 And they that were in the city being affrighted opened the
gates to him so Jonathan took Joppe

1077 And Apollonius heard of it and he took three thousand horsemen
and a great army

1078 And he went to Azotus as one that was making a journey and
immediately he went forth into the plain because he had a great number
of horsemen and he trusted in them And Jonathan followed after him to
Azotus and they joined battle

1079 And Apollonius left privately in the camp a thousand horsemen
behind them

1080 And Jonathan knew that there was an ambush behind him and they
surrounded his army and cast darts at the people from morning till
evening

1081 But the people stood still as Jonathan had commanded them and
so their horses were fatigued

1082 Then Simon drew forth his army and attacked the legion for the
horsemen were wearied and they were discomfited by him and fled

1083 And they that were scattered about the plain fled into Azotus
and went into Bethdagon their idols temple there to save themselves

1084 But Jonathan set fire to Azotus and the cities that were round
about it and took the spoils of them and the temple of Dagon and all
them that were fled into it he burnt with fire

1085 So they that were slain by the sword with them that were burnt
were almost eight thousand men

1086 And Jonathan removed his army from thence and camped against
Ascalon and they went out of the city to meet him with great honour

1087 And Jonathan returned into Jerusalem with his people having
many spoils

1088 And it came to pass when Alexander the king heard these words
that he honoured Jonathan yet more

1089 And he sent him a buckle of gold as the custom is to be given
to such as are of the royal blood And he gave him Accaron and all the
borders thereof in possession



1 Machabees Chapter 11


Ptolemee invades the kingdom of Alexander the latter is slain and the
former dies soon after Demetrius honours Jonathan and is rescued by
the Jews from his own subjects in Antioch Antiochus the younger
favours Jonathan His exploits in divers places

111 And the king of Egypt gathered together an army like the sand
that lieth upon the sea shore and many ships and he sought to get the
kingdom of Alexander by deceit and join it to his own kingdom

112 And he went out into Syria with peaceable words and they opened
to him the cities and met him for king Alexander had ordered them to
go forth to meet him because he was his father in law

113 Now when Ptolemee entered into the cities he put garrisons of
soldiers in every city

114 And when he came near to Azotns they shewed him the temple of
Dagon that was burnt with fire and Azotus and the suburbs thereof
that were destroyed and the bodies that were cast abroad and the
graves of them that were slain in the battle which they had made near
the way

115 And they told the king that Jonathan had done these things to
make him odious but the king held his peace

116 And Jonathan came to meet the king at Joppe with glory and they
saluted one another and they lodged there

117 And Jonathan went with the king as far as the river called
Eleutherus and he returned into Jerusalem

118 And king Ptolemee got the dominion of the cities by the sea side
even to Seleucia and he devised evil designs against Alexander

119 And he sent ambassadors to Demetrius saying Come let us make a
league between us and I will give thee my daughter whom Alexander
hath and thou shalt reign in the kingdom of thy father

1110 For I repent that I have given him my daughter for he hath
sought to kill me

1111 And he slandered him because he coveted his kingdom

1112 And he took away his daughter and gave her to Demetrius and
alienated himself from Alexander and his enmities were made manifest

1113 And Ptolemee entered into Antioch and set two crowns upon his
head that of Egypt and that of Asia

1114 Now king Alexander was in Cilicia at that time because they
that were in those places had rebelled

1115 And when Alexander heard of it he came to give him battle and
king Ptolemee brought forth his army and met him with a strong power
and put him to flight

1116 And Alexander fled into Arabia there to be protected and king
Ptolemee was exalted

1117 And Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexanders head and sent it
to Ptolemee

1118 And king Ptolemee died the third day after and they that were
in the strong holds were destroyed by them that were within the camp

1119 And Demetrius reigned in the hundred and sixtyseventh year

1120 In those days Jonathan gathered together them that were in
Judea to take the castle that was in Jerusalem and they made many
engines of war against it

1121 Then some wicked men that hated their own nation went away to
king Demetrius and told him that Jonathan was besieging the castle

1122 And when he heard it he was angry and forthwith he came to
Ptolemais and wrote to Jonathan that he should not besiege the castle
but should come to him in haste and speak to him

1123 But when Jonathan heard this he bade them besiege it still and
he chose some of the ancients of Israel and of the priests and put
himself in danger

1124 And he took gold and silver and raiment and many other
presents and went to the king to Ptolemais and he found favour in his
sight

1125 And certain wicked men of his nation made complaints against
him

1126 And the king treated him as his predecessors had done before
and he exalted him in the sight of all his friends

1127 And he confirmed him in the high priesthood and all the honours
he had before and he made him the chief of his friends

1128 And Jonathan requested of the king that he would make Judea free
from tribute and the three governments and Samaria and the confines
thereof and he promised him three hundred talents

1129 And the king consented and he wrote letters to Jonathan of all
these things to this effect

1130 King Demetrius to his brother Jonathan and to the nation of
the Jews greeting

1131 We send you here a copy of the letter which we have written to
Lasthenes our parent concerning you that you might know it

1132 King Demetrius to Lasthenes his parent greetings

1133 We have determined to do good to the nation of the Jews who are
our friends and keep the things that are just with us for their good
will which they bear towards us

1134 We have ratified therefore unto them all the borders of Judea
and the three cities Apherema Lydda and Ramatha which are added to
Judea out of Samaria and all their confines to be set apart to all
them that sacrifice in Jerusalem instead of the payments which the
king received of them every year and for the fruits of the land and
of the trees

Apherema  is found only in the Greek version

1135 And as for other things that belonged to us of the tithes and
of the tributes from this time we discharge them of them the saltpans
also and the crowns that were presented to us

1136 We give all to them and nothing hereof shall be revoked from
this time forth and for ever

1137 Now therefore see that thou make a copy of these things and
let it be given to Jonathan and set upon the holy mountain in a
conspicuous place

1138 And king Demetrius seeing that the land was quiet before him
and nothing resisted him sent away all his forces every man to his
own place except the foreign army which he had drawn together from
the islands of the nations so all the troops of his fathers hated him

1139 Now there was one Tryphon who had been of Alexanders party
before who seeing that all the army murmured against Demetrius went
to Emalchuel the Arabian who brought up Antiochus the son of
Alexander

1140 And he pressed him much to deliver him to him that he might be
king in his fathers place and he told him all that Demetrius had
done and how his soldiers hated him And he remained there many days

1141 And Jonathan sent to king Demetrius desiring that he would cast
out them that were in the castle in Jerusalem and those that were in
the strong holds because they fought against Israel

1142 And Demetrius sent to Jonathan saying I will not only do this
for thee and for thy people but I will greatly honour thee and thy
nation when opportunity shall serve

1143 Now therefore thou shalt do well if thou send me men to help
me for all my army is gone from me

1144 And Jonathan sent him three thousand valiant men to Antioch and
they came to the king and the king was very glad of their coming

1145 And they that were of the city assembled themselves together to
the number of a hundred and twenty thousand men and would have killed
the king

1146 And the king fled into the palace and they of the city kept the
passages of the city and began to fight

1147 And the king called the Jews to his assistance and they came to
him all at once and they all dispersed themselves through the city

1148 And they slew in that day a hundred thousand men and they set
fire to the city and got many spoils that day and delivered the king

1149 And they that were of the city saw that the Jews had got the
city as they would and they were discouraged in their mind and cried
to the king making supplication and saying

150 Grant us peace and let the Jews cease from assaulting us and
the city

1151 And they threw down their arms and made peace and the Jews
were glorified in the sight of the king and in the sight of all that
were in his realm and were renowned throughout the kingdom and
returned to Jerusalem with many spoils

1152 So king Demetrius sat in the throne of his kingdom and the land
was quiet before him

1153 And he falsified all whatsoever he had said and alienated
himself from Jonathan and did not reward him according to the benefits
he had received from him but gave him great trouble

1154 And after this Tryphon returned and with him Antiochus the
young boy who was made king and put on the diadem

1155 And there assembled unto him all the hands which Demetrius had
sent away and they fought against Demetrius who turned his back and
fled

1156 And Tryphon took the elephants and made himself master of
Antioch

1157 And young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan saying I confirm thee in
the high priesthood and I appoint thee ruler over the four cities and
to be one of the kings friends

1158 And he sent him vessels of gold for his service and he gave him
leave to drink in gold and to be clothed in purple and to wear a
golden buckle

1159 And he made his brother Simon governor from the borders of
Tyre even to the confines of Egypt

1160 Then Jonathan went forth and passed through the cities beyond
the river and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves to him to
help him and he came to Ascalon and they met him honourably out of
the city

1161 And he went from thence to Gaza and they that were in Gaza shut
him out and he besieged it and burnt all the suburbs round about and
took the spoils

1162 And the men of Gaza made supplication to Jonathan and he gave
them the right hand and he took their sons for hostages and sent them
to Jerusalem and he went through the country as far as Damascus

1163 And Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius were come
treacherously to Cades which is in Galilee with a great army
purposing to remove him from the affairs of the kingdom

1164 And he went against them but left his brother Simon in the
country

1165 And Simon encamped against Bethsura and assaulted it many days
and shut them up

1166 And they desired him to make peace and he granted it them and
he cast them out from thence and took the city and placed a garrison
in it

1167 And Jonathan and his army encamped by the water of Genesar and
before it was light they were ready in the plain of Asor

1168 And behold the army of the strangers met him in the plain and
they laid an ambush for him in the mountains but he went out against
them

1169 And they that lay in ambush rose out of their places and joined
battle

1170 And all that were on Jonathans side fled and none was left of
them but Mathathias the son of Absalom and Judas the son of Calphi
chief captain of the army

1171 And Jonathan rent his garments and cast earth upon his head
and prayed

1172 And Jonathan turned again to them to battle and he put them to
flight and they fought

1173 And they of his part that fled saw this and they turned again
to him and they all with him pursued the enemies even to Cades to
their own camp and they came even thither

1174 And there fell of the aliens in that day three thousand men and
Jonathan returned to Jerusalem



1 Machabees Chapter 12


Jonathan renews his league with the Romans and Lacedemonians The
forces of Demetrius flee away from him He is deceived and made
prisoner by Tryphon

121 And Jonathan saw that the time served him and he chose certain
men and sent them to Rome to confirm and to renew the amity with
them

122 And he sent letters to the Spartans and to other places
according to the same form

123 And they went to Rome and entered into the senate house and
said Jonathan the high priest and the nation of the Jews have sent
us to renew the amity and alliance as it was before

124 And they gave them letters to their governors in every place to
conduct them into the land of Juda with peace

125 And this is a copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the
Spartans

126 Jonathan the high priest and the ancients of the nation and
the priests and the rest of the people of the Jews to the Spartans
their brethren greeting

127 There were letters sent long ago to Onias the high priest from
Arius who reigned then among you to signify that you are our brethren
as the copy here underwritten doth specify

128 And Onias received the ambassador with honour and received the
letters wherein there was mention made of the alliance and amity

129 We though we needed none of these things having for our comfort
the holy books that are in our hands

1210 Chose rather to send to you to renew the brotherhood and
friendship lest we should become stranger to you altogether for there
is a long time passed since you sent to us

1211 We therefore at all times without ceasing both in our
festivals and other days wherein it is convenient remember you in the
sacrifices that we offer and in our observances as it is meet and
becoming to remember brethren

1212 And we rejoice at your glory

1213 But we have had many troubles and wars on every side and the
kings that are round about us have fought against us

1214 But we would not be troublesome to you nor to the rest of our
allies and friends in these wars

1215 For we have had help from heaven and we have been delivered
and our enemies are humbled

1216 We have chosen therefore Numenius the son of Antiochus and
Antipater the son of Jason and have sent them to the Romans to renew
with them the former amity and alliance

1217 And we have commanded them to go also to you and salute you
and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of our
brotherhood

1218 And now you shall do well to give us an answer hereto

1219 And this is the copy of the letter which he had sent to Onias

1220 Arius king of the Spartans to Onias the high priest
greeting

1221 It is found in writing concerning the Spartans and the Jews
that they are brethren and that they are of the stock of Abraham

1222 And now since this is come to our knowledge you do well to
write to us of your prosperity

1223 And we also have written back to you That our cattle and our
possessions are yours and yours ours We therefore have commanded
that these things should be told you

1224 Now Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius were come
again with a greater army than before to fight against him

1225 So he went out from Jerusalem and met them in the land of
Amath for he gave them no time to enter into his country

1226 And he sent spies into their camp and they came back and
brought him word that they designed to come upon them in the night

1227 And when the sun was set Jonathan commanded his men to watch
and to be in arms all night long ready to fight and he set sentinels
round about the camp

1228 And the enemies heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for
battle and they were struck with fear and dread in their heart and
they kindled fires in their camp

1229 But Jonathan and they that were with him knew it not till the
morning for they saw the lights burning

1230 And Jonathan pursued after them but overtook them not for they
had passed the river Eleutherus

1231 And Jonathan turned upon the Arabians that are called
Zabadeans and he defeated them and took the spoils of them

1232 And he went forward and came to Damascus and passed through
all that country

1233 Simon also went forth and came as far as Ascalon and the
neighbouring fortresses and he turned aside to Joppe and took
possession of it

1234 For he heard that they designed to deliver the hold to them
that took part with Demetrius and he put a garrison there to keep it

1235 And Jonathan came back and called together the ancients of the
people and he took a resolution with them to build fortresses in
Judea

1236 And to build up walls in Jerusalem and raise a mount between
the castle and the city to separate it from the city that so it might
have no communication and that they might neither buy nor sell

1237 And they came together to build up the city for the wall that
was upon the brook towards the east was broken down and he repaired
that which is called Caphetetha

1238 And Simon built Adiada in Sephela and fortified it and set up
gates and bars

1239 Now when Tryphon had conceived a design to make himself king of
Asia and to take the crown and to stretch out his hand against king
Antiochus

1240 Fearing lest Jonathan would not suffer him but would fight
against him he sought to seize upon him and to kill him So he rose
up and came to Bethsan

1241 And Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen
for battle and came to Bethsan

1242 Now when Tryphon saw that Jonathan came with a great army he
durst not stretch forth his hand against him

1243 But received him with honour and commended him to all his
friends and gave him presents and he commanded his troops to obey
him as himself

1244 And he said to Jonathan Why hast thou troubled all the people
whereas we have no war

1245 Now therefore send them back to their own houses and choose
thee a few men that may be with thee and come with me to Ptolemais
and I will deliver it to thee and the rest of the strong holds and
the army and all that have any charge and I will return and go away
for this is the cause of my coming

1246 And Jonathan believed him and did as he said and sent away his
army and they departed into the land of Juda

1247 But he kept with him three thousand men of whom he sent two
thousand into Galilee and one thousand went with him

1248 Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais they of
Ptolemais shut the gates of the city and took him and all them that
came in with him they slew with the sword

1249 Then Tryphon sent an army and horsemen into Galilee and into
the great plain to destroy all Jonathans company

1250 But they when they understood that Jonathan and all that were
with him were taken and slain encouraged one another and went out
ready for battle

1251 Then they that had come after them seeing that they stood for
their lives returned back

1252 Whereupon they all came peaceably into the land of Juda and they
bewailed Jonathan and them that had been with him exceedingly and
Israel mourned with great lamentation

1253 Then all the heathens that were round about them sought to
destroy them For they said

1254 They have no prince nor any to help them now therefore let us
make war upon them and take away the memory of them from amongst men



1 Machabees Chapter 13


Simon is made captain general in the room of his brother Jonathan is
slain by Tryphon Simon is favoured by Demetrius he taketh Gaza and
the castle of Jerusalem

131 Now Simon heard that Tryphon was gathering together a very great
army to invade the land of Juda and to destroy it

132 And seeing that the people was in dread and in fear he went up
to Jerusalem and assembled the people

133 And exhorted them saying You know what great battles I and my
brethren and the house of my father have fought for the laws and the
sanctuary and the distresses that we have seen

134 By reason whereof all my brethren have lost their lives for
Israels sake and I am left alone

135 And now far be it from me to spare my life in any time of
trouble for I am not better than my brethren

136 I will avenge then my nation and the sanctuary and our children
and wives for all the heathens are gathered together to destroy us out
of mere malice

137 And the spirit of the people was enkindled as soon as they heard
these words

138 And they answered with a loud voice saying Thou art our leader
in the place of Judas and Jonathan thy brother

139 Fight thou our battles and we will do whatsoever thou shalt say
to us

1310 So gathering together all the men of war he made haste to
finish all the walls of Jerusalem and he fortified it round about

1311 And he sent Jonathan the son of Absalom and with him a new
army into Joppe and he cast out them that were in it and himself
remained there

1312 And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a great army to invade
the land of Juda and Jonathan was with him in custody

1313 But Simon pitched in Addus over against the plain

1314 And when Tryphon understood that Simon was risen up in the place
of his brother Jonathan and that he meant to join battle with him he
sent messengers to him

1315 Saying We have detained thy brother Jonathan for the money
that he owed in the kings account by reason of the affairs which he
had the management of

1316 But now send a hundred talents of silver and his two sons for
hostages that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us and
we will release him

1317 Now Simon knew that he spoke deceitfully to him nevertheless
he ordered the money and the children to be sent lest he should bring
upon himself a great hatred of the people of Israel who might have
said

1318 Because he sent not the money and the children therefore is he
lost

1319 So he sent the children and the hundred talents and he lied and
did not let Jonathan go

1320 And after this Tryphon entered within the country to destroy
it and they went about by the way that leadeth to Ador and Simon and
his army marched to every place whithersoever they went

Simon and his army marched to every place whithersoever they
went  That is whithersoever Tryphon and his horsemen went in order
to oppose them

1321 And they that were in the castle sent messengers to Tryphon
that he should make haste to come through the desert and send them
victuals

1322 And Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night but
there fell a very great snow and he came not into the country of
Galaad

1323 And when he approached to Bascama he slew Jonathan and his sons
there

1324 And Tryphon returned and went into his own country

1325 And Simon sent and took the bones of Jonathan his brother and
buried them in Modin the city of his fathers

1326 And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation and they
mourned for him many days

1327 And Simon built over the sepulchre of his father and of his
brethren a building lofty to the sight of polished stone behind and
before

1328 And he set up seven pyramids one against another for his
father and his mother and his four brethren

1329 And round about these he set great pillars and upon the
pillars arms for a perpetual memory and by the arms ships carved
which might be seen by all that sailed on the sea

1330 This is the sepulchre that he made in Modin even unto this day

1331 But Tryphon when he was upon a journey with the young king
Antiochus treacherously slew him

1332 And he reigned in his place and put on the crown of Asia and
brought great evils upon the land

1333 And Simon built up the strong holds of Judea fortifying them
with high towers and great walls and gates and bars and he stored up
victuals in the fortresses

1334 And Simon chose men and sent to king Demetrius to the end that
he should grant an immunity to the land for all that Tryphon did was
to spoil

1335 And king Demetrius in answer to this request wrote a letter in
this manner

1336 King Demetrius to Simon the high priest and friend of kings
and to the ancients and to the nation of the Jews greeting

1337 The golden crown and the palm which you sent we have
received and we are ready to make a firm peace with you and to write
to the kings chief officers to release you the things that we have
released

1338 For all that we have decreed in your favour shall stand in
force The strong holds that you have built shall be your own

1339 And as for any oversight or fault committed unto this day we
forgive it and the crown which you owed and if any other thing were
taxed in Jerusalem now let it not be taxed

1340 And if any of you be fit to be enrolled among ours let them be
enrolled and let there be peace between us

1341 In the year one hundred and seventy the yoke of the Gentiles
was taken off from Israel

1342 And the people of Israel began to write in the instruments and
public records The first year under Simon the high priest the great
captain and prince of the Jews

1343 In those days Simon besieged Gaza and camped round about it
and he made engines and set them to the city and he struck one tower
and took it

1344 And they that were within the engine leapt into the city and
there was a great uproar in the city

1345 And they that were in the city went up with their wives and
children upon the wall with their garments rent and they cried with
a loud voice beseeching Simon to grant them peace

1346 And they said Deal not with us according to our evil deeds but
according to thy mercy

1347 And Simon being moved did not destroy them but yet he cast them
out of the city and cleansed the houses wherein there had been idols
and then he entered into it with hymns blessing the Lord

1348 And having cast out of it all uncleanness he placed in it men
that should observe the law and he fortified it and made it his
habitation

1349 But they that were in the castle of Jerusalem were hindered from
going out and coming into the country and from buying and selling and
they were straitened with hunger and many of them perished through
famine

1350 And they cried to Simon for peace and he granted it to them
and he cast them out from thence and cleansed the castle from
uncleannesses

1351 And they entered into it the three and twentieth day of the
second month in the year one hundred and seventyone with
thanksgiving and branches of palm trees and harps and cymbals and
psalteries and hymns and canticles because the great enemy was
destroyed out of Israel

1352 And he ordained that these days should be kept every year with
gladness

1353 And he fortified the mountain of the temple that was near the
castle and he dwelt there himself and they that were with him

1354 And Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man for war and
he made him captain of all the forces and he dwelt in Gazara



1 Machabees Chapter 14


Demetrius is taken by the king of Persia Judea flourishes under the
government of Simon

141 In the year one hundred and seventytwo king Demetrius assembled
his army and went into Media to get him succours to fight against
Tryphon

142 And Arsaces the king of Persia and Media heard that Demetrius
was entered within his borders and he sent one of his princes to take
him alive and bring him to him

143 And he went and defeated the army of Demetrius and took him
and brought him to Arsaces and he put him into custody

144 And all the land of Juda was at rest all the days of Simon and
he sought the good of his nation and his power and his glory pleased
them well all his days

145 And with all his glory he took Joppe for a haven and made an
entrance to the isles of the sea

146 And he enlarged the bounds of his nation and made himself master
of the country

147 And he gathered together a great number of captives and had the
dominion of Gazara and of Bethsura and of the castle and took away
all uncleanness out of it and there was none that resisted him

148 And every man tilled his land with peace and the land of Juda
yielded her increase and the trees of the fields their fruit

149 The ancient men sat all in the streets and treated together of
the good things of the land and the young men put on them glory and
the robes of war

1410 And he provided victuals for the cities and he appointed that
they should be furnished with ammunition so that the fame of his glory
was renowned even to the end of the earth

1411 He made peace in the land and Israel rejoiced with great joy

1412 And every man sat under his vine and under his fig tree and
there was none to make them afraid

1413 There was none left in the land to fight against them kings
were discomfited in those days

1414 And he strengthened all those of his people that were brought
low and he sought the law and took away every unjust and wicked man

1415 He glorified the sanctuary and multiplied the vessels of the
holy places

1416 And it was heard at Rome and as far as Sparta that Jonathan
was dead and they were very sorry

1417 But when they heard that Simon his brother was made high
priest in his place and was possessed of all the country and the
cities therein

1418 They wrote to him in tables of brass to renew the friendship
and alliance which they had made with Judas and with Jonathan his
brethren

1419 And they were read before the assembly in Jerusalem And this is
the copy of the letters that the Spartans sent

1420 The princes and the cities of the Spartans to Simon the high
priest and to the ancients and the priests and the rest of the
people of the Jews their brethren greeting

1421 The ambassadors that were sent to our people have told us of
your glory and honour and joy and we rejoiced at their coming

1422 And we registered what was said by them in the councils of the
people in this manner Numenius the son of Antiochus and Antipater
the son of Jason ambassadors of the Jews came to us to renew the
former friendship with us

1423 And it pleased the people to receive the men honourably and to
put a copy of their words in the public records to be a memorial to
the people of the Spartans And we have written a copy of them to
Simon the high priest

1424 And after this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shield
of gold of the weight of a thousand pounds to confirm the league with
them And when the people of Rome had heard

1425 These words they said What thanks shall we give to Simon and
his sons

1426 For he hath restored his brethren and hath driven away in fight
the enemies of Israel from them and they decreed him liberty and
registered it in tables of brass and set it upon pillars in mount
Sion

1427 And this is a copy of the writing The eighteenth day of the
month Elul in the year one hundred and seventytwo being the third
year under Simon the high priest at Asaramel

1428 In a great assembly of the priests and of the people and the
princes of the nation and the ancients of the country these things
were notified Forasmuch as there have often been wars in our country

1429 And Simon the son of Mathathias of the children of Jarib and
his brethren have put themselves in danger and resisted the enemies
of their nation for the maintenance of their holy places and the law
and have raised their nation to great glory

1430 And Jonathan gathered together his nation and was made their
high priest and he was laid to his people

1431 And their enemies desired to tread down and destroy their
country and to stretch forth their hands against their holy places

1432 Then Simon resisted and fought for his nation and laid out much
of his money and armed the valiant men of his nation and gave them
wages

1433 And he fortified the cities of Judea and Bethsura that lieth in
the borders of Judea where the armour of the enemies was before and
he placed there a garrison of Jews

1434 And he fortified Joppe which lieth by the sea and Gazara
which bordereth upon Azotus wherein the enemies dwelt before and he
placed Jews here and furnished them with all things convenient for
their reparation

1435 And the people seeing the acts of Simon and to what glory he
meant to bring his nation made him their prince and high priest
because he had done all these things and for the justice and faith
which he kept to his nation and for that he sought by all means to
advance his people

1436 And in his days things prospered in his hands so that the
heathens were taken away out of their country and they also that were
in the city of David in Jerusalem in the castle out of which they
issued forth and profaned all places round about the sanctuary and
did much evil to purity

1437 And he placed therein Jews for the defence of the country and
of the city and he raised up the walls of Jerusalem

1438 And king Demetrius confirmed him in the high priesthood

1439 According to these things he made him his friend and glorified
him with great glory

1440 For he had heard that the Romans had called the Jews their
friends and confederates and brethren and that they had received
Simons ambassadors with honour

1441 And that the Jews and their priests had consented that he
should be their prince and high priest for ever till there should
arise a faithful prophet

1442 And that he should be chief over them and that he should have
the charge of the sanctuary and that he should appoint rulers over
their works and over the country and over the armour and over the
strong holds

1443 And that he should have care of the holy places and that he
should be obeyed by all and that all the writings in the country
should be made in his name and that he should be clothed with purple
and gold

1444 And that it should not be lawful for any of the people or of
the priests to disannul any of these things or to gainsay his words
or to call together an assembly in the country without him or to be
clothed with purple or to wear a buckle of gold

1445 And whosoever shall do otherwise or shall make void any of
these things shall be punished

1446 And it pleased all the people to establish Simon and to do
according to these words

1447 And Simon accepted thereof and was well pleased to execute the
office of the high priesthood and to be captain and prince of the
nation of the Jews and of the priests and to be chief over all

1448 And they commanded that this writing should be put in tables of
brass and that they should be set up within the compass of the
sanctuary in a conspicuous place

1449 And that a copy thereof should be put in the treasury that
Simon and his sons may have it



1 Machabees Chapter 15


Antiochus son of Demetrius honours Simon The Romans write to divers
nations in favour of the Jews Antiochus quarrels with Simon and sends
troops to annoy him

151 And king Antiochus the son of Demetrius sent letters from the
isles of the sea to Simon the priest and prince of the nation of the
Jews and to all the people

152 And the contents were these King Antiochus to Simon the high
priest and to the nation of the Jews greeting

153 Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of
our fathers and my purpose is to challenge the kingdom and to restore
it to its former estate and I have chosen a great army and have built
ships of war

154 And I design to go through the country that I may take revenge
of them that have destroyed our country and that have made many cities
desolate in my realm

155 Now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which all
the kings before me remitted to thee and what other gifts soever they
remitted to thee

156 And I give thee leave to coin thy own money in thy country

157 And let Jerusalem be holy and free and all the armour that hath
been made and the fortresses which thou hast built and which thou
keepest in thy hands let them remain to thee

158 And all that is due to the king and what should be the kings
hereafter from this present and for ever is forgiven thee

159 And when we shall have recovered our kingdom we will glorify
thee and thy nation and the temple with great glory so that your
glory shall be made manifest in all the earth

1510 In the year one hundred and seventyfour Antiochus entered into
the land of his fathers and all the forces assembled to him so that
few were left with Tryphon

1511 And king Antiochus pursued after him and he fled along by the
sea coast and came to Dora

1512 For he perceived that evils were gathered together upon him and
his troops had forsaken him

1513 And Antiochus camped above Dora with a hundred and twenty
thousand men of war and eight thousand horsemen

1514 And he invested the city and the ships drew near by sea and
they annoyed the city by land and by sea and suffered none to come
in or to go out

1515 And Numenius and they that had been with him came from the
city of Rome having letters written to the kings and countries the
contents whereof were these

1516 Lucius the consul of the Romans to king Ptolemee greeting

Ptolemee  Surnamed Physeon brother and successor to Philometer

1517 The ambassadors of the Jews our friends came to us to renew
the former friendship and alliance being sent from Simon the high
priest and the people of the Jews

1518 And they brought also a shield of gold of a thousand pounds

1519 It hath seemed good therefore to us to write to the kings and
countries that they should do them no harm nor fight against them
their cities or countries and that they should give no aid to them
that fight against them

1520 And it hath seemed good to us to receive the shield of them

1521 If therefore any pestilent men are fled out of their country
to you deliver them to Simon the high priest that he may punish them
according to their law

1522 These same things were written to king Demetrius and to
Attalus and to Ariarathes and to Arsaces

Attalus etc  Attalus was king of Pergamus Ariarathes was king of
Cappadocia and Arsaces was king of the Parthians

1523 And to all the countries and to Lampsacus and to the Spartans
and to Delus and Myndus and Sicyon and Caria and Samus and
Pamphylia and Lycia and Alicarnassus and Cos and Side and Aradus
and Rhodes and Phaselis and Gortyna and Gnidus and Cyprus and
Cyrene

1524 And they wrote a copy thereof to Simon the high priest and to
the people of the Jews

1525 But king Antiochus moved his camp to Dora the second time
assaulting it continually and making engines and he shut up Tryphon
that he could not go out

1526 And Simon sent to him two thousand chosen men to aid him silver
also and gold and abundance of furniture

1527 And he would not receive them but broke all the covenant that
he had made with him before and alienated himself from him

1528 And he sent to him Athenobius one of his friends to treat with
him saying You hold Joppe and Gazara and the castle that is in
Jerusalem which are cities of my kingdom

1529 Their borders you have wasted and you have made great havoc in
the land and have got the dominion of many places in my kingdom

1530 Now therefore deliver up the cities that you have taken and
the tributes of the places whereof you have gotten the dominion without
the borders of Judea

1531 But if not give me for them five hundred talents of silver and
for the havoc that you have made and the tributes of the cities other
five hundred talents or else we will come and fight against you

1532 So Athenobius the kings friend came to Jerusalem and saw the
glory of Simon and his magnificence in gold and silver and his great
equipage and he was astonished and told him the kings words

1533 And Simon answered him and said to him We have neither taken
other mens land neither do we hold that which is other mens but the
inheritance of our fathers which was for some time unjustly possessed
by our enemies

1534 But we having opportunity claim the inheritance of our fathers

1535 And as to thy complaints concerning Joppe and Gazara they did
great harm to the people and to our country yet for these we will
give a hundred talents And Athenobius answered him not a word

1536 But returning in a rage to the king made report to him of these
words and of the glory of Simon and of all that he had seen and the
king was exceeding angry

1537 And Tryphon fled away by ship to Orthosias

1538 And the king appointed Cendebeus captain of the sea coast and
gave him an army of footmen and horsemen

1539 And he commanded him to march with his army towards Judea and
he commanded him to build up Gedor and to fortify the gates of the
city and to war against the people But the king himself pursued after
Tryphon

1540 And Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the people
and to ravage Judea and to take the people prisoners and to kill and
to build Gedor

1541 And he placed there horsemen and an army that they might issue
forth and make incursions upon the ways of Judea as the king had
commanded him



1 Machabees Chapter 16


The sons of Simon defeat the troops of Antiochus Simon with two of his
sons are treacherously murdered by Ptolemee his son in law

161 Then John came up from Gazara and told Simon his father what
Cendebeus had done against their people

John  He was afterwards surnamed Hircanus and succeeded his father
in both his dignities of high priest and prince He conquered the
Edomites and obliged them to a conformity with the Jews in religion
and destroyed the schismatical temple of the Samaritans

162 And Simon called his two eldest sons Judas and John and said to
them I and my brethren and my fathers house have fought against the
enemies of Israel from our youth even to this day and things have
prospered so well in our hands that we have delivered Israel
oftentimes

163 And now I am old but be you instead of me and my brethren and
go out and fight for our nation and the help from heaven be with you

164 Then he chose out of the country twenty thousand fighting men
and horsemen and they went forth against Cendebeus and they rested in
Modin

165 And they arose in the morning and went into the plain and
behold a very great army of footmen and horsemen came against them and
there was a running river between them

166 And he and his people pitched their camp over against them and
he saw that the people were afraid to go over the river so he went
over first then the men seeing him passed over after him

He  Viz John

167 And he divided the people and set the horsemen in the midst of
the footmen but the horsemen of the enemies were very numerous

168 And they sounded the holy trumpets and Cendebeus and his army
were put to flight and there fell many of them wounded and the rest
fled into the strong hold

169 At that time Judas Johns brother was wounded but John
pursued after them till he came to Cedron which he had built

Cedron  Otherwise called Gedon the city that Cendebeus was
fortifying

1610 And they fled even to the towers that were in the fields of
Azotus and he burnt them with fire And there fell of them two
thousand men and he returned into Judea in peace

1611 Now Ptolemee the son of Abobus was appointed captain in the
plain of Jericho and he had abundance of silver and gold

1612 For he was son in law of the high priest

1613 And his heart was lifted up and he designed to make himself
master of the country and he purposed treachery against Simon and his
sons to destroy them

1614 Now Simon as he was going through the cities that were in the
country of Judea and taking care for the good ordering of them went
down to Jericho he and Mathathias and Judas his sons in the year one
hundred and seventyseven the eleventh month the same is the month
Sabath

1615 And the son of Abobus received them deceitfully into a little
fortress that is called Doch which he had built and he made them a
great feast and hid men there

1616 And when Simon and his sons had drunk plentifully Ptolemee and
his men rose up and took their weapons and entered into the
banqueting place and slew him and his two sons and some of his
servants

1617 And he committed a great treachery in Israel and rendered evil
for good

1618 And Ptolemee wrote these things and sent to the king that he
should send him an army to aid him and he would deliver him the
country and their cities and tributes

1619 And he sent others to Gazara to kill John and to the tribunes
he sent letters to come to him and that he would give them silver and
gold and gifts

1620 And he sent others to take Jerusalem and the mountain of the
temple

1621 Now one running before told John in Gazara that his father and
his brethren were slain and that he hath sent men to kill thee also

1622 But when he heard it he was exceedingly afraid and he
apprehended the men that came to kill him and he put them to death
for he knew that they sought to make him away

1623 And as concerning the rest of the acts of John and his wars
and the worthy deeds which he bravely achieved and the building of
the walls which he made and the things that he did

1624 Behold these are written in the book of the days of his
priesthood from the time that he was made high priest after his
father




THE SECOND BOOK OF MACHABEES



This second book of MACHABEES is not a continuation of the history
contained in the first nor does is come down so low as the first does
but relates many of the same facts more at large and adds other
remarkable particulars omitted in the first book relating to the
state of the Jews as well before as under the persecution of
ANTIOCHUS The author who is not the same with that of the first book
has given as we learn from chap 220 etc a short abstract of what
JASON of Cyrene had written in the five volumes concerning JUDAS and
his brethren He wrote in Greek and begins with two letters sent by
the Jews of Jerusalem to their brethren in Egypt



2 Machabees Chapter 1


Letters of the Jews of Jerusalem to them that were in Egypt They give
thanks for their delivery from Antiochus and exhort their brethren to
keep the feast of the dedication of the altar and of the miraculous
fire

11 To the brethren the Jews that are throughout Egypt the brethren
the Jews that are in Jerusalem and in the land of Judea send health
and good peace

12 May God be gracious to you and remember his covenant that he made
with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob his faithful servants

13 And give you all a heart to worship him and to do his will with a
great heart and a willing mind

14 May he open your heart in his law and in his commandments and
send you peace

15 May he hear your prayers and be reconciled unto you and never
forsake you in the evil time

16 And now here we are praying for you

17 When Demetrius reigned in the year one hundred and sixtynine we
Jews wrote to you in the trouble and violence that came upon us in
those years after Jason withdrew himself from the holy land and from
the kingdom

18 They burnt the gate and shed innocent blood then we prayed to
the Lord and were heard and we offered sacrifices and fine flour
and lighted the lamps and set forth the loaves

19 And now celebrate ye the days of Scenopegia in the month of
Casleu

Scenopegia  Viz the Encenia or feast of the dedication of the
altar called here Scenopegia or feast of tabernacles from being
celebrated with the like solemnity

110 In the year one hundred and eightyeight the people that is at
Jerusalem and in Judea and the senate and Judas to Aristobolus the
preceptor of king Ptolemee who is of the stock of the anointed
priests and to the Jews that are in Egypt health and welfare

111 Having been delivered by God out of great dangers we give him
great thanks forasmuch as we have been in war with such a king

Such a king  Viz Antiochus Sidetes who began to make war upon the
Jews whilst Simon was yet alive 1 Mac 1539 And afterwards besieged
Jerusalem under John Hircanus So that the Judas here mentioned ver
10 is not Judas Machabeus who was dead long before the year 188 of
the kingdom of the Greeks for he died in the year 146 of that epoch
see above 1 Mac chap 2 ver 70 also the note on chap 1 ver 2
but either Judas the eldest son of John Hircanus or Judas the Essene
renowned for the gift of prophecy who flourished about that time

112 For he made numbers of men swarm out of Persia that have fought
against us and the holy city

113 For when the leader himself was in Persia and with him a very
great army he fell in the temple of Nanea being deceived by the
counsel of the priests of Nanea

Nanea  A Persian goddess which some have taken for Diana others for
Venus

114 For Antiochus with his friends came to the place as though he
would marry her and that he might receive great sums of money under
the title of a dowry

115 And when the priests of Nanea had set it forth and he with a
small company had entered into the compass of the temple they shut the
temple

116 When Antiochus was come in and opening a secret entrance of the
temple they cast stones and slew the leader and them that were with
him and hewed them in pieces and cutting off their heads they threw
them forth

117 Blessed be God in all things who hath delivered up the wicked

118 Therefore whereas we purpose to keep the purification of the
temple on the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu we thought
it necessary to signify it to you that you also may keep the day of
Scenopegia and the day of the fire that was given when Nehemias
offered sacrifice after the temple and the altar was built

119 For when our fathers were led into Persia the priests that then
were worshippers of God took privately the fire from the altar and
hid it in a valley where there was a deep pit without water and there
they kept it safe so that the place was unknown to all men

Persia  Babylonia called here Persia from being afterwards a part
of the Persian empire

120 But when many years had passed and it pleased God that Nehemias
should be sent by the king of Persia he sent some of the posterity of
those priests that had hid it to seek for the fire and as they told
us they found no fire but thick water

121 Then he bade them draw it up and bring it to him and the
priest Nehemias commanded the sacrifices that were laid on to be
sprinkled with the same water both the wood and the things that were
laid upon it

122 And when this was done and the time came that the sun shone out
which before was in a cloud there was a great fire kindled so that
all wondered

123 And all the priests made prayer while the sacrifice was
consuming Jonathan beginning and the rest answering

124 And the prayer of Nehemias was after this manner O Lord God
Creator of all things dreadful and strong just and merciful who
alone art the good king

125 Who alone art gracious who alone art just and almighty and
eternal who deliverest Israel from all evil who didst choose the
fathers and didst sanctify them

126 Receive the sacrifice for all thy people Israel and preserve thy
own portion and sanctify it

127 Gather together our scattered people deliver them that are
slaves to the Gentiles and look upon them that are despised and
abhorred that the Gentiles may know that thou art our God

128 Punish them that oppress us and that treat us injuriously with
pride

129 Establish thy people in thy holy place as Moses hath spoken

130 And the priests sung hymns till the sacrifice was consumed

131 And when the sacrifice was consumed Nehemias commanded the water
that was left to be poured out upon the great stones

132 Which being done there was kindled a flame from them but it was
consumed by the light that shined from the altar

133 And when this matter became public it was told to the king of
Persia that in the place where the priests that were led away had hid
the fire there appeared water with which Nehemias and they that were
with him had purified the sacrifices

134 And the king considering and diligently examining the matter
made a temple for it that he might prove what had happened

A temple  That is an enclosure or a wall round about the place
where the fire was hid to separate it from profane uses to the end
that it might be respected as a holy place

135 And when he had proved it he gave the priests many goods and
divers presents and he took and distributed them to them with his own
hand

136 And Nehemias called this place Nephthar which is interpreted
purification But many call it Nephi



2 Machabees Chapter 2


A continuation of the second letter Of Jeremias hiding the ark at the
time of the captivity The authors preface

21Now it is found in the descriptions of Jeremias the prophet that
he commanded them that went into captivity to take the fire as it
hath been signified and how he gave charge to them that were carried
away into captivity

The descriptions  That is the records or memoirs of Jeremias a work
that is now lost

22 And how he gave them the law that they should not forget the
commandments of the Lord and that they should not err in their minds
seeing the idols of gold and silver and the ornaments of them

23 And with other such like speeches he exhorted them that they
would not remove the law from their heart

24 It was also contained in the same writing how the prophet being
warned by God commanded that the tabernacle and the ark should
accompany him till he came forth to the mountain where Moses went up
and saw the inheritance of God

25 And when Jeremias came thither he found a hollow cave and he
carried in thither the tabernacle and the ark and the altar of
incense and so stopped the door

26 Then some of them that followed him came up to mark the place
but they could not find it

27 And when Jeremias perceived it he blamed them saying The place
shall be unknown till God gather together the congregation of the
people and receive them to mercy

28 And then the Lord will shew these things and the majesty of the
Lord shall appear and there shall be a cloud as it was also shewed to
Moses and he shewed it when Solomon prayed that the place might be
sanctified to the great God

29 For he treated wisdom in a magnificent manner and like a wise
man he offered the sacrifice of the dedication and of the finishing
of the temple

210 And as Moses prayed to the Lord and fire came down from heaven
and consumed the holocaust so Solomon also prayed and fire came down
from heaven and consumed the holocaust

211 And Moses said Because the sin offering was not eaten it was
consumed

212 So Solomon also celebrated the dedication eight days

213 And these same things were set down in the memoirs and
commentaries of Nehemias and how he made a library and gathered
together out of the countries the books both of the prophets and of
David and the epistles of the kings and concerning the holy gifts

214 And in like manner Judas also gathered together all such things
as were lost by the war we had and they are in our possession

215 Wherefore if you want these things send some that may fetch
them to you

216 As we are then about to celebrate the purification we have
written unto you and you shall do well if you keep the same days

The purification  That is the feast of the purifying or cleansing of
the temple

217 And we hope that God who hath delivered his people and hath
rendered to all the inheritance and the kingdom and the priesthood
and the sanctuary

218 As he promised in the law will shortly have mercy upon us and
will gather us together from every land under heaven into the holy
place

219 For he hath delivered us out of great perils and hath cleansed
the place

220 Now as concerning Judas Machabeus and his brethren and the
purification of the great temple and the dedication of the altar

221 As also the wars against Antiochus the Illustrious and his son
Eupator

222 And the manifestations that came from heaven to them that
behaved themselves manfully on the behalf of the Jews so that being
but a few they made themselves masters of the whole country and put to
flight the barbarous multitude

223 And recovered again the most renowned temple in all the world
and delivered the city and restored the laws that were abolished the
Lord with all clemency shewing mercy to them

224 And all such things as have been comprised in five books by
Jason of Cyrene we have attempted to abridge in one book

225 For considering the multitude of books and the difficulty that
they find that desire to undertake the narrations of histories because
of the multitude of the matter

226 We have taken care for those indeed that are willing to read
that it might be a pleasure of mind and for the studious that they
may more easily commit to memory and that all that read might receive
profit

227 And as to ourselves indeed in undertaking this work of
abridging we have taken in hand no easy task yea rather a business
full of watching and sweat

No easy task etc  The spirit of God that assists the sacred penmen
does not exempt them from labour in seeking out the matter which they
are to treat of and the order and manner in which they are to deliver
it So St Luke writ the gospel having diligently attained to all
things Luke 1 ver 3

228 But as they that prepare a feast and seek to satisfy the will of
others for the sake of many we willingly undergo the labour

229 Leaving to the authors the exact handling of every particular
and as for ourselves according to the plan proposed studying to be
brief

230 For as the master builder of a new house must have care of the
whole building but he that taketh care to paint it must seek out fit
things for the adorning of it so must it be judged of us

231 For to collect all that is to be known to put the discourse in
order and curiously to discuss every particular point is the duty of
the author of a history

232 But to pursue brevity of speech and to avoid nice declarations
of things is to be granted to him that maketh an abridgment

233 Here then we will begin the narration let this be enough by way
of a preface for it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue and to
be short in the story itself



2 Machabees Chapter 3


Heliodorus is sent by king Seleucus to take away the treasures
deposited in the temple He is struck by God and healed by the prayers
of the high priest

31 Therefore when the holy city was inhabited with all peace and
the laws as yet were very well kept because of the godliness of Onias
the high priest and the hatred his soul had of evil

32 It came to pass that even the kings themselves and the princes
esteemed the place worthy of the highest honour and glorified the
temple with very great gifts

33 So that Seleucus king of Asia allowed out of his revenues all
the charges belonging to the ministry of the sacrifices

Seleucus  Son of Antiochus the Great and elder brother of Antiochus
Epiphanes

34 But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin who was appointed
overseer of the temple strove in opposition to the high priest to
bring about some unjust thing in the city

35 And when he could not overcome Onias he went to Apollonius the
son of Tharseas who at that time was governor of Celesyria and
Phenicia

36 And told him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of immense
sums of money and the common store was infinite which did not belong
to the account of the sacrifices and that it was possible to bring all
into the kings hands

37 Now when Apollonius had given the king notice concerning the money
that he was told of he called for Heliodorus who had the charge over
his affairs and sent him with commission to bring him the foresaid
money

38 So Heliodorus forthwith began his journey under a colour of
visiting the cities of Celesyria and Phenicia but indeed to fulfil the
kings purpose

39 And when he was come to Jerusalem and had been courteously
received in the city by the high priest he told him what information
had been given concerning the money and declared the cause for which
he was come and asked if these things were so indeed

310 Then the high priest told him that these were sums deposited and
provisions for the subsistence of the widows and the fatherless

311 And that some part of that which wicked Simon had given
intelligence of belonged to Hircanus son of Tobias a man of great
dignity and that the whole was four hundred talents of silver and two
hundred of gold

312 But that to deceive them who had trusted to the place and temple
which is honoured throughout the whole world for the reverence and
holiness of it was a thing which could not by any means be done

313 But he by reason of the orders he had received from the king
said that by all means the money must be carried to the king

314 So on the day he had appointed Heliodorus entered in to order
this matter But there was no small terror throughout the whole city

315 And the priests prostrated themselves before the altar in their
priests vestments and called upon him from heaven who made the law
concerning things given to be kept that he would preserve them safe
for them that had deposited them

316 Now whosoever saw the countenance of the high priest was wounded
in heart for his face and the changing of his colour declared the
inward sorrow of his mind

317 For the man was so compassed with sadness and horror of the body
that it was manifest to them that beheld him what sorrow he had in his
heart

318 Others also came flocking together out of their houses praying
and making public supplication because the place was like to come into
contempt

319 And the women girded with haircloth about their breasts came
together in the streets And the virgins also that were shut up came
forth some to Onias and some to the walls and others looked out of
the windows

320 And all holding up their hands towards heaven made supplication

321 For the expectation of the mixed multitude and of the high
priest who was in an agony would have moved any one to pity

322 And these indeed called upon almighty God to preserve the things
that had been committed to them safe and sure for those that had
committed them

323 But Heliodorus executed that which he had resolved on himself
being present in the same place with his guard about the treasury

324 But the spirit of the Almighty God gave a great evidence of his
presence so that all that had presumed to obey him falling down by
the power of God were struck with fainting and dread

325 For there appeared to them a horse with a terrible rider upon
him adorned with a very rich covering and he ran fiercely and struck
Heliodorus with his fore feet and he that sat upon him seemed to have
armour of gold

326 Moreover there appeared two other young men beautiful and
strong bright and glorious and in comely apparel who stood by him
on either side and scourged him without ceasing with many stripes

327 And Heliodorus suddenly fell to the ground and they took him up
covered with great darkness and having put him into a litter they
carried him out

328 So he that came with many servants and all his guard into the
aforesaid treasury was carried out no one being able to help him the
manifest power of God being known

329 And he indeed by the power of God lay speechless and without
all hope of recovery

330 But they praised the Lord because he had glorified his place
and the temple that a little before was full of fear and trouble when
the Almighty Lord appeared was filled with joy and gladness

331 Then some of the friends of Heliodorus forthwith begged of Onias
that he would call upon the Most High to grant him his life who was
ready to give up the ghost

332 So the high priest considering that the king might perhaps
suspect that some mischief had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews
offered a sacrifice of health for the recovery of the man

333 And when the high priest was praying the same young men in the
same clothing stood by Heliodorus and said to him Give thanks to
Onias the priest because for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life

334 And thou having been scourged by God declare unto all men the
great works and the power of God And having spoken thus they appeared
no more

335 So Heliodorus after he had offered a sacrifice to God and made
great vows to him that had granted him life and given thanks to
Onias taking his troops with him returned to the king

336 And he testified to all men the works of the great God which he
had seen with his own eyes

337 And when the king asked Heliodorus who might be a fit man to be
sent yet once more to Jerusalem he said

338 If thou hast any enemy or traitor to thy king dom send him
thither and thou shalt receive him again scourged if so be he escape
for there is undoubtedly in that place a certain power of God

339 For he that hath his dwelling in the heavens is the visitor and
protector of that place and he striketh and destroyeth them that come
to do evil to it

340 And the things concerning Heliodorus and the keeping of the
treasury fell out in this manner



2 Machabees Chapter 4


Onias has recourse to the king The ambition and wickedness of Jason
and Menelaus Onias is treacherously murdered

41 But Simon of whom we spoke before who was the betrayer of the
money and of his country spoke ill of Onias as though he had incited
Heliodorus to do these things and had been the promoter of evils

42 And he presumed to call him a traitor to the kingdom who provided
for the city and defended his nation and was zealous for the law of
God

43 But when the enmities proceeded so far that murders also were
committed by some of Simons friends

44 Onias considering the danger of this contention and that
Apollonius who was the governor of Celesyia and Phenicia was
outrageous which increased the malice of Simon went to the king

45 Not to be an accuser of his countrymen but with view to the
common good of all the people

46 For he saw that except the king took care it was impossible that
matters should be settled in peace or that Simon would cease from his
folly

47 But after the death of Seleucus when Antiochus who was called
the Illustrious had taken possession of the kingdom Jason the
brother of Onias ambitiously sought the high priesthood

48 And went to the king promising him three hundred and sixty
talents of silver and out of other revenues fourscore talents

49 Besides this he promised also a hundred and fifty more if he
might have license to set him up a place for exercise and a place for
youth and to entitle them that were at Jerusalem Antiochians

410 Which when the king had granted and he had gotten the rule into
his hands forthwith he began to bring over his countrymen to the
fashion of the heathens

411 And abolishing those things which had been decreed of special
favour by the kings in behalf of the Jews by the means of John the
father of that Eupolemus who went ambassador to Rome to make amity and
alliance he disannulled the lawful ordinances of the citizens and
brought in fashions that were perverse

412 For he had the boldness to set up under the very castle a place
of exercise and to put all the choicest youths in brothel houses

413 Now this was not the beginning but an increase and progress of
heathenish and foreign manners through the abominable and unheard of
wickedness of Jason that impious wretch and no priest

414 Insomuch that the priests were not now occupied about the offices
of the altar but despising the temple and neglecting the sacrifices
hastened to be partakers of the games and of the unlawful allowance
thereof and of the exercise of the discus

415 And setting nought by the honours of their fathers they esteemed
the Grecian glories for the best

416 For the sake of which they incurred a dangerous contention and
followed earnestly their ordinances and in all things they coveted to
be like them who were their enemies and murderers

417 For acting wickedly against the laws of God doth not pass
unpunished but this the time following will declare

418 Now when the game that was used every fifth year was kept at
Tyre the king being present

419 The wicked Jason sent from Jerusalem sinful men to carry three
hundred didrachmas of silver for the sacrifice of Hercules but the
bearers thereof desired it might not be bestowed on the sacrifices
because it was not necessary but might be deputed for other charges

420 So the money was appointed by him that sent it to the sacrifice
of Hercules but because of them that carried it was employed for the
making of galleys

421 Now when Apollonius the son of Mnestheus was sent into Egypt to
treat with the nobles of king Philometor and Antiochus understood that
he was wholly excluded from the affairs of the kingdom consulting his
own interest he departed thence and came to Joppe and from thence to
Jerusalem

422 Where he was received in a magnificent manner by Jason and the
city and came in with torch lights and with praises and from thence
he returned with his army into Phenicia

423 Three years afterwards Jason sent Menelaus brother of the
aforesaid Simon to carry money to the king and to bring answers from
him concerning certain necessary affairs

424 But he being recommended to the king when he had magnified the
appearance of his power got the high priesthood for himself by
offering more than Jason by three hundred talents of silver

425 So having received the kings mandate he returned bringing
nothing worthy of the high priesthood but having the mind of a cruel
tyrant and the rage of a savage beast

426 Then Jason who had undermined his own brother being himself
undermined was driven out a fugitive into the country of the
Ammonites

427 So Menelaus got the principality but as for the money he had
promised to the king he took no care when Sostratus the governor of
the castle called for it

428 For to him appertained the gathering of the taxes wherefore they
were both called before the king

429 And Menelaus was removed from the priesthood Lysimachus his
brother succeeding and Sostratus alas made governor of the Cyprians

430 When these things were in doing it fell out that they of
Tharsus and Mallos raised a sedition because they were given for a
gift to Antiochus the kings concubine

431 The king therefore went in all haste to appease them leaving
Andronicus one of his nobles for his deputy

432 Then Menelaus supposing that he had found a convenient time
having stolen certain vessels of gold out of the temple gave them to
Andronicus and others he had sold at Tyre and in the neighbouring
cities

433 Which when Onias understood most certainly he reproved him
keeping himself in a safe place at Antioch beside Daphne

434 Whereupon Menelaus coming to Andronicus desired him to kill
Onias And he went to Onias and gave him his right hand with an oath
and though he were suspected by him persuaded him to come forth out
of the sanctuary and immediately slew him without any regard to
justice

435 For which cause not only the Jews but also the other nations
conceived indignation and were much grieved for the unjust murder of
so great a man

436 And when the king was come back from the places of Cilicia the
Jews that were at Antioch and also the Greeks went to him
complaining of the unjust murder of Onias

437 Antiochus therefore was grieved in his mind for Onias and
being moved to pity shed tears remembering the sobriety and modesty
of the deceased

438 And being inflamed to anger he commanded Andronicus to be
stripped of his purple and to be led about through all the city and
that in the same place wherein he had committed the impiety against
Onias the sacrilegious wretch should be put to death the Lord
repaying him his deserved punishment

439 Now when many sacrileges had been committed by Lysimachus in the
temple by the counsel of Menelaus and the rumour of it was spread
abroad the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus
a great quantity of gold being already carried away

440 Wherefore the multitude making an insurrection and their minds
being filled with anger Lysimachus armed about three thousand men and
began to use violence one Tyrannus being captain a man far gone both
in age and in madness

441 But when they perceived the attempt of Lysimachus some caught up
stones some strong clubs and some threw ashes upon Lysimachus

442 And many of them were wounded and some struck down to the
ground but all were put to flight and as for the sacrilegious fellow
himself they slew him beside the treasury

443 Now concerning these matters an accusation was laid against
Menelaus

444 And when the king was come to Tyre three men were sent from the
ancients to plead the cause before him

445 But Menelaus being convicted promised Ptolemee to give him much
money to persuade the king to favour him

Ptolemee  The son of Dorymenus a favourite of the king

446 So Ptolemee went to the king in a certain court where he was as
it were to cool himself and brought him to be of another mind

447 So Menelaus who was guilty of all the evil was acquitted by him
of the accusations and those poor men who if they had pleaded their
cause even before Scythians should have been judged innocent were
condemned to death

448 Thus they that persecuted the cause for the city and for the
people and the sacred vessels did soon suffer unjust punishment

449 Wherefore even the Tyrians being moved with indignation were
very liberal towards their burial

450 And so through the covetousness of them that were in power
Menelaus continued in authority increasing in malice to the betraying
of the citizens



2 Machabees Chapter 5


Wonderful signs are seen in the air Jasons wickedness and end
Antiochus takes Jerusalem and plunders the temple

51 At the same time Antiochus prepared for a second journey into
Egypt

52 And it came to pass that through the whole city of Jerusalem for
the space of forty days there were seen horsemen running in the air
in gilded raiment and armed with spears like bands of soldiers

53 And horses set in order by ranks running one against another
with the shakings of shields and a multitude of men in helmets with
drawn swords and casting of darts and glittering of golden armour
and of harnesses of all sorts

54 Wherefore all men prayed that these prodigies might turn to good

55 Now when there was gone forth a false rumour as though Antiochus
had been dead Jason taking with him no fewer than a thousand men
suddenly assaulted the city and though the citizens ran together to
the wall the city at length was taken and Menelaus fled into the
castle

56 But Jason slew his countrymen without mercy not considering that
prosperity against ones own kindred is a very great evil thinking
they had been enemies and not citizens whom he conquered

57 Yet he did not get the principality but received confusion at the
end for the reward of his treachery and fled again into the country
of the Ammonites

58 At the last having been shut up by Aretas the king of the
Arabians in order for his destruction flying from city to city hated
by all men as a forsaker of the laws and execrable as an enemy of his
country and countrymen he was thrust out into Egypt

59 And he that had driven many out of their country perished in a
strange land going to Lacedemon as if for kindred sake he should have
refuge there

510 But he that had cast out many unburied was himself cast forth
both unlamented and unburied neither having foreign burial nor being
partaker of the sepulchre of his fathers

511 Now when these things were done the king suspected that the Jews
would forsake the alliance whereupon departing out of Egypt with a
furious mind he took the city by force of arms

512 And commanded the soldiers to kill and not to spare any that
came in their way and to go up into the houses to slay

513 Thus there was a slaughter of young and old destruction of women
and children and killing of virgins and infants

514 And there were slain in the space of three whole days fourscore
thousand forty thousand were made prisoners and as many sold

515 But this was not enough he presumed also to enter into the
temple the most holy in all the world Menelaus that traitor to the
laws and to his country being his guide

516 And taking in his wicked hands the holy vessels which were given
by other kings and cities for the ornament and the glory of the place
he unworthily handled and profaned them

517 Thus Antiochus going astray in mind did not consider that God
was angry for a while because of the sins of the inhabitants of the
city and therefore this contempt had happened to the place

518 Otherwise had they not been involved in many sins as Heliodorus
who was sent by king Seleucus to rob the treasury so this man also as
soon as he had come had been forthwith scourged and put back from his
presumption

519 But God did not choose the people for the places sake but the
place for the peoples sake

520 And therefore the place also itself was made partaker of the
evils of the people but afterwards shall communicate in the good
things thereof and as it was forsaken in the wrath of Almighty God
shall be exalted again with great glory when the great Lord shall be
reconciled

521 So when Antiochus had taken away out of the temple a thousand and
eight hundred talents he went back in all haste to Antioch thinking
through pride that he might now make the land navigable and the sea
passable on foot such was the haughtiness of his mind

522 He left also governors to afflict the people at Jerusalem
Philip a Phrygian by birth but in manners more barbarous than he that
set him there

523 And in Gazarim Andronicus and Menelaus who bore a more heavy
hand upon the citizens than the rest

524 And whereas he was set against the Jews he sent that hateful
prince Apollonius with an army of two and twenty thousand men
commanding him to kill all that were of perfect age and to sell the
women and the younger sort

525 Who when he was come to Jerusalem pretending peace rested till
the holy day of the sabbath and then the Jews keeping holiday he
commanded his men to take arms

526 And he slew all that were come forth to flee and running through
the city with armed men he destroyed a very great multitude

527 But Judas Machabeus who was the tenth had withdrawn himself
into a desert place and there lived amongst wild beasts in the
mountains with his company and they continued feeding on herbs that
they might not be partakers of the pollution

Was the tenth  That is he had nine others in his company



2 Machabees Chapter 6


Antiochus commands the law to be abolished sets up an idol in the
temple and persecutes the faithful The martyrdom of Eleazar

61 But not long after the king sent a certain old man of Antioch to
compel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers and of God

62 And to defile the temple that was in Jerusalem and to call it the
temple of Jupiter Olympius and that in Garazim of Jupiter Hospitalis
according as they were that inhabited the place

That in Gazarim  Viz the temple of the Samaritans And as they were
originally strangers the name of Hospitalis which signifies of or
belonging to strangers was applicable to the idol set up in their
temple

63 And very bad was this invasion of evils and grievous to all

64 For the temple was full of the riot and revellings of the
Gentiles and of men lying with lewd women And women thrust themselves
of their accord into the holy places and brought in things that were
not lawful

65 The altar also was filled with unlawful things which were
forbidden by the laws

66 And neither were the sabbaths kept nor the solemn days of the
fathers observed neither did any man plainly profess himself to be a
Jew

67 But they were led by bitter constraint on the kings birthday to
the sacrifices and when the feast of Bacchus was kept they were
compelled to go about crowned with ivy in honour of Bacchus

68 And there went out a decree into the neighbouring cities of the
Gentiles by the suggestion of the Ptolemeans that they also should
act in like manner against the Jews to oblige them to sacrifice

69 And whosoever would not conform themselves to the ways of the
Gentiles should be put to death then was misery to be seen

610 For two women were accused to have circumcised their children
whom when they had openly led about through the city with the infants
hanging at their breasts they threw down headlong from the walls

611 And others that had met together in caves that were near and
were keeping the sabbath day privately being discovered by Philip
were burnt with fire because they made a conscience to help themselves
with their hands by reason of the religious observance of the day

Philip  The governor of Jerusalem

612 Now I beseech those that shall read this book that they be not
shocked at these calamities but that they consider the things that
happened not as being for the destruction but for the correction of
our nation

613 For it is a token of great goodness when sinners are not
suffered to go on in their ways for a long time but are presently
punished

614 For not as with other nations whom the Lord patiently
expecteth that when the day of judgment shall come he may punish them
in the fulness of their sins

615 Doth he also deal with us so as to suffer our sins to come to
their height and then take vengeance on us

616 And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us but though
he chastise his people with adversity he forsaketh them not

617 But let this suffice in a few words for a warning to the readers
And now we must come to the narration

618 Eleazar one of the chief of the scribes a man advanced in years
and of a comely countenance was pressed to open his mouth to eat
swines flesh

619 But he choosing rather a most glorious death than a hateful
life went forward voluntarily to the torment

620 And considering in what manner he was to come to it patiently
bearing he determined not to do any unlawful things for the love of
life

621 But they that stood by being moved with wicked pity for the old
friendship they had with the man taking him aside desired that flesh
might be brought which it was lawful for him to eat that he might make
as if he had eaten as the king had commanded of the flesh of the
sacrifice

Wicked pity  Their pity was wicked inasmuch as it suggested that
wicked proposal of saving his life by dissimulation

622 That by so doing he might be delivered from death and for the
sake of their old friendship with the man they did him this courtesy

623 But he began to consider the dignity of his age and his ancient
years and the inbred honour of his grey head and his good life and
conversation from a child and he answered without delay according to
the ordinances of the holy law made by God saying that he would
rather be sent into the other world

624 For it doth not become our age said he to dissemble whereby
many young persons might think that Eleazar at the age of fourscore
and ten years was gone over to the life of the heathens

625 And so they through my dissimulation and for a little time of a
corruptible life should be deceived and hereby I should bring a stain
and a curse upon my old age

626 For though for the present time I should be delivered from the
punishments of men yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty
neither alive nor dead

627 Wherefore by departing manfully out of this life I shall shew
myself worthy of my old age

628 And I shall leave an example of fortitude to young men if with a
ready mind and constancy I suffer an honourable death for the most
venerable and most holy laws And having spoken thus he was forthwith
carried to execution

629 And they that led him and had been a little before more mild
were changed to wrath for the words he had spoken which they thought
were uttered out of arrogancy

630 But when be was now ready to die with the stripes he groaned
and said O Lord who hast the holy knowledge thou knowest manifestly
that whereas I might be delivered from death I suffer grievous pains
in body but in soul am well content to suffer these things because I
fear thee

631 Thus did this man die leaving not only to young men but also to
the whole nation the memory of his death for an example of virtue and
fortitude



2 Machabees Chapter 7


The glorious martyrdom of the seven brethren and their mother

71 It came to pass also that seven brethren together with their
mother were apprehended and compelled by the king to eat swines
flesh against the law for which end they were tormented with whips and
scourges

72 But one of them who was the eldest said thus What wouldst thou
ask or learn of us we are ready to die rather than to transgress the
laws of God received from our fathers

73 Then the king being angry commanded fryingpans and brazen
caldrons to be made hot which forthwith being heated

74 He commanded to cut out the tongue of him that had spoken first
and the skin of his head being drawn off to chop off also the
extremities of his hands and feet the rest of his brethren and his
mother looking on

76 And when he was now maimed in all parts he commanded him being
yet alive to be brought to the fire and to be fried in the fryingpan
and while he was suffering therein long torments the rest together
with the mother exhorted one another to die manfully

76 Saying The Lord God will look upon the truth and will take
pleasure in us as Moses declared in the profession of the canticle
And in his servants he will take pleasure

77 So when the first was dead after this manner they brought the
next to make him a mocking stock and when they had pulled off the skin
of his head with the hair they asked him if he would eat before he
were punished throughout the whole body in every limb

78 But he answered in his own language and said I will not do it
Wherefore he also in the next place received the torments of the first

79 And when he was at the last gasp he said thus Thou indeed O
most wicked man destroyest us out of this present life but the King
of the world will raise us up who die for his laws in the
resurrection of eternal life

710 After him the third was made a mockingstock and when he was
required he quickly put forth his tongue and courageously stretched
out his hands

711 And said with confidence These I have from heaven but for the
laws of God I now despise them because I hope to receive them again
from him

712 So that the king and they that were with him wondered at the
young mans courage because he esteemed the torments as nothing

713 And after he was thus dead they tormented the fourth in the like
manner

714 And when he was now ready to die he spoke thus It is better
being put to death by men to look for hope from God to be raised up
again by him for as to thee thou shalt have no resurrection unto
life

715 And when they had brought the fifth they tormented him But he
looking upon the king

716 Said Whereas thou hast power among men though thou art
corruptible thou dost what thou wilt but think not that our nation is
forsaken by God

717 But stay patiently a while and thou shalt see his great power
in what manner he will torment thee and thy seed

718 After him they brought the sixth and he being ready to die
spoke thus Be not deceived without cause for we suffer these things
for ourselves having sinned against our God and things worthy of
admiration are done to us

719 But do not think that thou shalt escape unpunished for that thou
hast attempted to fight against God

720 Now the mother was to be admired above measure and worthy to be
remembered by good men who beheld her seven sons slain in the space of
one day and bore it with a good courage for the hope that she had in
God

721 And she bravely exhorted every one of them in her own language
being filled with wisdom and joining a mans heart to a womans
thought

722 She said to them I know not how you were formed in my womb for
I neither gave you breath nor soul nor life neither did I frame the
limbs of every one of you

723 But the Creator of the world that formed the nativity of man
and that found out the origin of all he will restore to you again in
his mercy both breath and life as now you despise yourselves for the
sake of his laws

724 Now Antiochus thinking himself despised and withal despising
the voice of the upbraider when the youngest was yet alive did not
only exhort him by words but also assured him with an oath that he
would make him a rich and a happy man and if he would turn from the
laws of his fathers would take him for a friend and furnish him with
things necessary

725 But when the young man was not moved with these things the king
called the mother and counselled her to deal with the young man to
save his life

726 And when he had exhorted her with many words she promised that
she would counsel her son

727 So bending herself towards him mocking the cruel tyrant she
said in her own language My son have pity upon me that bore thee nine
months in my womb and gave thee suck three years and nourished thee
and brought thee up unto this age

728 I beseech thee my son look upon heaven and earth and all that
is in them and consider that God made them out of nothing and mankind
also

729 So thou shalt not fear this tormentor but being made a worthy
partner with thy brethren receive death that in that mercy I may
receive thee again with thy brethren

730 While she was yet speaking these words the young man said For
whom do you stay I will not obey the commandment of the king but the
commandment of the law which was given us by Moses

731 But thou that hast been the author of all mischief against the
Hebrews shalt not escape the hand of God

732 For we suffer thus for our sins

733 And though the Lord our God is angry with us a little while
for our chastisement and correction yet he will be reconciled again to
his servants

734 But thou O wicked and of all men most flagitious be not lifted
up without cause with vain hopes whilst thou art raging against his
servants

735 For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of the Almighty God
who beholdeth all things

736 For my brethren having now undergone a short pain are under the
covenant of eternal life but thou by the judgment of God shalt
receive just punishment for thy pride

737 But I like my brethren offer up my life and my body for the
laws of our fathers calling upon God to be speedily merciful to our
nation and that thou by torments and stripes mayst confess that he
alone is God

738 But in me and in my brethren the wrath of the Almighty which
hath justly been brought upon all our nation shall cease

739 Then the king being incensed with anger raged against him more
cruelly than all the rest taking it grievously that he was mocked

740 So this man also died undefiled wholly trusting in the Lord

741 And last of all after the sons the mother also was consumed

742 But now there is enough said of the sacrifices and of the
excessive cruelties



2 Machabees Chapter 8


Judas Machabeus gathering an army gains divers victories

81 But Judas Machabeus and they that were with him went privately
into the towns and calling together their kinsmen and friends and
taking unto them such as continued in the Jews religion they
assembled six thousand men

82 And they called upon the Lord that he would look upon his people
that was trodden down by all and would have pity on the temple that
was defiled by the wicked

83 That he would have pity also upon the city that was destroyed
that was ready to be made even with the ground and would hear the
voice of the blood that cried to him

84 That he would remember also the most unjust deaths of innocent
children and the blasphemies offered to his name and would shew his
indignation on this occasion

85 Now when Machabeus had gathered a multitude he could not be
withstood by the heathens for the wrath of the Lord was turned into
mercy

86 So coming unawares upon the towns and cities he set them on fire
and taking possession of the most commodious places he made no small
slaughter of the enemies

87 And especially in the nights he went upon these expeditions and
the fame of his valour was spread abroad every where

88 Then Philip seeing that the man gained ground by little and
little and that things for the most part succeeded prosperously with
him wrote to Ptolemee the governor of Celesyria and Phenicia to send
aid to the kings affairs

Philip seeing etc  The governor of Jerusalem found himself unable to
contend with Judas especially after the victories he had obtained over
Apollonius and Seron 1 Mac 3

89 And he with all speed sent Nicanor the son of Patroclus one of
his special friends giving him no fewer than twenty thousand armed men
of different nations to root out the whole race of the Jews joining
also with him Gorgias a good soldier and of great experience in
matters of war

Twenty thousand  The whole number of the forces sent at that time
into Judea was 40000 footmen and 7000 horsemen 1 Mac 330 But
only 20000 are here taken notice of because there were no more with
Nicanor at the time of the battle

810 And Nicanor purposed to raise for the king the tribute of two
thousand talents that was to be given to the Romans by making so much
money of the captive Jews

811 Wherefore he sent immediately to the cities upon the sea coast
to invite men together to buy up the Jewish slaves promising that they
should have ninety slaves for one talent not reflecting on the
vengeance which was to follow him from the Almighty

812 Now when Judas found that Nicanor was coming he imparted to the
Jews that were with him that the enemy was at hand

813 And some of them being afraid and distrusting the justice of
God fled away

814 Others sold all that they had left and withal besought the Lord
that he would deliver them from the wicked Nicanor who had sold them
before he came near them

815 And if not for their sakes yet for the covenant that he had made
with their fathers and for the sake of his holy and glorious name that
was invoked upon them

816 But Machabeus calling together seven thousand that were with him
exhorted them not to be reconciled to the enemies nor to fear the
multitude of the enemies who came wrongfully against them but to fight
manfully

Seven thousand  In the Greek it is six thousand But then three
thousand of them had no arms 1 Mac 46

817 Setting before their eyes the injury they had unjustly done the
holy place and also the injury they had done to the city which had
been shamefully abused besides their destroying the ordinances of the
fathers

818 For said he they trust in their weapons and in their boldness
but we trust in the Almighty Lord who at a beck can utterly destroy
both them that come against us and the whole world

819 Moreover he put them in mind also of the helps their fathers had
received from God and how under Sennacherib a hundred and
eightyfive thousand had been destroyed

820 And of the battle that they had fought against the Galatians in
Babylonia how they being in all but six thousand when it came to the
point and the Macedonians their companions were at a stand slew a
hundred and twenty thousand because of the help they had from heaven
and for this they received many favours

Galatians  That is the Gauls who having ravaged Italy and Greece
poured themselves in upon Asia in immense multitudes where also they
founded the kingdom of Galatia or Gallo Graecia

821 With these words they were greatly encouraged and disposed even
to die for the laws and their country

822 So he appointed his brethren captains over each division of his
army Simon and Joseph and Jonathan giving to each one fifteen
hundred men

823 And after the holy book had been read to them by Esdras and he
had given them for a watchword The help of God himself leading the
first band he joined battle with Nicanor

824 And the Almighty being their helper they slew above nine
thousand men and having wounded and disabled the greater part of
Nicanors army they obliged them to fly

Above nine thousand  Viz including the three thousand slain in the
pursuit

825 And they took the money of them that came to buy them and they
pursued them on every side

826 But they came back for want of time for it was the day before
the sabbath and therefore they did not continue the pursuit

827 But when they had gathered together their arms and their spoils
they kept the sabbath blessing the Lord who had delivered them that
day distilling the beginning of mercy upon them

828 Then after the sabbath they divided the spoils to the feeble and
the orphans and the widows and the rest they took for themselves and
their servants

829 When this was done and they had all made a common supplication
they besought the merciful Lord to be reconciled to his servants unto
the end

830 Moreover they slew above twenty thousand of them that were with
Timotheus and Bacchides who fought against them and they made
themselves masters of the high strong holds and they divided amongst
them many spoils giving equal portions to the feeble the fatherless
and the widows yea and the aged also

831 And when they had carefully gathered together their arms they
laid them all up in convenient places and the residue of their spoils
they carried to Jerusalem

832 They slew also Philarches who was with Timotheus a wicked man
who had many ways afflicted the Jews

833 And when they kept the feast of the victory at Jerusalem they
burnt Callisthenes that had set fire to the holy gates who had taken
refuge in a certain house rendering to him a worthy reward for his
impieties

834 But as for that most wicked man Nicanor who had brought a
thousand merchants to the sale of the Jews

835 Being through the help of the Lord brought down by them of
whom he had made no account laying aside his garment of glory fleeing
through the midland country he came alone to Antioch being rendered
very unhappy by the destruction of his army

Laying aside his garment of glory  That is his splendid apparel
which he wore through ostentation he now throws it off lest he should
be known on his flight

836 And he that had promised to levy the tribute for the Romans by
the means of the captives of Jerusalem now professed that the Jews had
God for their protector and therefore they could not be hurt because
they followed the laws appointed by him



2 Machabees Chapter 9


The wretched end and fruitless repentance of king Antiochus

91 At that time Antiochus returned with dishonour out of Persia

92 For he had entered into the city called Persepolis and attempted
to rob the temple and to oppress the city but the multitude running
together to arms put them to flight and so it fell out that Antiochus
being put to flight returned with disgrace

Persepolis  Otherwise called Elymais

93 Now when he was come about Ecbatana he received the news of what
had happened to Nicanor and Timotheus

94 And swelling with anger he thought to revenge upon the Jews the
injury done by them that had put him to flight And therefore he
commanded his chariot to be driven without stopping in his journey
the judgment of heaven urging him forward because he had spoken so
proudly that he would come to Jerusalem and make it a common burying
place of the Jews

95 But the Lord the God of Israel that seeth all things struck him
with an incurable and an invisible plague For as soon as he had ended
these words a dreadful pain in his bowels came upon him and bitter
torments of the inner parts

96 And indeed very justly seeing he had tormented the bowels of
others with many and new torments albeit he by no means ceased from
his malice

97 Moreover being filled with pride breathing out fire in his rage
against the Jews and commanding the matter to be hastened it happened
as he was going with violence that he fell from the chariot so that
his limbs were much pained by a grievous bruising of the body

98 Thus he that seemed to himself to command even the waves of the
sea being proud above the condition of man and to weigh the heights
of the mountains in a balance now being cast down to the ground was
carried in a litter bearing witness to the manifest power of God in
himself

99 So that worms swarmed out of the body of this man and whilst he
lived in sorrow and pain his flesh fell off and the filthiness of his
smell was noisome to the army

910 And the man that thought a little before he could reach to the
stars of heaven no man could endure to carry for the intolerable
stench

911 And by this means being brought from his great pride he began
to come to the knowledge of himself being admonished by the scourge of
God his pains increasing every moment

912 And when he himself could not now abide his own stench he spoke
thus It is just to be subject to God and that a mortal man should not
equal himself to God

913 Then this wicked man prayed to the Lord of whom he was not like
to obtain mercy

Of whom he was not like to obtain mercy  Because his repentance was
not for the offence committed against God but barely on account of his
present sufferings

914 And the city to which he was going in haste to lay it even with
the ground and to make it a common burying place he now desireth to
make free

915 And the Jews whom he said he would not account worthy to be so
much as buried but would give them up to be devoured by the birds and
wild beasts and would utterly destroy them with their children he now
promiseth to make equal with the Athenians

916 The holy temple also which before he had spoiled he promised to
adorn with goodly gifts and to multiply the holy vessels and to allow
out of his revenues the charges pertaining to the sacrifices

917 Yea also that he would become a Jew himself and would go
through every place of the earth and declare the power of God

918 But his pains not ceasing for the just judgment of God was come
upon him despairing of life he wrote to the Jews in the manner of a
supplication a letter in these words

919 To his very good subjects the Jews Antiochus king and ruler
wisheth much health and welfare and happiness

920 If you and your children are well and if all matters go with you
to your mind we give very great thanks

921 As for me being infirm but yet kindly remembering you
returning out of the places of Persia and being taken with a grievous
disease I thought it necessary to take care for the common good

922 Not distrusting my life but having great hope to escape the
sickness

923 But considering that my father also at what time he led an army
into the higher countries appointed who should reign after him

924 To the end that if any thing contrary to expectation should fall
out or any bad tidings should be brought they that were in the
countries knowing to whom the whole government was left might not be
troubled

925 Moreover considering that neighbouring princes and borderers
wait for opportunities and expect what shall be the event I have
appointed my son Antiochus king whom I often recommended to many of
you when I went into the higher provinces and I have written to him
what I have joined here below

926 I pray you therefore and request of you that remembering
favours both public and private you will every man of you continue to
be faithful to me and to my son

927 For I trust that he will behave with moderation and humanity and
following my intentions will be gracious unto you

928 Thus the murderer and blasphemer being grievously struck as
himself had treated others died a miserable death in a strange
country among the mountains

929 But Philip that was brought up with him carried away his body
and out of fear of the son of Antiochus went into Egypt to Ptolemee
Philometor



2 Machabees Chapter 10


The purification of the temple and city Other exploits of Judas His
victory over Timotheus

101 But Machabeus and they that were with him by the protection of
the Lord recovered the temple and the city again

102 But he threw down the altars which the heathens had set up in the
streets as also the temples of the idols

103 And having purified the temple they made another altar and
taking fire out of the fiery stones they offered sacrifices after two
years and set forth incense and lamps and the loaves of proposition

104 And when they had done these things they besought the Lord
lying prostrate on the ground that they might no more fall into such
evils but if they should at any time sin that they might be chastised
by him more gently and not be delivered up to barbarians and
blasphemous men

105 Now upon the same day that the temple had been polluted by the
strangers on the very same day it was cleansed again to wit on the
five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu

106 And they kept eight days with joy after the manner of the feast
of the tabernacles remembering that not long before they had kept the
feast of the tabernacles when they were in the mountains and in dens
like wild beasts

107 Therefore they now carried boughs and green branches and palms
for him that had given them good success in cleansing his place

108 And they ordained by a common statute and decree that all the
nation of the Jews should keep those days every year

109 And this was the end of Antiochus that was called the
Illustrious

1010 But now we will repeat the acts of Eupator the son of that
wicked Antiochus abridging the account of the evils that happened in
the wars

1011 For when he was come to the crown he appointed over the affairs
of his realm one Lysias general of the army of Phenicia and Syria

1012 For Ptolemee that was called Macer was determined to be
strictly just to the Jews and especially by reason of the wrong that
had been done them and to deal peaceably with them

1013 But being accused for this to Eupator by his friends and being
oftentimes called traitor because he had left Cyprus which Philometor
had committed to him and coming over to Antiochus the Illustrious had
revolted also from him he put an end to his life by poison

1014 But Gorgias who was governor of the holds taking with him the
strangers often fought against the Jews

1015 And the Jews that occupied the most commodious holds received
those that were driven out of Jerusalem and attempted to make war

The Jews etc  He speaks of them that had fallen from their religion
and were enemies of their country who joining with the Idumeans or
Edomites kept possession of the strong holds and from thence annoyed
their countrymen

1016 Then they that were with Machabeus beseeching the Lord by
prayers to be their helper made a strong attack upon the strong holds
of the Idumeans

1017 And assaulting them with great force won the holds killed them
that came in the way and slew altogether no fewer than twenty
thousand

1018 And whereas some were fled into very strong towers having all
manner of provision to sustain a siege

1019 Machabeus left Simon and Joseph and Zacheus and them that were
with them in sufficient number to besiege them and departed to those
expeditions which urged more

1020 Now they that were with Simon being led with covetousness were
persuaded for the sake of money by some that were in the towers and
taking seventy thousand didrachmas let some of them escape

1021 But when it was told Machabeus what was done he assembled the
rulers of the people and accused those men that they had sold their
brethren for money having let their adversaries escape

1022 So he put these traitors to death and forthwith took the two
towers

1023 And having good success in arms and all things he took in hand
he slew more than twenty thousand in the two holds

1024 But Timotheus who before had been overcome by the Jews having
called together a multitude of foreign troops and assembled horsemen
out of Asia came as though he would take Judea by force of arms

1026 But Machabeus and they that were with him when he drew near
prayed to the Lord sprinkling earth upon their heads and girding
their loins with haircloth

1026 And lying prostrate at the foot of the altar besought him to be
merciful to them and to be an enemy to their enemies and an adversary
to their adversaries as the law saith

1027 And so after prayer taking their arms they went forth further
from the city and when they were come very near the enemies they
rested

1028 But as soon as the sun was risen both sides joined battle the
one part having with their valour the Lord for a surety of victory
and success but the other side making their rage their leader in
battle

1029 But when they were in the heat of the engagement there appeared
to the enemies from heaven five men upon horses comely with golden
bridles conducting the Jews

1030 Two of them took Machabeus between them and covered him on
every side with their arms and kept him safe but cast darts and
fireballs against the enemy so that they fell down being both
confounded with blindness and filled with trouble

1031 And there were slain twenty thousand five hundred and six
hundred horsemen

1032 But Timotheus fled into Gazara a strong hold where Chereas was
governor

1033 Then Machabeus and they that were with him cheerfully laid
siege to the fortress four days

1034 But they that were within trusting to the strength of the
place blasphemed exceedingly and cast forth abominable words

1035 But when the fifth day appeared twenty young men of them that
were with Machabeus inflamed in their minds because of the blasphemy
approached manfully to the wall and pushing forward with fierce
courage got up upon it

1036 Moreover others also getting up after them went to set fire to
the towers and the gates and to burn the blasphemers alive

1037 And having for two days together pillaged and sacked the
fortress they killed Timotheus who was found hid in a certain place
they slew also his brother Chereas and Apollophanes

Timotheus  This man who was killed at the taking of Gazara is
different from that Timotheus who is mentioned in the fifth chapter of
the first book of Machabees and of whom there is mention in the
following chapter

1038 And when this was done they blessed the Lord with hymns and
thanksgiving who had done great things in Israel and given them the
victory



2 Machabees Chapter 11


Lysias is overthrown by Judas He sues for peace

111 A short time after this Lysias the kings lieutenant and
cousin and who had chief charge over all the affairs being greatly
displeased with what had happened

112 Gathered together fourscore thousand men and all the horsemen
and came against the Jews thinking to take the city and make it a
habitation of the Gentiles

113 And to make a gain of the temple as of the other temples of the
Gentiles and to set the high priesthood to sale every year

114 Never considering the power of God but puffed up in mind and
trusting in the multitude of his foot soldiers and the thousands of
his horsemen and his fourscore elephants

115 So he came into Judea and approaching to Bethsura which was in
a narrow place the space of five furlongs from Jerusalem he laid
siege to that fortress

116 But when Machabeus and they that were with him understood that
the strong holds were besieged they and all the people besought the
Lord with lamentations and tears that he would send a good angel to
save Israel

117 Then Machabeus himself first taking his arms exhorted the rest
to expose themselves together with him to the danger and to succour
their brethren

118 And when they were going forth together with a willing mind
there appeared at Jerusalem a horseman going before them in white
clothing with golden armour shaking a spear

119 Then they all together blessed the merciful Lord and took great
courage being ready to break through not only men but also the
fiercest beasts and walls of iron

1110 So they went on courageously having a helper from heaven and
the Lord who shewed mercy to them

1111 And rushing violently upon the enemy like lions they slew of
them eleven thousand footmen and one thousand six hundred horsemen

1112 And put all the rest to flight and many of them being wounded
escaped naked Yea and Lysias himself fled away shamefully and
escaped

1113 And as he was a man of understanding considering with himself
the loss he had suffered and perceiving that the Hebrews could not be
overcome because they relied upon the help of the Almighty God he
sent to them

1114 And promised that he would agree to all things that are just
and that he would persuade the king to be their friend

1115 Then Machabeus consented to the request of Lysias providing for
the common good in all things and whatsoever Machabeus wrote to
Lysias concerning the Jews the king allowed of

1116 For there were letters written to the Jews from Lysias to this
effect Lysias to the people of the Jews greeting

1117 John and Abesalom who were sent from you delivering your
writings requested that I would accomplish those things which were
signified by them

1118 Therefore whatsoever things could be reported to the king
I have represented to him and he hath granted as much as the matter
permitted

1119 If therefore you will keep yourselves loyal in affairs
hereafter also I will endeavour to be a means of your good

1120 But as concerning other particulars I have given orders by word
both to these and to them that are sent by me to commune with you

1121 Fare ye well In the year one hundred and fortyeight the four
and twentieth day of the month of Dioscorus

In the year 148  Viz according to the computation followed by the
Greeks which was different from that of the Hebrews followed by the
writer of the first book of Machabees However by this date as well
as by other circumstances it appears that the expedition of Lysias
mentioned in this chapter is different from that which is recorded
1 Mac 6

1122 But the kings letter contained these words King Antiochus to
Lysias his brother greeting

1123 Our father being translated amongst the gods we are desirous
that they that are in our realm should live quietly and apply
themselves diligently to their own concerns

1124 And we have heard that the Jews would not consent to my father
to turn to the rites of the Greeks but that they would keep to their
own manner of living and therefore that they request us to allow them
to live after their own laws

1125 Wherefore being desirous that this nation also should be at
rest we have ordained and decreed that the temple should be restored
to them and that they may live according to the custom of their
ancestors

1126 Thou shalt do well therefore to send to them and grant them
peace that our pleasure being known they may be of good comfort and
look to their own affairs

1127 But the kings letter to the Jews was in this manner King
Antiochus to the senate of the Jews and to the rest of the Jews
greeting

1128 If you are well you are as we desire we ourselves also are
well

1129 Menelaus came to us saying that you desired to come down to
your countrymen that are with us

1130 We grant therefore a safe conduct to all that come and go
until the thirtieth day of the month of Xanthicus

1131 That the Jews may use their own kind of meats and their own
laws as before and that none of them any manner of ways be molested
for things which have been done by ignorance

1132 And we have sent also Menelaus to speak to you

1133 Fare ye well In the year one hundred and fortyeight the
fifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus

1134 The Romans also sent them a letter to this effect Quintus
Memmius and Titus Manilius ambassadors of the Romans to the people
of the Jews greeting

1135 Whatsoever Lysias the kings cousin hath granted to you we
also have granted

1136 But touching such things as he thought should be referred to the
king after you have diligently conferred among yourselves send some
one forthwith that we may decree as it is convenient for you for we
are going to Antioch

1137 And therefore make haste to write back that we may know of what
mind you are

1138 Fare ye well In the year one hundred and fortyeight the
fifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus



2 Machabees Chapter 12


The Jews are still molested by their neighbours Judas gains divers
victories over them He orders sacrifice and prayers for the dead

121 When these covenants were made Lysias went to the king and the
Jews gave themselves to husbandry

122 But they that were behind viz Timotheus and Apollonius the
son of Genneus also Hieronymus and Demophon and besides them
Nicanor the governor of Cyprus would not suffer them to live in
peace and to be quiet

123 The men of Joppe also were guilty of this kind of wickedness
they desired the Jews who dwelt among them to go with their wives and
children into the boats which they had prepared as though they had no
enmity to them

124 Which when they had consented to according to the common decree
of the city suspecting nothing because of the peace when they were
gone forth into the deep they drowned no fewer than two hundred of
them

125 But as soon as Judas heard of this cruelty done to his
countrymen he commanded the men that were with him and after having
called upon God the just judge

126 He came against those murderers of his brethren and set the
haven on fire in the night burnt the boats and slew with the sword
them that escaped from the fire

127 And when he had done these things in this manner he departed as
if he would return again and root out all the Joppites

128 But when he understood that the men of Jamnia also designed to do
in like manner to the Jews that dwelt among them

129 He came upon the Jamnites also by night and set the haven on
fire with the ships so that the light of the fire was seen at
Jerusalem two hundred and forty furlongs off

1210 And when they were now gone from thence nine furlongs and were
marching towards Timotheus five thousand footmen and five hundred
horsemen of the Arabians set upon them

1211 And after a hard fight in which by the help of God they got
the victory the rest of the Arabians being overcome besought Judas
for peace promising to give him pastures and to assist him in other
things

1212 And Judas thinking that they might be profitable indeed in many
things promised them peace and after having joined hands they
departed to their tents

1213 He also laid siege to a certain strong city encompassed with
bridges and walls and inhabited by multitudes of different nations
the name of which is Casphin

1214 But they that were within it trusting in the strength of the
walls and the provision of victuals behaved in a more negligent
manner and provoked Judas with railing and blaspheming and uttering
such words as were not to be spoken

1215 But Machabeus calling upon the great Lord of the world who
without any rams or engines of war threw down the walls of Jericho in
the time of Josue fiercely assaulted the walls

Rams  That is engines for battering walls etc which were used in
sieges in those times

1216 And having taken the city by the will of the Lord he made an
unspeakable slaughter so that a pool adjoining of two furlongs broad
seemed to run with the blood of the slain

1217 From thence they departed seven hundred and fifty furlongs and
came to Characa to the Jews that are called Tubianites

1218 But as for Timotheus they found him not in those places for
before he had dispatched any thing he went back having left a very
strong garrison in a certain hold

1219 But Dositheus and Sosipater who were captains with Machabeus
slew them that were left by Timotheus in the hold to the number of ten
thousand men

1220 And Machabeus having set in order about him six thousand men
and divided them by bands went forth against Timotheus who had with
him a hundred and twenty thousand footmen and two thousand five
hundred horsemen

1221 Now when Timotheus had knowledge of the coming of Judas he sent
the women and children and the other baggage before him into a
fortress called Carnion for it was impregnable and hard to come at
by reason of the straitness of the places

1222 But when the first band of Judas came in sight the enemies were
struck with fear by the presence of God who seeth all things and
they were put to flight one from another so that they were often
thrown down by their own companions and wounded with the strokes of
their own swords

1223 But Judas pursued them close punishing the profane of whom he
slew thirty thousand men

1224 And Timotheus himself fell into the hands of the band of
Dositheus and Sosipater and with many prayers he besought them to let
him go with his life because he had the parents and brethren of many
of the Jews who by his death might happen to be deceived

1225 And when he had given his faith that he would restore them
according to the agreement they let him go without hurt for the
saving of their brethren

1226 Then Judas went away to Carnion where he slew five and twenty
thousand persons

1227 And after he had put to flight and destroyed these he removed
his army to Ephron a strong city wherein there dwelt a multitude of
divers nations and stout young men standing upon the walls made a
vigorous resistance and in this place there were many engines of war
and a provision of darts

1228 But when they had invocated the Almighty who with his power
breaketh the strength of the enemies they took the city and slew five
and twenty thousand of them that were within

1229 From thence they departed to Scythopolis which lieth six
hundred furlongs from Jerusalem

Scythopolis  Formerly called Bethsan

1230 But the Jews that were among the Scythopolitans testifying that
they were used kindly by them and that even in the times of their
adversity they had treated them with humanity

1231 They gave them thanks exhorting them to be still friendly to
their nation and so they came to Jerusalem the feast of the weeks
being at hand

1232 And after Pentecost they marched against Gorgias the governor
of Idumea

1233 And he came out with three thousand footmen and four hundred
horsemen

1234 And when they had joined battle it happened that a few of the
Jews were slain

1235 But Dositheus a horseman one of Bacenors band a valiant man
took hold of Gorgias and when he would have taken him alive a certain
horseman of the Thracians came upon him and cut off his shoulder and
so Gorgias escaped to Maresa

1236 But when they that were with Esdrin had fought long and were
weary Judas called upon the Lord to be their helper and leader of the
battle

1237 Then beginning in his own language and singing hymns with a
loud voice he put Gorgiass soldiers to flight

1238 So Judas having gathered together his army came into the city
Odollam and when the seventh day came they purified themselves
according to the custom and kept the sabbath in the same place

1239 And the day following Judas came with his company to take away
the bodies of them that were slain and to bury them with their
kinsmen in the sepulchres of their fathers

1240 And they found under the coats of the slain some of the
donaries of the idols of Jamnia which the law forbiddeth to the Jews
so that all plainly saw that for this cause they were slain

Of the donaries etc  That is of the votive offerings which had
been hung up in the temples of the idols which they had taken away
when they burnt the port of Jamnia ver 9 contrary to the
prohibition of the law Deut 725

1241 Then they all blessed the just judgment of the Lord who had
discovered the things that were hidden

1242 And so betaking themselves to prayers they besought him that
the sin which had been committed might be forgotten But the most
valiant Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin
forasmuch as they saw before their eyes what had happened because of
the sins of those that were slain

1243 And making a gathering he sent twelve thousand drachms of
silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the
dead thinking well and religiously concerning the resurrection

1244 For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should rise
again it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead

1245 And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with
godliness had great grace laid up for them

With godliness  Judas hoped that these men who died fighting for the
cause of God and religion might find mercy either because they might
be excused from mortal sin by ignorance or might have repented of
their sin at least at their death

1246 It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the
dead that they may be loosed from sins

It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the
dead  Here is an evident and undeniable proof of the practice of
praying for the dead under the old law which was then strictly observed
by the Jews and consequently could not be introduced at that time by
Judas their chief and high priest if it had not been always their
custom



2 Machabees Chapter 13


Antiochus and Lysias again invade Judea Menelaus is put to death The
kings great army is worsted twice The peace is renewed

131 In the year one hundred and fortynine Judas understood that
Antiochus Eupator was coming with a multitude against Judea

132 And with him Lysias the regent who had charge over the affairs
of the realm having with him a hundred and ten thousand footmen five
thousand horsemen twentytwo elephants and three hundred chariots

A hundred and ten thousand etc  The difference between the numbers
here set down and those recorded 1 Mac 4 is easily accounted for
if we consider that such armies as these are liable to be at one time
more numerous than at another either by sending away large
detachments or being diminished by sickness or increased by receiving
fresh supplies of troops according to different exigencies or
occurrences

133 Menelaus also joined himself with them and with great
deceitfulness besought Antiochus not for the welfare of his country
but in hopes that he should be appointed chief ruler

134 But the King of kings stirred up the mind of Antiochus against
the sinner and upon Lysias suggesting that he was the cause of all the
evils he commanded as the custom is with them that he should be
apprehended and put to death in the same place

135 Now there was in that place a tower fifty cubits high having a
heap of ashes on every side this had a prospect steep down

136 From thence he commanded the sacrilegious wretch to be thrown
down into the ashes all men thrusting him forward unto death

137 And by such a law it happened that Menelaus the transgressor of
the law was put to death not having so much as burial in the earth

138 And indeed very justly for insomuch as he had committed many
sins against the altar of God the fire and ashes of which were holy
he was condemned to die in ashes

139 But the king with his mind full of rage came on to shew himself
worse to the Jews than his father was

1310 Which when Judas understood he commanded the people to call
upon the Lord day and night that as he had always done so now also he
would help them

1311 Because they were afraid to be deprived of the law and of their
country and of the holy temple and that he would not suffer the
people that had of late taken breath for a little while to be again
in subjection to blasphemous nations

1312 So when they had all done this together and had craved mercy of
the Lord with weeping and fasting lying prostrate on the ground for
three days continually Judas exhorted them to make themselves ready

1313 But he with the ancients determined before the king should
bring his army into Judea and make himself master of the city to go
out and to commit the event of the thing to the judgment of the Lord

1314 So committing all to God the Creator of the world and having
exhorted his people to fight manfully and to stand up even to death
for the laws the temple the city their country and citizens he
placed his army about Modin

1315 And having given his company for a watchword The victory of
God with most valiant chosen young men he set upon the kings quarter
by night and slew four thousand men in the camp and the greatest of
the elephants with them that had been upon him

1316 And having filled the camp of the enemies with exceeding great
fear and tumult they went off with good success

1317 Now this was done at the break of day by the protection and
help of the Lord

1318 But the king having taken a taste of the hardiness of the Jews
attempted to take the strong places by policy

1319 And he marched with his army to Bethsura which was a strong
hold of the Jews but he was repulsed he failed he lost his men

1320 Now Judas sent necessaries to them that were within

1321 But Rhodocus one of the Jews army disclosed the secrets to
the enemies so he was sought out and taken up and put in prison

1322 Again the king treated with them that were in Bethsura gave his
right hand took theirs and went away

1323 He fought with Judas and was overcome And when he understood
that Philip who had been left over the affairs had rebelled at
Antioch he was in a consternation of mind and entreating the Jews
and yielding to them he swore to all things that seemed reasonable
and being reconciled offered sacrifice honoured the temple and left
gifts

1324 He embraced Machabeus and made him governor and prince from
Ptolemais unto the Gerrenians

1325 But when he was come to Ptolemais the men of that city were
much displeased with the conditions of the peace being angry for fear
they should break the covenant

1326 Then Lysias went up to the judgment seat and set forth the
reason and appeased the people and returned to Antioch and thus
matters went with regard to the kings coming and his return



2 Machabees Chapter 14


Demetrius challenges the kingdom Alcimus applies to him to be made
high priest Nicanor is sent into Judea his dealings with Judas his
threats The history of Razias

141 But after the space of three years Judas and they that were with
him understood that Demetrius the son of Seleucus was come up with a
great power and a navy by the haven of Tripolis to places proper for
his purpose

142 And had made himself master of the countries against Antiochus
and his general Lysias

143 Now one Alcimus who had been chief priest but had wilfully
defiled himself in the time of mingling with the heathens seeing that
there was no safety for him nor access to the altar

Now Alcimus who had been chief priest  This Alcimus was of the stock
of Aaron but for his apostasy here mentioned was incapable of the high
priesthood but king Antiochus Eupator appointed him in place of the
high priest see above 1 Mac chap 7 ver 9 as Menelaus had been
before him set up by Antiochus above chap 4 yet neither of them
were truly high priests for the true high priesthood was amongst the
Machabees who were also of the stock of Aaron and had strictly held
their religion and were ordained according to the rites commanded in
the law of MosesIbid Mingling  with the heathens that is in
their idolatrous worship

144 Came to king Demetrius in the year one hundred and fifty
presenting unto him a crown of gold and a palm and besides these
some boughs that seemed to belong to the temple And that day indeed he
held his peace

145 But having gotten a convenient time to further his madness being
called to counsel by Demetrius and asked what the Jews relied upon
and what were their counsels

146 He answered thereunto They among the Jews that are called
Assideans of whom Judas Machabeus is captain nourish wars and raise
seditions and will not suffer the realm to be in peace

147 For I also being deprived of my ancestors glory I mean of the
high priesthood am now come hither

148 Principally indeed out of fidelity to the kings interests but
in the next place also to provide for the good of my countrymen for
all our nation suffereth much from the evil proceedings of these men

149 Wherefore O king seeing thou knowest all these things take
care I beseech thee both of the country and of our nation according
to thy humanity which is known to all men

1410 For as long as Judas liveth it is not possible that the state
should be quiet

1411 Now when this man had spoken to this effect the rest also of the
kings friends who were enemies of Judas incensed Demetrius against
him

1412 And forthwith he sent Nicanor the commander over the elephants
governor into Judea

1413 Giving him in charge to take Judas himself and disperse all
them that were with him and to make Alcimus the high priest of the
great temple

1414 Then the Gentiles who had fled out of Judea from Judas came to
Nicanor by flocks thinking the miseries and calamities of the Jews to
be the welfare of their affairs

1415 Now when the Jews heard of Nicanors coming and that the
nations were assembled against them they cast earth upon their heads
and made supplication to him who chose his people to keep them for
ever and who protected his portion by evident signs

1416 Then at the commandment of their captain they forthwith removed
from the place where they were and went to the town of Dessau to meet
them

1417 Now Simon the brother of Judas had joined battle with Nicanor
but was frightened with the sudden coming of the adversaries

1418 Nevertheless Nicanor hearing of the valour of Judass
companions and the greatness of courage with which they fought for
their country was afraid to try the matter by the sword

1419 Wherefore he sent Posidonius and Theodotius and Matthias before
to present and receive the right hands

1420 And when there had been a consultation thereupon and the
captain had acquainted the multitude with it they were all of one mind
to consent to covenants

1421 So they appointed a day upon which they might come together by
themselves and seats were brought out and set for each one

1422 But Judas ordered armed men to be ready in convenient places
lest some mischief might be suddenly practised by the enemies so they
made an agreeable conference

1423 And Nicanor abode in Jerusalem and did no wrong but sent away
the flocks of the multitudes that had been gathered together

1424 And Judas was always dear to him from the heart and he was well
affected to the man

1425 And he desired him to marry a wife and to have children So he
married he lived quietly and they lived in common

1426 But Alcimus seeing the love they had one to another and the
covenants came to Demetrius and told him that Nicanor had assented to
the foreign interest for that he meant to make Judas who was a
traitor to the kingdom his successor

1427 Then the king being in a rage and provoked with this mans
wicked accusation wrote to Nicanor signifying that he was greatly
displeased with the covenant of friendship and that he commanded him
nevertheless to send Machabeus prisoner in all haste to Antioch

1428 When this was known Nicanor was in a consternation and took it
grievously that he should make void the articles that were agreed upon
having received no injury from the man

1429 But because he could not oppose the king he watched an
opportunity to comply with the orders

1430 But when Machabeus perceived that Nicanor was more stern to him
and that when they met together as usual he behaved himself in a rough
manner and was sensible that this rough behaviour came not of good he
gathered together a few of his men and hid himself from Nicanor

1431 But he finding himself notably prevented by the man came to the
great and holy temple and commanded the priests that were offering the
accustomed sacrifices to deliver him the man

1432 And when they swore unto him that they knew not where the man
was whom he sought he stretched out his hand to the temple

1433 And swore saying Unless you deliver Judas prisoner to me I
will lay this temple of God even with the ground and will beat down
the altar and I will dedicate this temple to Bacchus

1434 And when he had spoken thus he departed But the priests
stretching forth their hands to heaven called upon him that was ever
the defender of their nation saying in this manner

1435 Thou O Lord of all things who wantest nothing wast pleased
that the temple of thy habitation should be amongst us

1436 Therefore now O Lord the holy of all holies keep this house
for ever undefiled which was lately cleansed

1437 Now Razias one of the ancients of Jerusalem was accused to
Nicanor a man that was a lover of the city and of good report who
for his kindness was called the father of the Jews

1438 This man for a long time had held fast his purpose of keeping
himself pure in the Jews religion and was ready to expose his body
and life that he might persevere therein

1439 So Nicanor being willing to declare the hatred that he bore the
Jews sent five hundred soldiers to take him

1440 For he thought by ensnaring him to hurt the Jews very much

1441 Now as the multitude sought to rush into his house and to break
open the door and to set fire to it when he was ready to be taken he
struck himself with his sword

He struck himself etc  St Augustine Epist 61 ad Dulcitium et
lib 2 cap 23 ad Epist 2 Gaud discussing this fact of Razias
says that the holy scripture relates it but doth not praise it as to
be admired or imitated and that either it was not well done by him or
at least not proper in this time of grace

1442 Choosing to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of the
wicked and to suffer abuses unbecoming his noble birth

1443 But whereas through haste he missed of giving a sure wound and
the crowd was breaking into the doors he ran boldly to the wall and
manfully threw himself down to the crowd

1444 But they quickly making room for his fall he came upon the
midst of the neck

He came upon the midst of the neck  Venit per mediam cervicem In the
Greek it is keneona which signifies a void place where there is no
building

1445 And as he had yet breath in him being inflamed in mind he
arose and while his blood ran down with a great stream and he was
grievously wounded he ran through the crowd

1446 And standing upon a steep rock when he was now almost without
blood grasping his bowels with both hands he cast them upon the
throng calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to restore these to
him again and so he departed this life



2 Machabees Chapter 15


Judas encouraged by a vision gains a glorious victory over Nicanor The
conclusion

151 But when Nicanor understood that Judas was in the places of
Samaria he purposed to set upon him with all violence on the sabbath
day

152 And when the Jews that were constrained to follow him said Do
not act so fiercely and barbarously but give honour to the day that is
sanctified and reverence him that beholdeth all things

153 That unhappy man asked if there were a mighty One in heaven
that had commanded the sabbath day to be kept

154 And when they answered There is the living Lord himself in
heaven the mighty One that commanded the seventh day to be kept

155 Then he said And I am mighty upon the earth and I command to
take arms and to do the kings business Nevertheless he prevailed not
to accomplish his design

156 So Nicanor being puffed up with exceeding great pride thought to
set up a public monument of his victory over Judas

157 But Machabeus ever trusted with all hope that God would help
them

158 And he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the nations
but to remember the help they had before received from heaven and now
to hope for victory from the Almighty

159 And speaking to them out of the law and the prophets and withal
putting them in mind of the battles they had fought before he made
them more cheerful

1510 Then after he had encouraged them he shewed withal the
falsehood of the Gentiles and their breach of oaths

1511 So he armed every one of them not with defence of shield and
spear but with very good speeches and exhortations and told them a
dream worthy to be believed whereby he rejoiced them all

1512 Now the vision was in this manner Onias who had been high
priest a good and virtuous man modest in his looks gentle in his
manners and graceful in speech and who from a child was exercised in
virtues holding up his hands prayed for all the people of the Jews

1513 After this there appeared also another man admirable for age
and glory and environed with great beauty and majesty

1514 Then Onias answering said This is a lover of his brethren and
of the people of Israel this is he that prayeth much for the people
and for all the holy city Jeremias the prophet of God

1515 Whereupon Jeremias stretched forth his right hand and gave to
Judas a sword of gold saying

1516 Take this holy sword a gift from God wherewith thou shalt
overthrow the adversaries of my people Israel

1517 Thus being exhorted with the words of Judas which were very
good and proper to stir up the courage and strengthen the hearts of
the young men they resolved to fight and to set upon them manfully
that valour might decide the matter because the holy city and the
temple were in danger

1518 For their concern was less for their wives and children and
for their brethren and kinsfolks but their greatest and principal
fear was for the holiness of the temple

1519 And they also that were in the city had no little concern for
them that were to be engaged in battle

1520 And now when all expected what judgment would be given and the
enemies were at hand and the army was set in array the beasts and the
horsemen ranged in convenient places

1521 Machabeus considering the coming of the multitude and the
divers preparations of armour and the fierceness of the beasts
stretching out his hands to heaven called upon the Lord that worketh
wonders who giveth victory to them that are worthy not according to
the power of their arms but according as it seemeth good to him

1522 And in his prayer he said after this manner Thou O Lord who
didst send thy angel in the time of Ezechias king of Juda and didst
kill a hundred and eightyfive thousand of the army of Sennacherib

1523 Send now also O Lord of heaven thy good angel before us for
the fear and dread of the greatness of thy arm

1524 That they may be afraid who come with blasphemy against thy
holy people And thus he concluded his prayer

1525 But Nicanor and they that were with him came forward with
trumpets and songs

1526 But Judas and they that were with him encountered them
calling upon God by prayers

1527 So fighting with their hands but praying to the Lord with their
hearts they slew no less than five and thirty thousand being greatly
cheered with the presence of God

1528 And when the battle was over and they were returning with joy
they understood that Nicanor was slain in his armour

1529 Then making a shout and a great noise they blessed the
Almighty Lord in their own language

1530 And Judas who was altogether ready in body and mind to die
for his countrymen commanded that Nicanors head and his hand with
the shoulder should be cut off and carried to Jerusalem

1531 And when he was come thither having called together his
countrymen and the priests to the altar he sent also for them that
were in the castle

1532 And shewing them the head of Nicanor and the wicked hand which
he had stretched out with proud boasts against the holy house of the
Almighty God

1533 He commanded also that the tongue of the wicked Nicanor should
be cut out and given by pieces to birds and the hand of the furious
man to be hanged up over against the temple

1534 Then all blessed the Lord of heaven saying Blessed be he that
hath kept his own place undefiled

1535 And he hung up Nicanors head in the top of the castle that it
might be an evident and manifest sign of the help of God

1536 And they all ordained by a common decree by no means to let
this day pass without solemnity

1537 But to celebrate the thirteenth day of the month of Adar called
in the Syrian language the day before Mardochias day

1538 So these things being done with relation to Nicanor and from
that time the city being possessed by the Hebrews I also will here
make an end of my narration

1539 Which if I have done well and as it becometh the history it is
what I desired but if not so perfectly it must be pardoned me

If not so perfectly etc  This is not said with regard to the truth
of the narration but with regard to the style and manner of writing
which in the sacred penmen is not always the most accurate See St
Paul 2 Cor 116

1540 For as it is hurtful to drink always wine or always water but
pleasant to use sometimes the one and sometimes the other so if the
speech be always nicely framed it will not be grateful to the readers
But here it shall be ended





APPENDICES



These texts come from the 1610 Doway printing of the second tome of the
Old Testament see the History section at the top of the etext The
primary sources provide a glimpse both into the history of the Douay
Rheims version and the English language itself The reader will quickly
notice that the letter j does not appear in the texts rather i
functions either as a vowel or a consonant Likewise u is not a
distinct letter it is employed typographically in the lowercase in
place of v where not starting a word The letters u and v both
function either as vowels or consonants The word vniuersity
demonstrates this rule The letter w is often employed but in some
cases the earlier form of a doublev vv appears instead

The transcriber has done his best to render the text accurately Note
the relaxed spelling standards of the time many variants appear While
the errata section from the 1610 edition observed We haue also found
some other faultes of lesse importance and feare there be more But we
trust the reader may easely correct them as they occurre only obvious
errors have been amended Where the transcriber has doubt between
whether an irregular spelling is either an error and a variant the
printed text stands 7bit ASCII cannot fully represent the
typographical standards of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and
many special characters have been replaced with modern equivalents
Where verse numbers stand in the margins of the printed texts they have
been transferred to the body the verse numbers in the Prayer of
Manasses have been supplied from other versions Reference notes have
been transferred from the margins and their abbreviations modernized

in most Latin and vulgare Bibles are here placed after al the Canonical

THE PRAYER OF MANASSES KING OF IVDA WHEN HE WAS HELD CAPTIVE IN BABYLON



LORD omnipotent God of our fathers Abraham  Isaac and Iacob and of
their iust sede 2 Par 3312 2 which didst make heauen and earth
with al the ornamentes of them 3 which hast bound the sea with the
word of thy precept which hast shut vp the depth and sealed it with
thy terrible and laudable name 4 whom al thinges dread  tremble at
the countinance of thy powre 5 because the magnificence of thy glorie
is importable  the wrath of thy threatning vpon sinners is
intollerable 6 but the mercie of thy promise is infinite and
vnsearchable 7 because thou art our Lord most high benigne long
suffering and very merciful and penitent vpon the wickednes of men
Thou Lord according to the multitude of thy goodnes hast promised
penance and remission to them that haue sinned to thee and by the
multitude of thy mercies thou hast decreed penance to sinners vnto
saluation 8 Thou therfore Lord God of the iust hast not appointed
penance to the iust Abraham  Isaac and Iacob them that haue not
sinned to thee but hast appointed penance for me a sinner 9 because
I haue sinned aboue the number of the sand of the sea Myne iniquities
Lord be multiplied mine iniquities be multiplied and I am not worthie
to behold  looke vpon the height of heauen for the multitude of mine
iniquities 10 I am made crooked with manie a band of yron that I can
not lift vp my head and I haue not respiration because I haue stirred
vp thy wrath and haue done euil before thee I haue not done thy wil
and thy commandmentes I haue not kept I haue set vp abominations and
multiplied offenses 11 And now I bowe the knee of my hart beseeching
goodnes of thee 12 I haue sinned Lord I haue sinned  I acknowlege
myne iniquities 13 Wherefore I beseech disiring thee forgeue me
Lord forgeue me and destroy me not together with myne iniquities
neither reserue thou for euer being angrie euils for me neither damme
me into the lowest places of the earth because thou art Lord God I
say of the penitent 14 in me thou shalt shew al thy goodnes because
thou shalt saue me vnworthie according to thy great mercie 15 and I
wil prayse thee alwayes al the dayes of my life because al the power of
the heauens prayseth thee and to thee is glorie for euer and euer
Amen

AND Iosias made a Pasch in Ierusalem to our Lord  immolated the Phase
the fourtenth moone of the moneth 4 Kings 2321  2 Par 351
2 appointing the Priestes by courses of dayes clothed with stoles in the
temple of our Lord 3 And he spake to the Leuites the sacred seruantes
of Isreal that they should sanctifie them selues to our Lord in the
placing of the holie arke of our Lord in the house which king Salomon
sonne of Dauid built 4 It shal not be for you to take it vpon your
shoulders And now serue your Lord and take the care of that nation
Israel in part according to your villages and tribes 5 according to the
writing of Dauid king of Israel and according to the magnificence of
Salomon his sonne al in the temple and according to your fathers
portion of principalitie among them that stand in the sight of your
brethren the children of Isreal 6 Immolate the Pasch and prepare the

Lord which was geuen to Moyses Ex 12  Lev 23  Num 28 7 And Iosias

were written in the booke of Moyses 12 and rosted the Phase with fire

thinges were consummate that perteyned to the sacrifice of our Lord
18 In that day they celebrated the Phase and offered hostes vpon the
sacrifice of our Lord according to the precept of king Iosias 19 And
the children of Israel that were found at that time celebrated the
Phase and the festiual day of Azymes for seuen dayes 20 and there was
not celebrated such a Phase in Isreal from the times of Samuel the
prophet 21 and al the kinges of Israel did not celebrate such a Phase
as Iosias did and the Priestes and the Leuites and the Iewes and al
Israel that were found in their abode at Ierusalem 22 In the eightenth
yeare Iosias reigning was the Phase celebrated 23 And the workes of
Iosias were directed in the sight of his Lord in a hart ful of feare
24 and the thinges concerning him are writen in the ancient times
touching them that sinned and were irreligous against our Lord aboue al
nations and that sought not the wordes of our Lord vpon Israel 25 And
after al this fact of Iosias came vp Pharao the king of AEgypt comming
in Charcamis from the way vpon Euphrates and Iosias went forth to meete
him 4 Kings 2329  2 Par 3520 26 And the king of AEgypt sent to
Iosias saying What is there betwen me  thee king of Iuda 27 I was
not sent of the Lord to fight against thee for my battel is vpon
Euphrates goe downe in hast 28 And Iosias did not returne vpon his
chariote but endeuoured to ouerthrow him not attending the word of the
prophet from the mouth of our Lord 29 but he made battel against him in
the field of Mageddo And princes went downe to king Iosias 30 And the
king said to his seruantes Remoue me from the battel for I am weakned
excedingly And forthwith his seruantes remoued him out of the battel
31 And he went vp into his second chariote  comming to Ierusalem
dyed and was buried in his fathers sepulchre 32 And in al Iurie they
mourned for Iosias  the rulers with their wiues lamented him vntil this
day And this was geuen out to be done alwayes vnto al the stocke of
Israel 33 But these thinges were writen before in the booke of the
histories of the kinges of Iuda and al the actes of the doing of
Iosias and his glorie and his vnderstanding in the law of our Lord and
the thinges that were done by him and that are not writen in the booke
of the kinges of Israel and Iuda 34 And they that were of the nation
taking Iechonias the sonne of Iosias made him king for Iosias his
father when he was three and twentie yeares old 4 Kings 2330 
2 Par 361 35 And he reigned ouer Israel three monethes And the king
of AEgypt remoued him that he should not reigne in Ierusalem 36 and he
put a taxe vpon the nation of siluer an hundred talentes and of gold one
talent 37 And the king of AEgypt made Ioacim his brother king of Iuda
and Ierusalem 38 and he bound the magistrates of Ioacim and Zaracel
his brother and taking them brought them backe into AEgypt 39 Ioacim
was fiue and twentie yeares old when he began to reigne in the land of
Iuda and Ierusalem and he did euil in the sight of our Lord 40 And
after this man came vp Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon and binding
him with a bande of brasse brought him into Babylon 41 And
Nabuchodonosor tooke the sacred vessels of our Lord and carried away
and consecrated them in his temple in Babylon 42 For his vncleanes and
lacke of religion is written in the booke of the times of the kinges
43 And Ioachin his sonne reigned for him And when he was made king he
was eightene yeares old 44 And reigned three monethes and ten dayes in
Ierusalem and did euil in the sight of our Lord 45 and after a yeare
Nabuchodonosor sending transported him into Babylon together with the
sacred vessels of our Lord 4 Kings 2413 46 And he made Sedecias
king of Iuda and Ierusalem when he was one and twentie yeares old
4 Kings 2417 and he reigned eleuen yeares 47 And he did euil in the
sight of our Lord and was not afraid of the wordes which were spoken by
Ieremie the prophet from the mouth of our Lord Jer 372 48 and being
sworne of king Nabuchodonosor forsworne he did reuolt and his necke
being hardened  his hart he transgressed the ordinances of our Lord
the God of Israel 49 And the princes of the people of our Lord did
manie thinges wickedly and they did impiously aboue al the vncleannes of
the nations and they polluted the temple of our Lord that was holie of
Ierusalem 50 And the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to
reclame them for that he would spare them and his tabernacle 51 But
they scorned at his messengers and in the day that our Lord spake to
them they were mocking his prophetes 52 Who was moued euen vnto wrath
vpon his nation for their impietie and commanded the kinges of the
Chaldees to come vp 53 These slewe their yong men with the sword round
about their holie temple and spared not yong man and old man and
virgin and youth 54 but al were deliuered into their handes  taking
al the sacred vessels of our Lord and the kinges treasures they caried
them into Babylon 55 and burnt the house of our Lord and threwe downe
the walles of Ierusalem and the towres therof they burnt with fire
56 and consumed al their honorable thinges and brought them to naught
and those that were left of the sword they led into Babylon 57 And
they were his seruants vntil the Persians reigned in the fulfilling of
the word of our Lord by the mouth of Ieremie Jer 2512  Jer 2910 
Dan 92 58 as long as the land quietly kept her sabbathes al the time
of her desolation she sabbathized in the application of seuentie yeares



CHAP II


Cyrus king of Persia permitteth the Iewes to returne into their countrie
10 and deliuereth to them the holie vessels which Nabuchodonosor had
taken from the temple 16 Certaine aduersaries writing to king
Artaxerxes hinder those that would repayre the ruines of Ierusalem

CYRVS king of the Persians reigning for the accomplishment of the word of
our Lord by the mouth of Ieremie 2 Par 3622  1 Esd 11  1 Esd 63 
Jer 2512  Jer 2910  Dan 92 2 our Lord raysed vp the spirit of Cyrus
king of the Persians and he proclaymed in al his kingdomes and that by
writing 3 saying Thus sayth Cyrus king of the Persians The Lord of
Israel the high Lord hath made me king ouer the whole earth 4 and
hath signified to me to build him a house in Ierusalem which is in
Iurie 5 If there be any of your kinred his Lord goe vp with him into
Ierusalem 6 Whosoeuer therefore dwel about the places let them helpe
them that are in the same place in gold and siluer 7 in giftes with
horses and beastes and with other thinges which by vowes are added into
the temple of our Lord which is in Ierusalem 8 And the princes of the
tribes of the villages and of Iurie of the tribe of Beniamin  the
Priestes and the Leuites standing vp whom our Lord moued to goe vp and
to build the house of our Lord which is in Ierusalem and they that were
round about them 9 did helpe them with al their gold and siluer and
beastes and manie whose minde was stirred vp with many vowes 10 And
Cyrus the king brought forth the sacred vessel of our Lord which
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon transported out of Ierusalem and
consecrated them to his Idol 11 And Cyrus the king of Persians bringing
them forth deliuered them to Mithridatus who was ouer his treasures
12 And by him they were deliuered to Salmanasar president of Iurie
13 And of these this was the number Cuppes for libamentes of siluer two
thousand foure hundred basens of siluer thirtie phials of gold
thirtie also of siluer two thousand foure hundred and other vessels a
thousand 14 and al the vessels of gold and siluer were fiue thousand
eight hundred sixtie 15 And they were numbered to Salmanasar together
with them that came out of the captiuite of Babylon into Ierusalem
16 But in the times of Artaxerxes king of the Persians there wrote to
him of them that dwelt in Iurie and Ierusalem Balsamus and Mithridatus
and Sabellius and Rathimus Balthemus Sabellius scribe and the rest
dweling in Samaria and other places the epistle folowing to king
Artaxerxes 1 Esd 47 17 SIR thy seruantes Rathimus ouer
occurrentes and Sabellius the scribe and the other iudges of thy court
in Caelesyria and Phenice 18 And now be it knowen to our Lord the
king that Iewes came vp from you to vs coming into Ierusalem a
rebellious  very naughty citie do build the fornaces thereof and set
vp the walles and rayse the temple 19 And if this citie and the
walles shal be finished they wil not onlie not abyde to pay tributes
but also wil resist the kinges 20 And because that is in doing about
the temple we thought it should doe wel not to neglect this same thing
21 but to make it knowen to our Lord the king that if it shal seme good
o king it may be sought in the bookes of thy fathers 22 and thou shalt
find in the recordes thinges writen of these and thou shalt know that
this citie hath bene rebellious and trubling kinges and cities 23 and
the Iewes rebelles  making battels in it from time out of mind for the
which cause this citie was made desolate 24 Now therfore we doe thee to
vnderstand Lord king that if this citie shal be built and the walles
therof shal be erected there wil be no comming downe for thee into
Caelesyria  Phenice 25 Then wrote the king to Rathimus the writer of
the occurrentes and to Balthemus and to Sabellius the scribe and to
the rest ioyned with them and to the dwellers in Syria and Phenice as
foloweth 26 I haue read the epistle that you sent me I commanded
therfore search to be made  it was found that the same citie is from
the beginning rebellious to kinges 27 and the men rebelles and making
battels in it  there were most valient kinges ruling in Ierusalem and
exacting tributes in Caelesyria  Phenice 28 Now therfore I haue geuen
commandment to forbid those men to build the citie and to stay them that
nothing be done more then is 29 and that they proceeded not farder
wherof are euils so that there may be truble brougt vpon the kinges
30 Then these things being read which were writen of king Artaxerxes
Rathimus and Sabellius the scribe and they that were apointed with them
ioyning together in hast came to Ierusalem with a troupe of horsemen and
multitude  companie 31 and they begane to forbid the builders and
they ceased from building of the temple in Ierusalem til in the second
yeare of the reigne of Darius king of the Persians



CHAP III


After a solemne supper made to al the court and chief princes king
Darius sleeping 4 three esquires of the bodie keeping watch proposed
the question 10 VVhether wine or a King or wemen or the truth doth
excel 17 The first prayseth wine

KING Darius made a great supper to al his domestical seruantes and to al
the magistrates of Media and Persia 2 and to al that were purple and to
the praetors and counsuls and liuetenantes vnder him from India vnto
AEthiopia an hundred twentie seuen prouinces 3 And when they had eaten
and drunken and returned ful then Darius went vp into his chamber and
slept and awaked 4 Then those three youngmen kepers of his bodie
which garded the kings bodie sayd one to an other 5 Let euerie one of
vs say a word that may excel  whose word soeuer shal appeare wiser
then the others to him wil king Darius geue great giftes 6 to be
couered with purple  to drinke in gold and to sleepe vpon gold  a
chariote with a bridle of gold  a bonet of silke and a cheyne about
his necke 7 and he shal sit in the second place next Darius for his
wisdome And he shal be called the cosin of Darius 8 Then euerie one
writing his word signed it and they put it vnder the pillow of Darius
the king 9 and they sayd When the king shal rise we wil geue him our
writinges and which soeuer of the three the king shal iudge and the
magistrates of Persia that his word is the wiser to him shal the
victorie be geuen as is writen 10 One wrote Wine is strong 11 An
other wrote a King is stronger 12 The third wrote Wemen are more
strong but aboue al thinges truth ouercometh 13 And when the king was
risen they tooke their writinges and gaue him and he read 14 And
sending he called al the Magistrates of Persians and the Medes and them
that weare purple and the pretors and the ouerseers 15 and they sate
in the councel and the writinges were read before them 16 And he
sayd Cal the youngmen and they shal declare their owne wordes And
they were called and went in 17 And he sayd to them Declare vnto vs
concerning these thinges which are writen And the first began he that
had spoken of the strength of wine 18 and sayd O ye men how doth wine
preuaile ouer al men that drinke it seduceth the minde 19 And also
the mind of king and orphane it maketh vaine Also of the bondman and
the free of the rich man and the poore 20 and euerie mind it turneth
into securitie and pleasantnes and it remembreth not any sorow and
dewtie 21 and al hartes it maketh honest and it remembreth not king
nor magistrate and it maketh a man speake al thinges by talentes
22 And when they haue drunke they remember not frendship nor
brotherhood yea and not long after they take swordes 23 And when they
are recouered and risen from the wine they remember not what they haue
done 24 O ye men doth not wine excel who thinketh to doe so And
hauing sayd this he held his peace



CHAP IIII


The second prayseth the excellencie of a king 13 The third which is
Zorobabel commendeth wemen 33 but preferreth truth aboue al
41 VVhich is so approued and he is rewarded 42 The king moreouer at
his request restoreth the holie vessels of the temple and granteth
meanes to build the citie of Ierusalem and the temple

AND the next began to speake he that spake of the strength of a king
2 O ye men doe not the men excel which obteyne land and sea and al
thinges that are in them 3 But a king excelleth aboue al thinges and
hath dominion ouer them and euerie thing whatsoeuer he shal say to
them they doe 4 And if he send them to warryers they goe and throw
downe mountaines and the walles and towers 5 They kil and are
killed and the kinges word they transgresse not For if they shal
ouercome they bring to the king al thinges whatsoeuer they haue taken
for a praye 6 In like maner also al others for so many as are not
souldiars nor fight but til the ground when they shal reape againe
they bring tributes to the king 7 And he being one onlie if he say
Kil ye they kil say he forgeue the forgeue 8 say he strike
they strike say he destroy they destroy say he build they build
9 say he cut downe they cut downe say he plant they plant 10 and al
the people  potestates here him and beside this he sitteth downe and
drinketh and sleepeth 11 And others gard him round about and can not
goe euerie one and doe their owne workes but at a word are obedient to
him 12 O ye men how doth not a king excel that is so renowmed And he
held his peace 13 The third that spake of wemen and truth this is
Zorobabel began to speake 14 O ye men not the great king  many men
neither is it wine that dothe excel Who is it then that hath the
dominion of them 15 Haue not wemen brought forth the king and al the
people that ruleth ouer land  sea 16 and were they not borne of them
and did not they bring vp them which planted the vineyardes whereof wine
is made 17 And they make the garmentes of al men  they doe honor to
al men and men can not be separed from wemen 18 If they haue gathered
gold and siluer and euerie beutiful thing  see a woman comelie and
fayre 19 leauing al these thinges they fixe their looke vpon her  with
open mouth beholde her and allure her more then gold and siluer and
euerie precious thing 20 Man forsaketh his father that brought him vp
and his countrie and ioyneth himself to a woman 21 And with a woman he
refresheth his soul and neither doth he remember father nor mother
nor countrie 22 And hereby you must know that wemen rule ouer you Are
you not sorie 23 And a man taketh his sword  goeth into the way to
commit theftes and murders  to sayle seas  riuers 24 and seeth a
lyon and goeth in darkenes and when he hath committed theft and
fraude and spoyles he bringeth it to his beloued 25 And againe man
loueth his wife more then father or mother 26 And many haue become
madde for their wiues and haue been made bondmen for them 27 and many
haue perished and bene slayne and haue sinned for wemen 28 And now
beleue me that the king is great in his powre because al countries are
afrayd to touch him 29 Neuertheles I saw Apemes the daughter of Bezaces
the concubine of a meruelous king sitting by the king at his right hand
30 and taking of the crowne from his head and putting it vpon her self
and with the palme of her left hand she stroke the king 31 And beside
these thinges he with open mouth beheld her and if she smiled he
laugheth and if she be angrie with him he flattereth til he be
reconciled to her fauour 32 O ye men why are not wemen stronger
Great is the earth and high is the heauen who doeth these thinges
33 And then the king and they that weare purple looked one vpon an other
And he began to speake of truth 34 O ye men are not wemen strong The
earth is great and heauen is high  the swift course of the sunne
turneth the heauen round into his place in one day 35 Is not he
magnifical that doth these thinges and the truth great and stronger
aboue al thinges 36 Al the earth calleth vpon the truth heauen also
blesseth it and al workes are moued and tremble at it and there is not
any thing with it vniust 37 Wine is vniust the king is vniust wemen
are vniust al the sonnes of men are vniust and al their workes are
vniust and in them is not truth and they shal perish in their
iniquitie 38 and truth abydeth and groweth strong for euer and
liueth and preuayleth for euer and euer 39 Neither is there with it
acception of persons nor differences but the thinges that are iust it
doth to al men to the vniust and malignant and al men are wel pleased
in the workes thereof 40 And there is no vniust thing in the iudgement
therof but strength and reigne and power and maiestie of worldes
Blessed be the God of truth 41 And he left speaking And al the people
cryed and sayd Great is truth and it preuaileth 42 Then the king
sayd to him Aske if thou wilt any more then the thinges that are
writen and I wil geue it thee according as thou art found wiser then
thy neighbours  thou shalt sitte next to me and shalt be called my
cosin 43 Then sayd he to the king Be midful of thy vow which thou
hast vowed to build Ierusalem in the day that thou didst receiue the
kingdom 44 and to send backe al the vessels that were taken out of
Ierusalem which Cyrus separated when he sacked Babylon and would haue
sent them backe thither 45 And thou hast vowed to build the temple
which the Idumeians burnt when Iurie was destroyed of the Chaldees
46 And now this is that which I aske Lord  which I desire this is the
maiestie which I desire of thee that thou performe the vowe which thou
hast vowed to the king of heauen by thy mouth 47 Then Darius the king
rising vp kissed him and wrote letters to al the officers and

alone wil build to our Lord of Israel according as Cyrus the king of the
Persians hath commanded 72 And the nations of the land lying vpon them
that are in Iurie and lifting vp the worke of the building and bringing
ambushmentes and peoples prohibited them to build 73 and practising
assaultes hindred them that the building might not be finished al the
time of the life of king Cyrus and they differred the building for two

CHAP VI


The Iewes by assistance of king Darius build vp the Temple in Ierusalem

AND in the second yeare of the reigne of Darius prophecied Aggeus and
Zacharias the sonne of Addo the prophet to Iurie and Ierusalem in the
name of God of Israel vpon them 1 Esd 51 2 Then Zorobabel the sonne
of Salathiel standing vp and Iesus the sonne of Iosedec begane to build
the house of our Lord which is in Ierusalem 3 When the prophetes of
our Lord were present with them and did helpe them At the same time
came Sisennes to them the deputie of Syria and of Phenice and
Satrabuzanes and his felowes 4 and they sayd to them By whose
commandment build ye this house and this roofe and perfite al other
thinges And who are the workmen that build these thinges 5 And the
ancientes of the Iewes which were left of the captiuitie by our Lord
had fauoure when the visitation was made vpon them 6 And they were not
hindered from building til it was signified to Darius of al these
thinges and answer was receiued 7 A copie of the letter which they
sent to Darius SISENNES deputie of Syria and Phenice and Satrabuzanes
and his felowes in Syria and Phenice presidents to king Darius
greetings 8 Be al thinges knowen to our Lord the king that when we
came into the countrie of Iurie and had entered into Ierusalem we found
them building the great house of God 9 And the temple of polished
stones and of great and precious matter in the walles 10 And the
workes to be a doing earnestly and to succede and prosper in their
handes and in al glorie to be perfited most diligently 11 Then we
asked the ancients saying by whose permission build ye this house 
found these workes 12 And therfore we asked them that we might doe
thee to know the men  the ouerseers and we required of them a rolle of
the names of the ouerseers 13 But they answered vs saying We are the
seruantes of the Lord which made heauen and earth 14 And this house
was built these manie yeares past by a king of Israel that was great and
most valiant and was finished 15 And because our fathers were
prouoking to wrath and sinned agaynst God of Israel he deliuered them
into the handes of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon king of the
Chaldees 16 And throwing downe this house they burnt it and they led
the people captiue into Babylon 17 In the first yeare when Cyrus
reigned the king of Babylon Cyrus the king wrote to build this house
18 And these sacred vessels of gold and siluer which Nabuchodonosor had
taken out of the house which is in Ierusalem and had consecrated them in
his owne temple Cyrus brought them forth agayne out of the temple which
was in Babylon and they were deliuered to Zorobabel  to Salmanasar the
deputie 19 And it was commanded them that they should offer these
vessels  lay them vp in the temple which was in Ierusalem and build
the temple of God itself in his place 20 Then did Salmanasar lay the
fundations of the house of our Lord which is in Ierusalem and from
that time vntil now it is a building and is not accomplished 21 Now
therfore if thou thincke it good o king let it be sought in the kings
liberaries of Cyrus the king which are in Babylon 22 and if it shal be
found that the building of the house of the Lord which is in Ierusalem
begane by the counsel of Cyrus the king and it be thought good of our
Lord the king let him write to vs of these thinges 23 Then Darius the
king commanded search to be made in the libraries and there was found
in Ecbatana a towne that is in the countrie of Media one place wherin
were writen these wordes 1 Esd 61 24 IN THE FIRST YEARE of the
reigne of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded to build the house of the Lord
which is in Ierusalem where they did burne incense with dayly fire
25 the height wherof shal be of ten cubits  the bredth three score
cubites foure square with three stones polished and with a loft galerie
of wood of the same countrie  one new galerie and the expenses to be
geuen out of the house of Cyrus the king 26 And the sacred vesseles of
the house of the Lord as wel of gold as of siluer which Nabuchodonosor
tooke from the house of our Lord which is in Ierusalem where they were
layed that they be put there 27 And he commanded Sisennes the deputie
of Syria  Phoenice and Satrabuzanes and his felowes  them that were
ordayned presidentes in Syria  Phoenice that they should refraine
themselues from that place 28 And I also haue geuen commandment to
build it wholly and haue prouided that they helpe them which are of
the captiuitie of the Iewes til the temple of the house of the Lord be
accomplished 29 And from the vexation of the tributes of Coelesyria 
Phoenice a quantitie to be geuen diligently to these men for the
sacrifice of the Lord to Zorobabel the gouernour for oxen and rammes
and lambes 30 And in like maner corne also and salt and wine and
oyle continually yeare by yeare according as the priestes which are in
Ierusalem haue prescribed to be spent dayly 31 that libamentes may be
offered to the most high God for the king  his children  that they may
pray for their life 32 And that it be denounced that whosoeuer shal
transgresse anie thing of these which are writen or shal despise it a
beame be taken of theyr owne  they be hanged  their goodes be
confiscate to the king 33 Therfore the Lord also whose name is
inuocated there destroy euery king  nation that shal extend their hand
to hinder or to handle il the house of the Lord which is in Ierusalem
34 I Darius the king haue decreed that it be most diligently done
according to these thinges

sinnes of al Israel twelue according to the number of the tribes of
Israel 9 And the Priestes and Leuites stood clothed with stoles by
tribes ouer al the workes of our Lord the God of Israel according to
the booke of Moyses and the porters at euerie gate 10 And the children
of Israel wih them that were of the captiuitie celebrated the phase of
the fourtenth moone of the first moneth when the Priestes and Leuites
were sanctified 11 Al the children of the captiuitie were not
sanctified together because al the Leuites were sanctified together
12 And al the children of the captuitie immolated the phase both for
their brethren the Priestes and for them selues 13 And the children of
Israel did eate they that were of the captiuitie al that remayned apart
from al the abominations of the nations of the land seeking our Lord
14 And they celebrated the festiual day of Azymes seuen dayes feasting in
the sight of our Lord 15 Because he turned the counsel of the king of
the Assirians toward them to strengthen their handes to the workes of
our Lord the God of Israel

Babylon in the newmoone of the fifth moneth 7 they came to Ierusalem
according to his commandment according to the prosperitie of their

knowlege that he would not pretermitte anie of those thinges which were
according to the law and the preceptes of our Lord and in teaching al
Israel al iusticie and iudgement 9 And they that wrote the writinges of
Araxerxes the king coming deliuered the writing which was granted of
Artaxerxes the king to Esdras the Priest  the reader of the law of our
Lord the copie wherof here foloweth 10 KING Artaxerxes to Esdras the
Priest and reader of the law of the Lord greeting 11 I of curtesie
esteming it among benifites haue commanded them that of their owne
accord are desirous of the nation of the Iewes and of the Priestes and
Leuites which are in my kingdom to goe with thee into Ierusalem 12 If
anie therfore desire to goe with thee let them come together and set
forward as it hath pleased me and my seuen freindes my counselers
13 that they may visite those thinges which are done touching Iurie and
Ierusalem obseruing as thou hast in the law of the Lord 14 And let
them carie the giftes to the Lord the God of Israel which I haue vowed
and my freindes to Ierusalem and al the gold and siluer that shal be
found in the countrie of Babylon to the Lord in Ierusalem with that
15 which is geuen for the nation it self vnto the temple of their Lord
which is in Ierusalem that this gold and siluer be gathered for oxen
and rammes and lambes and kiddes and for the thinges that are agreable
to these 16 that they may offer hostes to the Lord vpon the altar of
their Lord which is in Ierusalem 17 And al thinges whatsoeuer thou
with thy brethren wilt doe with gold and siluer doe it at thy pleasure
according to the precept of the Lord thy God 18 And the sacred vessels
which are geuen thee to the workes of the house of the Lord thy God
which is in Ierusalem 19 And other thinges whatsoeuer shal helpe thee
to the workes of the temple of thy God thou shalt geue it out of the
kings treasure 20 When thou with thy brethren wilt doe ought with gold
and siluer doe according to the wil of the Lord 21 And I king
Artaxerxes haue geuen commandment to the keepers of the treasure of Syria
and Phaenice that what thinges soeuer Esdras the Priest and reader of
the law of the Lord shal write for they geue him vnto an hundred
talentes of siluer likewise also of gold 22 And vnto an hundred
measures of corne  an hundred vessels of wine and other thinges
whatsoeuer abound without taxing 23 Let al thinges be done to the most
high God according to the law of God lest perhaps there arise wrath in
the reigne of the king and of his sonne and his sonnes 24 And to you
it is sayd that vpon al the Priestes and Leuites and sacred singers
and seruantes of the temple  scribes of this temple 25 no tribute nor
any other taxe be sette and that no man haue auctoritie to obiect any
thing to them 26 But thou Esdras according to the wisedom of God
appoynt iudges and arbitrers in al Syria and Phaenice and teach al
them that know no the law of thy God 27 that whosoeuer shal transgresse
the law they be diligently punished either with death or with torment
or els with a forfeite of money or with banishment 28 And Esdras the
scribe sayd Blessed be the God of our fathers which hath geuen this
wil into the kings hart to glorifie his house which is in Ierusalem
29 And hath honoured me in the sight of the king and of his counselers
and freindes and them that weare purple 30 And I was made constant in
minde according to the ayde of our Lord my God and gathered together of
Israel men that should goe vp together with me 31 And these are the
princes according to their kindredes and seueral principalities of them
that came vp from Babylon the kingdom of Artaxerxes 1 Esd 81 32 Of

together to the riuer that is called Thia and we camped there three
dayes and vewed them againe 44 And of the children of the Priestes and
Leuites I found not there 45 And I sent to Eleazarus and Eccelon and
Masman and Maloban and Enaathan and Samea and Ioribum Nathan
Enuaugam Zacharias and Mosolam the leaders them selues and that were
skilful 46 And I sayd to them that they should come to Loddeus who was
at the place of the treasurie 47 And I commanded them to say to
Loddeus and his brethren and to them that were in the treasurie that
they should send vs them that might doe the function of priesthood in the
house of the Lord our God 48 And they brought vnto vs according to the
mightie hand of the Lord our God cunning men of the children of Moholi

that serued the temple whom Dauid gaue and the princes themselues to
the ministerie of the Leuites of them that serued the temple two hundred

there a fast to the yong men in the sight of God that I might aske of
him a good iourney for vs and them that were with vs and for the
children and the cattel because of ambushementes 52 For I was ashamed
to aske of the king footemen and horsemen in my companie to guard vs
against our aduersaries 53 For we sayd to the king that the power of
our Lord wil be with them that seeke him with al affection 54 And
agayne we besought the Lord our God according to these thinges whom
also we had propicious and we obteyned of our God 55 And I separated
of the rulers of the people and of the Priestes of the temple twelue
men and Sedebia and Asanna and with them of their brethren ten men
56 And I weyed to them the gold and siluer and the vessels of the house
of our God perteyning to the Priestes which the king had geuen and his

deliuer them to some of the rulers of the people and to the Priestes
and Leuites and to the princes of the cities of Israel in Ierusalem in
the treasurie of the house of our God 61 And those Priestes and Leuites
that receiued the gold and siluer and vessels brought it to Ierusalem
into the temple of our Lord 62 And we went forward from the riuer Thia
the twelfth day of the first moneth til we entred into Ierusalem
63 And when the third day was come in the fourth day the gold being
weyed and the siluer was deliuered in the house of the Lord our God to
Marimoth Priest the sonne of Iori 64 And with him was Eleazar the sonne
of Phinees and with them were Iosadus the sonne of Iesus and Medias
and Banni the sonne of a Leuite by number and weight al thinges 65 And
the weight of them was writen the same houre 66 And they that came out
of the captiuitie offered sacrifice to our Lord the God of Israel oxen
twelue for al Israel rammes eightie six 67 lambes seuentie two bucke
goates for sinne twelue and for health twelue kyne al for the sacrifice
of our Lord 68 And they read againe the preceptes of the king to the
kinges officers and to the deputies of Coelesyria and Phoenice and
they honored the nation and the temple of our Lord 69 And these
thinges being finished the rulers came to me saying The stocke of
Isreal and the princes and the Priestes and the Leuites 1 Esd 91
70 and the strange people and nations of the land haue not separated
their vncleannes from the Chananeites and Hetheites and Pherezeites
and Iebuseites and Moobites  AEgyptians and Idumeians 71 For they
are ioyned to their daughters both themselues and their sonnes and the
holie sede is mingled with the strange nations of the earth and the
rulers and magistrates were partakers of that iniquitie from the
beginning of the reigne it self 72 And forthwith as I heard these
thinges I rent my garmentes and sacred tunike and tearing the heares
of my head and my beard I sate sorowful and heauie 73 And there
assembled to me mourning vpon this iniquitie as manie as were then moued
by the word of our Lord the God of Israel and I sate sad vntil the
euening sacrifice 74 And I rising vp from fasting hauing my garmentes
rent and the sacred tunike kneeling and stretching forth my handes to
our Lord 75 I sayd Lord I am confounded and ashamed before thy face
76 for our sinnes are multiplied ouer our heades and our iniquities are
exalted euen to heauen 77 Because from the times of our fathers we are
in great sinne vnto this day 78 And for the sinnes of vs and of our
fathers we haue bene deliuered with our brethren and with our Priestes
to the kinges of the earth into sword and captiuitie and spoile with
confusion vnto this present day 79 And now what a great thing is this
that mercie hath happened to vs from thee o Lord God  leaue thou vnto
vs a roote and a name in the place of thy sanctification 80 to discouer
our light in the house of the Lord our God to geue vs meate in al the
time of our bondage 81 And when we serued we were not forsaken of the
Lord our God but he sette vs in fauour appointing the kinges of the
Persians to geue us meate 82 and to glorifie the temple of the Lord our
God and to build the desolations of Sion to geue vs stabilitie in
Iurie and Ierusalem 83 And now what say we Lord hauing these thinges
For we haue transgressed thy preceptes which thou gauest into the handes
of thy seruantes the prophetes 84 saying That the land into which ye
entred to possesse the inheritance therof is a land polluted with the
coinquinations of the strangers of the land and their vncleanes hath
filled it wholy with their filthines 85 And now your daughters you shal
not match with their sonnes and their daughters you shal not take for
your sonnes 86 And you shal not seeke to haue peace with them for euer
that growing strong you may eate the best things of the land and may
distribute the inheritance to your children for euer 87 And the thinges
that happen to vs al are done for our nauhtie workes and our great
sinnes 88 And thou gauest vs such a roote and we are returned againe
to transgresse thy ordinances that we would be mingled with the
vncleannes of the nations of this land 89 Wilt not thou be wrath with
vs to destroy vs til there be no roote left nor our name 90 Lord God
of Israel thou art true For there is a roote left vntil this present
day 91 Behold now we are in thy sight in our iniquities For it is
not to stand any longer before thee in these matters 92 And when Esdras
with adoration confessed weeping lying flat on the ground before the
temple there were gathered before him out of Ierusalem a verie great
multitude men and wemen and yong men and yong wemen For there was
great weeping in the multitude it self 1 Esd 101 93 And when he had
cried Iechonias of Ieheli of the children of Israel sayd to Esdras We
haue sinned against our Lord for that we haue taken vnto vs in mariage
strange wemen of the nations of the land 94 And now thou art ouer al
Israel in these therfore let there be an othe from our Lord to expel al
our wiues that are of strangers with their children 95 As it was
decreed to thee of the ancesters according to the law of our Lord rising
vp declare it 96 For to thee the busines perteineth and we are with
thee doe manfully 97 And Esdras rysing vp adiured the princes of the
Priestes and Leuites and al Israel to doe according to these thinges and
they sware



CHAP IX

separate al strange wemen from them 18 The Priestes and Leuites which
had offended herein are recited 38 He readeth the law before the

 magnificence to our Lord the God of our fathers 9 and accomplish his
wil and depart from the nations of the land and from your wiues the
strangers 10 And al the multitude cried and they sayd with a lowde
voice As thou hast sayd we wil doe 11 But because the multitude is
great and winter time and we can not stand in the ayre without succour
and this is a worke for vs not of one day nor of two for we haue sinned
much in these thinges 12 Let the rulers of the multitude stand and
that dwel with vs and as manie as haue with them forreine wiues 13 and

4 And the word of our Lord came to me saying 5 Goe and tel my people
their wicked deedes and their children the iniquities that they haue
done against me that they may tel their childrens children 6 because
the sinnes of their parentes are increased in them for they being
forgetful of me haue sacrified to strange goddes 7 Did not I bring them
out of the land of AEgypt from the house of bondage But they haue
prouoked me  haue despised my counsels 8 But doe thou shake of the

42 I Esdras saw in mount Sion a great multiude which I could not number
and they did al prayse our Lord with songes Apoc 79 43 And in the
middes of them was a young man high of stature appearing aboue ouer them
al  he put crownes vpon euerie one of their heades and he was more
exalted And I was astonied at the miracle 44 Then asked I an Angel
and sayd Who are these Lord 45 Who answering sayd to me These are
they that haue laid of the mortal garment and taken an immortal and
haue confessed the name of God Now they are crowned and receiue
palmes 46 And I sayd to the Angel That yongman what is he which
putteth the crownes vpon them and geueth palmes into their handes
47 And answering he sayd to me The same is the Sonne of God whom they
did confesse in the world  I begane to magnifie them that stood
strongly for the name of our Lord 48 Then sayd the Angel to me Goe
tel my people what maner of meruelous thinges and how great thou hast
sene of the Lord God



CHAP III


The workes of God are wonderful from the beginning 7 and men vngrateful
13 In Abraham God chose to himself a peculiar people who neuertheles
were froward and obstinate 23 He also chose Dauid but stil the
people were sinful 28 the Babylonians also by whom the are afflicted
are no lesse but rather greater sinners

IN the thirteth yeare of the ruine of the citie I was in Babylon and was
trubled lying in my chamber and my cogitations came vp ouer my hart
2 because I saw the desolation of Sion and the abundance of them that
dwelt in Babylon 3 And my spirit was tossed excedingly and I began to
speake to the highest timorous wordes 4 and sayd O Lord dominatour
thou spakest from the beginning when thou didst plant the earth and
that alone and didst rule ouer the people Gen 1 5 and gauest Adam a
dead bodie but that also was the worke of thy handes  didst breath
into him the spirit of life and he was made to liue before thee
Gen 27 6 and thou broughst him into paradise which thy right hand
had planted before the earth came 7 And him thou didst command to loue
thy way and he transgressed it  forth with thou didst institute death
in him and in his posteritie and there were borne nations and tribes
and peoples and kindreds wherof there is no number 8 And euerie
nation walked in their owne wil  they did meruelous thinges before
thee and despised thy preceptes 9 And agane in time thou broughst in
the floud vpon inhabitantes of the world and didst destroy them
Gen 7 10 And there was made in euery one of them as vnto Adam to dye
so to them the floud 11 But thou didst leaue one of them Noe with his
house and of him were al the iust 12 And it came to passe when they
began to be multiplied that dwelt vpon the earth  multiplied children
and peoples and manie nations and they begane againe to doe impietie
more then the former 13 And it came to passe when they did iniquitie
before thee thou didst choose thee a man of them whose name was Abraham
14 And thou didst loue him and to him onlie thou didst shew thy wil
Gen 12 15 And thou didst dispose vnto him an euerlasting testament
and toldst him that thou wouldst neuer forsake his seede And thou
gauest him Issac and to Isaac thou gauest Iacob and Esau 16 And Iacob
thou didst seuer to thy selfe but Esau thou didst separate And Iacob
grewe to a great multitude 17 And it came to passe when thou didst
bring forth his sede out of AEgypt thou broughst it vpon mount Sinai
Ex 19 18 And thou didst bowe the heauens and fasten the earth and
didst shake the world and madest the depthes to tremble and trubledst
the world 19 and thy glorie passed foure gates of fire and of
earthquake and winde and frost that thou mightst geue a law to the
seede of Iacob and to the generation of Israel diligence 20 And thou
didst not take away from them a malignant hart that thy law might bring
forth fruite in them 21 For Adam the first bearing a vicious hart
transgressed and was ouercome yea and al that were borne of him 22 And
it was made a permanent infirmitie and the law with the hart of the
people with the wickednes of the roote and that which is good departed
and the wicked remayned 23 And the times passed  the yeares were
ended and thou didst raise vp vnto thee a seruant named Dauid 24 and
spakest vnto him to build a citie of thy name and to offer vnto thee in
it frankencense and oblations 25 And this was done manie yeares and
they that inhabited the citie forsooke thee 26 in al things as Adam and
al his generations For they also vsed a wicked hart 27 And thou didst
deliuer thy citie into the hands of thyne enimies 28 Why doe they
better thinges that inhabite Babylon And for this shal she rule ouer
Sion Jer 12 29 It came to passe when I was come hither and had sene
the impieties that can not be numbred and my soul saw manie offending
this thirteth yeare  my hart was astonied 30 because I saw how thou
bearest with their sinne and didst spare them that did impiously and
didst destroy thine owne people and preserue thine enimies and didst
not signifie it 31 I nothing remember how this way should be forsaken
doth Babylon better thinges then Sion 32 Or hath anie nation knowen
thee beside Israel or what tribes haue beleued thy testamentes as
Iacob 33 Whose reward hath not appeared nor their labour fructified
For passing through I passed among the nations and I saw them abound
and not mindeful of thy commandmentes 34 Now therfore wey our
iniquities in a ballance and theirs that dwel in the world  thy name
shal not be found but in Israel 35 Or when haue not they sinned in thy
sight that inhabite the earth or what nation hath so obserued thy
commandmentes 36 These certes by their names thou shalt finde to haue
kept thy commandments but the nations thou shalt not finde

Mans witte and reason is not able to vnderstand the counsel and iudgement

AND the Angel answered me that was sent to me whose name was Vriel
2 and sayd to me Thy hart exceding hath exceded in this world  thou
thinkest to comprehend the way of the Highest 3 And I sayd It is so
my Lord And he answered me  sayd I am sent to shew thee three
wayes  to propose to thee three similitudes 4 Of the which if thou
shalt declare to me one of them I also wil shew thee the way which thou
desirest to see and wil teach thee whence a wicked hart is 5 And I
sayd Speak my Lord And he sayd to me Goe wey me the weight of the
fire or measure me the blast of the winde or cal me backe the day that
is past 6 And I answered and sayd what man borne can doe it that
thou askest me of these thinges 7 And he sayd to me If I should aske
thee saying How great habitations are there in the hart of the sea or
how great vaines be there in the beginning of the depth or how great
vaines be there aboue the firmament and what are the issues of paradise
8 thou wouldest perhaps say to me I haue not descended into the depth
nor into hel as yet neither haue I ascended at anie time into heauen
9 But now I haue not asked thee sauing of the fire and the winde and
the day by the which thou hast passed and from the which thou canst not
be separated and thou hast not answered me of them 10 And he sayd to
me Thou canst not know the thinges that are thine which grow together
with thee 11 and how can thy vessel comprehend the way of the Highest
and now the world being outwardly corrupted vnderstand the corruption
euident in my sight 12 I sayd to him Better were it for vs not to be
then yet liuing to liue in impieties and to suffer and not to
vnderstand for what thing 13 And he answered me  said Going forth I
went forward to a wood of trees in the filde and they deuised a deuise
Judges 9  2 Par 25 14 and said Come and let vs goe and make warre
against the sea that it may retyre backe before vs and we may make vs
other woodes 15 And in like maner the waues of the sea they also
deuised a deuise and sayd Come let vs goe vp let vs ouerthrow the
woodes of the filde that there also we may consummate an other countrie
for our selues 16 And the woodes deuise was made vaine for fire came
and consumed it 17 Likewise also the deuise of the waues of the sea
For the sand stood  stayed them 18 For if thou wert iudge of these
whom wouldest thou begin to iustifie or whom to condemne 19 And I
answered and sayd Verely they deuised a vayne deuise For the earth
is geuen to the wood and a place to the sea to carie her waues 20 And
he answered me and sayed Thou hast iudged wel and why hast thou not
iudged for thy self 21 For as the earth is geuen to the wood and the
sea for the waues therof so they that inhabite vpon the earth can
vnderstand onlie the thinges that are vpon the earth and they vpon the
heauens the thinges that are aboue the height of the heauens 22 And I
answered and sayd I besech thee Lord that sense may be geuen me to
vnderstand 23 For I meant not to aske of thy superiour thinges but of
those that passe by vs dayly For what cause Israel is geuen into
reproche to the gentiles the people whom thou hast loued is geuen to
impious tribes  the law of our fathers is brought to destruction  the
written ordinances are no where 24 and we haue passed out of the world
as locustes and our life is astonishment and dreade and we are not
worthie to obtaine mercie 25 But what wil he doe to his name that is
inuocated vpon vs and of these thinges I did aske 26 And he answered
me and sayd If thou search very much thou shalt often meruail
because the world hastening hasteneth to passe 27 and can not comprehend
the thinges which in times to come are promised to the iust because
this world is ful of iniustice and infirmities 28 But conerning the
thinges that thou demandest I wil tel thee for the euil is sowed and
the destruction therof is not yet come 29 If then that which is sowen
be not turned vp and the place depart where the euil is sowen that shal
not come where the good is sowen 30 Because the grayne of il seede hath
bene sowen in the hart of Adam from the beginning and how much impietie
hath it ingendered vntil now and doth ingender vntil the floore come
31 And esteme with thy self the graine of the il seede how much fruite
of impietie it hath ingendred 32 When the eares shal be cut which are
innumerable what a great floore wil they begin to make 33 And I
answered and sayd How and when shal these things be why are our
yeares few and euil 34 And he answered me and sayd to me Hasten not
aboue the Highest For thou doest hasten in vaine to be aboue him for
thy excesse is much 35 Did not the soules of the iust in the cellars
aske of these things saying How hope I so and when shal the fruite
come of the floore of our reward 36 And Ieremiel the Archangel answered
to those things and sayd When the number of the sedes in you shal be
filled because he hath weyed the world in a balance 37 and with a
measure hath he measured the times and in number he hath numbered the
times and hath not moued nor stirred them vntil the foresayd measure
be filled 38 And I answered and sayd O Lord Dominatour we also are
al ful of impietie 39 And left perhaps for vs the floores of the iust
be not filled for the sinnes of the inhabitantes vpon the earth 40 And
he answered me and sayd Goe and aske a woman with childe if when
she hath accomplished her nine monethes her wombe can yet hold the
infant within it 41 And I sayd it can not Lord And he sayd to me in
hel the cellars of the soules are like to the matrice 42 For as she
that is In trauail maketh hast to escape the necessitie of trauailing
so this also hasteneth to render those thinges which are commended to it
43 From the beginning it shal be shewed thee touching those thinges
which thou doest couet to see 44 And I answered and sayd If I haue
found grace before thine eyes  if it be possible and if I by fitte
45 shew mee if there be more to come then is passed or more things haue
passed then are to come 46 What passed I know but what is to come
I know not 47 And he sayd to me Stand vpon the right side and I wil
shew thee the interpretation of the similitude 48 And I stood and saw
and behold a burning fornace passed before me  it came to passe when
the flame passed I saw and behold the smoke ouercame 49 And these
thinges there passed before me a clowd ful of water and with violence
casting in much raine and when the violence of raine was cast the
droppes therin ouercame 50 And he sayd to me Thinke with thyself as
the raine increaseth more then the droppes and the fire then the smoke
so did the measure that passed more a bound But the droppes and the
smoke ouercame 51 and I prayed  sayd shal I liue thinkest thou vntil
these dayes or what shal be in those dayes 52 He answered me and
sayd Of the signes wherof thou askest me in part I can tel thee
howbeit of thy life I was not sent to tel thee neither doe I know



CHAP V


Diuers signes of thinges to come are shewed to Esdras by an Angel
16 for the comforth of the people in captiuitie

BVT concerning signes behold the dayes shal come wherin they that
inhabite the earth shal be taken in a great number and the way of truth
shal be hid and the countrie shal be barren from fayth 2 And
iniustice shal be multiplied aboue that which thy self seest  aboue
that which thou hast heard in time past Matt 24 3 And they shal put
their foote into the countrie which now thou seest to reigne and they
shal see it desolate 4 And if the Highest geue thee life thou shalt
see after the third trumpet and the sunne shal sodenly shine agayne in
the night and the moone thrise in a day 5 and out of wood bloud shal
distil and the stone shal geue his voice and the peoples shal be moued
6 and he reigne whom they hope not that inhabite vpon the earth and
soules shal make their flight away 7  the sea of Sodom shal cast the
fishes and shal make a noise in the night which manie knew not and al
shal heare the voice therof 8 and there shal be made a confusion in
manie places and the fire shal often be sent backe and the sauage
beastes shal goe to other places and wemen in their monethlie flowers
shal bring forth monsters 9 and in swete waters shal salt waters be
found and al frendes shal ouerthrow one an other and then shal witte
be hid and vnderstanding shal be separated into his cellar 10 and it
shal be sought of manie and shal not be found and iniustice shal be
multiplied and incontinencie vpon the earth 11 And one countrie shal
aske her neighbour and shal say Hath iustice doing iust passed
throught thee and she shal denie it 12 And it shal be in that time
men shal hope and shal not obtaine they shal labour and their wayes
shal not haue successe 13 These signes I am permitted to tel thee and
if thou pray againe and weepe as also now and fast seuen dayes thou
shalt heare againe greater thinges then these 14 And I awaked and my
bodie did shiuer excedingly and my soule laboured that it fainted
15 and the Angel that came that spake in me held me and strengthened
me and sette me vpon my feete 16 And it came to passe in the second
night and Salathiel the prince of the people came to me and sayd to me
Where wast thou and why is thy countenance heauie 17 Knowest thou not
that Isreal is committed to thee in the countrie of their transmigration
18 Rise vp therfore and taste bread and forsake vs not as the pastour
his flocke in the hand of wicked wolues 19 And I sayd to him Goe from
me  approch not vnto me And he heard as I sayd and he departed
from me 20 And I fasted seuen dayes howling  weeping as Vriel the
Angel commanded me 21 And it came to passe after seuen dayes and
againe cogitations of my hart molested me very much 22 and my soule
resumed the spirit of vnderstanding  agayne I began to speake wordes
before the Highest 23 and I sayd Lord Dominatour of euerie wood of
the earth  al the trees therof thou hast chosen one vineyard 24  of
euerie land of the world thou hast chosen thee one ditch  of al the
flowers of the world thou hast chosen thee one lilie 25 and of al
depthes of the sea thou hast filled thee one riuer and of al the
builded cities thou hast sanctified vnto thyself Sion 26 and of al
created soules thou hast named thee one doue and of al beastes that
were made thou hast prouided thee one shepe 27 and of al multiplied
peoples thou host purchased thee one people and a law approued of al
thou hast geuen to this people whom thou didst desire 28 And now Lord
why hast thou deliuered one vnto manie And thou hast perpared vpon one
roote others and hast dispersed thy onlie one in manie 29 and they
haue troden vpon it which gainesayd thy couenants and which beleued not
thy testamentes 30 And if hating thou hatest thy people it ought to be
chastised with thy handes 31 And it came to passe when I had spoken
the wordes and the Angel was sent to me that came to me before the
night past 32 and he sayd to me Heare me and I wil instruct thee
and harken to me and I wil adde before thee 33 And I sayd Speake my
Lord And he sayd to me Thou art become excedingly in excesse of minde
for Israel hast thou loued it more then him that made it 34 And I
sayd to him No Lord but for sorow I haue spoken for my veynes torment
me euerie houre to apprehend the pathe of the Highest and to search
part of his iudgement 35 And he sayd to me Thou canst not And I
sayd Why Lord To what was I borne or why was not my mothers wombe my
graue that I might not see the labour of Iacob  the wearines of the
stocke of Israel 36 And he sayd to me Number me the thinges that are
not yet come and gather me the dispersed droppes and make me the
withered flowers grene againe 37 and open me the shut cellars  bring
me forth the blastes inclosed in them shew me the image of a voice and
then wil I shew thee the labour that thou desirest to see 38 And I
sayd Lord Dominatour for who is there that can know these thinges but
he that hath not his habitation with men 39 And I am vnwise and how
can I speake of these thinges which thou hast asked me 40 And he sayd
to me As thou canst not doe one of these thiges which haue bene sayd
so canst thou not finde my iudgement or in the end the charitie which I
haue promised to the people 41 And I sayd But behold Lord thou art
nigh to them that are nere the end and what shal they doe that haue
bene before me or we or they after vs 42 And he sayd to me I wil
resemble my iudgement to a crowne As there shal not be slacknes of the
last so neither swiftnes of the former 43 And I answered and sayd
Couldst thou not make them that haue bene and that are and that shal
be at once that thou mayst shew thy iudgement the quicker 44 And he
answered me and sayd The creature can not hasten aboue the Creatour
nor the world sustayne them that are to be created in it at once
45 And I sayd As thou didst say to thy seruant that quickening thou
didst quicken the creature created by thee at once and the creature
susteined it it may now also beare them present at once 46 And he
sayd to me Aske the matrice of a woman  thou shalt say to it And if
thou bring forth children why by times Aske it therfore that it geue
ten at once 47 And I sayd it can not verily but according to time
48 And he sayd to me And I haue geuen a matrice to the earth for them
that are sowen vpon it by time 49 For as the infant bringeth not forth
the thinges that perteyne to the aged so haue I disposed the world
created of me 50 And I asked and sayd Wheras thou hast now geuen me
a way I wil speake before thee for our mother of whom thou toldest
me yet she is yong now draweth nigh to old age 51 And he answered
me and sayd Aske her that beareth children and she wil tel thee
52 For thou shalt say to her Why are not they whom thou hast brought
forth now like to them that were before thee but lesse of stature
53 And she also wil say vnto thee They that are borne in the youth of
streingth are of one sort and they of an other that are borne about the
time of old age when the matrice fayleth 54 Consider therfore thou
also that you are of lesse stature then they that were before you
55 and they that are after you of lesser then you as it were creatures
now waxing old and past the strength of youth 56 And I sayd I besech
thee Lord if I haue found grace before thine eyes shew vnto thy
seruant by whom thou doest visite thy creature



CHAP VI


God knowing al thinges before they were made created them 54 for man
and considerth the endes of al

AND he sayd to me In the beginning of the earthlie world and before
the endes of the world stood and before the congregation of the windes
did blow Prov 8 2 and before the voyces of thunders sounded  before
the flashinges of lightenings shined and before the fundations of
paradise were confirmed 3 and before beautiful flowers were sene and
before the moued powers were established and before the innumerable
hostes of Angels were gathered 4 and before the heightes of the ayre
were aduanced and before the measures of the firmaments were named and
before the chymneies were hote in Sion 5 and before the present yeares
were searched out and before their inuentions that now sinne were put
away and they signed that made fayth their treasure 6 then I thought
and they were made by me only and not by any other and the end by me
and not by any other 7 And I answered and sayd What separation of
times shal there be and when shal the end of the former be and the
begynning of that which foloweth 8 And he sayd to me from Abraham vnto
Isaac when Iacob and Esau were borne of him the hand of Iacob held from
the begynning the heele of Esau 9 for the end of this world is Esau and
the begynning of the next Iacob 10 The hand of a man betwen the heele
and the hand Aske no other thing Esdras 11 And I answered and sayd
O Lord dominatour if I haue found grace before thyne eyes 12 I pray
thee shew thy seruant the end of thy signes wherof thou didst shew me
part the night before 13 And he answered and sayd to me Arise vpon
thy feete and heare a voice most ful of sound 14 And it shal be as it
were a commotion neither shal the place be moued wherin thou standest
15 Therfore when it speaketh be not thou afrayd because of the end is
the word and the fundation of the earth vnderstood 16 for concerning
them the word trembleth and is moued for it knoweth that their end must
be changed 17 And it came to passe when I had heard I rose vpon my
feete and I heard and behold a voice speaking and the sound therof as
the sound of manie waters 18 and it sayd Behold the dayes come and
the time shal be when I wil begyne to approch that I may visite the
inhabitantes vpon the earth 19 And when I wil begin to enquire of them
that vniustly haue hurt with their iniustice and when the humilitie of
Sion shal be accomplished 20 And when the world shal be ouersigned that
shal beginne to passe I wil doe these signes Bookes shal be opened
before the face of the firmament and al shal see together 21 and
infantes of one yeare shal speake with their voices  wemen with child
shal bring forth vntimely infantes not ripe of three or foure monethes
and shal liue and shal be raysed vp 22 And sodenly shal appeare sowen
places not sowen  ful cellers shal sodenly be found emptie 23 and a
trumpet shal sound which when al shal heare they wil sodenly be afrayd
24 And it shal be in that time freindes as enimies shal ouerthrow
freindes and the earth shal be afrayd with them  the vaynes of
fountaynes shal stand and shal not runne in three howres 25 and it
shal be euerie one that shal be leaft of al these of whom I haue
foretold thee he shal be saued and shal see my saluation  the end of
your world 26 And the men that are receiued shal see they that tasted
not death from their natiuitie and the hart of the inhabitantes shal be
turned into an other sense 27 For euil shal be put out and deceite
shal be extinguished 28 but fayth shal florish and corruption shal be
ouercome and truth shal be shewed which was without fruite so manie
dayes 29 And it came to passe when he spake to me  I loe by litle 
litle looked on him before whom I stood 30 and he sayd to me these
wordes I am come to shew thee the time of the night to come 31 If
therfore thou pray agayne and fast agayne seuen dayes agayne I wil tel
thee greater thinges by the day which I haue heard 32 For thy voice is
heard before the Highest For the strong hath sene thy direction and
hath fore sene the chastitie which thou hast had from thy youth 33 and
for this cause he hath sent me to shew thee al these thinges and to say
to thee haue confidence and feare not 34 and hasten not with the
former times to thinke vayne thinges that thou hasten not from the last
times 35 And it came to passe after these thinges and I wept againe
and in like maner I fasted seuen dayes to accomplish the three weekes
that were told me 36 And it came to passe in the eight night and my
hart was trubled againe in me and I began to speake before the Highest
37 For my spirit was inflamed excedingly and my soul was distressed
38 And I sayd O Lord speaking thou didst speake from the beginning of
creature from the first day saying Let heauen be made and earth and
thy word was a perfect worke 39 And then there was spirit and
darknesse was caried about and silence the sound of the voyce of man
was not yet from thee 40 Then thou didst command the lighsome light to
be brought forth of thy treasures wherby thy worke might appeare
41 And in the second day thou didst create the spirit of the firmament
and commandest it to diuide and to make a diuision betwen the waters
that a certayn part should depart vpward and part should remaine beneth
42 And in the third day thou didst command the waters to be gathered
together in the seuenth part of the earth but sixe partes thou didst
drie and preserue that of them might be seruing before thee thinges
sowen of God and tilled 43 For thy word proceded and the worke forth
with was made 44 For sodenly came forth fruite of multitude infinite
and diurse tastes of concupiscence and flowers of vnchangeable colour
and odours of vnsearcheable smel and in the third day these thinges were
made 45 And in the fourth day thou didst command to be made the
brightnesse of the sunne the light of the moone the disposition of the
starres 46 and didst command them that they should serue man that
should be made 47 And in the fifth day thou saydst to the seuenth
part where the water was gathered together that it should bring forth
beastes and foules and fishes and so was it done 48 the dumme water
and without life the thinges that by Gods appointement were commanded
made beastes that therby the nations may declare thy meruelous workes
49 And then thou didst preserue two soules the name of one thou didst
cal Henoch and the name of the second thou didst cal Leuiathan 50 and
thou didst separate them from eche other For the seuenth part where
the water was gathered together could not hold them 51 And thou gauest
to Henoch one part which was dried the third day to dwelt therin where
are a thousand mountaynes 52 But to Leuiathan thou gauest the seuenth
part being moyst and kepst it that it might be to deuoure whom thou
wilt and when thou wilt 53 And in the sixt day thou didst command the
earth to create before thee cattel and beastes and creeping creatures
54 and ouer these Adam whom thou madest ruler ouer al the workes which
thou didst make  out of him are al we brought forth and the people
whom thou hast chosen 55 And al these thinges I haue sayd before thee o
Lord because thou didst create the world for vs 56 But the residue of
the nations borne of Adam thou saydst that they were nothing and that
they were like to spittle and as it were the droping out of a vessel
thou didst liken the abundance of them 57 And now Lord behold these
nations which are reputed for nothing haue begune to rule ouer vs and
to deuoure vs 58 but we thy people whom thou didst cal thy first onlie
begotten emulatour are deliuered into their handes 59 and if the world
was created for vs why doe not we possesse inheritance with the world
how long these thinges



CHAP VII


Without tribulations no man can attayne immortal life 17 which the
iust shal inherite and the wicked shal perish 28 Christ wil come
and dye for mankind 36 Prayers of the iust shal profite til the end of
this world but not after the general iudgement 48 Al sinned in Adam
52 and haue added more sinnes 57 but it is in mans powre 62 by Gods
grace to liue eternally

AND it came to passe when I had ended to speake these wordes the Angel
was sent to me which had bene sent to me the first nights 2 and he sayd
to me Arise Esdras and heare the wordes which I am come to speake to
thee 3 And I sayd Speake my God And he sayd to me The sea is set
in a large place that it might be deepe and wide 4 but the entrance to
it shal be set in a straict place that it might be like to riuers
5 For who witting wil enter into the sea and see it or rule ouer it
if he passe not the streite how shal he come into the bredth 6 Also an
other thing A citie is built and set in a plaine place and it is ful
of al goodes 7 The entrance therof narrow and set in a stepe place so
that on the right hand there was fire  on the left depe water 8 and
there is one onlie pathe set betwen them that is betwen the fire and
the water so that the pathe can not conteyne but onlie a mans steppe
9 And if the citie shal be geuen a man for inheritance if he neuer passe
through the peril set before it how shal he receiue his inhertance
10 And I sayd So Lord And he sayd to me So it is Israel also a
part 11 For I made the world for them and when Adam transgressed my
constitution that was iudged which was done 12 And the entrance of
this world were made streite and sorowful  paynful and few and euil
and ful of dangers  stuffed very much with labour 13 For the
entrances of the greater world are large andsecure and making fruite of
immortalitie 14 If then they that liue entring in enter into these
streite and vayne thinges they can not receiue the thinges that are
layd vp 15 Now therfore why art thou trubled wheras thou art
corruptible and why art thou moued wheras thou art mortal 16 And why
hast thou not taken in thy hart that which is to come but that which is
present 17 I answered and sayd Lord dominatour behold thou hast
disposed by thy law that the iust shal inherite these thinges and the
impious shal perish Deut 8 18 But the iust shal suffer the streites
hoping for the wyde places for they that haue done impiously haue both
suffered the streites and shal not see the wide places 19 And he sayd
to me There is no iudge aboue God nor that vnderstandeth aboue the
Highest 20 For manie present doe perish because the law of God which
was set before is neglected 21 For God commanding commanded them that
came when they came what doing they should liue and what obseruing
they should not be punished 22 But they were not perswaded and
gaynesayd him and made to them selues a cogitation of vanitie 23 and
proposed to them selues deceites of sinnes  they sayd to the Highest
that he was not and they knew not his wayes 24 and dispised his law
and denyed his couenaunces and had not fidelitie in his ordinances and
did not accomplish his workes 25 For this cause Esdras the emptie to
the emptie and the ful to the ful 26 Behold the time shal come and it
shal be when the signes shal come which I haue foretold thee and the
bride shal appeare and appearing she shal be shewed that now is hid with
the earth 27 and euerie one that is deliuered from the foresaid euils
he shal see my meruelous thinges 28 For my sonne IESVS shal be reueled
with them that are with him and they shal be merie that are leaft in the
foure hundred yeares 29 And it shal be after these yeares and my sonne
CHRIST shal dye and al men that haue breath 30 and the world shal be
turned into the old silence seuen dayes as in the former iudgementes so
that none shal be leaft 31 And it shal be after seuen dayes and the
world shal be raysed vp that yet waketh not and shal dye corrupted
32 and the earth shal render the thinges that sleepe in it  the dust
them that dwel in it with silence and the cellars shal render the soules
that are commended to them 33 And the Highest shal be reueled vpon the
seate of iudgement and miseries shal passe and long sufferance shal be
gathered together 34 And iudgement onlie shal remayne truth shal
stand and fayth shal waxe strong 35 and the worke shal folow and the
reward shal be shewed and iustice shal awake and iniustice shal not
haue dominion See note below 36 And I sayd First Abraham prayed
for the Sodomites and Moyses for the fathers that sinned in the desert
Gen 18  Ex 32 37 And they that were after him for Isreal in the dayes
of Achaz and of Samuel 38 and Dauid for the destruction and Salomon
for them that came vnto the sanctification 2 Kings 2417  2 Par 613
39 And Elias for them that receiued raine and for the dead that he might
liue 3 Kings 17  18 40 and Ezechias for the people in the dayes of
Sennacherib and manie for manie 4 Kings 1915 41 If therfore now
when corruptible did increase and iniustice was multiplied and the iust
prayed for the impious why now also shal it not be so 42 And he
answered me and sayd This present world is not the end much glorie
remaineth in it for this cause they prayed for the impotent 43 For
the day of iudgement shal be the end of this time and the beginning of
the immortalitie to come wherein corruption is past 44 intemperance is
dissolued incredulitie is cut of and iustice hath increased truth is
strong 45 For then no man can saue him that hath perished nor drowne
him that hath ouercome And I answered 46 and sayd This is my word
the first and the last that it had bene better not to geue the earth to
Adam or when he had now geuen it to restraine him that he should not
sinne 47 For what doth it profit men presently to liue in sorow and
being dead to hope for punishment 48 O what hast thou done Adam For
if thou didst sinne it was not made thy fal only but ours also which
came of thee Rom 512 49 For what doth it profit vs if immortal time
be promised to vs but we haue done mortal workes 50 And that
euerlasting hope is foretold vs but we most wicked are become vayne
51 And that habitations of health and securitie are reserued for vs but
we haue conuerst naughtely 52 And that the glorie of the Highest is
reserued to protect them that haue slowly conuerst but we haue walked
in most wicked wayes 53 And that paradise shal be shewed whose fruite
continueth incorrupted wherin is securitie and remedie 54 but we shal
not enter in for we haue conuerst in vnlawful places 55 And their
faces which haue had abstinence shal shyne aboue the starres but our
faces blacke aboue darkenes 56 For we did not thinke liuing when we
did iniquitie that we shal beginne after death to suffer 57 And he
answered and sayd This is the cogitation of the battel which man shal
fight who is borne vpon the earth 58 that if he shal be ouercome he
suffer that which thou hast sayd but if he ouercome he shal receiue
that which I say 59 for this is the life which Moyses spake of when he
liued to the people saying Choose vnto thee life that thou mayst
liue Deut 3019 60 But they beleued him not no nor the Prophetes
after him no nor me which haue spoken to them 61 Because there should
not be sorow vnto their perdition as there shal be ioy vpon them to
whom saluation is perswaded 62 And I answered and sayd I know Lord
that the Highest is called merciful in that that he hath mercie on them
which are not yet come into the world 63 and that he hath mercie on them
which conuerse in his law 64 and he is long suffering because he
sheweth long sufferance to them that haue sinned as it were with their
owne workes 65 and he is bountiful because he wil geue according to
exigentes 66 and of freat mercie because he multiplieth more mercies
to them that are present and that are past and that are to come
67 For if he shal not multiplie his mercies the world shal not be made
aliue with them that did inherite it 68 And he geueth for if he shal
not geue of his bountie that they may be releeued which haue done
iniquitie the tenth thousand part of men can not be quickned from their
iniquities 69 And the iudge if he shal not forgeue them that are cured
with his word and wype away a multitude of contentions there should
not perhaps be leaft in an innumerable multitiude but very few



CHAP VIII


God is merciful in this world yet fewe are saued 6 Gods workes and
disposition of his creatures are meruelous 15 Esdras prayeth for the
people of Israel 37 and saluation is promised to the iust and
punishment threatned to the wicked

AND he answered me  sayd This world the Highest made for manie but
that to come for few 2 And I wil speake a similitude Esdras before
thee For as thou shalt aske the earth and it wil tel thee that it wil
geue much more earth wherof earthen worke may be made but a litle dust
wherof gold is made so also is the act of this present world 3 Manie
in deede are created but few shal be saued Matt 2016 4 And I
answered and sayd Then o soul swallow vp the sense and deuoure that
which is wise 5 For thou art agred to obey and willing to prophecie
For there is no space geuen thee but only to liue 6 O Lord if thou wilt
not permitte thy seruant that we pray before thee and thou geue vs
seede to the hart and tillage to the vnderstanding wherof may the
fruite be made wherby euerie corrupt person may liue that shal beare
the place of a man 7 For thou art alone and we are one workmanshippe
of thy handes as thou hast spoken 8 and as now the bodie made in the
matrice and thou doest geue the members thy creature is preserued in
fire  water and nine monethes thy workemanship doth suffer thy
creature that is created in it 9 and it self that keepeth and that
which is kept both shal be preserued and the matrice being preserued
rendreth agayne at some time the thinges that are growen in it 10 For
thou hast commanded of the members that is the brestes to geue milke
vnto the fruite of the brestes 11 that the thing which is made may be
nourished til a certayne time and afterward thou mayst dispose him to
thy mercie 12 For thou hast brought him vp in thy iustice and hast
instructed him in thy law and hast corrected him in thy vnderstanding
13 and thou shalt mortifie him as thy creature and shalt geue him
life as thy worke 14 If then thou wilt destroy him that is made with
so great labours it is easie by thy commandment to be ordayned that
also which was made might be preserued 15 And now Lord I wil speake
of euerie man thou rather knowest but concerning thy people for which
I am sorowful 16 and concerning thine inheritance for which I mourne
and for Israel for whom I am pensiue and concerning Iacob for whom I am
sorowful 17 Therfore wil I begin to pray before thee for me  for
them because I see our defaultes that inhabite the earth 18 But I
haue heard of the celeritie of the iudge that shal be 19 Therfore heare
my voyce and vnderstand my word and I wil speake before thee 20 The
beginning of the wordes of Esdras before he was assumpted and I sayd
Lord which inhabitest the world whose eyes are eleuated vnto thinges on
high and in the ayre 21 and whose throne is inestimable and glorie
incomprehensible by whom standeth an host of Angels with trembling
22 whose keping is turned in wynde and fire thou whose word is true and
sayings premanent 23 whose commandment is strong and disposition
terrible whose looke dryeth vp the depthes and indignation maketh the
mountaynes to melt and truth doth testifie 24 Heare the prayer of thy
seruant  with thine eares receiue the petition of thy creature 25 For
whiles I liue I wil speake and whiles I vnderstand I wil answere
26 Neither doe thou respect the sinnes of thy people but them that serue
thee in truth 27 Neither doe thou attend the impious endeuours of the
nations but them that with sorowes haue kept thy testimonies
28 Neither thinke thou of them that in thy sight haue conuerst falsly
but remember them that according to thy wil haue knowen thy feare
29 Neither be thou willing to destroy them that haue had the maners of
beastes but respect them that haue taught thy law gloriously
30 Neither haue indignation towards them which are iudged worse then
beastes but loue them that alwayes haue confidence in thy iustice and
glorie 31 Because we and our fatheres languish with such diseases but
thou for sinners shalt be called merciful 32 For if thou shalt be
desirous to haue mercie on vs then thou shalt be called merciful to vs
hauing no workes of iustice 33 For the iust which haue manie workes
layd vp of their owne workes shal receiue reward 34 For what is man
that thou art angrie with him or the corruptible kinde that thou art
so bitter touching it 35 For in truth there is no man of them that be
borne which hath not done impiously and of them that confesse which
haue not sinned 3 Kings 846  2 Par 636 36 For in this shal thy
iustice be declared and thy goodnes o Lord when thou shalt haue mercie
on them that haue no substance of good workes 37 And he answered me
and sayd Thou hast spoken somethinges rightly and according to thy
wordes so also shal it be done 38 because I wil not in dede thinke vpon
the worke of them that haue sinned before death before the iudgement
before perdition 39 but I wil reioyce vpon the creature of the iust
and I wil remember their pilgrimage also and saluation and receiuing of
reward 40 Therfore as I haue spoken so also it is 41 For as the
husbandman soweth vpon the ground manie seedes and planteth manie
plantes but not al which were sowen in time are preserued nor yet al
that were planted shal take roote so they also that are sowen in the
world shal not al be saued Matt 13  20 42 And I answered and
sayd If I haue found grace let me speake 43 As the seede of the
husbandman if it come not vp or receiue not the rayne in time if it be
corupted with much rayne perisheth 44 so likewise also man who made
with thy handes and thou named his image because thou art likened to
him for whom thou hast made al thinges and hast likened him to the
seede of the husbandman 45 Be not angrie vpon vs but spare thy people
and haue mercie on thy inheritance And thou hast mercie on thy
creature 46 And he answered me and sayd The thinges that are present
to them that are present and that shal be to them that shal be 47 For
thou lackest much to be able to loue my creature aboue me and to thee
often times euen to thyselfe I haue approched but to the vniust neuer
48 But in this also thou art meruelous before the Highest 49 because
thou hast humbled thyself as becometh thee  hast not iudged thyself
that among the iust thou maist be very much glorified 50 For which
cause manie miseries and miserable thinges shal be done to them that
inhabite the world in the later dayes because they haue walked in much
pride 51 But thou for thyselfe vnderstand  for them that are like
vnto thee seeke glorie 52 For to you paradise is open the tree of life
is planted time to come is prepared abundance is prepared a citie is
builded rest is approued goodnes is perfited  perfit wisdome 53 The
roote of euil is signed from you infirmitie and mothe is hid from you
 corruption is fled into hel in obliuion 54 Sorowes are past  the
treasure of immortalitie is shewed in the end 55 Adde not therfore
inquiring of the multitude of them that perish 56 For they also
receiuing libertie haue despised the Highest and contemned his lawe
and forsaken his wayes 57 Yea and moreouer they haue troden downe his
iust ones 58 and haue sayd in their hart that there is no God and
that knowing that they dye Ps 13  52 59 For as the thinges
aforesayd shal receiue you so thirst and torment which are prepared
shal take them for he would not man to be destroyed 60 But they them
selues also which are created haue defyled his name which made them 
haue bene vnkind to him that prepared life 61 Wherfore my iudgement now
approcheth 62 Which thinges I haue not shewed to al but to thee  to
few like vnto thee And I answered and sayd 63 Behold now Lord thou
hast shewed me a multitude of signes which thou wilt beginne to doe in
the latter times but thou hast not shewed me at what time



CHAP IX


Certaine signes shal goe before the day of iudgement 14 More shal
perish then be saued 25 Prayer with other good workes are meanes to
saluation

AND he answered me and sayd Measuring measure thou the time in it
selfe and it shal be when thou seest after a certaine part of the
signes which are spoken of before shal passe 2 then shalt thou
vnderstand that the same is the time wherin the Highest wil beginne to
visite the world that was made by him 3 And when there shal be sene in
the world mouing of places and truble of peoples 4 then shalt thou
vnderstand that of these spake the Highest from the dayes that were
before thee from the beginning 5 For as al that is made in the world
hath a beginning and also a consummation and the consummation is
manifest 6 so also the times of the Highest haue the beginning manifest
in wonders and powers and the consummations in worke and in signes
7 And it shal be euery one that shal be saued and that can escape by
his workes and by fayth in which you haue beleeued 8 shal be leaft out
of the foresayd dangers and shal see my saluation in my land and in my
costes because I haue sancitifed my selfe from the world 9 And then
shal they be in miserie that now haue abused my wayes and they that
haue reiected them in contempt shal abide in torments 10 For they that
knew not me hauing obtained benefits when they liued 11 and they that
loathed my law when they yet had libertie 12 and when as yet place of
penance was open to them vnderstoode not but despised they must after
death in torment know it 13 Thou therfore be not yet curious how the
impious shal be tormented but inquire how the iust shal be saued and
whose the world is and for whom the world is and when 14 And I
answered and sayd 15 I haue spoken hertofore and now I say and
hereafter wil say that they are more which perish then that shal be
saued Matt 10 16 as a floud is multiplied aboue more then a droppe
17 And he ansvvered me and sayd Like as the field so also the sedes
and as the flovvers such also the colours and as the workeman such
also the worke and such as the husbandman such is the husbandrie
because it was the time of the world 18 And now when I was preparing
for them for these that now are before the world was made wherin they
should dwel and no man gaynsayd me 19 For then euery man and now the
creator in this world prepared and haruest not fayling and law
vnsearchable their manners are corrupted 20 And I considered the world
and behold there was danger because of the cogitations that came in it
21 And I saw and spared it very much and I kept vnto my selfe a grape
kernel of a cluster and a plant of a great trybe 22 Let the multitude
therfore perish which was borne without cause and let my kernel be
kept  my plant because I finished it with much labour 23 And thou
if thou adde yet seuen other dayes but thou shalt not fast in them
24 thou shalt goe into a field of flowers where no house is built 
thou shalt eate only of the flowers of the field and flesh thou shalt
not tast and wine thou shalt not drinke but only flowers 25 Pray to
the Highest without intermission and I wil come and wil speake with
thee 26 And I went forth as he sayd to me into a field which is
called Ardath and I sate there among the flowers And I did eate of the
herbes of the field and the meate of them made me ful 27 And it came
to passe after seuen dayes and I sate downe vpon the grasse and my hart
was trubled ayayne as before 28 And my mouth was opened and I beganne
to speake before the Highest and sayd 29 O Lord thou shewing thy selfe
to vs wast shewed to our fathers in the desert which is not troden and
vnfruitful when they came out of AEgypt and saying thou saydst
Ex 19  24  Deut 4 30 Thou Israel heare me and sede of Iacob attend
to my wordes 31 For behold I sow my lawe in you and it shal bring
forth fruite in you and you shal be glorified in it for euer 32 For
our fathers receiuing the law obserued it not and kept not my
ordinances and the fruite of the law did not appeare for it could not
because it was thine 33 For they that receiued it perished not
keeping that which had bene sowen in them Ex 32 34 And behold it is
the custome that when the earth hath receiued sede or the sea a shippe
or some vessel meate or drinke when that shal be destroyed wherin it
was sowne or into the which it was cast 35 that which was sowne or
cast in or the thinges that were receiued are destroyed withal and the
thinges receiued now tarye not with vs but it is not so done to vs
36 We in dede that receiued the law sinning haue perished and our hart
that receiued it 37 For the law hath not perished but hath remayned in
his labour Ezech 48 38 And when I spake these thinges in my hart I
looked backe with myne eyes and saw a woman on the right side and
behold she mourned and wept with a lowd voice and was sorrowful in
mynde exceedingly and her garments rent and ashes vpon her heade
39 And I left the cogitations wherin I was thinking and I turned to her
and sayd to her 40 Why weepest thou and why art thou sorie in mynde
And she sayd to me 41 Suffer me my Lord that I may lament myselfe 
adde sorrow because I am of a very pensiue mynde and am humbled
exceedingly 42 And I sayd to her What ayleth thee tel me And she
sayd to me 43 I thy seruant haue beene barren and haue not borne
childe hauing a husband thirty yeares 44 For I euery howre and euerie
day and these thirty yeares do beseche the Highest night and day
45 And it came to passe after thirtie yeares God heard me thy handmayd
and saw my humilitie and attended to my tribulation and gaue me a
sonne and I was very ioyful vpon him and my husband and al my
citizens and we did glorifie the Strong exceedingly 46 And I nourished
him with much labour 47 And it came to passe when he was growen and
came to take a wife I made a feast day



CHAP X


The state of Ierusalem is prefigured by a woman mourning 25 and
afterwardes reioycing

AND it came to passe when my sonne was entred into his inner chamber he
fel downe and dyed 2 and we al ouerthrewe the lights and al my
citizens rose vp to comfort me and I was quiet vntil the other day at
night 3 And it came to passe when al were quiet to comfort me that I
might be quiet and I arose in the night and fled and came as thou
seest into this field 4 And I meane nowe not to returne into the citie
but to stay here and neither eate nor drinke but without intermission
to mourne and to fast vntil I dye 5 And I left the talke wherin I was
and with anger answered her  sayd 6 Thou foole aboue al wemen seest
thou not our mourning  what thinges chance to vs 7 Because Sion our
mother is sorroweful with al sorrowe and humbled and mourneth most
bitterly 8 And now wheras we al mourne and are sadde wheras we are
sorrowful and art thou sorrowful for one sonne 9 For aske the earth
and it wil tel thee that it is she that ought to lament the fal of so
manie thinges that spring vpon it 10 And of her were al borne from the
beginning and others shal come and behold almost al walke into
perdition and the multitude of them commeth to destruction 11 And who
then ought to mourne more but she that hath lost so great a multitude
rather then thou which art sorie for one 12 And if thou say vnto me
that my mourning is not lyke the earthes because I haue lost the fruite
of my wombe which I bare with sorrowes and brought forth with paynes
13 but the earth according to the maner of the earth and the present
multitude in it hath departed as it came and I saye to thee 14 as thou
hast brought forth with payne so the earth also geueth her fruite for
man from the beginning to him that made her 15 Now therfore kepe in
with thy sorrowe and beare stoutly the chances that haue befallen thee
16 For if thou iustifie the end of God thou shalt in time both receiue
his counsel and also in such thinges thou shalt be praysed 17 Goe in
therfore into the citie to thy husband And she sayd to me 18 I wil
not doe it neither wil I enter into the citie but here wil I dye
19 And I added yet to speake to her  sayd 20 Doe not this word but
consent to him that counseleth thee For how manie are the chances of
Sion Take comfort for the sorrowe of Ierusalem 21 For thou seest that
our sanctification is made desert and our altar is throwen downe and
our temple is destroyed 22 and our psalter is humbled and hymne is
silent and our exultation is dissolued and the light of our
candelsticke is extinguished and the arke of our testament is taken for
spoyle  our holie thinges are contaminated and the name that is
inuocated vpon vs is almost prophaned and our children haue suffred
contumelie and our Priestes are burnt  our Leuites are gone into
captiuitie  our virgins are defloured and our wiues haue suffered
rape and our iust men are violently taken and our litle ones are lost
and our yong men are in bondage and our valiants are made impotent
23 and that which is greatest of al the seale of Sion because she is
vnsealed of her glorie For she is also deliuered into the handes of
them that hate vs 24 Thou therfore shake of thy great heauines and lay
away from thee the multitude of sorrowes that the Strong may be
propicious to thee agayne and the Highest wil geue thee rest rest from
thy labours 25 And it came to passe when I spake to her her face did
shine suddenly and her shape and her visage was made glistering so
that I was afrayde excedingly at her  thought what this thing should
be 26 And Behold suddenly she put forth a great sound of a voyce ful
of feare that the earth was moued at the womans sound And I saw
27 and behold the woman did no more appeare vnto me but a citie was
built  a place was shewed of great fundations and I was afrayd 
crying with a loude voyce I sayd 28 Where is Vriel the Angel that from
the beginning came to me for he made me come in multitude in excesse of
this minde and my end is made into corruption  my prayer into reproch
29 And when I was speaking these thinges behold he came to me and sawe
me 30 And behold I was layd as dead  my vnderstanding was alienated
and he held my right hand and strengthned me  set me vpon my feete 
sayd to me 31 What ayleth thee and why is thy vnderstanding and the
sense of thy hart trubled  why art thou trubled And I sayd
32 Because thou hast forsaken me and I in dede haue done according to
thy wordes  went out into the field  behold I haue seene  doe see
that which I cannot vtter And he sayd to me 33 Stand like a man  I
wil moue thee And I sayd 34 Speake thou my Lord in me forsake me
not that I die not in vaine 35 because I haue seene thinges that I
knew not  I doe heare thinges that I know not 36 Or is my sense
deceiued  doth my soule dreame 37 Now therfore I besech thee that
thou shew vnto thy seruant concerning this trance And he answered me 
sayd 38 Heare me and I wil teach thee and wil tel thee of what
thinges thou art afrayd because the Highest hath reuealed vnto thee
manie mysteries 39 He hath seene thy right way that without
intermission thou was forrowful for thy people and didst mourne
exceedingly for Sion 40 This therfore is the vnderstanding of the
vision which appeared to thee a litle before 41 The woman whom thou
sawest mourning thou beganst to comfort her 42 And now thou seest not
the forme of the woman but there appeared to thee a citie to be built
43 And because she tolde thee of the fal of her sonne this is the
interpretation 44 This woman which thou sawest she is Sion and wheras
she told thee of her whom now also thou shalt see as a citie builded
45 And whereas she told thee that she was barren thirtie yeares for
the which there were thirtie yeares when there was not yet oblation
offered in it 46 And it came to passe after thirtie yeares Salomon
built the citie and offered oblations then it was when the barren
bare a childe 47 And that which she sayd vnto thee that she nourished
him with labour this was the habitation in Ierusalem 48 And wheras she
sayd to thee that my sonne comming into the bryde chamber dyed and that
a fal chanced vnto him this was the ruine of Ierusalem that is made
49 And behold thou hast seene the similitude of her and because she
lamented her sonne thou beganst to comfort her and of these thinges
that haue chanced these were to be opened to thee 50 And now the
Highest seeth that thou wast sorie from the hart and because with thy
whole hart thou sufferest for her he hath shewed thee the clearnes of
her glorie and the fayrenes of her beautie 51 For therfore did he say
to thee that thou shouldest tarie in a field where house is not built
52 For I knew that the Highest beganne to shew thee these thinges
53 therfore I sayd vnto thee that thou shouldest goe into a field where
is no fundation of building 54 For the worke of mans building could not
be borne in the place where the citie of the Highest began to be shewed
55 Thou therfore feare not neither let thy hart dread but goe in and
see the beautie and greatnes of the building as much as the sight of
thyne eyes is capable to see 56  afterward thou shalt heare as much
as the hearing of thyne eares is capable to heare 57 For thou art
blessed aboue manie and art called with the Highest as few 58 And to
morrow night thou shalt tarie here 59 and the Highest wil shew thee
those visions of the thinges on high which the Highest wil doe to them
that inhabite vpon the earth in the later dayes 60 And I slept that
night and the other next as he had sayd to me



CHAP XI


An eagle appeareth to Esdras coming forth of the sea with three heades
and twelue winges sometimes one reigning in the world sometimes an
other but euerie one vanisheth away 36 A lion also appeareth coming
forth of the wood to suppresse the eagle

AND I sawe a dreame  behold an eagle came vp out of the sea which had
twelue winges of fethers and three heades 2 And I saw and behold she
spred her winges into al the earth and al the windes of heauen blew vpon
her and were gathered together 3 And I saw and of her fethers sprang
contrarie feathers and they became litle winges and smale 4 For her
heades were at rest and the midle head was greater then the other
heades but she rested with them 5 And I saw and behold the eagle flew
with her winges and reigned ouer the earth and ouer them that dwel in
it 6 And I saw that al thinges vnder heauen were subiect to her and
no man gaynesayd her no not one of the creature that is vpon the earth
7 And I saw and behold the eagle rose vp vpon her talons and made a
voice with her winges saying 8 Watch not al together sleepe euerie
one in his place  watch according to time 9 But let the heades be
preserued to the last 10 And I saw and behold the voice came not out
of her heades but from the middes of her bodie 11 And I numbered her
contrarie winges and behold they were eight 12 And I saw and behold
on the right side rose one wing and reighned ouer al the earth 13 And
it came to passe when it reigned an end came to it and the place
therof appeared not and the next rose vp  reigned that held much
time 14 And it came to passe when it reigned  the end of it also
came that it appeared not as the former 15 And behold a voice was
sent forth to it saying 16 Heare thou that hast held the earth of long
time Thus I tel thee before thou beginne not to appeare 17 None after
thee shal hold thy time no nor the halfe therof 18 And the third
lifted vp it selfe and held the principalitie as also the former and
that also appeared not 19 And so it chanced to al the other by one  by
one to haue the principalitie  agayne to appeare nowhere 20 And I
saw and behold in time the rest of the winges were sent vp on the right
side that they also might hold the principalitie and of them there
were that held it but yet forthwith they appeared not 21 For some also
of them stoode vp but they held not the principalitie 22 And I saw
after these thinges and behold the twelue winges and two litle winges
appeared not 23 and nothing remayned in the bodie of the eagle but two
heades resting and six litle winges 24 And I saw and behold from the
six litle winges two were diuided and they remayned vnder the head that
is on the right side For foure taried in their place 25 And I saw
and behold the vnderwinges thought to set vp them selues and to hold the
principalities 26 And I saw and behold one was set vp but forthwith
it appeared not 27 And they that were second did sooner vanish away
then the former 28 And I saw and behold the two that remayned thought
with them selues that they also would reigne 29 and when they were
thincking thereon behold one of the resting heades which was the midde
one awaked for this was greater then the other two heades 30 And I saw
that the two heades were complete with themselues 31 And behold the
head with them that were with him turned and did eate the two
vnderwinges that thought to reigne 32 And this head terrified al the
earth  ruled in it ouer them that inhabite the earth with much labour
and he that held the dominion of the whole world aboue al the winges that
were 33 And I saw after these thinges and behold the midle head
sodenly appeared not as did the winges 34 And there remained two
heads which reigned also themselues ouer the earth and ouer them that
dwelt therein 35 And I saw and behold the head on the right side
deuoured that which was on the left 36 And I heard a voice saying to
me Looke against thee and consider what thou seest 37 And I saw 
behold as a lion raysed out of the wood roaring and I saw that he sent
out a mans voyce to the eagle And he spake saying 38 Heare thou and
I wil speake to thee and the Highest wil say to thee 39 Is it not thou
that hast ouercome of the foure beastes which I made to reigne in my
world and that by them the end of their times might come 40 And the
fourth coming ouercame al the beastes that were past and by might held
the world with much feare and al the world with most wicked laboure and
he inhabitied the whole earth so long time with deceipte 41 And thou
hast iudged the earth not with truth 42 For thou hast afflicted the
meeke and hast trubled them that were quiet and hast loued lyers 
hast destroyed their habitations that did fructifie and hast ouerthrowen
their walles that did not hurt thee 43 And thy contumelie is ascended
euen to the Highest and thy pride to the Strong 44 And the Highest
hath looked vpon the proud times and behold they are ended and the
abominations therof are accomplished 45 Therfore thou eagle appeare no
more and thy horrible winges  thy litle winges most wicked and thy
heades malignant and thy talons most wicked and al thy bodie vayne
46 that al the earth may be refreshed and may returne deliuered from thy
violence and may hope for his iudgement and mercie that made it



CHAP XII


The eagle vanisheth away 5 Esdras prayeth 10 and the former visions
are declared to him

AND it came to passe whiles the lyon spake these wordes to the eagle I
saw 2 and behold the head that had ouercome and those foure winges
appeared not which passed to him and were set vp to reigne and their
reigne was smal and ful of tumult 3 And I saw and behold they
appeared not and al the bodie of the eagle was burnt  the earth was
afrayd excedingly and I by the tumult and traunce of minde and for
great feare awaked and sayd to my spirit 4 Behold thou hast geuen me
this in that that thou searchest the wayes of the Highest 5 Behold
yet I am wearie in minde and in my spirit I am very feeble and there is
not so much as a litle strength in me for the great feare that I was
afrayd of this night 6 Now therfore I wil pray the Highest that he
strengthen me euen to the end 7 And I sayd Lord Dominatour if I haue
found grace before thine eyes and if I am iustified before thee aboue
manie and if in deede my prayer be ascended before thy face
8 strengthen me and shew vnto me thy seruant the interpretation and
distinction of this horrible vision that thou mayst comfort my soule
most fully 9 For thou hast counted me worthie to shew vnto me the later
times And he sayd to me 10 This is the interpretation of this vision
11 The eagle which thou sawest coming vp from the sea this is the
kingdom which was sene in a vision to Daniel thy brother Dan 77
12 But it was not interpreted to him therfore I do now interprete it to
thee 13 Behold the dayes come and there shal rise a kingdon vpon the
earth and the feare shal be more terrible then of al the kingdomes that
were before it 14 And there shal twelue kinges reigne in it one after
an other 15 For the second shal beginne to reigne and he shal continew
more time then the rest of the twelue 16 This is the interpretation of
the twelue winges which thou sawest 17 And the voice that spake which
thou heardst not coming forth of her heads but from the middes of her
bodie 18 this is the interpretation that after the time of that kingdom
shal rise no smal contentions and it shal be in danger to fal and it
shal not fal then but shal be constituted againe according to the
beginning therof 19 And wheras thou sawest eight vnderwings cleauing to
the wings therof 20 this is the interpretation eight kinges shal arise
in it whose times shal be light and yeares swift and two of them shal
perish 21 But when the middest time approcheth foure shal be kept til
a time when the time therof shal beginne to approch to be ended yet two
shal be kept to the end 22 And wheras thou sawest three heads resting
23 this is the interpretation in her last dayes the Highest wil rayse
vp three kingdoms and wil cal backe manie thinges into them and they
shal rule ouer the earth 24 and them that dwel in it with much labour
aboue al them that vvere before them For this cause they are called the
heads of the eagle 25 For these shal be they that shal recapitulate her
impieties and that shal accomplish her last thinges 26 And wheras thou
sawest a greater head not appearing this is the interpretation therof
that one of them shal dye vpon his bed and yet with torments 27 For
the two that shal remayne the sword shal eate them 28 For the sword of
one shal deuoure him that is with him but yet this also at the last
shal fal by the sword 29 And wheras thou sawest two vnderwings passing
ouer the head that is on the right side 30 this is the interpretation
these are they whom the Highest hath kept to their end this is a smal
kingdom and ful of truble 31 As thou sawest the lyon also whom thou
sawest awaking out of the wood and roaring and speaking to the eagle
and rebuking her and her iniustices by al his wordes as thou hast heard
32 this is the wynde which the Highest hath kept vnto the end for them
and their impieties and he shal rebuke them and shal cast in their
spoyles before them 33 For he shal sette them in iudgment aliue and
it shal be when he hath reproued them then shal he chastise them
34 For the rest of my people he shal deliuer with miserie them that are
saued vpon my borders and he shal make them ioyful til the end shal
come the day of iudgment wherof I haue spoken to thee from the
beginning 35 This is the dreame which thou sawest and these be the
interpretations 36 Thou therfore only hast bene worthie to know this
secrete of the Highest 37 Write therfore in a booke al these thinges
which thou hast sene and put them in a hidden place 38 and thou shalt
teach them the wise men of thy people whose harts thou knowest able to
take and to kepe these secretes 39 But doe thou stay here yet other
seuen dayes that there may be shewed thee whatsoeuer shal seme good to
the Highest to shew thee 40 And he departed from me And it came to
passe when al the people had heard that the seuen dayes were past and I
had not returned into the citie and al gathered them selues together
from the least vnto the greatest  came to me  spake to me saying
41 What haue we sinned to thee or what haue we done vniustly against
thee that leauing vs thou hast sitten in this place 42 For thou alone
art remayning to vs of al peoples as a cluster of grapes of the
vineyard and as a candle in a darke place and as an hauen and shippe
saued from the tempest 43 Or are not the euiles that chance sufficient
for vs 44 If then thou shalt forsake vs how much better had it bene to
vs if we also had bene burnt with the burning of Sion 45 For we are
not better then they that dyed there And they wept with a lowd voice
And I answered them and sayd 46 Be of good chere Israel and be not
sorowful thou house of Iacob 47 For there is remebrance of you before
the Highest and the Strong hath not forgotten you in tentation 48 For
I haue not forsaken you neither did I depart form you but I came into
this place to pray for the desolation of Sion and to seeke mercie for
the low estate of your sanctification 49 And now goe euery one of you
into his house and I wil come to you after these dayes 50 And the
people departed as I sayd to them into the citie 51 but I sate in the
fielde seuen dayes as he commanded me and I did eate of the flowers of
the field only of the herbes was my meate made in those dayes



CHAP XIII


A vision of a winde as it first semed but in dede v 3 of a man
5 strong against the enimies 21 with the interpretation

AND it came to passe after seuen dayse and I dreamed a dreame in the
night 2 And behold there rose a winde from the sea that trubled al the
waues therof 3 And I saw and behold that man grew strong with
thousandes of heauen and when he turned his countenance to consider al
thinges trembled that were sene vnder him 4 and whersoeuer voyce
proceded out of his mouth al that heard his voices begane to burne as
the earth is quiet when it feeleth the fire 5 And I saw after these
and behold a multitude of men was gathered together of whom there was no
number from the foure windes of heauen to fight against the man that
was come vp out of the sea 6 And I saw and behold he had grauen to
himself a great mountaine  he flew vpon it 7 And I sought to see the
countrie or the place whence the mountaine was grauen  I could not
8 And after these thinges I saw and behold al that were gathered to him
to ouerthrowe him feared exceedingly yet they were bold to fieght
9 And behold as he sawe the violence of the multitude that came he
lifted not vp his hand nor held sword nor anie warlyke instrument but
only as I saw 10 that he sent forth out of his mouth as it were a blaste
of fire and from his lippes a spirit of flame  from his tongue he
sentforth sparkles  tempests and al thinges were mingled together with
this blast of fire  spirit of flame  multitude of tempests 11 And
it fel with violence vpon the multitude that was prepared to fight and
burned them al that suddenly there was nothing sene of an innumerable
multitude but only dust  the sauour of smoke and I saw and was
afrayd 12 And after these thinges I saw the man himself descending from
the mountaine and calling to him an other peaceable multitude 13 and
there came to him the countenance of manie men some reioycing and some
sorrowing and some bond some bringing of them them that were offered
And I was sicke for much feare and awaked and sayd 14 Thou from the
beginning hast shewed thy seruant these meruelous thinges and hast
counted me worthie that thou wouldest receiue my petition 15 And now
shew me yet the interpretation of this dreame 16 For as I thinke in my
iudgement woe to them that were leaft in those dayes  much more woe
to them that were not leaft 17 For they that were not leaft were
sorrowful 18 I vnderstand now what thinges are layde vp in the later
dayes and they shal happen to them yea and to them that are leaft
19 For therefore they came into great dangers and manie necessities as
these dreames do shew 20 But yet it is easier aduenturing to come into
it then to passe as a cloud from the world and vow to see the thinges
that happen in the later time And he answered me and sayd 21 Both
the interpretation of the vision I wil tel thee and also concerning the
thinges that thou hast spoken I wil open to thee 22 Wheras thou
speakest of them that were leaft this is the interpretation 23 He that
taketh away danger at that time he hath garded himself They that haue
fallen into danger these are they that haue workes and fayth in the
Strongest 24 Know therefore that they are more blessed which are leaft
then they that are dead 25 These are the interpretations of the vision
wheras thou sawest a man coming from the hart of the sea 26 the same is
he whom the Highest preserueth much time which by himself shal deliuer
his creature and he shal dispose them that are leaft 27 And wheras
thou sawest proceede out of his mouth as it were winde and fire and
tempest 28 and wheras he held no sworde nor warlike instrument for
his violence destroyed the multitude that came to ouerthrow him this is
the interpretation 29 Behold the dayes come when the Highest shal
begin to deliuer them that are vpon the earth 30 and he shal come in
excesse of minde vpon them that inhabit the earth 31 And one shal
thinke to ouerthrow an other one citie an other citie one place an
other place and nation against nation and kingdom against kingdom
Matt 24  Luke 21 32 And it shal be when these thinges shal come to
passe and the signes shal happen which I shewed thee before and then
shal my sonne be reueled whom thou sawest as a man coming vp 33 And
it shal be when al nations shal heare his voice and euery one in his
countrie shal leaue their warre that they haue toward each other
34 and an innumerable multitude shal be gathered in one as willing to
come to ouerthrow him 35 But he shal stand vpon the top of mount Sion
36 And Sion shal come and it shal be shewed to al prepared and builded
as thou sawest the mountaine to be grauen without handes 37 And the
same my sonne shal reproue the thinges that the gentils haue inuented
these their impieties which came nere to the tempest because of their
euil cogitaitons and torments wherewith they shal begin to be tormented
38 Which were likened to the flame and he shal destroy them without
labour by the law that was likened to the fyre 39 And wheras thou
sawest him gathering vnto him an other peaceable multitude 40 These are
the ten tribes which were made captiue out of their land in the dayes of
Osee the King whom Salmanasar the King of the Assyrians led captiue
and he transported them beyond the riuer and they were transported into
an other land 4 Kings 17 41 But they gaue themselues this counsel
to forsake the multitude of nations and to goe forth into a farther
countrie where mankind neuer inhabited 42 Or there to obserue their
ordinances which they had not kept in their countrie 43 And they
entred in by the narrow entrances of the riuer Euphrates 44 For the
Highest then wrought them signes and stayed the vaines of the riuer til
they passed Ex 14  Jos 3 45 For by that countie was a great way to
goe of one yeare and a half for the countrie is called Arsareth
46 Then did they inhabite there til in the later time and now againe
when they beginne to come 47 againe the Highest shal stay the vaines of
the riuer that they may passe for these thou sawest a multitiude with
peace 48 But they also that were leaft of the people these are they
that be within my border 49 In shal come to passe therefore when he
shal begine to destroy the multitude of these nations that are gathered
he shal protect them that haue ouercome the people 50 and then shal he
shew them very manie wonders 51 And I sayd Lord dominatour shew me
this why I saw a man comming vp from the hart of the sea and he sayd to
me 52 As thou canst not either search these thinges or know what
thinges are in the depth of the sea so can not any man vpon the earth
see my sonne or them that are with him but in the time of a day
53 This is the interpretation of the dreame which thou sawest and for
the which thou only art here illuminated 54 For thou hast leaft thyne
owne law and hast bene occupied about my law and hast sought it
55 For thou hast disposed thy lyfe in wisdom and thyne vnderstanding
thou hast called mother 56 and for this I haue shewed thee riches with
the Highest For it shal be after other three dayes I wil speake other
thinges to thee and I wil expound to thee weightie and meruelous
thinges 57 And I went forth and passed into the fielde much
glorifying  praising the Highest for the meruelous thinges that he did
by time 58 And because he gouerneth it and the thinges that are
brought in times  I sate there three dayes

God appeareth in a bush 6 reuealing some thinges to be published and
some thinges to be hid 10 As the world waxeth old al thinges become
worse 27 The people of Israel are vngratful 32 Al shal be iudged in
the Resurrection according to their deedes

AND it came to passe the third day and I sate vnder an oke 2 And
behold a voice came forth against me out of a bush and sayd Esdras
Esdras and I sayd Loe here I am Lord And I arose vpon my feete
And he sayd to me 3 Reueling I was reueled vpon the bush and spake to
Moyses when the people serued in AEgypt Ex 3 4 and I sent him and
brought my people out of AEgypt and brought him vpon mount Sina  held
him with me manie dayes 5 And I told him manie meruelous thinges 
shewed him the secrets of times and the end and I commanded him
saying 6 These wordes thou shalt publish abroade and these thou shalt
hyde 7 And now to thee I say 8 The signes which I haue shewed and
the dreames which thou hast sene and the interpretations which thou hast
sene lay them vp in thy hart 9 For thou shalt be receiued of al thou
shalt be conuerted the residue with thy counsel and with the like to
thee til the times be finished 10 Because the world hath lost his
youth and the times draw nere to waxe old 11 For the world is diuided
by twelue partes  the tenth part  half of the tenth part are passed
12 and there remaineth hereafter the half of the tenth part 13 Now
therefore dispose thy house and correct thy people  comfort the humble
of them  forsake now corruption 14 and put from thee mortal
cogitations and cast from thee humane burdens and doe from thee now
infirme nature  lay at one side cogitations most trublesome to thee 
make speedie transmigration from these times 15 for the euiles which
thou hast sene to haue chanced now worse then these wil they doe againe
Matt 24  1 John 2 16 for looke how much the world shal become weake
by age so much shal euiles be multiplied vpon the inhabitants 17 For
truth hath remoued it self farther of and lying hath approched for now
the vision which thou sawest hasteneth to come 18 And I answered and
sayd before thee o Lord 19 For behold I wil goe as thou hast commanded
me  wil rebuke the people that now is But them that shal yet be born
who shal admonish 20 The world therfore is set in darknes and they
that dwel in it without light 21 Because thy law is burnt therefore no
man knowth the workes that haue bene done by thee or that shal begin
22 For if I haue found grace with thee send the Holie Ghost to me  I
wil write al that hath bene done in the world from the beginning the
thinges that were written in thy law that men may finde the pathe and
they that wil liue in the later times may liue 23 And he answered me
and sayd Goe gather together the people and thou shalt say to them
that they seeke thee not for fourtie dayes 24 And doe thou prepare thee
manie tables of boxe  take with thee Sarea Dabria Salemia Echanus
and Asiel these fiue which are readie to write sweeftly 25 And come
hither  I wil light in thy hart a candle of vnderstanding which shal
not be put out til the things be finished which thou shalt begine to
write 26 And then some thinges thou shalt open to the perfect some
thou shalt deliuer secretly to the wyse For to morrow this houre thou
shalt begine to write 27 And I went as he commanded me  gathered
together al the people and sayd 28 Heare Israel these wordes 29 Our
fathers were pilgrimes from the beginning in AEgypt and were deliuered
from thence Gen 47 30 And they receiued the law of life which they
kept not which you also after them haue transgressed Deut 4  Acts 7
31 and the land was geuen you by lotte and the land of Sion and your
fathers and you haue done iniquitie and haue not kept the wayes which
the Highest commanded you 32 And whereas he is a iust iudge he hath
taken from you in time that which he had geuen 33 And now you are here
and your brethren are among you 34 If then you wil rule ouer your
sense  instruct your hart you shal be preserued aliue and after death
shal obtaine mercie 35 For the iudgement shal come after death when we
shal returne to lyfe againe and then the names of the iust shal
appeare and the dedes of the impious shal be shewed 36 Let no man
therfore come to me now nor aske for me vntil fourtie dayes 37 And I
tooke the fiue men as he commandede me and we went forth into the
field and taried there 38 And I was come to the morrow  behold as
voice called me saying Esdras open thy mouth and drinke that which I
wil geue thee to drinke Ezech 3 39 And I opened my mouth  behold a
ful cuppe was brought me this was ful as it were with water but the
colour therof like as fire 40 And I tooke it and dranke and when I
had drunken of it my hart was tormented with vnderstanding and wisdome
grewe into my brest For my spirit was kept by memorie 41 And my mouth
was opened and was shut no more 42 The Highest gaue vnderstanding vnto
the fiue men and they wrote excesses of the night which were spoken
which they knewe not 43 And at night they did eate breade but I spake
by day  by night held not my peace 44 And there were written in the
fourtie dayes two hundred foure bookes 45 And it came to passe when
they had ended the fourtie daies the Highest spake saying 46 The
former thinges which thou hast written set abrode and let the worthie
and vnworthiereade but the last seuentie bookes thou shalt keepe that
thou mayest deliuer them to the wyse of thy people 47 For in these is
the vaine of vnderstanding and the fountaine of wisdome and the streame
of knowledge and I did soe

Esdras is bid to denounce that assuredly manie euiles wil come to the
world 9 God wil protect his people the wicked shal be punished and
lament their final miseries God reuenging for the good

BEHOLD speake into the eares of my people the wordes of prophecie which
I shal put into thy mouth sayth our Lord 2 and see that they be
written in paper because they be faithful and true 3 Be not afrayd of
the cogitations against thee neither let the incredulities truble thee
of them that speake 4 Because euerie incredulous person shal dye in his
incredulitie 5 Behold I bring in sayth our Lord vpon the whole earth
euils sword and famine and death and destruction 6 Because
iniquitie hath fully polluted ouer al the earth and their hurtful workes
are accomplished 7 Therefore sayth our Lord 8 I wil not now kepe
silence of their impieties which they doe irreligiously neither wil I
beare with those thinges which they practise vniustly Behold the
innocent  iust bloud crieth to me  the soules of the iust crie
continually 9 Reuenging I wil reuenge them sayth our Lord and I wil
take al innocent bloud out of them vnto me Apoc 610  192
10 Behold my people is led to slaughter as a flocke I wil no more suffer
it to dwel in the land of AEgypt 11 But I wil bring them forth in a
mightie hand and valiant arme and wil strike with plague as before and
wil corrupt al the land thereof 12 AEgypt shal mourne and fundations
thereof beaten with plague and with the chastisement which God wil bring
vpon it 13 The husbandmen that til the ground shal mourne because
their seedes shal perish by blasting and haile and by a terible starre
14 Woe to the world and them that dwel therein 15 Because the sword is
at hand and the destruction of them and nation shal rise vp against
nation to fight  sword in their handes Matt 24  Luke 21 16 For
there shal be instabilitie to men  growing one against an other they
shal not care for their king  the princes of the way of their doinges
in their might 17 For a man shal desire to go into the citie  can not
18 Because of their prides the cities shal be trubled the houses raised
the men shal feare 19 Man shal not pitie his neighbour to make their
houses nothing worth in the sword to spoyle their goodes for famine of
bread  much tribulation 20 Behold I cal together sayth God al the
kinges of the earth to feare me that are from the Orient  from the
South from the East  from Libanus to be turned vpon themselues and
to render the thinges that they haue geuen them 21 As they doe vntil
this day to myne elect so wil I doe and render in their bosome Thus
sayth our Lord God 22 My right hand shal not spare sinners neither
shal the sword cease vpon them that shede innocent bloud vpon the earth
23 Fire came forth from his wrath and hath deuoured the fundations of
the earth and sinners as it were straw set on fire 24 Woe to them that
sinne and obserue not my comandmentes sayth our Lord 25 I wil not
spare them depart o children from the powre Defile not my
sanctification 26 because the Lord knoweth al that sinne against him
therefore hath he deliuered them into death and into slaughter 27 For
now are euils come vpon the world and you shal tarrie in them For God
wil not deliuer you because you haue sinned against him 28 Behold an
horrible vision and the face of it from the east 29 And the nations of
dragons of Arabians shal come forth in manie chariots  as a winde the
number of them is caried vpon the earth so that now al doe feare and
tremble that shal heare them 30 the Carmonians madde for anger and
they shal goe forth as wild boares out of the wood  they shal come with
great power and shal stand in fight with them  they shal waste the
portion of the land of the Assirians 31 And after these thinges the
dragons shal preuaile mindful of their natiuitie and conspiring shal
turne themselues in great force to pursue them 32 These shal be trubled
and hold their peace at their force and shal turne their fete into
flight 33 And from the territorie of the Assirians the besiegers shal
beseige them and shal consume one of them and there shal be feare and
trembling in their armie and contention against their kinges 34 Behold
cloudes from the east and from the north vnto the south and their face
very horrible ful of wrath and storme 35 And they shal beate one
against an other and they shal beate downe manie starres and their
starre vpon the earth and bloud shal be from the sword vnto the bellie
36 And mans dung vnto the camels litter and there shal be much feare
and trembling vpon the earth 37 And they shal shake that shal see that
wrath and tremble shal take them and after these thinges there shal
manie showers be moued 38 from the south and the north and an other
portion from the weast 39 And the windes from the east shal reuaile
vpon it and shal shut it vp and the cloudes which he raised in wrath
and the starre to make terrour to the east winde and the west shal be
destroyed 40 And there shal be exalted great and mightie cloudes ful of
wrath and a starre to terrifie al the earth and the inhabitantes
therof and they shal powre in vpon euerie high and eminent place a
terrible starre 41 fire and haile and flying swordes and manie
waters so that al fildes also shal be filled and al riuers with the
fulnes of manie waters 42 And they shal throw downe cities and walles
and mountaines and hilles and the trees of the woodes and the grasse
of the medowes and their corne 43 And they shal passe constant vnto
Babylon and shal raise her Apoc 18 44 They shal come together
against her and shal compasse her and shal power out the starre and al
wrath vpon her and the dust and smoke shal goe vp euen into heauen and
round about shal lament her 45 And they that shal remaine vnder her
shal serue them that terified her 46 And thou Asia agreeing into the
hope of Babylon and the glorie of her person 47 woe be to thee thou
wretch because thou art like to her and hast adorned thy daughters in
fornication to please  glorie in thy louers which haue desired alwayes
to fornicate with thee 48 Thou hast imitated the odious in al her
workes and in her inuentions therefore sayth God 49 I wil send in
euils vpon thee widowhood pouertie and famine and sword and
pestilence to destroy thy houses by violation and death and glorie of
thy vertue 50 As a flower shal be withered when the heate shal rise
that is sent forth vpon thee 51 thou shalt be weakned as a litle poore
soule plaged and chastised of wemen that the mightie and the louers may
not receiue thee 52 Wil I be zealous against thee sayth our Lord
53 vnles thou hadst slayne myne elect at al times exalting the slaughter
of the handes and saying vpon their death when thou wast drunken
54 Adorne the beautie of thy countenance 55 The reward of thy
fornication is in thy bosome therefore thou shalt receiue recompence
56 As thou shalt doe to my elect sayth our Lord so shal God do to thee
and shal deliuer thee vnto euil 57 And thy children shal dye for
famine and thou shalt fal by the sword and thy cities shal be
destroyed  al thyne shal fal in the filde by the sword 58 And they
that are in the mountaines shal perish with famine and shal eate their
owne flesh  drinke bloud for the famine of bread and thirst of waters
59 Vnhappie by the seas shalt thou come and againe thou shalt receuie
euils 60 And in the passage they shal beate against the idle citie and
shal destroy some portion of thy land and shal deface part of thy
glorie againe returning to Babylon ourethrowen 61 And being throwen
downe thou shalt be to them for stubble and they shal be to thee fire
62 and deuoure thee and thy cities thy land and thy mountaynes al thy
woodes and fruitful trees they wil burne with fire 63 Thy children they
shal lead captiue  shal haue thy goodes for a praye and the glorie of
thy face they shal destroy



CHAP XVI


Al are admonished that extreme calamities shal fal vpon this world
36 the penitent returning to iustice shal escape 55  as al thinges
were made by Gods omnipotent powre at his wil so al thinges shal serue
to the reward of the blessed and punishment of the wicked

VVOE to thee Babylon  Asia woe to thee AEgypt and Syria 2 Gird
yourselues with sackclothes and shirtes of heare  mourne for your
children  be sorie because your destruction is at hand 3 The sword
is sent in vpon you and who is he that can turne it away 4 Fire is
sent in vpon you and who is he that can quench it 5 Euiles are sent in
vpon you and who is he that can repel them 6 Shal anie man repel the
lion being hungrie in the woode or quench the fire in stubble forthwith
when it beginneth to burne 7 Shal anie man repel the arrow shot of a
strong archer 8 Our strong Lord sendeth in euiles and who is he that
can repel them 9 Fire came forth from his wrath and who is he that can
quench it 10 He wil lighten who shal not feare he wil thunder and
who shal not be afrayed 11 Our Lord wil threaten and who shal not
vtterly be destroyed before his face 12 The earth hath trembled and
the fundations thereof the sea tosseth vp waues from the depth and the
floudes of it shal be destroyed and the fishes thereof at the face of
our Lord and at the glorie of his powre 13 because his right hand is
strong which bendeth the bow his arrowes be sharpe that are shot of him
they shal not misse when they shal begine to be shot into the endes of
the earth 14 Behold euiles are sent and they shal not returne til they
come vpon the earth 15 The fire is kindled and it shal not be quenched
til it consume the fundations of the earth 16 For as the arrow shot of
a strong archer returneth not so shal not the euils returne backe that
shal be sent vpon the earth 17 Woe is me woe is me who shal deliuer
me in those dayes 18 The beginning of sorrowes and much mourning the
beginning of famine and much destruction The beginning of warres and
the potestates shal feare the beginning of euiles and al shal tremble
19 In these what shal I doe when the euils shal come 20 Behold famine
and plague and tribulation and distresse are sent al as scourges for
amendment 21 and in al these they wil not conuert themselues from their
iniquities neither wil they be alwayes mindful of the scourges
22 Behold there shal be good cheape victuals vpon the earth so that
they may thinke that peace is directly coming toward them and then shal
euiles spring vpon the earth sword famine and great confusion 23 For
by famine manie that inhabit the earth shal dye and the sword shal
destroy the rest that remained aliue of the famine 24 and the dead shal
be cast forth as dung and there shal be none to comfort them For the
earth shal be left desert and the cities therof shal be throwen downe
25 There shal not be left a man to til the ground and to sow it 26 The
trees shal yeeld fruites and who shal gather them 27 The grape shal
become ripe  who shal tread it For there shal be great desolation to
places 28 For a man shal desire to see a man or to heare his voyce
29 For there shal be leaft ten of a citie and two of the field that haue
hid themselues in thicke woodes and cliffes of rockes 30 As there are
left in the oliuet and on euerie tree three of foure oliues 31 Or as
in a vinyeard when it is gathered there are grapes left by them that
diligently search the vineyard 32 so shal there be left in those dayes
three or foure by them that search their houses in the sword 33 And
the earth shal be left desolate and the fildes thereof shal waxe old 
the wayes thereof and al the pathes thereof shal bringforth thornes
because no man shal passe by it 34 Virgins shal mourne hauing no
bridegromes wemen shal mourne hauing no husbandes their daughters shal
mourne hauing no helpe 35 their bridegromes shal be consumed in battel
and their husbandes be destroyed in famine 36 But heare these thinges
and know them ye seruantes of our Lord 37 Behold the word of our Lord
receiue it beleue not the goddes of whom our Lord speaketh 38 Behold
the euiles approch and slacke not 39 As a woman with childe when shee
bringeth forth her child in the ninth moneth the houre of her
deliuerance approching two or three howres before paines come about her
wombe and the infants coming out of her wombe they wil not tarrie one
moment 40 So the euiles shal not slacke to come forth vpon the earth
and the world shal lament and sorowes shal hold it round about
41 Heare the word my people prepare yourselues vnto the fight  in
the euiles so be ye as strangers of the earth 42 He that selleth as if
he should flee and he that byeth as he that should lose it 43 He that
playeth the marchant as he that should take no fruite and he that
buildeth as he that should not inhabite 44 He that soweth as he that
shal not reape so he also that pruneth a vinyeard as if he should not
haue the vintage 45 They that marie so as if they should not get
children  they that marie not so as if were widowes 46 Wherfore they
that labour labour without cause 47 for foreners shal reape their
fruites  shal violently take their goodes and ouerthrow their houses
and lead theire children captiue because in captiuitie and famine they
beget their children 48 And they that play the marchantes by robrie
the longer they adorne their cities and houses and their possessions and
persons 49 so much the more wil I be zealous toward them vpon their
sinnes sayth our Lord 50 As a whore enuieth an honest  very good
woman 51 so shal iustice hate impietie when she adorneth herselfe and
accuseth her to her face when he shal come that may defend him that
searcheth out al vpon the earth 52 Therefore be not made like to her
nor to her workes 53 For yet a little whyle  iniquitie shal be taken
away from the earth  iustice shal reigne ouer you 54 Let not the
sinner say he hath not sinned because he shal burne coales of fire vpon
his head that sayth I haue not sinned before our Lord God and his
glorie 55 Behold our Lord shal know al the workes of men and their
inuentions  their cogitations and their hartes Eccli 23  Luke 16
56 For he sayd Let the earth be made and it was made let the heauen
be made  it was made Gen 1 57 And by his worde the starrs were
made  he noweth the number of the starres Ps 1464 58 Who
searcheth the depth and the treasures therof who hath measured the sea
 capacitie therof Job 38 59 Who hath shut vp the sea in the midest
of waters  hath hanged the earth vpon the waters with his word 60 Who
hath spred heauen as it were a vault ouer the waters he hath founded it
61 Who hath put fountaines of waters in the desert and lakes vpon the
toppes of mountaines to send forth riuers from the high rocke to watter
the earth 62 Who made man  put his hart in the midds of the bodie and
gaue him spirit life and vnderstanding 63 And the inspiration of God
omnipotent that made al thinges and searcheth al hid thinges in the
secretes of the earth 64 He knoweth your inuention and what you thinke
in your hartes sinning and willing to hide your sinnes 65 Wherfore our
Lord in searching hath searched al your workes and he wil put you al to
open shame 66 and you shal be confounded when your sinnes shal come
forth before men and the iniquities shal be they that shal stand
accusers in that day 67 What wil you doe or how shal you hide your
sinnes before God and his Angels 68 Behold God is the Iudge feare him
Cease from your sinnes and now forget your iniquities to doe them anie
more  God wil bring you out and deliuer you from al tribulation
69 For behold the heate of a great multitude is kindled ouer you and
they shal take certaine of you by violence  shal make the slaine to be
meate for idols 70 And they that shal consent vnto them shal be to
them in derision and in reproch and in conculcation 71 For there shal
be place against places and against the next cities great insurrection
vpon them that feare our Lord 72 They shal be as it were madde sparing
no bodie to spoyle and waste yet them that feare our Lord 73 because
they shal waste and spoyle the goodes and shal cast them out of their
houses 74 Then shal appeare the probation of mine elect as gold that
is proued by the fire 75 Heare be beloued sayth our Lord Behold the
dayes of tribulation are come and out of them I wil deliuer you
76 Doe not feare nor stagger because God is your guide 77 And he that
kepeth my commandmentes and precepts sayth our Lord God Let not your
sinnes ouerway you nor your inquities be aduanced ouer you 78 Woe to
them that are entangled with their sinnes and are couered with their
iniquities as a filde is entangled with the wood  the path therof
couered with thornes by which no man passeth  it is closed out  cast
to be deuoured of the fire

FINIS



Note This translation comes from the Latin text usually printed in an
appendix to editions of the Vulgate but these editions miss seventy
verses between 735 and 736 The missing fragment was discovered in a
Latin manuscript by Robert Lubbock Bensly in 1874 Below is a
translation of this fragment from a revised Authorized Version
Although often numbered 7367105 they are here number as A1A70 to
avoid any repetition in chapterverse designations

A1 And the pit of torment shall appear and over against it shall be
the place of rest and the furnace of hell shall be shewed and over
against it the paradise of delight
A2 And then shall the Most High say to the nations that are raised from
the dead See ye and understand whom ye have denied or whom ye have not
served or whose commandments ye have despised
A3 Look on this side and on that here is delight and rest and there
fire and torments Thus shall he speak unto them in the day of
judgement
A4 This is a day that hath neither sun nor moon nor stars
A5 neither cloud nor thunder nor lightning neither wind nor water
nor air neither darkness nor evening nor morning
A6 neither summer nor spring nor heat nor winter neither frost nor
cold nor hail nor rain nor dew
A7 neither noon nor night nor dawn neither shining nor brightness
nor light save only the splendour of the glory of the Most High whereby
all shall see the things that are set before them
A8 for it shall endure as it were a week of years
A9 This is my judgement and the ordinance thereof but to thee only
have I shewed these things
A10 And I answered I said even then O Lord and I say now Blessed
are they that be now alive and keep the statutes ordained of thee
A11 But as touching them for whom my prayer was made what shall I say
for who is there of them that be alive that hath not sinned and who of
the sons of men that hath not transgressed thy covenant
A12 And now I see that the world to come shall bring delight to few
but torments unto many
A13 For an evil heart hath grown up in us which hath led us astray
from these statutes and hath brought us into corruption and into the
ways of death hath shewed us the paths of perdition and removed us far
from life and that not a few only but well nigh all that have been
created
A14 And he answered me and said Hearken unto me and I will instruct
thee and I will admonish thee yet again
A15 for this cause the Most High hath not made one world but two
A16 For whereas thou hast said that the just are not many but few and
the ungodly abound hear the answer thereunto
A17 If thou have choice stones exceeding few wilt thou set for thee
over against them according to their number things of lead and clay
A18 And I say Lord how shall this be
A19 And he said unto me Not only this but ask the earth and she
shall tell thee intreat her and she shall declare unto thee
A20 For thou shalt say unto her Thou bringest forth gold and silver
and brass and iron also and lead and clay
A21 but silver is more abundant than gold and brass than silver and
iron than brass lead than iron and clay than lead
A22 Judge thou therefore which things are precious and to be desired
whatso is abundant or what is rare
A23 And I said O Lord that bearest rule that which is plentiful is of
less worth for that which is more rare is more precious
A24 And he answered me and said Weigh within thyself the things that
thou hast thought for he that hath what is hard to get rejoiceth over
him that hath what is plentiful
A25 So also is the judgement which I have promised for I will rejoice
over the few that shall be saved inasmuch as these are they that have
made my glory now to prevail and of whom my name is now named
A26 And I will not grieve over the multitude of them that perish for
these are they that are now like unto vapour and are become as flame and
smoke they are set on fire and burn hotly and are quenched
A27 And I answered and said O thou earth wherefore hast thou brought
forth if the mind is made out of dust like as all other created things
A28 For it were better that the dust itself had been unborn so that
the mind might not have been made therefrom
A29 But now the mind groweth with us and by reason of this we are
tormented because we perish and know it
A30 Let the race of men lament and the beasts of the field be glad let
all that are born lament but let the fourfooted beasts and the cattle
rejoice
A31 For it is far better with them than with us for they look not for
judgement neither do they know of torments or of salvation promised unto
them after death
A32 For what doth it profit us that we shall be preserved alive but
yet be afflicted with torment
A33 For all that are born are defiled with iniquities and are full of
sins and laden with offences
A34 and if after death we were not to come into judgement peradventure
it had been better for us
A35 And he answered me and said When the Most High made the world
and Adam and all them that came of him he first prepared the judgement
and the things that pertain unto the judgement
A36 And now understand from thine own words for thou hast said that
the mind groweth with us
A37 They therefore that dwell upon the earth shall be tormented for
this reason that having understanding they have wrought iniquity and
receiving commandments have not kept them and having obtained a law they
dealt unfaithfully with that which they received
A38 What then will they have to say in the judgement or how will they
answer in the last times
A39 For how great a time hath the Most High been longsuffering with
them that inhabit the world and not for their sakes but because of the
times which he hath foreordained
A40 And I answered and said If I have found grace in thy sight O
Lord shew this also unto thy servant whether after death even now when
every one of us giveth up his soul we shall be kept in rest until those
times come in which thou shalt renew the creation of whether we shall
be tormented forthwith
A41 And he answered me and said I will shew thee this also but join
not thyself with them that are scorners nor number thyself with them
that are tormented
A42 For thou hast a treasure of good works laid up with the Most High
but it shall not be shewed thee until the last times
A43 For concerning death the teaching is When the determinate
sentence hath gone forth from the Most High that a man should die as the
spirit leaveth the body to return again to him who gave it it adoreth
the glory of the Most High first of all
A44 And if it be one of those that have been scorners and have not kept
the way of the Most High and that have despised his law and that hate
them that fear God
A45 these spirits shall not enter into habitations but shall wander
and be in torments forthwith ever grieving and sad in seven ways
A46 The first way because they have despised the law of the Most High
A47 The second way because they cannot now make a good returning that
they may live
A48 The third way they shall see the reward laid up for them that have
believed the covenants of the Most High
A49 The fourth way they shall consider the torment laid up for
themselves in the last days
A50 The fifth way they shall see the dwelling places of the others
guarded by angels with great quietness
A51 The sixth way they shall see how forthwith some of them shall pass
into torment
A52 The seventh way which is more grievous than all the aforesaid
ways because they shall pine away in confusion and be consumed with
shame and shall be withered up by fears seeing the glory of the Most
High before whom they have sinned whilst living and before whom they
shall be judged in the last times
A53 Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most
High when they shall be separated from the corruptible vessel
A54 In the time that they dwelt therin they painfully served the Most
High and were in jeopardy every hour that they might keep the law of
the lawgiver perfectly
A55 Wherefore this is the teaching concerning them
A56 First of all they shall see with great joy the glory of him who
taketh them up for they shall have rest in seven orders
A57 The first order because they have striven with great labour to
overcome the evil thought which was fashioned together with them that it
might not lead them astray from life into death
A58 The second order because they see the perplexity in which the
souls of the ungodly wander and the punishment that awaiteth them
A59 The third order they see the witness which he that fashioned them
beareth concerning them that while they lived they kept the law which
was given them in trust
A60 The fourth order they understand the rest which being gathered in
their chambers they now enjoy with great quietness guarded by angels
and the glory that awaiteth them in the last days
A61 The fifth order they rejoice seeing how they have now escaped
from that which is corruptible and how they shall inherit that which is
to come while they see moreover the straitness and the painfulness from
which they have been delivered and the large room which they shall
receive with joy and immortality
A62 The sixth order when it is shewed unto them how their face shall
shine as the sun and how they shall be made like unto the light of the
stars being henceforth incorruptible
A63 The seventh order which is greater than all the aforesaid orders
because they shall rejoice with confidence and because they shall be
bold without confusion and shall be glad without fear for they hasten
to behold the face of him whom in their lifetime they served and from
whom they shall receive their reward in glory
A64 This is the order of the souls of the just as from henceforth is
announced unto them and aforesaid are the ways of torture which they
that would not give heed shall suffer from henceforth
A65 And I answered and said Shall time therefore be given unto the
souls after they are separated from the bodies that they may see that
whereof thou hast spoken unto me
A66 And he said Their freedom shall be for seven days that for seven
days they may see the things whereof thou hast been told and afterwards
they shall be gathered together in their habitations
A67 And I answered and said If I have found favour in thy sight shew
further unto me thy servant whether in the day of judgement the just will
be able to intercede for the ungodly or to intreat the Most High for
them
A68 whether fathers for children or children for parents or brethren
for brethren or kinsfolk for their next of kin or friends for them that
are most dear
A69 And he answered me and said Since thou hast found favour in my
sight I will shew thee this also The day of judgement is a day of
decision and displayeth unto all the seal of truth even as now a father
sendeth not his son or a son his father or a master his slave or a
friend him that is most dear that in his stead he may be sick or sleep
or eat or be healed
A70 so never shall any one pray for another in that day neither shall
one lay a burden on another for then shall all bear every one his own
righteousness or unrighteousness

THE PROPHECIE OF ABDIAS



ABDIAS borne in Sichem of the tribe Ephraim prophecied the same time
with Amos so briefly that his prophecie is not parted into chapters
1 against the Idumeans foreshewing their destruction 10 for their
perpetual emnitie against the Iewes and confederacie with the Chaldees
17 The captiuitie and relaxation of the Iewes 19 And redemption of
the whole world by Christ


THE vision of Abdias Thus sayth our Lord God to Edom We haue heard a
bruit from our Lord and he hath sent a legate to the Gentils Rise ye
and let vs arise against him into battel 2 Behold I haue geuen thee a
litle one in the Gentils thou art contemptible excedingly 3 The pride
of thy hart hath extolled thee dwelling in the clefts of rockes
exalting thy throne which sayst in thy hart Who shal plucke me downe
to the earth 4 If thou shalt be exalted as an eagle and if thou shalt
set thy nest among the starres thence wil I plucke thee downe sayth
our Lord 5 If theues had gone in to thee if robbers by night how
hadst thou held thy peace would not they haue stolen thinges sufficent
for themselues if the grape gathereres had entered in to thee would
they not haue left thee at the least a cluster 6 How haue they searched
Esau haue they sought out his hidden thinges 7 Euen to the border haue
they cast thee out al the men of thy league haue mocked thee the men
of thy peace haue peuailed against thee they that eate with thee shal
lay embushments vnder thee there is no wisedom in him 8 Why shal not
I in that day sayth our Lord destroy the wise out of Idumea and
prudence from the mount of Esau 9 And thy valients of the South shal
feare that man may perish from the mount of Esau 10 For the slaughter
and for the iniquitie against thy brother Iacob confusion shal couer
thee and thou shalt perish for euer 11 In the day when thou stoodest
against him when strangers tooke his armie and foreners entered his
gates and vpon Ierusalem cast lotte thou also wast as one of them
12 And thou shalt not dispise in the day of thy brother in the day of
his peregrination and thou shalt not reioyce ouer the children of Iuda
in the day of their perdition  thou shalt not magnifie thy mouth in
the day of distresse 13 Neither shalt thou enter the gate of my people
in the day of their ruine neither shalt thou also dispise in his euils
in the day of his distruction and thou shalt not be sent out against
his armie in the day of his destruction 14 Neither shalt thou stand in
the outgoings to kil them that flee and thou shalt not shut vp his
remnant in the day of tribulation 15 Because the day of our Lord is at
hand vpon al nations as thou hast done so shal it be done to thee
thy retribution he wil returne vpon thine owne head 16 For as you haue
drunke vpon my holie mount shal al Gentils drinke continually  they
shal drinke and swallow vp and they shal be as though they were not
17 And in mount Sion shal be saluation and it shal be holie and the
house of Iacob shal possesse those that had possessed them 18 And the
house of Iacob shal be a fyre and the house of Ioseph a flame and the
house of Esau stubble and they shal be kindled in them and shal
deuoure them and there shal be no remaynes of the house of Esau
because our Lord hath spoken 19 And they that are toward the South
shal inherite the mount of Esau and they in the champaine countries
Philisthiims and they shal possesse the region of Ephraim and the
region of Samaria and Beniamin shal possesse Galaad 20 And the
transmigration of this host of the children of Israel al places of the
Chananeits euen to Sarepta and the transmigration of Ierusalem that is
in Bosphorus shal possesse the cities of the South 21 And sauiours
shal ascend into mount Sion to iudge the mount of Esau and the kingdom
shal be to our Lord

assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
