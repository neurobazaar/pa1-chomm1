THE BREAKING POINT

By Mary Roberts Rinehart





I


Heaven and earth sang the tenor Mr Henry Wallace owner of the
Wallace garage His larynx which gave him somewhat the effect of having
swallowed a crabapple and got it only part way down protruded above
his low collar

Heaven and earth sang the bass Mr Edwin Goodno of the meat market
and the Boy Scouts Heaven and earth are full His chin large and
fleshy buried itself deep his eyes were glued on the music sheet in
his hand

Are full are full are full sang the soprano Clare Rossiter of the
yellow colonial house on the Ridgely Road She sang with her eyes turned
up and as she reached G flat she lifted herself on her toes Of the
majesty of Thy glory

Ready barked the choir master Full now and all together

The choir room in the parish house resounded to the twenty voices of the
choir The choir master at the piano kept time with his head Earnest
and intent they filled the building with the Festival Te Deum of Dudley
Buck Opus 63 No 1

Elizabeth Wheeler liked choir practice She liked the way in which
after the different parts had been run through the voices finally
blended into harmony and beauty She liked the small sense of
achievement it gave her and of being a part on Sundays of the
service She liked the feeling when she put on the black cassock and
white surplice and the small round velvet cap of having placed in her
locker the things of this world such as a rosecolored hat and a blue
georgette frock and of being stripped as it were for aspirations

At such times she had vague dreams of renunciation She saw herself
cloistered in some quiet spot withdrawn from the world a place where
there were long vistas of pillars and Gothic arches after a photograph
in the living room at home and a great organ somewhere playing

She would go home from church however clad in the rosecolored hat and
the blue georgette frock and eat a healthy Sunday luncheon and by two
oclock in the afternoon when the family slept and Jim had gone to the
country club her dreams were quite likely to be entirely different
Generally speaking they had to do with love Romantic unclouded young
love dramatic only because it was love and very happy

Sometime perhaps some one would come and say he loved her That was
all That was at once the beginning and the end Her dreams led up to
that and stopped Not by so much as a hand clasp did they pass that
wall

So she sat in the choir room and awaited her turn

Altos a little stronger please

Of the majesty of the majesty of the majesty of Thy gloory sang
Elizabeth And was at once a nun and a principal in a sentimental dream
of two

What appeared to the eye was a small and rather ethereal figure with
sleek brown hair and wistful eyes nice eyes of no particular color
Pretty with the beauty of youth sensitive and thoughtful infinitely
loyal and capable of suffering and not otherwise extraordinary was
Elizabeth Wheeler in her plain wooden chair A figure suggestive of no
drama and certainly of no tragedy its attitude expectant and waiting
with that alternate hope and fear which is youth at twenty when all of
life lies ahead and every tomorrow may hold some great adventure

Clare Rossiter walked home that night with Elizabeth She was a tall
blonde girl lithe and graceful and with a calculated coquetry in her
clothes

Do you mind going around the block she asked By Station Street
There was something furtive and yet candid in her voice and Elizabeth
glanced at her

All right But its out of your way isnt it

Yes IYoure so funny Elizabeth Its hard to talk to you But Ive
got to talk to somebody I go around by Station Street every chance I
get

By Station Street Why

I should think you could guess why

She saw that Clare desired to be questioned and at the same time
she felt a great distaste for the threatened confidence She loathed
arminarm confidences the indecency of dragging up and exposing in
whispers things that should have been buried deep in reticence She
hesitated and Clare slipped an arm through hers

You dont know then do you Sometimes I think every one must know
And I dont care Ive reached that point

Her confession naive and shameless and yet somehow not without a
certain dignity flowed on She was mad about Doctor Dick Livingstone
Goodness knew why for he never looked at her She might be the dirt
under his feet for all he knew She trembled when she met him in the
street and sometimes he looked past her and never saw her She didnt
sleep well any more

Elizabeth listened in great discomfort She did not see in Clares
hopeless passion the joy of the flagellant or the selfdramatization
of a neurotic girl She saw herself unwillingly forced to peer into
the sentimental windows of Clares soul and there to see Doctor Dick
Livingstone an unconscious occupant But she had a certain fugitive
sense of guilt also Formless as her dreams had been vague and shy
they had nevertheless centered about some one who should be tall like
Dick Livingstone and alternately grave which was his professional
manner and gay which was his manner when it turned out to be only a
cold and he could take a few minutes to be himself Generally speaking
they centered about some one who resembled Dick Livingstone but who
did not as did Doctor Livingstone assume at times an air of frightful
maturity and pretend that in years gone by he had dandled her on his
knee

Sometimes I think he positively avoids me Clare wailed Theres
the house Elizabeth Do you mind stopping a moment He must be in his
office now The lights burning

I wish you wouldnt Clare Hed hate it if he knew

She moved on and Clare slowly followed her The Rossiter girls flow
of talk had suddenly stopped She was thoughtful and impulsively
suspicious

Look here Elizabeth I believe you care for him yourself

I What is the matter with you tonight Clare

Im just thinking Your voice was so queer

They walked on in silence The flow of Clares confidences had ceased
and her eyes were calculating and a trifle hard

Theres a good bit of talk about him she jerked out finally I
suppose youve heard it

What sort of talk

Oh gossip Youll hear it Everybodys talking about it Its doing
him a lot of harm

I dont believe it Elizabeth flared This town hasnt anything else
to do and so it talks It makes me sick

She did not attempt to analyze the twisted motives that made Clare
belittle what she professed to love And she did not ask what the gossip
was Half way up Palmer Lane she turned in at the cement path between
borders of early perennials which led to the white Wheeler house She
was flushed and angry hating Clare for her unsolicited confidence and
her malice hating even Haverly that smiling treeshaded suburb which
talked

She opened the door quietly and went in Micky the Irish terrier lay
asleep at the foot of the stairs and her fathers voice reading aloud
came pleasantly from the living room Suddenly her sense of resentment
died With the closing of the front door the peace of the house
enveloped her What did it matter if beyond that door there were
unrequited love and petty gossip and even tragedy Not that she put all
that into conscious thought she had merely a sensation of sanctuary
and peace Here within these four walls were all that one should need
love and security and quiet happiness Walter Wheeler pausing to turn a
page heard her singing as she went up the stairs In the moment of the
turning he too had a flash of content Twentyfive years of married life
and all well Nina married Jim out of college Elizabeth singing her
way up the stairs and here by the lamp his wife quietly knitting while
he read to her He was reading Paradise Lost The mind is its own
place and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell a Hell of Heaven

He did a certain amount of serious reading every year

On Sunday mornings during the service Elizabeth earnestly tried to
banish all worldly thoughts In spite of this resolve however she was
always conscious of a certain regret that the choir seats necessitated
turning her profile to the congregation At the age of twelve she had
decided that her nose was too short and nothing had happened since
to change her conviction She seldom so much as glanced at the
congregation During her slow progress up and down the main aisle behind
the Courtney boy who was still a soprano and who carried the great gold
cross she always looked straight ahead Or rather although she was
unconscious of this slightly up She always looked up when she sang
for she had commenced to take singing lessons when the piano music rack
was high above her head

So she still lifted her eyes as she went up the aisle and was extremely
serious over the whole thing Because it is a solemn matter to take a
number of people who have been up to that moment engrossed in thoughts
of food or golf or servants or business and in the twinkling of an eye
as the prayer book said about death turn their minds to worship

Nevertheless although she never looked at the pews she was always
conscious of two of them The one near the pulpit was the Sayres and it
was the social calendar of the town When Mrs Sayre was in it it was
the social season One never knew when Mrs Sayres butler would call up
and say

I am speaking for Mrs Sayre Mrs Sayre would like to have the
pleasure of Miss Wheelers company on Thursday to luncheon at
onethirty

When the Sayre pew was empty the town knew if it happened to be
winter that the Florida or Santa Barbara season was on or in summer
the Maine coast

The other pew was at the back of the church Always it had one occupant
sometimes it had three But the behavior of this pew was very erratic
Sometimes an elderly and portly gentleman with white hair and fierce
eyebrows would come in when the sermon was almost over Again a hand
would reach through the grill behind it and a tall young man who
had had his eyes fixed in the proper direction but not always on
the rector would reach for his hat get up and slip out On these
occasions however he would first identify the owner of the hand and
then bend over the one permanent occupant of the pew a little old lady
His speech was as Yea yea or Nay nay for he either said Ill be
back for dinner or Dont look for me until you see me

And Mrs Crosby without taking her eyes from the sermon would nod

Of late years Doctor David Livingstone had been taking less and less
of the Dontlookformeuntilyouseeme cases and Doctor Dick had
acquired a car which would not freeze when left outside all night like
a forgotten dog and a sense of philosophy about sleep That is that
eleven oclock PM was bedtime to some people but was just eleven
oclock for him

When he went to church he listened to the sermon but rather often
he looked at Elizabeth Wheeler When his eyes wandered as the most
faithful eyes will now and then they were apt to rest on the flag that
had hung ever since the war beside the altar He had fought for his
country in a sea of mud never nearer than two hundred miles to the
battle line fought with a surgical kit instead of a gun but he was
content Not to all the high adventure

Had he been asked suddenly the name of the tall blonde girl who sang
among the sopranos he could not have told it

The Sunday morning following Clare Rossiters sentimental confession
Elizabeth tried very hard to banish all worldly thoughts as usual
and to see the kneeling rising and sitting congregation as there for
worship But for the first time she wondered Some of the faces were
blank as though behind the steady gaze the mind had wandered far
afield or slept Some were intent some even devout But for the first
time she began to feel that people in the mass might be cruel too
How many of them for instance would sometime during the day pass on
behind their hands the gossip Clare had mentioned

She changed her position and glanced quickly over the church The
Livingstone pew was fully occupied and well up toward the front Wallie
Sayre was steadfastly regarding her She looked away quickly

Came the end of the service Came down the aisle the Courtney boy clean
and shining and carrying high his glowing symbol Came the choir two by
two the women first sopranos altos and Elizabeth Came the men
bass and tenor neatly shaved for Sunday morning Came the rector Mr
Oglethorpe a trifle wistful because always he fell so far below the
mark he had set Came the benediction Came the slow rising from its
knees of the congregation and its cheerful bustle of dispersal

Doctor Dick Livingstone stood up and helped Doctor David into his
new spring overcoat He was very content It was May and the sun was
shining It was Sunday and he would have an hour or two of leisure And
he had made a resolution about a matter that had been in his mind for
some time He was very content

He looked around the church with what was almost a possessive eye These
people were his friends He knew them all and they knew him They had
against his protest put his name on the bronze tablet set in the wall
on the roll of honor Small as it was this was his world

Half smiling he glanced about He did not realize that behind their
bows and greetings there was something new that day something not so
much unkind as questioning

Outside in the street he tucked his aunt Mrs Crosby against the
spring wind and waited at the wheel of the car while David entered with
the deliberation of a man accustomed to the sagging of his old sidebar
buggy under his weight Long ago Dick had dropped the titular uncle
and as David he now addressed him

Youre going to play some golf this afternoon David he said firmly
Mike had me out this morning to look at your buggy springs

David chuckled He still stuck to his old horse and to the ancient
vehicle which had been the signal of distress before so many doors for
forty years I can trust old Nettie he would say She doesnt freeze
her radiator on cold nights she doesnt skid and if I drop asleep
shell take me home and into my own barn which is more than any
automobile would do

Im going to sleep he said comfortably Get Wallie SayreI see hes
back from some place againor ask a nice girl Ask Elizabeth Wheeler I
dont think Lucy here expects to be the only woman in your life

Dick stared into the windshield

Ive been wondering about that David he said just how much
right

Balderdash David snorted Dont get any fool notion in your head

Followed a short silence with Dick driving automatically and thinking
Finally he drew a long breath

All right he said how about that golfyou need exercise Youre
putting on weight and you know it And you smoke too much Its either
less tobacco or more walking and you ought to know it

David grunted but he turned to Lucy Crosby in the rear seat

Lucy dyou know where my clubs are

You loaned them to Jim Wheeler last fall If you get three of them back
youre lucky Mrs Crosbys voice was faintly tart Long ago she
had learned that her brothers belongings were his only by right of
purchase and were by way of being community property When early
in her widowhood and her return to his home she had found that her
protests resulted only in a sort of clandestine giving or lending she
had exacted a promise from him I ask only one thing David she
had said Tell me where the things go There wasnt a blanket for the
guestroom bed at the time of the Diocesan Convention

Ill run around to the Wheelers and get them Dick observed in a
carefully casual voice Ill see the Carter baby too David and that
clears the afternoon Any message

Lucy glanced at him but David moved toward the house

Give Elizabeth a kiss for me he called over his shoulder and went
chuckling up the path




II

Mrs Crosby stood on the pavement gazing after the car as it moved off
She had not her brothers simplicity nor his optimism Her married years
had taken her away from the environment which had enabled him to live
his busy uncomplicated life where the only medical man in a growing
community he had learned to form his own sturdy decisions and then to
abide by them

Black and white right and wrong the proper course and the improper
coursehe lived in a sort of twodimensional ethical world But to Lucy
Crosby between black and white there was a gray nomans land of doubt
and indecision a halfway house of compromise and sometimes David
frightened her He was so sure

She passed the open door into the waitingroom where sat two or three
patient and silent figures and went back to the kitchen Minnie the
elderly servant sat by the table reading amid the odor of roasting
chicken outside the door on the kitchen porch was the freezer
containing the dinner icecream An orderly Sunday peace was in the air
a gesture of homely comfort order and security

Minnie got up

Ill unpin your veil for you she offered obligingly Youve got
time to lie down about ten minutes Mrs Morgan said shes got to have
her ears treated

I hope she doesnt sit and talk for an hour

Shell talk all right Minnie observed her mouth full of pins
Shed be talking to me yet if Id stood there Shes got her nerve
too that woman

I dont like to hear you speak so of the patients who come to the
house Minnie

Well I dont like their asking me questions about the family either
said Minnie truculently She wanted to know who was Doctor Dicks
mother Said she had had a woman here from Wyoming and she thought
shed known his people

Mrs Crosby stood very still

I think she should bring her questions to the family she said after
a silence Thank you Minnie

Bonnet in hand she moved toward the stairs climbed them and went into
her room Recently life had been growing increasingly calm and less
beset with doubts For the first time with Dicks coming to live with
them ten years before a boy of twentytwo she had found a vicarious
maternity and gloried in it Recently she had been very happy The war
was over and he was safely back again she could sew on his buttons and
darn his socks and turn down his bed at night He filled the old house
with cheer and with vitality And as David gave up more and more of
the work he took it on his broad shoulders efficient tireless and
increasingly popular

She put her bonnet away in its box and suddenly there rose in her frail
old body a fierce and unexpected resentment against David He had chosen
a course and abided by it He had even now no doubt or falterings Just
as in the first anxious days there had been no doubt in him as to the
essential rightness of what he was doing And nowThis was what came of
taking a life and moulding it in accordance with a predetermined plan
That was for God to do not man

She sat down near her window and rocked slowly to calm herself Outside
the Sunday movement of the little suburban town went by the older
Wheeler girl Nina who had recently married Leslie Ward in her smart
little car Harrison Miller the cynical bachelor who lived next door
on his way to the station news stand for the New York papers young
couples taking small babies for the air in a perambulator younger
couples their eyes on each other and on the future

That too she reflected bitterly Dick was in love She had not watched
him for that very thing for so long without being fairly sure now She
had caught as simple David with his celibate heart could never have
caught the tone in Dicks voice when he mentioned the Wheelers She had
watched him for the past few months in church on Sunday mornings and
she knew that as she watched him so he looked at Elizabeth

And David was so sure So sure

The office door closed and Mrs Morgan went out a knitted scarf
wrapping her ears against the wind and following her exit came the slow
ascent of David as he climbed the stairs to wash for dinner

She stopped rocking

David she called sharply

He opened the door and came in a bulky figure still faintly aromatic
of drugs cheerful and serene

Dyou call me he inquired

Yes Shut the door and come in I want to talk to you He closed the
door and went to the hearthrug There was a photograph of Dick on the
mantel taken in his uniform and he looked at it for a moment Then he
turned All right my dear Lets have it

Did Mrs Morgan have anything to say He stared at her

She usually has he said I never knew you considered it worth
repeating No Nothing in particular

The very fact that Mrs Morgan had limited her inquiry to Minnie
confirmed her suspicions But somehow face to face with David she
could not see his contentment turned to anxiety

I want to talk to you about Dick

Yes

I think hes in love David

Davids heavy body straightened but his face remained serene

We had to expect that Lucy Is it Elizabeth Wheeler do you think

Yes

For a moment there was silence The canary in its cage hopped about a
beady inquisitive eye now on one now on the other of them

Shes a good girl Lucy

Thats not the point is it

Do you think she cares for him

I dont know Theres some talk of Wallie Sayre Hes there a good
bit

Wallie Sayre snorted David Hes never done a days work in his
life and never will He reflected on that with growing indignation He
doesnt hold a candle to Dick Of course if the girls a fool

Hands thrust deep into his pockets David took a turn about the room
Lucy watched him At last

Youre evading the real issue David arent you

Perhaps I am he admitted Id better talk to him I think hes got
an idea he shouldnt marry Thats nonsense

I dont mean that exactly Lucy persisted I mean wont he want a
good many things cleared up before he marries Isnt he likely to want
to go back to Norada

Some of the ruddy color left Davids face He stood still staring at
her and silent

You know he meant to go three years ago but the war came and

Her voice trailed off She could not even now easily recall those days
when Dick was drilling on the golf links and that later period of
separation

If he does go back

Donaldson is dead David broke in almost roughly

Maggie Donaldson is still living

What if she is Shes loyal to the core in the first place In the
second shes criminally liable As liable as I am

There is one thing David I ought to know What has become of the
Carlysle girl

She left the stage There was a sort of general conviction she was
implicated andI dont know Lucy Sometimes I think she was He
sighed I read something about her coming back some months ago in
The Valley That was the thing she was playing the spring before
it happened He turned on her Dont get that in your head with the
rest

I wonder sometimes

I know it

Outside the slamming of an automobile door announced Dicks return and
almost immediately Minnie rang the old fashioned gong which hung in the
lower hall Mrs Crosby got up and placed a leaf of lettuce between the
bars of the bird cage

Dinner time Caruso she said absently Caruso was the name Dick had
given the bird And to David She must be in her thirties now

Probably Then his anger and anxiety burst out What difference can
it make about her About Donaldsons wife About any hangover from that
rotten time Theyre gone all of them Hes here Hes safe and happy
Hes strong and fine Thats gone

In the lower hall Dick was taking off his overcoat

Smells like chicken Minnie he said into the dining room

Chicken and biscuits Mr Dick

Hi up there he called lustily Come and feed a starving man Im
going to muffle the doorbell

He stood smiling up at them very tidy in his Sunday suit very boyish
for all his thirtytwo years His face smilingly tender as he watched
them was strong rather than handsome quietly dependable and faintly
humorous

In the language of our great ally he said Madame et Monsieur le
diner est servi

In his eyes there was not only tenderness but a somewhat emphasized
affection as though he meant to demonstrate not only to them but to
himself that this new thing that had come to him did not touch their
old relationship For the new thing had come He was still slightly
dazed with the knowledge of it and considerably anxious Because he had
just taken a glance at himself in the mirror of the walnut hatrack and
had seen nothing there particularly to inspirewell to inspire what he
wanted to inspire

At the foot of the stairs he drew Lucys arm through his and held her
hand She seemed very small and frail beside him

Some day he said a strong wind will come along and carry off Mrs
Lucy Crosby and the Doctors Livingstone will be obliged hurriedly to
rent aeroplanes and to search for her at various elevations

David sat down and picked up the old fashioned carving knife

Get the clubs he inquired

Dick looked almost stricken

I forgot them David he said guiltily Jim Wheeler went out to look
them up and IIll go back after dinner

It was sometime later in the meal that Dick looked up from his plate and
said

Id like to cut office hours on Wednesday night David Ive asked
Elizabeth Wheeler to go into town to the theater

What about the baby at the Homer place

Not due until Sunday Ill leave my seat number at the box office
anyhow

What are you going to see Dick Mrs Crosby asked Will you have
some dumplings


I will but David shouldnt Too much starch Why its The Valley I
think An actress named Carlysle Beverly Carlysle is starring in it

He ate on his mind not on his food but back in the white house on
Palmer Lane and a girl Lucy Crosby fork in air stared at him and
then glanced at David

But David did not look up from his plate




III


The Wheeler house was good modern and commonplace Walter Wheeler and
his wife were like the house Just as here and there among the furniture
there was a fine thing an antique highboy a Sheraton sideboard or
some old cut glass so they had with a certain mediocrity their own
outstanding virtues They liked music believed in the home as the unit
of the nation put happiness before undue ambition and had devoted
their lives to their children

For many years their lives had centered about the children For years
they had held anxious conclave about whooping cough about small early
disobediences later about Sunday tennis They stood united to protect
the children against disease trouble and eternity

Now that the children were no longer children they were sometimes
lonely and still apprehensive They feared motor car accidents and
Walter Wheeler had withstood the appeals of Jim for a half dozen years
They feared trains for them and journeys and unhappy marriages and
hid their fears from each other Their nightly prayers were to keep
them safe and happy

But they saw life reaching out and taking them one by one They saw
them still as children but as children determined to bear their own
burdens Jim stayed out late sometimes and considered his manhood in
question if interrogated Nina was married and out of the home but
there loomed before them the possibility of maternity and its dangers
for her There remained only Elizabeth and on her they lavished the
care formerly divided among the three

It was their intention and determination that she should never know
trouble She was tenderer than the others more docile and gentle They
saw her not as a healthy normal girl but as something fragile and
very precious

Nina was different They had always worried a little about Nina
although they had never put their anxiety to each other Nina had always
overrun her dress allowance although she had never failed to be sweetly
penitent about it and Nina had always placed an undue emphasis on
things Her bedroom before her marriage was cluttered with odds and
ends cotillion favors and photographs college pennants and small
unwise purchasestrophies of the gayety and conquest which were her
life

And Nina had come out It had cost a great deal and it was not so
much to introduce her to society as to put a family recognition on a
fact already accomplished for Nina had brought herself out unofficially
at sixteen There had been the club ballroom and a great many flowers
which withered before they could be got to the hospital and new
clothing for all the family and a caterer and orchestra After that
for a cold and tumultuous winter Mrs Wheeler had sat up with the
dowagers night after night until all hours and the next morning had
let Nina sleep while she went about her household duties She had aged
rather and her determined smile had grown a little fixed

She was a good woman and she wanted her childrens happiness more than
anything in the world but she had a faint and sternly repressed
feeling of relief when Nina announced her engagement Nina did it with
characteristic sangfroid at dinner one night

Dont ring for Annie for a minute mother she said I want to tell
you all something Im going to marry Leslie Ward

There had been a momentary pause Then her father said

Just a minute Is that Will Wards boy

Yes Hes not a boy

Well hell come around to see me before theres any engagement Has
that occurred to either of you

Oh hell be around Hed have come tonight but Howard Moore is
having his bachelor dinner I hope he doesnt look shot to pieces
tomorrow These bachelor things Wed better have a dinner or
something mother and announce it

There had been the dinner with a silver loving cup bought for the
occasion and thereafter to sit out its useless days on the Sheraton
sideboard And there had been a trousseau and a wedding so expensive
that a small frown of anxiety had developed between Walter Wheelers
eyebrows and stayed there

For Ninas passion for things was inherent persisting after her
marriage She discounted her birthday and Christmases in advance coming
around to his office a couple of months before the winter holidays and
needing something badly

Its like this daddy she would say Youre going to give me a check
for Christmas anyhow arent you And it would do me more good now I
simply cant go to another ball

Wheres your trousseau

Its worn outdanced to rags And out of date too

I dont understand it Nina You and Leslie have a good income Your
mother and I

You didnt have any social demands And wedding presents If one more
friend of mine is married

He would get out his checkbook and write a check slowly and
thoughtfully And tearing it off would say

Now remember Nina this is for Christmas Dont feel aggrieved when
the time comes and you have no gift from us

But he knew that when the time came Margaret his wife would hold out
almost to the end and then slip into a jewelers and buy Nina something
she simply couldnt do without

It wasnt quite fair he felt It wasnt fair to Jim or to Elizabeth
Particularly to Elizabeth

Sometimes he looked at Elizabeth with a little prayer in his heart
never articulate that life would be good to her that she might keep
her illusions and her dreams that the soundness and wholesomeness of
her might keep her from unhappiness Sometimes as she sat reading or
sewing with the light behind her shining through her soft hair he saw
in her a purity that was almost radiant

He was in arms at once a night or two before Dick had invited Elizabeth
to go to the theater when Margaret Wheeler said

The house was gayer when Nina was at home

Yes And you were pretty sick of it Full of roistering young idiots
Piano and phonograph going at once pairs of gigglers in the pantry
at the refrigerator pairs on the stairs and on the verandah
cigarashesmy cigarsand cigarettes over everything and more
infernal spooning going on than Ive ever seen in my life

He had resumed his newspaper to put it down almost at once

Whats that Sayre boy hanging around for

I think hes in love with her Walter

Love Any of the Sayre tribe Jim Sayre drank himself to death and
this boy is like him And Jim Sayre wasnt faithful to his wife This
boy iswell hes an heir Thats why he was begotten

Margaret Wheeler stared at him

Why Walter she said Hes a nice boy and hes a gentleman

Why Because he gets up when you come into the room Why in
heavens name dont you encourage real men to come here Theres Dick
Livingstone Hes a man

Margaret hesitated

Walter have you ever thought there was anything queer about Dick
Livingstones coming here

Darned good for the town that he did come

Butnobody ever dreamed that David and Lucy had a nephew Then he
turns up and they send him to medical college and all that

Ive got some relations I havent notified the town I possess he said
grimly

Well theres something odd I dont believe Henry Livingstone the
Wyoming brother ever had a son

What possible foundation have you for a statement like that

Mrs Cook Morgans sisterinlaw has been visiting her lately She says
she knew Henry Livingstone well years ago in the West and she never
heard he was married She says positively he was not married

And trust the Morgan woman to spread the good news he said with angry
sarcasm Well suppose thats true Suppose Dick is an illegitimate
child Thats the worst thats implied I daresay Thats nothing
against Dick himself Ill tell the world theres good blood on the
Livingstone side anyhow

You were very particular about Wallie Sayres heredity Walter

Thats different he retorted and retired into gloomy silence behind
his newspaper Drat these women anyhow It was like some fool female to
come there and rake up some old and defunct scandal Hed stand up for
Dick if it ever came to a showdown He liked Dick What the devil did
his mother matter anyhow If this town hadnt had enough evidence of
Dick Livingstones quality the last few years hed better go elsewhere
He

He got up and whistled for the dog

Im going to take a walk he said briefly and went out He always
took a walk when things disturbed him

On the Sunday afternoon after Dick had gone Elizabeth was alone in her
room upstairs On the bed lay the sort of gown Nina would have called
a dinner dress and to which Elizabeth referred as her dark blue Seen
thus in the room which was her own expression there was a certain
nobility about her very simplicity a steadiness about her eyes that was
almost disconcerting

Shes the saintlylooking sort that would go on the rocks for some
man Nina had said once rather flippantly and never know she was
shipwrecked No man in the world could do that to me

But just then Elizabeth looked totally unlike shipwreck Nothing seemed
more like a safe harbor than the Wheeler house that afternoon or
all the afternoons Life went on the comfortable life of an upper
middleclass household Candles and flowers on the table and a neat
waitress to serve little carefully planned shopping expeditions fine
handsewing on dainty undergarments for rainy days small tributes of
books and candy invitations and consultations as to what to wear choir
practice a class in the Sunday school a little work among the poor
the volcano which had been Nina overflowing elsewhere in a smart little
house with a butler out on the Ridgely Road

She looked what she was faithful and quietly loyal steadyand serene
not asking greatly but hoping much full of small unvisualized dreams
and little inarticulate prayers waiting without knowing that she was
waiting

Sometimes she worried She thought she ought to do something A good
many of the girls she knew wanted to do something but they were vague
as to what She felt at those times that she was not being very useful
and she had gone so far as to lay the matter before her father a couple
of years before when she was just eighteen

Just what do you think of doing he had inquired

Thats it she had said despondently I dont know I havent any
particular talent you know But I dont think I ought to go on having
you support me in idleness all my life

Well I dont think it likely that Ill have to he had observed
dryly But heres the point and I think its important I dont intend
to work without some compensation and my family is my compensation
You just hang around and make me happy as you do and youre fulfilling
your economic place in the nation Dont you forget it either

That had comforted her She had determined then never to marry but to
hang around as he suggested for the rest of her life She was quite
earnest about it and resolved

She picked up the blue dress and standing before her mirror held it up
before her It looked rather shabby she thought but the theater was
not like a dance and anyhow it would look better at night She had been
thinking about next Wednesday evening ever since Dick Livingstone
had gone It seemed better somehow frightfully important It was
frightfully important For the first time she acknowledged to herself
that she had been fond of him as she put it for a long time She had
an odd sense too of being young and immature and as though he had
stooped to her from some height such as thirtytwo years and being in
the war and having to decide about life and death and so on

She hoped he did not think she was only a child

She heard Nina coming up the stairs At the click of her high heels on
the hard wood she placed the dress on the bed again and went to the
window Her father was on the path below clearly headed for a walk She
knew then that Nina had been asking for something

Nina came in and closed the door She was smaller than Elizabeth and
very pretty Her eyebrows had been drawn to a tidy line and from the
top of her shining head to her brown suede pumps she was exquisite with
the hours of careful tending and careful dressing she gave her young
body Exquisitely pretty too

She sat down on Elizabeths bed with a sigh

I really dont know what to do with father she said He flies off
at a tangent over the smallest things Elizabeth dear can you lend me
twenty dollars Ill get my allowance on Tuesday

I can give you ten

Well ask mother for the rest wont you You neednt say its for me
Ill give it to you Tuesday

Im not going to mother Nina She has had a lot of expenses this
month

Then Ill borrow it from Wallie Sayre Nina said accepting her defeat
cheerfully If it was an ordinary bill it could wait but I lost it at
bridge last night and its got to be paid

You oughtnt to play bridge for money Elizabeth said a bit primly
And if Leslie knew you borrowed from Wallace Sayre

I forgot Wallies downstairs Elizabeth Really if he wasnt so
funny hed be tragic

Why tragic He has everything in the world

If you use a little bit of sense you can have it too

I dont want

Pooh Thats what you think now Wallies a nice person Lots of girls
are mad about him And he has about all the money there is Getting
no response from Elizabeth she went on I was thinking it over last
night Youll have to marry sometime and it isnt as though Wallie was
dissipated or anything like that I suppose he knows his way about but
then they all do

She got up

Be nice to him anyhow she said Hes crazy about you and when I
think of you in that house Its a wonderful house Elizabeth Shes got
a suite waiting for Wallie to be married before she furnishes it

Elizabeth looked around her virginal little room with its painted
dressing table its chintz and its white bed with the blue dress on it

Im very well satisfied as I am she said

While she smoothed her hair before the mirror Nina surveyed the room and
her eyes lighted on the frock

Are you still wearing that shabby old thing she demanded I do wish
youd get some proper clothes Are you going somewhere

Im going to the theater on Wednesday night

Who with Nina in her family was highly colloquial

With Doctor Livingstone

Are you joking Nina demanded

Joking Of course not

Nina sat down again on the bed her eyes on her sister curious and not
a little apprehensive

Its the first time its ever happened to my knowledge she declared
I know hes avoided me like poison I thought he hated women You know
Clare Rossiter is

Elizabeth turned suddenly

Clare is ridiculous she said She hasnt any reserve or dignity
or anything else And I dont see what my going to the theater with Dick
Livingstone has to do with her anyhow

Nina raised her carefully plucked eyebrows

Really she said You neednt jump down my throat you know She
considered her eyes on her sister Dont go and throw yourself away on
Dick Livingstone Sis Youre too goodlooking and he hasnt a cent A
suburban practice out all night that tumbledown old house and two
old people hung around your necks for Doctor David is letting go pretty
fast It just wont do Besides theres a story going the rounds about
him that

I dont want to hear it if you dont mind

She went to the door and opened it

Ive hardly spoken a dozen words to him in my life But just remember
this When I do find the man I want to marry I shall make up my own
mind As you did she added as a parting shot

She was rather sorry as she went down the stairs She had begun to
suspect what the family had never guessed that Nina was not very happy
More and more she saw in Ninas passion for clothes and gaiety for
small possessions an attempt to substitute them for real things She
even suspected that sometimes Nina was a little lonely

Wallie Sayre rose from a deep chair as she entered the livingroom

Hello he said I was on the point of asking Central to give me this
number so I could get you on the upstairs telephone

Nina and I were talking Im sorry

Wallie in spite of Walter Wheelers opinion of him was an engaging
youth with a wide smile an air of careless wellbeing and an obstinate
jaw What he wanted he went after and generally secured and Elizabeth
enlightened by Nina began to have a small anxious feeling that
afternoon that what he wanted just now happened to be herself

Nina coming down he asked

I suppose so Why

You couldnt pass the word along that you are going to be engaged for
the next half hour

I might but I certainly dont intend to

You are as hard to isolate as aas a germ he complained I gave
up a perfectly good golf game to see you and as your father generally
calls the dog the moment I appear and goes for a walk I thought I might
see you alone

Youre seeing me alone now you know

Suddenly he leaned over and catching up her hand kissed it

Youre so cool and sweet he said II wish you liked me a little
He smiled up at her rather wistfully I never knew any one quite like
you

She drew her hand away Something Nina had said that he knew his way
about came into her mind and made her uncomfortable Back of him
suddenly was that strange and mysterious region where men of his sort
lived their furtive manlife where they knew their way about She had
no curiosity and no interest but the mere fact of its existence as
revealed by Nina repelled her

There are plenty like me she said Dont be silly Wallie I hate
having my hand kissed

I wonder he observed shrewdly whether thats really true or
whether you just hate having me do it

When Nina came in he was drawing a rough sketch of his new power boat
being built in Florida

Ninas delay was explained by the appearance a few minutes later of
a rather sullen Annie with a tea tray Afternoon tea was not a Wheeler
institution but was notoriously a Sayre one And Nina believed in
putting ones best foot foremost even when that resulted in a state of
unstable domestic equilibrium

Put in a word for me Nina Wallie begged I intend to ask Elizabeth
to go to the theater this week and I think she is going to refuse

Whats the play Nina inquired negligently She was privately
determining that her mother needed a tea cart and a new tea service
There were some in old Georgian silver

The Valley Not that the play matters Its Beverly Carlysle

I thought she was dead or something

Or something is right She retired years ago at the top of her
success She was a howling beauty Im told I never saw her There was
some queer story Ive forgotten it I was a kid then How about it
Elizabeth

Im sorry Im going Wednesday night

He looked downcast over that and he was curious too But he made no
comment save

Well better luck next time

Just imagine said Nina Shes going with Dick Livingstone Can you
imagine it

But Wallace Sayre could and did He had rather a stricken moment too
Of course there might be nothing to it but on the other hand there
very well might And Livingstone was the sort to attract the feminine
woman he had gravity and responsibility He was older too and that
flattered a girl

Hes not a bit attractive Nina was saying Quiet andwell I dont
suppose he knows what hes got on

Wallie was watching Elizabeth

Oh I dont know he said with masculine fairness Hes a good sort
and hes pretty much of a man

He was quite sure that the look Elizabeth gave him was grateful

He went soon after that keeping up an appearance of gaiety to the end
and very careful to hope that Elizabeth would enjoy the play

Shes a wonder they say he said from the doorway Take two hankies
along for its got more tears than East Lynne and The Old Homestead
put together

He went out holding himself very erect and looking very cheerful until
he reached the corner There however he slumped and it was a rather
despondent young man who stood sometime later on the center of the
deserted bridge over the small river and surveyed the water with moody
eyes

In the dusky livingroom Nina was speaking her mind

You treat him like a dog she said Oh I know youre civil to him
but if any man looked at me the way Wallie looks at youI dont know
though she added thoughtfully It may be that that is why he is so
keen It may be good tactics Most girls fall for him with a crash

But when she glanced at Elizabeth she saw that she had not heard Her
eyes were fixed on something on the street beyond the window Nina
looked out With a considerable rattle of loose joints and four
extraordinarily worn tires the Livingstone car was going by




IV

David did not sleep well that night He had not had his golf after
all for the Homer baby had sent out his advance notice early in the
afternoon and had himself arrived on Sunday evening at the hour when
Minnie was winding her clock and preparing to retire early for the
Monday washing and the Sayre butler was announcing dinner Dick had
come in at ten oclock weary and triumphant to announce that Richard
Livingstone Homer sex male color white weight nine pounds had been
safely delivered into this vale of tears

David lay in the great walnut bed which had been his mothers and read
his prayer book by the light of his evening lamp He read the Evening
Prayer and the Litany and then at last he resorted to the thirtynine
articles which usually had a soporific effect on him But it was no
good

He got up and took to pacing his room a portly solid old figure in
striped pajamas and the pair of knitted bedroom slippers which were
always Mrs Morgans Christmas offering To Doctor David with love and
a merry Xmas from Angeline Morgan

At last he got his keys from his trousers pocket and padded softly down
the stairs and into his office where he drew the shade and turned on
the lights Around him was the accumulated professional impedimenta of
many years the oldfashioned surgical chair the corner closet which
had been designed for china and which held his instruments the
bookcase his framed diplomas on the wall their signatures faded their
seals a little dingy his desk from which Dick had removed the old
ledger which had held those erratic records from which when he needed
money he had been wontand reluctantto make out his bills

Through an open door was Dicks office a neat place of shining linoleum
and small glass stands highly modern and businesslike Beyond the
office and opening from it was his laboratory which had been the fruit
closet once and into which Dick on occasion retired to fuss with slides
and tubes and stains and a microscope

Sometimes he called David in and talked at length and with enthusiasm
about such human interest things as the Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus
and the Friedlander bacillus The older man would listen but his eyes
were oftener on Dick than on the microscope or the slide

David went to the bookcase and got down a large book much worn and
carried it to his desk

An hour or so later he heard footsteps in the hall and closed the book
hastily It was Lucy a wadded dressing gown over her nightdress and a
glass of hot milk in her hand

You drink this and come to bed David she said peremptorily Ive
been lying upstairs waiting for you to come up and I need some sleep

He had no sort of hope that she would not notice the book

I just got to thinking things over Lucy he explained his tone
apologetic Theres no use pretending Im not worried I am

Well its in Gods hands she said quite simply Take this up and
drink it slowly If you gulp it down it makes a lump in your stomach

She stood by while he replaced the book in the bookcase and put out the
lights Then in the darkness she preceded him up the stairs

Youd better take the milk yourself Lucy he said Youre not
sleeping either

Ive had some Goodnight

He went in and sitting on the side of his bed sipped at his milk Lucy
was right It was not in their hands He had the feeling all at once of
having relinquished a great burden He crawled into bed and was almost
instantly asleep

So sometime after midnight found David sleeping and Lucy on her knees
It found Elizabeth dreamlessly unconscious in her white bed and Dick
Livingstone asleep also but in his clothing and in a chair by the
window In the light from a street lamp his face showed lines of fatigue
and nervous stress lines only revealed when during sleep a man casts
off the mask with which he protects his soul against even friendly eyes

But midnight found others awake It found Nina for instance in her
draped French bed consulting her jeweled watch and listening for
Leslies return from the country club An angry and rather heartsick
Nina And it found the night editor of one of the morning papers
drinking a cup of coffee that a boy had brought in and running through
a mass of copy on his desk He picked up several sheets of paper with
a photograph clamped to them and ran through them quickly A man in a
soft hat sitting on the desk watched him idly

Beverly Carlysle commented the night editor Back with bells on He
took up the photograph Doesnt look much older does she Its a queer
world

Louis Bassett star reporter and feature writer of the TimesRepublican
smiled reminiscently

She was a wonder he said I interviewed her once and I was crazy
about her She had the stage set for me all right The papers had been
full of the incident of Jud Clark and the night he lined up fifteen
Johnnies in the lobby each with a bouquet as big as a tub all of them
in top hats and Inverness coats and standing in a row So she played up
the heavy domestic for me knitting or sewing I forget

Fell for her did you

Did I That was ten years ago and Im not sure Im over it yet

Probably thats the reason said the city editor drily Go and see
her and get over it Get her views on the flapper and bobbed hair for
next Sunday Smith would be crazy about it

He finished his coffee

You might ask too what she thinks has become of Judson Clark he
added I have an idea she knows if any one does Bassett stared at
him

Youre joking arent you

Yes But it would make a darned good story




V

When he finished medical college Dick Livingstone had found like other
men that the two paths of ambition and duty were parallel and did not
meet Along one lay his desire to focus all his energy in one direction
to follow disease into the laboratory instead of the sick room and
there to fight its unsung battles And win He felt that he would win

Along the other lay David

It was not until he had completed his course and had come home that he
had realized that David was growing old Even then he might have felt
that by the time David was compelled to relinquish his hold on his
practice he himself would be sufficiently established in his specialty
to take over the support of the household But here there was interposed
a new element one he had not counted on David was fiercely jealous of
his practice the thought that it might pass into new and alien hands
was bitter to him To hand it down to his adopted son was one thing to
pass it over to some young whippersnapper was another

Nor were Davids motives selfish or unworthy His patients were his
friends He had a sense of responsibility to them and very little
faith in the new modern methods He thought there was a great deal of
tomfoolery about them and he viewed the gradual loss of faith in drugs
with alarm When Dick wore rubber gloves during their first obstetric
case together he snorted

Ive delivered about half the population of this town he said and
slapped em to make em breathe with my own bare hands And Im still
here and so are they

For by that time Dick had made his decision He could not abandon
David For him then and hereafter the routine of a general practice in a
suburban town the long hours the varied responsibilities the feeling
he had sometimes that by doing many things passably he was doing none of
them well But for compensation he had old Davids content and greater
leisure and Lucy Crosbys gratitude and love

Now and then he chafed a little when he read some article in a medical
journal by one of his fellow enthusiasts or when in France he saw
men younger than himself obtaining an experience in their several
specialties that would enable them to reach wide fields at home But
mostly he was content or at least resigned He was building up the
Livingstone practice and his one anxiety was lest the time should come
when more patients asked for Doctor Dick than for Doctor David He did
not want David hurt

After ten years the strangeness of his situation had ceased to be
strange Always he meant some time to go back to Norada and there to
clear up certain things but it was a long journey and he had very
little time And as the years went on the past seemed unimportant
compared with the present He gave little thought to the future

Then suddenly his entire attention became focused on the future

Just when he had fallen in love with Elizabeth Wheeler he did not know
He had gone away to the war leaving her a little girl apparently and
he had come back to find her a woman He did not even know he was in
love at first It was when one day he found himself driving past the
Wheeler house without occasion that he began to grow uneasy

The future at once became extraordinarily important and so also but
somewhat less vitally the past Had he the right to marry if he could
make her care for him

He sat in his chair by the window the night after the Homer babys
arrival and faced his situation Marriage meant many things It meant
love and companionship but it also meant should mean children Had he
the right to go ahead and live his life fully and happily Was there
any chance that out of the years behind him there would come some
forgotten thing some taint or incident to spoil the carefully woven
fabric of his life

Not his life Hers

On the Monday night after he had asked Elizabeth to go to the theater
he went into Davids office and closed the door Lucy alive to every
movement in the old house heard him go in and rocking in her chair
overhead her hands idle in her lap waited in tense anxiety for the
interview to end She thought she knew what Dick would ask and what
David would answer And in a way David would be right Dick fine
lovable upstanding Dick had a right to the things other men had to
love and a home of his own to children to his own full life

But suppose Dick insisted on clearing everything up before he married
For to Lucy it was unthinkable that any girl in her senses would refuse
him Suppose he went back to Norada He had not changed greatly in ten
years He had been well known there a conspicuous figure

Her mind began to turn on the possibility of keeping him away from
Norada

Some time later she heard the office door open and then close with
Dicks characteristic slam He came up the stairs two at a time as
was his custom and knocked at her door When he came in she saw what
Davids answer had been and she closed her eyes for an instant

Put on your things he said gayly and well take a ride on the
hilltops Ive arranged for a moon

And when she hesitated

It makes you sleep you know Im going if I have to ride alone and
talk to an imaginary lady beside me

She rather imagined that that had been his first idea modified by his
thought of her She went over and put a wrinkled hand on his arm

You look happy Dick she said wistfully

I am happy Aunt Lucy he replied and bending over kissed her

On Wednesday he was in a state of alternating high spirits and periods
of silence Even Minnie noticed it

Mr Dicks that queer I hardly know how to take him she said to
Lucy He came back and asked for noodle soup and he put about all the
hardware in the kitchen on him and said he was a knight in armor And
when I took the soup in he didnt eat it

It was when he was ready to go out that Lucys fears were realized He
came in as always when anything unusual was afoot to let her look him
over He knew that she waited for him to give his tie a final pat to
inspect the laundering of his shirt bosom to pick imaginary threads off
his dinner coat

Well he said standing before her hows this Art can do no more
Mrs Crosby

Ill brush your back she said and brought the brush He stooped to
her according to the little ceremony she had established and she made
little dabs at his speckless back There thats better

He straightened

How do you think Uncle David is he asked unexpectedly

Better than he has been in years Why

Because Im thinking of taking a little trip Only ten days he added
seeing her face You could houseclean my office while Im away You
know youve been wanting to

She dropped the brush and he stooped to pick it up That gave her a
moment

Where she managed

To Dry River by way of Norada

Why should you go back there she asked in a carefully suppressed
voice Why dont you go East Youve wanted to go back to Johns Hopkins
for months

On the other hand why shouldnt I go back to Norada he asked with
an affectation of lightness Then he put his hand on her shoulders Why
shouldnt I go back and clear things up in my own mind Why shouldnt I
find out for instance that I am a free man

You are free

Ive got to know he said almost doggedly I cant take a chance I
believe I am I believe David of course But anyhow Id like to see the
ranch I want to see Maggie Donaldson

Shes not at the ranch Her husband died you know

I have an idea I can find her he said Ill make a good try
anyhow

When he had gone she got her salts bottle and lay down on her bed Her
heart was hammering wildly

Elizabeth was waiting for him in the livingroom in the midst of
her family She looked absurdly young and very pretty and he had a
momentary misgiving that he was old to her and thatHeaven save the
markthat she looked up to him He considered the blue dress the
height of fashion and the mold of form and having taken off his
overcoat in the hall tried to put on Mr Wheelers instead in his
excitement Also becoming very dignified after the overcoat incident
and making an exit which should conceal his wild exultation and show
only polite pleasure he stumbled over Micky so that they finally
departed to a series of staccato yelps

He felt very hot and slightly ridiculous as he tucked Elizabeth into
the little car being very particular about her feet and starting
with extreme care so as not to jar her He had the feeling of being
entrusted temporarily with something infinitely precious and very very
dear Something that must never suffer or be hurt





VI


On Wednesday morning David was in an office in the city He sat
forward on the edge of his chair and from time to time he took out
his handkerchief and wiped his face or polished his glasses quite
unconscious of either action He was in his best suit with the tie Lucy
had given him for Christmas

Across from him barricaded behind a great mahogany desk sat a small
man with keen eyes and a neat brown beard On the desk were a spotless
blotter an inkstand of silver and a pen Nothing else The terrible
order of the place had at first rather oppressed David

The small man was answering a question

Rather on the contrary I should say The stronger the character the
greater the smash

David pondered this

Ive read all youve written on the subject he said finally
Especially since the war

The psychoanalyst put his finger tips together judicially Yes The
war bore me out he observed with a certain complacence It added a
great deal to our literature too although some of the positions are
not well taken Van Alston for instance

You have said I think that every man has a breaking point

Absolutely All of us We can go just so far Where the mind is strong
and very sound we can go further than when it is not Some men for
instance lead lives that would break you or me Was therewas there
such a history in this case

Yes Doctor Davids voice was reluctant

The mind is a strange thing went on the little man musingly It
has its censors that go off duty during sleep Our sternest and often
unconscious repressions pass them then and emerge in the form of
dreams But of course you know all that Dream symbolism Does
the person in this case dream That would be interesting perhaps
important

I dont know David said unhappily

The walling off you say followed a shock

Shock and serious illness

Was there fear with the shock

David hesitated Yes he said finally Very great fear I believe

Doctor Lauler glanced quickly at David and then looked away

I see he nodded Of course the walling off of a part of the
pastyou said a part

Practically all of it Ill tell you about that later What about the
walling off

It is generally the result of what we call the protective mechanism of
fear Back of most of these cases lies fear Not cowardice but perhaps
we might say the limit of endurance Fear is a complex of course
Dislike in a small way has the same reaction We are apt to forget
the names of persons we dislike But if you have been reading on the
subject

Ive been studying it for ten years

Ten years Do you mean that this condition has persisted for ten
years

David moistened his dry lips Yes he admitted It might not have
done so but thethe person who made this experiment used suggestion
The patient was very ill and weak It was desirable that he should
not identify himself with his past The loss of memory of the period
immediately preceding was complete but of course gradually the cloud
began to lift over the earlier periods It was there that suggestion
was used so that such memories as came back werewell the patient
adapted them to fit what he was told

Again Doctor Lauler shot a swift glance at David and looked away

An interesting experiment he commented It must have taken courage

A justifiable experiment David affirmed stoutly And it took
courage Yes

David got up and reached for his hat Then he braced himself for the
real purpose of his visit

What I have been wondering about he said very carefully is this
this mechanism of fear this wallhow strong is it

Strong

Its like a dam I take it It holds back certain memories like a
floodgate Is anything likely to break it down

Possibly something intimately connected with the forgotten period might
do it I dont know Livingstone Weve only commenced to dig into
the mind and we have many theories and a few established facts For
instance the primal instincts

He talked on with David nodding now and then in apparent understanding
but with his thoughts far away He knew the theories a good many of
them he considered poppycock Dreams might come from the subconscious
mind but a good many of them came from the stomach They might be
safety valves for the mind but also they might be rarebit He didnt
want dreams what he wanted was facts Facts and hope

The office attendant came in She was as tidy as the desk as obsessed
by order as wooden She placed a pad before the small man and withdrew
He rose

Let me know if I can be of any further assistance Doctor he said
And Ill be glad to see your patient at any time Id like the record
for my files

Thank you David said He stood fingering his hat

I suppose theres nothing to do The dam will either break or it
wont

Thats about it Of course since the conditions that produced the
setting up of the defensive machinery were unhappy Id say that
happiness will play a large part in the situation That happiness and
a normal occupation will do a great deal to maintain the status quo
Of course I would advise no return to the unhappy environment and no
shocks Nothing in other words to break down the wall

Outside in the corridor David remembered to put on his hat Happiness
and a normal occupation yes But no shock

Nevertheless he felt vaguely comforted and as though it had helped to
bring the situation out into the open and discuss it He had carried his
burden alone for ten years or with only the additional weight of Lucys
apprehensions He wandered out into the city streets and found himself
some time later at the railway station without remembering how he got
there

Across from the station was a large billboard and on it the name of
Beverly Carlysle and her play The Valley He stood for some time and
looked at it before he went in to buy his ticket Not until he was in
the train did he realize that he had forgotten to get his lunch

He attended to his work that evening as usual but he felt very tired
and Lucy going in at nine oclock found him dozing in his chair his
collar half choking him and his face deeply suffused She wakened him
and then sitting down across from him joined him in the vigil that was
to last until they heard the car outside

She had brought in her sewing and David pretended to read Now and then
he looked at his watch

At midnight they heard the car go in and the slamming of the stable
door followed by Dicks footsteps on the walk outside Lucy was very
pale and the hands that held her sewing twitched nervously Suddenly
she stood up and put a hand on Davids shoulder

Dick was whistling on the kitchen porch




VII

Louis Bassett was standing at the back of the theater talking to the
publicity man of The Valley company Fred Gregory Bassett was calm and
only slightly interested By the end of the first act he had realized
that the star was giving a fine performance that she had even grown in
power and that his sentimental memory of her was considerably dearer
than the reality

Going like a house afire he said as the curtain fell

Beside his robust physique Gregory the publicity man sank into
insignificance Even his pale spats at which Bassett had shot a
contemptuous glance his highly expensive tailoring failed to make him
appear more than he was a little dapper man with a pale cold eye and
a rather too frequent smile Shes the best there is was his comment
He hesitated then added Shes my sister you know Naturally for
business reasons I dont publish the relationship

Bassett glanced at him

That so Well Im glad she decided to come back Shes too good to
bury

But if he expected Gregory to follow the lead he was disappointed His
eyes blank and expressionless were wandering over the house as the
lights flashed up

This whole tour has been a triumph Shes the best there is Gregory
repeated and they know it

Does she know it Bassett inquired

She doesnt throw any temperament if thats what you mean She

He checked himself suddenly and stood clutching the railing bent
forward and staring into the audience Bassett watched him considerably
surprised It took a great deal to startle a theatrical publicity man
yet here was one who looked as though he had seen a ghost

After a time Gregory straightened and moistened his dry lips

Theres a man sitting down theresee here the sixth row next the
aisle theres a girl in a blue dress beside him See him Do you know
who he is

Never saw him before

For perhaps two minutes Gregory continued to stare Then he moved over
to the side of the house and braced against the wall continued his close
and anxious inspection After a time he turned away and passing behind
the boxes made his way into the wings Bassetts curiosity was aroused
especially when shortly after Gregory reappeared bringing with him
a small man in an untidy suit who was probably Bassett surmised the
stage manager

He saw the small man stare nod stand watching and finally disappear
and Gregory resume his former position and attitude against the side
wall Throughout the last act Gregory did not once look at the stage He
continued his steady unwavering study of the man in the sixth row seat
next the aisle and Bassett continued his study of the little man

His long training made him quick to scent a story He was not sure of
course but the situation appeared to him at least suggestive With the
end of the play he wandered out with the crowd edging his way close to
the man and girl who had focused Gregorys attention and following them
into the street He saw only a tall man with a certain quiet distinction
of bearing and a young and pretty girl still flushed and excited who
went up the street a short distance and got into a small and shabby car
Bassett noted carefully the license number of the car

Then still curious and extremely interested he walked briskly around
to the stage entrance nodded to the doorkeeper and went in

Gregory was not in sight but the stage manager was there directing the
striking of the last set

Im waiting for Gregory Bassett said Hasnt fainted has he

What dyou mean fainted inquired the stage manager with a touch of
hostility

I was with him when he thought he recognized somebody You know who
You can tell him I got his automobile number

The stage managers hostility faded and he fell into the trap You
know about it then

I was with him when he saw him Unfortunately I couldnt help him out

Its just possible its a chance resemblance Im darned if I know
Look at the facts Hes supposed to be dead Ten years dead His moneys
been split up a dozen ways from the ace ThenI knew him you knowI
dont think even he would have the courage to come here and sit through
a performance Although he added reflectively Jud Clark had the
nerve for anything

Bassett gave him a cigar and went out into the alley way that led to the
street Once there he stood still and softly whistled Jud Clark If
that was Judson Clark he had the story of a lifetime

For some time he walked the deserted streets of the city thinking and
puzzling over the possibility of Gregorys being right Sometime after
midnight he went back to the office and to the filing room There for
two hours he sat reading closely old files of the paper going through
them methodically and making occasional brief notes in a memorandum
Then at two oclock he put away the files and sitting back lighted a
cigar

It was all there the enormous Clark fortune inherited by a boy who had
gone mad about this same Beverly Carlysle her marriage to her leading
man Howard Lucas the subsequent killing of Lucas by Clark at his
Wyoming ranch and Clarks escape into the mountains The sensational
details of Clarks infatuation the drama of a crime and Clarks
subsequent escape and the later certainty of his death in a mountain
storm had filled the newspapers of the time for weeks Judson Clark had
been famous notorious infamous and dead all in less than two years A
shameful and somehow a pitiful story

But if Judson Clark had died the story still lived Every so often it
came up again Three years before he had been declared legally dead and
his vast estates as provided by the will of old Elihu Clark had gone
to universities and hospitals But now and then came a rumor Jud Clark
was living in India he had a cattle ranch in Venezuela he had been
seen on the streets of New Orleans

Bassett ran over the situation in his mind

First then grant that Clark was still living and had been in the
theater that night It became necessary to grant other things To grant
for instance that Clark was capable of sitting with a girl beside him
through a performance by the woman for whom he had wrecked his life of
a play he had once known from the opening line to the tag To grant that
he could laugh and applaud and at the drop of the curtain go calmly
away with such memories behind him as must be his To grant too that
he had survived miraculously his sensational disappearance found a new
identity and a new place for himself even witness the girl possible
new ties

At half past two Bassett closed his memorandum book stuffed it into his
pocket and started for home As he passed the Ardmore Hotel he looked
up at its windows Gregory would have told her probably He wondered
half amused whether the stage manager had told him of his inquiries
and whether in that case they might not fear him more than Clark
himself After all they had nothing to fear from Clark if this were
Clark

No What they might see and dread knowing he had had a hint of a
possible situation was the revival of the old story she had tried so
hard to live down She was ambitious and a new and rigid morality was
sweeping the country What once might have been an asset stood now to be
a bitter liability

He slowed down absorbed in deep thought It was a queer story It might
be even more queer than it seemed Gregory had been frightened rather
than startled The man had even gone pale

Motive motive that was the word What motive lay behind action
Conscious and unconscious every volitional act was the result of
motive

He wondered what she had done when Gregory had told her

As a matter of fact Beverly Carlysle had shown less anxiety than
her brother Still pale and shocked he had gone directly to her
dressingroom when the curtain was rung down had tapped and gone in
She was sitting wearily in a chair a cigarette between her fingers
Around was the usual litter of a stage dressingroom after the play the
long shelf beneath the mirror crowded with powders rouge and pencils
a bunch of roses in the corner washstand basin a wardrobe trunk and a
maid covering with cheesecloth bags the evenings costumes

It went all right I think Fred

Yes he said absently Go on out Alice Ill let you come back in a
few minutes

He waited until the door closed

Whats the matter she asked rather indifferently If its more
quarreling in the company I dont want to hear it Im tired Then she
took a full look at him and sat up

Fred What is it

He gave her the truth brutally and at once

I think Judson Clark was in the house tonight

I dont believe it

Neither would I if somebody told me he agreed sullenly I saw
him Dont you suppose I know him And if you dont believe me call
Saunders I got him out front He knows

You called Saunders

Why not I tell you Bev I was nearly crazy Im nearly crazy now

What did Saunders say

If he didnt know Clark was dead hed say it was Clark

She was worried by that time but far more collected than he was She
sat absently tapping the shelf with a nail file and reflecting

All right she said Suppose he was What then He has been in hiding
for ten years Why shouldnt he continue to hide What would bring him
out now Unless he needed money Was he shabby

No he said sulkily He was with a girl He was dressed all right

You didnt say anything except to Saunders

No Im not crazy

Id better see Joe she reflected Go and get him Fred And tell
Alice she neednt wait

She got up and moved about the room putting things away and finding
relief in movement a still beautiful woman with rather accentuated
features and an easy carriage Without her makeup the stage illusion
of her youth was gone and she showed past suffering and present strain
Just then she was uneasy and resentful startled but not particularly
alarmed Her reason told her that Judson Clark even if he still lived
and had been there that night meant to leave the dead past to care for
itself and wished no more than she to revive it She was surprised to
find as she moved about that she was trembling

Her brother came back and she turned to meet him To her surprise he
was standing inside the door white to the lips and staring at her with
wild eyes

Saunders he said chokingly Saunders the damned fool Hes given it
away

He staggered to a chair and ran a handkerchief across his shaking lips

He told Bassett of the TimesRepublican he managed to say Do
youdo you know what that means And Bassett got Clarks automobile
number He said so

He looked up at her his face twitching Theyre hound dogs on a scent
Bev Theyll get the story and blow it wide open

You know Im prepared for that I have been for ten years

I know He was suddenly emotional He reached out and took her hand
Poor old Bev he said After the way youve come back too Its a
damned shame

She was calmer than he was less convinced for one thing and better
balanced always She let him stroke her hand standing near him with her
eyes absent and a little hard

Id better make sure that was Jud first he offered after a time
and then warn him

Why

Bassett will be after him

No she commanded sharply No Fred You let the thing alone Youve
built up an imaginary situation and youre not thinking straight
Plenty of things might happen What probably has happened is that this
Bassett is at home and in bed

She sent him out for a taxi soon after and they went back to the hotel
But alone later on in her suite in the Ardmore she did not immediately
go to bed She put on a dressing gown and stood for a long time by her
window looking out Instead of the city lights however she saw a
range of snowcapped mountains and sheltered at their foot the Clark
ranch house built by the old millionaire as a place of occasional
refuge from the pressure of his life There he had raised his fine
horses and trained them for the track There when late in life he
married he had taken his wife for their honeymoon and two years later
for the birth of their son And there when she died he had returned
with the child himself broken and prematurely aged to be killed by one
of his own stallions when the boy was fifteen

Six years his own master Judson had been twentyone to her twenty when
she first met him Going the usual pace too and throwing money right
and left He had financed her as a star ransacking Europe for her
stage properties and then he fell in love with her She shivered as she
remembered it It had been desperate and terrible because she had cared
for some one else

Standing by the window she wondered as she had done over and over again
for ten years what would have happened if instead of marrying Howard
she had married Judson Clark Would he have settled down She had felt
sometimes that in his wildest moments he was only playing a game that
amused him that the hardheaded part of him inherited from his father
sometimes stood off and watched with a sort of interested detachment
the follies of the other That he played his wild game with his tongue
in his cheek

She left the window turned out the lights and got into her bed She
was depressed and lonely and she cried a little After a time she
remembered that she had not put any cream on her face She crawled out
again and went through the familiar motions in the dark




VIII

Dick rose the next morning with a sense of lightness and content that
sent him singing into his shower In the old stable which now housed
both Nettie and the little car Mike was washing them both with
indiscriminate wavings of the hose nozzle his old pipe clutched in
his teeth From below there came up the odors of frying sausages and of
strong hot coffee

The world was a good place A fine old place It had work and play and
love It had office hours and visits and the golf links and it had soft
feminine eyes and small tender figures to be always cared for and looked
after

She liked him She did not think he was old She thought his profession
was the finest in the world She had wondered if he would have time to
come and see her some day Time He considered very seriously as he
shaved before the slightly distorted mirror in the bathroom whether
it would be too soon to run in that afternoon just to see if she was
tired or had caught cold or anything Perhaps tomorrow would look
better No hang it all today was today

On his way from the bathroom to his bedroom he leaned over the
staircase

Aunt Lucy he called

Yes Dick

The top of the morning to you Dyou think Minnie would have time to
press my blue trousers this morning

There was the sound of her chair being pushed back in the diningroom
of a colloquy in the kitchen and Minnie herself appeared below him

Just throw them down Doctor Dick she said Ive got an iron hot
now

Some day Minnie he announced you will wear a halo and with the
angels sing

This mood of unreasoning happiness continued all morning He went from
house to house properly grave and responsible but with a small song in
his heart and about eleven oclock he found time to stop at the village
haberdashers and to select a new tie which he had wrapped and stuffed
in his pocket And which inspected in broad day later on a country
road gave him uneasy qualms as to its brilliance

At the luncheon table he was almost hilarious and David played up to
him albeit rather heavily But Lucy was thoughtful and quiet She had a
sense of things somehow closing down on them of hands reaching out from
the past and clutching Mrs Morgan Beverly Carlysle Dick in love and
possibly going back to Norada Unlike David who was content that one
emergency had passed she looked ahead and saw their common life a
series of such chances with their anxieties and their dangers

She could not eat

Nevertheless when she herself admitted a new patient for Dick that
afternoon she had no premonition of trouble She sent him into the
waitingroom a tall robust and youngish man perhaps in his late
thirties and went quietly on her way to her sittingroom and to her
weekly mending

On the other hand Louis Bassett was feeling more or less uncomfortable
There was an air of peace and quiet respectability about the old house
a domestic odor of baking cake a quietness and stability that somehow
made his errand appear absurd To connect it with Judson Clark and his
tumultuous past seemed ridiculous

His errand on the surface was a neuralgic headache

When hat in hand he walked into Dicks consulting room he had made up
his mind that he would pay the price of an overactive imagination for a
prescription walk out again and try to forget that he had let a chance
resemblance carry him off his feet

But as he watched the man who sat across from him tilted back in his
swivel chair he was not so sure Here was the same tall figure the
heavy brown hair the features and boyish smile of the photograph he had
seen the night before As Judson Clark might have looked at thirtytwo
this man looked

He made his explanation easily Was in town for the day Subject to
these headaches Worse over the right eye No he didnt wear glasses
perhaps he should

It wasnt Clark It couldnt be Jud Clark sitting there tilted back
in an old chair and asking questions as to the nature of his fictitious
pain Impossible Nevertheless he was of a mind to clear the slate and
get some sleep that night and having taken his prescription and paid
for it he sat back and commenced an apparently casual interrogation

Two names on your sign I see Father and son I suppose

Doctor David Livingstone is my uncle

I should think youd be in the city Limitations to this sort of thing
arent there

I like it said Dick with an eye on the office clock

Patients are your friends of course Born and raised here I suppose

Not exactly I was raised on a ranch in Wyoming My father had a ranch
out there

Bassett shot a glance at him but Dick was calm and faintly smiling

Wyoming the reporter commented Thats a long way from here
Anywhere near the new oil fields

Not far from Norada Thats the oil center Dick offered
goodnaturedly He rose and glanced again at the clock If those
headaches continue youd better have your eyes examined

Bassett was puzzled It seemed to him that there had been a shade of
evasion in the other mans manner slightly less frankness in his eyes
But he showed no excitement nothing furtive or alarmed And the open
and unsolicited statement as to Norada baffled him He had to admit to
himself either that a man strongly resembling Judson Clark had come from
the same neighborhood or

Norada he said Thats where the big Clark ranch was located wasnt
it Ever happen to meet Judson Clark

Our place was very isolated

Bassett found himself being politely ushered out considerably more at
sea than when he went in and slightly irritated His annoyance was not
decreased by the calm voice behind him which said

Better drink considerable water when you take that stuff Some stomachs
dont tolerate it very well

The door closed The reporter stood in the waitingroom for a moment
Then he clapped on his hat

Well Im a damned fool he muttered and went out into the street

He was disappointed and a trifle sheepish Life was full of queer
chances that was all No resemblance on earth no coincidence of
birthplace could make him believe that Judson Clark waster profligate
and fugitive from the law was now sitting up at night with sick
children or delivering babies

After a time he remembered the prescription in his hand and was about
to destroy it He stopped and examined it and then carefully placed it
in his pocketbook After all there were things that looked queer The
fellow had certainly evaded that last question of his

He made his way head bent toward the station

He had ten minutes to wait and he wandered to the newsstand He made
a casual inspection of its display bought a newspaper and was turning
away when he stopped and gazed after a man who had just passed him from
an outbound train

The reporter looked after him with amused interest Gregory too The
Livingstone chap had certainly started something But it was odd too
How had Gregory traced him Wasnt there something more in Gregorys
presence there than met the eye Gregorys visit might be like his own
the desire to satisfy himself that the man was or was not Clark Or it
might be the result of a conviction that it was Clark and a warning
against himself But if he had traced him didnt that indicate that
Clark himself had got into communication with him In other words that
the chap was Clark after all Gregory having made an inquiry of a
hackman had started along the street and after a moments thought
Bassett fell into line behind him He was extremely interested and
increasingly cheerful He remained well behind and with his newspaper
rolled in his hand assumed the easy yet brisk walk of the commuters
around him bound for home and their early suburban dinners

Half way along Station Street Gregory stopped before the Livingstone
house read the sign and rang the doorbell The reporter slowed down
to give him time for admission and then slowly passed In front of
Harrison Millers house however he stopped and waited He lighted a
cigarette and made a careful survey of the old place Strange if this
were to prove the haven where Judson Clark had taken refuge this old
brick twostory dwelling with its ramshackle stable in the rear its
small vegetable garden its casual beds of simple garden flowers set in
a half acre or so of ground

A doctor A pill shooter Jud Clark

Elizabeth had gone about all day with a smile on her lips and a sort of
exaltation in her eyes She had girl fashion gone over and over the
totally uneventful evening they had spent together remembering small
speeches and gestures what he had said and she had answered

She had for instance mentioned Clare Rossiter very casually Oh
very very casually And he had said Clare Rossiter Oh yes the tall
blonde girl isnt she

She was very happy He had not seemed to find her too young or
particularly immature He had asked her opinion on quite important
things and listened carefully when she replied She felt though that
she knew about onetenth as much as he did and she determined to
read very seriously from that time on Her mother missing her that
afternoon found her curled up in the library beginning the first
volume of Gibbons Rome with an air of determined concentration and
wearing her best summer frock

She did not intend to depend purely on Gibbons Rome evidently

Are you expecting any one Elizabeth she asked with the frank
directness characteristic of mothers and Elizabeth fixing a date in
her mind with terrible firmness looked up absently and said

No one in particular

At three oclock with a slight headache from concentration she went
upstairs and put up her hair again rather high this time to make her
feel taller Of course it was not likely he would come He was very
busy So many people depended on him It must be wonderful to be like
that to have people needing one and looking out of the door and
saying I think I see him coming now

Nevertheless when the postman rang her heart gave a small leap and then
stood quite still When Annie slowly mounted the stairs she was already
on her feet but it was only a card announcing Mrs Sayre Wednesday
May fifteenth luncheon at onethirty

However at half past four the bell rang again and a masculine voice
informed Annie a moment later that it would put its overcoat here
because lately a dog had eaten a piece out of it and got most awful
indigestion

The time it took Annie to get up the stairs again gave her a moment
so that she could breathe more naturally and she went down very
deliberately and so dreadfully poised that at first he thought she was
not glad to see him

I came you see he said I intended to wait until tomorrow but I
had a little time But if youre doing anything

I was reading Gibbons Rome she informed him I think every one
should know it Dont you

Good heavens what for he inquired

I dont know They looked at each other and suddenly they laughed

I wanted to improve my mind she explained I felt last night that
youthat you know so many things and that I was frightfully stupid

Do you mean to say he asked aghast that I Great Scott

Settled in the livingroom they got back rather quickly to their status
of the night before and he was moved to confession

I didnt really intend to wait until tomorrow he said I got up
with the full intention of coming here today if I did it over the
wreck of my practice At eleven oclock this morning I held up a
consultation ten minutes to go to Yardsleys and buy a tie for this
express purpose Perhaps you have noticed it already

I have indeed Its a wonderful tie

Neat but not gaudy eh He grinned at her happily You know you
might steer me a bit about my ties I have the taste of an African
savage I nearly bought a purple one with red stripes And Aunt Lucy
thinks I should wear white lawn like David

They talked those small highly significant nothings which are only the
barrier behind which go on the eager questionings and unspoken answers
of youth and love They had known each other for years had exchanged
the same give and take of neighborhood talk when they met as now Today
nothing was changed and everything

Then out of a clear sky he said

I may be going away before long Elizabeth

He was watching her intently She had a singular feeling that behind
this as behind everything that afternoon was something not spoken
Something that related to her Perhaps it was because of his tone

You dont meannot to stay

No I want to go back to Wyoming Where I was born Only for a few
weeks

And in that only for a few weeks there lay some of the unspoken
things That he would miss her and come back quickly to her That she
would miss him and that subconsciously he knew it And behind that
too a promise He would come back to her

Only for a few weeks he repeated I thought perhaps if you wouldnt
mind my writing to you now and thenI write a rotten hand you know
Most medical men do

I should like it very much she said primly

She felt suddenly very lonely as though he had already gone and
slightly resentful not at him but at the way things happened And then
too everyone knew that once a Westerner always a Westerner The West
always called its children Not that she put it that way But she had
a sort of vision gained from the moving pictures of a country of wide
spaces and tall mountains where men wore quaint clothing and the women
rode wild horses and had the dash she knew she lacked She was stirred
by vague jealousy

You may never come back she said casually After all you were born
there and we must seem very quiet to you

Quiet he exclaimed You are heavenly restful and comforting You
he checked himself and got up Then Im to write and you are to make
out as much of my scrawl as you can and answer Is that right

Ill write you all the town gossip

If you do he threatened her Youre to write me what youre doing
and all about yourself Remember Ill be counting on you

And if their voices were light there was in both of them the sense
of a pact made of a bond that was to hold them like clasped hands
against their coming separation It was rather anticlimacteric after
that to have him acknowledge that he didnt know exactly when he could
get away

She went with him to the door and stood there her soft hair blowing as
he got into the car When he looked back as he turned the corner she
was still there He felt very happy affable and he picked up an elderly
village woman with her and went considerably out of his way to take her
home

He got back to the office at half past six to find a redeyed Minnie in
the hall




X

AT half past five that afternoon David had let himself into the house
with his latch key hung up his overcoat on the old walnut hat rack and
went into his office The strain of the days before had told on him and
he felt weary and not entirely well He had fallen asleep in his buggy
and had wakened to find old Nettie drawing him slowly down the main
street of the town pursuing an erratic but homeward course while the
people on the pavements watched and smiled

He went into his office closed the door and then on the old leather
couch with its sagging springs he stretched himself out to finish his
nap

Almost immediately however the doorbell rang and a moment later
Minnie opened his door

Gentleman to see you Doctor David

He got up clumsily and settled his collar Then he opened the door into
his waitingroom

Come in he said resignedly

A small dapper man in precisely the type of clothes David most
abominated and wearing lightcolored spats rose from his chair and
looked at him with evident surprise

Im afraid Ive made a mistake A Doctor Livingstone left his seat
number for calls at the box office of the Annex Theater last nightthe
Happy Valley companybut he was a younger man I

David stiffened but he surveyed his visitor impassively from under his
shaggy white eyebrows

I havent been in a theater for a dozen years sir

Gregory was convinced that he had made a mistake Like Louis Bassett
the very unlikeliness of Jud Clark being connected with the domestic
atmosphere and quiet respectability of the old house made him feel
intrusive and absurd He was about to apologize and turn away when he
thought of something

There are two names on your sign The other one was he by any chance
at the theater last night

I think I shall have to have a reason for these inquiries David said
slowly

He was trying to place Gregory to fit him into the situation straining
back over ten years of security racking his memory without result

Just what have you come to find out he asked as Gregory turned and
looked around the room

The other Doctor Livingstone is your brother

My nephew

Gregory shot a sharp glance at him but all he saw was an elderly man
with heavy white hair and fierce shaggy eyebrows a portly and dignified
elderly gentleman rather resentfully courteous

Sorry to trouble you he said I suppose Ive made a mistake Iis
your nephew at home

No

May I see a picture of him if you have one

Davids wild impulse was to smash Gregory to the earth to annihilate
him His collar felt tight and he pulled it away from his throat

Not unless I know why you want to see it

He is tall rather spare And he took a young lady to the theater last
night Gregory persisted

He answers that description What of it

And he is your nephew

My brothers son David said steadily

Somehow it began to dawn on him that there was nothing inimical in this
strange visitor that he was anxious and ill at ease There was indeed
something almost beseeching in Gregorys eyes as though he stood ready
to give confidence for confidence And more than that a sort of not
unfriendly stubbornness as though he had come to do something he meant
to do

Sit down he said relaxing somewhat Certainly my nephew is making
no secret of the fact that he went to the theater last night If youll
tell me who you are

But Gregory did not sit down He stood where he was and continued to
eye David intently

I dont know just what it conveys to you Doctor but I am Beverly
Carlysles brother

David lowered himself into his chair His knees were suddenly weak under
him But he was able to control his voice

I see he said And waited

Something happened last night at the theater It may be important Id
have to see your nephew in order to find out if it is I cant afford
to make a mistake

Davids ruddy color had faded He opened a drawer of his desk and
produced a copy of the photograph of Dick in his uniform Maybe this
will help you

Gregory studied it carefully carrying it to the window to do so When
he confronted David again he was certain of himself and his errand for
the first time and his manner had changed

Yes he said significantly It does

He placed the photograph on the desk and sitting down drew his chair
close to Davids Ill not use any names Doctor I think you know what
Im talking about I was sure enough last night Im certain now

David nodded Go on

Well start like this God knows I dont want to make any trouble But
Ill put a hypothetical case Suppose that a man when drunk commits a
crime and then disappears suppose he leaves behind him a bad record
and an enormous fortune suppose then he reforms and becomes a useful
citizen and everything is buried

Doctor David listened stonily Gregory lowered his voice

Suppose theres a woman mixed up in that situation Not guiltily but
theres a lot of talk And suppose she lives it down for ten years
and then goes back to her profession in a play the families take the
children to see and makes good It isnt hard to suppose that neither
of those two people wants the thing revived is it

David cleared his throat

You mean then that there is danger of such a revival

I think there is Gregory said bitterly I recognized this man last
night and called a fellow who knew him in the old days Saunders
our stage manager And a newspaper man named Bassett wormed it out of
Saunders You know what that means

David heard him clearly but as though from a great distance

You can see how it appears to Bassett If hes found it its the big
story of a lifetime I thought hed better be warned

When David said nothing but sat holding tight to the arms of his old
chair Gregory reached for his hat and got up

The thing for him to do he said is to leave town for a while This
Bassett is a houndhog on a scent They all are He is Bassett of the
TimesRepublican And he took Judhe took your nephews automobile
license number

Still David sat silent and Gregory moved to the door

Get him away tonight if you can

Thank you David said His voice was thick I appreciate your
coming

He got up dizzily as Gregory said Goodevening and went out The
room seemed very dark and unsteady and not familiar So this was what
had happened after all the safe years A man could work and build and
pray but if his house was built on the sand

As the outer door closed David fell to the floor with a crash




XI

Bassett lounged outside the neat privet hedge which it was Harrison
Millers custom to clip with his own bachelor hands and waited And
as he waited he tried to imagine what was going on inside behind the
neatly curtained windows of the old brick house

He was tempted to ring the bell again pretend to have forgotten
something and perhaps happen in on what might be drama of a rather high
order what supposing the man was Clark after all was fairly sure to
be drama He discarded the idea however and began again his interested
survey of the premises Whoever conceived this sort of haven for Clark
if it were Clark had shown considerable shrewdness The town fairly
smelt of respectability the treeshaded streets the children in socks
and small crisplaundered garments the houses set back each in its
square of shaved lawn all peaceful middle class and unexciting The
last town in the world for Judson Clark the last profession the last
house this shabby old brick before him

He smiled rather grimly as he reflected that if Gregory had been right
in his identification he was beyond those windows at that moment very
possibly warning Clark against himself Gregory would know his type
that he never let go He drew himself up a little

The house door opened and Gregory came out turning toward the station
Bassett caught up with him and put a hand on his arm

Well he said cheerfully It was wasnt it

Gregory stopped dead and stared at him Then

Old dog Tray he said sneeringly If your brain was as good as your
nose Bassett youd be a whale of a newspaper man

Dont bother about my brain Its working fine today anyhow Well
what had he to say for himself

Gregorys mind was busy and he had had a moment to pull himself
together

We both get off together he said more amiably That fellow isnt
Jud Clark and never was Hes a doctor and the nephew of the old doctor
there Theyre in practice together

Did you see them both

Yes

Bassett eyed him Either Gregory was a good actor or the whole trail
ended there after all He himself had felt after his interview with
Dick that the scent was false And there was this to be said Gregory
had been in the house scarcely ten minutes Long enough to acknowledge a
mistake but hardly long enough for any dramatic identification He was
keenly disappointed but he had had long experience of disappointment
and after a moment he only said

Well thats that He certainly looked like Clark to me

Ill say he did

Rather surprised him didnt you

Oh he was all right Gregory said I didnt tell him anything of
course

Bassett looked at his watch

I was after you all right he said cheerfully But if I was barking
up the wrong tree Im done I dont have to be hit on the head to
make me stop Come and have a sodawater on me he finished amiably
Theres no train until seven

But Gregory refused

No thanks Ill wander on down to the station and get a paper

The reporter smiled Gregory was holding a grudge against him for a bad
night and a bad day

All right he said affably Ill see you at the train Ill walk
about a bit

He turned and started back up the street again walking idly His
chagrin was very real He hated to be fooled and fooled he had been
Gregory was not the only one who had lost a nights sleep Then
unexpectedly he was hailed from the curbstone and he saw with
amazement that it was Dick Livingstone

Take you anywhere Dick asked Hows the headache

Better thanks Bassett stared at him No Im just walking around
until traintime Are you starting out or going home at this hour

Going home Well glad the heads better

He drove on leaving the reporter gazing after him So Gregory had
been lying He hadnt seen this chap at all Then why He walked
on turning this new phase of the situation over in his mind Why
this elaborate fiction if Gregory had merely gone in waited for ten
minutes and come out again

It wasnt reasonable It wasnt logical Something had happened inside
the house to convince Gregory that he was right He had seen somebody
or something He hadnt needed to lie He could have said frankly
that he had seen no one But no he had built up a fabric carefully
calculated to throw Bassett off the scent

He saw Dick stop in front of the house get out and enter And coming
to a decision he followed him and rang the doorbell For a long time no
one answered Then the maid of the afternoon opened the door her eyes
red with crying and looked at him with hostility

Doctor Richard Livingstone

You cant see him

Its important

Well you cant see him Doctor David has just had a stroke Hes in
the office now on the floor

She closed the door on him and he turned and went away It was all
clear to him Gregory had seen not Clark but the older man had told
him and gone away And under the shock the older man had collapsed That
was sad It was very sad But it was also extremely convincing

He sat up late that night again running over the entries in his
notebook The old story as he pieced it out ran like this

It had been twelve years ago when according to the old files
Clark had financed Beverly Carlysles first starring venture He had
apparently started out in the beginning only to give her the publicity
she needed In devising it however he had shown a sort of boyish
recklessness and ingenuity that had caught the interest of the press
and set newspaper men to chuckling wherever they got together

He had got together a dozen or so of young men like himself wealthy
idle and reckless with youth and headed by him they had made the
exploitation of the young star an occupation The newspapers referred
to the star and her constellation as Beverly Carlysle and her Broadway
Beauties It had been unvicious young and highly entertaining and it
had cost Judson Clark his membership in his fathers conservative old
clubs

For a time it livened the theatrical world with escapades that were
harmless enough if sensational Then after a time newspaper row began
to whisper that young Clark was in love with the girl The Broadway
Beauties broke up after a wild farewell dinner The audiences ceased
to expect a row of a dozen youths all dressed alike with gardenias in
their buttonholes and perhaps red neckties with their evening suits to
rise in their boxes on the stars appearance and solemnly bow And the
star herself lost a little of the anxious look she frequently wore

The story went after a while that Judson Clark had been refused and
was taking his refusal badly Reporters saw him carelessly dressed
outside the stage door waiting and the story went that the girl had
thrown him over money and all for her leading man One thing was
clear Clark not a drinker before had taken to drinking hard and
after a time and some unpleasant scenes probably she refused to see
him any more

When the play closed in June 1911 she married Howard Lucas
her leading man his third wife Lucas had been not a bad chap a
goodlooking rather negligible man given to allday Sunday poker
carefully valeted not very keen mentally but amiable They had bought
a house on East Fiftysixth Street and were looking for a new play
with Lucas as costar when he unaccountably went to pieces nervously
stopped sleeping and developed a slight twitching of his handsome
rather vacuous face

Judson Clark had taken his yacht and gone to Europe and was reported
from here and there not too favorably But when he came back in early
September he had apparently recovered from his infatuation was his
old carefully dressed self again and when interviewed declared his
intention of spending the winter on his Wyoming ranch

Of course he must have heard of Lucass breakdown and equally of
course he must have seen them both What happened at that interview by
what casual attitude he allayed Lucass probable jealousy and the girls
own nervousness Bassett had no way of discovering It was clear that
he convinced them both of his good faith for the next note in the
reporters book was simply a date September 12 1911

That was the day they had all started West together traveling in
Clarks private car with Lucas twitching slightly smiling and waving
farewell from a window

The big smash did not come until the middle of October

Bassett sat back and considered He had a fairly clear idea of the
conditions at the ranch daily riding some little reading and a great
deal too much of each other A sick man too unhappy in his exile
chafing against his restrictions lonely and irritable The girl early
seeing her mistake and Clarks jealousy of her husband The door into
their apartment closing the thousand and one unconscious intimacies
between man and wife the breakfast for two going up the stairs and
below that hoteyed boy agonized and passionately jealous yet meeting
them and looking after them their host and a gentleman

Lucas took to drinking after a time to allay his sheer boredom And
Jud Clark drank with him At the end of three weeks they were both
drinking heavily and were politely quarrelsome Bassett could fill
that in also He could see the girl protesting watching increasingly
anxious as she saw that Clarks jealousy was matched by her husbands

A queer picture he reflected the three of them shut away on the great
ranch and every day some new tension some new strain

Then one night at dinner they quarreled and Beverly left the table
She was going to pack her things and go back to New York She had felt
probably that something was bound to snap And while she was upstairs
Clark had shot and killed Howard Lucas and himself disappeared

He had run testimony at the inquest revealed to the corral and
saddled a horse Although it was only October it was snowing hard
but in spite of that he had turned his horse toward the mountains By
midnight a posse from Norada had started out and another up the Dry
River Canyon but the storm turned into a blizzard in the mountains and
they were obliged to turn back A few inches more snow and they could
not have got their horses out A week or so later with a crust of ice
over it a few of them began again with no expectation however of
finding Clark alive They came across his horse on the second day but
they did not find him and there were some among them who felt that
after all old Elihu Clarks boy had chosen the better way

Bassett closed his notebook and lighted a cigar

There was a big story to be had for the seeking a whale of a story He
could go to the office give them a hint draw expense money and start
for Norada the next night He knew well enough that he would have to
begin there and that it would not be easy Witnesses of the affair
at the ranch would be missing now or when found the first accuracy of
their statements would either be dulled by time or have been added to
with the passing years The ranch itself might have passed into other
hands To reconstruct the events of ten years ago might be impossible
or nearly so But that was not his problem He would have to connect
Norada with Haverly Clark with Livingstone One thing only was simple
If he found Livingstones story was correct that he had lived on a
ranch near Norada before the crime and as Livingstone then he would
acknowledge that two men could look precisely alike and come from the
same place and yet not be the same If not

But after he had turned out his light and got into bed he began to
feel a certain distaste for his selfappointed task If Livingstone
were Clark if after years of effort he had pulled himself up by his own
bootstraps had made himself a man out of the reckless boy he had been
a decent and useful citizen why pull him down After all the world
hadnt lost much in Lucas a sleek not overintelligent big animal
that had been Howard Lucas

He decided to sleep over it and by morning he found himself not only
disinclined to the business but firmly resolved to let it drop Things
were well enough as they were The woman in the case was making good
Jud was making good And nothing would restore Howard Lucas to that
small theatrical world of his which had waved him goodbye at the
station so long ago

He shaved and dressed his resolution still holding He had indeed
almost a conscious glow of virtue for he was making one of those
inglorious and unsung sacrifices which ought to bring a man credit in
the next world because they certainly got him nowhere in this He was
quite affable to the colored waiter who served his breakfasts in the
bachelor apartment house and increased his weekly tip to a dollar and a
half Then he sat down and opened the TimesRepublican skimming over
it after his habit for his own space and frowning over a row of
exclamation and interrogation points unwittingly set behind the name of
the mayor

On the second page however he stopped coffee cup in air Is Judson
Clark alive Wife of former ranch manager makes confession

A woman named Margaret Donaldson it appeared fatally injured by an
automobile near the town of Norada Wyoming had made a confession on
her deathbed In it she stated that afraid to die without shriving her
soul she had sent for the sheriff of Dallas County and had made the
following confession

That following the tragedy at the Clark ranch her husband John
Donaldson since dead had immediately following the inquest where he
testified started out into the mountains in the hope of finding Clark
alive as he knew of a deserted rangers cabin where Clark sometimes
camped when hunting It was his intention to search for Clark at this
cabin and effect his escape He carried with him food and brandy

That owing to the blizzard he was very nearly frozen that he was
obliged to abandon his horse shooting it before he did so and that
close to death himself he finally reached the cabin and there found
Judson Clark the fugitive who was very ill

She further testified that her husband cared for Clark for four days
Clark being delirious at the time and that on the fifth day he started
back on foot for the Clark ranch having left Clark locked in the cabin
and that on the following night he took three horses two saddled and
one packed with food and supplies That accompanied by herself they went
back to the cabin in the mountains and that she remained there to
care for Clark while her husband returned to the ranch to prevent
suspicion

That a day or so later looking out of her window she had perceived
a man outside in the snow coming toward the cabin and that she had
thought it one of the searching party That her first instinct had been
to lock him outside but that she had finally admitted him and that
thereafter he had remained and had helped her to care for the sick man

Unfortunately for the rest of the narrative it appeared that the injured
woman had here lapsed into a coma and had subsequently died carrying
her further knowledge with her

But the article went on the story opened a field of infinite surmise
In all probability Judson Clark was still alive living under some
assumed identity free of punishment outwardly respectable Three years
before he had been adjudged legally dead and the estate divided under
bond of the legatees

Close to a hundred million dollars had gone to charities and Judson
Clark wherever he was would be dependent on his own efforts for
existence He could have summoned all the legal talent in the country to
his defense but instead he had chosen to disappear

The whole situation turned on the deposition of Mrs Donaldson now
dead The local authorities at Norada maintained that the woman had not
been sane for several years On the other hand the cabin to which she
referred was well known and no search of it had been made at the time
Clarks horse had been found not ten miles from the town and the cabin
was buried in snow twenty miles further away If Clark had made that
journey on foot he had accomplished the impossible

Certain facts according to the local correspondent bore out Margaret
Donaldsons confession Inquiry showed that she was supposed to have
spent the winter following Judson Clarks crime with relatives in Omaha
She had returned to the ranch the following spring

A detailed description of Judson Clark and a photograph of him
accompanied the story Bassett reread the article carefully and
swore a little under his breath If he had needed confirmation of
his suspicions it lay to his hand But the situation had changed over
night There would be a search for Clark now as wide as the knowledge
of his disappearance Local police authorities would turn him up in
every city from Maine to the Pacific coast Even Europe would be on the
lookout and South America

But it was not the police he feared so much as the press Not all of the
papers but some of them would go after that story and send their best
men on it It offered not so much a chance of solution as an opportunity
to revive the old dramatic story He could see when he closed his eyes
the local photographers climbing to that cabin and later sending its
pictures broadcast and divers gentlemen of the press eager to
pit their wits against ten years of time and the ability of a once
conspicuous man to hide from the law packing their suitcases for
Norada

No he couldnt stop now He would go on like the others and with this
advantage that he was morally certain he could lay his hands on Clark
at any time But he would have to prove his case connect it Who for
instance was the other man in the cabin He must have known who the boy
was who lay in that rough bunk delirious Must have suspected anyhow
That made him like the Donaldsons accessory after the fact and
criminally liable Small chance of him coming out with any confession
Yet he was the connecting link Must be

On his third reading the reporter began to visualize the human elements
of the fight to save the boy he saw moving before him the whole pitiful
struggle the indomitable ranch manager his heartbreaking struggle
with the blizzard the shooting of his horse the careful disarming of
suspicion and later the intrepid woman daring that night ride through
snow that had sent the posse back to its firesides to the boy locked in
the cabin and raving

His mind was busy as he packed his suitcase Already he had forgotten
his compunctions of the early morning he moved about methodically
calculating roughly what expense money he would need and the line of
attack if any required at the office Between Norada and that old
brick house at Haverly lay his story Ten years of it He was closing
his bag when he remembered the little girl in the blue dress at the
theater He straightened and scowled After a moment he snapped the bag
shut Damn it all if Clark had chosen to tie up with a girl that was on
Clarks conscience not his

But he was vaguely uncomfortable

Its a queer world Joe he observed to the waiter who had come in
for the breakfast dishes


Yes sir It is that said Joe




XII

DURING all the long night Dick sat by Davids bedside Earlier in
the evening there had been a consultation David had suffered a light
stroke but there was no paralysis and the prognosis was good For this
time at least David had escaped but there must be no other time He
was to be kept quiet and free from worry his diet was to be carefully
regulated and with care he still had long years before him

David slept his breathing heavy and slow In the morning there would
be a nurse but that night Dick having sent Lucy to bed himself
kept watch On the walnut bed lay Doctor Davids portly figure dimly
outlined by the shaded lamp and on a chair drawn close sat Dick

He was wideawake and very anxious but as time went on and no untoward
symptoms appeared as Davids sleep seemed to grow easier and more
natural Dicks thoughts wandered They went to Elizabeth first and
then on and on from that starting point through the years ahead He saw
the old house with Elizabeth waiting in it for his return he saw both
their lives united and flowing on together with children with small
cares with the routine of daily living and behind it all the two of
them hand in hand

Then his mind turned on himself How often in the past ten years it had
done that He had sat off with a sort of professional detachment
and studied his own case With the entrance into his world of the new
science of psychoanalysis he had made now and then small not very
sincere attempts to penetrate the veil of his own unconscious devising
Not very sincere for with the increase of his own knowledge of the mind
he had learned that behind such conditions as his lay generally
deeply hidden the desire to forget And that behind that there lay
acknowledged or not fear

But to forget what he used to say to David when the first textbooks
on the new science appeared and he and David were learning the
new terminology Dick eagerly and David with contemptuous snorts of
derision To forget what

You had plenty to forget David would say stolidly I think this
mans a fool but at thatyoud had your fathers death for one thing
And youd gone pretty close to the edge of eternity yourself Youd
fought singlehanded the worst storm of ten years you came out of it
with double pneumonia and you lay alone in that cabin about fiftysix
hours Forget You had plenty to forget

It had never occurred to Dick to doubt Davids story It did not even
now He had accepted it unquestioningly from the first supplemented the
shadowy childish memories that remained to him with it and gradually
coordinating the two had built out of them his house of the past

Thus the elderly man whom he dimly remembered was not only his father
he was Davids brother And he had died It was the shock of that death
according to David that had sent him into the mountains where David
had followed and nursed him back to health

It was quite simple and even explicable by the new psychology Not that
he had worried about the new psychology in those early days He had
been profoundly lethargic passive and incurious It had been too much
trouble even to think

True he had brought over from those lost years certain instincts and a
few mental pictures He had had a certain impatience at first over the
restrictions of comparative poverty he had had to learn the value of
money And the pictures he retained had had a certain opulence which the
facts appeared to contradict Thus he remembered a large ranch house
and innumerable horses grazing in meadows or milling in a corral But
David had warned him early that there was no estate that his future
depended entirely on his own efforts

Then the new life had caught and held him For the first time he had
mothering and love Lucy was his mother and David the pattern to which
he meant to conform He was happy and contented

Now and then in the early days he had been conscious of a desire to go
back and try to reconstruct his past again Later on he knew that if
he were ever to fill up the gap in his life it would be easier in that
environment of once familiar things But in the first days he had been
totally dependent on David and money was none too plentiful Later on
as the new life took hold as he went to medical college and worked at
odd clerical jobs in vacations to help pay his way there had been
no chance Then the war came and on his return there had been the
practice and his knowledge that Davids health was not what it should
have been

But as time went on he was more and more aware that there was in him a
peculiar shrinking from going back an almost apprehension He knew more
of the mind than he had before and he knew that not physical hardship
but mental stress caused such lapses as his But what mental stress had
been great enough for such a smash His fathers death

Strain and fear said the new psychology Fear He had never found
himself lacking in courage Certainly he would have fought a man who
called him a coward But there was cowardice behind all such conditions
as his a refusal of the mind to face reality It was weak Weak He
hated himself for that past failure of his to face reality

But that night sitting by Davids bed he faced reality with a
vengeance He was in love and he wanted the things that love should
bring to a normal man He felt normal He felt strengthened by love
that he could face whatever life had to bring so long as also it
brought Elizabeth

Painfully he went back over his talk with David the preceding Sunday
night

Dont be a fool David had said Go ahead and take her if shell
have you And dont be too long about it Im not as young as I used to
be

What I feel he had replied is this I dont know of course if she
cares David had grunted I do know Im going to try to make her care
if itif its humanly possible But Id like to go back to the ranch
again David before things go any further

Why

Id like to fill the gap Attempt it anyhow

What he was thinking about as he sat by Davids bedside was Davids
attitude toward that threatened return of his For David had opposed it
offering a dozen trivial almost puerile reasons Had shown indeed a
dogged obstinacy and an irritability that were somehow oddly like fear
David afraid David whose life and heart were open books David whose
eyes never wavered nor his courage

You let well enough alone Dick he had finished Youve got
everything you want And a medical man cant afford to go gadding about
When people want him they want him

But he had noticed that David had been different since He had taken to
following him with his faded old eyes had even spoken once of retiring
and turning all the work over to him Was it possible that David did not
want him to go back to Norada

He bent over and felt the sick mans pulse It was stronger not so
rapid The mechanical act took him back to his first memory of David

He had been lying in a rough bunk in the mountain cabin and David
beside him on a wooden box had been bending forward and feeling his
pulse He had felt weak and utterly inert and he knew now that he
had been very ill The cabin had been a small and lonely one with
snowpeaks not far above it and it had been very cold During the day
a woman kept up the fire Her name was Maggie and she moved about the
cabin like a thin ghost At night she slept in a leanto shed and David
kept the fire going A man who seemed to know him wellJohn Donaldson
he learned was his namewas Maggies husband and every so often he
came about dawn and brought food and supplies

After a long time as he grew stronger Maggie had gone away and David
had fried the bacon and heated the canned tomatoes or the beans Before
she left she had written out a recipe for biscuits and David would
study over it painstakingly and then produce a panfull of burned and
blackened lumps over which he would groan and agonize

He himself had been totally incurious He had lived a sort of animal
life of food and sleep and later on of small tentative excursions
around the room on legs that shook when he walked The snows came and
almost covered the cabin and David had read a great deal and talked at
intervals David had tried to fill up the gap in his mind That was how
he learned that David was his fathers brother and that his father had
recently died

Going over it all now it had certain elements that were not clear They
had for instance never gone back to the ranch at all With the first
clearing of the snow in the spring John Donaldson had appeared again
leading two saddled horses and driving a pack animal and they had
started off leaving him standing in the clearing and gazing after them
But they had not followed Donaldsons trail They had started West over
the mountains and David did not know the country Once they were lost
for three days

He looked at the figure on the bed Only ten years and yet at that time
David had been vigorous seemed almost young He had aged in that ten
years On the bed he was an old man a tired old man at that On that
long ride he had been tireless He had taken the burden of the nightly
camps and had hacked a trail with his hatchet across snow fields while
Dick still weak but furiously protesting had been compelled to stand
and watch

Now with the perspective of time behind him and with the clearly
defined issue of Davids protest against his return to the West he went
again over the details of that winter and spring Why had they not taken
Donaldsons trail Or gone back to the ranch Why since Donaldson
could make it had not other visitors come Another doctor the night
he almost died and David sat under the lamp behind the closescreened
windows and read the very pocket prayerbook that now lay on the stand
beside the bed Why had they burned his clothes and Donaldson brought
a new outfit Why did Donaldson for all his requests never bring a
razor so that when they struck the railroad miles from anywhere they
were both full bearded

He brought himself up sharply He had allowed his imagination to run
away with him He had been depicting a flight and no one who knew David
could imagine him in flight

Nevertheless he was conscious of a new uneasiness and anxiety When
David recovered sufficiently he would go to Norada as he had told
Elizabeth and there he would find the Donaldsons and clear up the
things that bothered him After that

He thought of Elizabeth of her sweetness and sanity He remembered her
at the theater the evening before lost in its fictitious emotions its
counterfeit drama He had felt moved to comfort her when he found her
on the verge of tears

Just remember theyre only acting he had said

Yes But life does do things like that to people

Not often The theater deals in the dramatic exceptions to life You
and I plain bread and butter people come to see these things because
we get a sort of vicarious thrill out of them

Doesnt anything ever happen to the plain bread and butter people

A little jam sometimes Or perhaps they drop it butter side down on
the carpet

But that is tragedy isnt it

He had had to acknowledge that it might be But he had been quite
emphatic over the fact that most people didnt drop it

After a long time he slept in his chair The spring wind came in through
the opened window and fluttered the leaves of the old prayerbook on
the stand




XIII

The week that followed was an anxious one Davids physical condition
slowly improved The slight thickness was gone from his speech and he
sipped resignedly at the broths Lucy or the nurse brought at regular
intervals Over the entire house there hung all day the odor of stewing
chicken or of beef tea in the making and above the doorbell was a white
card which said Dont ring Walk in

As it happened no one in the old house had seen Maggie Donaldsons
confession in the newspaper Lucy was saved that anxiety at least
Appearing as it did the morning after Davids stroke it came in with
the morning milk lay about unnoticed and passed out again to start
a fire or line a pantry shelf Harrison Miller next door read it over
his coffee Walter Wheeler in the eightthirty train glanced at it and
glanced away Nina Ward read it in bed And that was all

There came to the house a steady procession of inquirers and bearers
of small tribute flowers and jellies mostly but other things also
A table in Davids room held a steadily growing number of bedroom
slippers and Mrs Morgan had been seen buying soles for still others
David propped up in his bed would cheer a little at these votive
offerings and then relapse again into the heavy troubled silence that
worried Dick and frightened Lucy Crosby Something had happened she was
sure Something connected with Dick She watched David when Dick was
in the room and she saw that his eyes followed the younger man with
something very like terror

And for the first time since he had walked into the house that night so
long ago followed by the tall young man for whose coming a letter had
prepared her she felt that David had withdrawn himself from her She
went about her daily tasks a little hurt and waited for him to choose
his own time But as the days went on she saw that whatever this new
thing might be he meant to fight it out alone and that the fighting it
out alone was bad for him He improved very slowly

She wondered sometimes if it was after all because of Dicks growing
interest in Elizabeth Wheeler She knew that he was seeing her daily
although he was too busy now for more than a hasty call She felt that
she could even tell when he had seen her he would come in glowing and
almost exalted and as if to make up for the moments stolen from David
would leap up the stairs two at a time and burst into the invalids room
like a cheerful cyclone Wasnt it possible that David had begun to
feel as she did that the girl was entitled to a clean slate before
she pledged herself to Dick And the slatepoor Dickcould never be
cleaned

Then one day David astonished them both He was propped up in his bed
and he had demanded a cigar and been very gently but firmly refused
He had been rather sulky about it and Dick had been attempting to rally
him into better humor when he said suddenly

Ive had time to think things over Dick I havent been fair to you
Youre thrown away here Besides he hesitated Then We might as
well face it The day of the general practitioner has gone

I dont believe it Dick said stoutly Maybe we are only signposts
to point the way to the other fellows but the world will always need
signposts

What Ive been thinking of David pursued his own train of thought
is this I want you to go to Johns Hopkins and take up the special work
youve been wanting to do Ill be up soon and

Call the nurse Aunt Lucy said Dick Hes raving

Not at all David retorted testily Ive told you This whole town
only comes here now to be told what specialist to go to and you know
it

I dont know anything of the sort

If you dont its because you wont face the facts Dick chuckled
and threw an arm over Davids shoulder You old hypocrite he said
Youre trying to get rid of me for some reason Dont tell me youre
going to get married

But David did not smile Lucy watching him from her post by the window
saw his face and felt a spasm of fear At the most she had feared
a mental conflict in David Now she saw that it might be something
infinitely worse something impending and immediate She could hardly
reply when Dick appealed to her

Are you going to let him get rid of me like this Aunt Lucy he
demanded Sentenced to Johns Hopkins like Napoleon to St Helena Are
you with me or forninst me

I dont know Dick she said with her eyes on David If its for
your good

She went out after a time leaving them at it hammer and tongs David
was vanquished in the end but Dick going down to the office later
on was puzzled Somehow it was borne in on him that behind Davids
insistence was a reason unspoken but urgent and the only reason that
occurred to him as possible was that David did not after all want him
to marry Elizabeth Wheeler He put the matter to the test that night
wandering in in dressinggown and slippers as was his custom before
going to bed for a brief chat The nurse was downstairs and Dick moved
about the room restlessly Then he stopped and stood by the bed looking
down

A few nights ago David I asked you if you thought it would be right
for me to marry if my situation justified it and if to your knowledge
there was any other reason why I could not or should not You said there
was not

There is no reason of course If shell have you

I dont know that I know that whether she will or not is a pretty
vital matter to me David

David nodded silently

But now you want me to go away To leave her Youre rather urgent
about it And I feelwell I begin to think you have a reason for it

David clenched his hands under the bedclothing but he returned Dicks
gaze steadily

Shes a good girl he said But shes entitled to more than you can
give her the way things are

That is presupposing that she cares for me I havent an idea that
she does That she may in timeThen thats the reason for this Johns
Hopkins thing is it

Thats the reason David said stoutly She would wait for you Shes
that sort Ive known her all her life Shes as steady as a rock But
shes been brought up to have a lot of things Walter Wheeler is well
off You do as I want you to pack your things and go to Baltimore
Bring Reynolds down here to look after the work until Im around again

But Dick evaded the direct issue thus opened and followed another line
of thought

Of course you understand he observed after a renewal of his restless
pacing that Ive got to tell her my situation first I dont need to
tell you that I funk doing it but its got to be done

Dont be a fool David said querulously Youll set a lot of women
cackling and what they dont know theyll invent I know em

Only herself and her family

Why

Because they have a right to know it

But when he saw David formulating a further protest he dropped the
subject

Ill not do it until weve gone into it together he promised
Theres plenty of time You settle down now and get ready for sleep

When the nurse came in at eleven oclock she found Dick gone and David
very still with his face to the wall

It was the end of May before David began to move about his upper room
The trees along the shaded streets had burst into full leaf by that
time and Mike was enjoying that gardeners interval of paradise when
flowers grow faster than the weeds among them Harrison Miller having
rolled his lawn through all of April was heard abroad in the early
mornings with the lawn mower or hoe in hand was to be seen behind his
house in his vegetable patch

Cars rolled through the streets the rear seats laden with blossoming
loot from the country lanes and the Wheeler dog was again burying bones
in the soft warm ground under the hedge

Elizabeth Wheeler was very happy Her look of expectant waiting once
vague had crystallized now into definite form She was waiting timidly
and shyly but with infinite content In time everything would come
And in the meantime there was today and some time today a shabby car
would stop at the door and there would be five minutes or ten And
then Dick would have to hurry to work or back to David After that of
course today was over but there would always be tomorrow

Now and then at choir practice or at service she saw Clare Rossiter
But Clare was very cool to her and never on any account sought her
or spoke to her alone She was rather unhappy about Clare when she
remembered her Because it must be so terrible to care for a man who
only said when one spoke of Clare Oh the tall blonde girl

Once or twice too she had found Clares eyes on her and they were
hostile eyes It was almost as though they said I hate you because you
know But dont dare to pity me

Yet somehow Elizabeth found herself not entirely believing that
Clares passion was real Because the real thing you hid with all
your might at least until you were sure it was wanted After that
of course you could be so proud of it that you might become utterly
shameless She was afraid sometimes that she was the sort to be utterly
shameless Yet for all her halcyon hours there were little things that
worried her Wallie Sayre for instance always having to be kept from
saying things she didnt want to hear And Nina She wasnt sure that
Nina was entirely happy And of course there was Jim

Jim was difficult Sometimes he was a man and then again he was a boy
and one never knew just which he was going to be He was too old for
discipline and too young to manage himself He was spending almost all
his evenings away from home now and her mother always drew an inaudible
sigh when he was spoken of

Elizabeth had waited up for him one night only a short time before and
beckoning him into her room had talked to him severely

You ought to be ashamed Jim she said Youre simply worrying mother
sick

Well why he demanded defiantly Im old enough to take care of
myself

You ought to be taking care of her too

He had looked rather crestfallen at that and before he went out he
offered a halfsheepish explanation

Id tell them where I go he said but youd think a pool room was on
the direct road to hell Take tonight now I cant tell them about it
but it was all right I met Wallie Sayre and Leslie at the club before
dinner and we got a fourth and played bridge Only half a cent a point
I swear we were going on playing but somebody brought in a chap
named Gregory for a cocktail He turned out to be a brother of Beverly
Carlysle the actress and he took us around to the theater and gave us
a box Not a thing wrong with it was there

Where did you go from there she persisted inexorably Its half past
one

Went around and met her Shes wonderful Elizabeth But do you know
what would happen if I told them Theyd have a fit

She felt rather helpless because she knew he was right from his own
standpoint

I know Im surprised at Les Jim

Oh Les He just trailed along Hes all right

She kissed him and he went out leaving her to lie awake for a long
time She would have had all her world happy those days and all her
world good She didnt want anybodys bread and butter spilled on the
carpet

So the days went on and the web slowly wove itself into its complicated
pattern Bassett speeding West and David in his quiet room Jim
and Leslie Ward seeking amusement and finding it in the littered
dressingroom of a woman star at a local theater Clare Rossiter
brooding and the little question being whispered behind hands
figuratively of coursethe village was entirely wellbred Gregory
calling round to see Bassett and turning away with the information that
he had gone away for an indefinite time and Maggie Donaldson lying in
the cemetery at the foot of the mountains outside Norada having shriven
her soul to the limit of her strength so that she might face her Maker

Out of all of them it was Clare Rossiter who made the first conscious
move of the shuttle Clare affronted and not a little malicious but
perhaps still dramatizing herself this time as the friend who
feels forced to carry bad tidings Behind even that however was
an unconscious desire to see Dick again and this time so to impress
herself on him that never again could he pass her in the street
unnoticed

On the day then that David first sat up in bed Clare went to the house
and took her place in the waitingroom She was dressed with extreme
care and she carried a parasol With it while she waited she drilled
small nervous indentations in the old office carpet and formulated her
line of action

Nevertheless she found it hard to begin

I dont want to keep you if youre busy she said avoiding his eyes
If you are in a hurry

This is my business he said patiently And waited

I wonder if you are going to understand me when I do begin

You sound alarmingly ominous He smiled at her and she had a moment
of panic You dont look like a young lady with anything eating at her
damask cheek or however it goes

Doctor Livingstone she said suddenly people are saying something
about you that you ought to know

He stared at her amazed and incredulous

About me What can they say Thats absurd

I felt you ought to know Of course I dont believe it Not for a
moment But you know what this town is

I know its a very good town he said steadily However lets have
it I daresay it is not very serious

She was uneasy enough by that time and rather frightened when she had
finished For he sat quiet and rather pale not looking at her at all
but gazing fixedly at an old daguerreotype of David that stood on his
desk One that Lucy had shown him one day and which he had preempted
David at the age of eight in a small black velvet suit and with very
thin legs

I thought you ought to know she justified herself nervously

Dick got up

Yes he said I ought to know of course Thank you

When she had gone he went back and stood before the picture again From
Clares first words he had had a stricken conviction that the thing was
true that as Mrs Cook Morgans visitor from Wyoming had insisted
Henry Livingstone had never married never had a son He stood and gazed
at the picture His world had collapsed about him but he was steady and
very erect

David David he thought Why did you do it And what am I And who

Characteristically his first thought after that was of David himself
Whatever David had done his motive had been right He would have to
start with that If David had built for him a false identity it was
because there was a necessity for it Something shameful something he
was to be taken away from Wasnt it probable that David had heard the
gossip and had then collapsed Wasnt the fear that he himself would
hear it behind Davids insistence that he go to Baltimore

His thoughts flew to Elizabeth Everything was changed now as to
Elizabeth He would have to be very certain of that past of his before
he could tell her that he loved her and he had a sense of immediate
helplessness He could not go to David as things were To Lucy

Probably he would have gone to Lucy at once but the telephone rang
He answered it got his hat and bag and went out to the car Years with
David had made automatic the subordination of self to the demands of the
practice

At half past six Lucy heard him come in and go into his office When he
did not immediately reappear and take his flying run up the stairs to
Davids room she stood outside the office door and listened She had a
premonition of something wrong something of the truth perhaps Anyhow
she tapped at the door and opened it to find him sitting very quietly
at his desk with his head in his hands

Dick she exclaimed Is anything wrong

I have a headache he said He looked at his watch and got up Ill
take a look at David and then well have dinner I didnt know it was
so late

But when she had gone out he did not immediately move He had been going
over again painfully and carefully the things that puzzled him that
he had accepted before without dispute David and Lucys reluctance to
discuss his father the long days in the cabin with David helping him
to reconstruct his past the spring and that slow progress which now he
felt somehow had been an escape

He ate very little dinner and Lucys sense of dread increased When
after the meal she took refuge in her sittingroom on the lower floor
and picked up her knitting it was with a conviction that it was only a
temporary reprieve She did not know from what

She heard him some time later coming down from Davids room But he
did not turn into his office Instead he came on to her door stood for
a moment like a man undecided then came in She did not look up even
when very gently he took her knitting from her and laid it on the table

Aunt Lucy

Yes Dick

Dont you think wed better have a talk

What about she asked with her heart hammering

About me He stood above her and looked down still with the
tenderness with which he always regarded her but with resolution in his
very attitude First of all Ill tell you something Then Ill ask you
to tell me all you can

She yearned over him as he told her for all her terror His voice for
all its steadiness was strained

I have felt for some time he finished that you and David were
keeping something from me I think now that this is what it was Of
course you realize that I shall have to know

Dick Dick was all she could say

I was about he went on with his almost terrible steadiness to ask
a girl to take my name I want to know if I have a name to offer her I
have you see only two alternatives to believe about myself Either
I am Henry Livingstones illegitimate son and in that case I have no
right to my name or to offer it to any one or I am

He made a despairing gesture

or I am some one else some one who was smuggled out of the mountains
and given an identity that makes him a living lie

Always she had known that this might come some time but always too she
had seen David bearing the brunt of it He should bear it It was not
of her doing or of her approving For years the danger of discovery had
hung over her like a cloud

Do you know which he persisted

Yes Dick

Would you have the unbelievable cruelty not to tell me

She got up a taut little figure with a dignity born of her fear and of
her love for him

I shall not betray Davids confidence she said Long ago I warned
him that this time would come I was never in favor of keeping you
in ignorance But it is Davids problem and I cannot take the
responsibility of telling you

He knew her determination and her obstinate loyalty But he was fairly
desperate

You know that if you dont tell me I shall go to David

If you go now you will kill him

Its as bad as that is it he asked grimly Then there is something
shameful behind it is there

No no Dick Not that And I want you always to remember this What
David did was out of love for you He has made many sacrifices for you
First he saved your life and then he made you what you are And he has
had a great pride in it Dont destroy his work of years

Her voice broke and she turned to go out her chin quivering but half
way to the door he called to her

Aunt Lucy he said gently

She heard him behind her felt his strong arms as he turned her about
He drew her to him and stooping kissed her cheek

Youre right he said Always right Ill not worry him with it My
word of honor When the time comes hell tell me and until it comes
Ill wait And I love you both Dont ever forget that

He kissed her again and let her go

But long after David had put down his prayerbook that night and
after the nurse had rustled down the stairs to the night supper on the
diningroom table Lucy lay awake and listened to Dicks slow pacing of
his bedroom floor

He was very gentle with David from that time on and tried to return
to his old lighthearted ways On the day David was to have his first
broiled sweetbread he caught the nurse outside borrowed her cap and
apron and carried in the tray himself

I hope your food is to your taste Doctor David he said in a high
falsetto which set the nurse giggling in the hall I may not be much of
a nurse but I can cook

Even Lucy was deceived at times He went his customary round sent out
the monthly bills opened and answered Davids mail bore the double
burden of Davids work and his own ungrudgingly but off guard he was
grave and abstracted He began to look very thin too and Lucy often
heard him pacing the floor at night She thought that he seldom or never
went to the Wheelers

And so passed the tenth day of Davids illness with the smile on
Elizabeths face growing a trifle fixed as three days went by without
the shabby car rattling to the door with The Valley playing its
second and final week before going into New York and with Leslie Ward
unconsciously taking up the shuttle Clare had dropped and carrying the
pattern one degree further toward completion




XIV

JUST how Leslie Ward had drifted into his innocuous affair with the star
of The Valley he was not certain himself Innocuous it certainly was
Afterwards looking back he was to wonder sometimes if it had not been
precisely for the purpose it served But that was long months after
Not until the pattern was completed and he was able to recognize his own
work in it

The truth was that he was not too happy at home Ninas smart little
house on the Ridgely Road had at first kept her busy She had spent
unlimited time with decorators had studied and rejected innumerable
watercolor sketches of interiors had haunted auction rooms and bid
recklessly on things she felt at the moment she could not do without
later on to have to wheedle Leslie into straightening her bank balance
Thought too and considerable energy had gone into training and
outfitting her servants and still more into inducing them to wear the
expensive uniforms and livery she provided

But what she made so successfully was a house rather than a home
There were times indeed when Leslie began to feel that it was not even
a house but a small hotel They almost never dined alone and when they
did Nina would explain that everybody was tied up Then after dinner
restlessness would seize her and she would want to run in to the
theater or to make a call If he refused she nursed a grievance all
evening

And he did not like her friends Things came to a point where when
he knew one of the gay evenings was on he would stay in town playing
billiards at his club or occasionally wandering into a theater where
he stood or sat at the back of the house and watched the play with
cynical discontented eyes

The casual meeting with Gregory and the introduction to his sister
brought a new interest Perhaps the very novelty was what first
attracted him the oddity of feeling that he was on terms of friendship
for it amounted to that with surprising quickness with a famous
woman whose face smiled out at him from his morning paper or huge and
shockingly colored from the sheets on the bill boards

He formed the habit of calling on her in the afternoons at her hotel
and he saw that she liked it It was often lonely she explained He
sent her flowers and cigarettes and he found her poised and restful
and sometimes when she was off guard with the lines of old suffering
in her face

She sat still She didnt fidget as Nina did She listened too
She was not as beautiful as she appeared on the stage but she was
attractive and he stilled his conscience with the knowledge that she
placed no undue emphasis on his visits In her world men came and went
brought or sent small tribute and she was pleased and grateful No
more The next week or the week after and other men in other places
would be doing the same things

But he wondered about her sometimes Did she ever think of Judson
Clark and the wreck he had made of her life What of resentment
and sorrow lay behind her quiet face or the voice with its careful
intonations which was so unlike Ninas

Now and then he saw her brother He neither liked nor disliked Gregory
but he suspected him of rather bullying Beverly On the rare occasions
when he saw them together there was a sort of nervous tension in the
air and although Leslie was not subtle he sensed some hidden difference
between them A small incident one day almost brought this concealed
dissension to a head He said to Gregory

By the way I saw you in Haverly yesterday afternoon

Must have seen somebody else Haverly Wheres Haverly

Leslie Ward had been rather annoyed There had been no mistake about the
recognition But he passed it off with that curious sense of sex loyalty
that will actuate a man even toward his enemies

Funny he said Chap looked like you Maybe a little heavier

Nevertheless he had a conviction that he had said something better left
unsaid and that Beverly Carlysles glance at her brother was almost
hostile He had that instantaneous picture of the two of them the man
defiant and somehow frightened and the womans eyes anxious and yet
slightly contemptuous Then in a flash it was gone

He had meant to go home that evening would have probably for he was
not ignorant of where he was drifting But when he went back to the
office Nina was on the wire with the news that they were to go with a
party to a country inn

For chicken and waffles Les she said It will be oceans of fun And
Ive promised the cocktails

Im tired he replied sulkily And why dont you let some of the
other fellows come over with the drinks It seems to me Im always the
goat

Oh if thats the way you feel Nina said and hung up the receiver

He did not go home He went to the theater and stood at the back with
his sense of guilt deadened by the knowledge that Nina was having what
she would call a heavenly time After all it would soon be over He
counted the days The Valley had only four more before it moved on

He had already played his small part in the drama that involved Dick
Livingstone but he was unaware of it He went home that night to
find Nina settled in bed and very sulky and he retired himself in no
pleasant frame of mind But he took a firmer hold of himself that night
before he slept He didnt want a smash and yet they might be headed
that way He wouldnt see Beverly Carlysle again

He lived up to his resolve the next day bought his flowers as usual
but this time for Nina and took them with him And went home with the
orchids which were really an offering to his own conscience

But Nina was not at home The butler reported that she was dining at
the Wheelers and he thought the man eyed him with restrained
commiseration

Did she say I am expected there he asked

She ordered dinner for you here sir

Even for Nina that sounded odd He took his coat and went out again to
the car after a moments hesitation he went back and got the orchids

Dick Livingstones machine was at the curb before the Wheeler house
and in the livingroom he found Walter Wheeler pacing the floor Mr
Wheeler glanced at him and looked away

Anybody sick Leslie asked his feeling of apprehension growing

Nina is having hysterics upstairs Mr Wheeler said and continued his
pacing

Nina Hysterics

Thats what I said replied Mr Wheeler suddenly savage Youve made
a nice mess of things havent you

Leslie placed the box of orchids on the table and drew off his gloves
His mind was running over many possibilities

Youd better tell me about it hadnt you

Oh I will Dont worry Ive seen this coming for months Im not
taking her part God knows I know her and she has as much idea of
making a home asashe looked aboutas that poker has But thats
the worst you can say of her As to you

Well

Mr Wheelers anxiety was greater than his anger He lowered his voice

She got a bill today for two or three boxes of flowers sent to some
actress And when Leslie said nothing Im not condoning it mind you
Youd no business to do it But he added fretfully why the devil
if youve got to act the fool dont you have your bills sent to your
office

I suppose I dont need to tell you thats all there was to it Flowers
I mean

Im taking that for granted But she says she wont go back

Leslie was aghast and frightened Not at the threat she would go back
of course But she would always hold it against him She cherished small
grudges faithfully And he knew she would never understand never see
her own contribution to his mild defection nor comprehend the actual
innocence of those afternoons of tea and talk

There was no sound from upstairs Mr Wheeler got his hat and went out
calling to the dog Jim came in whistling looked in and said Hello
Les and disappeared He sat in the growing twilight and cursed himself
for a fool After all where had he been heading A man couldnt eat his
cake and have it But he was resentful too he stressed rather hard his
own innocence and chose to ignore the less innocent impulse that lay
behind it

After a half hour or so he heard some one descending and Dick
Livingstone appeared in the hall He called to him and Dick entered the
room Before he sat down he lighted a cigarette and in the flare of
the match Leslie got an impression of fatigue and of something new of
trouble But his own anxieties obsessed him

Shes told you about it I suppose

I was a fool of course But it was only a matter of a few flowers
and some afternoon calls Shes a fine woman Livingstone and she is
lonely The women have given her a pretty cold deal since the Clark
story They copy her clothes and her walk but they dont ask her into
their homes

Isnt the trouble more fundamental than that Ward I was thinking
about it upstairs Nina was pretty frank She says youve had your good
time and want to settle down and that she is young and now is her only
chance Later on there may be children you know She blames herself
too but she has a fairly clear idea of how it happened

Do you think shell go back home

She promised she would

They sat smoking in silence In the diningroom Annie was laying the
table for dinner and a most untragic odor of new garden peas began
to steal along the hall Dick suddenly stirred and threw away his
cigarette

I was going to talk to you about something else he said but this is
hardly the time Ill get on home He rose Shell be all right Only
Id advise very tactful handling andthe fullest explanation you can
make

What is it Id be glad to have something to keep my mind occupied
Its eating itself up just now

Its a personal matter

Ward glanced up at him quickly

Yes

Have you happened to hear a story that I believe is going round One
that concerns me

Well I have Leslie admitted I didnt pay much attention Nobody is
taking it very seriously

Thats not the point Dick persisted I dont mind idle gossip I
dont give a damn about it Its the statement itself

I should say that you are the only person who knows anything about it

Dick made a restless impatient gesture

I want to know one thing more he said Nina told you I suppose
DoesI suppose Elizabeth knows it too

I rather think she does

Dick turned abruptly and went out of the room and a moment later
Leslie heard the front door slam Elizabeth standing at the head of the
stairs heard it also and turned away with a new droop to her usually
valiant shoulders Her world too had gone awry that safe world of
protection and cheer and kindliness First had come Nina whitelipped
and shaken and Elizabeth had had to face the fact that there were such
things as treachery and the queer hidden things that men did and that
came to light and brought horrible suffering

And that afternoon she had had to acknowledge that there was something
wrong with Dick No Between Dick and herself There was a formality in
his speech to her an aloofness that seemed to ignore utterly their new
intimacy He was there but he was miles away from her She tried hard
to feel indignant but she was only hurt

Peace seemed definitely to have abandoned the Wheeler house Then
late in the evening a measure of it was restored when Nina and Leslie
effected a reconciliation It followed several bad hours when Nina had
locked her door against them all but at ten oclock she sent for Leslie
and faced him with desperate calmness

To Elizabeth putting cold cloths on her mothers head as she lay on the
bed there came a growing conviction that the relation between men and
women was a complicated and baffling thing and that love and hate were
sometimes close together

Love and habit perhaps triumphed in Ninas case however for at
eleven oclock they heard Leslie going down the stairs and later on
moving about the kitchen and pantry while whistling softly The servants
had gone and the air was filled with the odor of burning bread Some
time later Mrs Wheeler waiting uneasily in the upper hall beheld her
soninlaw coming up and carrying proudly a tray on which was toast of
an incredible blackness and a pot which smelled feebly of tea

The next time youre out of a cook just send for me he said
cheerfully

Mrs Wheeler full and overflowing with indignation and the piece of her
mind she had meant to deliver retired vanquished to her bedroom

Late that night when Nina had finally forgiven him and had settled down
for sleep Leslie went downstairs for a cigar to find Elizabeth sitting
there alone a book on her knee face down and her eyes wistful and
with a question in them

Sitting and thinking or just sitting he inquired

I was thinking

Aircastles eh Well be sure you put the right man into them He
felt more or less a fool for having said that for it was extremely
likely that Ninas family was feeling some doubt about Ninas choice

What I mean is he added hastily dont be a fool and take Wallie
Sayre Take a man while youre about it

I would if I could do the taking

Thats piffle Elizabeth He sat down on the arm of a chair and looked
at her Look here what about this story the Rossiter girl and a few
others are handing around about Dick Livingstone Youre not worrying
about it are you

I dont believe its true and it wouldnt matter to me anyhow

Good for you he said heartily and got up Youd better go to bed
young lady Its almost midnight

But although she rose she made no further move to go

What I am worrying about is this Leslie He may hear it

He has heard it honey

He had expected her to look alarmed but instead she showed relief

Ill tell you the truth Les she said I was worrying Im terribly
fond of him It just came all at once and I couldnt help it And I
thought he liked me too that way She stopped and looked up at him to
see if he understood and he nodded gravely Then today when he came
to see Nina he avoided me HeI was waiting in the hall upstairs and
he just said a word or two and went on down

Poor devil Leslie said You see hes in an unpleasant position to
say the least But heres a thought to go to sleep on If you ask me
hes keeping out of your way not because he cares too little but
because he cares too much

Long after a repentant and chastened Leslie had gone to sleep his arm
over Ninas unconscious shoulder Elizabeth stood wideeyed on the
tiny balcony outside her room From it in daylight she could see
the Livingstone house Now it was invisible but an upper window was
outlined in the light Very shyly she kissed her finger tips to it

Goodnight dear she whispered

Louis Bassett had left for Norada the day after Davids sudden illness
but ten days later found him only as far as Chicago and laid up in his
hotel with a sprained knee It was not until the day Nina went back to
the little house in the Ridgely Road having learned the first lesson of
married life that men must not only be captured but also held that he
was able to resume his journey

He had chafed wretchedly under the delay It was true that nothing in
the way of a story had broken yet The Tribune had carried a photograph
of the cabin where Clark had according to the Donaldson woman spent the
winter following the murder and there were the usual reports that he
had been seen recently in spots as diverse as Seattle and New Orleans
But when the following Sunday brought nothing further he surmised that
the pack having lost the scent had been called off

He confirmed this before starting West by visiting some of the offices
of the leading papers and looking up old friends The Clark story was
dead for the time They had run a lot of pictures of him however and
some one might turn him up eventually but a scent was pretty cold in
ten years The place had changed too Oil had been discovered five
years ago and the old settlers had a good many of them cashed in and
moved away The town had grown like all oil towns

Bassett was fairly content He took the night train out of Chicago and
spent the next day crossing Nebraska fertile rich and interesting On
the afternoon of the second day he left the train and took a branch
line toward the mountains and Norada and from that time on he became an
urbane interested and generally cigarsmoking interrogation point

Railroad been here long he asked the conductor

Four years

Norada must have been pretty isolated before that

Thirty miles in a coach or a Ford car

I was reading the other day said Bassett about the Judson Clark
case Have a cigar Got time to sit down

You a newspaper man

Oil well supplies said Bassett easily Well in this article it
seemed some woman or other had made a confession It sounded fishy to
me

Well Ill tell you about that The conductor sat down and bit off the
end of his cigar I knew the Donaldsons well and Maggie Donaldson was
an honest woman But Ill tell you how I explain the thing Donaldson
died and that left her pretty much alone The executors of the Clark
estate kept her on the ranch but when the estate was settled three
years ago she had to move That broke her all up Shes always said he
wasnt dead She kept the house just as it was and my wife says she had
his clothes all ready and everything

That rather sounds as though the story is true doesnt it

Not necessarily Its my idea she got from hoping to moping so to
speak She went in to town regular for letters for ten years and the
postmaster says she never got any She was hurt in front of the post
office The talk around here is that shes been off her head for the
last year or two

But they found the cabin

Sure they did said the conductor equably The cabin was no secret
It was an old fire station before they put the new one on Goat Mountain
I spent a month in it myself once with a dude who wanted to take
pictures of bear We found a bear but it charged the camera and Id be
running yet if I hadnt come to civilization

When he had gone Bassett fell into deep thought So Maggie Donaldson
had gone to the post office for ten years He tried to visualize those
faithful wearisome journeys through spring mud and winter snow always
futile and always hopeful He did not for a moment believe that she had
gone off her head She had been faithful to the end as some women
were and in the end too as had happened before her faith had killed
her

And again he wondered at the curious ability of some men to secure
loyalty They might go through life tearing down ideals and destroying
illusions to the last but always there was some faithful hand to
rebuild some faithful soul to worship

He was somewhat daunted at the size and bustling activity of Norada
Its streets were paved and welllighted there were a park and a public
library and the clerk at the Commercial Hotel asked him if he wished
a private bath But the development was helpful in one way In the
old Norada a newcomer might have been subjected to a friendly but
inquisitive interest In this grownup and selfcentered community a man
might come and go unnoticed

And he had other advantages The pack as he cynically thought of them
would have started at the Clark ranch and the cabin He would get to
them of course but he meant to start on the outside of the circle and
work in

Been here long he asked the clerk at the desk after a leisurely
meal

The clerk grinned

I came here two years ago I never saw Jud Clark To get to the Clark
place take the road north out of the town and keep straight about eight
miles The roads good now You fellows have worn it smooth

Must have written that down and learned it off Bassett said
admiringly What the devils the Clark place And why should I go
there Unless he added they serve a decent meal

Sorry The clerk looked at him sharply was satisfied and picked up a
pen Youll hear the story if you stay around here any time Anything I
can do for you

Yes Fire the cook Bassett said and moved away

He spent the evening in going over his notes and outlining a campaign
and the next day he stumbled on a bit of luck His elderly chambermaid
had lived in and around the town for years

Ever hear of any Livingstones in these parts he asked

Why yes There used to be a Livingstone ranch at Dry River she said
pausing with her carpet sweeper and looking at him It wasnt much of
a place Although you cant tell these days I sold sixty acres eight
years ago for two thousand dollars and the folks that bought it are
getting a thousand a day out of it

She sighed She had touched the hem of fortunes garment and passed on
for some opportunity knocked but faintly and for others it burst open
the door and forced its way in

Id be a millionaire now if Id held on she said somberly That day
Bassett engaged a car by the day he to drive it himself and return it
in good condition the garage to furnish tires

Id just like to say one thing the owner said as he tried the gears
I dont know where youre going and its not exactly my business Here
in the oil country where theyre cutting each others throats for new
leases we let a man alone But if youve any idea of taking that car by
the back road to the old fire station where Jud Clarks supposed to have
spent the winter Ill just say this weve had two stuck up there for a
week and the only way I see to get them back is a cyclone

Im going to Dry River Bassett said shortly

Dry Rivers right if youre looking for oil Go easy on the brakes
old man We need em in our business

Dry River was a small settlement away from the railroad It consisted
of two intersecting unpaved streets a dozen or so houses a closed and
empty saloon and two general stores He chose one at random and found
that the old Livingstone place had been sold ten years ago on the death
of its owner Henry Livingstone

His brother from the East inherited it said the storekeeper He came
and sold out lock stock and barrel Not that there was much A few
cattle and horses and the stuff in the ranch house which wasnt
valuable There were a lot of books and the brother gave them for a
library but we havent any building The railroad isnt built this far
yet and unless we get oil here it wont be

The brother inherited it eh Do you know the brothers name

David I think He was a doctor back East somewhere

Then this Henry Livingstone wasnt married Or at least had no
children

He wasnt married He was a sort of hermit Hed been dead two days
before any one knew it My wife went out when they found him and got him
ready for the funeral He was buried before the brother got here He
glanced at Bassett shrewdly The place has been prospected for oil and
theres a dry hole on the next ranch I tell my wife natures like the
railroad It quit before it got this far

Bassetts last scruple had fled The story was there ready for the
gathering So ready indeed that he was almost suspicious of his luck

And that conviction that things were coming too easy persisted through
his interview with the storekeepers wife in the small house behind the
store She was a talkative woman eager to discuss the one drama in
a drab life and she showed no curiosity as to the reason for his
question

Henry Livingstone she said Well I should say so I went out right
away when we got the word he was dead and there I stayed until it was
all over I guess I know as much about him as any one around here does
for I had to go over his papers to find out who his people were

The papers it seemed had not been very interesting canceled checks
and receipted bills and a large bundle of letters all of them from a
brother named David and a sister who signed herself Lucy There had
been a sealed one too addressed to David Livingstone and to be opened
after his death She had had her husband wire to David and he had come
out too late for the funeral

Do you remember when that was

Let me see Henry Livingstone died about a month before the murder at
the Clark ranch We date most things around here from that time

How long did David stay Bassett had tried to keep his tone
carefully conversational but he saw that it was not necessary She was
glad of a chance to talk

Well Id say about three or four weeks He hadnt seen his brother for
years and I guess there was no love lost He sold everything as quick
as he could and went back East She glanced at the clock My husband
will be in soon for dinner Id be glad to have you stay and take a meal
with us

The reporter thanked her and declined

Its an interesting story he said I didnt tell your husband for
I wasnt sure I was on the right trail But the David and Lucy business
eliminates this man Theres a piece of property waiting in the East
for a Henry Livingstone who came to this state in the 80s or for his
heirs You can say positively that this man was not married

No He didnt like women Never had one on the place Two ranch hands
that are still at the Wassons and himself that was all The Wassons
are the folks who bought the ranch

No housekeeper then and no son born out of wedlock so far as any
evidence went All that glib lying in the doctors office all that
apparent openness and frankness gone by the board The man in the
cabin reported by Maggie Donaldson had been David Livingstone
Somehow some way he had got Judson Clark out of the country and
spirited him East Not that the how mattered just yet The essential
fact was there that David Livingstone had been in this part of the
country at the time Maggie Donaldson had been nursing Judson Clark in
the mountains

Bassett sat back and chewed the end of his cigar thoughtfully The
sheer boldness of the scheme which had saved Judson Clark compelled his
admiration but the failure to cover the trail the ease with which he
had picked it up made him suspicious

He rose and threw away his cigar

You say this David went East when he had sold out the place Do you
remember where he lived

Some town in eastern Pennsylvania Ive forgotten the name

Ive got to be sure Im wrong and then go ahead he said as he got
his hat Ill see those men at the ranch I guess and then be on my
way How far is it

It was about ten miles along a bad road which kept him too much
occupied for any connected thought But his sense of exultation
persisted He had found Judson Clark




XVI

Dicks decision to cut himself off from Elizabeth was born of his
certainty that he could not see her and keep his head He was resolutely
determined to keep his head until he knew what he had to offer her But
he was very unhappy He worked sturdily all day and slept at night out
of sheer fatigue only to rouse in the early morning to a conviction
of something wrong before he was fully awake Then would come the
uncertainty and pain of full consciousness and he would lie with his
arms under his head gazing unblinkingly at the ceiling and preparing to
face another day

There was no prospect of early relief although David had not again
referred to his going away David was very feeble The look of him
sometimes sent an almost physical pain through Dicks heart But there
were times when he roused to something like his old spirit shouted for
tobacco frowned over his diet tray and fought Harrison Miller when he
came in to play cribbage in much his old tumultuous manner

Then one afternoon late in May when for four days Dick had not seen
Elizabeth suddenly he found the decision as to their relation taken out
of his hands and by Elizabeth herself

He opened the door one afternoon to find her sitting alone in the
waitingroom clearly very frightened and almost inarticulate He could
not speak at all at first and when he did his voice to his dismay was
distinctly husky

Is anything wrong he asked in a tone which was fairly sepulchral

Thats what I want to know Dick

Suddenly he found himself violently angry Not at her of course At
everything

Wrong he said savagely Yes Everything is wrong

Then he was angry She went rather pale

What have I done Dick

As suddenly as he had been fierce he was abject and ashamed Startled
too

You he said What have you done Youre the only thing thats right
in a wrong world You

He checked himself put down his baghe had just come inand closed
the door into the hall Then he stood at a safe distance from her and
folded his arms in order to be able to keep his headwhich shows how
strange the English language is

Elizabeth he said gravely Ive been a selfcentered fool I stayed
away because Ive been in trouble Im still in trouble for that
matter But it hasnt anything to do with you Not directly anyhow

Dont you think its possible that I know what it is

You do know

He was too absorbed to notice the new maturity in her face the brooding
maternity born of a profound passion To Elizabeth just then he was not
a man her man daily deciding matters of life and death but a worried
boy magnifying a trifle into importance

There is always gossip she said and the only thing one can do is to
forget it at once You ought to be too big for that sort of thing

Butsuppose it is true

What difference would it make

He made a quick movement toward her

There may be more than that I dont know Elizabeth he said his
eyes on hers I have always thoughtI cant go to David now

He was moved to go on To tell her of his lost youth of that strange
trick by which his mind had shut off those hidden years But he could
not He had a perfectly human fear of being abnormal in her eyes
precisely but greatly magnified the same instinct which had made him
inspect his new tie in daylight for fear it was too brilliant But
greater than that was his new fear that something neither happy nor
right lay behind him under lock and key in his memory

I want you to know this Dick she said That nothing no gossip or
anything can make any difference to me And Ive been terribly hurt
Weve been such friends YouIve been lying awake at night worrying

That went to his heart first and then to his head This might be all
all he was ever to have This hour and this precious and tender child
so brave in her declaration so simple and direct all his world in that
imitation mahogany chair

Youre all Ive got he said The one real thing in a world thats
going to smash I think I love you more than God

The same mood of accepting what he had without question and of refusing
to look ahead actuated him for the next few days He was incredibly
happy

He went about his work with his customary care and thoroughness for
long practice had made it possible for him to go on as though nothing
had happened to listen to querulous complaints and long lists of
symptoms and to write without error those scrawled prescriptions which
were so hopefully to cure Not that Dick himself believed greatly in
those empirical doses but he considered that the expectation of relief
was half the battle But that was the mind of him which went about
clothed in flesh of course and did its daily and nightly work and put
up a very fair imitation of Doctor Richard Livingstone But hidden away
was a heart that behaved in a highly unprofessional manner and sang
and dreamed and jumped at the sight of a certain small figure on the
street and generally played hob with systole and diastole and the
vagus and accelerator nerves Which are all any doctor really knows
about the heart until he falls in love

He even began to wonder if he had read into the situation something
that was not there and in this his consciousness of Davids essential
rectitude helped him David could not do a wrong thing or an unworthy
one He wished he were more like David

The new humility extended to his love for Elizabeth Sometimes in his
room or shaving before the bathroom mirror he wondered what she could
see in him to care about He shaved twice a day now and his face was so
sore that he had to put cream on it at night to his secret humiliation
When he was dressed in the morning he found himself once or twice
taking a final survey of the ensemble and at those times he wished very
earnestly that he had some outstanding quality of appearance that she
might admire

He refused to think He was content for a time simply to feel to be
supremely happy to live each day as it came and not to look ahead And
the old house seemed to brighten with him Never had Lucys window boxes
been so bright or Minnies bread so light the sun poured into Davids
sick room and turned the nurse so dazzling white in her uniform that
David declared he was suffering from snowblindness

And David himself was improving rapidly With the passage of each day
he felt more secure The reporter from the TimesRepublicanif he were
really on the trail of Dick he would have come to see him would have
told him the story No That bridge was safely crossed And Dick was
happy David lying in his bed would listen and smile faintly when Dick
came whistling into the house or leaped up the stairs two at a time
when he sang in his shower or tormented the nurse with highspirited
nonsense The boy was very happy He would marry Elizabeth Wheeler and
things would be as they should be there would be the fullness of life
young voices in the house toys on the lawn He himself would pass on
in the fullness of time but Dick

On Decoration Day they got him out of bed making a great ceremony
of it and when he was settled by the window in his big chair with a
blanket over his knees Dick came in with a great box Unwrapping it
he disclosed a mass of paper and a small box and within that still
another

What folderol is all this David demanded fiercely with a childish
look of expectation in his eyes Give me that box Some more slippers
probably

He worked eagerly and at last he came to the small core of the mass It
was a cigar

It was somewhat later when the peace of good tobacco had relaxed him
into a sort of benignant drowsiness and when Dick had started for his
late afternoon calls that Lucy came into the room

Elizabeth Wheelers downstairs she said I told her you wanted to
see her Shes brought some chicken jelly too

She gathered up the tissue paper that surrounded him and gave the room
a critical survey She often felt that the nurse was not as tidy as she
might be Then she went over to him and put a hand on his shoulder

I dont want to worry you David Not now But if hes going to marry
her

Well why shouldnt he he demanded truculently A good woman would
be one more anchor to windward

She found that she could not go on David was always incomprehensible to
her when it came to Dick Had been incomprehensible from the first
But she could not proceed without telling him that the village knew
something and what that something was that already she felt a change
in the local attitude toward Dick He was for one thing not quite so
busy as he had been

She went out of the room and sent Elizabeth to David

In her love for Dick Elizabeth now included everything that pertained
to him his shabby coats his rattling car and his people She had
an inarticulate desire for their endorsement to be liked by them and
wanted by them Not that there could be any words because both she and
Dick were content just then with love and were holding it very secret
between them

Well well said David And here we are reversed and Im the patient
and youre the doctor And good medicine you are my dear

He looked her over with approval and with speculation too She was a
small and fragile vessel on which to embark all the hopes that out of
his own celibate and unfulfilled life he had dreamed for Dick She was
even more than that If Lucy was right from now on she was a part
of that experiment in a human soul which he had begun with only a
professional interest but which had ended by becoming a vital part of
his own life

She was a little shy with him he saw rather fluttered and nervous yet
radiantly happy The combination of these mixed emotions plus her best
sickroom manner made her slightly prim at first But soon she was
telling him the small news of the village although David rather
suspected her of listening for Dicks car all the while When she got up
to go and held out her hand he kept it between both of his

I havent been studying symptoms for all these years for nothing my
dear he said And it seems to me somebody is very happy

I am Doctor David

He patted her hand

Mind you he said I dont know anything and Im not asking any
questions But if the Board of Trade or the Chief of Police had come
to me and said Who is the best wife forwell for a young man who
is an important part of this community Id have said in reply
Gentlemen there is a Miss Elizabeth Wheeler who

Suddenly she bent down and kissed him

Oh do you think so she asked breathlessly I love him so much
Doctor David And I feel so unworthy

So you are he said Sos he So are all of us when it comes to a
great love child That is we are never quite what the other fellow
thinks we are Its when we dont allow for what the scientist folk call
a margin of error that we come our croppers I wonderhe watched her
closelyif you young people ever allow for a margin of error

I only know this she said steadily I cant imagine ever caring any
less Ive never thought about myself very much but I do know that You
see I think Ive cared for a long time

When she had gone he sat in his chair staring ahead of him and thinking
Yes She would stick She had loyalty loyalty and patience and a rare
humility It was up to Dick then And again he faced the possibility of
an opening door into the past of crowding memories of confusion and
despair and even actual danger And out of that what

Habit That was all he had to depend on The brain was a thing of
habits like the body right could be a habit and so could evil As a
man thought so he was For all of his childhood and for the last ten
years Dicks mental habits had been right his environment had been
love his teaching responsibility Even if the door opened then there
was only the evil thinking of two or three reckless years to combat
and the door might never open Happiness Lauler had said would keep it
closed and Dick was happy

When at five oclock the nurse came in with a thermometer he was asleep
in his chair his mouth slightly open and snoring valiantly Hearing
Dick in the lower hall she went to the head of the stairs her finger
to her lips

Dick nodded and went into the office The afternoon mail was lying
there and he began mechanically to open it His thoughts were
elsewhere

Now that he had taken the step he had so firmly determined not to take
certain things such as Clare Rossiters story Davids uneasiness his
own doubts no longer involved himself alone nor even Elizabeth and
himself They had become of vital importance to her family

There was no evading the issue What had once been only his own
misfortune mischance whatever it was had now become of vital
importance to an entire group of hitherto disinterested people He would
have to put his situation clearly before them and let them judge And he
would have to clarify that situation for them and for himself

He had had a weak moment or two He knew that some men many men went
to marriage with certain reticences meaning to wipe the slate clean and
begin again He had a mans understanding of such concealments But he
did not for a moment compare his situation with theirs even when the
temptation to seize his happiness was strongest No mere misconduct
but something hidden and perhaps terrible lay behind Davids strange
new attitude Lay too behind the break in his memory which he tried to
analyze with professional detachment The mind in such cases set up
its defensive machinery of forgetfulness not against the trivial but
against the unbearable

For the last day or two he had faced the fact that not only must he use
every endeavor to revive his past but that such revival threatened with
cruelty and finality to separate him from the present

With an open and unread letter in his hand he stared about the office
This place was his he had fought for it worked for it He had an
almost physical sense of unseen hands reaching out to drag him away
from it from David and Lucy and from Elizabeth And of himself holding
desperately to them all and to the believed commonplaceness of his
surroundings

He shook himself and began to read the letter

Dear Doctor I have tried to see you but understand you are laid
up Burn this as soon as youve read it Louis Bassett has started for
Norada and I advise your getting the person we discussed out of town as
soon as possible Bassett is up to mischief Im not signing this fully
for obvious reasons G

The Sayre house stood on the hill behind the town a long rather low
white house on Italian lines In summer until the family exodus to the
Maine Coast the brilliant canopy which extended out over the
terrace indicated as Harrison Miller put it that the family was in
residence Originally designed as a summer home Mrs Sayre now used it
the year round There was nothing there as there was in the town house
to remind her of the bitter days before her widowhood

She was a short heavy woman of fine taste in her house and of no taste
whatever in her clothing

I never know said Harrison Miller when I look up at the Sayre
place whether Im seeing Ann Sayre or an awning

She was not a shrewd woman nor a clever one but she was kindly in the
main tolerant and maternal She liked young people gave gay little
parties to which she wore her outlandish clothes of all colors and all
cuts lavished gifts on the girls she liked and was anxious to see
Wallie married to a good steady girl and settled down Between her son
and herself was a quiet but undemonstrative affection She viewed him
through eyes that had lost their illusion about all men years ago and
she had no delusions about him She had no idea that she knew all that
he did with his time and no desire to penetrate the veil of his private
life

He spends a great deal of money she said one day to her lawyer I
suppose in the usual ways But he is not quite like his father He has
real affections which his father hadnt If he marries the right girl
she can make him almost anything

She had her first inkling that he was interested in Elizabeth Wheeler
one day when the head gardener reported that Mr Wallace had ordered
certain roses cut and sent to the Wheeler house She was angry at first
for the roses were being saved for a dinner party Then she considered

Very well Phelps she said Do it And Ill select a plant also to
go to Mrs Wheeler

After all why not the Wheeler girl She had been carefully reared if
the Wheeler house was rather awful in spots and she was a gentle little
thing very attractive too especially in church And certainly Wallie
had been seeing a great deal of her

She went to the greenhouses and from there upstairs and into the rooms
that she had planned for Wallie and his bride when the time came She
was more content than she had been for a long time She was a lonely
woman isolated by her very grandeur from the neighborliness she craved
when she wanted society she had to ask for it by invitation Standing
inside the door of the boudoir her thoughts already at work on
draperies and furniture she had a vague dream of new young life
stirring in the big house of no more lonely evenings of the bustle and
activity of a family again

She wanted Wallie to settle down She was tired of paying his bills at
his clubs and at various hotels tired and weary of the days he lay in
bed all morning while his valet concocted various things to enable him
to pull himself together He had been four years sowing his wild oats
and now at twentyfive she felt he should be through with them

The south room could be the nursery

On Decoration Day as usual she did her dutiful best by the community
sent flowers to the cemetery and even stood through a chilly hour there
while services were read and taps sounded over the graves of those who
had died in three wars She felt very grateful that Wallie had come back
safely and that if only now he would marry and settle down all would be
well

The service left her emotionally untouched She was one of those women
who saw in war politics even religion only their reaction on
herself and her affairs She had taken the German deluge as a personal
affliction And she stood only stoically enduring while the village
soprano sang The Star Spangled Banner By the end of the service she
had decided that Elizabeth Wheeler was the answer to her problem

Rather under pressure Wallie lunched with her at the country club but
she found him evasive and not particularly happy

Youre twentyfive you know she said toward the end of a
discussion By thirty youll be too set in your habits too hard to
please

Im not going to marry for the sake of getting married mother

Of course not But you have a good bit of money Youll have much more
when Im gone And money carries responsibility with it

He glanced at her looked away rapped a fork on the table cloth

It takes two to make a marriage mother

He closed up after that but she had learned what she wanted

At three oclock that afternoon the Sayre limousine stopped in front of
Ninas house and Mrs Sayre in brilliant pink and a purple hat got
out Leslie lounging in a window made the announcement

Heres the Queen of Sheba he said Ill go upstairs and have a
headache if you dont mind

He kissed Nina and departed hastily He was feeling extremely gentle
toward Nina those days and rather smugly virtuous He considered that
his conscience had brought him back and not a very bad fright which was
the fact and he fairly exuded righteousness

It was the great ladys first call and Nina was considerably uplifted
It was for such moments as this one trained servants and put Irish lace
on their aprons and had decorators who stood off with their heads a
little awry and devised backgrounds for ones personality

What a delightful room said Mrs Sayre And how do you keep a maid
as trim as that

I must have service Nina replied The butlers marching in a parade
or something How nice of you to come and see our little place Its a
bandbox of course

Mrs Sayre sat down a gross disharmony in the room but a solid and not
unkindly woman for all that

My dear she said I am not paying a call Or not only that I came
to talk to you about something About Wallace and your sister

Nina was gratified and not a little triumphant

I see she said Do you mean that they are fond of one another

Wallace is Of course this talk is between ourselves butIm going
to be frank Nina I want Wallie to marry and I want him to marry soon
You and I know that the life of an unattached man about town is full of
temptations I want him to settle down Im lonely too but thats not
so important

Nina hesitated

I dont know about Elizabeth Shes fond of Wallie as who isnt But
lately

Yes

Well for the last few days I have been wondering She doesnt talk
you know But she has been seeing something of Dick Livingstone

Doctor Livingstone Shed be throwing herself away

Yes but shes like that I mean she isnt ambitious Weve always
expected her to throw herself away at least I have

A half hour later Leslie upstairs leaned over the railing to see if
there were any indications of departure The door was open and Mrs
Sayre evidently about to take her leave She was saying

Its very close to my heart Nina dear and I know you will be tactful
I havent stressed the material advantages but you might point them out
to her

A few moments later Leslie came downstairs Nina was sitting alone
thinking with a not entirely pleasant look of calculation on her face

Well he said What were you two plotting

Plotting Nothing of course

He looked down at her Now see here old girl he said you keep your
hands off Elizabeths affairs If I know anything shes making a damn
good choice and dont you forget it




XVIII

Dick stood with the letter in his hand staring at it Who was Bassett
Who was G What had the departure of whoever Bassett might be for
Norada to do with David And who was the person who was to be got out of
town

He did not go upstairs He took the letter into his private office
closed the door and sitting down at his desk turned his reading lamp on
it as though that physical act might bring some mental light

Reread the cryptic sentences began to take on meaning An unknown named
Bassett whoever he might be was going to Norada bent on mischief
and another unknown who signed himself G was warning David of that
fact But the mischief was designed not against David but against a
third unknown some one who was to be got out of town

David had been trying to get him out of townThe warning referred to
himself

His first impulse was to go to David and months later he was to wonder
what would have happened had he done so How far could Bassett have
gone What would have been his own decision when he learned the truth

For a little while then the shuttle was in Dicks own hand He went up
to Davids room and with his hand on the letter in his pocket carried
on behind his casual talk the debate that was so vital But David had
a headache and a slightly faster pulse and that portion of the pattern
was never woven

The association between anxiety and Davids illness had always been
apparent in Dicks mind but now he began to surmise a concrete shock a
person a telegram or a telephone call And after dinner that night he
went back to the kitchen

Minnie he inquired do you remember the afternoon Doctor David was
taken sick

Ill never forget it

Did he receive a telegram that day

Not that I know of He often answers the bell himself

Do you know whether he had a visitor just before you heard him fall

He had a patient yes A man

Who was it

I dont know He was a stranger to me

Do you remember what he looked like

Minnie reflected

He was a smallish man maybe thirtyfive or so she said I think he
had gaiters over his shoes or maybe light tops He was a nice appearing
person

How soon after that did you hear Doctor David fall

Right away First the door slammed and then he dropped

Poor old David Dick had not the slightest doubt now that David had
received some unfortunate news and that up there in his bedroom ever
since alone and helpless he had been struggling with some secret dread
he could not share with any one Not even with Lucy probably

Nevertheless Dick made a try with Lucy that evening

Aunt Lucy he said do you know of anything that could have caused
Davids collapse

What sort of thing she asked guardedly

A letter well say or a visitor

When he saw that she was only puzzled and thinking back he knew she
could not help him

Never mind he said I was feeling about for some cause Thats all

He was satisfied that Lucy knew no more than he did of Davids visitor
and that David had kept his own counsel ever since But the sense of
impending disaster that had come with the letter did not leave him He
went through his evening office hours almost mechanically with a part
of his mind busy on the puzzle How did it affect the course of action
he had marked out Wasnt it even more necessary than ever now to go to
Walter Wheeler and tell him how things stood He hated mystery He liked
to walk in the middle of the road in the sunlight But even stronger
than that was a growing feeling that he needed a sane and normal
judgment on his situation a fresh viewpoint and some unprejudiced
advice

He visited David before he left and he was very gentle with him In
view of this new development he saw David from a different angle facing
and dreading something imminent and it came to him with a shock that
he might have to clear things up to save David The burden whatever it
was was breaking him

He had telephoned and Mr Wheeler was waiting for him Walter Wheeler
thought he knew what was coming and he had well in mind what he was
going to say He had thought it over pacing the floor alone with the
dog at his heels He would say

I like and respect you Livingstone If youre worrying about what
these damned gossips say lets call it a day and forget it I know a
man when I see one and if its all right with Elizabeth its all right
with me

Things however did not turn out just that way Dick came in grave and
clearly preoccupied and the first thing he said was

I have a story to tell you Mr Wheeler After youve heard it and
given me your opinion on it Ill come to a matter thatwell that I
cant talk about now

If its the silly talk that I daresay youve heard

No I dont give a damn for talk But there is something else
Something I havent told Elizabeth and that Ill have to tell you

Walter Wheeler drew himself up rather stiffly Leslies defection was
still in his mind

Dont tell me youre tangled up with another woman

No At least I think not I dont know

It is doubtful if Walter Wheeler grasped many of the technicalities
that followed Dick talked and he listened nodding now and then and
endeavoring very hard to get the gist of the matter It seemed to him
curious rather than serious Certainly the mind was a strange thing He
must read up on it Now and then he stopped Dick with a question and
Dick would break in on his narrative to reply Thus once

Youve said nothing to Elizabeth at all About the walling off as you
call it

No At first I was simply ashamed of it I didnt want her to get the
idea that I wasnt normal

I see

Now as I tell you I begin to thinkIve told you that this walling
off is an unconscious desire to forget something too painful to
remember Its practically always that I cant go to her with just
that can I Ive got to know first what it is

Id begun to think there was an understanding between you

Dick faced him squarely

There is I didnt intend it In fact I was trying to keep away from
her I didnt mean to speak to her until Id cleared things up But it
happened anyhow I suppose the way those things always happen

It was Walter Wheelers own decision finally that he go to Norada
with Dick as soon as David could be safely left It was the letter which
influenced him Up to that he had viewed the situation with a certain
detachment now he saw that it threatened the peace of two households

Its a warning all right

Yes Undoubtedly

You dont recognize the name Bassett

No Ive tried of course

The result of some indecision was finally that Elizabeth should not be
told anything until they were ready to tell it all And in the end a
certain resentment that she had become involved in an unhappy situation
died in Walter Wheeler before Dicks white face and sunken eyes

At ten oclock the housedoor opened and closed and Walter Wheeler got
up and went out into the hall

Go on upstairs Margaret he said to his wife Ive got a visitor
He did not look at Elizabeth You settle down and be comfortable he
added and Ill be up before long Wheres Jim

I dont know He didnt go to Ninas

He started with you didnt he

Yes But he left us at the corner

They exchanged glances Jim had been worrying them lately Strange how
a man could go along for years his only worries those of business his
track a single one through comfortable fields where he reaped only what
he sowed And then his family grew up and involved him without warning
in new perplexities and new troubles Nina first then Jim and now this
strange story which so inevitably involved Elizabeth

He put his arm around his wife and held her to him

Dont worry about Jim mother he said Hes all right fundamentally
Hes going through the bad time between being a boy and being a man
Hes a good boy

He watched her moving up the stairs his eyes tender and solicitous To
him she was just mother He had never thought of another woman in all
their twentyfour years together

Elizabeth waited near him her eyes on his face

Is it Dick she asked in a low tone

Yes

You dont mind daddy do you

I only want you to be happy he said rather hoarsely You know that
dont you

She nodded and turned up her face to be kissed He knew that she had no
doubt whatever that this interview was to seal her to Dick Livingstone
for ever and ever She fairly radiated happiness and confidence He left
her standing there going back to the livingroom closed the door




XIX

Louis Bassett when he started to the old Livingstone ranch now
the Wasson place was carefully turning over in his mind Davids
participation in the escape of Judson Clark Certain phases of it were
quite clear provided one accepted the fact that following a heavy
snowfall an Easterner and a tenderfoot had gone into the mountains
alone under conditions which had caused the posse after Judson Clark to
turn back and give him up for dead

Had Donaldson sent him there knowing he was a medical man If he had
would Maggie Donaldson not have said so She had said a man outside
that she had at first thought was a member of the searching party
Evidently then Donaldson had not prepared her to expect medical
assistance

Take the other angle Say David Livingstone had not been sent for Say
he knew nothing of the cabin or its occupants until he stumbled on them
He had sold the ranch distributed his brothers books and apparently
the townspeople at Dry River believed that he had gone back home
Then what had taken him clearly alone and having certainly given the
impression of a departure for the East into the mountains To hunt To
hunt what that he went about it secretly and alone

Bassett was inclined to the Donaldson theory finally John Donaldson
would have been wanting a doctor and not wanting one from Norada He
might have heard of this Eastern medical man at Dry River have gone to
him with his story even have taken him part of the way The situation
was one that would have a certain appeal It was possible anyhow

But instead of clarifying the situation Bassetts visit at the
Wasson place brought forward new elements which fitted neither of the
hypotheses in his mind

To Wasson himself whom he met on horseback on the road into the ranch
he gave the same explanation he had given to the storekeepers wife
Wasson was a tall man in chaps and a Stetson and he was courteously
interested

Bill and Jake are still here he said Theyre probably in for dinner
now and Ill see you get a chance to talk to them I took them over
with the ranch Property you say Well I hope its better land than he
had here

He turned his horse and rode beside the car to the house

Comes a little late to do Henry Livingstone much good he said Hes
been lying in the Dry River graveyard for about ten years Not much
mourned either He was about as closemouthed and uncompanionable as
they make them

The description Wasson had applied to Henry Livingstone Bassett himself
applied to the two ranch hands later on during their interview It
could hardly have been called an interview at all indeed and after a
time Bassett realized that behind their taciturnity was suspicion They
were watching him undoubtedly he rather thought when he looked away
that once or twice they exchanged glances He was certain too that
Wasson himself was puzzled

Speak up Jake he said once irritably This gentleman has come a
long way Its a matter of some property

What sort of property Jake demanded Jake was the spokesman of the
two

Thats not important Bassett observed easily What we want to know
is if Henry Livingstone had any family

He had a brother

No one else

Then its up to me to trail the brother Bassett observed Either of
you remember where he lived

Somewhere in the East

Bassett laughed

Thats a trifle vague he commented goodhumoredly Didnt you boys
ever mail any letters for him

He was certain again that they exchanged glances but they continued
to present an unbroken front of ignorance Wasson was divided between
irritation and amusement

Whatd I tell you he asked Like master like man Ive been here ten
years and Ive never got a word about the Livingstones out of either of
them

Im a patient man Bassett grinned I suppose youll admit that one
of you drove David Livingstone to the train and that you had a fair
idea then of where he was going

He looked directly at Jake but Jakes face was a solid mask He made no
reply whatever

From that moment on Bassett was certain that David had not been driven
away from the ranch at all What he did not know and was in no way to
find out was whether the two ranch hands knew that he had gone into the
mountains or why He surmised back of their taciturnity a small mystery
of their own and perhaps a fear Possibly Davids going was as much a
puzzle to them as to him Conceivably during the hours together on the
range or during the winter snows for ten years they had wrangled and
argued over a disappearance as mysterious in its way as Judson Clarks

He gave up at last having learned certain unimportant facts that the
recluse had led a lonely life that he had never tried to make the place
more than carry itself that he was a student and that he had no other
peculiarities

Did he ever say anything that would lead you to believe that he had any
family outside of his brother and sister That is any direct heir
Bassett asked

He never talked about himself said Jake If thats all Mr Wasson
Ive got a steer bogged down in the north pasture and Ill be going

On the Wassons invitation he remained to lunch and when the ranch
owner excused himself and rode away after the meal he sat for some
time on the verandah with Mrs Wasson sewing and his own eyes fixed
speculatively on the mountain range close bleak and mysterious

Strange thing he commented Heres a man a booklover and student
who comes out here not to make living and be a useful member of the
community but apparently to bury himself alive I wonder why

A great many come out here to get away from something Mr Bassett

Yes to start again But this man never started again He apparently
just quit

Mrs Wasson put down her sewing and looked at him thoughtfully

Did the boys tell you anything about the young man who visited Henry
Livingstone now and then

No They were not very communicative

I suppose they wouldnt tell Yet I dont see unless She stopped
lost in some field of speculation where he could not follow her You
know we havent much excitement here and when this boy was first seen
around the placehe was here mostly in the summerwe decided that he
was a relative I dont know why we considered him mysterious unless
it was because he was hardly ever seen I dont even know that that was
deliberate For that matter Mr Livingstone wasnt much more than a name
to us

You mean a son

Nobody knew He was here only now and then

Bassett moved in his chair and looked at her

How old do you suppose this boy was he asked

He was here at different times When Mr Livingstone died I suppose he
was in his twenties The thing that makes it seem odd to me is that the
men didnt mention him to you

I didnt ask about him of course

She went on with her sewing apparently intending to drop the matter
but the reporter felt that now and then she was subjecting him to a
sharp scrutiny and that in some shrewd womanfashion she was trying
to place him

You said it was a matter of some property

Yes

But its rather late isnt it Ten years

Thats what makes it difficult

There was another silence during which she evidently made her decision

I have never said this before except to Mr Wasson But I believe he
was here when Henry Livingstone died

Her tone was mysterious and Bassett stared at her

You dont think Livingstone was murdered

No He died of heart failure There was an autopsy But he had a bad
cut on his head Of course he may have fallenBill and Jake were away
Theyd driven some cattle out on the range It was two days before he
was found and it would have been longer if Mr Wasson hadnt ridden out
to talk to him about buying He found him dead in his bed but there was
blood on the floor in the next room I washed it up myself

Of course she added when Bassett maintained a puzzled silence I
may be all wrong He might have fallen in the next room and dragged
himself to bed But he was very neatly covered up

Its your idea then that this boy put him into the bed

I dont know He wasnt seen about the place Hes never been here
since But the posse found a horse with the Livingstone brand saddled
dead in Dry River Canyon when it was looking for Judson Clark Of
course that was a month later The men here Bill and Jake claimed it
had wandered off but Ive often wondered

After a time Bassett got up and took his leave He was confused and
irritated Here whether creditably or not was Dick Livingstone
accounted for There was a story there probably but not the story he
was after This unknown had been at the ranch when Henry Livingstone
died had perhaps been indirectly responsible for his death He had
witness the horse fled after the thing happened Later on then David
Livingstone had taken him into his family That was all

Except for that identification of Gregorys and for the photograph of
Judson Clark For a moment he wondered if the two Jud Clark and the
unknown could be the same But Dry River would have known Clark That
couldnt be

He almost ditched the car on his way back to Norada so deeply was he
engrossed in thought

On the seventh of June David and Lucy went to the seashore went by
the order of various professional gentlemen who had differed violently
during the course of Davids illness but who now suddenly agreed with
an almost startling unanimity Which unanimity was the result of careful
coaching by Dick

He saw in Davids absence his only possible chance to go back to Norada
without worry to the sick man and he felt too that a change getting
away from the surcharged atmosphere of the old house would be good for
both David and Lucy

For days before they started Lucy went about in a frenzy of nervous
energy writing out menus for Minnie for a month ahead counting and
recounting Davids collars and handkerchiefs cleaning and pressing his
neckties In the harness room in the stable Mike polished boots until
his arms ached and at the last moment with trunks already bulging
came three gift dressinggowns for David none of which he would leave
behind

I declare Lucy protested to Dick I dont know whats come over him
Every present hes had since he was sick hes taking along Youd think
he was going to be shut up on a desert island

But Dick thought he understood In Davids life his friends had had to
take the place of wife and children he clung to them now in his age
and weakness and Dick knew that he had a sense of deserting them of
abandoning them after many faithful years

So David carried with him the calendars and slippers dressinggowns and
bedsocks which were at once the tangible evidence of their friendliness
and Lucys despair

Watching him Dick was certain nothing further had come to threaten his
recovery Dick carefully inspected the mail but no suspicious letter
had arrived and as the days went on Davids peace seemed finally
reestablished He made no more references to Johns Hopkins slept like
a child and railed almost pettishly at his restricted diet

When we get away from Dick Lucy he would say well have beef
again and roast pork and sausage

Lucy would smile absently and shake her head

Youll stick to your diet David she would say David its the
strangest thing about your winter underwear Im sure you had five
suits and now there are only three

Or it was socks she missed or nightclothing And David inwardly
chuckling would wonder with her knowing all the while that they had
clothed some needy body

On the night before the departure David went out for his first short
walk alone and brought Elizabeth back with him

I found a rose walking up the street Lucy he bellowed up the stairs
and I brought it home for the dinner table

Lucy came down flushed from her final effort over the trunks but
gently hospitable

Its fish night Elizabeth she said You know Minnies a Catholic
so we always have fish on Friday I hope you eat it She put her hand
on Elizabeths arm and gently patted it and thus was Elizabeth taken
into the old brick house as one of its own

Elizabeth was finding this period of her tacit engagement rather
puzzling Her people puzzled her Even Dick did at times And nobody
seemed anxious to make plans for the future or even to discuss the
wedding She was a little hurt about that remembering the excitement
over Ninas

But what chiefly bewildered her was the seeming necessity for secrecy
Even Nina had not been told nor Jim She did not resent that although
it bewildered her Her own inclination was to shout it from the
housetops Her father had simply said Ive told your mother honey
and wed better let it go at that for a while Theres no hurry And I
dont want to lose you yet

But there were other things Dick himself varied He was always gentle
and very tender but there were times when he seemed to hold himself
away from her would seem aloof and remote but all the time watching
her almost fiercely But after that as though he had tried an
experiment in separation and failed with it he would catch her to him
savagely and hold her there She tried very meekly to meet his mood
was submissive to his passion and acquiescent to those intervals when
he withdrew himself and sat or stood near her not touching her but
watching her intently

She thought men in love were very queer and quite incomprehensible
Because he varied in other ways too He was boyish and gay sometimes
and again silent and almost brooding She thought at those times that
perhaps he was tired what with Davids work and his own and sometimes
she wondered if he were still worrying about that silly story But once
or twice after he had gone she went upstairs and looked carefully into
her mirror Perhaps she had not looked her best that day Girllike she
set great value on looks in love She wanted frightfully to be beautiful
to him She wished she could look like Beverly Carlysle for instance

Two days before David and Lucys departure he had brought her her
engagement ring a squarecut diamond set in platinum He kissed it
first and then her finger and slipped it into place It became a rite
done as he did it and she had a sense of something done that could
never be undone When she looked up at him he was very pale

Forsaking all others so long as we both shall live he said
unsteadily

So long as we both shall live she repeated

However she had to take it off later for Mrs Wheeler it developed
had very pronounced ideas of engagement rings They were put on the day
the notices were sent to the newspapers and not before So Elizabeth
wore her ring around her neck on a white ribbon inside her camisole
until such time as her father would consent to announce that he was
about to lose her

Thus Elizabeth found her engagement full of unexpected turns and twists
and nothing precisely as she had expected But she accepted things
as they came being of the type around which the dramas of life are
enacted while remaining totally undramatic herself She lived her quiet
days worried about Jim on occasion hemmed table napkins for her linen
chest and slept at night with her ring on her finger and a sense of
being wrapped in protecting love that was no longer limited to the white
Wheeler house but now extended two blocks away and around the corner to
a shabby old brick building in a more or less shabby yard

They were very gay in the old brick house that night before the
departure very noisy over the fish and Davids broiled lamb chop Dick
demanded a bottle of Lucys homemade wine and even David got a little
of it They toasted the seashore and the departed nurse and David
quoted Robert Burns at some length and in a horrible Scotch accent
Then Dick had a trick by which one read the date on one of three pennies
while he was not looking and he could tell without failing which one
it was It was most mysterious And after dinner Dick took her into his
laboratory and while she squinted one eye and looked into the finder of
his microscope he kissed the white nape of her neck

When they left the laboratory there were patients in the waitingroom
but he held her in his arms in the office for a moment or two very
quietly and because the door was thin they made a sort of game of it
and pretended she was a patient

How did you sleep last night he said in a highly professional and
very distinct voice Then he kissed her

Very badly doctor she said also very clearly and whispered I lay
awake and thought about you dear

Id better give you this sleeping powder Oh frightfully
professional but the powder turned out to be another kiss It was a
wonderful game

When she slipped out into the hall she had to stop and smooth her hair
before she went to Lucys tidy sittingroom




XXI

It was Jim Wheelers turn to take up the shuttle A girl met in
some casual fashion his own youth and the urge of it perhaps the
unconscious family indulgence of an only sonand Jim wove his bit and
passed on

There had been mild contention in the Wheeler family during all the
spring Looking out from his quiet windows Walter Wheeler saw the young
world going by awheel and going fast Much that legitimately belonged
to it and much that did not in the laxness of the new code he laid to
the automobile And doggedly he refused to buy one

We can always get a taxicab was his imperturbable answer to Jim I
pay pretty goodsized taxi bills without unpleasant discussion I know
you pretty well too Jim Better than you know yourself And if you had
a car youd try your best to break your neck in it

Now and then Jim got a car however Sometimes he rented one sometimes
he cajoled Nina into lending him hers

A fellow looks a fool without one he would say to her Girls expect
to be taken out Its part of the game

And Nina always reached by that argument of how things looked now and
then reluctantly acquiesced But a night or two after David and Lucy had
started for the seashore Nina came in like a whirlwind and routed the
family peace immediately

Father she said you just must speak to Jim Hes taken our car
twice at night without asking for it and last night he broke a spring
Les is simply crazy

Taken your car Mrs Wheeler exclaimed

Yes I hate telling on him but I spoke to him after the first time
and he did it anyhow

Mrs Wheeler glanced at her husband uneasily She often felt he was too
severe with Jim

Dont worry he said grimly Hell not do it again

If we only had a car of our own Mrs Wheeler protested

You know what I think about that mother Im not going to have him
joyriding over the country breaking his neck and getting into trouble
Ive seen him driving Wallace Sayres car and he drives like a fool or
a madman

It was an old dispute and a bitter one Mr Wheeler got up whistled for
the dog and went out His wife turned on Nina

I wish you wouldnt bring these things to your father Nina she said
Hes been very nervous lately and he isnt always fair to Jim

Well its time Jim was fair to Leslie Nina said with family
frankness Ill tell you something mother Jim has a girl somewhere
in town probably He takes her driving I found a glove in the car And
he must be crazy about her or hed never do what hes done

Do you know who it is

No Somebodys hes ashamed of probably or he wouldnt be so
clandestine about it

Nina

Well it looks like it Jims a man mother Hes not a little boy
Hell go through his shady period like the rest

That night it was Mrs Wheelers turn to lie awake Again and again she
went over Ninas words and her troubled mind found a basis in fact
for them Jim had been getting money from her to supplement his small
salary he had been going out a great deal at night and returning very
late once or twice in the morning he had looked ill and his eyes had
been bloodshot as though he had been drinking

Anxiety gripped her There were so many temptations for young men so
many who waited to waylay them A girl Not a good girl perhaps

She raised herself on her elbow and looked at her sleeping husband Men
were like that they begot children and then forgot them They never
looked ahead or worried They were taken up with business and always
they forgot that once they too had been young and liable to temptation

She got up some time later and tiptoed to the door of Jims room
Inside she could hear his heavy regular breathing Her boy Her only
son

She went back and crawled carefully into the bed

There was an acrimonious argument between Jim and his father the next
morning and Jim slammed out of the house leaving chaos behind him It
was then that Elizabeth learned that her father was going away He said

Maybe Im wrong mother I dont know Perhaps when I come back
Ill look around for a car I dont want him driven to doing underhand
things

Are you going away Elizabeth asked surprised

It appeared that he was More than that that he was going West with
Dick It was all arranged and nobody had told her anything about it

She was hurt and a trifle offended and she cried a little about it
Yet as Dick explained to her later that day it was simple enough Her
father needed a rest and besides it was right that he should know all
about Dicks life before he came to Haverly

Hes going to make me a present of something highly valuable you
know

But it looks as though he didnt trust you

Hes being very polite about it but of course in his eyes Im a
common thief stealing

She would not let him go on

A certain immaturity the blind confidence of youth in those it
loves explains Elizabeths docility at that time But underneath her
submission that day was a growing uneasiness fiercely suppressed
Buried deep the battle between absolute trust and fear was beginning a
battle which was so rapidly to mature her

Nina shrewd and suspicious sensed something of nervous strain in her
when she came in later that day to borrow a hat

Look here Elizabeth she began I want to talk to you Are you going
to live in thisthis hole all your life

Hole nothing Elizabeth said hotly Really Nina I do think you
might be more careful of what you say

Oh its a dear old hole Nina said negligently But hole it is
nevertheless Why in the world mother dont manage her servantsbut no
matter about that now Elizabeth theres a lot of talk about you and
Dick Livingstone and it makes me furious When I think that you can
have Wallie Sayre by lifting your finger

And that I dont intend to lift my finger Elizabeth interrupted

Then youre a fool And it is Dick Livingstone

It is Nina

Ninas ambitious soul was harrowed

That stodgy old house she said and two old people A general
housework girl and you cooking on her Thursdays out I wish you joy of
it

I wonder Elizabeth said calmly whether it ever occurs to you that
I may put love above houses and servants Or that my life is my own to
live exactly as I please Because that is what I intend to do

Nina rose angrily

Thanks she said I wish you joy of it And went out slamming the
door behind her

Then with only a day or so remaining before Dicks departure and
Jims hand already reaching for the shuttle Elizabeth found herself
the object of certain unmistakable advances from Mrs Sayre herself and
that at a rose luncheon at the house on the hill

The talk about Dick and Elizabeth had been slow in reaching the house
on the hill When it came via a little group on the terrace after the
luncheon Mrs Sayre was upset and angry and inclined to blame Wallie
Everything that he wanted had come to him all his life and he did not
know how to go after things He had sat by and let this shabbygenteel
doctor years older than the girl walk away with her

Not that she gave up entirely She knew the town and its tendency
toward overstatement And so she made a desperate attempt that
afternoon to tempt Elizabeth She took her through the greenhouses and
then through the upper floors of the house She showed her pictures
of their boat at Miami and of the house at Marblehead Elizabeth was
politely interested and completely unresponsive

When you think Mrs Sayre said at last that Wallie will have to
assume a great many burdens one of these days you can understand how
anxious I am to have him marry the right sort of girl

She thought Elizabeth flushed slightly

I am sure he will Mrs Sayre

Mrs Sayre tried a new direction

He will have all I have my dear and it is a great responsibility
Used properly money can be an agent of great good Wallies wife can be
a power if she so chooses She can look after the poor I have a long
list of pensioners but I am too old to add personal service

That would be wonderful Elizabeth said gravely For a moment she
wished Dick were rich There was so much to be done with money and
how well he would know how to do it She was thoughtful on the way
downstairs and Mrs Sayre felt some small satisfaction Now if Wallie
would only do his part

It was that night that Jim brought the tragedy on the Wheeler house that
was to lie heavy on it for many a day

There had been a little dinner one of those small informal affairs
where Mrs Wheeler having found in the market the first of the broiling
chickens and some fine green peas bought them first and then sat down
to the telephone to invite her friends Mr Oglethorpe the clergyman
and his wife accepted cheerfully Harrison Miller resignedly Then Mrs
Wheeler drew a long resolute breath and invited Mrs Sayre When that
lady accepted with alacrity Mrs Wheeler hastily revised her menu
telephoned the florist for flowers and spent a long halfhour with
Annie over plates and finger bowls

Jim was not coming home and Elizabeth was dining with Nina Mrs
Wheeler bustled about the house contentedly Everything was going well
after all Before long there would be a car and Jim would spend more
time at home Nina and Leslie were happy again And Elizabethnot a
good match perhaps but a marriage for love if ever there was one

She sat at the foot of her table that night rather too watchful of
Annie but supremely content She had herself scoured the loving cup
to the last degree of brightness and it stood full of flowers in the
center of the cloth

At Ninas was a smaller but similar group All over the village at that
time in the evening were similar groups gathered around flowers and
candles neatly served cheerful and undramatic groups with the house
doors closed and dogs waiting patiently outside in the long spring
twilight

Elizabeth was watching Nina Just so she was deciding would she some
day preside at her own board Perhaps before so very long too A little
separation letters to watch for and answer and then

The telephone rang and Leslie answered it He did not come back
instead they heard the house door close and soon after the rumble of
the car as it left the garage It stopped at the door and Leslie came
in

Im sorry he said but I guess Elizabeth will have to go home Youd
better come along Nina

What is it Is somebody sick Elizabeth gasped

Jims been in an automobile accident Steady now Elizabeth Hes hurt
but hes going to be all right

The Wheeler house when they got there was brightly lighted Annie was
crying in the hall and in the livingroom Mrs Sayre stood alone a
strange figure in a gaudy dress but with her face strong and calm

Theyve gone to the hospital in my car she said Theyll be there
now any minute and Mr Oglethorpe will telephone at once You are to
wait before starting in

They all knew what that meant It might be too late to start in Nina
was crying hysterically but Elizabeth could not cry She stood dryeyed
by the telephone listening to Mrs Sayre and Leslie but hardly hearing
them They had got Dick Livingstone and he had gone on in Mrs Sayre
was afraid it had been one of Wallies cars She had begged Wallie to
tell Jim to be careful in it It had too much speed

The telephone rang and Leslie took the receiver and pushed Elizabeth
gently aside He listened for a moment

Very well he said Then he hung up and stood still before he turned
around

It isnt very good news he said I wish I couldElizabeth

Elizabeth had crumpled up in a small heap on the floor

All through the long night that followed with the movement of feet
through the halls with her mothers door closing and the ghastly
silence that followed it with the dawn that came through the windows
the dawn that to Jim meant not a new day but a new life beyond their
living touch all through the night Elizabeth was aware of two figures
that came and went One was Dick quiet tender and watchful And one
was of a heavy woman in a gaudy dress her face old and weary in the
morning light who tended her with gentle hands

She fell asleep as the light was brightening in the East with Dick
holding her hands and kneeling on the floor beside her bed

It was not until the next day that they knew that Jim had not been
alone A girl who was with him had been pinned under the car and had
died instantly

Jim had woven his bit in the pattern and passed on The girl was
negligible she was she had been That was all But Jims death added
the last element to the impending catastrophe It sent Dick West alone




XXII

For several days after his visit to the Livingstone ranch Louis Bassett
made no move to go to the cabin He wandered around the town made
promiscuous acquaintances and led up in careful conversations with such
older residents as he could find to the Clark and Livingstone families
Of the latter he learned nothing of the former not much that he had not
known before

One day he happened on a short heavyset man the sheriff who had lost
his office on the strength of Jud Clarks escape and had now recovered
it Bassett had brought some whisky with him and on the promise of a
drink lured Wilkins to his room Over his glass the sheriff talked

All this newspaper stuff lately about Jud Clark being alive is dead
wrong he declared irritably Maggie Donaldson was crazy You can
ask the people here about her They all know it Those newspaper fellows
descended on us here with a toothbrush apiece and a suitcase full of
liquor and thought theyd get something Seemed to think wed hold out
on them unless we got our skins full But there isnt anything to hold
out Jud Clarks dead Thats all

Sure hes dead Bassett agreed amiably You found his horse didnt
you

Yes Dead And when you find a mans horse dead in the mountains in a
blizzard you dont need any more evidence It was five months before
you could see a trail up the Goat that winter

Bassett nodded rose and poured out another drink

I suppose he observed casually that even if Clark turned up now it
would be hard to convict him wouldnt it

The sheriff considered that holding up his glass

Well yes and no he said It was circumstantial evidence mostly
Nobody saw it done The worst thing against him was his running off

How about witnesses

Nobody actually saw it done John Donaldson came the nearest and hes
dead Lucass wife was still alive the last I heard and I reckon the
valet is floating around somewhere

I suppose if he did turn up youd make a try for it Bassett stared at
the end of his cigar

Wed make a try for it all right Wilkins said somberly There are
some folks in this county still giving me the laugh over that case

The next day Bassett hired a quiet horse rolled in his raincoat two
days supply of food strapped it to the cantle of his saddle and rode
into the mountains He had not ridden for years and at the end of the
first hour he began to realize that he was in for a bad time By noon
he was so sore that he could hardly get out of the saddle and so stiff
that once out he could barely get back again All morning the horse
had climbed twisting back and forth on a narrow canyon trail grunting
occasionally as is the way of a horse on a steep grade All morning
they had followed a roaring mountain stream descending in small
cataracts from the ice fields far above And all morning Bassett had
been mentally following that trail as it had been ridden ten years
ago by a boy maddened with fear and drink who drove his horse forward
through the night and the blizzard with no objective and no hope

He found it practically impossible to connect this frenzied fugitive
with the quiet man in his office chair at Haverly the man who was or
was not Judson Clark He lay on a bank at noon and faced the situation
squarely while his horse hobbled grazed with grotesque little forward
jumps in an upland meadow Either Dick Livingstone was Clark or he
was the unknown occasional visitor at the Livingstone Ranch If he
were Clark and if that could be proved there were two courses open to
Bassett He could denounce him to the authorities and then spring
the big story of his career Or he could let things stand From a
professional standpoint the first course attracted him as a man he
began to hate it The last few days had shed a new light on Judson
Clark He had been immensely popular there were men in the town who
told about trying to save him from himself He had been extravagant but
he had also been generous He had been a good kid until liberty and
money got hold of him There had been more than one man in the sheriffs
posse who hadnt wanted to find him

He was tempted to turn back The mountains surrounded him somber and
majestically still They made him feel infinitely small and rather
impertinent as though he had come to penetrate the secrets they never
yielded He had almost to fight a conviction that they were hostile

After an hour or so he determined to go on Let them throw him over a
gorge if they so determined He got up grunting and leading the horse
beside a boulder climbed painfully into the saddle To relieve his
depression he addressed the horse

It would be easier on both of us if you were two feet narrower in the
beam old dear he said

Nevertheless he made good time By six oclock he knew that he must
have made thirty odd miles and that he must be near the cabin Also
that it was going to be bitterly cold that night under the snow fields
and that he had brought no wood axe The deep valley was purple with
twilight by seven and he could scarcely see the roughdrawn trail map
he had been following And the trail grew increasingly bad For the last
mile or two the horse took its own way

It wandered on through fords and out of them under the lowgrowing
branches of scrub pine brushing his bruised legs against rocks He had
definitely decided that he had missed the cabin when the horse turned
off the trail and he saw it

It was built of rough logs the chinks once closed with mud which had
fallen away The door stood open and his entrance into its darkness was
followed by the scurrying of many little feet Bassett unstrapped his
raincoat from the saddle with fingers numb with cold and flung it to
the ground He uncinched and removed the heavy saddle hobbled his horse
and removed the bridle and turned him loose with a slap on the flank

For the love of Mike dont go far old man he besought him And was
startled by the sound of his own voice

By the light of his candle lantern the prospects were extremely poor
The fir branches in the doubleberthed bunk were dry and useless the
floor was crumbling under his feet and the roof of the leanto had
fallen in and crushed the rusty stove In the cabin itself some one had
recently placed a large flat stone in a corner for a fireplace with two
slabs to back it and above it had broken out a corner of the roof as
a chimney Bassett thought he saw the handwork of some enterprising
journalist and smiled grimly

He set to work with the resource of a man who had learned to take what
came threw the dry bedding onto the slab and set a match to it brought
in portions of the leanto roof for further supply for the fire opened
a can of tomatoes and set it on the edge of the hearth to heat and
sliced bacon into his diminutive fryingpan

It was too late for any examination that night He ate his supper from
the rough table drawing up to it a broken chair and afterwards brought
in more wood for his fire Then with a lighted cigar and with his
boots steaming on the hearth he sat in front of the blaze and fell into
deep study

He was aching in every muscle when he finally stretched out on the bare
boards of the lower bunk While he slept small furry noses appeared in
the openings in the broken floor to be followed by little bodies that
moved cautiously out into the open He roused once and peered over the
edge of the bunk Several field mice were basking in front of the dying
embers of the fire and two were sitting on his boots He grinned at
them and lay back again but he found himself fully awake and very
uncomfortable He lay there contemplating his own folly and demanding
of himself almost fiercely what he had expected to get out of all this
effort and misery For ten years or so men had come here Wilkins had
come for one and there had been others And had found nothing and had
gone away And now he was there the end of the procession to look for
God knows what

He pulled the raincoat up around his shoulders and lay back stiffly
Thenhe was not an imaginative manhe began to feel that eyes were
staring at him furtive hidden eyes intently watching him

Without moving he began to rake the cabin with his eyes wall to wall
corner to corner He turned cautiously and glanced at the door into
the leanto It gaped cavernous and empty But the sense of being
watched persisted and when he looked at the floor the field mice had
disappeared

He began gradually to see more clearly as his eyes grew accustomed to
the semidarkness and he felt too that he could almost locate the
direction of the menace For as a menace he found himself considering
it It was the broken windowless East wall opposite the bunk

After a time the thing became intolerable He reached for his revolver
and getting quickly out of the bunk ran to the doorway and threw open
the door to find himself peering into a blackness like a wall and to
hear a hasty crunching of the underbrush that sounded like some animal
in full flight

With the sounds and his own movement the terror died The cold night
air on his face the feel of the pine needles under his stockinged
feet brought him back to sense and normality Some creature of the
wilderness a deer or a bear perhaps had been moving stealthily
outside the cabin and it was sound he had heard not a gaze he had
felt He was rather cynically amused at himself He went back into the
cabin closed the door and stooped to turn his boots over before the
fire

It was while he was stooping that he heard a horse galloping off along
the trail

He did not go to sleep again Now and then he considered the possibility
of its having been his own animal somehow freed of the rope and
frightened by the same thing that had frightened him But when with the
first light he went outside his horse securely hobbled was grazing on
the scant pasture not far away

Before he cooked his breakfast he made a minute examination of the
ground beneath the East wall but the earth was hard and a broken
branch or two might have been caused by his horse He had no skill in
woodcraft and in the broad day his alarm seemed almost absurd Some
free horse on the range had probably wandered into the vicinity of the
cabin and had made off again on a trot Nevertheless he made up
his mind not to remain over another night but to look about after
breakfast and then to start down again

He worked on his boots dry and hard after yesterdays wetting fried
his bacon and dropped some crackers into the sizzling fat and ate
quickly After that he went out to the trail and inspected it He had
an idea that range horses were mostly unshod and that perhaps the trail
would reveal something But it was unused and overgrown Not until he
had gone some distance did he find anything Then in a small bare spot
he found in the dust the imprints of a horses shoes turned down the
trail up which he had come

Even then he was slow to read into the incident anything that related to
himself or to his errand He went over the various contingencies of the
trail a ranger on his way to town a forest fire somewhere a belated
hound from the newspaper pack He was convinced now that human eyes had
watched him for some time through the log wall the night before but he
could not connect them with the business in hand

He set resolutely about his business which was to turn up somehow
some way a proof of the truth of Maggie Donaldsons dying statement To
begin with then he accepted that statement to find where it would lead
him and it led him eventually to the brokendown stove under the
fallen roof of the leanto

He deliberately set himself to work at first to reconstruct the life
in the cabin Jud would have had the lower bunk David the upper The
skeleton of a cot bed in the leanto would have been Maggies But none
of them yielded anything

Very well Having accepted that they lived here it was from here that
the escape was made They would have started the moment the snow was
melted enough to let them get out and they would have taken not the
trail toward the town but some other and circuitous route toward the
railroad But there had been things to do before they left They would
have cleared the cabin of every trace of occupancy the tin cans
Clarks clothing such bedding as they could not carry The cans must
have been a problem the clothes of course could have been burned
But there were things like buttons that did not burn easily Clarks
watch if he wore one his cuff links Buried

It occurred to him that they might have disposed of some of the
unburnable articles under the floor and he lifted a rough board or two
But to pursue the search systematically he would have needed a pickaxe
and reluctantly he gave it up and turned his attention to the leanto
and the buried stove

The stove lay in a shallow pit filled with ancient ashes and crumbled
bits of wood from the roof It lay on its side its sheetiron sides
collapsed its long chimney disintegrated He was in a heavy sweat
before he had uncovered it and was able to remove it from its bed of
ashes and pine needles This done he brought his candlelantern and
settled himself crosslegged on the ground

His first casual inspection of the ashes revealed nothing He set to
work more carefully then picking them up by handfuls examining and
discarding Within ten minutes he had in a pile beside him some burned
and blackened metal buttons the eyelets and a piece of leather from a
shoe and the almost unrecognizable nib of a fountain pen

He sat with them in the palm of his hand Taken alone each one was
insignificant proved nothing whatever Taken all together they assumed
vast proportions became convincing became evidence

Late that night he descended stiffly at the livery stable and turned
his weary horse over to a stableman

Looks dead beat said the stableman eyeing the animal

Hes got nothing on me Bassett responded cheerfully Better give him
a hot bath and put him to bed Thats what Im going to do

He walked back to the hotel glad to stretch his aching muscles The
lobby was empty and behind the desk the night clerk was waiting for the
midnight train Bassett was wide awake by that time and he went back to
the desk and lounged against it

You look as though youd struck oil said the night clerk

Oil Ill tell you what I have struck Ive struck a livery stable
saddle two million times in the last two days

The clerk grinned and Bassett idly pulled the register toward him

J Smith Minneapolis he read Then he stopped and stared Richard
Livingstone was registered on the next line above

Dick had found it hard to leave Elizabeth for she clung to him in her
grief with childish wistfulness He found too that her family depended
on him rather than on Leslie Ward for moral support It was to him that
Walter Wheeler looked for assurance that the father had had no indirect
responsibility for the sons death it was to him that Jims mother
lying grayfaced and listless in her bed or on her couch brought her
anxious questionings Had Jim suffered Could they have avoided it And
an insistent demand to know who and what had been the girl who was with
him

In spite of his own feeling that he would have to go to Norada quickly
before David became impatient over his exile Dick took a few hours to
find the answer to that question But when he found it he could not
tell them The girl had been a dweller in the shady byways of life had
played her small unmoral part and gone on perhaps to some place where
men were kinder and less urgent Dick did not judge her He saw her as
her kind had been through all time storm centers of the social world
passively and unconsciously blighting at once the hunters and the prey

He secured her former address from the police a threestory brick
roominghouse in the local tenderloin and waited rather uncomfortably
for the mistress of the place to see him She came at last a big woman
vast and shapeless and with an amiable loose smile and she came in with
the light step of the overfleshed only to pause in the doorway and to
stare at him

My God she said I thought you were dead

Im afraid youre mistaking me for some one else arent you

She looked at him carefully

Id have sworn she muttered and turning to the button inside the
door she switched on the light Then she surveyed him again

Whats your name

Livingstone Doctor Livingstone I called

Is that for me or for the police

Now see here he said pleasantly I dont know who you are mistaking
me for and Im not hiding from the police Heres my card and I
have come from the family of a young man named Wheeler who was killed
recently in an automobile accident

She took the card and read it and then resumed her intent scrutiny of
him

Well you fooled me all right she said at last I thought you
werewell never mind that What about this Wheeler family Are they
going to settle with the undertaker Because I tell you flat I cant
and wont She owed me a months rent and her clothes wont bring over
seventyfive or a hundred dollars

As he left he was aware that she stood in the doorway looking after
him He drove home slowly in the car and on the way he made up a kindly
story to tell the family He could not let them know that Jim had been
seeking love in the byways of life And that night he mailed a check in
payment of the undertakers bill carefully leaving the stub empty

On the third day after Jims funeral he started for Norada An interne
from a local hospital having newly finished his service there had
agreed to take over his work for a time But Dick was faintly jealous
when he installed Doctor Reynolds in his office and turned him over to
a mystified Minnie to look after

Is he going to sleep in your bed she demanded belligerently

She was only partially mollified when she found Doctor Reynolds was to
have the spare room She did not like the way things were going she
confided to Mike Why wasnt she to let on to Mrs Crosby that Doctor
Dick had gone away Or to the old doctor Both of them away and that
little upstart in the office ready to steal their patients and hang out
his own sign the moment they got back

Unused to duplicity as he was Dick found himself floundering along an
extremely crooked path He wrote a half dozen pleasant noncommittal
letters to David and Lucy spending an inordinate time on them and
gave them to Walter Wheeler to mail at stated intervals But his chief
difficulty was with Elizabeth Perhaps he would have told her there
were times when he had to fight his desire to have her share his anxiety
as well as know the truth about him But she was already carrying the
burden of Jims tragedy and her father too was insistent that she be
kept in ignorance

Until she can have the whole thing he said with the new heaviness
which had crept into his voice

Beside that real trouble Dicks looked dim and nebulous Other things
could be set right there was always a fighting chance It was only
death that was final

Elizabeth went to the station to see him off a small slim thing in
a black frock with eyes that persistently sought his face and a
determined smile He pulled her arm through his so he might hold her
hand and when he found that she was wearing her ring he drew her even
closer with a wave of passionate possession

You are mine My little girl

I am yours For ever and ever

But they assumed a certain lightness after that each to cheer the
other As when she asserted that she was sure she would always know the
moment he stopped thinking about her and he stopped with any number of
people about and said

Thats simply terrible Suppose when we are married my mind turns on
such a mundane thing as beefsteak and onions Will you simply walk out
on me

He stood on the lowest step of the train until her figure was lost in
the darkness and the porter expostulated He was that night a little
drunk with love and he did not read the note she had thrust into his
hand at the last moment until he was safely in his berth his long
figure stretched diagonally to find the length it needed

Darling darling Dick she had written I wonder so often how you can
care for me or what I have done to deserve you And I cannot write how
I feel just as I cannot say it But Dick dear I have such a terrible
fear of losing you and you are my life now You will be careful and not
run any risks wont you And just remember this always Wherever you
are and wherever I am I am thinking of you and waiting for you

He read it three times until he knew it by heart and he slept with it
in the pocket of his pajama coat

Three days later he reached Norada and registered at the Commercial
Hotel The town itself conveyed nothing to him He found it totally
unfamiliar and for its part the town passed him by without a glance
A new field had come in twenty miles from the old one and had brought
with it a fresh influx of prospectors riggers and lease buyers The
hotel was crowded

That was his first disappointment He had been nursing the hope that
surroundings which he must once have known well would assist him in
finding himself That was the theory he knew He stood at the window of
his hotel room with its angular furniture and the Gideon Bible and for
the first time he realized the difficulty of what he had set out to do
Had he been able to take David into his confidence he would have had the
names of one or two men to go to but as things were he had nothing

The almost morbid shrinking he felt from exposing his condition was
increased rather than diminished in the new surroundings He would
of course go to the ranch at Dry River and begin his inquiries from
there but not until now had he realized what that would mean his
recognition by people he could not remember the questions he could not
answer

He knew the letter to David from beginning to end but he got it out and
read it again Who was this Bassett and what mischief was he up to Why
should he himself be got out of town quickly and the warning burned Who
was G And why wouldnt the simplest thing be to locate this Bassett
himself

The more he considered that the more obvious it seemed as a solution
provided of course he could locate the man Whether Bassett were
friendly or inimical he was convinced that he knew or was finding out
something concerning himself which David was keeping from him

He was relieved when he went down to the desk to find that his man was
registered there although the clerk reported him out of town But the
very fact that only a few hours or days separated him from a solution of
the mystery heartened him

He ate his dinner alone unnoticed and after dinner in the writing
room with its mission furniture and its traveling men copying orders
he wrote a letter to Elizabeth Into it he put some of the things that
lay too deep for speech when he was with her and because he had so much
to say and therefore wrote extremely fast a considerable portion of
it was practically illegible Then as though he could hurry the trains
East he put a special delivery stamp on it

With that off his mind and the need of exercise after the trip
insistent he took his hat and wandered out into the town The main
street was crowded moving picture theaters were summoning their evening
audiences with bright lights and colored posters and automobiles lined
the curb But here and there an Indian with braids and a Stetson hat or
a cowpuncher from a ranch in boots and spurs reminded him that after all
this was the West the horse and cattle country It was still twilight
and when he had left the main street behind him he began to have a
sense of the familiar Surely he had stood here before had seen the
courthouse on its low hill the row of frame houses in small gardens
just across the street It seemed infinitely long ago but very real
He even remembered dimly an open place at the other side of the building
where the ranchmen tied their horses To test himself he walked around
Yes it was there but no horses stood there now heads drooping bridle
reins thrown loosely over the rail Only a muddy automobile without
lights and a dog on guard beside it

He spoke to the dog and it came and sniffed at him Then it squatted in
front of him looking up into his face

Lonely old chap arent you he said Well youve got nothing on
me

He felt a little cheered as he turned back toward the hotel A few
encounters with the things of his youth and perhaps the cloud would
clear away Already the courthouse had stirred some memories And on
turning back down the hill he had another swift vision photographically
distinct but unrelated to anything that had preceded or followed it It
was like a few feet cut from a moving picture film

He was riding down that street at night on a small horse and his father
was beside him on a tall one He looked up at his father and he seemed
very large The largest man in the world And the most important

It began and stopped there and his endeavor to follow it further
resulted in its ultimately leaving him It faded became less real
until he wondered if he had not himself conjured it But that experience
taught him something Things out of the past would come or they would
not come but they could not be forced One could not will to revive
them

He stood at a window facing north that night under the impression
it was east and sent his love and an inarticulate sort of prayer to
Elizabeth for her safety and happiness in the general direction of the
Arctic Circle

Bassett had not returned in the morning and he found himself with a
day on his hands He decided to try the experiment of visiting the
Livingstone ranch or at least of viewing it from a safe distance with
the hope of a repetition of last nights experience Of all his childish
memories the ranch house next to his father was most distinct When
he had at various times tried to analyze what things he recalled he had
found that what they lacked of normal memory was connection They stood
out like the one the night before each complete in itself brief and
having no apparent relation to what had gone before or what came after

But the ranch house had been different The pictures were mostly
superimposed on it it was their background Himself standing on the
mountain looking down at it and his father pointing to it the tutor
who was afraid of horses sitting at a big table in a great woodceiled
and woodpaneled room a long gallery or porch along one side of the
building and rooms added on to the house so that one had to go along the
gallery to reach them a gunroom full of guns

When much later Dick was able calmly to review that day he found his
recollection of it confused by the events that followed but one thing
stood out as clearly as his later knowledge of the almost incredible
fact that for one entire day and for the evening of another he had
openly appeared in Norada and had not been recognized That fact was his
discovery that the Livingstone ranch house had no place in his memory
whatever

He had hired a car and a driver a driver who asserted that this was
the old Livingstone ranch house And it bore no resemblance not the
faintest to the building he remembered It did not lie where it should
have lain The mountains were too far behind it It was not the house
The fields were not the proper fields It was wrong all wrong

He went no closer than the highway because it was not necessary He
ordered the car to turn and go back and for the first and only time he
was filled with bitter resentment against David David had fooled him
He sat beside the driver his face glowering and his eyes hot and let
his indignation burn in him like a flame

Hours afterwards he had of course found excuses for David Accepted
them rather as a part of the mystery which wrapped him about But they
had no effect on the decision he made during that miserable ride back to
Norada when he determined to see the man Bassett and get the truth out
of him if he had to choke it out




XXIV

Bassett was astounded when he saw Dicks signature on the hotel
register It destroyed in one line every theory he held That Judson
Clark should return to Norada after his flight was incredible Ten years
was only ten years after all It was not a lifetime There were men in
the town who had known Clark well

Nevertheless for a time he held to his earlier conviction even fought
for it He went so far as to wonder if Clark had come back for a tardy
surrender Men had done that before this had carried a burden for
years had reached the breaking point had broken But he dismissed
that There had been no evidence of breaking in the young man in the
office chair He found himself thrown back finally on the story of the
Wasson woman and wondering if he would have to accept it after all

The reaction from his certainty in the cabin to uncertainty again made
him fretful and sleepless It was almost morning before he relaxed on
his hard hotel bed enough to sleep

He wakened late and telephoned down for breakfast His confusion had
not decreased with the night and while he got painfully out of bed and
prepared to shave and dress his thoughts were busy There was no doubt
in his mind that in spite of the growth of the town the newcomer would
be under arrest almost as soon as he made his appearance A resemblance
that could deceive Beverly Carlysles brother could deceive others and
would That he had escaped so long amazed him

By the time he had bathed he had developed a sort of philosophic
acceptance of the new situation There would be no exclusive story now
no scoop The events of the next few hours were for every man to read
He shrugged his shoulders as partially dressed he carried his shaving
materials into the better light of his bedroom

With his face partially lathered he heard a knock at the door and sang
out a not uncheerful Come in It happened then that it was in
his mirror that he learned that his visitor was not the waiter but
Livingstone himself He had an instant of stunned amazement before he
turned

I beg your pardon Dick said I was afraid youd get out before I
saw you My names Livingstone and I want to talk to you if you dont
mind If you like Ill come back later

Bassett perceived two things simultaneously that owing probably to the
lather on his face he had not been recognized and that the face of the
man inside the door was haggard and strained

Thats all right Come in and sit down Ill get this stuff off my face
and be with you in a jiffy

But he was very deliberate in the bathroom His astonishment grew
rather than decreased Clearly Livingstone had not known him How then
had he known that he was in Norada And when he recognized him as he
would in a moment what then He put on his collar and tied his tie
slowly Gregory might be the key Gregory might have found out that he
had started for Norada and warned him Then if that were true this man
was Clark after all But if he were Clark he wouldnt be there It was
like a kitten after its tail It whirled in a circle and got nowhere

The waiter had laid his breakfast and gone when he emerged from the
bathroom and Dick was standing by the window looking out He turned

Im here Mr Bassett on rather a peculiar He stopped and looked at
Bassett I see You were in my office about a month ago werent you

For a headache yes Bassett was very wary and watchful but there was
no particular unfriendliness in his visitors eyes

It never occurred to me that you might be Bassett Dick said gravely
Never mind about that Eat your breakfast Do you mind if I talk while
you do it

Will you have some coffee I can get a glass from the bathroom It
takes a week to get a waiter here

Thanks Yes

The feeling of unreality grew in the reporters mind It increased still
further when they sat opposite each other the small table with its
Bible on the lower shelf between them while he made a pretense at
breakfasting

First of all Dick said at last I was not sure I had found the
right man You are the only Bassett in the place however and youre
registered from my town So I took a chance I suppose that headache was
not genuine

Bassett hesitated

No he said at last

What you really wanted to do was to see me then

In a way yes

Ill ask you one more question It may clear the air Does this mean
anything to you Ill tell you now that it doesnt to me

From his pocketbook he took the note addressed to David and passed it
over the table Bassett looked at him quickly and took it

Before you read it Ill explain something It was not sent to me It
was sent to myto Doctor David Livingstone It happened to fall into my
hands Ive come a long way to find out what it means

He paused and looked the reporter straight in the eyes I am laying my
cards on the table Bassett This G whoever he is is clearly warning
my uncle against you I want to know what he is warning him about

Bassett read the note carefully and looked up

I suppose you know who G is

I do not Do you

Ill give you another name and maybe youll get it A name that I
think will mean something to you Beverly Carlysle

The actress

Bassett had an extraordinary feeling of unreality followed by one of
doubt Either the fellow was a very good actor or

Sorry Dick said slowly I dont seem to get it I dont know that
G is as important as his warning That notes a warning

Yes Its a warning And I dont think you need me to tell you what
about

Concerning my uncle or myself

Are you trying to put it over on me that you dont know

Thats what Im trying to do Dick said with a sort of grave
patience

The reporter liked courage when he saw it and he was compelled to a
sort of reluctant admiration

Youve got your courage with you he observed How long do you
suppose it will be after you set foot on the streets of this town before
youre arrested How do you know I wont send for the police myself

I know damned well you wont Dick said grimly Not before Im
through with you Youve chosen to interest yourself in me I suppose
you dont deny the imputation in that letter Youll grant that I have
a right to know who and what you are and just what you are interested
in

Righto the reporter said cheerfully glad to get to grips and
to stop a fencing that was getting nowhere Im connected with the
TimesRepublican in your own fair city I was in the theater the night
Gregory recognized you Verbum sap

This Gregory is the G

Oh quit it Clark Bassett said suddenly impatient That letters
the last proof I needed Gregory wrote it after hed seen David
Livingstone He wouldnt have written it if he and the old man hadnt
come to an understanding Ive been to the cabin My God man Ive even
got the parts of your clothing that wouldnt burn You can thank Maggie
Donaldson for that

Donaldson Dick repeated That was it I couldnt remember her name
The woman in the cabin Maggie And Jack Jack Donaldson

He got up and was apparently dizzy for he caught at the table

Look here Bassett said let me give you a drink You look all in

But Dick shook his head

No thanks just the same Ill ask you to be plain with me Bassett I
amI have become engaged to a girl andwell I want the story Thats
all

And when Bassett only continued to stare at him

I suppose Ive begun wrong end first I forgot about how it must seem
to you I dropped a block out of my life about ten years ago Cant
remember it Im not proud of it but its the fact What Im trying to
do now is to fill in the gap But Ive got to somehow I owe it to the
girl

When Bassett could apparently find nothing to say he went on

You say I may be arrested if I go out on the street And you rather
more than intimate that a woman named Beverly Carlysle is mixed up in it
somehow I take it that I knew her

Yes You knew her Bassett said slowly At the intimation in his tone
Dick surveyed him for a moment without speaking His face pale before
took on a grayish tinge

I wasntmarried to her

No You didnt marry her See here Clark this is straight goods is
it Youre not trying to put something over on me Because if you are
you neednt Id about made up my mind to follow the story through for
my own satisfaction and then quit cold on it When a mans pulled
himself out of the mud as you have its not my business to pull him
down But I dont want you to pull any bunk

Dick winced

Out of the mud he said No Im telling you the truth Bassett I
have some fragmentary memories places and people but no names and
all of them I imagine from my childhood I pick up at a cabin in the
mountains with snow around and David Livingstone feeding me soup with
a tin spoon He tried to smile and failed His face twitched I could
stand it for myself he said but Ive tied another life to mine like
a cursed fool and now you speak of a woman and of arrest Arrest For
what

Suppose Bassett said after a moment suppose you let that go just
now and tell me more about thisthis gap Youre a medical man Youve
probably gone into your own case pretty thoroughly Im accepting your
statement you see As a matter of fact it must be true or you wouldnt
be here But Ive got to know what Im doing before I lay my cards
on the table Make it simple if you can I dont know your medical
jargon

Dick did his best The mind closed down now and then mainly from a
shock No there was no injury required He didnt think he had had an
injury A mental shock would do it if it were strong enough And fear
It was generally fear He had never considered himself braver than the
other fellow but no man liked to think that he had a cowardly mind
Even if things hadnt broken as they had hed have come back before
he went to the length of marriage to find out what it was he had been
afraid of He paused then to give Bassett a chance to tell him but the
reporter only said Go on you put your cards on the table and then
Ill lay mine out

Dick went on He didnt blame Bassett If there was something that was
in his line of work he understood At the same time he wanted to save
David anything unpleasant The word unpleasant startled Bassett by
its very inadequacy He knew now that David had built up for him an
identity that probably did not exist but he wanted Bassett to know that
there could never be doubt of Davids high purpose and his essential
fineness

Whatever I was before he finished simply and Ill get that from you
now if I am any sort of a man at all it is his work

He stood up and braced himself It had been clear to Bassett for ten
minutes that Dick was talking against time against the period of
revelation He would have it but he was mentally bracing himself
against it

I think he said Ill have that whisky now

Bassett poured him a small drink and took a turn about the room while
he drank it He was perplexed and apprehensive Strange as the story
was he was convinced that he had heard the truth He had now and then
run across men who came back after a brief disappearance with a cock
and bull story of forgetting who they were and because nearly always
these men vanished at the peak of some crisis they had always been open
to suspicion Perhaps poor devils they had been telling the truth
after all So the mind shut down eh Closed like a grave over the
unbearable

His own part in the threatening catastrophe began to obsess him Without
the warning from Gregory there would have been no return to Norada no
arrest It had all been dead and buried until he himself had revived
it And a girl too The girl in the blue dress at the theater of
course

Dick put down the glass

Im ready if you are

Does the name of Clark recall anything to you

Nothing

Judson Clark Jud Clark

Dick passed his hand over his forehead wearily

Im not sure he said It sounds familiar and then it doesnt It
doesnt mean anything to me if you get that If its a key it doesnt
unlock Thats all Am I Judson Clark

Oddly enough Bassett found himself now seeking for hope of escape in
the very situation that had previously irritated him in the story he
had heard at Wassons He considered and said almost violently

Look here I may have made a mistake I came out here pretty well
convinced Id found the solution to an old mystery and for that matter
I think I have But theres a twist in it that isnt clear and until
it is clear Im not going to saddle you with an identity that may not
belong to you You are one of two men One of them is Judson Clark and
Ill be honest with you Im pretty sure youre Clark The other I dont
know but I have reason to believe that he spent part of his time with
Henry Livingstone at Dry River

I went to the Livingstone ranch yesterday I remember my early home
That wasnt it Which one of these two men will be arrested if he is
recognized

Clark

For what

Im coming to that I suppose youll have to know Another drink No
All right About ten years ago or a little less a young chap called
Judson Clark got into trouble here and headed into the mountains in a
blizzard He was supposed to have frozen to death But recently a woman
named Donaldson made a confession on her deathbed She said that she had
helped to nurse Clark in a mountain cabin and that with the aid of some
one unnamed he had got away

Then Im Clark I remember her and the cabin

There was a short silence following that admission To Dick it was
filled with the thought of Elizabeth and of her relation to what he was
about to hear Again he braced himself for what was coming

I suppose he said at last that if I ran away I was in pretty
serious trouble What was it

Weve got no absolute proof that you are Clark remember You dont
know and Maggie Donaldson was considered not quite sane before she
died Ive told you theres a chance you are the other man

All right What had Clark done

He had shot a man

The reporter was instantly alarmed If Dick had been haggard before he
was ghastly now He got up slowly and held to the back of his chair

Notmurder he asked with stiff lips

No Bassett said quickly Not at all See here youve had about all
you can stand Remember we dont even know you are Clark All I said
was

I understand that It was murder wasnt it

Well there had been a quarrel I understand The law allows for that
I think

Dick went slowly to the window and stood with his back to Bassett For
a long time the room was quiet In the street below long lines of cars
in front of the hotel denoted the luncheon hour An Indian woman with a
child in the shawl on her back stopped in the street looked up at Dick
and extended a beaded belt With it still extended she continued to
stare at his white face

The man died of course he asked at last without turning

Yes I knew him He wasnt any great loss It was at the Clark ranch
I dont believe a conviction would be possible although they would try
for one It was circumstantial evidence

And I ran away

Clark ran away Bassett corrected him As Ive told you the
authorities here believe he is dead

After an even longer silence Dick turned

I told you there was a girl Id like to think out some way to keep
the thing from her before I surrender myself If I can protect her and
David

I tell you you dont even know you are Clark

All right If Im not theyll know If I amI tell you Im not going
through the rest of my life with a thing like that hanging over me
Maggie Donaldson was sane enough Why when I look back I know our
leaving the cabin was a flight Im not Henry Livingstones son because
he never had a son I can tell you what the Clark ranch house looks
like And after a pause Can you imagine the reverse of a dream when
youve dreamed you are guilty of something and wake up to find you are
innocent Who was the man

Bassett watched him narrowly

His name was Lucas Howard Lucas

All right Now we have that where does Beverly Carlysle come in

Clark was infatuated with her The man he shot was the man she had
married




XXV

Shortly after that Dick said he would go to his room He was still pale
but his eyes looked bright and feverish and Bassett went with him
uneasily conscious that something was not quite right Dick spoke only
once on the way

My head aches like the mischief he said and his voice was dull and
lifeless

He did not want Bassett to go with him but Bassett went nevertheless
Dicks statement that he meant to surrender himself had filled him
with uneasiness He determined following him along the hall to keep a
close guard on him for the next few hours but beyond that just then
he did not try to go If it were humanly possible he meant to smuggle
him out of the town and take him East But he had an uneasy conviction
that Dick was going to be ill The mind did strange things with the
body

Dick sat down on the edge of the bed

My head aches like the mischief he repeated Look in that grip and
find me some tablets will you Im dizzy

He made an effort and stretched out on the bed Good Lord he
muttered I havent had such a headache since

His voice trailed off Bassett bending over the army kit bag in the
corner straightened and looked around Dick was suddenly asleep and
breathing heavily

For a long time the reporter sat by the side of the bed watching him
and trying to plan some course of action He was overcome by his own
responsibility and by the prospect of tragedy that threatened That
Livingstone was Clark and that he would insist on surrendering himself
when he wakened he could no longer doubt His mind wandered back to
that day when he had visited the old house as a patient and from that
along the strange road they had both come since then He reflected not
exactly in those terms that life any mans life was only one thread
in a pattern woven of an infinite number of threads and that to tangle
the one thread was to interfere with all the others David Livingstone
the girl in the blue dress the man twitching uneasily on the bed
Wilkins the sheriff himself who could tell how many others all
threads

He swore in a whisper

The maid tapped at the door He opened it an inch or so and sent her
off In view of his new determination even the maid had become a danger
She was the same elderly woman who looked after his own bedroom and
she might have known Clark Just what Providence had kept him from
recognition before this he did not know but it could not go on
indefinitely

After an hour or so Bassett locked the door behind him and went down to
lunch He was not hungry but he wanted to get out of the room to think
without that quiet figure before him Over the pretence of food he faced
the situation Lying ready to his hand was the biggest story of his
career but he could not carry it through It was characteristic of
him that before abandoning it he should follow through to the end the
result of its publication He did not believe for instance that
either Dicks voluntary surrender or his own disclosure of the situation
necessarily meant a conviction for murder To convict a man of a crime
he did not know he had committed would be difficult But with his
customary thoroughness he followed that through also Livingstone
acquitted was once again Clark would be known to the world as Clark
The new place he had so painfully made for himself would be gone The
story would follow him never to be lived down And in his particular
profession confidence and respect were half the game All that would be
gone

Thus by gradual stages he got back to David and he struggled for the
motive which lay behind every decisive human act A man who followed a
course by which he had nothing to gain and everything to lose was either
a fool or was actuated by some profound unselfishness To save a life
But with all the resources Clark could have commanded added to his
personal popularity a first degree sentence would have been unlikely
Not a life then but perhaps something greater than a life A mans
soul

It came to him then in a great light of comprehension the thing David
had tried to do to take this waster and fugitive the slate of his mind
wiped clean by shock and illness only his childish memories remaining
and on it to lead him to write a new record To take the body he had
found and the always untouched soul and from them to make a man

And with that comprehension came the conviction too that David had
succeeded He had indeed made a man

He ate absently consulting his railroad schedule and formulating the
arguments he meant to use against Dicks determination to give himself
up He foresaw a struggle there but he himself held one or two strong
cardsthe ruthless undoing of Davids work the involving of David for
conspiring against the law And Dicks own obligation to the girl at
home

He was more at ease in the practical arrangements An express went
through on the main line at midnight and there was a local on the
branch line at eight But the local train the railway station too
were full of possible dangers After some thought he decided to get a
car drive down to the main line with Dick and then send the car back

He went out at once and made an arrangement for a car and on returning
notified the clerk that he was going to leave and asked to have his
bill made out After some hesitation he said Ill pay threetwenty
too while Im at it Friend of mine there going with me Yes up to
tonight

As he turned away he saw the short heavy figure of Wilkins coming in
He stood back and watched The sheriff went to the desk pulled the
register toward him and ran over several pages of it Then he shoved it
away turned and saw him

Been away havent you he asked

Yes I took a little horseback trip into the mountains My knees are
still not on speaking terms

The sheriff chuckled Then he sobered

Come and sit down he said Im going to watch who goes in and out of
here for a while

Bassett followed him unwillingly to two chairs that faced the desk and
the lobby He had the key of Dicks room in his pocket but he knew that
if he wakened he could easily telephone and have his door unlocked
But that was not his only anxiety He had a sudden conviction that
the sheriffs watch was connected with Dick himself Wilkins from a
friendly and gregarious fellowbeing had suddenly grown to sinister
proportions in his mind

And as the minutes went by with the sheriff sitting forward and
watching the lobby and staircase with intent unblinking eyes Bassetts
anxiety turned to fear He found his heart leaping when the room
bells rang and the clerk with a glance at the annunciator sent boys
hurrying off His hands shook and he felt them cold and moist And all
the time Wilkins was holding him with a flow of unimportant chatter

Watching for any one in particular he managed after five minutes or
so

Yes Ill tell you about it as soon asBill Is Alex outside

Bill stopped in front of them and nodded

All right Now get thisI want everything decent and in order No
excitement Ill come out behind him and you and Bill stand by Outside
Ill speak to him and when we walk off just fall in behind But keep
close

Bill wandered off to take up a stand of extreme nonchalance inside the
entrance When Wilkins turned to him again Bassett had had a moment to
adjust himself and more or less to plan his own campaign

Somebodys out of luck he commented And speaking of being out of
luck Ive got a sick man on my hands Friend of mine from home Weve
got to catch the midnight too

Too bad Wilkins commented rather absently Then perhaps feeling that
he had not shown proper interest Tell you what Ill do Ive got some
business on hand now but itll be cleared up one way or another pretty
soon Ill bring my car around and take him to the station These hacks
are the limit to ride in

The disaster to his plans thus threatened steadied the reporter and he
managed to keep his face impassive

Thanks he said Ill let you know if hes able to travel Is
thisis this business youre on confidential

Well it is and it isnt Ive talked some to you and as youre
leaving anyhowits the Jud Clark case again

Sort of hysteria I suppose Hell be seen all over the country for the
next six months

Yes But I never saw a hysterical Indian Well a little while ago an
Indian woman named Lizzie Lazarus blew into my office Shes a smart
woman Her husband was a breed dairy hand on the Clark ranch for years
Lizzie was the first Indian woman in these parts to go to school and
besides being smart shes got Indian sight You know these Indians
When they arent blind with trachoma they can see further and better
than a telescope

Bassett made an effort

Whats that got to do with Jud Clark he asked

Well she blew in You know there was a reward out for him and I guess
it still stands Ill have to look it up for if Maggie Donaldson wasnt
crazy some one will turn him up some day probably Well Lizzie blew
in and she said shed seen Jud Clark Saw him standing at a second
story window of this hotel Can you beat that

Not for pure invention Hardly

Thats what I said at first But I dont know In some ways it would
be like him He wouldnt mind coming back and giving us the laugh if
he thought he could get away with it He didnt know fear Only time he
ever showed funk was when he beat it after the shooting and then he was
full of hootch and on the edge of DTs

A man doesnt play jokes with the hangmans rope Bassett commented
dryly He looked at his watch and rose Its a good story but I
wouldnt wear out any trouserseats sitting here watching for him If
hes living hes taken pretty good care for ten years not to put his
head in the noose and Id remember this too Wherever he is if he is
anywhere hes probably so changed his appearance that Telescope Lizzie
wouldnt know him Or you either

Probably the sheriff said comfortably Still Im not taking any
chances Im up for reelection this fall and that Donaldson womans
story nearly queered me Ive got a fellow at the railroad station just
for luck

Bassett went up the stairs and along the corridor deep in dejected
thought The trap of his own making was closing and his active mind was
busy with schemes for getting Dick away before it shut entirely

It might be better in one way to keep Livingstone there in his room
until the alarm blew over On the other hand Livingstone himself had
to be dealt with and that he would remain quiescent under the
circumstances was unlikely The motor to the main line seemed to be the
best thing True he would have first to get Livingstone to agree to go
That done and he did not underestimate its difficulty there was the
question of getting him out of the hotel now that the alarm had been
given

When he found Dick still sleeping he made a careful survey of the second
floor There was a second staircase but investigation showed that it
led into the kitchens He decided finally on a fireescape from a rear
hall window which led into a courtyard littered with the untidy rubbish
of an overcrowded and undermanned hotel and where now two or three
saddled horses waited while their riders ate within

When he had made certain that he was not observed he unlocked and opened
the window and removed the wire screen There was a red fireexit lamp
in the ceiling nearby but he could not reach it nor could he find any
wall switch Nevertheless he knew by that time that through the window
lay Dicks only chance of escape He cleared the grating of a broken box
and an empty flower pot stood the screen outside the wall and then
still unobserved made his way back to his own bedroom and packed his
belongings

Dick was still sleeping stretched on his bed when he returned to
threetwenty And here Bassetts careful plans began to go awry for
Dicks body was twitching and his face was pale and covered with a cold
sweat From wondering how they could get away Bassett began to wonder
whether they would get away at all The sleep was more like a stupor
than sleep He sat down by the bed closer to sheer fright than he had
ever been before and wretched with the miserable knowledge of his own
responsibility

As the afternoon wore on it became increasingly evident that somehow or
other he must get a doctor He turned the subject over in his mind pro
and con If he could get a new man one who did not remember Jud Clark
it might do But he hesitated until at seven Dick opened his eyes and
clearly did not know him Then he knew that the matter was out of his
hands and that from now on whatever it was that controlled the affairs
of men Davids God or his own vague Providence was in charge

He got his hat and went out and down the stairs again Wilkins had
disappeared but Bill still stood by the entrance watching the crowd
that drifted in and out In his state of tension he felt that the hotel
clerks eyes were suspicious as he retained the two rooms for another
day and that Bill watched him out with more than casual interest
Even the matter of cancelling the order for the car loomed large and
suspicionbreeding before him but he accomplished it and then set out
to find medical assistance

There however chance favored him The first doctors sign led him to a
young man new to the town and obviously at leisure Not that he found
that out at once He invented a condition for himself as he had done
once before got a prescription and paid for it learned what he wanted
and then mentioned Dick He was careful to emphasize his name and
profession and his standing back home

Ill admit hes got me worried he finished He saw me registered and
came to my room this morning to see me and got sick there That is he
said he had a violent headache and was dizzy I got him to his room and
on the bed and hes been sleeping ever since He looks pretty sick to
me

He was conscious of Bills eyes on him as they went through the lobby
again but he realized now that they were unsuspicious Bassett himself
was in a hot sweat He stopped outside the room and mopped his face

Look kind of shot up yourself the doctor commented Watch this sun
out here Because its dry here you Eastern people dont notice the heat
until it plays the deuce with you

He made a careful examination of the sleeping man while Bassett watched
his face

Been a drinking man Or do you know

No But I think not I gave him a small drink this morning when he
seemed to need it

Been like this all day

Since noon Yes

Once more the medical man stooped When he straightened it was to
deliver Bassett a body blow

I dont like his condition or that twitching If these were the good
old days in Wyoming Id say he is on the verge of delirium tremens
But thats only snap judgment He might be on the verge of a good many
things Anyhow hed better be moved to the hospital This is no place
for him

And against this commonsense suggestion Bassett had nothing to offer
If the doctor had been looking he would have seen him make a gesture of
despair

I suppose so he said dully Is it near Ill go myself and get a
room

Thats my advice Ill look in later and if the stupor continues Ill
have in a consultant He picked up his bag and stood looking down at
the bed Big finelooking chap isnt he he commented Married

No

Well well get the ambulance and later on well go over him properly
Id call a maid to sit with him if I were you In the grip of a
situation that was too much for him Bassett rang the bell It was
answered by the elderly maid who took care of his own bedroom

Months later puzzling over the situation Bassett was to wonder and
not to know whether chance or design brought the Thorwald woman to
the door that night At the time and for weeks he laid it to tragic
chance the same chance which had placed in Dicks hand the warning
letter that had brought him West But as months went on the part played
in the tragedy by that faded woman with her tired dispirited voice and
her ash colored hair streaked with gray assumed other proportions
loomed large and mysterious

There were times when he wished that some prescience of danger had
made him throttle her then and there so she could not have raised her
shrill alarming voice But he had no warning All he saw was a woman
in a washedout blue calico dress and a fresh white apron raising
incurious eyes to his

I suppose its all right if she sits in the hall Bassett inquired
still fighting his losing fight She can go in if he stirs

Righto said the doctor who had been to France and had brought home
some British phrases

Bassett walked back from the hospital alone The game was up and he knew
it Sooner or laterIn a way he tried to defend himself to himself
He had done his best Two or three days ago he would have been exultant
over the developments After all mince things as one would Clark was a
murderer Other men killed and paid the penalty And the game was not up
entirely at that The providence which had watched over him for so long
might continue to The hospital was new It was ironically enough the
Clark Memorial hospital There was still a chance

He was conscious of something strange as he entered the lobby The
constable was gone and there was no clerk behind the desk At the foot
of the stairs stood a group of guests and loungers looking up while a
bellboy barred the way

Even then Bassetts first thought was of fire He elbowed his way to
the foot of the stairs and demanded to be allowed to go up but he was
refused

In a few minutes said the boy No need of excitement

Is it a fire

I dont know myself Ive got my orders Thats all Wilkins came
hurrying in The crowd silent and respectful before the law opened to
let him through and closed behind him

Bassett stood at the foot of the stairs looking up




XXVI

To Elizabeth the first days of Dicks absence were unbelievably dreary
She seemed to live only from one visit of the postman to the next She
felt sometimes that only part of her was at home in the Wheeler house
slept at night in her white bed donned its black frocks and took them
off and made those sad daily pilgrimages to the cemetery above the
town where her mother tidied with tender hands the long narrow mound
so fearfully remindful of Jims tall slim body

That part of her grieved sorely and spent itself in small comforting
actions and little caressing touches on bowed heads and griefstooped
shoulders It put away Jims clothing and kept immaculate the room
where now her mother spent most of her waking hours It sent her on
her knees at night to pray for Jims happiness in some youngman heaven
which would please him But the other part of her was not there at all
It was off with Dick in some mysterious place of mountains and vast
distance called Wyoming

And because of this division in herself because she felt that her
loyalty to her people had wavered because she knew that already she had
forsaken her father and her mother and would follow her love through the
rest of her life she was touchingly anxious to comfort and to please
them

Shes taking Dicks absence very hard Mrs Wheeler said one night
when she had kissed them and gone upstairs to bed She worries me
sometimes

Mr Wheeler sighed Why was it that a man could not tell his children
what he had learnedthat nothing was so great as one expected that
love was worth living for but not dying for The impatience of youth
for life It had killed Jim It was hurting Nina It would all come
all come in Gods good time The young did not live today but always
tomorrow There seemed no time to live today for any one First one
looked ahead and said I will be so happy And before one knew it one
was looking back and saying I was so happy

Shell be all right he said aloud

He got up and whistled for the dog

Ill take him around the block before I lock up he said heavily He
bent over and kissed his wife She was a sad figure to him in her black
dress He did not say to her what he thought sometimes that Jim had
been saved a great deal That to live on and to lose the things one
loved one by one was harder than to go quickly from a joyous youth

He had not told her what he knew about Jims companion that night She
would never have understood In her simple and childlike faith she
knew that her boy sat that day among the blessed company of heaven He
himself believed that Jim had gone forgiven into whatever lay behind the
veil we call death had gone shriven and clean before the Judge who knew
the urge of youth and life He did not fear for Jim He only missed him

He walked around the block that night a stooped commonplace figure the
dog at his heels Now and then he spoke to him for companionship
At the corner he stopped and looked along the side street toward the
Livingstone house And as he looked he sighed Jim and Nina and now
Elizabeth Jim and Nina were beyond his care now He could do no more
But what could he do for Elizabeth That too wasnt that beyond him
He stood still facing the tragedy of his helplessness beset by vague
apprehensions Then he went on doggedly his hands clasped behind him
his head sunk on his breast

He lay awake for a long time that night wondering whether he and Dick
had been quite fair to Elizabeth She should he thought have been
told Then if Dicks apprehensions were justified she would have had
some preparation As it wasSuppose something turned up out there
something that would break her heart

He had thought Margaret was sleeping but after a time she moved and
slipped her hand into his It comforted him That too was life Very
soon now they would be alone together again as in the early days before
the children came All the years and the struggle and then back where
they started But still thank God hand in hand

Ever since the night of Jims death Mrs Sayre had been a constant
visitor to the house She came in solid practical and with an
everyday manner neither forcedly cheerful nor too decorously mournful
which made her very welcome After the three first days when she
had practically lived at the house there was no necessity for small
pretensions with her She knew the china closet and the pantry and the
kitchen She had even penetrated to Mr Wheelers shabby old den on
the second floor and had slept a part of the first night there on the
leather couch with broken springs which he kept because it fitted his
body

She was a kindly woman and she had ached with pity And because of her
usual detachment from the town and its affairs the feeling that she
was being of service gave her a little glow of content She liked the
family too and particularly she liked Elizabeth But after she had
seen Dick and Elizabeth together once or twice she felt that no plan she
might make for Wallace could possibly succeed Lying on the old leather
couch that first night between her frequent excursions among the waking
family she had thought that out and abandoned it

But during the days that followed the funeral she was increasingly
anxious about Wallace She knew that rumors of the engagement had
reached him for he was restless and irritable He did not care to go
out but wandered about the house or until late at night sat smoking
alone on the terrace looking down at the town with sunken unhappy
eyes Once or twice in the evening he had taken his car and started out
and lying awake in her French bed she would hear him coming hours later
In the mornings his eyes were suffused and his color bad and she knew
that he was drinking in order to get to sleep

On the third day after Dicks departure for the West she got up when
she heard him coming in and putting on her dressing gown and slippers
knocked at his door

Come in he called ungraciously

She found him with his coat off standing half defiantly with a glass of
whisky and soda in his hand She went up to him and took it from him

Weve had enough of that in the family Wallie she said And its a
pretty poor resource in time of trouble

Ill have that back if you dont mind

Nonsense she said briskly and flung it glass and all out of the
window She was rather impressive when she turned

Ive been a fairly indulgent mother she said Ive let you alone
because its a Sayre trait to run away when they feel a pull on the bit
But theres a limit to my patience and it is reached when my son drinks
to forget a girl

He flushed and glowered at her in somber silence but she moved about
the room calmly giving it a housekeepers critical inspection and
apparently unconscious of his anger

I dont believe you ever cared for any one in all your life he said
roughly If you had you would know

She was straightening a picture over the mantel and she completed her
work before she turned

I care for you

Thats different

Very well then I cared for your father I cared terribly And he
killed my love

She padded out of the room her heavy square body in its blazing kimono
a trifle rigid but her face still and calm He remained staring at
the door when she had closed it and for some time after He knew what
message for him had lain behind that emotionless speech of hers not
only understanding but a warning She had cared terribly and his
father had killed that love He had drunk and played through his gay
young life and then he had died and no one had greatly mourned him

She had left the decanter on its stand and he made a movement toward
it Then with a half smile he picked it up and walked to the window
with it He was still smiling half boyishly as he put out his light
and got into bed It had occurred to him that the milkmans flivver
driving in at the break of dawn would encounter considerable glass

By morning after a bad night he had made a sort of doubleheaded
resolution that he was through with booze as he termed it and that
he would find out how he stood with Elizabeth But for a day or two no
opportunity presented itself When he called there was always present
some gravefaced sympathizing visitor dark clad and low of voice and
over the drawingroom would hang the indescribable hush of a house
in mourning It seemed to touch Elizabeth too making her remote and
beyond earthly things He would go in burning with impatience hungry
for the mere sight of her fairly overcharged with emotion only to face
that strange new spirituality that made him ashamed of the fleshly urge
in him

Once he found Clare Rossiter there and was aware of something electric
in the air After a time he identified it Behind the Rossiter girls
soft voice and sympathetic words there was a veiled hostility She
was watching Elizabeth was overconscious of her And she was for some
reason playing up to himself He thought he saw a faint look of relief
on Elizabeths face when Clare at last rose to go

Im on my way to see the man Dick Livingstone left in his place
Clare said adjusting her veil at the mirror Ive got a cold Isnt it
queer the way the whole Livingstone connection is broken up

Hardly queer And its only temporary

Possibly But if you ask me I dont believe Dick will come back Mind
I dont defend the town but it doesnt like to be fooled And hes
fooled it for years I know a lot of people whod quit going to him
She turned to Wallie

He isnt Davids nephew you know The question is who is he Of
course I dont say it but a good many are saying that when a man takes
a false identity he has something to hide

She gave them no chance to reply but sauntered out with her
sexconscious halfsensuous walk Outside the door her smile faded
and her face was hard and bitter She might forget Dick Livingstone
but never would she forgive herself for her confession to Elizabeth nor
Elizabeth for having heard it

Wallie turned to Elizabeth when she had gone slightly bewildered

Whats got into her he inquired And then seeing Elizabeths white
face rather shrewdly That was one for him and two for you was it

I dont know Probably

I wonder if you would look like that if any one attacked me

No one attacks you Wallie

Thats not an answer You wouldnt would you Its different isnt
it

Yes A little

He straightened and looked past her unseeing at the wall I guess
Ive known it for quite a while he said at last I didnt want to
believe it so I wouldnt Are you engaged to him

Yes Its not to be known just yet Wallie

Hes a good fellow he said after rather a long silence Not that
that makes it easier he added with a twisted smile Then boyishly and
unexpectedly he said Oh my God

He sat down and when the dog came and placed a head on his knee he
patted it absently He wanted to go but he had a queer feeling that
when he went he went for good

Ive cared for you for years he said Ive been a poor lot but Id
have been a good bit worse except for you

And again

Only last night I made up my mind that if youd have me Id make
something out of myself I suppose a mans pretty weak when he puts a
responsibility like that on a girl

She yearned over him rather She made little tentative overtures of
friendship and affection But he scarcely seemed to hear them wrapped
as he was in the selfish absorption of his disappointment When she
heard the postman outside and went to the door for the mail she thought
he had not noticed her going But when she returned he was watching her
with jealous almost tragic eyes

I suppose you hear from him by every mail

There has been nothing today

Something in her voice or her face made him look at her closely

Has he written at all

The first day he got there Not since

He went away soon and not after all with the feeling of going for
good In his sceptical young mind fed by Clares malice was growing a
comforting doubt of Dicks good faith




XXVII

When Wilkins had disappeared around the angle of the staircase
Bassett went to a chair and sat down He felt sick and his knees were
trembling Something had happened a search for Clark room by room
perhaps and the discovery had been made

He was totally unable to think or to plan With Dick well they could
perhaps have made a run for it The fireescape stood ready But as
things wereThe murmuring among the crowd at the foot of the stairs
ceased and he looked up Wilkins was on the staircase searching
the lobby with his eyes When he saw Bassett he came quickly down and
confronted him his face angry and suspicious

Youre mixed up in this somehow he said sharply You might as well
come over with the story Well get him He cant get out of this town

With the words and the knowledge that in some incredible fashion Dick
had made his escape Bassetts mind reacted instantly

Whats eating you Wilkins he demanded Who got away I couldnt get
that tonguetied bellhop to tell me Thought it was a fire

Dont stall Bassett Youve had Jud Clark hidden upstairs in
threetwenty all day

Bassett got up and towered angrily over the sheriff The crowd had
turned and was watching

In threetwenty he said Youre crazy Jud Clark Let me tell you
something I dont know what youve got in your head but threetwenty
is a Doctor Livingstone from near my home town Well known and highly
respected too Whats more hes a sick man and if hes got away as
you say its because he is delirious I had a doctor in to see him an
hour ago Ive just arranged for a room at the hospital for him Does
that look as though Ive been hiding him

The positiveness of his identification and his indignation resulted in a
change in Wilkins manner

Ill ask you to stay here until I come back His tone was official
but less suspicious Well have him in a half hour Its Clark all
right Im not saying you knew it was Clark but I want to ask you some
questions

He went out and Bassett heard him shouting an order in the street He
went to the street door and realized that a search was going on both
by the police and by unofficial volunteers Men on horseback clattered
by to guard the borders of the town and in the vicinity of the hotel
searchers were investigating yards and alleyways

Bassett himself was helpless He stood by watching the fire of his own
igniting conscious of the curious scrutiny of the few hotel loungers
who remained and expecting momentarily to hear of Dicks capture It
must come eventually he felt sure As to how Dick had been identified
or by what means he had escaped he was in complete ignorance and an
endeavor to learn by establishing the former entente cordiale between
the room clerk and himself was met by a suspicious glance and what
amounted to a snub He went back to his chair against the wall and sat
there waiting for the end

It was an hour before the sheriff returned and he came in scowling

Ill see you now he said briefly and led the way back to the hotel
office behind the desk Bassetts last hope died when he saw sitting
there pale but composed the elderly maid The sheriff lost no time

Now Ill tell you what we know about your connection with this case
Bassett he said You engaged a car to take you both to the main line
tonight You paid off Clarks room as well as your own this afternoon
When you found he was sick you canceled your going Thats true isnt
it

It is Ive told you I knew him at home but not as Clark

Ill let that go You intended to take the midnight on the main line
but you ordered a car instead of using the branch road

Livingstone was sick I thought it would be easier Thats all His
voice sharpened You cant drag me into this Sheriff In the first
place I dont believe it was Clark or he wouldnt have come here of
all places on the earth I didnt even know he was here until he came
into my room this morning

Why did he come into your room

He had seen that I was registered He said he felt sick I took him
back and put him to bed Tonight I got a doctor

The sheriff felt in his pocket and produced a piece of paper Bassetts
morale was almost destroyed when he saw that it was Gregorys letter to
David

Ill ask you to explain this It was on Clarks bed

Bassett took it and read it slowly He was thinking hard

I see he said Well that explains why he came here He was too sick
to talk when I saw him You see this is not addressed to him but to
his uncle David Livingstone David Livingstone is a brother of Henry
Livingstone who died some years ago at Dry River This refers to a
personal matter connected with the Livingstone estate

The sheriff took the letter and reread it He was puzzled

Youre a good talker he acknowledged grudgingly He turned to the
maid

All right Hattie he said Well have that story again But just
a minute He turned to the reporter Mrs Thorwald here hasnt seen
Lizzie Lazarus the squaw Lizzie has been sitting in my office ever
since noon Now Hattie

Hattie moistened her dry lips

It was Jud Clark all right she said I knew him all his life off
and on But I wish I hadnt screamed I dont believe he killed Lucas
and I never will I hope he gets away

She eyed the sheriff vindictively but he only smiled grimly

What did I tell you he said to Bassett Hell with the womenthat
was Jud Clark And well get him Hattie Dont worry Go on

She looked at Bassett

When you left me I sat outside the door as you said Then I heard him
moving and I went in The room was not very light and I didnt know
him at first He sat up in bed and looked at me and he said Why
hello Hattie Thorwald Thats my name I married a Swede Then
he looked again and he said Excuse me I thought you were a Mrs
Thorwald but I see now youre older I recognized him then and I
thought I was going to faint I knew hed be arrested the moment it was
known he was here I said Lie down Mr Jud Youre not very well
And I closed the door and locked it I was scared

Her voice broke she fumbled for a handkerchief The sheriff glanced at
Bassett

Now wheres your Livingstone story he demanded All right Hattie
Lets have it

I said For Gods sake Mr Jud lie still until I think what to
do The sheriffs likely downstairs this very minute And then he went
queer and wild He jumped off the bed and stood listening and staring
and shaking all over Ive got to get away he said very loud I
wont let them take me Ill kill myself first When I put my hand on
his arm he threw it off and he made for the door I saw then that he
was delirious with fever and I stood in front of the door and begged
him not to go out But he threw me away so hard that that I fell and I
screamed

And then what

Thats all If I hadnt been almost out of my mind Id never have told
that it was Jud Clark Thatll hang on me dying day

An hour or so later Bassett went back to his room in a state of mental
and nervous exhaustion He knew that from that time on he would be under
suspicion and probably under espionage and he proceeded methodically
his door locked to go over his papers His notebook and the cuttings
from old files relative to the Clark case he burned in his wash basin
and then carefully washed the basin That done his attendance on a sick
man and the letter found on the bed was all the positive evidence they
had to connect him with the case He had had some thought of slipping
out by the fireescape and making a search for Dick on his own account
but his lack of familiarity with his surroundings made that practically
useless

At midnight he stretched out on his bed without undressing and went
over the situation carefully He knew nothing of the various neuroses
which affect the human mind but he had a vague impression that
memory when lost did eventually return and Dicks recognition of the
chambermaid pointed to such a return He wondered what a man would
feel under such conditions what he would think He could not do it He
abandoned the effort finally and lay frowning at the ceiling while he
considered his own part in the catastrophe He saw himself following
his training and his instinct leading the inevitable march toward this
nights tragedy planning scheming searching and now that it had
come lying helpless on his bed while the procession of events went on
past him and beyond his control

When an automobile engine backfired in the street below he went sick
with fear

He made the resolution then that was to be the guiding motive for his
life for the next few months to fight the thing of his own creating to
a finish But with the resolution newly made he saw the futility of
it He might fight would fight but nothing could restore to Dick
Livingstone the place he had made for himself in the world He might be
saved from his past but he could not be given a future

All at once he was aware that some one was working stealthily at
the lock of the door which communicated with a room beyond He slid
cautiously off the bed and went to the light switch standing with a
hand on it and waited The wild thought that it might be Livingstone
was uppermost in his mind and when the door creaked open and closed
again that was the word he breathed into the darkness

No said a womans voice in a whisper Its the maid Hattie Be
careful Theres a guard at the top of the stairs

He heard her moving to his outer door and he knew that she stood
there listening her head against the panel When she was satisfied she
slipped with the swiftness of familiarity with her surroundings to the
stand beside his bed and turned on the lamp In the shaded light he saw
that she wore a dark cape with its hood drawn over her head In some
strange fashion the maid even the woman was lost and she stood
strange mysterious and dramatic in the little room

If you found Jud Clark what would you do with him she demanded From
beneath the hood her eyes searched his face Turn him over to Wilkins
and his outfit

I think you know better than that

Have you got any plan

Plan No Theyve got every outlet closed havent they Do you know
where he is

I know where he isnt or theyd have him by now And I know Jud Clark
Hed take to the mountains same as he did before Hes got a good
horse

A horse

Listen I havent told this and I dont mean to Theyll learn it in
a couple of hours anyhow He got out by a back fireescapethey know
that But they dont know he took Ed Ricketts black mare They think
hes on foot Ive been down there now and shes gone Eds shut up in
a room on the top floor playing poker They wont break up until about
three oclock and hell miss his horse then Thats two hours yet

Bassett tried to see her face in the shadow of the hood He was puzzled
and suspicious at her change of front more than half afraid of a trap

How do I know you are not working with Wilkins he demanded You
could have saved the situation tonight by saying you werent sure

I was upset Ive had time to think since

He was forced to trust her eventually although the sense of some
hidden motive some urge greater than compassion persisted in him

Youve got some sort of plan for me then I cant follow him haphazard
into the mountains at night and expect to find him

Yes He was delirious when he left That thing about the sheriff being
after himhe wasnt after him then Not until I gave the alarm Hes
delirious and he thinks hes back to the night heyou know Wouldnt
he do the same thing again and make for the mountains and the cabin He
went to the cabin before

Bassett looked at his watch It was half past twelve

Even if I could get a horse I couldnt get out of the town

You might on foot Theyll be trailing Ricketts horse by dawn And if
you can get out of town I can get you a horse I can get you out too I
think I know every foot of the place

A feeling of theatrical unreality was Bassetts chief emotion during the
trying time that followed The cloaked and shrouded figure of the woman
ahead the passage through two dark and empty rooms by pass key to an
unguarded corridor in the rear the descent of the fireescape where
they stood flattened against the wall while a man possibly one of the
posse rode in tied his horse and stamped in high heeled boots into the
building and always just ahead the sure movement and silent tread of
the woman kept his nerves taut and increased his feeling of the unreal

At the foot of the fireescape the woman slid out of sight noiselessly
but under Bassetts feet a tin can rolled and clattered Then a horse
snorted close to his shoulder and he was frozen with fright After
that she gave him her hand and led him through an empty outbuilding and
another yard into a street

At two oclock that morning Bassett waiting in a lonely road near what
he judged to be the camp of a drilling crew heard a horse coming toward
him and snorting nervously as it came and drew back into the shadows
until he recognized the shrouded silhouette leading him

It belongs to my son she said Ill fix it with him tomorrow But
if youre caught youll have to say you came out and took him or youll
get us all in trouble

She gave him careful instructions as to how to find the trail and urged
him to haste

If you get him she advised better keep right on over the range

He paused with his foot in the stirrup

You seem pretty certain hes taken to the mountains

Its your only chance Theyll get him anywhere else

He mounted and prepared to ride off He would have shaken hands with
her but the horse was still terrified at her shrouded figure and
veered and snorted when she approached However it turns out he said
youve done your best and Im grateful

The horse moved off and left her standing there her cowl drawn forward
and her hands crossed on her breast She stood for a moment facing
toward the mountains oddly monkish in outline and posture Then she
turned back toward the town

Dick had picked up life again where he had left it off so long before
Gone was Davids house built on the sands of forgetfulness Gone was
David himself and Lucy Gone not even born into his consciousness
was Elizabeth The war his work his new place in the world were all
obliterated drowned in the flood of memories revived by the shock of
Bassetts revelations

Not that the breaking point had revealed itself as such at once There
was confusion first then stupor and unconsciousness and out of that
sharply and clearly came memory It was not ten years ago but an hour
ago a minute ago that he had stood staring at Howard Lucas on the
floor of the billiard room and had seen Beverly run in through the
door

Bev he was saying Bev Dont look like that

He moved and found he was in bed It had been a dream He drew a long
breath looked about the room saw the woman and greeted her But
already he knew he had not been dreaming Things were sharpening in his
mind He shuddered and looked at the floor but nobody lay there Only
the horror in his mind and the instinct to get away from it He was not
thinking at all but rising in him was not only the need for flight but
the sense of pursuit They were after him They would get him They must
never get him alive

Instinct and will took the place of thought and whatever closed chamber
in his brain had opened it clearly influenced his physical condition
He bore all the stigmata of prolonged and heavy drinking his nerves
were gone he twitched and shook When he got down the fireescape his
legs would scarcely hold him

The discovery of Ed Ricketts horse in the courtyard saddled and ready
fitted in with the brain pattern of the past

Like one who enters a room for the first time to find it already
familiar for a moment he felt that this thing that he was doing he
had done before Only for a moment Then partial memory ceased and he
climbed into the saddle rode out and turned toward the mountains and
the cabin By that strange quality of the brain which is called habit
although the habit be of only one emphatic precedent he followed the
route he had taken ten years before How closely will never be known
Did he stop at this turn to look back as he had once before Did he let
his horse breathe there Not the latter probably for as following the
blind course that he had followed ten years before he left the town and
went up the canyon trail he was riding as though all the devils of hell
were behind him

One thing is certain The reproduction of the conditions of the earlier
flight the familiar associations of the trail must have helped rather
than hindered his fixation in the past Again he was Judson Clark who
had killed a man and was flying from himself and from pursuit

Before long his horse was in acute distress but he did not notice it
At the top of the long climb the animal stopped but he kicked him on
recklessly He was as unaware of his own fatigue or that he was swaying
in the saddle until galloping across a meadow the horse stumbled and
threw him

He lay still for some time not hurt but apparently lacking the
initiative to get up again He had at that period the alternating
lucidity and mental torpor of the half drunken man But struggling up
through layers of blackness at last there came again the instinct for
flight and he got on the horse and set off

The torpor again overcame him and he slept in the saddle When the
horse stopped he roused and kicked it on Once he came up through the
blackness to the accompaniment of a great roaring and found that the
animal was saddle deep in a ford and floundering badly among the rocks
He turned its head upstream and got it out safely

Toward dawn some of the confusion was gone but he firmly fixed in the
past The horse wandered on head down occasionally stopping to seize a
leaf as it passed and once to drink deeply at a spring Dick was still
not thinkingthere was something that forbade him to thinkbut he was
weak and emotional He muttered

Poor Bev Poor old Bev

A great wave of tenderness and memory swept over him Poor Bev He
had made life hell for her all right He had an almost uncontrollable
impulse to turn the horse around go back and see her once more He was
gone anyhow They would get him And he wanted her to know that he would
have died rather than do what he had done

The flight impulse died he felt sick and very cold and now and then he
shook violently He began to watch the trail behind him for the pursuit
but without fear He seemed to have been wandering for a thousand black
nights through deep gorges and over peaks as high as the stars and now
he wanted to rest to stop somewhere and sleep to be warm again Let
them come and take him anywhere out of this nightmare

With the dawn still gray he heard a horse behind and below him on the
trail up the cliff face He stopped and sat waiting twisted about
in his saddle his expression ugly and defiant and yet touchingly
helpless the look of a boy in trouble and at bay The horseman came
into sight on the trail below riding hard a middleaged man in a dark
sack suit and a straw hat an oddly incongruous figure and manifestly
weary He rode bent forward and now and again he raised his eyes from
the trail and searched the wall above with bloodshot anxious eyes

On the turn below Dick Bassett saw him for the first time and spoke to
him in a quiet voice

Hello old man he said I began to think I was going to miss you
after all

His scrutiny of Dicks face had rather reassured him The delirium had
passed apparently Dishevelled although he was covered with dust and
with sweat from the horse Livingstones eyes were steady enough As
he rode up to him however he was not so certain He found himself
surveyed with a sort of cool malignity that startled him

Miss me Livingstone sneered bitterly With every damned hill covered
by this time with your outfit Ill tell you this If Id had a gun
youd never have got me alive

Bassett was puzzled and slightly ruffled

My outfit Ill tell you this son Ive risked my neck half the night
to get you out of this mess

God Almighty couldnt get me out of this mess Dick said somberly

It was then that Bassett saw something not quite normal in his face and
he rode closer

See here Livingstone he said in a soothing tone nobodys going to
get you Im here to keep them from getting you Weve got a good start
but well have to keep moving

Dick sat obstinately still his horse turned across the trail and his
eyes still suspicious and unfriendly

I dont know you he said doggedly And Ive done all the running
away Im going to do You go back and tell Wilkins Im here and to come
and get me The sooner the better The sneer faded and he turned
on Bassett with a depth of tragedy in his eyes that frightened the
reporter My God he said I killed a man last night I cant go
through life with that on me Im done I tell you

Last night Some faint comprehension began to dawn in Bassetts mind
a suspicion of the truth But there was no time to verify it He turned
and carefully inspected the trail to where it came into sight at the
opposite rim of the valley When he was satisfied that the pursuit was
still well behind them he spoke again

Pull yourself together Livingstone he said rather sharply Think
a bit You didnt kill anybody last night Now listen he added
impressively You are Livingstone Doctor Richard Livingstone You
stick to that and think about it

But Dick was not listening save to some bitter inner voice for
suddenly he turned his horse around on the trail Get out of the way
he said Im going back to give myself up

He would have done it probably would have crowded past Bassett on
the narrow trail and headed back toward capture but for his horse It
balked and whirled on the ledge but it would not pass Bassett Dick
swore and kicked it his face ugly and determined but it refused
sullenly He slid out of the saddle then and tried to drag it on but he
was suddenly weak and sick He staggered Bassett was off his horse in
a moment and caught him He eased him onto a boulder and he sat there
his shoulders sagging and his whole body twitching

Been drinking my head off he said at last If I had a drink now Id
straighten out He tried to sit up Thats whats the matter with me
Im funking of course but thats not all Id give my soul for some
whisky

I can get you a drink if youll come on about a mile Bassett coaxed
At the cabin you and I talked about yesterday

Now youre talking Dick made an effort and got to his feet shaking
off Bassetts assisting arm For Gods sake keep your hands off me he
said irritably Ive got a hangover thats all

He got into his saddle without assistance and started off up the trail
Bassett once more searched the valley but it was empty save for a deer
drinking at the stream far below He turned and followed

He was fairly hopeless by that time what with Dicks unexpected
resistance and the change in the man himself He was dealing with
something he did not understand and the hypothesis of delirium did
not hold There was a sort of desperate sanity in Dicks eyes That
statement now about drinking his head offhe hadnt looked yesterday
like a drinking man But now he did He was twitching his hands shook
On the rock his face had been covered with a cold sweat What was
that the doctor yesterday had said about delirium tremens Suppose he
collapsed That meant capture

He did not need to guide Dick to the cabin He turned off the trail
himself and Bassett following saw him dismount and survey the ruin
with a puzzled face But he said nothing Bassett waiting outside to tie
the horses came in to find him sitting on one of the dilapidated chairs
staring around but all he said was

Get me that drink wont you Im going to pieces Bassett found his
tin cup where he had left it on a shelf and poured out a small amount of
whisky from his flask

This is all we have he explained Well have to go slow with it

It had an almost immediate effect The twitching grew less and a faint
color came into Dicks face He stood up and stretched himself Thats
better he said I was all in I must have been riding that infernal
horse for years

He wandered about while the reporter made a fire and set the coffee pot
to boil Bassett glancing up once saw him surveying the ruined leanto
from the doorway with an expression he could not understand But he did
not say anything nor did he speak again until Bassett called him to get
some food Even then he was laconic and he seemed to be listening and
waiting

Once something startled the horses outside and he sat up and listened

Theyre here he said

I dont think so Bassett replied and went to the doorway No he
called back over his shoulder you go on and finish Ill watch

Come back and eat Dick said surlily

He ate very little but drank of the coffee Bassett too ate almost
nothing He was pulling himself together for the struggle that was to
come marshaling his arguments for flight and trying to fathom the
extent of the change in the man across the small table

Dick put down his tin cup and got up He was strong again and the
nightmare confusion of the night had passed away Instead of it
there was a desperate lucidity and a courage born of desperation He
remembered it all distinctly he had killed Howard Lucas the night
before Before long Wilkins or some of his outfit would ride up to the
door and take him back to Norada He was not afraid of that They would
always think he had run away because he was afraid of capture but it
was not that He had run away from Bevs face Only he had not got away
from it It had been with him all night and it was with him now

But he would have to go back He couldnt be caught like a rat in a
trap The Clarks didnt run away They were fighters Only the Clarks
didnt kill They fought but they didnt murder

He picked up his hat and went to the door

Well youve been mighty kind old man he said But Ive got to go
back I ran last night like a scared kid but Im through with that sort
of foolishness

Id give a good bit Bassett said watching him to know what made
you run last night You were safe where you were

I dont know what you are talking about Dick said drearily I
didnt run from them I ran to get away from something He turned away
irritably You wouldnt understand Say I was drunk I was for that
matter Im not over it yet

Bassett watched him

I see he said quietly It was last night was it that this thing
happened

You know it dont you

And after it happened do you remember what followed

Ive been riding all night I didnt care what happened I knew Id run
into a whale of a blizzard but I

He stopped and stared outside to where the horses grazed in the upland
meadow knee deep in mountain flowers Bassett watching him saw the
incredulity in his eyes and spoke very gently

My dear fellow he said you are right Try to understand what I am
saying and take it easy You rode into a blizzard right enough But
that was not last night It was ten years ago




XXIX

Had Bassett had some wider knowledge of Dicks condition he might have
succeeded better during that bad hour that followed Certainly if he
had hoped that the mere statement of fact and its proof would bring
results he failed And the need for haste the fear of the pursuit
behind them made him nervous and incoherent

He had first to accept the incredible himselfthat Dick Livingstone no
longer existed that he had died and was buried deep in some chamber of
an unconscious mind He made every effort to revive him to restore him
into the field of consciousness but without result And his struggle
was increased in difficulty by the fact that he knew so little of Dicks
life Davids name meant nothing apparently and it was the only name
he knew He described the Livingstone house he described Elizabeth as
he had seen her that night at the theater Even Minnie But Dick only
shook his head And until he had aroused some instinct some desire to
live he could not combat Dicks intention to return and surrender

I understand what you are saying Dick would say Im trying to get
it But it doesnt mean anything to me

He even tried the war

War What war Dick asked And when he heard about it he groaned

A war he said And Ive missed it

But soon after that he got up and moved to the door

Im going back he said

Why

Theyre after me arent they

Youre forgetting again Why should they be after you now after ten
years

I see I cant get it you know I keep listening for them

Bassett too was listening but he kept his fears to himself

Why did you do it he asked finally

I was drunk and I hated him He married a girl I was crazy about

Bassett tried new tactics He stressed the absurdity of surrendering for
a crime committed ten years before and forgotten

They wont convict you anyhow he urged It was a quarrel wasnt it
I mean you didnt deliberately shoot him

I dont remember We quarreled Yes I dont remember shooting him

What do you remember

Dick made an effort although he was white to the lips

I saw him on the floor he said slowly and staggered a little

Then you dont even know you did it

I hated him

But Bassett saw that his determination to surrender himself was
weakening Bassett fought it with every argument he could summon and at
last he brought forward the one he felt might be conclusive

You see youve not only made a mans place in the world Clark as
Ive told you Youve formed associations you cant get away from
Youve got to think of the Livingstones and you told me yesterday a
shock would kill the old man But its more than that Theres a girl
back in your town I think you were engaged to her

But if he had hoped to pierce the veil with that statement he failed
Dicks face flushed and he went to the door of the cabin much as he
had gone to the window the day before He did not look around when he
spoke

Then Im an unconscionable cad he said Ive only cared for one
woman in my life And Ive shipwrecked her for good

You mean

You know who I mean

Sometime later Bassett got on his horse and rode out to a ledge which
commanded a long stretch of trail in the valley below Far away horsemen
were riding along it one behind the other small dots that moved on
slowly but steadily He turned and went back to the cabin

Wed better be moving he said and its up to you to say where
Youve got two choices You can go back to Norada and run the chance of
arrest You know what that means Without much chance of a conviction
you will stand trial and bring wretchedness to the people who stood by
you before and who care for you now Or you can go on over the mountains
with me and strike the railroad somewhere to the West Youll have time
to think things over anyhow Theyve waited ten years They can wait
longer

To his relief Dick acquiesced He had become oddly passive he seemed
indeed not greatly interested He did not even notice the haste with
which Bassett removed the evidences of their meal or extinguished the
dying fire and scattered the ashes Nor when they were mounted the
care with which they avoided the trail He gave when asked information
as to the direction of the railroad at the foot of the western slope of
the range and at the same instigation found a trail for them some miles
beyond their starting point But mostly he merely followed in a dead
silence

They made slow progress Both horses were weary and hungry and the
going was often rough and even dangerous But for Dicks knowledge of
the country they would have been hopelessly lost Bassett however
although tortured with muscular soreness felt his spirits rising as the
miles were covered and there was no sign of the pursuit

By midafternoon they were obliged to rest their horses and let them
graze and the necessity of food for themselves became insistent Dick
stretched out and was immediately asleep but the reporter could not
rest The magnitude of his undertaking obsessed him They had covered
perhaps twenty miles since leaving the cabin and the railroad was still
sixty miles away With fresh horses they could have made it by dawn of
the next morning but he did not believe their jaded animals could go
much farther The country grew worse instead of better A pass ahead
which they must cross was full of snow

He was anxious too as to Dicks physical condition The twitching was
gone but he was very pale and he slept like a man exhausted and at his
physical limit But the necessity of crossing the pass before nightfall
or of waiting until dawn to do it drove Bassett back from an anxious
reconnoitering of the trail at five oclock to rouse the sleeping man
and start on again

Near the pass however Dick roused himself and took the lead

Let me ahead Bassett he said peremptorily And give your horse his
head Hell take care of you if you give him a chance

Bassett was glad to fall back He was exhausted and nervous The trail
frightened him It clung to the side of a rocky wall twisting and
turning on itself it ran under milky waterfalls of glacial water and
higher up it led over an ice field which was a glassy bridge over a
rushing stream beneath To add to their wretchedness mosquitoes hung
about them in voracious clouds and tiny black gnats which got into
their eyes and their nostrils and set the horses frantic

Once across the ice field Dicks horse fell and for a time could not get
up again He lay making ineffectual efforts to rise his sides heaving
his eyes rolling in distress They gave up then and prepared to make
such camp as they could

With the setting of the sun it had grown bitterly cold and Bassett was
forced to light a fire He did it under the protection of the mountain
wall and Dick after unsaddling his fallen horse built a rough shelter
of rocks against the wind After a time the exhausted horse got up but
there was no forage and the two animals stood disconsolate or made
small hopeless excursions noses to the ground among the moss and scrub
pines

Before turning in Bassett divided the remaining contents of the flask
between them and his last cigarettes Dick did not talk He sat his
back to the shelter facing the fire his mind busy with what Bassett
knew were bitter and conflicting thoughts Once however as the
reporter was dozing off Dick spoke

You said I told you there was a girl he said Did I tell you her
name

No

All right Go to sleep I thought if I heard it it might help

Bassett lay back and watched him

Better get some sleep old man he said

He dozed to waken again cold and shivering The fire had burned low
and Dick was sitting near it unheeding and in a deep study He looked
up and Bassett was shocked at the quiet tragedy in his face

Where is Beverly Carlysle now he asked Or do you know

Yes I saw her not long ago

Is she married again

No Shes revived The Valley and shes in New York with it

Dick slept for only an hour or so that night but as he slept he
dreamed In his dream he was at peace and happy and there was a girl
in a black frock who seemed to be a part of that peace When he roused
however still with the warmth of his dream on him he could not summon
her She had slipped away among the shadows of the night

He sat by the fire in the grip of a great despair He had lost ten years
out of his life his best years And he could not go back to where he
had left off There was nothing to go back to but shame and remorse
He looked at Bassett lying by the fire and tried to fit him into the
situation Who was he and why was he here Why had he ridden out at
night alone into unknown mountains to find him

As though his intent gaze had roused the sleeper Bassett opened his
eyes at first drowsily then wide awake He raised himself on his
elbow and listened as though for some faroff sound and his face was
strained and anxious But the night was silent and he relaxed and slept
again

Something that had been forming itself in Dicks mind suddenly
crystallized into conviction He rose and walked to the edge of the
mountain wall and stood there listening When he went back to the
fire he felt in his pockets found a small pad and pencil and bending
forward to catch the light commenced to write At dawn Bassett
wakened He was stiff and wretched and he grunted as he moved He
turned over and surveyed the small plateau It was empty except for his
horse making its continuous hopeless search for grass




XXX

David was enjoying his holiday He lay in bed most of the morning
making the most of his one afterbreakfast cigar and surrounded by
newspaper and magazines He had made friends of the waiter who brought
his breakfast and of the little chambermaid who looked after his room
and such conversations as this would follow

Well Nellie he would say and did you go to the dance on the pier
last night

Oh yes doctor

Your gentleman friend showed up all right then

Oh yes He didnt telephone because he was on a job out of town

Here perhaps David would lower his voice for Lucy was never far away

Did you wear the flowers

Yes violets I put one away to remember you by It was funny at first
I wouldnt tell him who gave them to me

David would chuckle delightedly

Thats right he would say Keep him guessing the young rascal We
men are kittle cattle Nellie kittle cattle

Even the valet unbent to him and inquired if the doctor needed a man at
home to look after him and his clothes David was enormously tickled

Well he said with a twinkle in his eye Ill tell you how I manage
now and then youll see When I want my trousers pressed I send them
downstairs and then I wait in my bathrobe until they come back Im a
trifle better off for boots but youd have to knock Mike my hired man
unconscious before hed let you touch them

The valet grinned understandingly

Of course theres my nephew David went on a little note of pride in
his voice Hes become engaged recently and I notice hes bought some
clothes But still I dont think even he will want anybody to hold his
trousers while he gets into them

David chuckled over that for a long time after the valet had gone

He was quite happy and contented He spent all afternoon in a roller
chair conversing affably with the man who pushed him and now and
then when Lucy was out of sight getting out and stretching his legs He
picked up lost children and lonely dogs and tried his eye in a shooting
gallery and had hard work keeping off the roller coasters and out of
the sea

Then one day when he had been gone some time he was astonished on
entering his hotel to find Harrison Miller sitting in the lobby David
beamed with surprise and pleasure

You old humbug he said Off on a jaunt after all And the contempt
of you when I was shipped here

Harrison Miller was constrained and uncomfortable He had meant to see
Lucy first She was a sensible woman and she would know just what David
could stand or could not But David did not notice his constraint took
him to his room made him admire the ocean view gave him a cigar and
then sat down across from him beaming and hospitable

Suffering Crimus Miller he said I didnt know I was homesick until
I saw you Well hows everything Dicks letters havent been much and
we havent had any for several days

Harrison Miller cleared his throat He knew that David had not been
told of Jim Wheelers death but that Lucy knew He knew too from Walter
Wheeler that David did not know that Dick had gone west Did Lucy know
that or not Probably yes But he considered the entire benevolent
conspiracy an absurdity and a mistake It was making him uncomfortable
and most of his life had been devoted to being comfortable

He decided to temporize

Things are about the same he said Theyre going to pave Chisholm
Street And your Mike knocked down the night watchman last week I got
him off with a fine

I hope he hasnt been in my cellar Hes got a weakness but
thenHows Dick Not overworking

No Hes all right

But David was no mans fool He began to see something strange in
Harrisons manner and he bent forward in his chair

Look here Harrison he said theres something the matter with you
Youve got something on your mind

Well I have and I havent Id like to see Lucy David if shes
about

Lucys gadding You can tell me if you can her What is it Is it about
Dick

In a way yes

Hes not sick

No Hes all right as far as I know I guess Id better tell you
David Walter Wheeler has got some sort of bee in his bonnet and he
got me to come on Dick was pretty tired andwell one or two things
happened to worry him One was that Jim Wheeleryoull get this sooner
or laterwas in an automobile accident and it did for him

David had lost some of his ruddy color It was a moment before he spoke

Poor Jim he said hoarsely He was a good boy only full of life It
will be hard on the family

Yes Harrison Miller said simply

But David was resentful too When his friends were in trouble he wanted
to know about it He was somewhat indignant and not a little hurt But
he soon reverted to Dick

Ill go back and send him off for a rest he said Im as good as
Ill ever be and the boys tired Whats the bee in Wheelers bonnet

Look here David you know your own business best and Wheeler didnt
feel at liberty to tell me very much But he seemed to think you were
the only one who could tell us certain things Hed have come himself
but its not easy for him to leave the family just now Dick went away
just after Jims funeral He left a young chap named Reynolds in his
place and I believe in order not to worry you some letters to be
mailed at intervals

Went where David asked in a terrible voice

To a town called Norada in Wyoming Near his old home somewhere And
the Wheelers havent heard anything from him since the day he got there
Thats three weeks ago He wrote Elizabeth the night he got there and
wired her at the same time Theres been nothing since

David was gripping the arms of his chair with both hands but he forced
himself to calmness

Ill go to Norada at once he said Get a timetable Harrison and
ring for the valet

Not on your life you wont Im here to do that when Ive got
something to go on Wheeler thought you might have heard from him If
you hadnt I was to get all the information I could and then start
Elizabeths almost crazy We wired the chief of police of Norada
yesterday

Yes David said thickly Trust your friends to make every damned
mistake possible Youve set the whole pack on his trail And then he
fell back in his chair and gasped Open the window

When Lucy came in a half hour later she found David on his bed with
the hotel doctor beside him and Harrison Miller in the room David was
fighting for breath but he was conscious and very calm He looked up at
her and spoke slowly and distinctly

Theyve got Dick Lucy he said

He looked aged and pinched and entirely hopeless Even after his heart
had quieted down and he lay still among his pillows he gave no evidence
of his old fighting spirit He lay with his eyes shut relaxed and
passive He had done his best and he had failed It was out of his
hands now and in the hands of God Once as he lay there he prayed He
said that he had failed and that now he was too old and weak to fight
That God would have to take it on and do the best He could But he
added that if God did not save Dick and bring him back to happiness
that he David was through

Toward morning he wakened from a light sleep The door into Lucys room
was open and a dim light was burning beyond it David called her and by
her immediate response he knew she had not been sleeping

Yes David she said and came padding in in her bedroom slippers
and wadded dressinggown a tragic figure of apprehension determinedly
smiling What do you want

Sit down Lucy

When she had done so he put out his hand fumbling for hers She was
touched and alarmed for it was a long while since there had been any
open demonstration of affection between them David was silent for a
time absorbed in thought Then

Im not in very good shape Lucy I suppose you know that This old
pump of mine has sprung a leak or something I dont want you to worry
if anything happens Ive come to the time when Ive got a good many
over there and it will be like going home

Lucy nodded Her chin quivered She smoothed his hand with its high
twisted veins

I know David she said Mother and father and Henry and a good
many friends But I need you too Youre all I have now that Dick

Thats why I called you If I can get out there Ill go And Ill put
up a fight that will make them wish theyd never started anything But
if I cant if I She felt his fingers tighten on her hand If Hattie
Thorwald is still living well put her on the stand If I cant go
for any reason I want you to see that she is called And you know where
Henrys statement is

In your box isnt it

Yes Have the statement read first and then have her called to
corroborate it Tell the story I have told youor no Ill dictate it
to you in the morning and sign it before witnesses Jake and Bill will
testify too

He felt easier in his mind after that He had marshalled his forces and
begun his preparations for battle He felt less apprehension now in case
he fell asleep to waken among those he had loved long since and lost
awhile After a few moments his eyes closed and Lucy went back to her
bed and crawled into it

It was however Harrison Miller who took the statement that morning
Lucys cramped old hand wrote too slowly for Davids impatience
Harrison Miller took it on hotel stationery covering the carefully
numbered pages with his neat copperplate writing He wrote with an
impassive face but with intense interest for by that time he knew
Dicks story

Never in his orderly bachelor life of daily papers and a flower garden
and political economy at night had he been so close to the passions of
men to love and hate and the disorder they brought with them




XXXI

My brother Henry Livingstone was not a strong man David dictated
He had the same heart condition I have but it developed earlier After
he left college he went to Arizona and bought a ranch and there he
met and chummed with Elihu Clark who had bought an old mine and was
reworking it Henry loaned him a small amount of money at that time and
a number of years later in return for that when Henrys health failed
Clark who had grown wealthy bought him a ranch in Wyoming at Dry
River not far from Clarks own property

Henry had been teaching in an Eastern university and then taken up
tutoring We saw little of him He was a student and he became almost a
recluse I saw less of him than ever after Clark gave him the ranch

In the spring of 1910 Henry wrote me that he was not well and I went
out to see him He seemed worried and was in bad shape physically Elihu
Clark had died five years before and left him a fair sum of money
fifty thousand dollars but he was living in a way which made me think
he was not using it The ranch buildings were dilapidated and there was
nothing but the barest necessities in the house

I taxed Henry with miserliness and he then told me that the money was
not his but left to him to be used for an illegitimate son of Clarks
born before his marriage the child of a small ranchers daughter named
Hattie Burgess The Burgess girl had gone to Omaha for its birth and
the story was not known In early years Clark had paid the childs board
through his lawyer to an Omaha woman named Hines and had later sent him
to college The Burgess girl married a Swede named Thorwald The boy was
eight years older than Judson Clarks legitimate son

After the death of his wife Elihu Clark began to think about the child
especially after Judson became a fairsized boy He had the older boy
who went by the name of Hines sent to college and in summer he stayed
at Henrys tutoring school Henry said the boy was like the Burgess
family blonde and excitable and rather commonplace He did not get on
well at college and did not graduate So far as he knew Clark never
saw him

The boy himself believed that he was an orphan and that the Hines
woman had adopted him as a foundling But on the death of the woman he
found that she had no estate and that a firm of New York attorneys had
been paying his college bills

He had spent considerable time with Henry one way and another and
he began to think that Henry knew who he was He thought at first that
Henry was his father and there was some trouble In order to end it
Henry finally acknowledged that he knew who the father was and after
that he had no peace Cliftonhis name was Clifton Hinesattacked
Henry once and if it had not been for the two men on the place he would
have hurt him

Henry began to give him money Clark had left the fifty thousand for
the boy with the idea that Henry should start him in business with it
But he only turned up wildcat schemes that Henry would not listen to
He did not know how Henry got the money or from where He thought for a
long time that Henry had saved it

Id better say here that Henry was fond of Clifton although he didnt
approve of him Hed never married and the boy was like a son to him
for a good many years He didnt have him at the ranch much however
for he was a Burgess through and through and looked like them And he
was always afraid that somehow the story would get out

Then Clifton learned somehow or other of Clarks legacy to Henry and
he put two and two together There was a bad time but Henry denied it
and they went upstairs to bed That night Clifton broke into Henrys
desk and found some letters from Elihu Clark that told the story

He almost went crazy He took the papers up to Henrys and wakened him
standing over Henry with them in hand and shaking all over I think
they had a struggle too All Henry told me was that he took them from
him and threw them in the fire

That was a year before Henry died and at the time young Jud Clarks
name was in all the newspapers He had left college after a wild
career there and although Elihu had tied up the property until Jud was
twentyone Jud had his mothers estate and a big allowance Then too
he borrowed on his prospects and he lost a hundred thousand dollars at
Monte Carlo within six weeks after he graduated

One way and another he was always in the newspapers and when he saw
how Jud was throwing money away Clifton went wild

As Henry had burned the letters he had no proofs He didnt know who
his mother was but he set to work to find out He ferreted into Elihus
past life and he learned something about Hattie Burgess or Thorwald
She was married by that time and lived on a little ranch near Norada
He went to see her and he accused her downright of being his mother It
must have been a bad time for her for after all he was her son and
she had to disclaim him She had a husband and a boy by that husband
however by that time and she was desperate She threw him off the
track somehow lied and talked him down and then went to bed in
collapse She sent for Henry later and told him

The queer thing was that as soon as she saw him she wanted him He
was her son She went to Henry one night and said she had perjured her
soul and that she wanted him back She wasnt in love with Thorwald
I think shed always cared for Clark She went away finally however
after promising Henry she would keep Clarks secret But I have a
suspicion that later on she acknowledged the truth to the boy

What he wanted of course was a share of the Clark estate Of course
he hadnt a chance in law but he saw a chance to blackmail young Jud
Clark and he tried it Not personally for he hadnt any real courage
but by mail Clarks attorneys wrote back saying they would jail him if
he tried it again and he went back to Dry River and after Henry again

That was in the spring of 1911 Henry was uneasy for Clifton was not
like himself He had spells of brooding and he took to making long
trips on his horse into the mountains and coming in with the animal run
to death Henry thought too that he was seeing the Thorwald woman
the mother Thorwald had died and she was living with the son on their
ranch and trying to sell it He thought Hines was trying to have her
make a confession which would give him a hold on Jud Clark

Henry was not well and in the early fall he knew he hadnt long to
live He wrote out the story and left it in his desk for me to read
after he had gone and as he added to it from time to time when I got
it it was almost up to date

Judson came back to the Clark ranch in September bringing along an
actress named Beverly Carlysle and her husband Howard Lucas There was
considerable talk because it was known Jud had been infatuated with
the woman But no one saw much of the party outside of the ranch The
Carlysle woman seemed to be a lady but the story was that both men were
drinking a good bit especially Jud

Henry wrote that Hines had been in the East for some months at that
time and that he had not heard from him But he felt that it was only a
truce and that he would turn up again hell bent for trouble He made
a will and left the money to me with instructions to turn it over
to Hines It is still in the bank and amounts to about thirtyfive
thousand dollars It is not mine and I will not touch it But I have
never located Clifton Hines

In the last entry in his record I call attention to my brothers
statement that he did not regard Clifton Hines as entirely sane on this
one matter and to his conviction that the hatred Hines then bore him
amounting to a delusion of persecution might on his death turn against
Judson Clark He instructed me to go to Clark tell him the story and
put him on his guard

Clark and his party had been at the ranch only a day or two when one
night Hines turned up at Dry River He wanted the fifty thousand or
what was left of it and when he failed to move Henry he attacked him
The two men on the place heard the noise and ran in but Hines got away
Henry swore them to secrecy and told them the story He felt he might
need help

From what the two men at the ranch told me when I got there I think
Hines stayed somewhere in the mountains for the next day or two and
that he came down for food the night Henry died

Just what he contributed to Henrys death I do not know Henry fell in
one room and was found in bed in another when the hands had been taking
the cattle to the winter range and hed been alone in the house

When I got there the funeral was over I read the letter he had left
and then I talked to the two hands Bill Ardary and Jake Mazetti They
would not talk at first but I showed them Henrys record and then
they were free enough The autopsy had shown that Henry died from heart
disease but he had a cut on his head also and they believed that Hines
had come back had quarreled with him again and had knocked him down

As Henry had in a way handed over to me his responsibility for the boy
and as I wanted to transfer the money I waited for three weeks at the
ranch hoping he would turn up again I saw the Thorwald woman but she
protested that she did not know where he was And I made two attempts
to see and warn Jud Clark but failed both times Then one night the
Thorwald woman came in looking like a ghost and admitted that Hines
had been hiding in the mountains since Henrys death that he insisted
he had killed him and that he blamed Jud Clark for that and for all
the rest of his troubles She was afraid he would kill Clark The three
of us the two men at the ranch and myself prepared to go into the
mountains and hunt for him before he got snowed in

Then came the shooting at the Clark place and I rode over that night
in a howling storm and helped the coroner and a Norada doctor in the
examination All the evidence was against Clark especially his running
away But I happened on Hattie Thorwald outside on a verandahshed
been working at the houseand I didnt need any conversation to tell me
what she thought All she said was

He didnt do it doctor Hes still in the mountains

Hes been here tonight Hattie and you know it He shot the wrong
man

But she swore he hadnt been and at the end I didnt know Ill say
right now that I dont know But Ill say too that I believe that
is what happened and that Hines probably stayed hidden that night on
Hattie Thorwalds place I went there the next day but she denied it
all and said he was still in the mountains She carried on about the
blizzard and his being frozen to death until I began to think she was
telling the truth

The next day I did what only a tenderfoot would do started into the
mountains alone Bill and Jake were out with a posse after Clark and
I packed up some food and started Ill not go into the details of that
trip I went in from the Dry River Canyon and I guess I faced death a
dozen times the first day I had a map but I lost myself in six hours
I had food and blankets and an axe along and I built a shelter and
stayed there overnight I had to cut up one of my blankets the next
morning and tie up the horses feet so he wouldnt sink too deep in the
snow But it stayed cold and the snow hardened and we got along better
after that

Id have turned back more than once but I thought Id meet up with
some of the sheriffs party I didnt do that but I stumbled on a
trail on the third day toward evening It was the trail made by John
Donaldson as I learned later I followed it but I concluded after a
while that whoever made it was lost too It seemed to be going in a
circle I was in bad shape and had frozen a part of my right hand when
I saw a cabin and there was smoke coming out of the chimney

From that time on Davids statement dealt with the situation in the
cabin with Jud Clark and the Donaldsons and with the snow storm which
began again and lasted for days He spoke at length of his discovery of
Clarks identity and of the fact that the boy had lost all memory of
what had happened and even of who he was He went into that in detail
the peculiar effect of fear and mental shock on a highstrung nature
especially where the physical condition was lowered by excess and
wrongliving his early attempts as the boy improved to pierce the
veil and then his slowgrowing conviction that it were an act of mercy
not to do so The Donaldsons faithfulness the cessation of the search
under the conviction that Clark was dead both were there and also
Davids growing liking for Judson himself But Davids own psychology
was interesting and clearly put

First of all he dictated in his careful old voice it must be
remembered that I was not certain that the boy had committed the crime
I believed and I still believe that Lucas was shot by Clifton Hines
probably through an open window There were no powder marks on the body
I believed too and still believe that Hines had fled after the crime
either to Hattie Thorwalds house or to the mountains In one case he
had escaped and could not be brought to justice and in the other he was
dead and beyond conviction

But there is another element which I urge not in defense but in
explanation The boy Judson Clark was a new slate to write on He had
never had a chance He had had too much money too much liberty too
little responsibility His errors had been wiped away by the loss of his
memory and he had I felt a chance for a new and useful life

I did not come to my decision quickly It was a long fight for his
life for he had contracted pneumonia and he had the drinkers heart
But in the long days of his convalescence while Maggie worked in
the leanto I had time to see what might be done If in making an
experiment with a mans soul I usurped the authority of my Lord and
Master I am sorry But he knows that I did it for the best

I deliberately built up for Judson Clark a new identity He was my
nephew my brother Henrys son He had the traditions of an honorable
family to carry on and those traditions were honor integrity
clean living and work I did not stress love for that I felt must be
experienced not talked about But love was to be the foundation on
which I built The boy had had no love in his life

It has worked out I may not live to see it at its fullest but I defy
the world to produce today a finer or more honorable gentleman a more
useful member of the community And it will last The time may come when
Judson Clark will again be Judson Clark I have expected it for many
years But he will never again be the Judson Clark of ten years ago
He may even will to return to the old reckless ways but as I lie here
perhaps never to see him I say this he cannot go back His character
and habits of thought are established

To convict Judson Clark of the murder of Howard Lucas is to convict
a probably or at least possibly innocent man To convict Richard
Livingstone of that crime is to convict a different man innocent of the
crime innocent of its memory innocent of any single impulse to lift
his hand against a law of God or the state




XXXII

For a month Haverly had buzzed with whispered conjectures It knew
nothing and yet somehow it knew everything Doctor David was ill at
the seashore and Dick was not with him Harrison Miller who was never
known to depart farther from his comfortable hearth than the railway
station in one direction and the Sayre house in the other had made a
trip East and was now in the far West Doctor Reynolds who might or
might not know something had joined the country club and sent for his
golf bag

And Elizabeth Wheeler was going around with a drawn white face and a
determined smile that faded the moment one looked away

The village was hurt and suspicious It resented its lack of knowledge
and turned cynical where had it been taken into confidence it would
have been solicitous It believed that Elizabeth had been jilted for
it knew via Annie and the Oglethorpes laundress that no letters came
from Dick And against Dick its indignation was directed in a hot flame
of mainly feminine anger

But it sensed a mystery too and if it hated a jilt it loved a mystery

Nina had taken to going about with her small pointed chin held high and
angrily she demanded that Elizabeth do the same

You know what they are saying and yet you go about looking crushed

I cant act Nina I do go about

And Nina had a softened moment

Dont think about him she said He isnt sick or he would have
had some one wire or write and he isnt dead or theyd have found his
papers and let us know

Then hes in some sort of trouble I want to go out there I want to go
out there

That indeed had been her constant cry for the last two weeks She
would have done it probably packed her bag and slipped away but she
had no money of her own and even Leslie to whom she appealed had
refused her when he knew her purpose

Were following him up little sister he said Harrison Miller has
gone out and theres enough talk as it is

She thought lying in her bed at night that they were all too afraid
of what people might say It seemed so unimportant to her And she could
not understand the conspiracy of silence Other men went away and were
not heard from and the police were notified and the papers told It
seemed to her too that every one her father and Nina and Leslie and
even Harrison Miller knew more than she did

There had been that long conference behind closed doors when Harrison
Miller came back from seeing David and before he went west Leslie had
been there and even Doctor Reynolds but they had shut her out And her
father had not been the same since

He seemed sometimes to be burning with a sort of inner anger Not at
her however He was very gentle with her

And here was a curious thing She had always felt that she knew when
Dick was thinking of her All at once and without any warning there
would come a glow of happiness and warmth and a sort of surrounding
and encircling sense of protection Rather like what she had felt as a
little girl when she had run home through the terrors of twilight and
closed the house door behind her She was in the warm and lighted house
safe and cared for

That was completely gone It was as though the warm and lighted house
of her love had turned her out and locked the door and she was alone
outside cold and frightened

She avoided the village and from a sense of delicacy it left her alone
The small gaieties of the summer were on dinners dances and picnics
but her mourning made her absence inconspicuous She could not however
avoid Mrs Sayre She tried to at first but that ladys insistence and
her own apathy made it easier to accept than to refuse Then after a
time she found the house rather a refuge She seldom saw Wallie and
she found her hostess tactful kindly and uninquisitive

Take the scissors and a basket child and cut your mother some roses
she would say Or they would loot the green houses and going in the car
to the cemetery make of Jims grave a thing of beauty and remembrance

Now and then of course she saw Wallie but he never reverted to the
day she had told him of her engagement Mother and son she began to
feel that only with them could she be herself For the village her chin
high as Nina had said At home assumed cheerfulness Only at the house
on the hill could she drop her pose

She waited with a sort of desperate courage for word from Harrison
Miller What she wanted that word to be she did not know There were
of course times when she had to face the possibility that Dick had
deliberately cut himself off from her After all there had never been
any real reason why he should care for her She was not clever and not
beautiful Perhaps he had been disappointed in her and this was the
thing they were concealing Perhaps he had gone back to Wyoming and had
there found some one more worthy of im some one who understood when he
talked about the things he did in his laboratory and did not just sit
and listen with loving rather bewildered eyes

Then one night at dinner a telegram was brought in and she knew it
was the expected word She felt her mothers eyes on her and she sat
very still with her hands clenched in her lap But her father did not
read it at the table he got up and went out and some time later he
came to the door The telegram was not in sight

That was from Harrison Miller he said He has traced Dick to a hotel
at Norada but he had left the hotel and he hasnt got in touch with
him yet

He went away then and they heard the house door close

Then some days later she learned that Harrison Miller was coming home
and that David was being brought back She saw that telegram from Mr
Miller and read into it failure and discouragement and something more
ominous than either

Reach home Tuesday night Nothing definite Think safe

Think safe she asked breathlessly Then he has been in danger What
are you keeping from me And when no one spoke Oh dont you see how
cruel it is You are all trying to protect me and you are killing me
instead

Not danger her father said slowly So far as we know he is well
Is all right And seeing her face It is nothing that affects his
feeling for you dear He is thinking of you and loving you wherever he
is Only we dont know where he is

But when he came back on Tuesday after seeing Harrison Miller he was
discouraged and sick at heart He went directly upstairs to his wife
and shut the bedroom door

Not a trace he said in reply to the question in her eyes The
situation is as he outlined it in the letter He elaborated of course
The fact is and David will have to see it that that statement of his
doesnt help at all unless he can prove there is a Clifton Hines And
even then its all supposition Theres a strong sentiment out there
that Dick either killed himself or met with an accident and died in the
mountains The horse wandered into town last week Ill have to tell
her

Over this possibility they faced each other a tragic middleaged pair
helpless as is the way of middleage before the attacks of life on their
young

It will kill her Walter

Shes young he said sturdily Shell get over it

But he did not think so and she knew it

There is a rather queer element in it he observed after a time
Another man named Bassett disappeared the same night His stuff is at
the hotel but no papers to identify him He had looked after Dick that
day when he was sick and he simply vanished He didnt take the train
He was under suspicion for being with Dick and the station was being
watched But she was not interested in Bassett The name meant nothing
to her She harked back to the question that had been in both their
minds since they had read in stupefied amazement Davids statement

In a way Walter it would be better if he

Why

My little girl andJudson Clark

But he fought that sturdily They had ten years of knowledge and respect
to build on The past was past All he prayed for was Dicks return an
end to this long waiting There would be no reservations in his welcome
if only

Some time later he went downstairs to where Elizabeth sat waiting in
the library He went like a man to his execution and his resolution
nearly gave way when he saw her small in her big chair and pathetically
patient He told her the story as guardedly as he could He began with
Dicks story to him about his forgotten youth and went on carefully
to Dicks own feeling that he must clear up that past before he married
She followed him carefully bewildered a little and very tense

But why didnt he tell me

He saw it as a sort of weakness He meant to when he came back

He fought Dicks fight for him valiantly stressing certain points
that were to prepare her for others to come He plunged indeed rather
recklessly into the psychology of the situation and only got out of the
unconscious mind with an effort But behind it all was his overwhelming
desire to save her pain

You must remember he said that Dicks life before this happened
and since are two different things Whatever he did then should not
count against him now

Of course not she said Then hehad done something

Yes Something that brought him into conflict with the authorities

She did not shrink from that and he was encouraged to go on

He was young then remember Only twentyone or so And there was a
quarrel with another man The other man was shot

You mean Dick shot him

Yes You understand dont you he added anxiously that he doesnt
remember doing it

In spite of his anxiety he was forced to marvel at the sublime faith
with which she made her comment through lips that had gone white

Then it was either an accident or he deserved shooting she said But
she inquired he thought with difficulty Did he die

He could not lie to her Yes he said

She closed her eyes but a moment later she was fighting her valiant
fight again for Dick

But they let him go she protested Men do shoot in the West dont
they There must have been a reason for it You know Dick as well as I
do He couldnt do a wrong thing

He let that pass Nothing was done about it at the time he said
And Dick came here and lived his useful life among us He wouldnt have
known the mans name if he heard it But do you see sweetheart where
this is taking us He went back and they tried to get him for a thing
he didnt remember doing

Father she said and went very white Is that where he is In
prison

He tried to steady his voice

No dear He escaped into the mountains But you can understand his
silence You can understand too that he may feel he cannot come back
to us with this thing hanging over him What we have to do now is to
find him and to tell him that it makes no difference That he has his
place in the world waiting for him and that we are waiting too

When it was all over her questions and his sometimes stumbling replies
he saw that out of it all the one thing that mattered vitally to her was
that Dick was only a fugitive and not dead But she said just before
they went arm in arm up the stairs

It is queer in one way father It isnt like him to run away

He told Margaret later and she listened carefully

Then you didnt tell her about the woman in the case

Certainly not Why should I

Mrs Wheeler looked at him with the eternal surprise of woman at the
lack of masculine understanding

Because whether you think it or not she will resent and hate that as
she hates nothing else Murder will be nothing to that And she will
have to know it some time

He pondered her flat statement unhappily standing by the window and
looking out into the shaded street and a man who had been standing
cigar in mouth on a pavement across withdrew into the shadow of a tree
box

Its all a puzzle to me he said at last God alone knows how it
will turn out Harrison Miller seems to think this Bassett whoever he
is could tell us something I dont know

He drew the shade and wound his watch I dont know he repeated

Outside on the street the man with the cigar struck a match and looked
at his watch Then he walked briskly toward the railway station A half
hour later he walked into the offices of the TimesRepublican and to the
night editors desk

Hello Bassett said that gentleman We thought you were dead Well
how about the sister in California It was the Clark story wasnt it

Yes said Bassett noncommittally

And it blew up on you Well there were others who were fooled too
You had a holiday anyhow

Yes I had a holiday said Bassett and going over to his own desk
began to sort his vast accumulation of mail Sometime later he found the
night editor at his elbow

Did you get anything on the Clark business at all he asked Williams
thinks theres a page in it for Sunday anyhow Youve been on the
ground and theres a human interest element in it The last man who
talked to Clark the ranch today That sort of thing

Bassett went on doggedly sorting his mail

You take it from me he said the storys dead and so is Clark The
Donaldson woman was crazy Thats all




XXXIII

David was brought home the next day a shrivelled and aged David but
with a fighting fire in his eyes and a careful smile at the station for
the group of friends who met him

David had decided on a course and meant to follow it That course was to
protect Dicks name and to keep the place he had made in the world open
for him Not even to Lucy had he yet breathed the terror that was with
him day and night that Dick had reached the breaking point and had gone
back But he knew it was possible Lauler had warned him against shocks
and trouble and looking back David could see the gradually accumulating
pressure against that mental wall of Dicks subconscious building
overwork and Davids illness his love affair and Jim Wheelers tragedy
and coming on top of that in some way he had not yet learned the
knowledge that he was Judson Clark and a fugitive from the law The work
of ten years perhaps undone

Both David and Lucy found the homecoming painful Harrison Miller rode
up with them from the station and between him and Doctor Reynolds David
walked into his house and was assisted up the stairs At the door of
Dicks room he stopped and looked in and then went on his face set and
rigid He would not go to bed but sat in his chair while about him went
on the bustle of the return the bringing up of trunks and bags but
the careful smile was gone and his throat now so much too thin for his
collar worked convulsively

He had got Harrison Millers narrative from him on the way from the
station and it had only confirmed his suspicions

He had been in a stupor all day Miller related and was being
cared for by a man named Bassett I daresay thats the man Gregory had
referred to He may have become suspicious of Bassett I dont know But
a chambermaid recognized him as he was making his escape and raised an
alarm He got a horse out of the courtyard of the hotel and not a sign
of him has been found since

It wasnt Bassett who raised the alarm

No apparently not The odd thing is that this Bassett disappeared
too the same night I called up his paper yesterday but he hasnt
shown up

And with some small amplifications that is all there was to it

Before Harrison Miller and Doctor Reynolds left him to rest David
called Lucy in and put his plea to all of them

It is my hope he said to carry on exactly as though Dick might walk
in tomorrow and take his place again As I hold to my belief in God
so I hold to my conviction that he will come back and that before
Ibefore long But our friends will be asking where he is and what he
is doing and we would better agree on that beforehand What wed better
say is simply that Dick was called away on business connected with
some property in the West They may not believe it but theyll hardly
disprove it

So the benevolent conspiracy to protect Dick Livingstones name was
arranged and from that time on the four of them who were a party to it
turned to the outside world an unbroken front of loyalty and courage
Even to Minnie anxious and redeyed in her kitchen Lucy gave the same
explanation while she arranged Davids tray

He has been detained in the West on business Lucy said

He might have sent me a postcard And he hasnt written Doctor Reynolds
at all

He has been very busy Get the sugar bowl Minnie Hell be back soon
Im sure

But Minnie did not immediately move

Hed better come soon if he wants to see Doctor David she said with
twitching lips And Ill just say this Mrs Crosby The talk thats
going on in this town is something awful

I dont want to hear it Lucy said firmly

She ate alone painfully remembering that last gay little feast before
they started away But before she sat down she did a touching thing She
rang the bell and called Minnie

After this Minnie she said we will always set Doctor Richards
place Then when he comes

Her voice broke and Minnie scenting a tragedy but ignorant of it went
back to her kitchen to cry into the roller towel Her world was gone to
pieces By years of service to the one family she had no other world no
home no ties She was with the Livingstones but not one of them Alone
in her kitchen she felt lonely and cut off She thought that David had
he not been ill would have told her

Lucy found David moving about upstairs some time later and when she
went up she found him sitting in Dicks room on a stiff chair inside
the door She stood beside him and put her hand on his shoulder but he
did not say anything and she went away

That night David had a caller All evening the bell had been ringing
and the little card tray on the hatrack was filled with visiting cards
There were gifts too flowers and jellies and some squab from Mrs
Sayre Lucy had seen no one excusing herself on the ground of fatigue
but the man who came at nine oclock was not inclined to be turned away

You take this card up to Doctor Livingstone anyhow he said Ill
wait

He wrote in pencil on the card placing it against the door post to do
so and passed it to Minnie She calmly read it and rather defiantly
carried it off But she came down quickly touched by some contagion of
expectation from the room upstairs

Hang your hat on the rack and go on up

So it was that David and the reporter met for the first time in
Davids old fashioned chamber with its walnut bed and the dresser with
the marble top and Dicks picture in his uniform on the mantle

Bassett was shocked at the sight of David shocked and alarmed He was
uncertain at first as to the wisdom of telling his startling story to an
obviously sick man but Davids first words reassured him

Come in he said You are the Bassett who was with Doctor Livingstone
at Norada

Yes I see you know about it

We know something not everything Suddenly Davids pose deserted him
He got up and stood very straight searching eyes on his visitor Is he
living he asked in a low voice

I think so Im not certain

Then you dont know where he is

No He got awaybut you know that Sit down doctor Ive got a long
story to tell

Ill get you to call my sister first David said And tell her to
get Harrison Miller Mr Miller is our neighbor and he very kindly went
west when my health did not permit me to go

While they waited David asked only one question

The report we have had is that he was in a stupor in the hotel and the
doctor who saw himyou got him I thinksaid he appeared to have been
drinking heavily Is that true He was not a drinking man

I am quite sure he had not

There was another question in Davids mind but he did not put it He
sat with the patience of his age and his new infirmity waiting for
Lucy to bring Harrison Miller and had it not been for the trembling of
his hands Bassett would have thought him calm and even placid

During the recital that followed somewhat later David did not move He
sat silent his eyes closed his face set

Thats about all Bassett finished He had been perfectly clear in
his head all day and it took headwork to get over the pass But as I
say he had simply dropped ten years and was back to the Lucas trouble
I tried everything I knew used your name and would have used the young
ladys because sometimes that sort of thing strikes pretty deep but
I didnt know it He was convinced after a while but he was dazed of
course He knew it that is but he couldnt comprehend it

I was done up and Ive cursed myself for it since but I must have
slept like the dead I wakened once early in the night and he was
still sitting by the fire staring at it Ive forgotten to say that he
had been determined all day to go back and give himself up and the only
way I prevented it was by telling him what a blow it would be to you and
to the girl I wakened once and said to him Better get some sleep old
man He did not answer at once and then he said All right I was
dozing off when he spoke again He said Where is Beverly Carlysle now
Has she married again Shes revived The Valley and shes in New
York with it I told him

When I wakened in the morning he was gone but hed left a piece of
paper in a cleft stick beside me with directions for reaching the
railroad andwell here it is

Bassett took from his pocketbook a note and passed it over to David
who got out his spectacles with shaking hands and read it It was on
Dicks prescription paper with his name at the top and the familiar Rx
below it David read it aloud his voice husky

Many thanks for everything Bassett he read I dont like to leave
you but youll get out all right if you follow the map on the back
of this Ive had all night to think things out and Im leaving you
because you are safer without me I realize now what youve known all
day and kept from me That woman at the hotel recognized me and they
are after me

I cant make up my mind what to do Ultimately I think Ill go back and
give myself up I am a dead man anyhow to all who might have cared
but Ive got to do one or two things first and I want to think things
over One thing youve got a right to know I hated Lucas but it never
entered my head to kill him How it happened God only knows I dont

It was signed J C

Bassett broke the silence that followed the reading

I made every effort to find him I had to work alone you understand
and from the west side of the range not to arouse suspicion They were
after me too you know His horse I heard worked its way back a few
days ago Its a forsaken country and if he lost his horse he was in it
on foot and without food Of course theres a chance

His voice trailed off In the stillness David sat touching with tender
tremulous fingers what might be Dicks last message and gazing at the
picture of Dick in his uniform He knew what they all thought that Dick
was dead and that he held his final words in his hands but his militant
old spirit refused to accept that silent verdict Dick might be dead
to them but he was living He looked around the room defiantly
resentfully Of all of them he was the only one to have faith and he
was bound to a chair He knew them They would sit down supinely and
grieve while time passed and Dick fought his battle alone

No by God he would not be bound to a chair He raised himself and
stood swaying on his shaking legs

Youve given up he said scornfully You make a few days search and
then you quit Its easy to say hes dead and so you say hes dead Im
going out there myself and Ill make a search

He collapsed into the chair again and looked at them with shamed
appealing eyes Bassett was the first to break the silence speaking in
a carefully emotionless tone

I havent given up for a minute Ive given up the search because hes
beyond finding just now Either hes got away or he iswell beyond
help We have to go on the hypothesis that he got away and in that
case sooner or later youll hear from him Hes bound to remember you in
time The worst thing is this charge against him

He never killed Howard Lucas David said in a tone of conviction
Harrison read Mr Bassett my statement to you

Bassett took the statement home with him that night and studied it
carefully It explained a great deal that had puzzled him before Mrs
Wassons story and Davids arrival at the mountain cabin But most of
all it explained why the Thorwald woman had sent him after Dick She
knew then in spite of her protests to David that Jud Clark had not
killed Lucas

He paced the floor for an hour or two sunk in thought and then
unlocked a desk drawer and took out his bankbook He had saved a little
money Not much but it would carry him over if he couldnt get another
leave of absence He thought as he put the book away and prepared for
bed that it was a small price to pay for finding Clifton Hines and
saving his own soul




XXXIV

Dick had written his note and placed it where Bassett would be certain
to see it Then he found his horse and led him for the first half mile
or so of level ground before the trail began to descend He mounted
there for he knew the animal could find its way in the darkness where
he could not

He felt no weariness and no hunger although he had neither slept nor
eaten for thirtyodd hours and as contrasted with the night before his
head was clear He was able to start a train of thought and to follow it
through consecutively for the first time in hours Thought however was
easier than realization and to add to his perplexity he struggled
to place Bassett and failed entirely He remained a mysterious and
incomprehensible figure beginning and ending with the trail

Then he had an odd thought that brought him up standing He had only
Bassetts word for the story Perhaps Bassett was lying to him or mad
He rode on after a moment considering that but there was something
not in Bassetts circumstantial narrative but in himself that refused
to accept that loophole of escape He could not have told what it was

And with his increasing clarity he began to make out the case for
Bassett and against himself the unfamiliar clothing he wore the pad
with the name of Livingstone on it and the sign Rx the other contents
of his pockets

He tried to orient himself in Bassetts story A doctor The devils
irony of it Some poor hack losing sleep and bringing babies Peddling
pills Leading what Bassett had called a life of usefulness That was a
career for you a pill peddler God

But underlying all his surface thinking was still the need of flight
and he was continually confusing it with the earlier one One moment he
was looking about for the snow of that earlier escape and the next he
would remember and the sense of panic would leave him After all he
meant to surrender eventually It did not matter if they caught him

But like the sense of flight there was something else in his mind
something that he fought down and would not face When it came up
he thrust it back fiercely That something was the figure of Beverly
Carlysle stooping over her husbands body He would have died to save
her pain and yet last nightno it wasnt last night It was years and
years ago and all this time she had hated him

It was unbearable that she had gone on hating him all this time

He was very thirsty and water did not satisfy him He wanted a real
drink He wanted alcohol Suddenly he wanted all the liquor in the
world The craving came on at dawn and after that he kicked his weary
horse on recklessly so that it rocked and stumbled down the trail He
had only one thought after the frenzy seized him and that was to get to
civilization and whisky It was as though he saw in drunkenness his only
escape from the unbearable In all probability he would have killed
both his horse and himself in the grip of that sudden madness but
deliverance came in the shape of a casual rider a stranger who for a
moment took up the shuttle wove his bit of the pattern and passed
on to use his blowpipe his spirit lamp and his chemicals in some
prospectors paradise among the mountains

When Dick heard somewhere ahead the creaking of saddle leather and the
rattle of harness he drew aside on the trail and waited He had lost
all caution in the grip of his craving and all fear A line of loaded
burros rounded a point ahead and came toward him picking their way
delicately with small deliberate feet and walking on the outer edge of
the trail after the way of pack animals the world over Behind them was
a horseman rifle in the scabbard on his saddle and spurs jingling Dick
watched him with thirsty feverish eyes as he drew near He could hardly
wait to put his question

Happen to have a drink about you partner he called

The man stopped his horse and grinned

Pretty early in the morning for a drink isnt it he inquired Then
he saw Dicks eyes and reached reluctantly into his saddle bag Ive
got a quart here he said Ive traveled forty miles and spent nine
dollars to get it but I guess you need some

You wouldnt care to sell it I suppose

The bottle Not on your life

He untied a tin cup from his saddle and carefully poured a fair amount
into it steadying the horse the while

Here he said and passed it over But youd better cut it out after
this Its bad medicine Youve got two good drinks there Be careful

Dick took the cup and looked at the liquor The odor assailed him and
for a queer moment he felt a sudden distaste for it He had a revulsion
that almost shook him But he drank it down and passed the cup back

Youve traveled a long way for it he said and I needed it I guess
If youll let me pay for it

Forget it said the man amiably and started his horse But better
cut it out first chance you get Its bad medicine

He rode on after his vanishing pack and Dick took up the trail again
But before long he began to feel sick and dizzy The aftertaste of the
liquor in his mouth nauseated him The craving had been mental habit
not physical need and his body fought the poison rebelliously After
a time the sickness passed and he slept in the saddle He roused once
enough to know that the horse had left the trail and was grazing in a
green meadow Still overcome with his first real sleep he tumbled out
of the saddle and stretched himself out on the ground He slept all day
lying out in the burning sun his face upturned to the sky

When he wakened it was twilight and the horse had disappeared His face
burned from the sun and his head ached violently He was weak too
from hunger and the mornings dizziness persisted Connected thought
was impossible beyond the fact that if he did not get out soon he
would be too weak to travel Exhausted and on the verge of sunstroke he
set out on foot to find the trail

He traveled all night and the dawn found him still moving a mere
automaton of a man haggard and shambling no longer willing his
progress but somehow incredibly advancing He found water and drank it
fell got up and still right foot left foot he went on Some
time during that advance he had found a trail and he kept to it
automatically He felt no surprise and no relief when he saw a cabin in
a clearing and a woman in the doorway watching him with curious eyes
He pulled himself together and made a final effort but without much
interest in the result

I wonder if you could give me some food he said I have lost my
horse and Ive been wandering all night

I guess I can she replied not unamiably You look as though you
need it and a wash too Theres a basin and a pail of water on that
bench

But when she came out later to call him to breakfast she found him
sitting on the bench and the pail overturned on the ground

Im sorry he said dully I tried to lift it but Im about all in

Youd better come in Ive made some coffee

He could not rise He could not even raise his hands

She called her husband from where he was chopping wood off in the trees
and together they got him into the house It was days before he so much
as spoke again

So it happened that the search went on Wilkins from the east of the
range and Bassett from the west hunted at first with furious energy
then spasmodically then not at all while Dick lay in a mountain cabin
on the bed made of young trees and for the second time in his life
watched a woman moving in a leanto kitchen and was fed by a womans
hand

He forced himself to think of this small panorama of life that moved
before him rather than of himself The woman was young and pretty in a
slovenly way The man was much older and silent He was of better class
than the woman and underlying his assumption of crudity there were
occasional outcroppings of some cultural background Not then nor at
any subsequent time did he learn the story if story there was He
began to see them however not so much pioneers as refugees The cabin
was he thought a haven to the man and a prison to the woman

But they were uniformly kind to him and for weeks he stayed there
slowly readjusting In his early convalescence he would sit paring
potatoes or watching a cooking pot for her As he gained in strength
he cut a little firewood Always he sought something to keep him from
thinking

Two incidents always stood out afterwards in his memory of the cabin
One was the first time he saw himself in a mirror He knew by that time
that Bassetts story had been true and that he was ten years older than
he remembered himself to be He thought he was in a measure prepared
But he saw in the glass a man whose face was lined and whose hair was
streaked with gray The fact that his beard had grown added to the
terrible maturity of the reflection he saw and he sent the mirror
clattering to the ground

The other incident was later and when he was fairly strong again The
man was caught under a tree he was felling and badly hurt During the
hour or so that followed getting the tree cut away and moving the
injured man to the cabin on a wood sledge Dick had the feeling of
helplessness of any layman in an accident He was solicitous but clumsy
But when they had got the patient into his bed quite automatically he
found himself making an investigation and pronouncing a verdict

Later he was to realize that this was the first peak of submerged
memory rising above the flood At the time all he felt was a great
certainty He must act quickly or the man would not live And that
night with such instruments as he could extemporize he operated There
was no time to send to a town

All night after the operation Dick watched by the bedside the woman
moving back and forth restlessly He got his only knowledge of the
story such as it was then when she said once

I deserved this but he didnt I took him away from his wife

He had to stay on after that for the woman could not be left alone And
he was glad of the respite willing to drift until he got his bearings
Certain things had come back more as pictures than realities Thus
he saw David clearly Lucy dimly Elizabeth not at all But David came
first David in the buggy with the sagging springs Davids loud voice
and portly figure David steady and upright and gentle as a woman But
there was something wrong about David He puzzled over that but he was
learning not to try to force things to let them come to the surface
themselves

It was two or three days later that he remembered that David was ill
and was filled with a sickening remorse and anxiety For the first time
he made plans to get away for whatever happened after that he knew he
must see David again But all his thought led him to an impasse at that
time and that impasse was the feeling that he was a criminal and a
fugitive and that he had no right to tie up innocent lives with his
Even a letter to David might incriminate him

Coupled with his determination to surrender the idea of atonement was
strong in him An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth That had been
his fathers belief and well he remembered it But during the drifting
period he thrust it back into that painful niche where he held Beverly
and the thing he would not face

That phase of his readjustment then when he reached it was painful
and confused There was the necessity for atonement which involved
surrender and there was the call of David and the insistent desire to
see Beverly again which was the thing he would not face Of the three
the last mixed up as it was with the murder and its expiation was the
strongest For by the very freshness of his released memories it was
the days before his flight from the ranch that seemed most recent and
his life with David that was long ago and blurred in its details as by
the passing of infinite time

When Elizabeth finally came back to him it was as something very gentle
and remote out of the longforgotten past Even his image of her
was blurred and shadowy He could not hear the tones of her voice or
remember anything she had said He could never bring her at will as
he could David for instance She only came clearly at night while he
slept Then the guard was down and there crept into his dreams a small
figure infinitely loving and tender but as he roused from sleep she
changed gradually into Beverly It was Beverlys arms he felt around his
neck Nevertheless he held to Elizabeth more completely than he knew
for the one thing that emerged from his misty recollection of her was
that she cared for him In a world of hate and bitterness she cared

But she was never real to him as the other woman was real And he knew
that she was lost to him as David was lost He could never go back to
either of them

As time went on he reached the point of making practical plans He had
lost his pocketbook somewhere probably during his wanderings afoot
and he had no money He knew that the obvious course was to go to the
nearest settlement and surrender himself and he played with the thought
but even as he did so he knew that he would not do it Surrender he
would eventually but before he did that he would satisfy a craving
that was in some ways like his desire for liquor that morning on the
trail A reckless mad and irresistible impulse to see Beverly Lucas
again

In August he started for the railroad going on foot and without money
his immediate destination the harvest fields of some distant ranch his
object to earn his train fare to New York




XXXV

The summer passed slowly To David and Elizabeth it was a long waiting
but with this difference that David was kept alive by hope and that
Elizabeth felt sometimes that hope was killing her To David each day
was a new day and might hold Dick To Elizabeth after a time each day
was but one more of separation

Doctor Reynolds had become a fixture in the old house but he was not
like Dick He was a heavy silent young man shy of intruding into the
family life and already engrossed in a budding affair with the Rossiter
girl David tolerated him but with a sort of smouldering jealousy
increased by the fact that he had introduced innovations David resented
had for instance moved Dicks desk nearer the window and instead of
doing his own laboratory work had what David considered a damnably lazy
fashion of sending his little tubes carefully closed with cotton to a
hospital in town

David found the days very long and infinitely sad He wakened each
morning to renewed hope watched for the postman from his upper window
and for Lucys step on the stairs with the mail His first glimpse
of her always told him the story At the beginning he had insisted on
talking about Dick but he saw that it hurt her and of late they had
fallen into the habit of long silences

The determination to live on until that return which he never ceased
to expect only carried him so far however He felt no incentive to
activity There were times when he tried Lucy sorely when she felt
that if he would only move about go downstairs and attend to his office
practice get out into the sun and air he would grow stronger But
there were times too when she felt that only the will to live was
carrying him on

Nothing further had developed so far as they knew The search had been
abandoned Lucy was no longer so sure as she had been that the house was
under surveillance against Dicks possible return Often she lay in
her bed and faced the conviction that Dick was dead She had never
understood the talk that at first had gone on about her when Bassett
and Harrison Miller and once or twice the psychoanalyst David had
consulted in town had got together in Davids bedroom The mind was the
mind and Dick was Dick This thing about habit over which David pored
at night when he should have been sleeping or brought her in to listen
to with an air of triumphant vindication meant nothing to her

A man properly trained in right habits of thinking and of action could
not think wrong and go wrong David argued He even went further He
said that love was a habit and that love would bring Dick back to him
That he could not forget them

She believed that of course if he still lived But hadnt Mr Bassett
who seemed so curiously mixed in the affair been out again to Norada
without result No it was all over and she felt that it would be a
comfort to know where he lay and to bring him back to some wellloved
and tended grave

Elizabeth came often to see them She looked much the same as ever
although she was very slender and her smile rather strained and she
and David would have long talks together She always felt rather like an
empty vessel when she went in but David filled her with hope and sent
her away cheered and visibly brighter to her long waiting She rather
avoided Lucy for Lucys fears lay in her face and were like a shadow
over her spirit She came across her one day putting Dicks clothing
away in camphor and the act took on an air of finality that almost
crushed her

So far they had kept from her Dicks real identity but certain things
they had told her She knew that he had gone back in some strange way
to the years before he came to Haverly and that he had temporarily
forgotten everything since But they had told her too and seemed to
believe themselves that it was only temporary

At first the thought had been more than she could bear But she had to
live her life and in such a way as to hide her fears Perhaps it was
good for her the necessity of putting up a bold front to join the
conspiracy that was to hold Dicks place in the world against the hope
of his return And she still went to the Sayre house sure that there
at least there would be no curious glances no too casual questions
She could not be sure of that even at home for Nina was constantly
conjecturing

I sometimes wonder Nina began one day and stopped

Wonder what

Oh well I suppose I might as well go on Do you ever think that if
Dick had gone back as they say he has that there might be somebody
else

Another girl you mean

Yes Some one he knew before

Nina was watching her Sometimes she almost burst with the drama she
was suppressing She had been a small girl when Judson Clark had
disappeared but even at twelve she had known something of the story
She wanted frantically to go about the village and say to them Do you
know who has been living here whom you used to patronize Judson Clark
one of the richest men in the world She built day dreams on that
foundation He would come back for of course he would be found and
acquitted and buy the Sayre place perhaps or build a much larger one
and they would all go to Europe in his yacht But she knew now that the
woman Leslie had sent his flowers to had loomed large in Dicks past
and she both hated and feared her Not content with having given her
Nina some bad hours she saw the woman now possibly blocking her
ambitions for Elizabeth

What Im getting at is this she said examining her polished nails
critically If it does turn out that there was somebody youd have to
remember that it was all years and years ago and be sensible

I only want him back Elizabeth said I dont care how he comes so
he comes

Louis Bassett had become a familiar figure in the village life by that
time David depended on him with a sort of wistful confidence that
set him to grinding his teeth occasionally in a fury at his own
helplessness And as the extent of the disaster developed as he saw
David failing and Lucy ageing and when in time he met Elizabeth the
feeling of his own guilt was intensified

He spent hours studying the case and he was chiefly instrumental in
sending Harrison Miller back to Norada in September He had struck up a
friendship with Miller over their common cause and the night he was to
depart that small inner group which was fighting Davids battle for
him formed a board of strategy in Harrisons tidy livingroom Walter
Wheeler and Bassett Miller and tardily taken into their confidence
Doctor Reynolds

The same group met him on his return sat around with expectant faces
while he got out his tobacco and laid a sheaf of papers on the table
and waited while their envoy laying Bassetts map on the table
proceeded carefully to draw in a continuation of the trail beyond the
pass some sketchy mountains and a small square

Ive got something he said at last Not much but enough to work
on Heres where you lost him Bassett He pointed with his pencil
He went on for a while on the horse Then somehow he must have lost the
horse for he turned up on foot date unknown in a state of exhaustion
at a cabin that lies here I got lost myself or Id never have found
the place He was sick there for weeks and he seems to have stayed on
quite a while after he recovered as though he couldnt decide what to
do next

Walter Wheeler stirred and looked up

What sort of condition was he in when he left

Very good they said

Youre sure it was Livingstone

The man there had a tree fall on him He operated I guess thats the
answer

He considered the situation

Its the answer to more than that Reynolds said slowly It shows he
had come back to himself If he hadnt he couldnt have done it

And after that some one asked

I lost him He left to hike to the railroad and he said nothing of his
plans If Id been able to make open inquiries I might have turned
up something but I couldnt Its a hard proposition I had trouble
finding Hattie Thorwald too Shed left the hotel and is living with
her son She swears she doesnt know where Clifton Hines is and hasnt
seen him for years

Bassett had been listening intently his head dropped forward

I suppose the son doesnt know about Hines

No She warned me He was surly and suspicious The sheriff had sent
for him and questioned him about how you got his horse and I gathered
that he thought I was a detective When I told him I was a friend of
yours he sent you a message You may be able to make something out of
it I cant He said You can tell him I didnt say anything about the
other time

Bassett sat forward

The other time

He is under the impression that his mother got the horse for you once
before about ten days before Clark escaped At night also

Not for me Bassett said decisively Ten days before that I was he
got out his notebook and consulted it I was on my way to the cabin
in the mountains where the Donaldsons had hidden Jud Clark I hired a
horse at a livery stable

Could the Thorwald woman have followed you

Why the devil should she do that he asked irritably She didnt know
who I was She hadnt a chance at my papers for I kept them on me If
she did suspect I was on the case a dozen fellows had preceded me and
half of them had gone to the cabin

Nevertheless he finished I believe she did She or Hines himself
There was some one on a horse outside the cabin that night

There was silence in the room Harrison Miller thoughtfully drawing at
random on the map before him Each man was seeing the situation from his
own angle to Reynolds its medical interest and the possibility of
his permanency in the town to Walter Wheeler Elizabeths spoiled young
life to Harrison Miller David and to the reporter a conviction that
the clues he now held should lead him somewhere and did not

Before the meeting broke up Miller took a folded manuscript from the
table and passed it to Bassett

Copy of the Coroners inquiry after the murder he said Thought it
might interest you

Then for a time that was all Bassett poring at home over the inquest
records and finding them of engrossing interest saw the futility of
saving a man who could not be found And even Ninas faith that the
fabulously rich could not die obscurely began to fade as the summer
waned She restored some of her favor to Wallie Sayre and even listened
again to his alternating hopes and fears

And by the end of September he felt that he had gained real headway with
Elizabeth He had come to a point where she needed him more than she
realized where the call in her of youth for youth even in trouble was
insistent In return he felt his responsibility and responded to it In
the vernacular of the town he had settled down and the general trend
of opinion which had previously disapproved him was now that Elizabeth
might do worse

On a crisp night early in October he had brought her home from Ninas
and because the moon was full they sat for a time on the steps of the
veranda Wallie below her stirring the dead leaves on the walk with his
stick and looking up at her with boyish adoring eyes when she spoke
He was never very articulate with her and her trouble had given her a
strange new aloofness that almost frightened him But that night when
she shivered a little he reached up and touched her hand

Youre cold he said almost roughly He was sometimes rather savage
for fear he might be tender

Im not cold I think its the dead leaves

Dead leaves he repeated puzzled Youre a queer girl Elizabeth
Why dead leaves

I hate the fall Its the death of the year

Nonsense Its going to bed for a long winters nap Thats all Ill
bring you a wrap

He went in and came out in a moment with her fathers overcoat

Here he said peremptorily put this on Im not going to be called
on the carpet for giving you a sniffle

She stood up obediently and he put the big coat around her Then
obeying an irresistible impulse he caught her to him He released her
immediately however and stepped back

I love you so he stammered Im sorry Ill not do it again

She was startled but not angry

I dont like it was all she said And because she did not want him to
think she was angry she sat down again But the boy was shaken He got
out a cigarette and lighted it his hands trembling He could not think
of anything to say It was as though by that one act he had cut a bridge
behind him and on the other side lay all the platitudes the small give
and take of their hours together What to her was a regrettable incident
was to him a great dramatic climax Boylike he refused to recognize its
unimportance to her He wanted to talk about it

When you said just now that you didnt like what I did just then do
you mean you didnt like me to do it Or that you dont care for that
sort of thing Of course I know he added hastily youre not that
kind of girl I

He turned and looked at her

You know Im still in love with you dont you Elizabeth

She returned his gaze frankly

I dont see how you can be when you know what you do know

I know how you feel now But I know that people dont go on loving
hopelessly all their lives Youre young Youve gothe figured
quicklyyouve got about fiftyodd years to live yet and some of
these days youll benot forgetting he changed when he saw her quick
movement I know youll not forget him But remembering and loving are
different

I wonder she said her eyes on the moon and full of young tragedy
If they are if one can remember without loving then couldnt one love
without remembering

He stared at her

Youre too deep for me sometimes he said Im not subtle Elizabeth
I daresay Im stupid in lots of things But Im not stupid about this
Im not trying to get a promise you know I only want you to know how
things are I dont want to know why he went away or why he doesnt
come back I only want you to face the facts Id be good to you he
finished in a low tone Id spend my life thinking of ways to make you
happy

She was touched She reached down and put her hand on his shoulder

You deserve the best Wallie And youre asking for a second best Even
thatIm just not made that way I suppose Fifty years or a hundred
it would be all the same

Youd always care for him you mean

Yes Im afraid so

When he looked at her her eyes had again that faraway and yet flaming
look which he had come to associate with her thoughts of Dick She
seemed infinitely removed from him traveling her lonely road past
loving outstretched hands and facing ahead towardwell toward fifty
years of spinsterhood The sheer waste of it made him shudder

Youre cold too Wallie she said gently Youd better go home

He was about to repudiate the idea scornfully when he sneezed She got
up at once and held out her hand

You are very dear to feel about me the way you do she said rather
rapidly I appreciate your telling me And if youre chilly when you
get home youd better take some camphor

He saw her in hat in hand and then turned and stalked up the street
Camphor indeed But so stubborn was hope in his young heart that before
he had climbed the hill he was finding comfort in her thought for him

Mrs Sayre had been away for a week visiting in Michigan and he had
not expected her for a day or so To his surprise he found her on the
terrace wrapped in furs and evidently waiting for him

I wasnt enjoying it she explained when he had kissed her Its
a summer place not heated to amount to anything and when it turned
coldwhere have you been tonight

Dined at the Wards and then took Elizabeth home

How is she

Shes all right

And theres no news

He knew her very well and he saw then that she was laboring under
suppressed excitement

Whats the matter mother Youre worried about something arent you

I have something to tell you Wed better go inside He followed her
in unexcited and half smiling Her world was a small one of minor
domestic difficulties of not unfriendly gossip of occasional money
problems investments and what not He had seen her hands tremble over a
matter of a poorly served dinner So he went into the house closed the
terrace window and followed her to the library When she closed the door
he recognized her old tactics when the servants were in question

Well he inquired I suppose Then he saw her face Sorry mother
Whats the trouble

Wallie I saw Dick Livingstone in Chicago




XXXVI

During August Dick had labored in the alfalfa fields of Central
Washington a harvest hand or working stiff among other migratory
agricultural workers Among them but not entirely of them Recruited
from the lowest levels as men grade gathered in at a slave market on
the coast herded in bunk houses alive with vermin fully but badly fed
overflowing with blasphemy and filled with sullen hate for those above
them in the social scale the stiffs regarded him with distrust from
the start

In the beginning he accepted their sneers with a degree of philosophy
His physical condition was poor At night he ached intolerably
collapsing into his wooden bunk to sleep the dreamless sleep of utter
exhaustion There were times when he felt that it would be better
to return at once to Norada and surrender for that he must do so
eventually he never doubted It was as well perhaps that he had no time
for brooding but he gained sleep at the cost of superhuman exertion all
day

A feeling of unreality began to obsess him so that at times he felt
like a ghost walking among sweating men like a resurrection into life
but without life And more than once he tried to sink down to the level
of the others to unite himself again with the crowd to feel again the
touch of elbows the sensation of fellowship The primal instinct of the
herd asserted itself the need of human companionship of any sort

But he failed miserably as Jud Clark could never have failed He could
not drink with them He could not sink to their level of degradation
Their oaths and obscenity sickened and disgusted him and their talk of
women drove him into the fresh air

The fact that he could no longer drink himself into a stupor puzzled
him Bad whiskey circulated freely among the hay stacks and bunk houses
where the harvest hands were quartered and at ruinous prices The men
clubbed together to buy it and he put in his share only to find that
it not only sickened him but that he had a mental inhibition against
it

They called him the Dude and put into it gradually all the class
hatred of their wretched sullen lives He had to fight them more than
once and had they united against him he might have been killed But
they never united Their own personal animosities and angers kept them
apart as their misery held them together And as time went on and his
muscles hardened he was able to give a better account of himself The
time came when they let him alone and when one day a big shocker fell
off a stack and broke his leg and Dick set it he gained their respect
They asked no questions for their law was that the past was the past
They did not like him but in the queer twisted ethics of the camp they
judged the secret behind him by the height from which he had fallen and
began slowly to accept him as of the brotherhood of derelicts

With his improvement in his physical condition there came toward the
end of the summer a more rapid subsidence of the flood of the long
past He had slept out one night in the fields where the uncut alfalfa
was belled with purple flowers and yellow buttercups rose and nodded
above him With the first touch of dawn on the mountains he wakened to a
clarity of mind like that of the morning He felt almost an exaltation
He stood up and threw out his arms

It was all his again never to lose the old house and David and Lucy
the little laboratory the church on Sunday mornings Mike whistling
in the stable A wave of love warmed him a great surging tenderness He
would go back to them They were his and he was theirs It was at first
only a great emotion a tingling joyousness a vast relief as of one
who sees from a far distance the lights in the windows of home Save
for the gap between the drunken revel at the ranch and his awakening to
Davids face bending over him in the cabin everything was clear Still
by an effort but successfully he could unite now the two portions of
his life with only a scar between them

Not that he formulated it It was rather a mood an impulse of
unreasoning happiness The last cloud had gone the last bit of mist
from the valley He saw Haverly and the children who played in its
shaded streets Mike washing the old car and the ice cream freezer on
Sundays wrapped in sacking on the kitchen porch Jim Wheeler came back
to him the weight of his coffin dragging at his right hand as he helped
to carry it he was kneeling beside Elizabeths bed and putting his
hand over her staring eyes so she would go to sleep

The glow died away and he began to suffer intensely They were all lost
to him along with the life they represented And already he began to
look back on his period of forgetfulness with regret At least then he
had not known what he had lost

He wondered again what they knew What did they think If they believed
him dead was that not kinder than the truth Outside of David and Lucy
and of course Bassett the sole foundation on which any search for him
had rested had been the semihysterical recognition of Hattie Thorwald
But he wondered how far that search had gone

Had it extended far enough to involve David Had the hue and cry died
away or were the police still searching for him Could he even write
to David without involving him in his own trouble For David fine
wonderful old DavidDavid had deliberately obstructed the course of
justice and was an accessory after the fact

Up to that time he had drifted unable to set a course in the fog but
now he could see the way and it led him back to Norada He would not
communicate with David He would go out of the lives at the old house as
he had gone in under a lie When he surrendered it would be as Judson
Clark with his lips shut tight on the years since his escape Let them
think if they would that the curtain that had closed down over his
memory had not lifted and that he had picked up life again where he
had laid it down The police would get nothing from him to incriminate
David

But he had a moment too when surrender seemed to him not strength but
weakness where its sheer supineness its easy solution to his problem
revolted him where he clenched his fist and looked at it and longed
for the right to fight his way out

When smoke began to issue from the cookhouse chimney he stirred rose
and went back He ate no breakfast and the men seeing his squared jaw
and set face let him alone He worked with the strength of three men
that day but that night when the foreman offered him a job as pacer
with double wages he refused it

Give it to somebody else Joe he said Im quitting

The hell you are When

Id like to check out tonight

His going was without comment They had never fully accepted him and
comings and goings without notice in the camp were common He rolled up
his bedding his change of undergarments inside it and took the road
that night

The railroad was ten miles away and he made the distance easily He
walked between wire fences behind which horses moved restlessly as he
passed and cattle slept around a water hole and as he walked he faced a
situation which all day he had labored like three men to evade

He was going out of life It did not much matter whether it was to be
behind bars or to pay the ultimate price The shadow that lay over him
was that he was leaving forever David and all that he stood for and a
woman And the woman was not Elizabeth

He cursed himself in the dark for a fool and a madman he cursed the
infatuation which rose like a demoniac possession from his early life
When that failed he tried to kill it by remembering the passage of time
the loathing she must have nursed all these years He summoned the image
of Elizabeth to his aid to find it eclipsed by something infinitely
more real and vital Beverly in her dressingroom grotesque and yet
lovely in her makeup Beverly on the mountaintrail in her boyish
riding clothes Beverly

Probably at that stage of his recovery his mind had reacted more quickly
than his emotions And by that strange faculty by which an idea often
becomes stronger in memory than in its original production he found
himself in the grip of a passion infinitely more terrible than his
earlier one for her It wiped out the memory even the thought of
Elizabeth and left him a victim of its associated emotions Bitter
jealousy racked him remorse and profound grief The ten miles of road
to the railroad became ten miles of torture of increasing domination of
the impulse to go to her and of final surrender

In Spokane he outfitted himself for his clothes were ragged and with
the remainder of his money bought a ticket to Chicago Beyond Chicago he
had no thought save one Some way somehow he must get to New York
Yet all the time he was fighting He tried again and again to break
away from the emotional associations from which his memory of her was
erected when that failed he struggled to face reality the lapse of
time the certainty of his disappointment at the best the inevitable
parting when he went back to Norada But always in the end he found his
face turned toward the East and her

He had no fear of starving If he had learned the cost of a dollar in
blood and muscle he had the blood and the muscle There was a time in
Chicago when the necessity of thinking about money irritated him for
the memory of his old opulent days was very clear Times when his temper
was uncertain and he turned surly Times when his helplessness brought
to his lips the old familiar blasphemies of his youth which sounded
strange and revolting to his ears

He had no fear then but a great impatience as though having lost
so much time he must advance with every minute And Chicago drove him
frantic There came a time there when he made a deliberate attempt
to sink to the very depths to seek forgetfulness by burying one
wretchedness under another He attempted to find work and failed and he
tried to let go and sink The total result of the experiment was that
he wakened one morning in his lodginghouse ill and with his money gone
save for some small silver He thought ironically lying on his untidy
bed that even the resources of the depths were closed to him

He never tried that experiment again He hated himself for it

For days he haunted the West Madison Street employment agencies But the
agencies and sidewalks were filled with men who wandered aimlessly
with the objectless shuffle of the unemployed Beds had gone up in the
lodginghouses to thirtyfive cents a night and the food in the cheap
restaurants was almost uneatable There came a day when the free morning
coffee at a Bible Rescue Home and its soup and potatoes and carrots at
night was all he ate

For the first time his courage began to fail him He went to the
lakeside that night and stood looking at the water He meant to fight
that impulse of cowardice at the source

Up to that time he had given no thought whatever to his estate beyond
the fact that he had been undoubtedly adjudged legally dead and his
property divided But that day as he turned away from the lake front he
began to wonder about it After all since he meant to surrender himself
before long why not telegraph collect to the old offices of the estate
in New York and have them wire him money But even granting that they
were still in existence he knew with what lengthy caution following
stunned surprise they would go about investigating the message And
there were leaks in the telegraph He would have a pack of newspaper
hounds at his heels within a few hours The police too No it wouldnt
do

The next day he got a job as a taxicab driver and that night and every
night thereafter he went back to West Madison Street and picked up one
or more of the derelicts there and bought them food He developed
quite a system about it He waited until he saw a man stop outside an
eatinghouse look in and then pass on But one night he got rather
a shock For the young fellow he accosted looked at him first with
suspicion which was not unusual and later with amazement

Captain Livingstone he said and checked his hand as it was about to
rise to the salute His face broke into a smile and he whipped off his
cap Youve forgotten me sir he said But Ive got your visiting
card on the top of my head all right Can you see it

He bent his head and waited but on no immediate reply being
forthcoming for Dick was hastily determining on a course of action he
looked up It was then that he saw Dicks cheap and shabby clothes and
his grin faded

I say he said You are Livingstone arent you Id have known

I think youve made a mistake old man Dick said feeling for his
words carefully Thats not my name anyhow I thought when I saw you
staring in at that windowHow about it

The boy looked at him again and then glanced away

I was looking all right he said Ive been having a run of hard
luck

It had been Dicks custom to eat with his finds and thus remove from
the meal the quality of detached charity Men who would not take money
would join him in a meal But he could not face the lights with this
keeneyed youngster He offered him money instead

Just a lift he said awkwardly when the boy hesitated Ive been
there myself lately

But when at last he had prevailed and turned away he was conscious that
the doughboy was staring after him puzzled and unconvinced

He had a bad night after that The encounter had brought back his
hardworking carefree days in the army It had brought back too
the things he had put behind him his profession and his joy in it the
struggles and the aspirations that constitute a mans life With them
there came too a more real Elizabeth and a wave of tenderness for
her and of regret He turned on his sagging bed and deliberately put
her away from him Even if this other ghost were laid he had no right
to her

Then one day he met Mrs Sayre and saw that she knew him




XXXVII

Wallie stared at his mother His mind was at once protesting the
fact and accepting it with its consequences to himself There was
a perceptible pause before he spoke He stood if anything somewhat
straighter but that was all

Are you sure it was Livingstone

Positive I talked to him I wasnt sure myself at first He looked
shabby and thin as though hed been ill and he had the audacity to
pretend at first he didnt know me He closed the door on me and

Wait a minute mother What door

He was driving a taxicab

He looked at her incredulously

I dont believe it he said slowly I think youve made a mistake
thats all

Nonsense I know him as well as I know you

Did he acknowledge his identity

Not in so many words she admitted He said I had made a mistake and
he stuck to it Then he shut the door and drove me to the station The
only other chance I had was at the station and there was a line of
cabs behind us so I had only a second I saw he didnt intend to admit
anything so I said I can see you dont mean to recognize me Doctor
Livingstone but I must know whether I am to say at home that Ive seen
you He was making change for me at the timeId have known his hands
I think if I hadnt seen anything elseand when he looked up his face
was shocking He said Are they all right David is very ill I
said The cars behind were waiting and making a terrific din and a
traffic man ran up then and made him move on He gave me the strangest
look as he went I stood and waited thinking he would turn and come
back again at the end of the line but he didnt I almost missed my
train

Wallies first reaction to the news was one of burning anger and
condemnation

The blackguard he said The insufferable cad To have run away as
he did and then to let them believe him dead For thats what they do
believe It is killing David Livingstone and as for ElizabethShell
have to be told mother Hes alive Hes well And he has deliberately
deserted them all He ought to be shot

You didnt see him Wallie I did Hes been through something I dont
know what I didnt sleep last night for thinking of his face It had
despair in it

All right he said angrily pausing before her What do you intend to
do Let them go on as they are hoping and waiting lauding him to the
skies as a sort of superman The thing to do is to tell the truth

But we dont know the truth Wallie Theres something behind it all

Nothing very creditable be sure of that he pronounced Do you think
it is fair to Elizabeth to let her waste her life on the memory of a man
whos deserted her

It would be cruel to tell her

Youve got to be cruel to be kind sometimes he said oracularly
Why the man may be married May be anything A taxi driver Doesnt
that in itself show that hes hiding from something

She sat a small obese figure made larger by her furs and stared at him
with troubled eyes

I dont know Wallie she said helplessly In a way it might be
better to tell her She could put him out of her mind then But I hate
to do it Its like stabbing a baby

He understood her and nodded When after taking a turn or two about
the room he again stopped in front of her his angry flush had subsided

Its the devil of a mess he commented I suppose the square thing
to do is to tell Doctor David and let him decide Ive got too much at
stake to be a judge of what to do

He went upstairs soon after that leaving her still in her chair
swathed in furs her round anxious face bent forward in thought He
had rarely seen her so troubled so uncertain of her next move and he
surmised knowing her that her emotions were a complex of anxiety for
himself with Elizabeth of pity for David and of the memory of Dick
Livingstones haggard face

She sat alone for some time and then went reluctantly up the stairs to
her bedroom She felt like Wallie that she had too much at stake to
decide easily what to do

In the end she decided to ask Doctor Reynolds advice and in the
morning she proceeded to do it Reynolds was interested even a little
excited she thought but he thought it better not to tell David He
would himself go to Harrison Miller with it

You say he knew you he inquired watching her I suppose there is no
doubt of that

Certainly not Hes known me for years And he asked about David

I see He fell into profound thought while she sat in her chair a
trifle annoyed with him He was wondering how all this would affect him
and his prospects and through them his right to marry He had walked
into a good thing and into a very considerable content

I see he repeated and got up Ill tell Miller and well get to
work We are all very grateful to you Mrs Sayre

As a result of that visit Harrison Miller and Bassett went that night to
Chicago They left it to Doctor Reynolds medical judgment whether David
should be told or not and Reynolds himself did not know In the end he
passed the shuttle the next evening to Clare Rossiter

Somethings troubling you she said Youre not a bit like yourself
old dear

He looked at her To him she was all that was fine and good and sane of
judgment

Ive got something to settle he said I was wondering while you were
singing dear whether you could help me out

When I sing youre supposed to listen Well What is it She perched
herself on the arm of his chair and ran her fingers over his hair
She was very fond of him and she meant to be a good wife If she
ever thought of Dick Livingstone now it was in connection with her own
reckless confession to Elizabeth She had hated Elizabeth ever since

Ill take a hypothetical case If you guess you neednt say Of course
its a great secret

She listened nodding now and then He used no names and he said
nothing of any crime

The point is this he finished Is it better to believe the man is
dead or to know that he is alive but has cut himself off

Theres no mistake about the recognition

Somebody from the village saw him in Chicago within day or two and
talked to him

She had the whole picture in a moment She knew that Mrs Sayre had been
in Chicago that she had seen Dick there and talked to him She turned
the matter over in her mind shrewdly calculating planning her small
revenge on Elizabeth even as she talked

Id wait she advised him He may come back with them and in that
case David will know soon enough Or he may refuse to and that would
kill him Hed rather think him dead than that

She slept quietly that night and spent rather more time than usual in
dressing that morning Then she took her way to the Wheeler house She
saw in what she was doing no particularly culpable thing She had no
great revenge in mind all that she intended was an evening of the score
between them He preferred you to me when you knew I cared But he has
deserted you And perhaps too a small present jealousy for she was
to live in the old brick Livingstone house or in one like it while all
the village expected ultimately to see Elizabeth installed in the house
on the hill

She kept her message to the end of her visit and delivered her blow
standing

I have something I ought to tell you Elizabeth But I dont know how
youll take it

Maybe its something I wont want to hear

Ill tell you if you wont say where you heard it

But Elizabeth made a small impatient gesture I dont like secrets
Clare I cant keep them for one thing Youd better not tell me

Clare was nearly balked of her revenge but not entirely

All right she said and prepared to depart I wont But you might
just find out from your friend Mrs Sayre who it was she saw in Chicago
this week

It was in this manner bit by bit and each bit trivial that the case
against Dick was built up for Elizabeth Mrs Sayre helpless before her
quiet questioning had to acknowledge one damning thing after another
He had known her he had not asked for Elizabeth but only for David
he looked tired and thin but well She stood at the window watching
Elizabeth go down the hill with a feeling that she had just seen
something die before her




XXXVIII

On the night Bassett and Harrison Miller were to return from Chicago
Lucy sat downstairs in her sittingroom waiting for news

At ten oclock according to her custom she went up to see that David
was comfortable for the night and to read him that prayer for the
absent with which he always closed his day of waiting But before she
went she stopped before the old mirror in the hall to see if she wore
any visible sign of tension

The door into Dicks office was open and on his once neat desk there
lay a litter of papers and letters She sighed and went up the stairs

David lay propped up in his walnut bed An incredibly wasted and old
David the hands on the logcabin quilt which their mother had made were
old hands and tired Sometimes Lucy with a frightened gasp would fear
that Davids waiting now was not all for Dick That he was waiting for
peace

There had been something new in David lately She thought it was fear
Always he had been so sure of himself he had made his experiment in
a mans soul and whatever the result he had been ready to face his
Creator with it But he had lost courage He had tampered with the
things that were to be and not he but Dick was paying for that awful
audacity

Once picking up his prayerbook to read evening prayer as was her
custom now it had opened at a verse marked with an uneven line

I will arise and go to my Father and will say unto Him Father I
have sinned against Heaven and before Thee and am no more worthy to be
called Thy son

That had frightened her

Davids eyes followed her about the room

Ive got an idea youre keeping something from me Lucy

I Why should I do that

Then wheres Harrison he demanded querulously

She told him one of the few white lies of her life when she said He
hasnt been well Hell be over tomorrow She sat down and picked
up the prayerbook only to find him lifting himself in the bed and
listening

Somebody closed the hall door Lucy If its Reynolds I want to see
him

She got up and went to the head of the stairs The light was low in the
hall beneath and she saw a man standing there But she still wore her
reading glasses and she saw at first hardly more than a figure

Is that you Doctor Reynolds she asked in her high old voice

Then she put her hand to her throat and stood rigid staring down For
the man had whipped off his cap and stood with his arms wide looking
up

Holding to the stairrail her knees trembling under her Lucy went
down and not until Dicks arms were around her was she sure that it was
Dick and not his shabby weary ghost She clung to him tears streaming
down her face still in that cautious silence which governed them both
she held him off and looked at him and then strained herself to him
again as though the sense of unreality were too strong and only the
contact of his rough clothing made him real to her

It was not until they were in her sittingroom with the door closed that
either of them dared to speak Or perhaps could speak Even then she
kept hold of him

Dick she said Dick

And that over and over

How is he he was able to ask finally

He has been very ill I began to thinkDick Im afraid to tell him
Im afraid hell die of joy

He winced at that There could not be much joy in the farewell that was
coming Winced and almost staggered He had walked all the way from the
city and he had had no food that day

Well have to break it to him very gently he said And he mustnt
see me like this If you can find some of my clothes and Reynolds
razor Ill He caught suddenly to the back of a chair and held on to
it I havent taken time to eat much today he said smiling at her
I guess I need food Aunt Lucy

For the first time then she saw his clothes his shabbiness and
his pallor and perhaps she guessed the truth She got up her face
twitching and pushed him into a chair

You sit here she said and leave the door closed The nurse is out
for a walk and shell be in soon Ill bring some milk and cookies now
and start the fire Ive got some chops in the house

When she came back almost immediately with the familiar tray and the
familiar food he was sitting where she had left him He had spent the
entire time had she known it in impressing on his mind the familiar
details of the room to carry away with him

She stood beside him a hand on his shoulder to see that he drank the
milk slowly

Ive got the fire going she said And Ill run up now and get your
clothes Ihad put them away Her voice broke a little You see
weYou can change in your laboratory Richard cant you If you go
upstairs hell hear you

He reached up and caught her hand That touch too of the nearest to
a mothers hand that he had known he meant to carry away with him He
could not speak

She bustled away into her bright kitchen first and then with happy
stealth to the storeroom Her very heart was singing within her She
neither thought nor reasoned Dick was back and all would be well
If she had any subconscious anxieties they were quieted also
subconsciously by confidence in the men who were fighting his battle
for him by Walter Wheeler and Bassett and Harrison Miller That Dick
himself would present any difficulty lay beyond her worst fears

She had been out of the room only twenty minutes when she returned to
David and prepared to break her great news At first she thought he was
asleep He was lying back with his eyes closed and his hands crossed on
the prayerbook But he looked up at her and was instantly roused to
full attention by her face

Youve had some news he said

Yes David Theres a little news Dont count too much on it Dont
sit up David I have heard something that makes me think he is alive
Alive and well

He made a desperate effort and controlled himself

Where is he

She sat down beside him and took his hand between hers

David she said slowly God has been very good to us I want to tell
you something and I want you to prepare yourself We have heard
from Dick He is all right He loves us as he always did Andhe is
downstairs David

He lay very still and without speaking She was frightened at first
afraid to go on with her further news But suddenly David sat up in bed
and in a full firm voice began the Te Deum Laudamus We praise thee
O God we acknowledge thee to be the Lord All the earth doth worship
thee the Father everlasting

He repeated it in its entirety At the end however his voice broke

O Lord in thee have I trustedI doubted Him Lucy he said

Dick waiting at the foot of the stairs heard that triumphant paean of
thanksgiving and praise and closed his eyes

It was a few minutes later that Lucy came down the stairs again

You heard him she asked Oh Dick he had frightened me It was more
than a question of himself and you He was making it one of himself and
God

She let him go up alone and waited below straining her ears but she
heard nothing beyond Davids first hoarse cry and after a little she
went into her sittingroom and shut the door

Whatever lay underneath there was no surface drama in the meeting The
determination to ignore any tragedy in the situation was strong in
them both and if Davids eyes were blurred and his hands trembling if
Dicks first words were rather choked they hid their emotion carefully

Well here I am like a bad penny said Dick huskily from the doorway

And a long time youve been about it grumbled David You young
rascal

He held out his hand and Dick crushed it between both of his He was
startled at the change in David For a moment he could only stand there
holding his hand and trying to keep his apprehension out of his face

Sit down David said awkwardly and blew his nose with a terrific
blast Ive been laid up for a while but Im all right now Ill fool
them all yet he boasted out of his happiness and content Business
has been going to the dogs Dick Reynolds is a fool

Of course youll fool them There was still a band around Dicks
throat It hurt him to look at David so thin and feeble so sunken from
his former portliness And David saw his eyes and knew

Ive dropped a little flesh eh Dick he inquired Old bulge is
gone you see The nurse makes up the bed when Im in it flat as when
Im out

Suddenly his composure broke He was a feeble and apprehensive old man
shaken with the tearless sobbing of weakness and age Dick put an arm
across his shoulders and they sat without speech until David was quiet
again

Im a crying old woman Dick David said at last Thats what comes
of never feeling a pair of pants on your legs and being coddled like
a baby He sat up and stared around him ferociously They sprinkle
violet water on my pillows Dick Can you beat that

Warned by Lucy the nurse went to her room and did not disturb them
But she sat for a time in her rockingchair before she changed into the
nightgown and kimono in which she slept on the couch in Davids room
She knew the story and her kindly heart ached within her What good
would it do after all this homecoming Dick could not stay It was
even dangerous Reynolds had confided to her that he suspected a watch
on the house by the police and that the mail was being opened What
good was it

Across the hall she could hear Lucy moving briskly about in Dicks
room changing the bedding throwing up the windows opening and closing
bureau drawers After a time Lucy tapped at her door and she opened it

I put a cake of scented soap among your handkerchiefs she said
rather breathlessly Will you let me have it for Doctor Dicks room

She got the soap and gave it to her

He is going to stay then

Certainly he is going to stay Lucy said surprised This is his
home Where else should he go

But David knew He lay listening with avid interest to Dicks story
asking a question now and then nodding over Dicks halting attempt to
reconstruct the period of his confusion but all the time one part of
him a keen and relentless inner voice was saying Look at him well
Hold him close Listen to his voice Because this hour is yours and
perhaps only this hour

Then the Sayre woman doesnt know about your coming he asked when
Dick had finished

Still she mustnt talk about having seen you Ill send Reynolds up in
the morning

He was eager to hear of what had occurred in the long interval between
them and good bad and indifferent Dick told him But he limited
himself to events and did not touch on his mental battles and David
saw and noted it The real story he knew lay there but it was not
time for it After a while he raised himself in his bed

Call Lucy Dick

When she had come a strangely younger Lucy her withered cheeks flushed
with exercise and excitement he said

Bring me the copy of the statement I made to Harrison Miller Lucy

She brought it patted Dicks shoulder and went away David held out
the paper

Read it slowly boy he said It is my justification and God
willing it may help you The letter is from my brother Henry Read
that too

Lucy having got Dicks room in readiness sat down in it to await his
coming Downstairs in the warming oven was his supper His bed with
the best blankets was turned down and ready His dressinggown and
slippers were in their old accustomed place She drew a long breath

Below Doctor Reynolds came in quietly and stood listening The house
was very still and he decided that his news which was after all
no news could wait He went into the office and got out a sheet of
notepaper with his name at the top and began his nightly letter to
Clare Rossiter

My darling it commenced

Above David lay in his bed and Dick read the papers in his hand And as
he read them David watched him Not once since Dicks entrance had
he mentioned Elizabeth David lay still and pondered that There was
something wrong about it This was Dick their own Dick no shadowy
ghost of the past but Dick himself True an older Dick strangely
haggard and with gray running in the brown of his hair but still
Dick the Dick whose eyes had lighted at the sight of a girl who had
shamelessly persisted in holding her hand at that last dinner who had
almost idolatrously loved her

And he had not mentioned her name

When he had finished the reading Dick sat for a moment with the papers
in his hand thinking

I see he said finally Of course its possible Good God if I
could only think it

Its the answer David said stubbornly He was prowling around and
fired through the window Donaldson made the statement at the inquest
that some one had been seen on the place and that he notified you that
night after dinner Hed put guards around the place

It gives me a fighting chance anyhow Dick got up and threw back his
shoulders Thats all I want A chance to fight I know this I hated
Lucashe was a poor thing and you know what he did to me But I never
thought of killing him That wouldnt have helped matters It was too
late

What aboutthat David asked not looking at him When Dick did not
immediately reply David glanced at him to find his face set and pained

Perhaps wed better not go into that now David said hastily Its
natural that the readjustments will take time

Well have to go into it Its the hardest thing I have to face

Its not dead then

No Dick said slowly Its not dead David And Id better bring it
into the open Ive fought it to the limit by myself Its the one thing
that seems to have survived the shipwreck I cant argue it down or
think it down

Maybe if you see Elizabeth

Id break her heart thats all

He tried to make David understand He told in its sordid details his
failure to kill it his attempts to sink memory and conscience in
Chicago and their failure the continued remoteness of Elizabeth and
what seemed to him the flesh and blood reality of the other woman That
she was yesterday and Elizabeth was long ago

I cant argue it down he finished Ive tried to desperately Its
aI think its a wicked thing in a way And God knows all she ever got
out of it was suffering She must loathe the thought of me

David was compelled to let it rest there He found that Dick was
doggedly determined to see Beverly Carlysle After that he didnt know
No man wanted to surrender himself for trial unless he was sure
himself of whether he was innocent or guilty If there was a reasonable
doubtbut what did it matter one way or the other His place was gone
as hed made it gone if he was cleared gone if he was convicted

I cant come back David They wouldnt have me

After a silence he asked

How much is known here What does Elizabeth know

The town knows nothing She knows a part of it She cares a great deal
Dick Its a tragedy for her

Shall you tell her I have been here

Not unless you intend to see her

But Dick shook his head

Even if other things were the same I havent a right to see her until
Ive got a clean slate

Thats sheer evasion David said almost with irritation

Yes Dick acknowledged gravely It is sheer evasion

What about the police he inquired after a silence I was registered
at Norada I suppose they traced me

Yes The house was watched for a while I understand theyve given it
up now

In response to questions about his own condition David was almost
querulous He was all right He would get well if theyd let him and
stop coddling him He would get up now in spite of them He was good
for one more fight before he died and he intended to make it in a
court if necessary

They cant prove it Dick he said triumphantly Ive been over it
every day for months There is no case There never was a case for that
matter Theyre a lot of pinheaded fools and well show them up boy
Well show them up

But for all his excitement fatigue was telling on him Lucy tapped at
the door and came in

Youd better have your supper before it spoils she said And David
needs a rest Doctor Reynolds is in the office I havent told him yet

The two men exchanged glances

Time for that later David said I cant keep him out of my office
but I can out of my family affairs for an hour or so


So it happened that Dick followed Lucy down the back stairs and ate his
meal stealthily in the kitchen

I dont like you to eat here she protested

Ive eaten in worse places he said smiling at her And sometimes
not at all He was immediately sorry for that for the tears came to
her eyes

He broke as gently as he could the news that he could not stay but it
was a great blow to her Her sagging chin quivered piteously and it
took all the cheerfulness he could summon and all the promises of return
he could make to soften the shock

You havent even seen Elizabeth she said at last

That will have to wait until things are cleared up Aunt Lucy

Wont you write her something then Richard She looks like a ghost
these days

Her eyes were on him puzzled and wistful He met them gravely

I havent the right to see her or to write to her

And the finality in his tone closed the discussion that and something
very close to despair in his face

For all his earlier hunger he ate very little and soon after he tiptoed
up the stairs again to Davids room When he came down to the kitchen
later on he found her still there at the table where he had left her
her arms across it and her face buried in them On a chair was the
suitcase she had hastily packed for him and a roll of bills lay on the
table

You must take it she insisted It breaks my heart to thinkDick I
have the feeling that I am seeing you for the last time Then for fear
she had hurt him she forced a determined smile Dont pay any attention
to me David will tell you that I have said over and over that Id
never see you again And here you are

He was going He had said goodbye to David and was going at once She
accepted it with a stoicism born of many years of hail and farewell
kissed him tenderly let her hand linger for a moment on the rough
sleeve of his coat and then let him out by the kitchen door into the
yard But long after he had gone she stood in the doorway staring
out

In the office Doctor Reynolds was finishing a long and carefully written
letter

I am not good at putting myself on paper as you know dear heart But
this I do know I do not believe that real love dies We may bury it
so deep that it seems to be entirely dead but some day it sends up
a shoot and it either lives or the business of killing it has to be
begun all over again So when we quarrel I always know




XXXIX

The evening had shaken Dick profoundly Davids appearance and Lucys
grief and premonition most of all the talk of Elizabeth had depressed
and unnerved him Even the possibility of his own innocence was
subordinated to an overwhelming yearning for the old house and the old
life

Through a side window as he went toward the street he could see Reynolds
at his desk in the office and he was possessed by a fierce jealousy and
resentment at his presence there The laboratory window was dark and
he stood outside and looked at it He would have given his hope of
immortality just then to have been inside it once more working over his
tubes and his cultures his slides and microscope Even the memory of
certain dearlybought extravagances in apparatus revived in him
and sent the blood to his head in a wave of unreasoning anger and
bitterness

He had a wild desire to go in at the front door confront Reynolds in
his smug complacency and drive him out to demand his place in the world
and take it He could hardly tear himself away

Under a street lamp he looked at his watch It was eleven oclock and
he had a half hour to spare before traintime Following an impulse he
did not analyze he turned toward the Wheeler house Just so months ago
had he turned in that direction but with this difference that then he
went with a sort of hurried expectancy and that now he loitered on the
way Yet that it somehow drew him he knew Not with the yearning he had
felt toward the old brick house but with the poignancy of a long past
happiness He did not love but he remembered

Yet for a man who did not love he was oddly angry at the sight of two
young figures on the doorstep Their clear voices came to him across
the quiet street vibrant and full of youth It was the Sayre boy and
Elizabeth

He half stopped and looked across They were quite oblivious of him
intent and selfabsorbed As he had viewed Reynolds unconscious figure
with jealous dislike so he viewed Wallace Sayre Here everywhere his
place was filled He was angry with an unreasoning inexplicable anger
angry at Elizabeth angry at the boy and at himself

He had but to cross the street and take his place there He could
drive that beardless youngster away with a word The furious possessive
jealousy of the male animal which had nothing to do with love made him
stop and draw himself up as he stared across

Then he smiled wryly and went on He could do it but he did not want
to He would never do it Let them live their lives and let him live
his But he knew that there across the street so near that he might
have raised his voice and summoned her he was leaving the best thing
that had come into his life the one fine and good thing outside of
David and Lucy That against its loss he had nothing but an infatuation
that had ruined three lives already and was not yet finished

He stopped and turning looked back He saw the girl bend down and
put a hand on Wallie Sayres shoulder and the boys face upturned and
looking into hers He shook himself and went on After all that was
best He felt no anger now She deserved better than to be used to help
a man work out his salvation She deserved youth and joyousness and
the forgetfulness that comes with time She was already forgetting

He smiled again as he went on up the street but his hands as he
buttoned his overcoat were shaking

It was shortly after that that he met the rector Mr Oglethorpe He
passed him quickly but he was conscious that the clergyman had stopped
and was staring after him Half an hour later sitting in the empty
smoker of the train he wondered if he had not missed something there
Perhaps the church could have helped him a good mans simple belief in
right and wrong He was wandering in a gray nomans land without faith
or compass

David had given him the location of Bassetts apartment house and he
found it quickly He was in a state of nervous irritability by that
time for the sense of being a fugitive was constantly stressed in the
familiar streets by the danger of recognition It was in vain that
he argued with himself that only the police were interested in his
movements and the casual roundsman not at all He found himself shying
away from them like a nervous horse

But if he expected any surprise from Bassett he was disappointed He
greeted him as if he had seen him yesterday and explained his lack of
amazement in his first words

Doctor Livingstone telephoned me Sit down man and let me look at
you Youve given me more trouble than any human being on earth

Sorry Dick said awkwardly I seem to have a faculty of involving
other people in my difficulties

Want a drink

No thanks Ill smoke if you have any tobacco Ive been afraid to
risk a shop

Bassett talked cheerfully as he found cigarettes and matches The old
boy had a different ring to his voice tonight He was going down pretty
fast Livingstone was giving up the fight But I fancy youve given
him a new grip on the earth When they were seated however a sort of
awkwardness developed To Dick Bassett had been a more or less shadowy
memory clouded over with the details and miseries of the flight And
Bassett found Dick greatly altered He was older than he remembered him
The sort of boyishness which had come with the resurrection of his early
identity had gone and the man who sat before him was grave weary and
much older But his gaze was clear and direct

Well a good bit of water has gone over the dam since we met Bassett
said I nearly broke a leg going down that infernal mountain again
And I dont mind telling you that I came within an ace of landing in the
Norada jail They knew Id helped you get away But they couldnt prove
it

I got out because I didnt see any need of dragging you down with
me I was a good bit of a mess just then but I could reason that out
anyhow It wasnt entirely unselfish either I had a better chance
without you Or thought I did

Bassett was watching him intently

Has it all come back he inquired

Practically all Not much between the thing that happened at the ranch
and David Livingstones picking me up at the cabin

Did it ever occur to you to wonder just how I got in on your secret

I suppose you read Maggie Donaldsons confession

I came to see you before that came out

Then I dont know Im afraid

I suppose you would stake your life on the fact that Beverly Carlysle
knows nothing of what happened that night at the ranch

Dicks face twitched but he returned Bassetts gaze steadily

She has no criminal knowledge if that is what you mean

I am not so sure of it

I think youd better explain that

At the cold anger in Dicks voice Bassett stared at him So that was
how the wind lay Poor devil And out of the smug complacence of his
bachelor peace Bassett thanked his stars for no women in his life

Im afraid you misunderstand me Livingstone he said easily I dont
think that she shot Lucas But I dont think she has ever told all she
knows Ive got the coroners inquest here and well go over it
later Ill tell you how I got onto your trail Do you remember taking
Elizabeth Wheeler to see The Valley

I had forgotten it I remember now

Well Gregory the brother saw you and recognized you I was with him
He tried to deny you later but I was on Of course he told her and
I think she sent him to warn David Livingstone They knew I was on the
trail of a big story Then I think Gregory stayed here to watch me when
the company made its next jump He knew Id started for he sent David
Livingstone the letter you got By the way that letter nearly got me
jailed in Norada

Im not hiding behind her skirts Dick said shortly And theres
nothing incriminating in what you say She saw me as a fugitive and she
sent me a warning Thats all

Easy easy old man Im not pinning anything on her But I want if
you dont mind to carry this through I have every reason to believe
that some time before you got to Norada the Thorwald woman was on my
trail I know that I was followed to the cabin the night I stayed there
and that she got a saddle horse from her son that night her son by
Thorwald either for herself or some one else

All right I accept that tentatively

That means that she knew I was coming to Norada Think a minute Id
kept my movements quiet but Beverly Carlysle knew and her brother
When they warned David they warned her

I dont believe it

If you had killed Lucas Bassett asserted positively the Thorwald
woman would have let the sheriff get you and be damned to you She had
no reason to love you Youd kept her son out of what she felt was his
birthright

He got up and opened a table drawer

Ive got a copy of the coroners inquest here It will bear going over
And it may help you to remember too We neednt read it all Theres a
lot that isnt pertinent

He got out a long envelope and took from it a number of typed pages
backed with a base of heavy paper

Inquest in the Coroners office on the body of Howard Lucas he
read October 10th 1911 That was the second day after Examination
of witnesses by Coroner Samuel J Burkhardt Mrs Lucas called and
sworn He glanced at Dick and hesitated I dont know about this
tonight Livingstone You look pretty well shot to pieces

I didnt sleep last night Im all right Go on

During the reading that followed he sat back in his deep chair his
eyes closed Except that once or twice he clenched his hands he made no
movement whatever

Q What is your name

A Anne Elizabeth Lucas My stage name is Beverly Carlysle

Q Where do you live Mrs Lucas

A At 26 East 56th Street New York City

Q I shall have to ask you some questions that are necessarily painful
at this time I shall be as brief as possible Perhaps it will be
easier for you to tell so much as you know of what happened the night
before last at the Clark ranch

A I cannot tell very much I am confused too I was given a sleeping
powder last night I can only say that I heard a shot and thought at
first that it was fired from outside I ran down the stairs and back to
the billiard room As I entered the room Mr Donaldson came in through
a window My husband was lying on the floor That is all

Q Where was Judson Clark

A He was leaning on the roulette table staring at theat my husband

Q Did you see him leave the room

A No I was on my knees beside Mr Lucas I think when I got up he
was gone I didnt notice

Q Did you see a revolver

A No I didnt look for one

Q Now I shall ask you one more question and that is all Had there
been any quarrel between Mr Lucas and Mr Clark that evening in your
presence

A No But I had quarreled with them both They were drinking too
much I had gone to my room to pack and go home I was packing when I
heard the shot


Witness excused and Mr John Donaldson called

Q What is your name

A John Donaldson

Q Where do you live

A At the Clark ranch

Q What is your business

A You know all about me Im foreman of the ranch

Q I want you to tell what you know Jack about last night Begin
with where you were when you heard the shot

A I was on the side porch The billiard room opens on to it Id been
told by the corral boss earlier in the evening that hed seen a man
skulking around the house Thered been a report like that once or
twice before and I set a watch I put Ben Haggerty at the kitchen wing
with a gun and I took up a stand on the porch Before I did that I
told Judson but I dont think he took it in Hed been lit up like a
house afire all evening I asked for his gun but he said he didnt
know where it was and I went back to my house and got my own Along
about eight oclock I thought I saw some one in the shrubbery and I
went out as quietly as I could But it was a woman Hattie Thorwald who
was working at the ranch

When I left the men were playing roulette I looked in as I went back
and Judson had a gun in his hand He said I found it Jack I saw he
was very drunk and I told him to put it up Id got mine It had
occurred to me that Id better warn Haggerty to be careful and I
started along the verandah to tell him not to shoot except to scare I
had only gone a few steps when I heard a shot and ran back Mr Lucas
was on the floor dead and Judson was as the lady said He must have
gone out while I was bending over the body

Q Did you see the revolver in his hand

A No

Q How long between your warning Mr Clark and the shot

A I suppose Id gone a dozen yards

Q Were you present when the revolver was found

A No sir

Q Did you see Judson Clark again

A No sir From what I gather he went straight to the corral and got
his horse

Q You entered the room as Mrs Lucas came in the door

A Well shes wrong about that She was there a little ahead of me
Shed reached the body before I got in She was stooping over it

Bassett looked up from his reading

I want you to get this Livingstone he said How did she reach the
billiard room Where was it in the house

Off the end of the livingroom

A large livingroom

Forty or fortyfive feet about

Will you draw it for me roughly

He passed over a pad and pencil and Dick made a hasty outline Bassett
watched with growing satisfaction

Heres the point he said when Dick had finished She was there
before Donaldson or at the same time as Dick made an impatient
movement But he had only a dozen yards to go She was in her room
upstairs To get down in that time she had to leave her room descend
a staircase cross a hall and run the length of the livingroom
fortyfive feet If the case had ever gone to trial shed have had to do
some explaining

She or Donaldson Dick said obstinately

Bassett read on

Jean Melis called and sworn

Q Your name

A Jean Melis

Q Have you an American residence Mr Melis

A Only where I am employed I am now living at the Clark ranch

Q What is your business

A I am Mr Clarks valet

Q It was you who found Mr Clarks revolver

A Yes

Q Tell about how and where you found it

A I made a search early in the evening I will not hide from you that
I meant to conceal it if I discovered it A man who is drunk is not
guilty of what he does I did not find it I went back that night when
the people had gone and found it beneath the carved woodbox by the
fireplace I did not know that the sheriff had placed a man outside the
window

Get that too Bassett said putting down the paper The Frenchman
was fond of you and he was doing his blundering best But the sheriff
expected you back and had had the place watched so they caught him But
thats not the point A billiard room is a hard place to hide things in
I take it yours was like the average

Dick nodded

All right This poor boob of a valet made a search and didnt find it
Later he found it Why did he search Wasnt it the likely thing that
youd carried it away with you Do you suppose for a moment that with
Donaldson and the woman in the room you hid it there and then went back
and stood behind the roulette table leaning on it with both hands and
staring Not at all Listen to this

Q You recognize this revolver as the one you found

A Yes

Q You are familiar with it

A Yes It is Mr Clarks

Q You made the second search because you had not examined the woodbox
earlier

A No I had examined the woodbox I had a theory that

Q The Jury cannot listen to any theories This is an inquiry into
facts

Im going to find Melis the reporter said thoughtfully as he folded
up the papers The fact is I mailed an advertisement to the New York
papers today I want to get that theory of his Its the servants in
the house who know what is going on Ive got an idea that hed stumbled
onto something Hed searched for the revolver and it wasnt there
He went back and it was All that conflicting evidence and against it
what That youd run away

But he saw that Dick was very tired and even a little indifferent
He would be glad to know that his hands were clean but against the
intimation that Beverly Carlysle had known more than she had disclosed
he presented a dogged front of opposition After a time Bassett put the
papers away and essayed more general conversation and there he found
himself met half way and more He began to get Dick as a man for the
first time and as a strong man He watched his quiet lined face and
surmised behind it depths of tenderness and gentleness No wonder the
little Wheeler girl had worshipped him

It was settled that Dick was to spend the night there and such plans
as he had Bassett left until morning But while he was unfolding the
bedlounge on which Dick was to sleep Dick opened a line of discussion
that cost the reporter an hour or twos sleep before he could suppress
his irritation

I must have caused you considerable outlay one way and another he
said I want to defray that Bassett as soon as Ive figured out some
way to get at my bank account

Bassett jerked out a pillow and thumped it

Forget it Then he grinned You can fix that when you get your
estate old man Buy a newspaper and let me run it

He bent over the davenport and put the pillow in place All youll have
to do is to establish your identity The institutions that got it had to
give bond I hope youre not too long for this bed

But he looked up at Dicks silence to see him looking at him with a
faint air of amusement over his pipe

Theyre going to keep the money Bassett

Bassett straightened and stared at him

Dont be a damned fool he protested Its your money Dont tell me
youre going to give it to suffering humanity That sort of drivel makes
me sick Take it give it away if you like but for Gods sake dont
shirk your job

Dick got up and took a turn or two around the room Then after an old
habit he went to the window and stood looking out but seeing nothing

Its not that Bassett Im afraid of the accursed thing I might talk
a lot of rot about wanting to work with my hands I wouldnt if I didnt
have to any more than the next fellow I might fool myself too with
thinking I could work better without any money worries But Ive got to
remember this It took work to make a man of me before and it will take
work to keep me going the way I intend to go if I get my freedom

Sometime during the night Bassett saw that the light was still burning
by the davenport and went in Dick was asleep with a volume of Whitman
open on his chest and Bassett saw what he had been reading

You broken resolutions you racking angers you shortlived ennuis Ah
think not you shall finally triumph my real self has yet to come forth
It shall march forth overmastering till all lie beneath me It shall
stand up the soldier of unquestioned victory

Bassett took the book away and stood rereading the paragraph For the
first time he sensed the struggle going on at that time behind Dicks
quiet face and he wondered Unquestioned victory eh That was a pretty
large order




XL

Leslie Ward had found the autumn extremely tedious His old passion for
Nina now and then flamed up in him but her occasional coquetries no
longer deceived him They had their source only in her vanity She
exacted his embraces only as tribute to her own charm her youth her
fresh young body

And Nina out of her setting of gaiety of a thumping piano of
chattering giggling crowds of dancing and bridge and theater boxes
was a queen dethroned She did not read or think She spent the leisure
of her mourning period in long hours before her mirror fussing with her
hair in trimming and retrimming hats or in the fastidious care of her
hands and body

He was ashamed sometimes of his pitilessly clear analysis of her She
was not discontented save at the enforced somberness of their lives
She had found in marriage what she wanted a good house daintily
served a man to respond to her attractions as a woman and to provide
for her needs as a wife dignity and an established place in the world
liberty and privilege

But she was restless She chafed at the quiet evenings they spent at
home and resented the reading in which he took refuge from her uneasy
fidgeting

For Heavens sake Nina sit down and read or sew or do something
Youve been at that window a dozen times

Im not bothering you Go on and read

When nobody dropped in she would go upstairs and spend the hour or so
before bedtime in the rites of cold cream massage and in placing the
little combs of what Leslie had learned was called a waterwave

But her judgment was as clear as his and even more pitiless the
difference between them lay in the fact that while he rebelled she
accepted the situation She was cleverer than he was her mind worked
more quickly and she had the adaptability he lacked If there were
times when she wearied him there were others when he sickened her
Across from her at the table he ate slowly and enormously He splashed
her dainty bathroom with his loud gasping cold baths He flung his
soiled clothing anywhere He drank whisky at night and crawled into the
lavenderscented sheets redolent of it to drop into a heavy sleep and
snore until she wanted to scream But she played the game to the limit
of her ability

Then seeing that they might go on the rocks he made a valiant effort
and since she recognized it as an effort she tried to meet him half
way They played twohanded card games He read aloud to her poetry
which she loathed and she to him short stories he hated He suggested
country walks and she agreed to limp back after a half mile or so in
her highheeled pumps

He concealed his boredom from her but there were nights when he lay
awake long after she was asleep and looked ahead into a future of
unnumbered blank evenings He had formerly taken an occasional evening
at his club but on his suggesting it now Ninas eyes would fill
with suspicion and he knew that although she never mentioned Beverly
Carlysle she would neither forget nor entirely trust him again And in
his inner secret soul he knew that she was right

He had thought that he had buried that brief madness but there
were times when he knew he lied to himself One fiction however he
persisted in he had not been infatuated with Beverly It was only that
she gave him during those few days something he had not found at home
companionship and quiet intelligent talk She had been restful Nina was
never restful

He bought a New York paper daily and read it in the train The Valley
had opened to success in New York and had settled for a long run The
reviews of her work had been extraordinary and when now and then she
gave an interview he studied the photographs accompanying it But he
never carried the paper home

He began however to play with the thought of going to New York He
would not go to see her at her house but he would like to see her
before a metropolitan audience to add his mite to her triumph There
were times when he fully determined to go when he sat at his desk
with his hand on the telephone prepared to lay the foundations of
the excursion by some manipulation of business interests For months
however he never went further than the preliminary movement

But by October he began to delude himself with a real excuse for going
and this was the knowledge that by a strange chain of circumstance
this woman who so dominated his secret thoughts was connected with
Elizabeths life through Judson Clark The discovery communicated to
him by Walter Wheeler that Dick was Clark had roused in him a totally
different feeling from Ninas He saw no glamour of great wealth On the
contrary he saw in Clark the author of a great unhappiness to a woman
who had not deserved it And Nina judging him with deadly accuracy
surmised even that

That he was jealous of Judson Clark and of his part in the past
he denied to himself absolutely But his resentment took the form of
violent protest to the family against even allowing Elizabeth to have
anything to do with Dick if he turned up

Hell buy his freedom if he isnt dead he said to Nina and hell
come snivelling back here with that lost memory bunk and theyre just
fool enough to fall for it

Ive fallen for it and Im at least as intelligent as you are

Before her appraising eyes his own fell

Suppose I did something I shouldnt and turned up here with such a
story would you believe it

No When you want to do something you shouldnt you dont appear to
need any excuse

But on the whole they managed to live together comfortably enough
They each had their reservations but especially after Jims death they
tacitly agreed to stop bickering and to make their mutual concessions
What Nina never suspected was that he corresponded with Beverly
Carlysle Not that the correspondence amounted to much He had sent her
flowers the night of the New York opening with the name of his club on
his card and she wrote there in acknowledgment Then later twice
he sent her books one a biography which was a compromise with his
conscience and later a volume of exotic love verse which was not As
he replied to her notes of thanks a desultory correspondence had sprung
up letters which the world might have read and yet which had to him
the savor and interest of the clandestine

He did not know that that and not infatuation was behind his desire to
see Beverly again never reasoned that he was demonstrating to himself
that his adventurous love life was not necessarily ended never
acknowledged that the instinct of the hunter was as alive in him as
in the days before his marriage Partly then a desire for adventure
partly a hope that romance was not over but might still be waiting
around the next corner was behind his desire to see her again

Probably Nina knew that as she knew so many things why he had taken to
reading poetry for instance Certain it is that when he began early in
October to throw out small tentative remarks about the necessity of a
business trip before long to New York she narrowed her eyes She
was determined to go with him if he went at all and he was equally
determined that she should not

It became in a way a sort of watchful waiting on both sides Then
there came a time when some slight excuse offered and Leslie took up
the shuttle for fortyeight hours and wove his bit in the pattern It
happened to be on the same evening as Dicks return to the old house

He was a little too confident a trifle too easy to Nina

Has the handle of my suitcase been repaired yet he asked He was
lighting a cigarette at the time

Yes Why

Ill have to run over to New York tomorrow I wanted Joe to go alone
but he thinks he needs me Joe was his partner Oh So Joes going

Thats what I said

She was silent Joes going was clever of him It gave authenticity to
his business and it kept her at home

How long shall you be gone

Only a day or two He could not entirely keep the relief out of his
voice It had been easy incredibly easy He might have done it a month
ago And he had told the truth Joe was going

Ill pack tonight and take my suitcase in with me in the morning

If youll get your things out Ill pack them She was still thinking
but her tone was indifferent You wont want your dress clothes of
course

Id better have a dinner suit

She looked at him then with a half contemptuous smile Yes she said
slowly I suppose you will Youll be going to the theater

He glanced away

Possibly But well be rushing to get through Theres a lot to do
Amazing how business piles up when you find youre going anywhere There
wont be much time to play

She sat before the mirror in her small dressingroom that night
ostensibly preparing for bed but actually taking stock of her situation
She had done all she could had been faithful and loyal had made
his home attractive had catered to his tastes and tried to like his
friends had met his needs and responded to them And now this She was
bewildered and frightened How did women hold their husbands

She found him in bed and unmistakably asleep when she went into the
bedroom Manlike having got his way he was not troubled by doubts or
introspection It was done

He was lying on his back with his mouth open She felt a sudden and
violent repugnance to getting into the bed beside him Sometime in the
night he would turn over and throwing his arm about her hold her close
in his sleep and it would be purely automatic the mechanical result of
habit

She lay on the edge of the bed and thought things over

He had his good qualities He was kind and affectionate to her family
He had been wonderful when Jim died and he loved Elizabeth dearly He
was generous and openhanded He was handsome too in a big heavy way

She began to find excuses for him Men were always a childlike prey
to some women They were vain and especially they were sexvain good
looking men were a target for every sort of advance She transferred her
loathing of him to the woman she suspected of luring him away from her
and lay for hours hating her

She saw Leslie off in the morning with a perfunctory goodbye while cold
anger and suspicion seethed in her And later she put on her hat and
went home to lay the situation before her mother Mrs Wheeler was out
however and she found only Elizabeth sewing by her window

Nina threw her hat on the bed and sat down dispiritedly

I suppose theres no news she asked

Nina watched her She was out of patience with Elizabeth exasperated
with the world

Are you going to go on like this all your life she demanded Sitting
by a window waiting For a man who ran away from you

Thats not true and you know it

Theyre all alike Nina declared recklessly They go along well
enough and they are all for virtue and for the home and fireside stuff
until some woman comes their way I ought to know

Elizabeth looked up quickly

Why Nina she said You dont mean

He went to New York this morning He pretended to be going on business
but hes actually gone to see that actress Hes been mad about her for
months

I dont believe it

Oh wake up Nina said impatiently The world isnt made up of
good kind virtuous people Its rotten And men are all alike Dick
Livingstone and Les and all the resttarred with the same stick As
long as there are women like this Carlysle creature theyll fall for
them And you and I can sit at home and chew our nails and plan to keep
them by us And we cant do it

In spite of herself a little question of doubt crept that day into
Elizabeths mind She had always known that they had not told her all
the truth that the benevolent conspiracy to protect Dick extended even
to her But she had never thought that it might include a woman Once
there the very humility of her love for Dick was an element in favor of
the idea She had never been good enough or wise or clever enough for
him She was too small and unimportant to be really vital

Dismissing the thought did no good It came back But because she was
a healthyminded and practical person she took the one course she could
think of and put the question that night to her father when he came
back from seeing David

David had sent for him early in the evening All day he had thought
over the situation between Dick and Elizabeth with growing pain and
uneasiness He had not spoken of it to Lucy or to Harrison Miller he
knew that they would not understand and that Lucy would suffer She was
bewildered enough by Dicks departure

At noon he had insisted on getting up and being helped into his
trousers So clad he felt more of a man and better able to cope with
things although his satisfaction in them was somewhat modified by the
knowledge of two safetypins at the sides to take up their superfluous
girth at the waistband

But even the sense of being clothed as a man again did not make it
easier to say to Walter Wheeler what must be said

Walter took the news of Dicks return with a visible brightening It was
as though out of the wreckage of his middle years he saw that there
was now some salvage but he was grave and inarticulate over it wrung
Davids hand and only said

Thank God for it David And after a pause Was he all right He
remembered everything

But something strange in the situation began to obtrude itself into his
mind Dick had come back twentyfour hours ago Last night And all this
time

Where is he now

Hes not here Walter

He has gone away again without seeing Elizabeth

David cleared his throat

He is still a fugitive He doesnt himself know he isnt guilty I
think he feels that he ought not to see her until

Come come Walter Wheeler said impatiently Dont try to find
excuses for him Lets have the truth David I guess I can stand it

Poor David divided between his love for Dick and his native honesty
threw out his hands

I dont understand it Wheeler he said You and I wouldnt I
suppose We are not the sort to lose the world for a woman The plain
truth is that there is not a trace of Judson Clark in him today save
one Thats the woman

When Wheeler said nothing but sat twisting his hat in his hands David
went on It might be only a phase As its impression on Dicks youth
had been deeper than others so its effect was more lasting It might
gradually disappear He was confident indeed that it would He had
been reading on the subject all day

Walter Wheeler hardly heard him He was facing the incredible fact and
struggling with his own problem After a time he got up shook hands
with David and went home the dog at his heels

During the evening that followed he made his resolution not to tell
her never to let her suspect the truth But he began to wonder if she
had heard something for he found her eyes on him more than once and
when Margaret had gone up to bed she came over and sat on the arm of his
chair She said an odd thing then and one that made it impossible to
lie to her later

I come to you a good bit as I would go to God if he were a person
she said I have got to know something and you can tell me

He put his arm around her and held her close

Go ahead honey

Daddy do you realize that I am a woman now

I try to But it seems about six months since I was feeding you hot
water for colic

She sat still for a moment stroking his hair and being very careful not
to spoil his neat parting

You have never told me all about Dick daddy You have always kept
something back Thats true isnt it

There were details he said uncomfortably It wasnt necessary

Heres what I want to know If he has gone back to the timeyou know
wouldnt he go back to caring for the people he loved then Then
suddenly her childish appeal ceased and she slid from the chair and
stood before him I must know father I can bear it The thing you
have been keeping from me was another woman wasnt it

It was so long ago he temporized Think of it Elizabeth A boy of
twentyone or so

Then there was

I believe so at one time But I know positively that he hadnt seen or
heard from her in ten years

What sort of woman

I wouldnt think about it honey Its all so long ago

Did she live in Wyoming

She was an actress he said hard driven by her persistence

Do you know her name

Only her stage name honey

But you know she was an actress

He sighed

All right dear he said Ill tell you all I know She was an
actress and she married another man Thats all there is to it Shes
not young now She must be thirty nowif shes living he added as an
afterthought

It was some time before she spoke again

I suppose she was beautiful she said slowly

I dont know Most of them arent off the stage Anyhow what does it
matter now

Only that I know he has gone back to her And you know it too

He heard her going quietly out of the room

Long after he closed the house and went cautiously upstairs She was
waiting for him in the doorway of her room in her nightgown

I know it all now she said steadily It was because of her he shot
the other man wasnt it

She saw her answer in his startled face and closed her door quickly He
stood outside and then he tapped lightly

Let me in honey he said I want to finish it Youve got a wrong
idea about it

When she did not answer he tried the door but it was locked He turned
and went downstairs again

When he came home the next afternoon Margaret met him in the hall

She knows it Walter

Knows what

Knows he was back here and didnt see her Annie blurted it out shed
got it from the Oglethorpes laundress Mr Oglethorpe saw him on the
street

It took him some time to drag a coherent story from her Annie had
told Elizabeth in her room and then had told Margaret She had gone to
Elizabeth at once to see what she could do but Elizabeth had been in
her closet digging among her clothes She had got out her best frock
and put it on while her mother sat on the bed not even daring to broach
the matter in her mind and had gone out There was a sort of cold
determination in her that frightened Margaret She had laughed a good
bit for one thing

Shes terribly proud she finished Shell do something reckless
Im sure It wouldnt surprise me to see her come back engaged to Wallie
Sayre I think thats where she went

But apparently she had not or if she had she said nothing about it
From that time on they saw a change in her she was as loving as ever
but she affected a sort of painful brightness that was a little hard As
though she had clad herself in armor against further suffering




XLI

For months Beverly Carlysle had remained a remote and semimysterious
figure She had been in some hearts and in many minds but to most of
them she was a name only She had been the motive behind events she
never heard of the quiet center in a tornado of emotions that circled
about without touching her

On the whole she found her life with the settling down of the piece to
a successful run one of prosperous monotony She had reopened and was
living in the 56th Street house keeping a simple establishment of
cook butler and maid and in the early fall she added a town car and a
driver After that she drove out every afternoon except on matinee days
almost always alone but sometimes with a young girl from the company

She was very lonely The kaleidoscope that is theatrical New York
had altered since she left it Only one or two of her former friends
remained and she found them uninteresting and narrow with the
narrowness of their own absorbing world She had forgotten that the
theater was like an island cut off from the rest of the world having
its own politics its own society divided by caste almost its own
religion Out of its insularity it made occasional excursions to dinners
and weekends even into marriage now and then with an outlander But
almost always it went back eager for its home of dressingroom and
footlights of stage entrances up dirty alleys of doorkeepers and
managers and parts and costumes

Occasionally she had callers men she had met or who were brought to
see her She saw them over a teatable judged them remorselessly and
eliminated gradually all but one or two She watched her dignity and her
reputation with the care of an ambitious woman trying to live down the
past and she succeeded measurably well Now and then a critic spoke of
her as a second Maude Adams and those notices she kept and treasured

But she was always uneasy Never since the night he had seen Judson
Clark in the theater had they rung up without her brother having
carefully combed the house with his eyes She knew her limitations they
would have to ring down if she ever saw him over the footlights And
the season had brought its incidents to connect her with the past One
night Gregory had come back and told her Jean Melis was in the balcony

The valet was older and heavier but he had recognized him

Did he see you was her first question

Yes What about it He never saw me but once and that was at night and
out of doors

Sometimes I think I cant stand it Fred The eternal suspense the
waiting for something to happen

If anything was going to happen it would have happened months ago
Bassett has given it up And Juds dead Even Wilkins knows that

She turned on him angrily

You havent a heart have you Youre glad hes dead

Not at all As long as he kept under cover he was all right But if he
is I dont see why you should fool yourself into thinking youre sorry
Its the best solution to a number of things

What do you suppose brought Jean Melis here

What To see the best play in New York Besides why not allow the man
a healthy curiosity He was pretty closely connected with a hectic part
of your life my dear Now buck up and for the Lords sake forget the
Frenchman Hes got nothing

He saw me that night on the stairs He never took his eyes off me at
the inquest

She gave however an excellent performance that night and nothing more
was heard of the valet

There were other alarms all of them without foundation She went on her
way rejected an offer or two of marriage spent her mornings in bed and
her afternoons driving or in the hands of her hairdresser and manicure
cared for the flowers that came in long casketlike boxes and began
to feel a sense of security again She did not intend to marry or to
become interested in any one man

She had hardly given a thought to Leslie Ward He had come and gone
one of that steady procession of men mostly married who battered their
heads now and then like night beetles outside a window against the hard
glass of her ambition Because her business was to charm she had been
charming to him And could not always remember his name

As the months went by she began to accept Freds verdict that nothing
was going to happen Bassett was back and at work Either dead or a
fugitive somewhere was Judson Clark but that thought she had to keep
out of her mind Sometimes as the play went on and she was able to
make her solid investments out of it she wondered if her ten years of
retirement had been all the price she was to pay for his ruin but
she put that thought away too although she never minimized her
responsibility when she faced it

But her price had been heavy at that She was childless and alone
lavishing her aborted maternity on a brother who was living his
prosperous cheerful and not too moral life at her expense Fred was
she knew slightly drunk with success he attended to his minimum of
labor with the least possible effort had an expensive apartment on the
Drive and neglected her except when he needed money She began to see
as other women had seen before her that her success had by taking away
the necessity for initiative been extremely bad for him

That was the situation when one night late in October the trap of
Bassetts devising began to close in It had been raining but in spite
of that they had sold standing room to the fire limit Having got the
treasurers report on the nights business and sent it to Beverlys
dressingroom Gregory wandered into his small lowceiled office
under the balcony staircase and closing the door sat down It was the
interval after the second act and above the hum of voices outside the
sound of the orchestra penetrated faintly

He was entirely serene He had a supper engagement after the show
he had a neat car waiting outside to take him to it and the nights
business had been extraordinary He consulted his watch and then picked
up an evening paper A few moments later he found himself reading over
and over a small notice inserted among the personals

Personal Jean Melis who was in Norada Wyoming during the early fall
of 1911 please communicate with L 22 this office

The orchestra was still playing outside the silly giggling crowds were
moving back to their seats and somewhere Jean Melis or the friends of
Jean Melis who would tell him of it were reading that message

He got his hat and went out forgetful of the neat car at the curb of
the supper engagement of the nights business and wandered down the
street through the rain But his first uneasiness passed quickly He
saw Bassett in the affair and probably Clark himself still living
and tardily determined to clear his name But if the worst came to the
worst what could they do They could go only so far and then they
would have to quit

It would be better however if they did not see Melis Much better
there was no use involving a simple situation And Bev could be kept out
of it altogether until it was over Ashamed of his panic he went back
to the theater got a railway schedule and looked up trains He should
have done it long before he recognized have gone to Bassett in the
spring But how could he have known then that Bassett was going to make
a lifework of the case

He had only one uncertainty Suppose that Bassett had learned about
Clifton Hines

By the time the curtain rang down on the last act he was his dapper
debonair self again made his supper engagement danced half the night
and even dozed a little on the way home But he slept badly and was up
early struggling with the necessity for keeping Jean Melis out of the
way

He wondered through what formalities L 22 for instance would have
to go in order to secure a letter addressed to him Whether he had to
present a card or whether he walked in demanded his mail and went away
That thought brought another with it Wasnt it probable that Bassett
was in New York and would call for his mail himself

He determined finally to take the chance claim to be L 22 and if Melis
had seen the advertisement and replied get the letter It would be easy
to square it with the valet by saying that he had recognized him in the
theater and that Miss Carlysle wished to send him a box

He had small hope of a letter at his first call unless the Frenchman
had himself seen the notice but his anxiety drove him early to the
office There was nothing there but he learned one thing He had to
go through with no formalities The clerk merely looked in a box said
Nothing here and went on about his business At eleven oclock he
went back again and after a careful scrutiny of the crowd presented
himself once more

L 22 Here you are

He had the letter in his hand He had glanced at it and had thrust it
deep in his pocket when he felt a hand on his shoulder He wheeled and
faced Bassett

I thought I recognized that back said the reporter cheerfully Come
over here old man I want to talk to you

But he held to Gregorys shoulder In a corner Bassett dropped the
friendliness he had assumed for the clerks benefit and faced him with
cold anger

Ill have that letter now Gregory he said And Ive got a damned
good notion to lodge an information against you

I dont know what youre talking about

Forget it I was behind you when you asked for that letter Give it
here I want to show you something

Suddenly with the letter in his hand Bassett laughed and then tore it
open There was only a sheet of blank paper inside

I wasnt sure youd see it and I didnt think youd fall for it if
you did he observed But I was pretty sure you didnt want me to see
Melis Now I know it

Well I didnt Gregory said sullenly

Just the same I expect to see him The days early yet and thats
not a common name But Ill take darned good care you dont get any more
letters from here

What do you think Melis can tell you that you dont know

Ill explain that to you some day Bassett said cheerfully Some day
when you are in a more receptive mood than you are now The point at
this moment seems to me to be what does Melis know that you dont want
me to know I suppose you dont intend to tell me

Not here You may believe it or not Bassett but I was going to your
town tonight to see you

Well Bassett said sceptically Ive got your word for it And Ive
got nothing to do all day but to listen to you

To his proposition that they go to his hotel Gregory assented sullenly
and they moved out to find a taxicab On the pavement however he held
back

Ive got a right to know something he said considering what hes
done to me and mine Clarks alive I suppose

Hes alive all right

Then Ill trade you Bassett Ill come over with what I know if
youll tell me one thing What sent him into hiding for ten years and
makes him turn up now yelling for help

Bassett reflected The offer of a statement from Gregory was valuable
but on the other hand he was anxious not to influence his narrative
And Gregory saw his uncertainty He planted himself firmly on the
pavement

How about it he demanded

Ill tell you this much Gregory He never meant to bring the thing up
again In a way its me youre up against Not Clark And you can be
pretty sure I know what Im doing Ive got Clark and Ive got the
report of the coroners inquest and Ill get Melis Im going to get to
the bottom of this if I have to dig a hole that buries me

In a taxicab Gregory sat tense and erect gnawing at his blond mustache
After a time he said

What are you after in all this The story I suppose And the money I
daresay youre not doing it for love

Bassett surveyed him appraisingly

You wouldnt understand my motives if I told you As a matter of fact
he doesnt want the money

Gregory sneered

Dont kid yourself he said However as a matter of fact I dont
think hell take it It might cost too much Where is he Shooting pills
again

Youll see him in about five minutes

If the news was a surprise Gregory gave no evidence of it except to
comment

Youre a capable person arent you Ill bet you could tune a piano if
you were put to it

He carried the situation well the reporter had to admit the only
evidence he gave of strain was that the hands with which he lighted a
cigarette were unsteady He surveyed the obscure hotel at which the cab
stopped with a sneering smile and settled his collar as he looked it
over

Not advertising to the world that youre in town I see

Well do that just as soon as were ready Dont worry

The laugh he gave at that struck unpleasantly on Bassetts ears But
inside the building he lost some of his jauntiness Queer place to find
Judson Clark he said once

And again

Youd better watch him when I go in He may bite me

To which Bassett grimly returned Hes probably rather particular what
he bites

He was uneasily conscious that Gregory while nervous and tense was
carrying the situation with a certain assurance If he was acting it was
very good acting And that opinion was strengthened when he threw open
the door and Gregory advanced into the room

Well Clark he said coolly I guess you didnt expect to see me
did you

He made no offer to shake hands as Dick turned from the window nor
did Dick make any overtures But there was no enmity at first in either
face Gregory was easy and assured Dick grave and Bassett thought
slightly impatient From that night in his apartment the reporter had
realized that he was constantly fighting a sort of passive resistance in
Dick a determination not at any cost to involve Beverly Behind that
too he felt that still another battle was going on one at which he
could only guess but which made Dick somber at times and grimly quiet
always

I meant to look you up was his reply to Gregorys nonchalant
greeting

Well your friend here did that for you Gregory said and smiled
across at Bassett He has his own methods and Ill say theyre
effectual

He took off his overcoat and flung it on the bed and threw a swift
appraising glance at Dick It was on Dick that he was banking not on
Bassett He hated and feared Bassett He hated Dick but he was not
afraid of him He lighted a cigarette and faced Dick with a malicious
smile

So here we are again Jud he said But with this change that
now its you who are the respectable member of the community and Im
thewell well call it the butterfly

There was unmistakable insult in his tone and Dick caught it

Then I take it youre still living off your sister

The contempt in Dicks voice whipped the color to Gregorys face and
clenched his fist But he relaxed in a moment and laughed

Dont worry Bassett he said his eyes on Dick We havent any
reason to like each other but hes bigger than I am I wont hit him
Then he hardened his voice But Ill remind you Clark that personally
I dont give a Goddamn whether you swing or not Also that I can keep
my mouth shut walk out of here and have you in quod in the next hour
if I decide to

But you wont Bassett said smoothly You wont any more than you
did it last spring when you sent that little letter of yours to David
Livingstone

No Youre right I wont But if I tell you what I came here to say
Bassett get this straight Its not because Im afraid of you or of
him Donaldsons dead What value would Meliss testimony have after ten
years if you put him on the stand Its not that Its because youll
put your blundering foot into it and ruin Bevs career unless I tell
you the truth

It was to Bassett then that he told his story he and Bassett sitting
Dick standing with his elbow on the mantelpiece tall and weary and
almost detached

Ive got to make my own position plain in this he said I didnt
like Clark and I kept her from marrying him There was one time before
she met Lucas when she almost did it I was away when she decided on
that fool trip to the Clark ranch We couldnt get a New York theater
until November and she had some time so they went Ive got her story
of what happened there You can check it up with what you know

He turned to Dick for a moment

You were drinking pretty hard that night but you may remember this
She had quarreled with Lucas at dinner that night and with you Thats
true isnt it

Yes

She went to her room and began to pack her things Then she thought
it over and she decided to try to persuade Lucas to go too Things had
begun all right but they were getting strained and unpleasant She went
down the stairs and Melis saw her the valet The livingroom was dark
but there was a light coming through the billiard room door and against
it she saw the figure of a man in the doorway He had his back to her
and he had a revolver in his hand She ran across the room when he
heard her and when he turned she saw it was Lucas Do you remember Jud
having a revolver and Lucas taking it from you

No Donaldson testified Id had a revolver

Well thats how we figure hed got the gun She thought at once that
Lucas and you had quarreled and that he was going to shoot She tried
to take it from him but he was drunk and stubborn It went off and
killed him

Bassett leaned forward

Thats straight is it

Im telling you

Then why in Gods name didnt she say that at the inquest

She was afraid it wouldnt be believed Look at the facts Shed
quarreled with Lucas There had been a notorious situation with regard
to Clark And remember this She had done it I know her well enough
however to say that she would have confessed eventually but Clark
had beaten it It was reasonably sure that he was lost in the blizzard
Youve got to allow for that

Bassett said nothing After a silence Dick spoke

What about the revolver

She had it in her hand She dropped it and stood still too stunned to
scream Lucas she says took a step or two forward and fell through
the doorway Donaldson came running in and you know the rest

Bassett was the first to break the silence

She will be willing to testify to that now of course

And stand trial

Not necessarily Clark would be on trial Hes been indicted He has to
be tried

Why does he have to be tried Hes free now Hes been free for ten
years And I tell you as an honest opinion that the thing would kill
her Accident and all she did it And there would be some whod never
believe she hadnt tired of Lucas and wanted the Clark money

Thats a chance shell have to take Bassett said doggedly The only
living witness who could be called would be the valet And remember
this for ten years he has believed that she did it Hell have built up
a story by this time perhaps unconsciously that might damn her

Dick moved

Theres only one thing to do Youre right Gregory Ill never expose
her to that

Youre crazy Bassett said angrily

Not at all I told you I wouldnt hide behind a woman As a matter of
fact Ive learned what I wanted Lucas wasnt murdered I didnt shoot
him Thats what really matters Im no worse off than I was before
considerably better in fact And I dont see whats to be gained by
going any further

In spite of his protests Bassett was compelled finally to agree He was
sulky and dispirited He saw the profound anticlimax to all his effort
of Dick wandering out again legally dead and legally guilty and he
swore roundly under his breath

All right he grunted at last I guess thats the last word Gregory
But you tell her from me that if she doesnt reopen the matter of her
own accord shell have a mans life on her conscience

Ill not tell her anything about it Im not only her brother Im her
manager now And Im not kicking any hole in the boat that floats me

He was selfconfident and slightly insolent the hands with which he
lighted a fresh cigarette no longer trembled and the glance he threw at
Dick was triumphant and hostile

As a man sows Clark he said You sowed hell for a number of people
once

Bassett had to restrain an impulse to kick him out of the door When he
had gone Bassett turned to Dick with assumed lightness

Well he said here we are all dressed up and nowhere to go

He wandered around the room restless and disappointed He knew and
Dick knew that they had come to the end of the road and that nothing
lay beyond In his own unpleasant way Fred Gregory had made a case for
his sister that tied their hands and the crux of the matter had lain
in his final gibe As a man sows Clark so shall he reap The moral
issue was there


I suppose the Hines story goes by the board eh he commented after a
pause

Yes Except that I wish Id known about him when I could have done
something Hes my halfbrother any way you look at it and he had a
rotten deal Sometimes a man sows he added with a wry smile and the
other fellow reaps

Bassett went out after that going to the office on the chance of a
letter from Melis but there was none When he came back he found Dick
standing over a partially packed suitcase and knew that they had come
to the end of the road indeed

Whats the next step he asked bluntly

Ill have to leave here Its too expensive

And after that what

Ill get a job I suppose a man is as well hidden here as anywhere I
can grow a beardthats the usual thing isnt it

Bassett made an impatient gesture and fell to pacing the floor Its
incredible he said Its monstrous Its a joke Here you are
without a thing against you and hung like Mahomets coffin between
heaven and earth It makes me sick

He went home that night leaving word to have any letters for L 22
forwarded but without much hope His last clutch of Dicks hand had a
sort of desperate finality in it and he carried with him most of the
way home the tall worn and rather shabby figure that saw him off with a
smile

By the next afternoons mail he received a note from New York with a
few words of comment penciled on it in Dicks writing This came this
evening I sent back the money D The note was from Gregory and
had evidently enclosed a onehundred dollar bill It began without
superscription Enclosed find a hundred dollars as I imagine funds may
be short If I were you Id get out of here There has been considerable
excitement and you know too many people in this burg

Bassett sat back in his chair and studied the note

Now why the devil did he do that he reflected He sat for some time
thinking deeply and he came to one important conclusion The story
Gregory had told was the one which was absolutely calculated to shut
off all further inquiry They had had ten years ten years to plan
eliminate and construct ten years to prepare their defense in case
Clark turned up Wasnt that why Gregory had been so assured But he had
not been content to let well enough alone he had perhaps overreached
himself

Then what was the answer She had killed Lucas but was it an accident
And there must have been a witness or they would have had nothing to
fear He wrote out on a bit of paper three names and sat looking at
them

Hattie Thorwald Jean Melis Clifton Hines




XLII

Elizabeth had quite definitely put Dick out of her heart On the evening
of the day she learned he had come back and had not seen her she
deliberately killed her love and decently interred it She burned her
notes and his one letter and put away her ring performing the rites not
as rites but as a shameful business to be done with quickly She tore
his photograph into bits and threw them into her waste basket and
having thus housecleaned her room set to work to houseclean her heart

She found very little to do She was numb and totally without feeling
The little painful constriction in her chest which had so often come
lately with her thoughts of him was gone She felt extraordinarily
empty but not light and her feet dragged about the room

She felt no sense of Dicks unworthiness but simply that she was up
against something she could not fight and no longer wanted to fight
She was beaten but the strange thing was that she did not care Only
she would not be pitied As the days went on she resented the pity that
had kept her in ignorance for so long and had let her wear her heart on
her sleeve and she even wondered sometimes whether the story of Dicks
loss of memory had not been false evolved out of that pity and the
desire to save her pain

David sent for her but she wrote him a little note formal and
restrained She would come in a day or two but now she must get her
bearings He was to know that she was not angry and felt it all for
the best and she was very lovingly his Elizabeth

She knew now that she would eventually marry Wallie Sayre if only to get
away from pity He would have to know the truth about her that she did
not love any one not even her father and her mother She pretended to
care for fear of hurting them but she was actually frozen quite hard
She did not believe in love It was a terrible thing to be avoided
by any one who wanted to get along and this avoiding was really quite
simple One simply stopped feeling

On the Sunday after she had come to this comfortable knowledge she sat
in the church as usual in the choir stalls and suddenly she hated the
church She hated the way the larynx of Henry Wallace the tenor stuck
out like a crabapple over his low collar She hated the fat double chin
of the bass She hated the talk about love and the certain rewards of
virtue and the faces of the congregation smug and sure of salvation

She went to the choir master after the service to hand in her
resignation And did not because it had occurred to her that it might
look to use Ninas word as though she were crushed Crushed That was
funny

Wallie Sayre was waiting for her outside and she went up with him to
lunch and afterwards they played golf They had rather an amusing game
and once she had to sit down on a bunker and laugh until she was weak
while he fought his way out of a pit Crushed indeed

So the weaving went on almost completed now With Wallie Sayre biding
his time but fairly sure of the result With Jean Melis happening on
a twodays old paper and reading over and over a notice addressed to
him With Leslie Ward neither better nor worse than his kind seeking
adventure in a bypath which was East 56th Street And with Dick
wandering the streets of New York after twilight and standing once with
his coat collar turned up against the rain outside of the Metropolitan
Club where the great painting of his father hung over a mantelpiece

Now that he was near Beverly Dick hesitated to see her He felt no
resentment at her long silence nor at his exile which had resulted
from it He made excuses for her recognized his own contribution to
the catastrophe knew too that nothing was to be gained by seeing her
again But he determined finally to see her once more and then to go
away leaving her to peace and to success

She would know now that she had nothing to fear from him All he wanted
was to satisfy the hunger that was in him by seeing her and then to go
away

Curiously that hunger to see her had been in abeyance while Bassett
was with him It was only when he was alone again that it came up and
although he knew that he was unconscious of another fact that every
word every picture of her on the great boardings which walled in every
empty lot everything indeed which brought her into the reality of the
present loosened by so much her hold on him out of the past

When he finally went to the 56th Street house it was on impulse He had
meant to pass it but he found himself stopping and half angrily made
his determination He would follow the cursed thing through now and get
it over Perhaps he had discounted it too much in advance waited too
long hoped too much Perhaps it was simply that that last phase was
already passing But he felt no thrill no expectancy as he rang the
bell and was admitted to the familiar hall

It was peopled with ghosts for him Upstairs in the drawingroom
that extended across the front of the house she had told him of her
engagement to Howard Lucas Later on coming back from Europe he had
gone back there to find Lucas installed in the house his cigars on
the table his photographs on the piano his books scattered about
And Lucas himself smiling handsome and triumphant on the hearth rug
dressed for dinner except for a brocaded dressinggown putting his hand
familiarly on Beverlys shoulder and calling her old girl

He wandered into the small room to the right of the hall where in other
days he had waited to be taken upstairs and stood looking out of the
window He heard some one a caller come down get into his overcoat
in the hall and go out but he was not interested He did not know
that Leslie Ward had stood outside the door for a minute had seen and
recognized him and had then slammed out

He was quite steady as the butler preceded him up the stairs He even
noticed certain changes in the house the door at the landing converted
into an arch leaded glass in the diningroom windows beyond it But
he caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror and saw himself a shabby
contrast to the former days

He faced her still with that unexpected composure and he saw her very
little changed Even the movement with which she came toward him with
both hands out was familiar

Jud she said Oh my dear

He saw that she was profoundly moved and suddenly he was sorry for her
Sorry for the years behind them both for the burden she had carried
for the tears in her eyes

Dear old Bev he said

She put her head against his shoulder and cried unrestrainedly and
he held her there saying small gentle soothing things smoothing her
hair But all the time he knew that life had been playing him another
trick he felt a great tenderness for her and profound pity but he
did not love her or want her He saw that after all the suffering
and waiting the death and exile he was left at the end with nothing
Nothing at all

When she was restored to a sort of tense composure he found to his
discomfort that womanlike she intended to abase herself thoroughly and
completely She implored his forgiveness for his long exile gazing at
him humbly and when he said in a matteroffact tone that he had been
happy giving him a look which showed that she thought he was lying to
save her unhappiness

You are trying to make it easier for me But I know Jud

Im telling you the truth he said patiently Theres one point I
didnt think necessary to tell your brother For a good while I didnt
remember anything about it If it hadnt been for thatwell I dont
know Anyhow dont look at me as though I willfully saved you I
didnt

She sat still pondering that and twisting a ring on her finger

What do you mean to do she asked after a pause

I dont know Ill find something

You wont go back to your work

I dont see how I can Im in hiding in a sort of casual fashion

To his intense discomfiture she began to cry again She couldnt go
through with it She would go back to Norada and tell the whole thing
She had let Fred influence her but she saw now she couldnt do it But
for the first time he felt that in this one thing she was not sincere
Her grief and abasement had been real enough but now he felt she was
acting

Suppose we dont go into that now he said gently Youve had about
all you can stand He got up awkwardly I suppose you are playing
tonight

She nodded looking up at him dumbly

Better lie down then andforget me He smiled down at her

Ive never forgotten you Jud And now seeing you againI

Her face worked She continued to look up at him piteously The
appalling truth came to him then and that part of him which had
remained detached and aloof watching almost smiled at the irony She
cared for him Out of her memories she had built up something to care
for something no more himself than she was the woman of his dreams but
with this difference that she was clinging womanfashion to the thing
she had built and he had watched it crumble before his eyes

Will you promise to go and rest

Yes If you say so

She was acquiescent and humble Her eyes were soft faithful childlike

Ive suffered so Jud

I know

You dont hate me do you

Why should I Just remember this while you were carrying this burden
I was happier than Id ever been Ill tell you about it some time

She got up and he perceived that she expected him again to take her in
his arms He felt ridiculous and resentful and rather as though he was
expected to kiss the hand that had beaten him but when she came close
to him he put an arm around her shoulders

Poor Bev he said Weve made pretty much a mess of it havent we

He patted her and let her go and her eyes followed him as he left the
room The elder brotherliness of that embrace had told her the truth as
he could never have hurt her in words She went back to the chair where
he had sat and leaned her cheek against it

After a time she went slowly upstairs and into her room When her maid
came in she found her before the mirror of her dressingtable staring
at her reflection with hard appraising eyes

Leslies partner wandering into the hotel at six oclock found from
the disordered condition of the room that Leslie had been back had
apparently bathed shaved and made a careful toilet and gone out again
Joe found himself unexpectedly at a loose end Filled with suppressed
indignation he commenced to dress getting out a shirt hunting his
evening studs and lining up what he meant to say to Leslie over his
defection

Then at a quarter to seven Leslie came in tophatted and
morningcoated with a yellowing gardenia in his buttonhole and his
shoes covered with dust

Hello Les Joe said glancing up from a laborious struggle with a
stud Been to a wedding

Why

You look like it

I made a call and since then Ive been walking

Some walk Id say Joe observed looking at him shrewdly Whats
wrong Les Fair one turn you down

Go to hell Leslie said irritably

He flung off his coat and jerked at his tie Then with it hanging
loose he turned to Joe

Im going to tell you something I know its safe with you and I need
some advice I called on a woman this afternoon You know who she is
Beverly Carlysle

Joe whistled softly

Thats not the point Leslie declaimed in a truculent voice Im not
defending myself Shes a friend Ive got a right to call there if I
want to

Sure you have soothed Joe

Well you know the situation at home and who Livingstone actually is
The point is that while that poor kid at home is sitting around killing
herself with grief Clarks gone back to her To Beverly Carlysle

How do you know

Know I saw him this afternoon at her house

He sat still moodily reviewing the situation His thoughts were a
chaotic and unpleasant mixture of jealousy fear of Nina anxiety over
Elizabeth and the sense of a lost romantic adventure After a while he
got up

Shes a nice kid he said Im fond of her And I dont know what to
do

Suddenly Joe grinned

I see he said And you cant tell her or the family where you saw
him

Not without raising the deuce of a row

He began automatically to dress for dinner Joe moved around the room
rang for a waiter ordered orange juice and ice and produced a bottle
of gin from his bag Leslie did not hear him nor the later preparation
of the cocktails He was reflecting bitterly on the fact that a man who
married built himself a wall against romance a wall compounded of his
own new sense of responsibility of family ties and fear

Joe brought him a cocktail

Drink it old dear he said And when its down Ill tell you a few
little things about playing around with ladies who have a past Heres
to forgetting em

Leslie took the glass

Righto he said

He went home the following day leaving Joe to finish the business in
New York His going rather resembled a flight Tossing sleepless the
night before he had found what many a man had discovered before him
that his love of clandestine adventure was not as strong as his caution
He had had a shock True his affair with Beverly had been a formless
thing a matter of imagination and a desire to assure himself that
romance for him was not yet dead True too that he had nothing to
fear from Dick Livingstone But the encounter had brought home to him
the danger of this oldnew game he was playing He was running like a
frightened child

He thought of various plans One of them was to tell Nina the truth
take his medicine of tears and coldness and then go to Mr Wheeler
One was to go to Mr Wheeler without Nina and make his humiliating
admission But Walter Wheeler had his own rigid ideas was
uncompromising in rectitude and would understand as only a man could
that while so far he had been only mentally unfaithful he had been
actuated by at least subconscious desire

His own awareness of that fact made him more cautious than he need have
been perhaps more selfconscious And he genuinely cared for Elizabeth
It was on the whole a generous and kindly impulse that lay behind his
ultimate resolution to tell her that her desertion was both wilful and
cruel

Yet when the time came he found it hard to tell her He took her for
a drive one evening soon after his return forcibly driving off Wallie
Sayre to do so and eying surreptitiously now and then her pale rather
set face He found a quiet lane and stopped the car there and then
turned and faced her

Howve you been little sister while Ive been wandering the gay white
way he asked

Ive been all right Leslie

Not quite all right I think Have you ever thought Elizabeth that no
man on earth is worth what youve been going through

Im all right I tell you she said impatiently Im not grieving any
more Thats the truth Les I know now that he doesnt intend to come
back and I dont care I never even think about him now

I see he said Well thats that

But he had not counted on her intuition and was startled to hear her
say

Well Go on

What do you mean go on

You brought me out here to tell me something

Not at all I simply

Where is he Youve seen him

He tried to meet her eyes failed cursed himself for a fool Hes
alive and well Elizabeth I saw him in New York It was a full minute
before she spoke again and then her lips were stiff and her voice
strained

Has he gone back to her To the actress he used to care for

He hesitated but he knew he would have to go on

Im going to tell you something Elizabeth Its not very creditable
to me but Ill have to trust you I dont want to see you wasting your
life Youve got plenty of courage and a lot of spirit And youve got
to forget him

He told her and then he took her home He was a little frightened for
there was something not like her in the way she had taken it a sort of
immobility that might he thought cover heartbreak But she smiled when
she thanked him and went very calmly into the house

That night she accepted Wallie Sayre




XLIII

Bassett was having a visitor He sat in his chair while that visitor
ranged excitedly up and down the room a short stout man well dressed
and with a mixture of servility and importance The valets first words
as he stood inside the door had been significant

I should like to know first if I am talking to the police

Noand yes Bassett said genially Come and sit down man What I
mean is this I am a friend of Judson Clarks and this may or may not
be a police matter I dont know yet

You are a friend of Mr Clarks Then the report was correct He is
still alive sir

Yes

The valet got out a handkerchief and wiped his face He was clearly
moved

I am glad of that Very glad I saw some months ago in a
newspaperwhere is he

In New York Now Melis Ive an idea that you know something about the
crime Judson Clark was accused of You intimated that at the inquest

Mrs Lucas killed him

So she says Bassett said easily

The valet jumped and stared

She admits it as the result of an accident She also admits hiding the
revolver where you found it

Then you do not need me

Im not so sure of that

The valet was puzzled

I want you to think back Melis You saw her go down the stairs
sometime before the shot Later you were confident she had hidden the
revolver and you made a second search for it Why You hadnt heard her
testimony at the inquest then Clark had run away Why didnt you think
Clark had done it

Because I thought she was having an affair with another man I have
always thought she did it

Bassett nodded

I thought so What made you think that

Ill tell you She went West without a maid and Mr Clark got a
Swedish woman from a ranch near to look after her a woman named
Thorwald She lived at her own place and came over every day One night
after Mrs Thorwald had started home I came across her down the road
near the irrigators house and there was a man with her They didnt
hear me behind them and he was giving her a note for some one in the
house

Why not for one of the servants

Thats what I thought then sir It wasnt my business But I saw the
same man later on hanging about the place at night and once I saw
her with himMrs Lucas I mean That was in the early evening The
gentlemen were out riding and Id gone with one of the maids to a hill
to watch the moon rise They were on some rocks below in the canyon

Did you see him

I think it was the same man if thats what you mean I knew something
queer was going on after that and I watched her She went out at night
more than once Then I told Donaldson there was somebody hanging round
the place and he set a watch

Fine Now well go to the night Lucas was shot Was the Thorwald woman
there

She had started home

Leaving Mrs Lucas packing alone

Yes I hadnt thought of that The Thorwald woman heard the shot and
came back I remember that because she fainted upstairs and I had to
carry her to a bed

I see Now about the revolver

I located it the first time I looked for it Donaldson and the others
had searched the billiard room So I tried the big room It was under
a chair I left it there and concealed myself in the room She Mrs
Lucas came down late that night and hunted for it Then she hid it
where I got it later

I wish I knew Melis why you didnt bring those facts out at the
inquest

You must remember this sir I had been with Mr Clark for a long time
I knew the situation And I thought that he had gone away that night
to throw suspicion from her to himself I was not certain what to do I
would have told it all in court but it never came to trial

Bassett was satisfied and fairly content After the Frenchmans
departure he sat for some time making careful notes and studying them
Supposing the man Melis had seen to be Clifton Hines a good many things
would be cleared up Some new element he had to have if Gregorys
story were to be disproved some new and different motive Suppose for
instance

He got up and paced the floor back and forward forward and back There
was just one possibility and just one way of verifying it He sat down
and wrote out a long telegram and then got his hat and carried it to the
telegraph office himself He had made his last throw

He received a reply the following day and in a state of exhilaration
bordering on madness packed his bag and as he packed it addressed it
after the fashion of lonely men the world over

Just one more trip friend cowhide he said and then you and I
are going to settle down again to work But its some trip old
armbreaker

He put in his pajamas and handkerchiefs his clean socks and collars
and then he got his revolver from a drawer and added it Just
twentyfour hours later he knocked at Dicks door in a boardinghouse on
West Ninth Street found it unlocked and went in Dick was asleep
and Bassett stood looking down at him with an odd sort of paternal
affection Finally he bent down and touched his shoulder

Wake up old top he said Wake up I have some news for you




XLIV

To Dick the last day or two had been nightmares of loneliness He threw
caution to the winds and walked hour after hour only to find that
the street crowds people who had left a home or were going to one
depressed him and emphasized his isolation He had deliberately put
away from him the anchor that had been Elizabeth and had followed a
treacherous memory and now he was adrift He told himself that he did
not want much Only peace work and a place But he had not one of them

He was homesick for David for Lucy and with a tightening of the
heart he admitted it for Elizabeth And he had no home He thought of
Reynolds bent over the desk in his office he saw the quiet treeshaded
streets of the town and Reynolds passing from house to house in the
little town doing his work usurping his place in the confidence and
friendship of the people he saw the very children named for him asking
Who was I named for mother He saw David and Lucy gone and the
old house abandoned or perhaps echoing to the laughter of Reynolds
children

He had moments when he wondered what would happen if he took Beverly at
her word Suppose she made her confession reopened the thing to fill
the papers with great headlines Judson Clark Not Guilty A Strange
Story

He saw himself going back to the curious glances of the town never to
be to them the same as before To face them and look them down to hear
whispers behind his back to feel himself watched and judged on that
far past of his Suppose even that it could be kept out of the papers
Wilkins amiable and acquiescent Beverlys confession hidden in the ruck
of legal documents and he stealing back to go on as best he could
covering his absence with lies and taking up his work again But even
that uneasy road was closed to him He saw David and Lucy stooping to
new and strange hypocrisies watching with anxious old eyes the faces of
their neighbors growing defiant and hard as time went on and suspicion
still followed him

And there was Elizabeth

He tried not to think of her save as of some fine and tender thing he
had once brushed as he passed by Even if she still cared for him he
could even less than David and Lucy ask her to walk the uneasy road
with him She was young She would forget him and marry Wallace Sayre
She would have luxury and gaiety and the things that belong to youth

He was not particularly bitter about that He knew now that he had given
her real love something very different from that early madness of his
but he knew it too late

He looked up at Bassett and then sat up

What sort of news he asked his voice still thick with sleep

Get up and put some cold water on your head I want you to get this

He obeyed but without enthusiasm Some new clue some hope revived only
to die again what did it matter But he stopped by Bassett and put a
hand on his shoulder

Why do you do it he asked Why dont you let me go to the devil in
my own way

I started this and by Heaven Ive finished it was Bassetts exultant
reply

He sat down and produced a bundle of papers Im going to read you
something he said And when Im through youre going to put your
clothes on and well go to the Biltmore The Biltmore Do you get it

Then he began to read

I the undersigned being of sound mind do hereby make the following
statement I make the statement of my own free will and swear before
Almighty God that it is the truth I am an illegitimate son of Elihu
Clark My mother Harriet Burgess has since married and is now known as
Hattie Thorwald She will confirm the statements herein contained

I was adopted by a woman named Hines of the city of Omaha whose name
I took Some years later this woman married and had a daughter of whom
I shall speak later

I attended preparatory school in the East and was sent during
vacations to a tutoring school owned by Mr Henry Livingstone When I
went to college Mr Livingstone bought a ranch at Dry River Wyoming
and I spent some time there now and then

I learned that I was being supported and sent to college from funds
furnished by a firm of New York lawyers and that aroused my suspicion
I knew that Mrs Hines was not my mother I finally learned that I was
the son of Elihu Clark and Harriet Burgess

I felt that I should have some part of the estate and I developed a
hatred of Judson Clark whom I knew I made one attempt to get money
from him by mail threatening to expose his fathers story but I did
not succeed

I visited my mother Hattie Thorwald and threatened to kill Clark I
also threatened Henry Livingstone and his death came during a dispute
over the matter but I did not kill him He fell down and hit his head
He had a weak heart

My fostersister had gone on the stage and Clark was infatuated with
her I saw him a number of times but he did not connect me with the
letter I had sent My fostersisters stage name is Beverly Carlysle

She married Howard Lucas and they visited the Clark ranch at Norada
Wyoming in the fall of 1911 I saw my sister there several times
and as she knew the way I felt she was frightened My mother Hattie
Thorwald was a sort of maid to her and together they tried to get me
to go away

Bassett looked up

Up to that point he said I wrote it myself before I saw him There
was a note of triumph in his voice The rest is his

On the night Lucas was killed I was to go away Bev had agreed to give
me some money for the piece had quit in June and I was hard up She
was going to borrow it from Jud Clark and that set me crazy I felt it
ought to be mine or a part of it anyhow

I was to meet my mother in the grounds but I missed her and I went to
the house I wasnt responsible for what I did I was crazy I guess
I saw Donaldson on the side porch and beyond him were Lucas and Clark
playing roulette It made me wild I couldnt have played roulette that
night for pennies

I went around the house and in the front door What I meant to do was
to walk into that room and tell Clark who I was He knew me and all I
meant to do was to call Bev down and mother and make him sit up and
take notice I hadnt a gun on me

I swear I wasnt thinking of killing him then I hated him like poison
but that was all But I went into the livingroom and I heard Clark
say hed lost a thousand dollars Maybe you dont get that A thousand
dollars thrown around like that and me living on what Bev could borrow
from him

That sent me wild Lucas took a gun from him just after that and said
he was going to put it in the other room He did it too He put it on a
table and started back I got it and pointed it at Clark Id have shot
him too but Bev came into the room

I want to exonerate Bev She has been better than most sisters to me
and she has lied to try to save me She came up behind me and grabbed my
arm Lucas had heard her and he turned I must have closed my hand on
the trigger for it went off and hit him

I was in the livingroom when Donaldson ran in I hid there until they
were all gathered around Lucas and had quit running in and then I
got away I saw my mother in the grounds later I told her where the
revolver was and that theyd better put it in the billiard room I was
afraid theyd suspect Bev

I have read the above statement and it is correct I was legally
adopted by Mrs Alice Ford Hines of Omaha and use that signature I
generally use the name of Frederick Gregory which I took when I was on
the stage for a short time

Signed Clifton HINES


Bassett folded up the papers and put them in the envelope I got
that he said at the point of a gun my friend And our friend Hines
departed for the Mexican border on the evening train I dont mind
saying that I saw him off He held out for a getaway and I guess its
just as well

He glanced at Dick lying still and rigid on the bed

And now he said I think a little drink wont do us any harm

Dick refused to drink He was endeavoring to comprehend the situation
to realize that Gregory who had faced him with such sneering hate a day
or so before was his halfbrother

Poor devil he said at last I wish to God Id known He was right
you know No wonder

Sometime later he roused from deep study and looked at Bassett

How did you get the connection

I saw Melis and learned that Hines was in it somehow He was the
connecting link between Beverly Carlysle and the Thorwald woman But I
couldnt connect him with Beverly herself except by a chance I wired
a man I knew in Omaha and he turned up the second marriage and a
daughter known on the stage as Beverly Carlysle

Bassett was in high spirits He moved about the room immensely pleased
with himself slightly boastful

Some little stroke Dick he said What price Mr Judson Clark
tonight eh It will be worth a million dollars to see Wilkins face
when he reads that thing

Theres no mention of me as Livingstone in it is there

It wasnt necessary to go into that I didnt knowLook here he
exploded youre not going to be a damned fool are you

Im not going to revive Judson Clark Bassett I dont owe him
anything Let him die a decent death and stay dead

Oh piffle Bassett groaned Dont start that all over again Dont
pull any Enoch Arden stuff on me looking in at a lighted window and
wandering off to drive a taxicab

Suddenly Dick laughed Bassett watched him puzzled and angry with a
sort of savage tenderness

Youre crazy he said morosely Darned if I understand you Here Ive
got everything fixed as slick as a whistle and it took work believe
me And now you say youre going to chuck the whole thing

Not at all Dick replied with a new ring in his voice Youre right
Ive been ten sorts of a fool but I know now what Im going to do Take
your paper old friend and for my sake go out and clear Jud Clark Put
up a headstone to him if you like a good one Ill buy it

And what will you be doing in the meantime

Dick stretched and threw out his arms

Me he said What should I be doing old man Im going home




XLV

Lucy Crosby was dead One moment she was of the quick moving about the
house glancing in at David having Minnie in the kitchen pin and unpin
her veil and the next she was still and infinitely mysterious on her
white bed She had fallen outside the door of Davids room and lay
there her arms still full of fresh bath towels and a fixed and intense
look in her eyes as though outside the door she had come face to face
with a messenger who bore surprising news Doctor Reynolds running up
the stairs found her there dead and closed the door into Davids room

But David knew before they told him He waited until they had placed her
on her bed had closed her eyes and drawn a white coverlet over her and
then he went in alone and sat down beside her and put a hand over her
chilling one

If you are still here Lucy he said and have not yet gone on I
want you to carry this with you We are all right here Everybody is
all right You are not to worry

After a time he went back to his room and got his prayerbook He could
hear Harrison Millers voice soothing Minnie in the lower hall and
Reynolds at the telephone He went back into the quiet chamber and
opening the prayerbook began to read aloud

Now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them
that slept

His voice tightened He put his head down on the side of the bed

He was very docile that day He moved obediently from his room for
the awful aftermath of a death for the sweeping and dusting and clean
curtains and sat in Dicks room not reading not even praying a
lonely yet indomitable old figure When his friends came elderly men
who creaked in and tried to reduce their robust voices to a decorous
whisper he shook hands with them and made brief courteous replies
Then he lapsed into silence They felt shut off and uncomfortable and
creaked out again

Only once did he seem shaken That was when Elizabeth came swiftly in
and put her arms around him as he sat He held her close to him saying
nothing for a long time Then he drew a deep breath

I was feeling mighty lonely my dear he said

He was the better for her visit He insisted on dressing that evening
and on being helped down the stairs The town which had seemed inimical
for so long appeared to him suddenly to be holding out friendly hands
More than friendly hands Loving tender hands offering service and
affection and oldtime friendship It moved about sedately in
dark clothes and came down the stairs redeyed and using
pockethandkerchiefs and it surrounded him with love and loving
kindness

When they had all gone Harrison Miller helped him up the stairs to where
his tidy bed stood ready and the nurse had placed his hot milk on a
stand But Harrison did not go at once

What about word to Dick David he inquired awkwardly Ive called
up Bassett but hes away And I dont know that Dick ought to come back
anyhow If the police are on the job at all theyll be on the lookout
now Theyll know he may try to come

David looked away Just how much he wanted Dick to tide him over these
bad hours only David knew But he could not have him He stared at the
glass of hot milk

I guess I can fight this out alone Harrison he said And Lucy will
understand

He did not sleep much that night Once or twice he got up and tiptoed
across the hall into Lucys room and looked at her She was as white
as her pillow and quite serene Her hands always a little rough and
twisted with service were smooth and rested

You know why he cant come Lucy he said once It doesnt mean that
he doesnt care You have to remember that His sublime faith that she
heard and understood not the Lucy on the bed but the Lucy who had not
yet gone on to the blessed company of heaven carried him back to his
bed comforted and reassured

He was up and about his room early The odor of baking muffins and
frying ham came up the stairwell and the sound of Mike vigorously
polishing the floor in the hall Mixed with the odor of cooking and of
floor wax was the scent of flowers from Lucys room and Mrs Sayres
machine stopped at the door while the chauffeur delivered a great mass
of roses

David went carefully down the stairs and into his office and there at
his long deserted desk commenced a letter to Dick

He was sitting there when Dick came up the street

The thought that he was going home had upheld Dick through the days that
followed Bassetts departure for the West He knew that it would be a
fight that not easily does a man step out of life and into it again
but after his days of inaction he stood ready to fight For David for
Lucy and if it was not too late for Elizabeth When Bassetts wire
came from Norada All clear he set out for Haverly more nearly happy
than for months The very rhythm of the train sang Going home going
home

At the Haverly station the agent stopped stared at him and then nodded
gravely There was something restrained in his greeting like the
voices in the old house the night before and Dick felt a chill of
apprehension He never thought of Lucy but David The flowers and
ribbon at the door were his first intimation and still it was David
he thought of He went cold and bitter standing on the freshly washed
pavement staring at them It was all too late David David

He went into the house slowly and the heavy scent of flowers greeted
him The hall was empty and automatically he pushed open the door to
Davids office and went in David was at the desk writing David was
alive Thank God and thank God David was alive

David he said brokenly Dear old David And was suddenly shaken
with dry terrible sobbing

There was a great deal to do and Dick was grateful for it But first
like David he went in and sat by Lucys bed alone and talked to her
Not aloud as David did but still with that same queer conviction that
she heard He told her he was free and that she need not worry about
David that he was there now to look after him and he asked her if she
could to help him with Elizabeth Then he kissed her and went out

He met Elizabeth that day She had come to the house and after her
custom now went up unwarned to Davids room She found David there and
Harrison Miller andit was a moment before she realized itDick by
the mantel He was greatly changed She saw that But she had no feeling
of pity nor even of undue surprise She felt nothing at all It gave
her a curious almost hard little sense of triumph to see that he had
gone pale She marched up to him and held out her hand mindful of the
eyes on her

Im so very sorry Dick she said You have a sad homecoming

Then she withdrew her hand still calm and turned to David

Mother sent over some things Ill give them to Minnie she said her
voice clear and steady She went out and they heard her descending the
stairs

She was puzzled to find out that her knees almost gave way on the
staircase for she felt calm and without any emotion whatever And she
finished her errand so collected and poised that the two or three women
who had come in to help stared after her as she departed

Do you suppose shes seen him

She was in Davids room She must have

Mindful of Mike they withdrew into Lucys sittingroom and closed the
door there to surmise and to wonder Did he know she was engaged to
Wallie Sayre Would she break her engagement now or not Did Dick for a
moment think that he could do as he had done go away and jilt a girl
and come back to be received as though nothing had happened Because if
he did

To Dick Elizabeths greeting had been a distinct shock He had not known
just what he had expected certainly he had not hoped to pick things up
where he had dropped them But there was a hard friendliness in it that
was like a slap in the face He had meant at least to fight to win back
with her but he saw now that there would not even be a fight She was
not angry or hurt The barrier was more hopeless than that

David watching him waited until Harrison had gone and went directly
to the subject

Have you ever stopped to think what these last months have meant to
Elizabeth Her own worries and always this infernal town talking
talking The childs prides been hurt as well as her heart

I thought Id better not go into that until afteruntil later
he explained The other thing was wrong I knew it the moment I saw
Beverly and I didnt go back again What was the use Butyou saw her
face David I think she doesnt even care enough to hate me

Shes cared enough to engage herself to Wallace Sayre

After one astounded glance Dick laughed bitterly

That looks as though she cared he said He had gone very white After
a time as David sat silent and thoughtful he said After all what
right had I to expect anything else When you think that a few days
ago I was actually shaken at the thought of seeing another woman you
can hardly blame her

She waited a long time

Later Dick made what was a difficult confession under the circumstances

I know nowI think I knew all along but the other thing was like that
craving for liquor I told you aboutI know now that she has always
been the one woman Youll understand that perhaps but she wouldnt
I would crawl on my knees to make her believe it but its too late
Everythings too late he added

Before the hour for the services he went in again and sat by Lucys bed
but she who had given him wise counsel so many times before lay in her
majestic peace surrounded by flowers and infinitely removed Yet she
gave him something Something of her own peace Once more as on the
night she had stood at the kitchen door and watched him disappear in the
darkness there came the tug of the old familiar things the home sense
Not only David now but the house The faded carpet on the stairs the
old selfrocker Lucy had loved the creaking faucets in the bathroom
Mike and Minnie the laboratoryunited in their shabby strength they
were home to him They had come back never to be lost again Home

Then little by little they carried their claim further They were
not only home They were the setting of a dream long forgotten but now
vivid in his mind and a refuge from the dreary present That dream had
seen Elizabeth enshrined among the old familiar things the old house
was to be a sanctuary for her and for him From it and from her in the
dream he was to go out in the morning to it and to her he was to come
home at night after he had done a mans work

The dream faded Before him rose her face of the morning impassive and
cool her eyes not hostile but indifferent She had taken herself
out of his life had turned her youth to youth and forgotten him He
understood and accepted it He saw himself as he must have looked to
her old and worn scarred from the last months infinitely changed And
she was young Heavens how young she was

Lucy was buried the next afternoon It was raining and the quiet
procession followed Dick and the others who carried her light body under
grotesquely bobbing umbrellas Then he and David and Minnie and Mike
went back to the house quiet with that strange emptiness that follows a
death the unconscious listening for a voice that will not speak again
for a familiar footfall David had not gone upstairs He sat in Lucys
sittingroom in his old frock coat and black tie with a knitted afghan
across his knees His throat looked withered in his loose collar And
there for the first time they discussed the future

Youre giving up a great deal Dick David said Im proud of
you and like you I think the moneys best where it is But this is a
prejudiced town and they think youve treated Elizabeth badly If you
dont intend to tell the story

Never Dick announced firmly Judson Clark is dead He smiled
at David with something of his old humor I told Bassett to put up a
monument if he wanted to But youre right about one thing Theyre not
ready to take me back Ive seen it a dozen times in the last two days

I never gave up a fight yet Davids voice was grim

On the other hand I dont want to make it uncomfortable for her
We are bound to meet Im putting my own feeling aside It doesnt
matterexcept of course to me What I thought wasWe might go into the
city Reynolds would buy the house Hes going to be married

But he found himself up against the stone wall of Davids opposition He
was too old to be uprooted He liked to be able to find his way around
in the dark He was almost childish about it and perhaps a trifle
terrified But it was his final argument that won Dick over

I thought youd found out theres nothing in running away from
trouble

Dick straightened

Youre right he said Well stay here and fight it out together

He helped David up the stairs to where the nurse stood waiting and then
went on into his own bedroom He surveyed it for the first time since
his return with a sense of permanency and intimacy Here from now on
was to center his life From this bed he would rise in the morning
to go back to it at night From this room he would go out to fight for
place again and for the old faith in him for confiding eyes and the
clasp of friendly hands

He sat down by the window and with the feeling of dismissing them
forever retraced slowly and painfully the last few months the night on
the mountains and Bassett asleep by the fire the man from the cabin
caught under the tree with his face looking up strangely twisted from
among the branches dawn in the alfalfa field and the long night tramp
the boy who had recognized him in Chicago David in his old walnut bed
shrivelled and dauntless and his own going out into the night
with Lucy in the kitchen doorway Elizabeth and Wallace Sayre on the
verandah and himself across the street under the trees Beverly and
the illumination of his freedom from the old bonds Gregory glib and
debonair telling his lying story and later on flying to safety His
halfbrother

All that and now this quiet room with David asleep beyond the wall and
Minnie moving heavily in the kitchen below setting her bread to rise
It was anticlimacteric ridiculous wonderful

Then he thought of Elizabeth and it became terrible

After Reynolds came up he put on a dressinggown and went down the
stairs The office was changed and looked strange and unfamiliar But
when he opened the door and went into the laboratory nothing had been
altered there It was as though he had left it yesterday the microscope
screwed to its stand the sterilizer gleaming and ready It was as
though it had waited for him

He was content He would fight and he would work That was all a man
needed a good fight and work for his hands and brain A man could live
without love if he had work


He sat down on the stool and groaned




XLVI

One thing Dick knew must be done and got over with He would have to see
Elizabeth and tell her the story He knew it would do no good but she
had a right to the fullest explanation he could give her She did not
love him but it was intolerable that she should hate him

He meant however to make no case for himself He would have to stand
on the facts This thing had happened to him the storm had come
wrought its havoc and passed he was back to start again as nearly as
he could where he had left off That was all

He went to the Wheeler house the next night passing the door twice
before he turned in and rang the bell in order that his voice might be
calm and his demeanor unshaken But the fact that Micky waiting on the
porch knew him and broke into yelps of happiness and ecstatic wriggling
almost lost him his selfcontrol

Walter Wheeler opened the door and admitted him

I thought you might come he said Come in

There was no particular warmth in his voice but no unfriendliness He
stood by gravely while Dick took off his overcoat and then led the way
into the library

Id better tell you at once he said that I have advised Elizabeth
to see you but that she refuses Id much prefer He busied himself
at the fire for a moment Id much prefer to have her see you
Livingstone ButIll tell you franklyI dont think it would do much
good

He sat down and stared at the fire Dick remained standing She doesnt
intend to see me at all he asked unsteadily

Thats rather out of the question if you intend to remain here Do
you

Yes

An unexpected feeling of sympathy for the tall young man on the hearth
rug stirred in Walter Wheelers breast

Im sorry Dick She apparently reached the breaking point a week or
two ago She knew you had been here and hadnt seen her for one thing
He hesitated Youve heard of her engagement

Yes

I didnt want it her father said drearily I suppose she knows her
own business but the things done She sent you a message he added
after a pause Shes glad its cleared up and I believe you are not to
allow her to drive you away She thinks David needs you

Thank you Ill have to stay as she says

There was another uncomfortable silence Then Walter Wheeler burst out

Confound it Dick Im sorry Ive fought your battles for months
not here but everywhere But heres a battle I cant fight She isnt
angry Youll have to get her angle of it I think its something like
this She had built you up into a sort of superman And sheswell I
suppose purity is the word Shes the essence of purity Then Leslie
told me this tonight she learned from him that you were back with the
woman in the case in New York

And as Dick made a gesture

Theres no use going to him He was off the beaten track and he knows
it He took a chance to tell her for her own good Hes fond of her I
suppose that was the last straw

He sat still a troubled figure middleaged and unhandsome and very
weary

Its a bad business Dick he said

After a time Dick stirred

When I first began to remember he said I wanted whisky I would
have stolen it if I couldnt have got it any other way Then when I
got it I didnt want it It sickened me This other was the same sort
of thing Its done with

Wheeler nodded

I understand But she wouldnt Dick

No I dont suppose she would

He went away soon after that back to the quiet house and to David
Automatically he turned in at his office but Reynolds was writing
there He went slowly up the stairs

Ann Sayre was frankly puzzled during the next few days She had had a
week or so of serenity and anticipation and although things were not
quite as she would have had them Elizabeth too impassive and even
Wallie rather restrained in his happiness she was satisfied But Dick
Livingstones return had somehow changed everything

It had changed Wallie too He was suddenly a man and not she
suspected a very happy man He came back one day for instance to say
that he had taken a partnership in a brokerage office and gave as his
reason that he was sick of playing round She rather thought it was to
take his mind off something

A few days after the funeral she sent for Doctor Reynolds I caught
cold at the cemetery she said when he had arrived and was seated
opposite her in her boudoir I really did she protested as she
caught his eye I suppose everybody is sending for you to have a
chance to talk

Just about

You cant blame us Particularly you cant blame me Ive got to know
something doctor Is he going to stay

I think so Yes

Isnt he going to explain anything He cant expect just to walk back
into his practise after all these months and the talk thats been going
on and do nothing about it

I dont see what his going away has to do with it Hes a good doctor
and a hard worker When Im gone

Youre going are you

Yes I may live here and have an office in the city I dont care for
general practise theres no future in it I may take a special course
in nose and throat

But she was not interested in his plans

I want to know something and only you can tell me Im not curious
like the rest I think I have a right to know Has he seen Elizabeth
Wheeler yet Talked to her I mean

I dont know Im inclined to think not he added cautiously

You mean that he hasnt

Look here Mrs Sayre Youve confided in me and I know its important
to you I dont know a thing Im to stay on until the end of the week
and then he intends to take hold Im in and out see him at meals and
weve had a little desultory talk There is no trouble between the two
families Mr Wheeler comes and goes If you ask me I think Livingstone
has simply accepted the situation as he found it

He isnt going to explain anything Hell have to I think if he
expects to practise here There have been all sorts of stories

I dont know Mrs Sayre

How is Doctor David she asked after a pause

Better It wouldnt surprise me now to see him mend rapidly

He met Elizabeth on his way down the hill a strange brighteyed
Elizabeth carrying her head high and a bit too jauntily and with a
sort of hot defiance in her eyes He drove on thoughtfully All this
turmoil and trouble anxiety and fear and all that was left a crushed
and tragic figure of a girl and two men in an old house preparing to
fight that one of them might regain the place he had lost

It would be a fight Reynolds saw the village already divided into two
camps a small militant minority aligned with Dick and David and a
waiting not particularly hostile but intensely curious majority
who would demand certain things before Dicks reinstatement in their
confidence

Elizabeth Wheeler was an unconscious party to the division It was in
a way her battle they were fighting And Elizabeth had gone over to the
enemy

Late that afternoon Ann Sayre had her first real talk with Wallie since
Dicks return She led him out onto the terrace her shoulders militant
and her head high and faced him there

I can see you are not going to talk to me she said So Ill talk to
you Has Dick Livingstones return made any change between Elizabeth and
you

No

Shes just the same to you You must tell me Wallace Ive been
building so much

She realized the change in him then more fully than ever for he faced
her squarely and without evasion

Theres no change in her mother but I think you and I will both have
to get used to this shes not in love with me She doesnt pretend to
be

Dont tell me its still that man

I dont know He took a turn or two about the terrace I dont think
it is mother I dont think she cares for anybody that way certainly
not for me And thats the trouble He faced her again If marrying
me isnt going to make her happy I wont hold her to it Youll have to
support me in that mother Im a pretty weak sister sometimes

That appeal touched her as nothing had done for a long time Ill help
all I can if the need comes she said and turned and went heavily
into the house




XLVII

David was satisfied The great love of his life had been given to Dick
and now Dick was his again He grieved for Lucy but he knew that the
parting was not for long and that from whatever high place she looked
down she would know that He was satisfied He looked on his work and
found it good There was no trace of weakness nor of vacillation in the
man who sat across from him at the table or slammed in and out of the
house after his old fashion

But he was not content At first it was enough to have Dick there to
stop in the doorway of his room and see him within occupied with the
prosaic business of getting into his clothes or out of them now
and then to put a hand on his shoulder to hear him fussing in the
laboratory again and to be called to examine divers and sundry smears
to which Dick attached impressive importance and more impressive names
But behind Dicks surface cheerfulness he knew that he was eating his
heart out

And there was nothing to be done Nothing Secretly David watched the
papers for the announcement of Elizabeths engagement and each day drew
a breath of relief when it did not come And he had done another thing
secretly too he did not tell Dick when her ring came back Annie had
brought the box without a letter and the incredible cruelty of the
thing made David furious He stamped into his office and locked it in a
drawer with the definite intention of saving Dick that one additional
pang at a time when he already had enough to hear

For things were going very badly The fight was on

It was a battle without action Each side was dug in and entrenched and
waiting It was an engagement where the principals met occasionally the
neutral ground of the streets bowed to each other and passed on

The town was sorry for David and still fond of him but it resented his
stiffnecked attitude It said in effect that when he ceased to make
Dicks enemies his it was willing to be friends But it said also to
each other and behind its hands that Dicks absence was discreditable
or it would be explained and that he had behaved abominably to
Elizabeth It would be hanged if it would be friends with him

It looked away but it watched Dick knew that when he passed by on the
streets it peered at him from behind its curtains and whispered behind
his back Now and then he saw on his evening walks that line of cars
drawn up before houses he had known and frequented which indicated a
party but he was never asked He never told David

It was only when the taboo touched David that Dick was resentful and
then he was inclined to question the wisdom of his return It hurt
him for instance to see David give up his church and reading morning
prayer alone at home on Sunday mornings and to see his grim silence
when some of his old friends were mentioned

Yet on the surface things were much as they had been David rose early
and as he improved in health read his morning paper in his office
while he waited for breakfast Doctor Reynolds had gone and the desk in
Dicks office was back where it belonged In the mornings Mike oiled
the car in the stable and washed it his old pipe clutched in his teeth
while from the kitchen came the sounds of pans and dishes and the odor
of frying sausages And Dick splashed in the shower and shaved by the
mirror with the cracked glass in the bathroom But he did not sing

The house was very quiet Now and then the front door opened and a
patient came in but there was no longer the crowded waitingroom
the incessant jangle of the telephone the odor of pungent drugs and
antiseptics

When shortly before Christmas Dick looked at the books containing the
last quarters accounts he began to wonder how long they could fight
their losing battle He did not mind for himself but it was unthinkable
that David should do without one by one the small luxuries of his old
age his cigars his long and now errandless rambles behind Nettie

He began then to think of his property his for the claiming and to
question whether he had not bought his peace at too great a cost to
David He knew by that time that it was not fear but pride which had
sent him back emptyhanded the pride of making his own way And now and
then too he felt a perfectly human desire to let Bassett publish the
story as his vindication and then snatch David away from them all
to some luxurious haven wherethat was the point at which he always
stoppedwhere David could pine away in homesickness for them

There was an irony in it that made him laugh hopelessly

He occupied himself then with ways and means and sold the car
Reynolds about to be married and busily furnishing a city office
bought it had it repainted a bright blue and signified to the world at
large that he was at the Rossiter house every night by leaving it at
the curb Sometimes on long country tramps Dick saw it outside a
farmhouse and knew that the boycott was not limited to the town

By Christmas however he realized that the question of meeting their
expenses necessitated further economies and reluctantly at last they
decided to let Mike go Dick went out to the stable with a distinct
sinking of the heart while David sat in the house unhappily waiting
for the thing to be done But Mike refused to be discharged

And is it discharging me you are he asked putting down one of
Davids boots in his angry astonishment Well then Im telling you
youre not

We cant pay you any longer Mike And now that the cars gone

Im not thinking about pay Im not going and thats flat Whod be
after doing his boots and all

David called him in that night and dismissed him again this time very
firmly Mike said nothing and went out but the next morning he was
scrubbing the sidewalk as usual and after that they gave it up

Now and then Dick and Elizabeth met on the street and she bowed to him
and went on At those times it seemed incredible that once he had held
her in his arms and that she had looked up at him with loving faithful
eyes He suffered so from those occasional meetings that he took to
watching for her so as to avoid her Sometimes he wished she would
marry Wallace quickly so he would be obliged to accept what now he knew
he had not accepted at all

He had occasional spells of violent anger at her and of resentment but
they died when he checked up one after the other the inevitable series
of events that had led to the catastrophe But it was all nonsense
to say that love never died She had loved him and there was never
anything so dead as that love of hers

He had been saved one thing however he had never seen her with Wallie
Sayre Then one day in the country while he trudged afoot to make one
of his rare professional visits they went past together in Wallies
bright roadster The sheer shock of it sent him against a fence staring
after them with an anger that shook him

Late in November Elizabeth went away for a visit and it gave him
a breathing spell But the strain was telling on him and Bassett
stopping on his way to dinner at the Wheelers told him so bluntly

You look pretty rotten he said Its no time to go to pieces now
when youve put up your fight and won it

Im all right I havent been sleeping Thats all

How about the business People coming to their senses

Not very fast Dick admitted Of course its a little soon

After dinner at the Wheelers when Walter Wheeler had gone to a vestry
meeting Bassett delivered himself to Margaret of a highly indignant
harangue on the situation in general

Thats how I see it he finished Hes done a fine thing A finer
thing by a damned sight than Id do or any of this town Hes given up
money enough to pay the national debtor nearly If hed come back
with it as Judson Clark they wouldnt have cared a hang for the past
Theyd have licked his boots It makes me sick

He turned on her

You too I think Mrs Wheeler Im not attacking you on that score
its human nature But its the truth

Perhaps I dont know

Theyll drive him to doing it yet He came back to make a place for
himself again like a man Not what he had but what he was But theyll
drive him away mark my words

Later on but more gently he introduced the subject of Elizabeth

You cant get away from this Mrs Wheeler So long as she stands off
and you behind her the town is going to take her side She doesnt know
it but thats how it stands It all hangs on her If he wasnt the man
he is Id say his salvation hangs on her I dont mean she ought to
take him back its too late for that if shes engaged But a little
friendliness and kindness wouldnt do any harm You too Do you ever
have him here

How can I as things are

Well be friendly anyhow he argued Thats not asking much I
suppose hed cut my throat if he knew but Im a straighttothemark
sort of person and I know this what this house does the town will do

Ill talk to Mr Wheeler I dont know Ill say this Mr Bassett
I wont make her unhappy She has borne a great deal and sometimes I
think her life is spoiled She is very different

If she is suffering isnt it possible she cares for him

But Margaret did not think so She was so very calm She was so calm
that sometimes it was alarming

He gave her a ring and the other day I found it tossed into a drawer
full of odds and ends I havent seen it lately she may have sent it
back

Elizabeth came home shortly before Christmas undeniably glad to be back
and very gentle with them all She set to work almost immediately on the
gifts wrapping them and tying them with methodical exactness sticking
a tiny sprig of holly through the ribbon bow and writing cards with
neatness and care She hung up wreaths and decorated the house and
when she was through with her work she went to her room and sat with her
hands folded not thinking She did not think any more

Wallie had sent her a flexible diamond bracelet as a Christmas gift and
it lay on her table in its box She was very grateful but she had not
put it on

On the morning before Christmas Nina came in her arms full of packages
and her eyes shining and a little frightened She had some news for
them She hadnt been so keen about it at first but Leslie was like a
madman He was so pleased that he was ordering her that sable cape she
had wanted so He was like a different man And it would be July

Elizabeth kissed her It seemed very unreal like everything else She
wondered why Leslie should be so excited or her mother crying She
wondered if there was something strange about her that it should see so
small and unimportant But then what was important That one got up
in the morning and ate at intervals and went to bed at night That
children came and had to be fed and washed and tended and cried a
great deal and were sick now and then

She wished she could feel something could think it vital whether Nina
should choose pink or blue for her layette and how far she should
walk each day and if the chauffeur drove the car carefully enough
She wished she cared whether it was going to rain tomorrow or not or
whether some one was coming or not coming And she wished terribly that
she could care for Wallie or get over the feeling that she had saved
her pride at a cost to him she would not contemplate

After a time she went upstairs and put on the bracelet And late in the
afternoon she went out and bought some wool to make an afghan It eased
her conscience toward Nina She commenced it that evening while she
waited for Wallie and she wondered if some time she would be making an
afghan for a coming child of her own Hers and Wallace Sayres

Suddenly she knew she would never marry him She faced the future with
all that it implied and she knew she could not do it It was horrible
that she had even contemplated it It would be terrible to tell Wallie
but not as terrible as the other thing She saw herself then with the
same clearness with which she had judged Dick She too leaving her
havoc of wrecked lives behind her she too going along her headstrong
way raising hopes not to be fulfilled and passing on She too

That evening Christmas eve she told Wallie she would not marry him
Told him very gently and just after an attempt of his to embrace her
She would not let him do it

I dont know whats come over you he said morosely But Ill let you
alone if thats the way you feel

Im sorry Wallie Itit makes me shiver

In a way he was prepared for it but nevertheless he begged for time
for a less unequivocal rejection But he found her for the first time
impatient with his pleadings

I dont want to go over and over it Wallie Ill take the blame I
should have done it long ago

She was gentle almost tender with him but when he said she had spoiled
his life for him she smiled faintly

You think that now And dont believe Im not sorry I am I hate not
playing the game as you say But I dont think for a moment that youll
go on caring when you know I dont That doesnt happen Thats all

Do you know what I think he burst out I think youre still mad
about Livingstone I think you are so mad about him that you dont know
it yourself

But she only smiled her cool smile and went on with her knitting After
that he got himself in hand andperhaps he still had some hope It
was certain that she had not flinched at Dicks nametold her very
earnestly that he only wanted her happiness He didnt want her unless
she wanted him He would always love her

Not always she said with tragically cold certainty Men are not
like women they forget

She wondered after he had gone what had made her say that

She did not tell the family that night They were full of their own
concerns Ninas coming maternity the wrapping of packages behind
closed doors the final trimming of the tree in the library Leslie
had started the phonograph and it was playing Stille Nacht heilige
Nacht

Still night holy night and only in her was there a stillness that was
not holy

They hung up their stockings valiantly as usual making a little
ceremony of it and being careful not to think about Jims missing one
Indeed they made rather a function of it and Leslie demanded one of
Ninas baby socks and pinned it up

Im starting a bank account for the little beggar he said and
dropped a gold piece into the toe Next year old girl

He put his arm around Nina It seemed to him that life was doing
considerably better than he deserved by him and he felt very humble and
contrite He felt in his pocket for the square jewelers box that lay
there

After that they left Walter Wheeler there to play his usual part at
such times and went upstairs He filled the stockings bravely an
orange in each toe a box of candy a toy for old times sake and then
the little knickknacks he had been gathering for days and hiding in
his desk After all there were no fewer stockings this year than last
Instead of Jims there was the tiny one for Ninas baby That was the
way things went He took away but also He gave

He sat back in his deep chair and looked up at the stockings
ludicrously bulging After all if he believed that He gave and took
away then he must believe that Jim was where he had tried to think him
filling a joyous active place in some boyish heaven

After a while he got up and went to his desk and getting pen and paper
wrote carefully

Dearest You will find this in your stocking in the morning when you
get up for the early service And I want you to think over it in the
church It is filled with tenderness and with anxiety Life is not so
very long little daughter and it has no time to waste in anger or in
bitterness A little work a little sleep a little love and it is all
over

Will you think of this today

He locked up the house and went slowly up to bed Elizabeth found the
letter the next morning She stood in the bleak room with the ashes of
last nights fire still smoking and the stockings overhead not festive
in the gray light but looking forlorn and abandoned Suddenly her eyes
dry and fiercely burning for so long were wet with tears It was true
It was true A little work a little sleep a little love Not the
great love perhaps not the only love of a mans life Not the love of
yesterday but of today and tomorrow

All the fierce repression of the last weeks was gone She began to
suffer She saw Dick coming home perhaps high with hope that whatever
she knew she would understand and forgive And she saw herself failing
him cold and shut away not big enough nor woman enough to meet him
half way She saw him fighting his losing battle alone protecting David
but never himself carrying Lucy to her quiet grave sitting alone in
his office while the village walked by and stared at the windows she
saw him gaining harbor after storm and finding no anchorage there

She turned and went half blindly into the empty street

She thought he was at the early service She did not see him but she
had once again the thing that had seemed lost forever the warm sense of
his thought of her

He was there in the shadowy back pew with the grill behind it through
which once insistent hands had reached to summon him He was there with
Lucys prayerbook in his hand and none of the peace of the day in his
heart He knelt and rose with the others

O God who makest us glad with the yearly remembrance of the birth of
Thy Son




XLVIII

David was beaten most tragic defeat of all beaten by those he had
loved and faithfully served

He did not rise on Christmas morning and Dick visiting him after an
almost untasted breakfast found him still in his bed and questioned him
anxiously

Im all right he asserted Im tired Dick thats all Tired of
fighting Youre young You can carry it on and win But Ill never see
it Theyre stronger than we are

Later he elaborated on that He had kept the faith He had run with
courage the race that was set before him He had stayed up at night and
fought for them But he couldnt fight against them

Dick went downstairs again and shutting himself in his office fell to
pacing the floor David was right the thing was breaking him Very
seriously now he contemplated abandoning the town taking David with
him and claiming his estate They could travel then he could get
consultants in Europe there were baths there and treatments

The doorbell rang He heard Minnies voice in the hail not too
friendly and her tap at the door

Some one in the waitingroom she called

When he opened the connecting door he found Elizabeth beyond it a
pale and frightened Elizabeth breathless and very still It was a
perceptible moment before he could control his voice to speak Then

I suppose you want to see David Im sorry but he isnt well today
He is still in bed

I didnt come to see David Dick

I cannot think you want to see me Elizabeth

I do if you dont mind

He stood aside then and let her pass him into the rear office

But he was not fooled at all Not he He had been enough He knew
why she had come in the kindness of heart She was so little Good
heavens a man could crush her to nothing She had come because she was
sorry for him and she had brought forgiveness It was like her It was
fine It was damnable

His voice hardened for fear it might be soft

Is this a professional visit or a Christmas call Elizabeth Or
perhaps I shouldnt call you that

A Christmas call

You know what I mean The day of peace The daywhat do you think Im
made of Elizabeth To have you here gentle and good and kind

He got up and stood over her tall and almost threatening

Youve been to church and youve been thinking things over I know I
was there I heard it all peace on earth goodwill to men Bosh Peace
when there is no peace Good will I dont want your peace and good
will

She looked up at him timidly

You dont want to be friends then

No A thousand times no he said violently Then more gently Im
making a fool of myself I want your peace and good will Elizabeth God
knows I need them

You frighten me Dick she said slowly I didnt come to bring
forgiveness if that is what you mean I came

Dont tell me you came to ask it That would be more than I can bear

Will you listen to me for a moment Dick I am not good at explaining
things and Im nervous I suppose you can see that She tried to smile
at him Aa little work a sleep a little love thats life isnt
it

He was watching her intently

Work and trouble and a long sleep at the end for which let us be duly
thankfulthats life too Love Not every one gets love

Hopelessness and despair overwhelmed her He was making it hard for her
Impossible She could not go on

I did not come with peace she said tremulously but if you dont
want it She rose I must say this though before I go I blame
myself I dont blame you You are wrong if you think I came to forgive
you

She was stumbling toward the door

Elizabeth what did bring you

She turned to him with her hand on the door knob I came because I
wanted to see you again

He strode after her and catching her by the arm turned her until he
faced her

And why did you want to see me again You cant still care for me
You know the story You know I was here and didnt see you Youve seen
Leslie Ward You know my past What you dont know

He looked down into her eyes A little work a little sleep a little
love he repeated What did you mean by that

Just that she said simply Only not a little love Dick Maybe you
dont want me now I dont know I have suffered so much that Im not
sure of anything

Want you he said More than anything on this earth

Bassett was at his desk in the office It was late and the night
editor seeing him reading the early edition his feet on his desk
carried over his coffee and doughnuts and joined him

Sometime he said Im going to get that Clark story out of you If
it wasnt you who turned up the confession Ill eat it

Bassett yawned

Have it your own way he said indifferently You were shielding
somebody werent you No Whats the answer

Bassett made no reply He picked up the paper and pointed to an item
with the end of his pencil

Seen this

The night editor read it with bewilderment He glanced up

Whats that got to do with the Clark case

Nothing Nice people though Know them both

When the night editor walked away rather affronted Bassett took up the
paper and reread the paragraph

Mr and Mrs Walter Wheeler of Haverly announce the engagement of
their daughter Elizabeth to Doctor Richard Livingstone

He sat for a long time staring at it
